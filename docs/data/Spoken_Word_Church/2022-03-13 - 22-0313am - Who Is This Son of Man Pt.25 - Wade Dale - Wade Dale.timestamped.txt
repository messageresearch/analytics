[6:53] i've been thinking about that song all
[6:55] week we're standing on holy grounds
[6:57] it kind of came from our bible study we
[6:59] just it turned into a testimony service
[7:02] and
[7:02] everybody was talking about how god had
[7:04] protected them
[7:06] through the years through different
[7:08] times
[7:09] amen and you know i'm sure we all have
[7:12] testimonies that way and i i have one
[7:14] that way as well
[7:16] and this was once i was working in
[7:18] downtown baltimore and
[7:20] was um
[7:22] it was about four lanes of highway that
[7:23] i had to
[7:24] go across
[7:26] and um
[7:27] i didn't know the last lane was a
[7:29] turning lane
[7:31] so the lights were getting ready to
[7:32] change and i thought i'd just run across
[7:36] and i was running across just looking
[7:38] where i was going because i knew the
[7:39] cars were getting ready to go but i
[7:41] didn't realize that last lane was a
[7:43] turning lane and they had that green
[7:44] light and i was running
[7:46] and something just stopped me i didn't
[7:48] see this car but i stopped and a car
[7:50] went
[7:52] i said lord god
[7:54] my goodness thank the lord
[7:57] standing on holy ground angels all
[7:59] around amen praise the lord
[8:02] and that's part of our story victory in
[8:05] jesus we heard this we heard this story
[8:07] but we're now part of it by his grace
[8:09] amen let's sing 22.
[8:13] i heard an old
[8:16] story
[8:17] how a savior came from glory
[8:22] how he gave his life on calvary
[8:27] to
[8:28] savor it's like me
[8:32] i heard about his
[8:35] groaning of his precious blood
[8:39] [Music]
[8:41] then i
[8:43] repented of my sins and won the victory
[8:49] of
[8:51] victory
[8:52] in jesus
[8:54] my savior
[8:57] forever
[8:59] he sought me
[9:02] and he bought me
[9:04] with his
[9:05] redeeming blood
[9:08] [Music]
[9:16] [Music]
[9:17] he plunged me
[9:20] to victory
[9:22] beneath the cleansing flood
[9:27] i heard about his healing
[9:31] of his cleansing power
[9:34] revealing how he made the lame to
[9:38] walk again
[9:40] and he caused a blind to see
[9:45] and then i cried
[9:47] dear jesus
[9:49] come and heal my broken
[9:52] spirit
[9:54] and somehow jesus came and brought to me
[10:00] the victory
[10:02] oh victory oh
[10:05] in
[10:06] jesus my savior
[10:10] forever
[10:12] he sought me
[10:14] and he bought me
[10:16] with his redeeming blood
[10:21] he loved me
[10:23] i knew him and all my love is due him
[10:30] he plunged me
[10:32] to victory
[10:35] beneath the cleansing flood
[10:39] i heard about a mansion
[10:43] he has built for me and glory
[10:48] and i heard about
[10:50] the streets of gold
[10:53] beyond the crystal sea
[10:57] about the angels singing
[11:01] in the
[11:03] orientation story
[11:06] and some sweet day i'll sing up there
[11:11] the song of victory
[11:14] oh
[11:15] victory lesson
[11:17] oh jesus oh
[11:19] my savior
[11:22] forever
[11:24] sought me
[11:26] and he bought me
[11:28] with his
[11:30] redeeming blood
[11:32] he loved me oh
[11:35] i knew him and all my love is to him he
[11:42] plunged me
[11:44] to victory
[11:46] beneath the cleansing floor
[11:50] oh
[11:51] victory oh
[11:53] in jesus my savior
[11:57] forever
[11:59] he sought me
[12:01] and he bought me
[12:04] with his
[12:06] redeeming blood he loved me
[12:10] i
[12:11] knew him and all my love is to him
[12:17] he plundered me
[12:19] to
[12:20] victory
[12:22] beneath
[12:26] [Music]
[12:36] the other sudden we were going home we
[12:39] got in snail ville and
[12:42] we stopped at the light and we had a
[12:43] turning light
[12:45] and as soon as we took off
[12:47] somebody else took off from somewhere
[12:49] else that wasn't supposed to be
[12:52] and uh
[12:54] i thought
[12:55] afterwards i said
[12:57] how did i do that
[12:58] now i got thinking i didn't he did
[13:01] he saved me because it happened so fast
[13:04] i couldn't have never done it
[13:06] but uh because when i tried to take my
[13:08] foot off the accelerator and put on the
[13:10] brake it slipped off the brake
[13:12] and so
[13:14] god just
[13:15] brought us through it yeah yeah

[24:47] too he said just pray for him so let's
[24:49] go to john 1
[24:51] this will be part 25 i want to i want to
[24:54] insert something in here today
[24:56] we've been reading
[24:58] about the adoption and about
[25:01] what happens
[25:03] in the end time
[25:04] but let's look at the
[25:06] part that says we're predestinated to
[25:08] adoption
[25:10] now i know we as believers
[25:12] especially here in this church we know
[25:14] the true meaning of predestination it's
[25:16] not god pulled you through a tube god
[25:18] didn't make you do anything
[25:21] but by foreknowledge those who he
[25:23] foreknew
[25:25] so what comes first predestination no
[25:27] for knowledge comes first god foreign so
[25:29] he could predetermine what's going to
[25:32] happen before the foundation of the
[25:33] world because he's god
[25:35] amen and he knows the end from the
[25:37] beginning he knows what you'd do if
[25:38] you'd done something different
[25:41] hello
[25:42] that makes him infinite
[25:44] amen
[25:45] we're finite we can't understand that
[25:46] but maybe we can get a little bit
[25:47] understanding today
[25:49] about this predestinated to adoption
[25:52] and remember this
[25:54] predestination is your journey
[25:59] predestinated is the promise
[26:03] predestination is the journey
[26:04] predetermined destiny that's your
[26:06] journey
[26:08] but the predestinated is the promise the
[26:10] predestinated have a promise

[28:10] there i think they may be watching in
[28:12] here in a little bit but let's read our
[28:14] our scripture john 1 1 says in the
[28:16] beginning was the word the word was with
[28:17] god and the word was god
[28:19] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[28:20] among us and we beheld his glory the
[28:22] glory of the only begotten of the father
[28:23] full of grace and truth and then we'll
[28:26] get to this
[28:28] in just a minute romans 8 verse 14 for
[28:31] as many that are led by the spirit of
[28:32] god they are the sons of god for we have
[28:34] not received the spirit of bondage unto
[28:36] fear but you have received the spirit of
[28:38] adoption whereby you cry
[28:40] abba father and you may be seated in the
[28:42] lord as blessing to the reading of the
[28:43] word
[28:44] and today i want you to turn if you want
[28:46] to or you can walk look at it on the
[28:48] on the screen but i had to bring out my
[28:49] old bible i've got notes from like that
[28:51] i wrote so many notes in my old bible
[28:53] sometimes i have to bring it back out
[28:55] so we want to go to the book of
[28:56] ephesians
[28:58] and let's talk about i know some of the
[29:00] ministers have been there too but
[29:02] we're going to go through it really slow
[29:04] ephesians 1 through about 14. that's all
[29:06] right amen i want you to look at what
[29:08] god
[29:09] now remember predestination is the
[29:11] journey
[29:13] predestinated is the promise
[29:16] all right
[29:18] predestination is the journey
[29:21] predestinated is the promise
[29:24] all right and we are pre-next
[29:25] predestinated to adoption according to
[29:28] ephesians we've been reading it
[29:30] that we are predestinated to adoption
[29:32] and remember that we were talking about
[29:34] just as they were putting that up
[29:36] dispensation i've been reading too
[29:37] brother branham talks a lot about
[29:39] dispensations and stages
[29:42] and i want to clear something up and i
[29:43] really appreciate people that are
[29:45] they're watching online when they send
[29:46] emails there was a brother sent me an
[29:48] email this morning
[29:49] and he said you said that luther and
[29:52] wesley were prophets
[29:54] well a prophet is who the word comes to
[29:57] you've got my major prophets and minor
[29:59] prophets
[30:02] you got prophets in the five-fold
[30:04] ministry
[30:05] now we know that lutheran wesley were
[30:07] was reformers but did not the word come
[30:09] to lutheran wesley it wasn't three or
[30:11] four preachers in the s that had to say
[30:13] uh
[30:14] luther brought the just shall live by
[30:16] faith he was the prophet of that day
[30:19] though it may be partial though it may
[30:21] be a reformer that he didn't have all
[30:23] the loose ends tied up but that had to
[30:25] come in the promise of the end time of
[30:28] the luke 17 30 the revelations 10 7 the
[30:31] malachi 4 5 there was a major prophet to
[30:34] come in the end time to tie everything
[30:36] up but when luther preached the judge
[30:38] shall live by faith that's the same
[30:39] judgment
[30:42] justification you live by
[30:44] not different holy ghost and luther had
[30:47] the holy ghost
[30:48] all those messengers listen those were
[30:50] seven stars in the hand of god
[30:53] those must be pretty special people
[30:55] amen
[30:57] all right so when you say their prophets
[30:58] then
[30:59] i could call i could call you a prophet
[31:02] the prophet's who the word comes to but
[31:04] each there were seven
[31:06] predestinated
[31:09] by predestination
[31:11] they were predestinated to come in
[31:12] luther's age and he was the one that had
[31:14] the word for the agent if you if you
[31:16] turn luther down you turn god down
[31:19] so he was the prophet for that day
[31:22] wesley was a prophet i've got some
[31:23] quotes in here where brother brown i
[31:25] know he says they're reformers and
[31:26] that's fine they are because they didn't
[31:28] have all the word
[31:30] but they were still prophets to their
[31:31] age
[31:32] they were ones that stood up and god
[31:34] said if you don't hear that guy you're
[31:37] not going to make it
[31:38] to me that's a prophet
[31:40] amen
[31:41] now they they had their flaws and they
[31:43] had their
[31:44] um
[31:45] uh you know father some holy ghost
[31:47] baptism they couldn't put it all
[31:48] together but they were they were
[31:49] prophets enough to where you had to
[31:51] listen to what he said they were
[31:52] identified in the scriptures reading
[31:54] where brother brown talks about
[31:56] only in the end time will we be able
[31:58] were we able to name those yes
[32:01] we were not able to name you know wesley
[32:03] probably didn't stand up and say i'm the
[32:04] sixth messenger of the stat of the star
[32:06] of the hand of god no
[32:08] he just knew he had a message
[32:11] but he took a prophet in the end time a
[32:13] major prophet in the end time to go back
[32:15] in the word of god and bring out and say
[32:17] all right here we've got paul irenaeus
[32:20] martin why didn't we pick polycarp he
[32:23] explains why he didn't pick polycarp so
[32:25] he's bringing out see luther couldn't do
[32:27] that wesley couldn't do that but the
[32:28] prophet in the end time did do that
[32:31] so when i when i said lutheran wesley
[32:33] were prophets i meant they were prophets
[32:35] they were prophets for their time
[32:37] you know what you wouldn't got to heaven
[32:39] without luther's message in luther's
[32:41] time
[32:43] to me that's a prophet prophet is who
[32:45] the word comes to
[32:46] a man so the word came to luther
[32:49] in that church age all right everybody
[32:51] okay with that
[32:53] we know the reformers we know that they
[32:55] didn't have everything but they had
[32:57] enough to where god said you're going to
[32:59] listen to this man or you're not going
[33:00] to get it
[33:01] amen so to me that's good enough that's
[33:03] one of them seven stars in the hand of
[33:05] god i'd like to be considered one of the
[33:07] seven stars in the hand of god wouldn't
[33:08] you amen so we consider him a prophet
[33:12] messenger
[33:13] not like the one we got
[33:16] but one that's different than the clergy
[33:18] of the day
[33:20] look who he protested the
[33:22] world catholicism was all spreading like
[33:25] wildfire in here stands a man that says
[33:28] no
[33:30] you don't have to do novenia's you don't
[33:32] have to crawl on your hands and knees
[33:33] you don't have to see a priest you don't
[33:34] have he went against the whole world
[33:37] so i thank god that god said sent us a
[33:39] prophet that the same thing happened
[33:42] he was against the whole world
[33:44] and the whole world's against us same
[33:46] thing
[33:46] so god bless you and let's do this right
[33:48] here so in dispensations and stages we
[33:50] know that we're in a time now of the
[33:53] pre-predestinated to adoption let's
[33:55] let's read this if you want to i want
[33:57] you to look how personal
[33:58] god give this
[34:00] in the book of ephesians remember
[34:02] ephesians was what
[34:04] very mature corinthians they were all he
[34:07] was always trying to say look guys y'all
[34:08] don't need to be drinking at the
[34:11] at the lord's supper table and you don't
[34:13] need to be marrying your mother your
[34:14] stepmother and you don't need to be
[34:16] doing this you don't need to be doing
[34:17] that but now the ephesians watch what he
[34:19] does first thing he says
[34:21] he says paul an apostle of jesus christ
[34:23] by the will of god
[34:25] to the saints
[34:26] which are at ephesus
[34:28] now that was the people that were there
[34:31] and i like this next one and to the
[34:33] faithful
[34:34] in christ jesus that's us
[34:36] that's us from from paul
[34:38] speaking this to today we are the
[34:40] faithful in christ jesus grace be to you
[34:42] and peace from god our father and from
[34:44] the lord jesus christ now watch
[34:47] how this scripture unfolds now we look
[34:49] and see that adoption is in three stages
[34:52] the new birth is in three stages as
[34:54] bob's been talking about the attachment
[34:56] perfect man everything comes in threes
[34:58] three stages of this three polls three
[35:01] the three that everybody got that so
[35:04] we're staying in the three so in the
[35:05] mind of god this is what's happening so
[35:08] watch this is before time this is a
[35:10] prophet
[35:12] called paul that's picking up the mind
[35:14] of god before the foundation of the
[35:16] world
[35:17] because watch i'm going to read it
[35:19] blessed be the god and father of my lord
[35:21] jesus christ who has blessed now look
[35:23] i everywhere god
[35:26] god wrote this
[35:28] paul wrote it but we know god wrote it
[35:29] look it's us and we and us and we look
[35:32] at all these different things that that
[35:34] we see that god has given us
[35:36] in this end time but i want you to look
[35:38] at the predict when i say predestinated
[35:40] by to adoption this is the reason
[35:42] because watch blessed be the god and
[35:44] father of our lord jesus christ who is
[35:46] blessed every time you see that red
[35:48] we'll just pronounce it with me blessed
[35:51] one more time blessed
[35:53] that's pretty good with all spiritual
[35:55] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[35:57] now brother brown said that was a
[35:59] believer's position are we not trying to
[36:00] find our position
[36:02] all right you got to find out you're
[36:03] born again first
[36:05] once you find out you're born again
[36:06] first then you can start growing in god
[36:10] some of us are just growing physically
[36:12] but i want to grow up in god
[36:14] amen
[36:15] so this remember this is in heaven
[36:17] according as he has chosen us in him
[36:18] when
[36:21] us and him before
[36:24] i don't have to stop at that us you just
[36:26] say us when i say that okay that makes
[36:28] it really class participation according
[36:30] to he has chosen
[36:31] in him before the foundation of the
[36:33] world that
[36:34] that was weak that
[36:37] should be holy keep you awake
[36:41] we should be holy and without blame
[36:42] before him in love now look that's what
[36:44] god said about you today we sit here
[36:46] today we are not the holiest people in
[36:48] the world
[36:49] outside man
[36:51] middle man memory reason conscious
[36:53] affection but that's not what god saw
[36:56] that's not what god saw
[36:58] god saw this thing already done but then
[37:00] remember we've got to come down here
[37:02] according as he has chosen
[37:04] then you're getting it in him before the
[37:06] foundation of the world
[37:07] that
[37:09] we should be holy and without blame
[37:10] before him in love look having
[37:13] predestinated
[37:15] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[37:17] christ to himself according to the good
[37:19] pleasure of his will what brother brown
[37:20] say his will was his will is his word
[37:23] today you are listening to the reading
[37:25] of the will of a testator that died to
[37:28] give you something
[37:32] but remember our inheritance was before
[37:34] the foundation of the world
[37:36] everybody okay with that
[37:39] jesus didn't come to bring us an
[37:40] inheritance
[37:43] i'm telling you where your inheritance
[37:45] was at
[37:46] having predestinated
[37:48] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[37:50] christ to himself according to the good
[37:51] pleasure of his will which is will is
[37:53] his word
[37:54] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[37:56] wherein he hath made
[37:58] us accepted
[38:01] in the beloved
[38:04] that's jesus christ
[38:07] this is my beloved son and who i am
[38:09] pleased to dwell
[38:11] that's your new birth that's what we're
[38:13] talking about today we're talking about
[38:14] the new birth we're going to get to it
[38:16] just a bit what we were talking about
[38:17] this yesterday i mean last sunday so now
[38:20] look but we've got to come down here
[38:22] listen redemption
[38:24] i want you to listen to what i'm saying
[38:26] redemption
[38:27] was thought of in heaven
[38:32] the plan of redemption was in the mind
[38:33] of god before the foundation of the
[38:34] world
[38:36] but it had to unfold in its natural part
[38:39] because revelations
[38:40] 13 8 i believe it says that the lamb was
[38:43] slain before the foundation of the world
[38:46] before the foundation of the world
[38:49] but
[38:51] he had to literally come down here
[38:54] and die on the cross
[38:56] because redemption in his finish point
[38:59] finishes down here
[39:01] redemption doesn't finish in heaven
[39:02] redemption finishes down here in its
[39:04] natural form you we have to play out
[39:07] this act
[39:08] that was in the mind of god before the
[39:10] foundation of the world everybody okay
[39:12] so now here we are on earth verse seven
[39:16] in whom
[39:18] that was weak in whom
[39:20] have redemption
[39:23] through his blood
[39:25] now remember he died in the mind of god
[39:27] two thousand years i mean
[39:28] 25 million billion years ago
[39:31] but 2 000 years ago he literally did
[39:33] this
[39:34] and that's what we believe in
[39:36] listen
[39:37] i can't listen i can take the mind of
[39:40] god and believed that that was in the
[39:42] mind of god but
[39:44] he had to do it 2000 years ago so i can
[39:46] see it here on earth
[39:47] so i can believe that that man did
[39:50] literally shed his blood literally hang
[39:53] on a cross for me and you amen
[39:56] and who most in whom
[39:58] have redemption through his blood the
[40:00] forgiveness of sins
[40:02] plural sins
[40:04] according to the riches of his grace
[40:07] wherein he has abounded toward
[40:10] in all wisdom and prudence
[40:12] having made known unto
[40:15] the mystery of his will
[40:17] having made known to us
[40:19] not the world
[40:22] the mystery of his will and the mystery
[40:25] of his will is what brother ram says to
[40:27] adopt us
[40:28] okay so that's the mystery of the that's
[40:30] the whole mystery that you come down
[40:32] through time and even paul and all the
[40:34] different ones they speak of adoption
[40:36] they give you types and shadows but it's
[40:38] only supposed to happen in the end time
[40:41] it's on because we did have a major
[40:44] prophet that brought the word back
[40:46] listen god cannot work through false
[40:50] doctrine
[40:53] that's the key
[40:55] it's like brother bob was talking one
[40:57] word eve
[40:58] one
[40:59] word
[41:01] put every hospital that's right on a
[41:04] corner
[41:05] put every cemetery out in the field
[41:08] one word
[41:09] so don't you think one word's not gonna
[41:12] be important
[41:14] to get us out of here so god had to send
[41:16] us a word prophet he had to send a major
[41:18] prophet but well now we have that major
[41:20] prophet's message
[41:22] and the anointing to go with it and then
[41:24] that makes me a new prophet
[41:28] brother brown said we are prophetic
[41:29] people
[41:31] is that what he said
[41:32] if we're prophetic people we ought to be
[41:34] able to see like he saw you say oh
[41:36] brother branham was the eagle and he
[41:38] sure he was he was the one that came to
[41:40] maturity first he was the one that went
[41:41] up higher to look and see he was the one
[41:44] that looked over the fence but what did
[41:46] he do he come back and told us
[41:48] what was over the fence
[41:50] amen so now we have to take and go okay
[41:53] we know what's over the fence we know
[41:54] the revelation of what's going on so on
[41:57] earth it's where our redemption is but
[41:59] let watch
[42:00] have it made no unto
[42:02] the mystery of that was weak
[42:05] the mystery of his will according to the
[42:07] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[42:09] himself
[42:11] pre-determined
[42:13] destiny
[42:15] because he saw it in his mind
[42:20] and brother branham stood one day and
[42:22] said let's go back into the back part of
[42:24] god's mind
[42:26] he said let's go back there he didn't
[42:28] say i'm just going back there he said
[42:30] let's go back in the back part of god
[42:32] mind god's mind and see this great
[42:34] mystery this great purpose of why we're
[42:36] here
[42:37] and he preached christ is the mystery of
[42:39] god revealed
[42:40] one of the greatest one sermons he ever
[42:42] preached in his life amen having made
[42:45] known unto
[42:47] the mystery of his will according to his
[42:48] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[42:50] himself
[42:51] look
[42:52] that in the dispensation
[42:54] of the fullness of times
[42:57] in other words the past 2 000 years
[42:59] we've got dispensation of every church
[43:01] age all the way up to today this
[43:03] dispensation is
[43:05] for the adoption of children
[43:08] and to grow up in god
[43:11] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[43:13] of times he might gather together in one
[43:16] all things in christ both which are in
[43:18] heaven and which on earth even in him
[43:21] and whom also
[43:24] have obtained an inheritance
[43:27] oh no brother way we were just this
[43:29] great
[43:30] uh from the foundation i mean from the
[43:31] time we were born we were just this seed
[43:34] and we were just this eternal person and
[43:36] we had this eternal life
[43:38] baloney the things i did when i was
[43:41] growing up god didn't have nothing to do
[43:43] with that
[43:44] amen
[43:46] god will not dwell in an unclean vessel
[43:48] but now in the mind of god
[43:51] as we read that scripture before the
[43:52] foundation of the world verse 1 through
[43:55] 6
[43:56] god saw that we would want it so he gave
[43:58] it to us
[43:59] amen had it waiting on us
[44:03] so yes there was an eternal seed
[44:05] but you weren't born with it
[44:08] you had to obtain it
[44:10] you had to fight for it
[44:15] to me that's so easy
[44:18] so easy
[44:20] to understand if you'll if you'll
[44:22] separate it
[44:23] to where you've we we've got a message
[44:25] that is so prophetic that it takes the
[44:27] mind of god but it takes the mind of god
[44:29] and brings it down so that individuals
[44:31] can understand it that just common
[44:33] people can understand but see the great
[44:35] minds of the world and the great minds
[44:37] of sometimes in the message
[44:40] overlook those simple things
[44:44] and listen i'm telling one word
[44:48] we're not we don't get a uh we get a
[44:50] grace card but we don't get what they
[44:52] all say in golf they call it a mulligan
[44:54] you get one stroke that you don't have
[44:55] to deal with well we don't do that
[44:58] none of the bride is going to take a
[44:59] body change i'll promise you you don't
[45:00] get one
[45:01] we've got to take a body change
[45:03] according to this next one we're going
[45:05] to read down here when we get to it
[45:07] am i okay
[45:08] so ephesians 1 1 through 6 is in god in
[45:12] the mind of god before time
[45:15] before the foundation of the world
[45:16] you've got to get into be the faithful
[45:18] in christ jesus so we got to come to
[45:20] redemption on earth and we've got to
[45:22] come to full redemption
[45:24] the fullness of times not just part
[45:27] luther had part wesley had part but you
[45:29] and i are going to have to bring it all
[45:30] together in the fullness of this time
[45:33] and we're gonna have to take a body
[45:34] chain somebody will
[45:36] it won't be a billion people
[45:39] it'll only take one
[45:41] that's right it'll only take one i'm
[45:44] praying there's more but it'll only take
[45:46] one person one jesus stood and brought
[45:48] lazarus out of the grave and brother
[45:49] brown said if he hadn't called lazarus
[45:51] by name he said the whole all the old
[45:53] testament people would have resurrected
[45:55] how powerful is that
[45:59] in whom also
[46:02] y'all sleep already
[46:06] and him also
[46:08] that's better obtained an inheritance
[46:10] look being predestinated according to
[46:13] the purpose of him who worketh all
[46:15] things after what the counsel of his
[46:18] will or his word
[46:20] amen he cannot he listen this bible sure
[46:24] was written before the foundational
[46:25] world but it had to be unfolded down
[46:26] here amen there had to be an elijah
[46:29] there had to be an isaiah there had to
[46:31] be an abraham they had to be a
[46:33] a literal person
[46:35] because if we're coming to the
[46:37] revelation of the son of man i thought
[46:39] that was god in human flesh
[46:41] that wasn't god in spirit form
[46:43] that was god in humans yes
[46:46] having the preeminence
[46:49] that's right
[46:50] been dealing on that a little bit this
[46:52] this week you talk about preeminence now
[46:54] you've got to remember
[46:56] we have a life to live
[46:59] man when we first come in the message
[47:01] they were
[47:03] you know there was doctrine flying
[47:04] everywhere but boy there was there were
[47:06] some really
[47:07] some people that were really i mean they
[47:09] were like zombies
[47:10] they didn't want to do you know
[47:12] and kick the tv out we know all that
[47:15] but the preeminence
[47:17] has got to start from any side
[47:19] it can't be a do and a don't
[47:23] it's got to come from inside that's why
[47:25] we got to look at the inside teacher
[47:27] that's why we got to have teachers and
[47:29] tutors and governors to teach us because
[47:31] listen folks we're all contrary to god
[47:35] you were born contrary to god so don't
[47:38] talk to me about being special
[47:41] god's not a respecter of persons
[47:44] we were all born dead
[47:46] lost
[47:48] but we had predestination
[47:51] we had the foreknowledge of god to know
[47:52] that we would want it that's right amen
[47:58] that we would want it
[48:00] and want nothing else but that
[48:03] and the preeminence would be that we put
[48:05] god first in everything we do
[48:07] not that we walk around we have to pray
[48:09] with our eyes closed the bible says pray
[48:11] without ceasing you can pray without
[48:13] ceasing with your eyes open
[48:15] amen
[48:16] the bible says jesus looked up in heaven
[48:18] and prayed he was looking all right so
[48:20] well you know we think we have to close
[48:22] our eyes but we don't have to close our
[48:24] eyes to pray we can be in a constant
[48:26] state
[48:28] of preeminence
[48:31] if we'll just listen to what he has to
[48:32] say
[48:34] and we've got life to live folks we've
[48:36] got jobs to do we've got all this other
[48:38] stuff but are we listening to what god
[48:41] tells us
[48:45] you watch
[48:47] bob meddled wednesday night i'm gonna
[48:48] meddle a little bit this morning
[48:50] you watch there's two things that you
[48:52] watch
[48:54] if somebody don't pay their time
[48:57] they struggle with money all the time
[49:03] don't think you can hide
[49:06] amen
[49:08] and number two you watch people when
[49:10] they start having problems they quit
[49:11] coming to church
[49:13] the very thing you're not supposed to do
[49:16] you're giving preeminence to somebody
[49:18] else
[49:19] this is where you need to be
[49:22] fight your way to church
[49:24] you'll get something
[49:26] [Applause]
[49:28] find your way
[49:30] don't come to me with problems and
[49:32] uh
[49:34] something on facebook the other day that
[49:35] was talking about
[49:36] um
[49:38] something about you know well said i'm
[49:40] not getting fed
[49:41] it's all about spiritually and the
[49:44] commentator said well you ought to come
[49:46] to where you eat
[49:48] in other words he was saying if you come
[49:50] to church you get fed
[49:52] if you stay away i mean if you say well
[49:54] i'm malnourished but there's gold and
[49:56] corral sitting in your parking lane
[49:59] your attack your house is attached to
[50:00] the golden corral and you're starving to
[50:01] death
[50:04] brother dale likes golden corral so do i
[50:08] that's where you get your food well
[50:09] guess where you get your food amen
[50:13] and it's not just press play
[50:16] you need an atmosphere
[50:19] you need a place that people get
[50:20] together
[50:21] sheep have to get together because we're
[50:23] hurt animals
[50:24] amen and we're stronger together what
[50:26] does what is the first thing that a lion
[50:30] or a wolf or a fox anything even
[50:32] something small what's the first thing
[50:34] they do they cut them away from the herd
[50:37] they find one they can't get 20 people
[50:39] at one time
[50:40] or 20 animals sorry at one time so he'll
[50:43] pick one
[50:46] he'll pick that one and don't go to
[50:47] church much and don't pay their time but
[50:48] don't read their bible but don't pray
[50:55] so
[50:56] do the vice versa
[50:58] you know that's a quote
[51:00] brother brown said if you're stingy give
[51:02] stuff away
[51:03] he said just do the vice versa he said
[51:05] if you're having a problem and if you
[51:07] have a problem with this just don't do
[51:08] it
[51:09] it's pretty simple but it it's really
[51:11] profound i guess to get people to get to
[51:13] church but
[51:15] anyway that we
[51:17] that we should be to the praise of his
[51:19] glory first trusted in christ in whom
[51:23] oh you can say we because that ye is we
[51:25] and whom
[51:27] also trusted look after
[51:32] did you trust god when he was in the
[51:34] world
[51:35] no you trusted your own ability
[51:41] you didn't pray about stuff when you was
[51:42] out in the world
[51:44] no you didn't i thank you no you didn't
[51:46] just plain that's your sister would say
[51:48] the same thing
[51:50] no you wouldn't no you didn't you didn't
[51:52] ask god about the things you did when
[51:53] you was a sinner
[51:55] no right but after that you heard the
[51:58] word of truth you had to hear the word
[52:00] you didn't just come up and say i'm just
[52:02] in the message
[52:05] i had this seed down inside of me and
[52:07] boy just i just feel it now well you
[52:10] feel it all right
[52:12] but after you heard the word of truth
[52:15] listen you have to hear the word to be
[52:17] justified you have to hear the word to
[52:20] be sanctified and you have to hear the
[52:22] word of god to receive the baptism of
[52:24] the holy ghost you cannot receive it
[52:27] just sitting under a tree and not heard
[52:29] of god ever that's right because what
[52:31] are you going to connect to
[52:32] what are you going to repent to who are
[52:33] you going to repent too if you don't
[52:34] know how to repent of god
[52:37] godly sorrow leads you to repentance
[52:39] what's godly sorrow you coming to church
[52:41] are you getting under conviction
[52:42] somebody telling you about the lord
[52:45] amen
[52:46] that all right
[52:48] in whom
[52:50] we also trusted after that
[52:54] heard the word of truth so you got to
[52:56] hear truth
[52:58] the gospel of
[53:00] your salvation
[53:02] and whom after look in whom also after
[53:05] that
[53:07] believed
[53:10] we're sealed with that holy spirit of
[53:12] promise
[53:12] [Applause]
[53:13] there's your journey that's what we're
[53:15] going to look at we're going to look at
[53:16] about going across
[53:18] we're
[53:19] and we'll not get to it today because
[53:20] we're going to try to keep it a little
[53:22] bit short but we're going to get into
[53:24] joshua and then when they got
[53:27] ready to go into the promised land
[53:30] listen they went through the
[53:32] wilderness of sin why do you think they
[53:35] called it the wilderness of sin
[53:36] because they were coming under
[53:37] sanctification what was god doing he was
[53:39] trying to get away he was trying to get
[53:41] the trash out
[53:43] all this demons you read it or somebody
[53:44] ready where brother brown was talking
[53:46] about their everyone dead those people
[53:48] those old fighters those old people that
[53:50] came out of egypt had to die
[53:53] because god couldn't work them they were
[53:55] always murmuring always complaining
[53:58] i mean my heavens what a social program
[54:02] he fed them three meals a day
[54:04] clothed their
[54:06] their clothes didn't wear out
[54:08] what miracles
[54:10] couldn't a man look at his kid and say
[54:12] that baby's got on the same clothes and
[54:14] he's 14 years old that kind of baby got
[54:16] on the same clothes it did when it was a
[54:18] baby
[54:20] did not the bible said their clothes did
[54:22] not wear out nor their sandals and they
[54:25] walked for 40 years
[54:28] in the same shoes walmart would be out
[54:30] of business
[54:32] if that happened this time but you know
[54:34] what that's what we're heading back to
[54:35] you don't think in eternity we're going
[54:37] to have to trade our shoes
[54:39] sorry rich where's richard sorry richard
[54:41] no goodwill
[54:42] no good will in heaven
[54:44] sorry about that richard loves go to
[54:45] goodwill
[54:46] and get them secondhand things
[54:48] that's all right there's nothing wrong
[54:50] with that
[54:51] all right and who
[54:53] ye also trusted after that you heard the
[54:55] word of truth the gospel of your
[54:57] salvation look how personal this whole
[55:00] ephesians 1 is he's trying to get you to
[55:02] see that god's working through you and
[55:04] with you all right
[55:06] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[55:09] promise now watch
[55:11] now we're going to the future which
[55:13] would be romans 8 23 we're going to get
[55:15] to eventually verse 14 says which is the
[55:17] earnest of our inheritance now
[55:19] an earnest that's right here
[55:22] this is the earnest today you're sitting
[55:25] in the earnest of your inheritance if
[55:27] you're born again
[55:29] even if you're not born again you're
[55:31] going to get an inheritance
[55:33] it ain't going to be good
[55:34] but you're going to get one
[55:36] which is the earnest of
[55:40] our inheritance
[55:42] until the redemption of the purchased
[55:43] possession until the praise of his glory
[55:45] what is the purchase possession your
[55:48] body change
[55:49] is to purchase possession
[55:51] that's why some have to go by the grave
[55:53] but guess what they're going to pick up
[55:54] that body they were living in
[55:56] god's going to change that body change
[55:58] the atoms make it 20 years old it's
[56:00] going to have to respond to what's in
[56:03] that curtain of time
[56:05] because what's inside of you i'm telling
[56:07] you it's more powerful than what's on
[56:09] the outside of you
[56:14] because when they come back up they're
[56:15] not going to brother robert tatum's not
[56:17] going to come back up in the 80
[56:18] something year old body
[56:19] no
[56:20] but when he got born again he got a 20
[56:22] year old body his theophany inside of
[56:25] him inside of you today
[56:30] listen
[56:32] have you ever thought about this i was
[56:33] thinking about this yesterday
[56:36] i'm talking about the new birth if you
[56:38] really realize what happens
[56:40] at the new birth
[56:43] what god's done
[56:45] to get you where you're at
[56:48] have you ever thought about it sit down
[56:50] think about it
[56:51] if you're not born again you don't have
[56:52] a lot to think about
[56:54] except getting born again
[56:56] so listen if you decide you're not born
[56:57] again
[56:58] that's a good point
[57:00] the ones that think they're born again
[57:02] the ones in trouble that are not
[57:04] but if you ever just sit and realize
[57:05] that look when you were in the world
[57:08] and you did the things of the world
[57:10] the bible said the love of the father
[57:12] was not in you
[57:14] that bear okay with that
[57:16] even if you sit in a messy church for 30
[57:19] years and didn't do all the things of
[57:20] the world
[57:22] you were still worley
[57:25] you always want to sneak around and do
[57:26] this or sneak around and do am i hitting
[57:28] something
[57:28] sneak around do this and sneak around
[57:30] and do that
[57:32] remember them them little bob blacks
[57:34] kids they just so precious
[57:38] devils that's the box of that's right
[57:41] [Laughter]
[57:43] i'm just joking
[57:45] breathe
[57:46] breathe zoe breathe
[57:49] can't embarrass her boys your face gets
[57:51] red
[57:52] but we were we were born in a sin shape
[57:54] and iniquity we were bound on our way to
[57:57] hell
[57:58] and our soul was black it was the devil
[58:02] it was the nature of this world the
[58:04] nature of the demons of this world you
[58:07] see what the demons are doing now don't
[58:08] you
[58:09] my lord they're in everything
[58:12] you can't really hardly have a lot of
[58:14] preeminence minds you you see this
[58:16] preeminent uh billboard now they got
[58:19] them to change
[58:23] they change from one naked woman to
[58:24] another one
[58:25] you can't turn your head because you see
[58:27] another one
[58:28] but god knew we would make it in this
[58:31] age so don't make it's not an excuse
[58:34] but think what god did at your new birth
[58:36] he took that soul
[58:38] now i want you to understand something
[58:40] what is making you think today what is
[58:43] making me move my hand today is my soul
[58:48] it is not my body
[58:52] something's having to tell that body to
[58:54] move
[58:55] there is a firing mechanism or some sort
[58:58] of whatever you want to call it
[58:59] electrical charge
[59:01] that's going on in you right now be a
[59:03] little bit unplugged
[59:05] but um
[59:06] plug it back in
[59:08] maybe that's what we need to get
[59:11] this little plug in we plug it back in
[59:15] but that fire mechanism that is a soul
[59:18] that's a life
[59:20] that's a person
[59:22] this help that's making you do it's even
[59:24] making you think thoughts that you're
[59:25] thinking now we know that memory reason
[59:27] conscious affects an imagination
[59:28] remember we're not born again in that
[59:31] that realm
[59:32] all right because of the bad thoughts
[59:34] that we have and we still have problems
[59:35] we still got to go up the statue of
[59:36] perfect man but inside your soul if
[59:38] you're born again today
[59:40] god
[59:43] not an angel
[59:45] god himself resides in your soul
[59:50] god himself
[59:52] not a second person not a third person
[59:55] not an angel
[59:57] god
[59:58] the creator
[1:00:01] resides
[1:00:03] in your soul
[1:00:06] that's what you need after you heard the
[1:00:07] word of god the gospel of your salvation
[1:00:10] after you heard that
[1:00:12] you didn't know anything about it until
[1:00:13] you heard it
[1:00:15] how did you get how did you come under
[1:00:16] conviction well god he he just he just
[1:00:19] no you were sitting somewhere listening
[1:00:23] or you were sitting somewhere listening
[1:00:24] to what a preacher said six months ago
[1:00:27] but something comes to you of what you
[1:00:29] heard
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:32] isn't that how you had you did your bad
[1:00:34] stuff at out in the world
[1:00:38] you leaned to what you heard you leaned
[1:00:40] to what you saw
[1:00:42] but now
[1:00:43] we lean to what god inside of us is and
[1:00:46] what the word is but listen to get in
[1:00:49] your soul he had to do a work
[1:00:52] he had to do something
[1:00:54] it's not just automatic that's what i
[1:00:56] say about
[1:00:57] and god forbid
[1:01:00] it is easy
[1:01:01] but it's not that easy
[1:01:03] to just say well i believe the message
[1:01:04] so i reckon that that seed just popped
[1:01:06] to life and
[1:01:09] no you it says after
[1:01:11] after you heard the word of truth after
[1:01:14] you come to this new birth
[1:01:16] god starts dealing with you
[1:01:18] why because before that you were
[1:01:20] contrary to god
[1:01:21] you were as black as night as the song
[1:01:23] says yours my soul was as black as night
[1:01:28] but darkness has taken flight what
[1:01:31] that had to go out of you
[1:01:33] as in the book of luke says the unclean
[1:01:35] spirit goes out of a man that's in
[1:01:37] sanctification
[1:01:38] that's not it's a new birth
[1:01:42] because remember
[1:01:44] the children of israel will get to this
[1:01:45] afternoon the children of israel were
[1:01:47] the children of israel
[1:01:49] but they had to take a journey and their
[1:01:52] journey was not in the type of the holy
[1:01:54] ghost
[1:01:56] hello
[1:01:58] their wilderness journey was
[1:02:00] sanctification
[1:02:02] not in the promised land
[1:02:05] amen justification was they came out of
[1:02:08] egypt
[1:02:09] but they had a mixed multitude with them
[1:02:10] they had the unbelievers they had the
[1:02:12] real believers they had some that wasn't
[1:02:14] even born yet
[1:02:16] that were believers later on we'll get
[1:02:18] to it this afternoon but then the
[1:02:20] wilderness of sin god had to start
[1:02:22] shedding
[1:02:23] the unbelievers
[1:02:25] that's at your sanctification that's not
[1:02:27] within your birth
[1:02:28] do not get caught in the wilderness of
[1:02:30] sin
[1:02:32] and you keep going satan loves for you
[1:02:34] to take that death walk
[1:02:37] indian death walk round and round and
[1:02:39] round in the same they went 40 years
[1:02:43] and they should have been in the
[1:02:44] promised land in about three days
[1:02:49] don't you think they went to the same
[1:02:51] place
[1:02:52] 40 times
[1:02:54] at least
[1:02:55] and 2 million people and cows and
[1:02:57] donkeys and everything else well they
[1:02:59] strung out probably five miles
[1:03:02] just the people and the animals and the
[1:03:04] carts and the and the tents and all that
[1:03:06] other stuff that they had
[1:03:08] and they walked around just like me and
[1:03:10] you
[1:03:11] the devil puts on death mark but you
[1:03:13] know what one day somebody stood up and
[1:03:14] said hey
[1:03:16] we ain't going that way anymore
[1:03:19] joshua and caleb said no we're we're not
[1:03:20] going we're going that way
[1:03:22] we're going to go to that mountain jake
[1:03:25] i mean
[1:03:26] caleb said give me my mountain
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:31] we'll get to that this afternoon
[1:03:33] but in the future which is the earnest
[1:03:35] of our inheritance
[1:03:37] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:03:38] possession until the praise was glory
[1:03:40] and then when we get to romans 8
[1:03:43] verse 23
[1:03:46] you've got to come to adoption first
[1:03:49] you got to come to your birth
[1:03:51] you got to have your journey we're
[1:03:52] talking about positioning placing people
[1:03:54] come to adoption where your name is as
[1:03:56] good on the checkbook as god's is
[1:04:01] it is now potentially
[1:04:04] but he's not going to give you the
[1:04:05] checkbook
[1:04:08] and you're not ready for it
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] we're not going to give
[1:04:13] the keys to the car
[1:04:14] to morty
[1:04:15] as we did the other day brother john's
[1:04:17] still sweating over there
[1:04:20] but we're not going to give the keys to
[1:04:21] the car to a kid
[1:04:23] and god knows more than we do about when
[1:04:25] we're ready to get it
[1:04:26] but he knew somebody would be ready to
[1:04:29] get it
[1:04:31] because he had the keys
[1:04:33] and the car ready
[1:04:35] hey man he just wants us to get in there
[1:04:37] and drive it but you know what driving
[1:04:39] in the right way because power without
[1:04:41] character satanic i see that more than
[1:04:42] ever and ever
[1:04:46] power without character will make you do
[1:04:47] things that you i mean even at the even
[1:04:50] at new birth
[1:04:52] ungodly temper
[1:04:57] compromise on the word of god as bob was
[1:04:58] talking about wednesday night there's no
[1:05:00] room for compromising
[1:05:03] none
[1:05:05] and if it separates us i was talking to
[1:05:07] brother rush just a few minutes ago he
[1:05:08] was talking about
[1:05:10] if the son of man if we're supposed to
[1:05:12] have the son of man ministry which i've
[1:05:13] been preaching for 20 something sermons
[1:05:16] it's going to make you different
[1:05:19] it's going to make the world hate you
[1:05:24] and they're going to actually crucify us
[1:05:27] not on a cross like jesus he already
[1:05:29] done that we don't have to go there
[1:05:30] anymore but spiritually he's crucified
[1:05:32] why did brother brown stand up one day
[1:05:33] and sigh and die this generation for the
[1:05:36] second crucifixion of jesus christ they
[1:05:38] didn't put him on a cross physically
[1:05:40] spiritually they put him on a cross
[1:05:43] they made his they made his first
[1:05:46] listen to me
[1:05:47] they made his first crucifixion of not a
[1:05:49] fact
[1:05:51] we don't believe that because of our
[1:05:52] tradition
[1:05:54] this is what we believe
[1:05:56] so they they put him spiritually back on
[1:05:58] the cross
[1:06:01] are we doing the same thing
[1:06:03] that's my question to you
[1:06:04] are we killing him again by our
[1:06:06] doctrines by our habits our ways of
[1:06:08] things that we do that we're not
[1:06:09] supposed to be doing
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] come on people
[1:06:15] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:06:16] what's the earnest the down payment your
[1:06:18] new birth as i was saying a minute ago
[1:06:21] brother brown talks about vulcanizing
[1:06:24] everybody understand that brother brown
[1:06:25] one time he talks about vulcanized
[1:06:27] everybody know what vulcanizing is
[1:06:29] not the young kids they love all them
[1:06:31] looked up when i say that they go
[1:06:35] used to
[1:06:38] used to there was a tube inside of your
[1:06:40] tire
[1:06:41] everybody
[1:06:42] tire t-i-r-e in you on your car even on
[1:06:45] your bicycle and your four-wheeler and
[1:06:47] all that other stuff you got it
[1:06:49] right everybody okay
[1:06:52] in the polaris and all that they're not
[1:06:53] anymore they they're usually tubeless
[1:06:55] now but when you had a tube and it got a
[1:06:59] hole in it
[1:07:01] you didn't throw the see that's why
[1:07:03] we're so disposable now we just throw
[1:07:05] the tire away and just have to buy a new
[1:07:07] tire
[1:07:08] i don't know do they sell even sell
[1:07:11] do they still sell them tubes you have
[1:07:14] to probably probably find them because
[1:07:15] they used to they were everywhere i mean
[1:07:18] convenience stores everybody sold tubes
[1:07:20] because everybody needed them
[1:07:22] but you take that tube and it's made out
[1:07:23] of what
[1:07:25] rubber
[1:07:26] all right then they sell you a patch
[1:07:29] that's made out of
[1:07:31] rubber
[1:07:32] then they give you
[1:07:34] some glue
[1:07:36] and to make it really stick
[1:07:39] you light it
[1:07:41] and it burns
[1:07:42] the glue gets it really hot
[1:07:45] and then you take that patch which is
[1:07:47] rubber
[1:07:48] and the tube which is rubber and you
[1:07:53] put them together and what happens it
[1:07:55] vulcanizes in other words it melts into
[1:07:57] the
[1:08:00] rubber
[1:08:01] and it makes it one
[1:08:03] makes it actually now stronger because
[1:08:05] it's double layer stronger than it was
[1:08:07] when it first started
[1:08:08] that's the way god did us it's a new
[1:08:10] birth we had a hole in ourself it was
[1:08:12] called the devil
[1:08:13] we had a hole in our tube
[1:08:16] now predestinated in the mind of god
[1:08:18] yeah god has to give everybody a soul
[1:08:21] yes everybody with me today
[1:08:23] god gives you a soul now you it's you
[1:08:26] what determines what to do what you're
[1:08:28] going to do with it
[1:08:30] adolf hitler had a soul
[1:08:33] but he left it black
[1:08:35] he didn't ask for any kind of
[1:08:36] forgiveness
[1:08:38] everybody okay with this
[1:08:40] but you one day when you got down on
[1:08:42] your knees you said god i don't want to
[1:08:44] live this way anymore i got too many
[1:08:46] holes in my tire
[1:08:50] i put air in it goes
[1:08:53] it goes flat
[1:08:55] i'm tired of the way i'm living
[1:08:57] aaron was probably
[1:08:59] amber probably wished he had a patch
[1:09:01] when he's out there on the road
[1:09:03] i hate about listen i pray for people
[1:09:05] when they have um tire trouble
[1:09:10] because i don't like that
[1:09:12] i have to change all that on the side of
[1:09:14] the road and somebody knock you down and
[1:09:15] kill you
[1:09:17] so you've got a saw
[1:09:19] but it's black
[1:09:21] but it's a soul
[1:09:23] it's something god can work with
[1:09:25] it's rubber
[1:09:27] but it's got a hole in it
[1:09:30] and you've and you've you've tried
[1:09:32] because see you might want to stick a
[1:09:34] piece of wood in it
[1:09:36] you might want to take a band-aid
[1:09:39] like one time before a long time ago
[1:09:41] when we had bicycles we used to try to
[1:09:42] take we didn't have duct tape back then
[1:09:44] but we had the black electrical tape you
[1:09:47] take that electrical tape and you try
[1:09:48] your best to get that hole to close up
[1:09:51] but when you say man this is good and
[1:09:52] then you put put you put the pressure to
[1:09:54] it guess what
[1:09:59] david
[1:10:03] but you had to find something
[1:10:06] that had a soul also
[1:10:09] that could fix you
[1:10:11] that's why the bible tells we need to be
[1:10:15] we're going to be
[1:10:16] filled with the holy ghost and fire
[1:10:20] and fire
[1:10:23] the patch came
[1:10:25] the patch came down and gave his life
[1:10:27] for you
[1:10:28] so that you could ask him
[1:10:30] to fill your hole
[1:10:32] to fill your cup
[1:10:35] but it took rubber
[1:10:37] it took a man with an eternal soul
[1:10:40] to give you eternal life
[1:10:42] that's why it had to be jesus christ
[1:10:44] that's why he had to be almighty god
[1:10:46] that's why he wasn't a second person to
[1:10:47] a trinity that's why he wasn't just a
[1:10:49] mere human
[1:10:50] even though he was a human but inside of
[1:10:53] him
[1:10:55] was rubber
[1:10:59] and by the fire of the holy ghost
[1:11:02] he burnt that old you out
[1:11:04] killed it
[1:11:06] if you let him
[1:11:08] killed it not divorced it we talked
[1:11:10] about that before
[1:11:13] you sisters you can't marry if you have
[1:11:14] a living husband guess what i'm not
[1:11:18] talking about just you women i'm talking
[1:11:19] about us
[1:11:22] the bride of jesus christ can't have 12
[1:11:24] living
[1:11:24] husbands right
[1:11:26] he's got to be what
[1:11:28] dead
[1:11:30] d-e-a-d dead and once he's dead you're
[1:11:33] free to marry
[1:11:35] you're free to vulcanize
[1:11:37] and let the holy ghost in fire put that
[1:11:40] patch on and listen never ever ever will
[1:11:44] he get a hole in it again
[1:11:46] never will it get a hole in it because
[1:11:48] look that's our inheritance
[1:11:54] but that's just your earnest
[1:11:59] that's the down payment
[1:12:02] that's not the full possession
[1:12:04] the full possession
[1:12:06] is that we
[1:12:10] are going to become
[1:12:12] god on the outside
[1:12:14] not just god on the inside
[1:12:16] we're going to become god on the outside
[1:12:20] and that potential is lying here today
[1:12:23] in each and every one of us look which
[1:12:25] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[1:12:28] the redemption of the purchased
[1:12:30] possession
[1:12:31] unto the praise of his glory
[1:12:36] now let's read them
[1:12:38] quoting in the token i hope you
[1:12:40] understood that look in your bibles
[1:12:42] that's why i brought my old bible
[1:12:43] because i got notes written everywhere
[1:12:46] but um
[1:12:47] see before the foundation of the world
[1:12:49] when god saw all this
[1:12:50] as brother brown said he took a picture
[1:12:52] of you
[1:12:53] when you were 20 years old
[1:12:59] and at your new birth
[1:13:02] you were changed i thought you were a
[1:13:04] new creation
[1:13:07] he recreated you
[1:13:09] and now that soul inside of you is not
[1:13:12] 60 years old
[1:13:14] 70 years old
[1:13:16] 40 years old
[1:13:18] it's 20 years old
[1:13:20] because if it's eternal it can't be old
[1:13:23] i thought i just said you got eternal
[1:13:25] life at your new birth
[1:13:26] the eternal's not old
[1:13:30] eternal's young
[1:13:33] that's what you've got in you already
[1:13:36] let it out
[1:13:38] let it out
[1:13:40] and the only way you can let it out is
[1:13:41] you let it out
[1:13:44] because god's not going to do it
[1:13:47] but god took a picture
[1:13:50] and he saw each and every one of us
[1:13:52] before we were even born
[1:13:54] and what is a myth what is the mystery
[1:13:57] this great mystery
[1:13:58] paul said christ in you
[1:14:01] the hope of glory
[1:14:03] christ in you for you to realize what
[1:14:04] you already have in your possession
[1:14:08] but it's just the earnest
[1:14:10] it's the earnest
[1:14:12] the down payment until the purchase
[1:14:15] possession it was a down payment when
[1:14:17] they come out of israel when the
[1:14:18] children of israel came out of egypt
[1:14:20] that was a down payment because they
[1:14:21] hadn't got there yet
[1:14:22] but somebody was going to because there
[1:14:24] was a promise
[1:14:26] there was a promised land
[1:14:28] that they was made a promise
[1:14:30] somebody was going to live in that
[1:14:32] promised land
[1:14:34] now god knew all them people he took
[1:14:36] care of for 40 years fed them
[1:14:40] watered them clothed them
[1:14:43] protected them
[1:14:45] he knew none of them was going to make
[1:14:47] it but two
[1:14:48] joshua and caleb
[1:14:51] that's the only ones that were going to
[1:14:52] make it
[1:14:54] but they were predestinated
[1:14:56] because god saw joshua
[1:14:58] would stand up and say
[1:15:00] we can take that place
[1:15:03] and caleb stood up and he didn't even
[1:15:04] just say that he said
[1:15:06] what are y'all talking about remember he
[1:15:08] kept set up stood up in front of them 10
[1:15:10] and said shut up
[1:15:15] remember that sermon i preached about 20
[1:15:17] years ago on 10 lion preachers
[1:15:20] there was 10 lion preachers they went
[1:15:22] across the promised land they've been in
[1:15:24] the message forever how many 40 years
[1:15:28] they went across and saw the land
[1:15:31] saw that brother brown preached attached
[1:15:33] to a perfect man saw that we're supposed
[1:15:35] to come to adoption saw that we're
[1:15:36] supposed to come to the opening of the
[1:15:37] seven seals
[1:15:38] and you know what the ten said
[1:15:40] we can't do it
[1:15:42] they lied
[1:15:44] they were lying preachers but joshua and
[1:15:46] caleb were not
[1:15:47] they said
[1:15:49] i'm not worried about them giants and
[1:15:50] i'm not worried listen them ten throw
[1:15:52] the circumstances out there buddy
[1:15:54] they're bigger than we are we're like
[1:15:55] grasshoppers we can't take this place
[1:15:58] joshua and caleb wasn't looking at that
[1:16:00] they were looking at a promise
[1:16:02] the promise that somebody was gonna
[1:16:04] cross that jordan river and get in that
[1:16:06] land and not just get in the land but
[1:16:08] possess it
[1:16:11] possess the gates of the enemy
[1:16:13] everybody all right
[1:16:15] let's read this real quick right here
[1:16:19] on the token the token is a sign
[1:16:22] that the purchase has been made and been
[1:16:24] accepted i've read this before but look
[1:16:26] made and been accepted
[1:16:28] we're accepted in the beloved
[1:16:31] who is what jesus christ
[1:16:33] but we have to be born again
[1:16:35] to be accepted
[1:16:37] because the devil he god's not going to
[1:16:39] adopt the devil's kids he's only going
[1:16:40] to adopt his kids because they're only
[1:16:42] ones in his line
[1:16:44] does everybody got that
[1:16:46] full complete obedience puts you in the
[1:16:48] word one you believe it every bit and
[1:16:50] all of it's in you
[1:16:53] not on you not something floating around
[1:16:55] beside of you
[1:16:59] but in you
[1:17:00] and you watch it working
[1:17:02] through you
[1:17:04] wow
[1:17:06] now let's go to the next one the next
[1:17:07] one says we were talking about the
[1:17:08] headstone the brother brown said the
[1:17:09] headstone's yet to come
[1:17:12] now he preached a message
[1:17:14] he preached a headstone message but the
[1:17:16] people were not there to receive it
[1:17:19] they'll be okay with that
[1:17:20] we read it over and over again her
[1:17:21] brother adam said it's not for you it's
[1:17:23] gone from you it's not for you to get
[1:17:25] anyway live a good christian life
[1:17:29] and in other words it'll be told later
[1:17:30] on
[1:17:32] who it's going to be and i believe it
[1:17:33] was me and you
[1:17:35] i believe it was somebody that had the
[1:17:36] right receptor
[1:17:38] that had the right crystal that was cut
[1:17:40] the right way
[1:17:42] amen all right let's go to galatians 4
[1:17:45] 1.
[1:17:48] next one
[1:17:51] now i say that the heir as long as he's
[1:17:53] a child difference nothing from a
[1:17:54] servant though he'd be lord of all but
[1:17:56] is under tutors and governors until the
[1:17:58] time appointed
[1:17:59] of the father we have to be
[1:18:03] taught these things let's go to number
[1:18:04] quote number three real quick and then
[1:18:06] we'll quit and come back this afternoon
[1:18:08] in the adoption series now look
[1:18:09] preaching catches the center brings him
[1:18:11] under condemnation by the word but
[1:18:13] teaching places a man positionally what
[1:18:15] he is now what was joshua type of the
[1:18:18] holy ghost right joshua the man
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:22] now when he got him in the promised land
[1:18:24] they didn't just people fall over
[1:18:26] now we know one thing's for sure and
[1:18:27] i'll read it today a lot of the king
[1:18:29] says we're done you know remember rahab
[1:18:30] said when y'all crossed that river
[1:18:33] well it in other words the air just went
[1:18:36] out of our tube
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:38] but teaching places a man positionally
[1:18:40] what he is and we can never rightly be
[1:18:42] able to have faith
[1:18:45] now we have faith for healing we have
[1:18:47] faith for all these different things
[1:18:48] right
[1:18:49] but we can never rightly be able to have
[1:18:52] faith until positionally we know
[1:18:55] what we are
[1:18:57] we'll get to that a little bit later on
[1:18:59] to know what we are not just that we're
[1:19:01] the bride of jesus christ that's your
[1:19:02] new birth
[1:19:04] that's what should be told you it's in
[1:19:06] your birth there should be something
[1:19:07] inside of you say you're my child now
[1:19:10] and if you'll work with me i'll work
[1:19:11] with you and what a teacher does a
[1:19:13] teacher can only work listen anna all
[1:19:16] the anybody that's teaching it's you got
[1:19:18] to get a response
[1:19:21] you can tell everything you know in the
[1:19:22] book
[1:19:24] lay it out there do it just like they
[1:19:25] told you in college just lay it out
[1:19:26] there but if there's nobody there to
[1:19:28] receive it
[1:19:30] and some kid's going to get it and some
[1:19:32] kids are not going to get it
[1:19:35] if we didn't know they had a flat tire
[1:19:37] i'd say that they didn't change their
[1:19:38] clock
[1:19:40] like some of you other ones didn't
[1:19:44] you wait on that you waited on november
[1:19:45] though
[1:19:47] yeah november when you come to church
[1:19:49] and ain't nobody here
[1:19:50] you'll think the raptures took place
[1:19:54] no you just didn't change it you didn't
[1:19:55] change the clock
[1:19:59] number three that where we're at now all
[1:20:01] right let's go number four
[1:20:05] this set for this afternoon your
[1:20:06] adoption is not your birth we've already
[1:20:09] read that several times your adoption is
[1:20:11] your placing so what we were talking
[1:20:12] about we're going to talk about this
[1:20:14] afternoon
[1:20:16] the promised land
[1:20:17] was not where they wandered
[1:20:19] around
[1:20:21] where where did they wander the children
[1:20:22] of israel they wandered in the
[1:20:24] wilderness
[1:20:25] all right
[1:20:26] at least those 20 and under
[1:20:29] knew who they were because joshua and
[1:20:31] caleb told them who they were they
[1:20:34] listened to the messenger of the hour
[1:20:36] which told them about what we're going
[1:20:38] to what they're going to have to do how
[1:20:39] they're going to walk where they're
[1:20:41] going to be positionally placed and
[1:20:42] we'll get to that this afternoon
[1:20:44] but your adoption is not your birth your
[1:20:46] adoption is your placing so this is
[1:20:47] already in the land keep scrolling when
[1:20:49] you
[1:20:51] were born again john 1 17 i believe when
[1:20:53] you're born of the spirit of god we are
[1:20:55] sons of god but we were predestinated
[1:20:57] see but we were predestinated what to
[1:20:59] adoption
[1:21:01] we were predestinated to grow up yes
[1:21:05] now here's what i'm trying to get you to
[1:21:08] for this sons of the last day that's us
[1:21:11] we were predestinated unto adoption now
[1:21:14] here we are this is what hurts pentecost
[1:21:16] a little bit they say i got born again
[1:21:18] praise the lord god the holy ghost
[1:21:19] that's fine
[1:21:21] you're a child of god that's right but
[1:21:23] yet that ain't what i'm talking about
[1:21:25] wow
[1:21:26] so now he has he has took that
[1:21:29] and he has placed it over here he said
[1:21:30] this is not what i'm talking about
[1:21:33] so i'm not talking about the new birth
[1:21:35] i'm talking about your placing
[1:21:38] adoption is placing
[1:21:40] a son so let's go to read the romans 8
[1:21:44] 14
[1:21:45] real quick
[1:21:49] and we'll skip through this a good bit
[1:21:51] but look for as many that are lit this
[1:21:52] is the first stage of adoption you've
[1:21:54] got to be born again you've got to have
[1:21:55] the birth
[1:21:56] that's what we were talking about the
[1:21:57] holy ghost and fire has got to burn the
[1:21:59] old you out
[1:22:02] and god himself
[1:22:04] not a second person
[1:22:06] like i said not an angel
[1:22:08] god he said oh well god's the angel of
[1:22:11] the covenant don't start with me god's a
[1:22:13] person
[1:22:15] and brother brown said the person of
[1:22:16] jesus christ comes to you with a new
[1:22:18] birth
[1:22:19] so the person
[1:22:21] a person
[1:22:23] the eternal person
[1:22:25] came to me and we vulcanized
[1:22:29] we vulcanized so much you the devil
[1:22:31] can't pull it apart
[1:22:34] and now god can pump the tire up
[1:22:37] and god can use your vessel or your
[1:22:38] vehicle to get where he needs to go
[1:22:41] all right look for as many as they're
[1:22:42] led by the spirit of god they are the
[1:22:44] sons of god
[1:22:46] first thing you got to do folks remember
[1:22:49] get born again
[1:22:51] to even start your adoption you can get
[1:22:53] partial some of these i believe in
[1:22:55] justification sanctification because
[1:22:56] that is god changing you it's
[1:22:58] sanctification
[1:23:01] it's a work of the holy ghost
[1:23:02] all right
[1:23:04] so you get partial of these but not the
[1:23:06] full
[1:23:07] god can't fully work through you if he's
[1:23:08] not in you
[1:23:10] i'm sorry
[1:23:11] he can give you an anointing but he
[1:23:12] never can work full that's why he didn't
[1:23:13] work through the pentecostal that much
[1:23:15] because they got an anointing a lot of
[1:23:16] times they didn't get the holy ghost
[1:23:19] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:23:20] bondage and to fear but you have
[1:23:22] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:23:23] you cry out of a father the spirit
[1:23:25] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:23:27] that we are
[1:23:28] the composition that is that we are the
[1:23:30] children of god
[1:23:32] and as children than heirs we are the
[1:23:34] children of israel
[1:23:37] they stood up in egypt
[1:23:40] because we'll read something real quick
[1:23:41] they stood up in egypt and said we're
[1:23:42] the children of god
[1:23:45] we have a promise
[1:23:46] and we are not going to stay in egypt
[1:23:49] we went out of here
[1:23:53] because they were children then heirs
[1:23:55] what heirs of the promise
[1:23:58] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[1:24:00] that we suffer with him that we might be
[1:24:02] also
[1:24:03] glorified
[1:24:05] together now we know what the promise is
[1:24:08] acts 2 38
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:11] acts 2 38 says you shall receive the
[1:24:13] gift of the holy ghost for the promises
[1:24:15] unto you and your children and them that
[1:24:17] are far off even as men as our lord our
[1:24:19] god shall call so that's the promise the
[1:24:21] promises in your birth
[1:24:23] but now let's look at something
[1:24:25] real quick let's go all the way down to
[1:24:26] if you don't mind go to number seven
[1:24:30] brothers can continue scrolling in
[1:24:34] and when we're born in the kingdom of
[1:24:36] god by jesus christ we're an heir of
[1:24:38] heaven join ours with jesus because he
[1:24:41] took our place he became us that we
[1:24:42] might become him all right now remember
[1:24:44] let's just read the bread god
[1:24:46] predestinated you by foreknowledge that
[1:24:50] you were coming to this
[1:24:54] everybody understand it raise your hand
[1:24:56] god by foreknowledge predestinated you
[1:24:59] to come to the promised land
[1:25:02] so there was a predestinated group of
[1:25:03] people that was headed toward the
[1:25:05] promised land but there was only two of
[1:25:07] them
[1:25:13] now these were predestinated to fall in
[1:25:14] the wilderness
[1:25:17] under justification and sanctification
[1:25:19] not to get into the promised land
[1:25:22] but there was a group predestinated to
[1:25:24] get into promised land and it was two
[1:25:27] plus the 20 and under that had been what
[1:25:29] raised up
[1:25:32] in the wilderness
[1:25:34] so now let's go to genesis 17 12.
[1:25:36] real quick
[1:25:39] this is what god said about circumcision
[1:25:43] and he that is eight days old shall be
[1:25:45] circumcised among you
[1:25:47] eight days
[1:25:49] why eight days
[1:25:55] eight days is eternity
[1:25:58] seven days is in time
[1:26:00] when you receive the new birth you step
[1:26:01] out of time
[1:26:03] your soul is in eternity as we read
[1:26:05] before a position in heavenly places in
[1:26:08] christ jesus now you're still here
[1:26:10] caught in this dimension but your soul
[1:26:12] is eternal
[1:26:14] and in eight days you shall be
[1:26:15] circumcised now what circumcision the
[1:26:17] type of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:18] everybody got that say amen all right
[1:26:20] real quick and then we'll cover this
[1:26:22] we'll back up on this
[1:26:24] this afternoon let's go to joshua 5 1.
[1:26:27] it came to pass when all the kings of
[1:26:29] the amorites which are on this side
[1:26:31] jordan westward and all the kings of the
[1:26:32] canaanites which were by the sea heard
[1:26:34] that the lord had dried up the waters of
[1:26:36] jordan
[1:26:37] what is jordan
[1:26:39] death
[1:26:41] you got to die
[1:26:43] to get in the promised land you got to
[1:26:44] die didn't i just say that your
[1:26:47] husband's got to be dead
[1:26:50] before the children of israel that we
[1:26:51] were
[1:26:52] until we were passed over that their
[1:26:55] heart melted
[1:26:56] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:26:58] because of the children of israel when
[1:27:00] you become a son and daughter of
[1:27:02] god satan's heart melts
[1:27:06] because number one he lost a good
[1:27:07] soldier
[1:27:08] and number two he knows you're gonna
[1:27:09] fight him and you
[1:27:11] he thinks he's gonna win but we know who
[1:27:12] wins now watch
[1:27:14] at that time the lord said unto joshua
[1:27:16] make these sharp knives
[1:27:18] whoa
[1:27:20] sharp two-edged sword
[1:27:22] now remember
[1:27:24] they just crossed jordan
[1:27:28] into the promised land
[1:27:30] they're right at the edge of the jordan
[1:27:32] they haven't been positionally placed
[1:27:34] yet
[1:27:35] everybody okay with that
[1:27:37] wake up
[1:27:39] thank you
[1:27:41] joshua made him sharp two-edged
[1:27:44] swords and circumcised the children of
[1:27:47] israel at the hill of the foreskins
[1:27:50] and this is the cause why joshua did
[1:27:52] circumcise
[1:27:53] all the people that came out of egypt
[1:27:54] that were males
[1:27:56] even all men of war died in the
[1:27:58] wilderness by the way after they came
[1:28:00] out of egypt that was the group that
[1:28:01] died everybody got that saying ma'am
[1:28:03] i'll be done in just a second now all
[1:28:05] the people that came out were
[1:28:06] circumcised
[1:28:08] that was coming from
[1:28:09] the world
[1:28:11] egypt
[1:28:13] their command was to get circumcised on
[1:28:15] the eighth day
[1:28:17] right
[1:28:18] right at the birth
[1:28:20] but they walked all this time god had to
[1:28:22] get rid of all them people the
[1:28:23] unbelievers
[1:28:25] and had to raise up a new group but that
[1:28:27] new group hadn't been circumcised yet
[1:28:30] it just come through justification and
[1:28:31] sanctification
[1:28:33] they're about right with that
[1:28:35] now all the people that came out were
[1:28:36] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:28:38] born in the wilderness by the way as
[1:28:39] they came forth out of egypt then they
[1:28:41] had not circumcised for the children of
[1:28:44] israel walked 40 years in the wilderness
[1:28:46] to all the people that were men of war
[1:28:48] which came out of egypt were consumed
[1:28:51] because they obeyed not the voice of god
[1:28:56] preeminence
[1:28:58] unto
[1:28:59] whom the lord swear that he would not
[1:29:01] show them the land which the lord swear
[1:29:04] unto their fathers that he would give us
[1:29:06] a land that floweth with milk and honey
[1:29:08] and their children whom he raised up in
[1:29:10] their stead that's us
[1:29:15] that's we
[1:29:17] that's us
[1:29:18] not they
[1:29:20] and their children whom he raised up in
[1:29:22] their stead
[1:29:24] they were still children
[1:29:25] they were still children of israel
[1:29:27] they were just younger watch
[1:29:29] them joshua circumcised
[1:29:32] for they were circumcised because they
[1:29:33] had not circumcised them by the way
[1:29:37] and it came to pass when they had done
[1:29:39] circumcising all the people that they
[1:29:41] abode in their places in the camp till
[1:29:42] they were whole
[1:29:44] and the lord said unto joshua this day
[1:29:46] have i rolled away the reproach of egypt
[1:29:48] from off of you hmm
[1:29:53] this is a circumcision in the promised
[1:29:54] land
[1:29:56] this is cutting off the old stuff after
[1:29:57] we already get in the promised land amen
[1:30:00] this day if i rolled away the republic
[1:30:02] of egypt from off you wherefore the name
[1:30:04] of this place is called gilgal until
[1:30:05] this day and the children of israel
[1:30:07] camped in gilgal and kept the passover
[1:30:08] in the 14th day
[1:30:10] of the month and even in plains of
[1:30:12] jericho go back go back down to verse
[1:30:16] verse 8.
[1:30:19] and it came to pass when they had done
[1:30:20] circumcising all the people
[1:30:24] that they abode in their places in the
[1:30:26] camp till they were whole
[1:30:28] why
[1:30:34] it hurt
[1:30:37] for you men we understand that
[1:30:40] if you get circumcised at 20 years old
[1:30:42] you're gonna walk different
[1:30:45] don't you walk different after the new
[1:30:47] birth don't you walk different after you
[1:30:49] get in the promised land
[1:30:50] god has to keep cutting the old foreskin
[1:30:52] off
[1:30:53] so that he can be
[1:30:55] made known
[1:30:57] but they had to wait
[1:31:00] until they were made whole so in other
[1:31:01] words so they could walk again same way
[1:31:03] with me and you when you get you get in
[1:31:05] the promised land you're going to
[1:31:06] flounder around a little bit
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] you're going to make mistakes
[1:31:11] you're going to get sick you're going to
[1:31:13] get all these different things that
[1:31:14] maybe you had not got before i never was
[1:31:16] a sick person until after i received the
[1:31:17] new birth
[1:31:18] you know
[1:31:20] in my body amen
[1:31:22] but you know what that's okay
[1:31:24] i'll take it
[1:31:26] so let's read this verse 11 go back down
[1:31:28] to 11. now when they got into the
[1:31:29] promised land musicians come
[1:31:32] the children of israel and captain
[1:31:34] gilgal kept the passover in the 14th day
[1:31:36] of the month and even in plains of
[1:31:37] jericho they passed over jordan
[1:31:41] now what happened it was very
[1:31:42] significant they didn't eat
[1:31:46] what they ate in the wilderness anymore
[1:31:51] under justification and sanctification
[1:31:54] you had to hear a new message
[1:31:58] you had to eat of the old corn of the
[1:32:00] land
[1:32:01] the mantis ceased on the day they
[1:32:03] crossed over
[1:32:05] in other words their food ceased and
[1:32:07] then what happened they had to go out
[1:32:08] and harvest
[1:32:10] of the old corner of the land it wasn't
[1:32:12] god didn't just i mean you know you
[1:32:13] could stand here and just catch you a
[1:32:15] bucket full of kentucky fried chicken
[1:32:18] joe forney would be shouting at the
[1:32:20] moment
[1:32:22] papa yo you got that
[1:32:23] popeyes you ain't kidding popeye's best
[1:32:26] chicken in the world
[1:32:28] anyway that's no plug for popeyes
[1:32:29] they're not paying for this
[1:32:31] this is not a promotion
[1:32:33] but it is good but i mean really they
[1:32:36] just took their their bucket out in the
[1:32:37] morning and they piled it full of manna
[1:32:41] went back in rolled it up made made food
[1:32:43] out of it
[1:32:45] but god told him said look when you get
[1:32:47] in that promised land
[1:32:48] you're gonna have to eat different
[1:32:50] man
[1:32:53] you're gonna have to eat different
[1:32:55] you're gonna have to think different
[1:32:57] you're gonna have to talk different
[1:32:59] and you definitely have already started
[1:33:01] walking different that's right
[1:33:03] amen because of the circumcision
[1:33:06] so all that now we're in the promised
[1:33:08] land this afternoon we'll talk about the
[1:33:09] placing what joshua did to him but let's
[1:33:12] stand to our feet
[1:33:13] they eat the old corn of the land on the
[1:33:16] moral after the passover
[1:33:18] unleavened cakes and parts corn in the
[1:33:21] same day they started eating food that
[1:33:24] came from the ground
[1:33:26] they started eating food that they had
[1:33:27] to harvest
[1:33:29] but remember they didn't plant it
[1:33:33] they didn't plant it the people that
[1:33:34] were there planted it
[1:33:36] they took and ate it
[1:33:39] and it gave them nourishment
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:45] we can have a message
[1:33:49] of eternal life
[1:33:53] but there's also a message of you moving
[1:33:55] on after your eternal life after you
[1:33:56] give receiving the new birth
[1:33:59] there's a promised land a positional
[1:34:01] placing
[1:34:02] joshua didn't just say
[1:34:04] you know joshua didn't just walk across
[1:34:06] jordan have all this great powerful
[1:34:08] thing going on
[1:34:10] and say all right y'all just
[1:34:13] have at it
[1:34:15] no
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:17] god wanted them placed exactly where
[1:34:19] those mothers screamed their name he
[1:34:21] wanted to place because they did
[1:34:23] something in that part of their land
[1:34:24] that you can't do over here brother
[1:34:26] brown said our problem was is we're over
[1:34:29] in ephraim's field
[1:34:30] eating corn when we should be in our own
[1:34:32] field in manassa if manassas corn eat
