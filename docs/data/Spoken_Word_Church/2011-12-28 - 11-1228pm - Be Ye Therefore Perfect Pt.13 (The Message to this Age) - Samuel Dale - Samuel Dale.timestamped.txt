[6:08] Jesus name
[6:10] amen Matthew 5 that we've been reading
[6:13] and Revelations three we thought we was
[6:16] going to be through with that but we
[6:18] just keep on going so we don't worry
[6:20] about it we the Lord will take care of
[6:23] it right amen Matthew
[6:26] 5:37 but let your communication be a y
[6:29] nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[6:32] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[6:35] it hath been said an eye for an eye and
[6:36] a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you
[6:39] that you this not evil but
[6:42] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[6:45] cheek turn to him the other also and if
[6:48] any man shall Sue thee at the law and
[6:51] take away thy coat let him have thy
[6:53] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[6:56] the to go a mile go with him Twain give
[6:59] give to him that asketh thee and from
[7:01] him that would borrow of thee turn not
[7:05] thou away you have heard that it hath
[7:08] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[7:10] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[7:13] love your enemies bless them that curse
[7:16] you and do good to them that hate and
[7:19] that curse you and do good to them that
[7:21] hate you and pray for them which
[7:23] despitefully use you and persecute you
[7:26] why that you may be the children of your
[7:28] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[7:31] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[7:34] good and sendeth rain on the just and on
[7:36] the unjust for if you love them which
[7:39] love you what reward have ye do not even
[7:41] the publicans the same if you salute
[7:44] your brethren only what do ye more than
[7:47] others do not even the public and soul
[7:49] be therefore perfect even as your father
[7:52] which is in heaven is perfect amen let's
[7:55] just go over to one scripture
[7:57] Revelations
[7:58] 3:14 is the message to this age and what
[8:01] does it say and unto the angel of the
[8:03] Church of the lady of
[8:05] candra these things say at the amen the
[8:07] faithful and true witness the beginning
[8:10] of the creation of God you may be seated
[8:14] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[8:17] the word
[8:21] now we've been studying for quite a
[8:24] while
[8:25] on this part of being therefore perfect
[8:29] and uh we've come down to a conclusion
[8:33] that we in our last message and we won't
[8:36] get through with these notes tonight I'm
[8:38] sure but I wanted you to read them and
[8:41] so uh keep them until the next Wednesday
[8:44] night and uh we'll be uh speaking on
[8:47] these things or carrying on the thought
[8:50] but you know the message to this
[8:53] age each age got a message a special uh
[8:58] revelation of about God and you know his
[9:02] ways and doings and things and we we
[9:06] just uh look at our age and we see that
[9:09] it says he's the beginning of the
[9:10] creation of
[9:12] God now what was our thoughts about
[9:15] reading from Matthew there in the
[9:18] scripture that we've been reading for
[9:20] quite a while you know of Matthew that
[9:23] uh it's talking
[9:25] about the uh fact that the Lord Jesus he
[9:29] had come from the the be Beatitudes of
[9:32] saying blessed are you you know because
[9:34] of this that and the other that
[9:36] persecutes you and thing but then he
[9:38] started changing kind of a course or
[9:41] order of of uh talking and as he did he
[9:45] be to talk about how the children of
[9:49] this new
[9:51] creation having his
[9:54] nature and all would come to the point
[9:58] that we would be able to uh withstand
[10:01] Satan when he comes after us and the
[10:04] ways that he always does and that we
[10:07] would be of that new race of people and
[10:10] that this age would get the special
[10:12] revelation of it of a new creation amen
[10:16] now each age got the new creation each
[10:18] age got the new birth all right but this
[10:21] is a summing up of all of the things and
[10:24] bringing it out to where that we can see
[10:28] you know the age that we're really
[10:30] living in amen and understanding then a
[10:33] a new creature as we read there in
[10:35] Matthew where it says uh this will be
[10:38] you you you'll be the children of
[10:40] God then you'll have this kind of a
[10:42] nature so he was saying you know this is
[10:45] the nature that is is expected to come
[10:47] into to you then he says be therefore
[10:52] perfect because that way he's saying
[10:55] that there's no way that you and I could
[10:59] uh have the nature that he spoke of
[11:03] right now
[11:06] uh think on this for a minute it is not
[11:10] our natural nature to turn the other
[11:14] cheek uh it's not our natural nature to
[11:19] if we're sued to give a man more than
[11:21] what he sues us
[11:23] far that's not our
[11:25] nature it's not our nature to do those
[11:28] things
[11:29] but if we have a new nature a new way
[11:34] amen then the Lord Jesus could be
[11:36] smitten on one side and turn the other
[11:38] one that's right all
[11:41] right see he's showing us as I said the
[11:44] only way that you and I can come to this
[11:48] place of where that we could ever think
[11:50] about being perfect right would to be to
[11:54] the basis that we could get rid of
[11:56] ourselves right right man and take take
[11:59] on a new nature or new ways a new
[12:01] thought all right and see that's why I I
[12:04] tried to to bring it to you there in the
[12:07] the last message as speaking about it
[12:10] that asking who was this man that could
[12:13] it's possible that the psalmist David
[12:16] would say and and Romans would say and
[12:18] brother randam would bring them together
[12:20] and and say it you know we brought those
[12:22] things out that that they would say
[12:25] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[12:27] impute sin all right and see you could
[12:31] get all kind of definitions of certain
[12:34] well you know so good of a righteous
[12:36] person you know a good person and this
[12:39] that or the other or you could come into
[12:42] the message or the hour of people you
[12:44] know that well uh I was a child of God
[12:48] always was eternal so I don't have to
[12:51] worry about anything see and it would go
[12:53] into disgrace right amen upon all of the
[12:56] ways that we would try to understand it
[12:59] but I hope you picked up the point cuz
[13:01] I'm trying to make things so
[13:04] simple until you know uh an illiterate
[13:08] person can understand amen that's right
[13:11] and and that way then anybody can
[13:15] understand it that's right you know
[13:18] because you know you bring it down to a
[13:20] basis of a person that doesn't have much
[13:23] intelligence and and you just tell that
[13:26] person say now listen
[13:29] what you need to do you need to New
[13:32] Birth right right and they'd say well
[13:36] how do I get it right right well we can
[13:40] go through the the process of saying
[13:43] well you've got to do this and you got
[13:44] to do
[13:45] that but according to the
[13:49] prophet people ask about being saved and
[13:53] he said we try to tell them what to do
[13:55] and not do
[13:57] right
[13:59] but you see the the whole thing is to
[14:02] what repent be baptized in the name of
[14:05] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[14:07] and you shall receive the gift of the
[14:08] Holy Ghost that's simple amen but it's
[14:12] true right it's held for 2,000 years
[14:15] amen as a simple thought
[14:17] right but now what would you tell the
[14:21] person then that would ask you that
[14:23] you'd say well now I know a lot of
[14:25] people that has repented and they have
[14:28] inde did sure and a lot of people got
[14:30] baptized in the correct way you know yep
[14:33] mhm and still didn't get saved no that's
[14:36] right you would agree with that wouldn't
[14:38] you that a lot of people don't well
[14:41] what's the
[14:43] problem now they've done what the word
[14:46] says
[14:49] mhm they followed the channel of the
[14:51] letter
[14:52] Y right
[14:54] mhm and they could even say now Lord
[14:58] like I've heard people say you know well
[15:00] now the Lord knows my heart and uh if he
[15:04] don't save me like the one man did and
[15:07] he was true about what he was saying he
[15:09] said Lord if you don't he was out in a a
[15:11] field play praying and he said Lord if
[15:13] you don't save me said you'll find a
[15:15] pile of bones laying here in this field
[15:17] when you come back well that man had a
[15:20] sincere heart and he meant it that's
[15:22] right amen but see how many people could
[15:24] go out in the yard or anywhere or do
[15:26] whatever and say now Lord you said it
[15:31] right and the prophet
[15:35] said the Bible says it in the prophet of
[15:39] God that we claim to
[15:40] said if we repent and be baptized in the
[15:44] name of Jesus Christ we shall be saved
[15:46] amen so now you said it and you meant it
[15:48] why is it they're not saved that's right
[15:51] come on you don't ever think or those
[15:53] that's right yes sir amen now I hope you
[15:56] understand what I'm saying because a lot
[15:58] of people are saved because that's the
[16:00] way they do it that's the way you got to
[16:01] go y right but what's the
[16:05] difference that was what I was trying to
[16:08] express to you the last message in so
[16:11] simple a terms of one
[16:13] thing before there can be a new
[16:17] birth there must be a
[16:20] death of the
[16:24] individual before they can receive a new
[16:26] birth amen not a killing of physically
[16:31] right but dying out to yourself MH and
[16:36] accepting Jesus Christ in your
[16:39] place to where that you are dead right
[16:46] amen cuz that that is the you say well
[16:50] no Brother
[16:52] D the the qualifications of the new
[16:55] birth is we got to be justified
[16:57] sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[16:59] see that's good right that's
[17:04] fine but you know there's a lot of
[17:06] people that are
[17:07] Justified a lot of people that are
[17:11] Sanctified yep and never receive the
[17:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right
[17:17] why because they never
[17:20] died amen right cuz you can't get the
[17:24] the the life until the death comes right
[17:27] death comes first first amen right this
[17:30] what I was trying to express to us and
[17:33] anyone else
[17:35] listening we don't hear much talked
[17:37] about
[17:38] dying we just hear all of this great
[17:41] about what we are and who we are and and
[17:44] what we was and how we was here and what
[17:47] was here and yeah and never talk
[17:51] about simply dying out to yourself
[17:55] amen cuz it can't be a new birth if
[17:58] you're not not dead amen
[18:00] amen right it just won't work that's
[18:04] right that's the message to this age
[18:11] right what that we must die out to
[18:14] ourselves that was a message of Paul's
[18:17] age that's a message to every age has
[18:19] been required a death
[18:22] right but this
[18:25] age right on this age is required more
[18:30] than just a
[18:32] death to get the new
[18:36] birth because it's going to require
[18:38] change of the body
[18:40] amen all
[18:42] right and if we can't die out to
[18:45] ourselves and get born
[18:50] again how in the world could we ever
[18:52] come to a change of a body right that's
[18:54] right
[18:57] amen are you
[19:01] listening see then that's where our
[19:03] trouble
[19:06] is see we must die out to ourselves to
[19:09] be born again
[19:10] amen then it's a continual dying to
[19:13] yourself amen all the way through life
[19:17] that's
[19:18] right and if we can become dead
[19:22] enough see then God can change each
[19:25] bodies that's right amen now if you
[19:28] don't get nothing out of the message
[19:30] tonight I want you to get this
[19:33] point before there can be a birth there
[19:37] must be a death
[19:39] amen before there can be a body
[19:44] change that's right are you
[19:46] listening there must be a group of
[19:49] people that are so
[19:53] dead now we're talking about body change
[19:55] right are you following me that's right
[19:57] I'm not talking about trying to
[19:58] dechristianize anybody or whatever I've
[20:01] preached that for 30 years told you 30
[20:04] years or more ago that most of the
[20:06] people maybe even myself would not be
[20:08] able to have enough Faith to stand there
[20:10] for a change of the body the change in a
[20:12] moment the twinkle of an eye so we're
[20:14] going to have to go by the grave
[20:17] right you say well it's just old getting
[20:20] old we're getting old that's part of it
[20:22] right but there's a lot of young people
[20:25] that's in this message are dying also
[20:27] that's
[20:30] it's because and not de christianizing
[20:32] anybody that's
[20:35] right but if you and I can't die out to
[20:38] ourselves and become a new
[20:43] creation then we're not born again no
[20:46] that's
[20:47] right that's
[20:52] right
[20:53] then and this is the whole message
[20:55] tonight so then we'll back up and then
[20:57] we'll read and start again
[20:58] him
[21:01] then there comes such a sanctification
[21:04] under that six seal until the world is
[21:07] totally purged of sin that's
[21:10] right you agree man right the Jews are
[21:14] placed in there for the cleansing y the
[21:17] foolish virgins are there for the
[21:19] cleansing y but we don't have to go
[21:22] there amen cuz Jesus Christ has done
[21:24] paid the price yes sir amen
[21:26] amen so that means that we go in a
[21:29] Rapture before them
[21:32] amen but if all of us die and go by the
[21:34] grave who's going to be there for the
[21:36] change right right so why can't we
[21:40] contend that we are the people that will
[21:42] be changed yes sir amen and if it is
[21:46] it's going to take a dine
[21:50] right the prophet of God was praying
[21:52] there one time he said Lord you shed me
[21:55] you know like cutting a sheep cutting a
[21:57] wool off of a sheep you know sure every
[21:59] how you pronounce that word sure
[22:03] sure he said Lord you done it one
[22:06] time yes he said you took my
[22:10] wife you took my daughter
[22:13] y he said do it again
[22:17] Lord now that's how much he thought
[22:19] about it
[22:20] amen what he want to lose two second
[22:23] wife and another kid now that's about as
[22:25] dumb as anybody can get so that's all
[22:28] you can think about you in a terrible
[22:29] shape that's
[22:31] right he was wanting God to bring him
[22:34] down to his knees Amen to where he
[22:37] needed to be a death to himself
[22:43] amen all
[22:45] right see then we can't expect to have a
[22:48] change of the
[22:50] body I'm talking about you me all of us
[22:53] that's
[22:55] right until we learn to or bring that
[22:58] body under death
[23:02] man from the inside person amen right
[23:06] right amen it can't be done in their
[23:08] outside doings
[23:10] right
[23:12] right there's no way out side that you
[23:14] can can whip the body into to
[23:18] dying the more you whip it the worse it
[23:24] gets so it must be that we've got to
[23:27] start from the end
[23:28] inside so then this age gets a message
[23:31] then
[23:33] y a special
[23:36] message that he's the beginning of the
[23:38] creation of God Amen right all
[23:43] right and then there's no way that you
[23:45] can connect that to Natural things right
[23:49] amen and all must be to Supernatural
[23:52] spiritual things
[23:56] right all right
[23:58] and see he so died until he was the one
[24:01] that was telling us these
[24:02] things turn the other
[24:05] cheek do all of these
[24:10] things then he said be therefore perfect
[24:13] in other words be just is perfect in
[24:14] other words take on my nature right
[24:16] right
[24:17] right all
[24:20] right cuz it's only the only way that
[24:22] our bodies can be changed we've got to
[24:24] have this body's got to be if we don't
[24:26] believe in getting another one amen and
[24:29] that's why most people were talking
[24:31] about that earlier about it I've always
[24:34] told you that I told you the reason
[24:37] people don't believe in the people of
[24:38] this message I'm talking about a lot of
[24:41] a lot of preachers preach we're going to
[24:42] get a new
[24:44] body and they're talking about another
[24:47] body some say they're going to get a new
[24:49] body and they kind of leave it to where
[24:51] whoever wants to what group they're in
[24:53] to where you can decide what you want to
[24:55] believe about it right sorry it's just a
[24:58] way I thing
[25:01] right see everybody says they're going
[25:03] to get a new body don't mean they're
[25:05] going to get another body you talk to
[25:07] them a while and that's oh no I mean
[25:08] we're going to get this body
[25:10] redeemed well that's good but I'd rather
[25:12] just be blunt about it nobody don't have
[25:15] to worry about what I'm talking about
[25:16] that's
[25:18] righten but you see I've told you this
[25:20] how many times I made this statement the
[25:23] reason most people don't believe in
[25:24] getting that they want to get a new body
[25:26] they don't believe God is capable of
[25:28] redeeming this body right right that's
[25:31] it now they believe that he's capable of
[25:33] saving their
[25:36] soul and if he wants
[25:39] to he can heal the
[25:42] body yeah now you say well no no no no
[25:46] we know he can heal no that's that's the
[25:48] basis of it most people think that if he
[25:50] wants to that's what they do we'll ask
[25:53] the Lord to see what he wants to be done
[25:58] we'll ask the Lord if he wants to heal
[26:02] us you ever done
[26:05] that you ever said Lord do you want to
[26:07] heal me
[26:09] or is it right for you to heal
[26:12] me we're not supposed to do that right
[26:16] we're supposed to say we're healed
[26:20] amen see that way then people believe
[26:23] that you could be you know maybe if the
[26:24] Lord wants to he can heal you then they
[26:26] say well we're going to give some new
[26:27] body cuz you don't believe he's powerful
[26:29] enough to redeem this
[26:30] one now that's not the message of this
[26:33] age that was what hit me I had notes in
[26:36] this to go on with another point tonight
[26:38] but it kept hitting on this cuz I want
[26:42] you to make sure you understood what I
[26:43] was say in this past
[26:46] Wednesday that you and I must die
[26:51] amen we've got to die for oursel to be
[26:54] born again
[26:56] amen
[26:59] see Paul said it's not I that liveth but
[27:02] Christ that liveth in me
[27:05] right right
[27:08] right he had no point or thought of his
[27:10] own self cuz he believed he was dead I
[27:13] was noticing there we was the other day
[27:15] listening or either today reading or
[27:17] yesterday or something brother Brown
[27:19] said that I died 32 years ago
[27:26] m
[27:29] now my daddy
[27:30] died somewhere about
[27:35] 1945 it'd be hard to condemn him
[27:40] of or bring a case against him about a
[27:43] crime today wouldn't
[27:46] it because he's
[27:50] dead but you see that's the way we're
[27:53] supposed to
[27:54] be
[27:56] right we're supposed supposed to be so
[27:58] dead until we're not alive anymore cuz
[28:00] you can't be a new Creature if you're
[28:03] alive did you understand what I was
[28:05] trying to bring out Amen to be a new
[28:11] creature Paul said that you're a new
[28:13] creation you new creature there in what
[28:16] it 2 Corinthians 5:17 or first
[28:20] one a new
[28:25] creation well if you're a new creation
[28:27] then the old creation can't be alive at
[28:29] the same time cuz the prophet of God
[28:31] said he's not dealing by that
[28:35] ways and see there's no way for us to to
[28:39] still be alive and Christ alive in us
[28:41] too
[28:42] right he said no now brother there we're
[28:45] still yeah we're still alive that's our
[28:47] problem man because there a body and the
[28:50] spirit to be dealt with right that
[28:53] didn't die to get a new birth right it
[28:57] was only the death of the Soul right
[28:59] right and it wasn't the death of the
[29:02] Soul like taking the soul out and
[29:03] throwing it
[29:05] away it was the death of the nature of
[29:08] that Soul right yes sir amen which was
[29:11] of the world right that's right see then
[29:16] God can come in and live
[29:19] man but if we're not dead he can't come
[29:22] in and live that's right you you can't
[29:24] claim to be a new
[29:26] Creature if the old creature still
[29:29] lives that's why you're born again in
[29:31] your soul not your body and your spirit
[29:34] see in body and spirit we're still of
[29:35] the old creation right
[29:37] amen even though we've been given a new
[29:42] spirit that still is not the Holy Spirit
[29:45] right right that's just a new spirit cuz
[29:48] you couldn't stand your own self the
[29:49] prophet said right he said you had to
[29:52] get a new spirit to be able to even
[29:56] fellowship with God and in any form
[29:58] right that's
[30:00] it you see why the new birth is the most
[30:02] important thing in there is amen I
[30:05] reading today where brother R said when
[30:06] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[30:08] Ghost he said you get everything he said
[30:11] you get all the power you need he said
[30:14] you get all the healing you need he said
[30:16] you get all the Deliverance you need
[30:19] that's right when you receive the new
[30:22] birth he said but you just got to keep
[30:24] drinking and pushing out right that's
[30:27] right
[30:29] see that's our part right is to drink in
[30:32] and push out God supplies
[30:35] it but you see then it's a dead man that
[30:41] Paul is talking
[30:43] about that God won't impute sin that's
[30:45] right
[30:48] M it's a dead man the psalmist David was
[30:51] talking
[30:55] about because there's no way impute sin
[30:57] to a dead man right amen if he's truly
[31:00] dead
[31:03] mhm all
[31:06] right and if we're not dead we didn't
[31:08] get the new birth
[31:13] right come on is that true right MH see
[31:16] the problem with most people as they say
[31:19] it they'll take the word follow the word
[31:22] right to the l y I've had people to tell
[31:25] me that say brother Dale I've done
[31:26] everything thing that God told me to do
[31:28] and what's
[31:30] wrong why haven't I received the New
[31:35] Birth when I've done everything he told
[31:37] me to
[31:40] do I said I had received a new
[31:44] birth well now doing what God says to do
[31:48] is wonderful or don't
[31:51] do but I thought we believe that even
[31:54] Abraham received an unconditional
[31:57] Covenant y
[32:01] amen and that we are the Seed of Abraham
[32:04] by faith amen by the new
[32:08] birth now justification in this day
[32:11] don't put you in the body of Christ so
[32:13] your sins can be chopped
[32:15] off and that's
[32:19] good you can be
[32:22] Sanctified right cleansed and set aside
[32:24] for service wonderful
[32:28] but that's not death no
[32:32] Amen Brother Brad on a future home if
[32:34] you'll read it right about 15 16 right
[32:37] there somewhere you hear him saying this
[32:39] he said when that Holy Ghost comes in he
[32:41] said it burns
[32:44] out everything that's left that's
[32:47] right amen you said well the unclean
[32:51] Spirit went out you know everything went
[32:54] out what what's left you and I yeah
[32:57] that's it amen that's what's left you
[33:00] and I
[33:01] right what would we be y turn it loose
[33:06] right there you just go right back to
[33:07] the pig pin
[33:10] right but you see we've got to be to be
[33:12] born again we've got to have a death
[33:15] amen right
[33:17] amen and that's the
[33:22] man now how is it possible for you and I
[33:24] to die spiritually speaking
[33:28] it's easy to understand natural death
[33:30] right whacker got's head off at gone
[33:34] right but spiritually
[33:38] speaking see we must die out to
[33:42] ourselves
[33:44] right we must come to a place we saying
[33:48] Lord there's nothing I can do that's
[33:51] right I've done all I can do I've done
[33:55] what you asked me to do right now if
[33:57] there's anything wrong let me
[33:59] know if not let me die
[34:04] right and when we talk about dying to
[34:06] ourselves that means we give up all
[34:08] rights yep
[34:11] amen she don't have no
[34:13] rights we give up all the rights
[34:17] everything well bless God I I'll tell
[34:20] you what you you fool with me I ain't
[34:22] turning the other
[34:23] cheek you're not dead right amen
[34:29] I told you about it that was one of the
[34:31] things I always wondered in my life even
[34:34] after becoming a
[34:35] Christian I thought cuz I it just that
[34:39] way I understood how that two men could
[34:42] take gloves and slap each other's face
[34:44] and because of an argument turn around
[34:46] take a gun and just shoot each other cuz
[34:49] that was an insult see
[34:52] this you insult the
[34:55] person and they're dignity is demanded
[34:58] and they must shoot or kill you know or
[35:01] die I can understand that because that
[35:03] was the way I was
[35:06] made don't say good that I ain't never
[35:08] lost a fight yet I might have run away
[35:11] from a
[35:12] few I never lost
[35:16] one but now
[35:19] listen I can understand those things
[35:22] right and I always wondered I thought
[35:25] Lord
[35:27] is your grace
[35:30] sufficient I I don't know Lord I believe
[35:35] you I believe I'm born again and all
[35:38] that Lord but you know and by doing that
[35:41] you know what it
[35:42] meant it me I was opening up that door
[35:45] for Satan to try me that's right and I
[35:48] shouldn't have been thinking that way
[35:50] but I was just honest ain't you right
[35:53] that's the best way to be with your own
[35:55] s and the got there work one day you
[35:57] remember something happened and he
[35:58] slapped my
[36:00] jaws I mean he rung them
[36:03] good and I just stood there
[36:06] grinning and looking at
[36:09] him I thought it's
[36:14] gone I mean you seen what a expression
[36:17] come over this man's
[36:20] face when he just slapped a guy that was
[36:23] as big as he was and you
[36:25] know
[36:28] and the guy didn't
[36:30] move I just stood there grinning at
[36:33] him he just turned around and left and I
[36:36] mean he got gone he stayed gone for he's
[36:39] supposed to repair what I was doing you
[36:42] know he stayed gone quite a while and he
[36:45] come back he said I'm sorry about what I
[36:46] done I said that's all
[36:50] right see I found out that at least at
[36:54] that point that man was dead right
[36:57] sure
[36:59] now you know I spend a lot of time
[37:02] explaining
[37:06] things as we've reading in
[37:08] Matthew in Matthew it says if a man sues
[37:11] you for your coat give him your CL
[37:13] cultural now I
[37:16] mean now how does that work out you know
[37:21] all
[37:21] right
[37:23] now that's M okay
[37:27] now brother call you sued me from
[37:28] there's my
[37:29] coat all
[37:31] right just take everything else I got
[37:34] now is that what that
[37:36] means now come on be sensible is that
[37:40] what that
[37:41] means the guy sues you for your coat
[37:44] give him your cloak also is that what
[37:46] that
[37:48] means words you just give him everything
[37:50] you
[37:53] got I don't think that way that's right
[37:57] I don't think that's what he's trying to
[37:58] make the
[38:01] point the point is if a man sues you for
[38:04] you coat and your
[38:08] cloak all
[38:10] right and the judge says now I we just
[38:12] take your coat well then all right I'll
[38:15] just give him a cloak
[38:19] to I don't think it means to be
[38:22] just give
[38:24] everything you say yes it does well okay
[38:27] I'm just making a good
[38:30] point because that's what I mean by
[38:32] death right
[38:35] that's that day there was something
[38:39] there when that man slapped me there was
[38:40] something
[38:44] there that I had no thoughts about
[38:46] hitting him whatsoever
[38:49] right I felt sorry for
[38:52] him and no thoughts of striking him I
[38:55] want to hug his neck
[38:58] he done me a favor right
[39:02] right he let me know
[39:05] something but now let's get on that
[39:09] point but now does it mean that he comes
[39:12] back and he he says well I tell you what
[39:15] let me just do it again turn the other
[39:18] okay go
[39:20] ahead then he turns back hit now after a
[39:24] while you're going to end something
[39:27] see we're not
[39:29] done right right you don't just stand
[39:32] there and say well here's the other
[39:34] cheat here's the other cheat here's the
[39:35] other cheat here's the other cheat no
[39:39] no I'm not that a mate I'm I'm sorry
[39:42] maybe you are maybe that's what you
[39:46] think now I'm just telling you there was
[39:48] something there that day that was
[39:50] letting me know the next day if that guy
[39:53] slapped me I might have hit him
[39:55] back
[39:57] you say brother
[39:58] Dale I'm just telling you like it is
[40:01] that's the way I talk you won't talk
[40:03] that way but I
[40:05] do you want a goody goody so much until
[40:08] you do it then first thing you know you
[40:10] blow up and you lose it and then when
[40:11] you lose it you don't know what to do
[40:13] see I don't I don't have to worry about
[40:14] it then I believe that if one of you SLA
[40:17] me again that'd be fine I can take
[40:23] it but it's just like I told a man one
[40:25] day
[40:27] he said I'm coming over there and beat
[40:28] you to death I said you won't come over
[40:32] here I'm pretty good size well guy you
[40:34] know and when I don't green I look a
[40:36] little bit tough you know you won't come
[40:39] over
[40:40] here why not I said cuz you don't know
[40:43] whether I'm going to hit you back or
[40:44] not and I said I really don't know
[40:46] either do you get over
[40:51] here I'm just honest what are you sure
[40:57] and what I'm getting at is one
[41:00] thing what does it mean to die Ain got
[41:03] know forgive it what does it mean to
[41:08] die you die to yourself and you become
[41:11] born again right but you still got a lot
[41:14] of problems right right a lot of
[41:16] troubles lot of heartaches need a lot of
[41:19] trials and
[41:20] tribulation need a lot of patience you
[41:24] need a lot of virtue and knowledge and
[41:26] Temperance and things right and God
[41:30] understand
[41:32] that you
[41:35] know got to understands those thing
[41:40] right so he gives it to us when we need
[41:42] it thank God for that that's
[41:46] right but you see he gives us enough to
[41:49] get born
[41:50] again now the rest of it now this is
[41:53] what I've always tried to preach to you
[41:55] from the day I started hear
[41:56] in any form of preaching I've tried to
[41:58] preach one
[42:00] thing salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9
[42:04] you accept it God accepts you brother R
[42:07] said if God don't accept you you don't
[42:10] have it he said whether or not you
[42:12] accept him is not the point he said it's
[42:15] whether or not he accepts you that's
[42:17] right right right see if he accepts you
[42:21] that's fine
[42:23] amen but you say well I've accepted him
[42:27] all right
[42:29] wonderful and that's if that's a genuine
[42:32] acceptance right that's it he'll accept
[42:34] you right amen but if it's not genuine
[42:38] it's
[42:40] words thoughts and our mouth wiggling a
[42:45] lot but you
[42:48] see even after he gives you the new
[42:50] birth
[42:52] right we got a lot of dying to do right
[42:55] right
[42:57] there is when we can really start dying
[42:59] to
[43:01] ourselves right what we' done before
[43:04] then was accepting him as our place you
[43:07] know in our place or what he done for us
[43:10] accepting him as a savior and then he
[43:13] accepts
[43:16] us but when you become born
[43:20] again now here's what legalists don't
[43:23] like and and disgraced people don't like
[43:26] the way that I preach I'm sorry I just
[43:29] like to tell it like it
[43:33] is cuz you see when we become a
[43:37] Christian we we become responsible right
[43:40] right that's
[43:42] it amen yes sir come on we become
[43:48] responsible y
[43:50] amen that's why I know know always T you
[43:54] you know Paul said you know they they
[43:57] got to the point they thought that Paul
[43:58] was saying well let's just let's just go
[44:00] out of sin where we get more
[44:03] grace he said where could abound he said
[44:06] God forbid amen whatever you make
[44:09] yourself a servant to is who your master
[44:11] is Right amen
[44:14] paraphrase but you see once we become a
[44:16] Christian then is when we can really
[44:17] start dying
[44:20] right the nature change has come the new
[44:24] birth is present we're a new
[44:27] creature a new
[44:30] creation not I that liveth Paul said but
[44:33] Christ that liveth in me
[44:35] amen but see we fail to read the rest of
[44:37] it he said and the life that I now live
[44:39] in the flesh
[44:41] right yep he brought his body right into
[44:44] it right he said I live by the faith of
[44:47] God Amen I Die daily he said
[44:54] right
[44:57] what about a man that's beat five times
[44:59] and Shipwrecked all these other things
[45:00] and then he he doesn't say a thing about
[45:02] that is being any of his death right
[45:05] amen come on read it he doesn't bring in
[45:08] all of the things that happen to him as
[45:10] to be anything of a death
[45:12] right he just says I Die
[45:19] daily but are you following me the new
[45:22] birth puts us in a place that when then
[45:25] we can start yielding ourselves right
[45:28] right turning ourselves over to him yeah
[45:31] now is where a lot of the word has to
[45:33] come in yeah I've always taught you that
[45:35] because I believe it I believe the
[45:37] stature of perfect man can only be added
[45:38] because of the revealing of the word
[45:40] amen that's right not because you desire
[45:43] to have patience and you to say well
[45:45] I'll have it
[45:47] no people say I tell you I've heard
[45:49] people say this then well I tell you
[45:51] what I I didn't know whether I was a
[45:52] Christian or not but I read in the Bible
[45:54] one day that the that
[45:57] The Godly in Christ you know she'll
[45:58] suffer persecution said well I've been
[46:00] in a lot of persecution so I know I'm a
[46:03] Christian now I've never said that cuz I
[46:05] don't believe it way right amen I
[46:07] believe there is a lot of persecution a
[46:09] lot of troubles
[46:10] right amen I believe you must be born
[46:13] again to be a Christian amen right
[46:16] become a new
[46:20] creature the old man's got to be dead to
[46:23] be a new creature right
[46:27] I I love the story The Prophet told
[46:29] about the man you know that killed the
[46:31] the the King's son or what it was there
[46:34] you
[46:34] know you come down to see him and they
[46:37] wouldn't even feeding the guy they
[46:38] wouldn't doing anything cuz he killed
[46:39] the King's
[46:43] son he asked him said why don't you kill
[46:46] him he said well in the fit of rage I'm
[46:49] sorry he walks out you remember the
[46:52] story he sent him back down there with
[46:55] clothes and and everything to wash him
[46:57] up clean him up
[46:59] right to destroy all of his records
[47:07] amen and bring him out so now you're my
[47:11] son amen put the robe on him you're my
[47:14] son amen yes sir you know what that King
[47:17] was actually saying absolutely he was
[47:19] saying that my son that I had and
[47:22] fathered and raised up and you killed no
[47:24] longer exist right MH thank you
[47:29] Lord come on think about it that's
[47:31] that's the way I think of the story yes
[47:34] sir my son no longer
[47:37] exist records of my son have been
[47:40] destroyed records of your life has been
[47:45] destroyed not I that liveth but Christ
[47:47] that liveth in me
[47:49] amen a new
[47:54] creation Romans 6 and2 he says that we'
[47:58] got to be dead to
[48:02] sin that's
[48:04] right you ever do anything wrong Brother
[48:07] D every
[48:10] day brother randam do you sin every day
[48:13] he said every
[48:15] day now you got to explain
[48:20] sin why because that's the way people
[48:22] run with
[48:23] it they don't think about what a man is
[48:26] saying was brother around him saying
[48:28] that he disbelieved God's
[48:30] word no but he done explain that the
[48:33] only sin that there is is to disbelieve
[48:35] God's
[48:39] word is that true right amen but yet he
[48:43] said he sinned every
[48:47] day so there must be something about Sin
[48:49] that we don't
[48:53] understand he said it's not a sin that
[48:55] drinks run around all these other
[49:01] things but he said if we don't repent
[49:03] we're going to have to answer for them
[49:05] that's right
[49:09] right so you're going to have to answer
[49:11] for him as a record
[49:18] kept you know what that means if a
[49:22] record is kept against me I'm not dead
[49:24] right
[49:28] see so
[49:32] right I'm not dead if a record is
[49:37] kept well don't you think you make
[49:39] mistake yes I do but brother R said when
[49:41] a Christian makes a mistakes he said he
[49:43] immediately says I'm sorry
[49:46] right how would you like this quote he
[49:50] said you say you're sorry he said and it
[49:52] never
[49:54] was
[49:56] yep
[49:57] accounted right y because God knew you
[50:00] was going to say you're sorry
[50:06] mhm amen that's how pure it is am right
[50:10] sir how about one I've got it in and
[50:12] probably get to it later with
[50:15] it how about one where that God sees you
[50:18] when you're born
[50:20] again you know how brother around said
[50:22] God seen you when you were born
[50:24] again
[50:27] he said he seen
[50:29] you just exactly
[50:31] like that he saw you before the world
[50:34] Amen that's right that's it
[50:40] MH now that's how beautiful a Christian
[50:43] is
[50:45] amen he sees you just like he saw you
[50:47] before the world
[50:50] Amen when a lamb was stood and slain mhm
[50:54] to cover everything can be taken care
[50:58] of see what it means to be a new
[51:05] creature not the old creation made
[51:08] over 2 Corinthians 5:17 the new creature
[51:12] all things have become
[51:18] new now how a man could be see right if
[51:23] he's alive it's not new right
[51:26] but if he
[51:30] died to me the best way to to do a a a
[51:33] point of what we'll be thinking about I
[51:35] know it's carnal but there's such a word
[51:38] as we call it
[51:41] Amnesia and something happens you get
[51:43] hit or something and you just forget
[51:45] everything wouldn't it be
[51:48] great right amen wouldn't it be great if
[51:51] that could happen right now right amen
[51:54] and you know what I'd be glad to take
[51:55] the hit on the head y right if you just
[51:59] make sure it worked I don't want the hit
[52:02] on the head and it not
[52:04] work the
[52:07] Amnesia yep you
[52:10] know we you don't
[52:12] remember see then all things has become
[52:15] new if it's never corrected which
[52:18] generally is you know true time and
[52:19] things happening it's gener corrected
[52:21] but if it never was corrected you know
[52:24] what you have a total new
[52:30] identity
[52:32] amen would that be something sure
[52:35] absolutely
[52:37] amen well you know that's what God done
[52:39] for us sure right that's right by giving
[52:42] us a new birth thank you Lord
[52:44] amen give us a total new
[52:50] identity amen let's just read a
[52:54] few
[53:03] I got a whole bunch in here I got 21 I
[53:05] think it is and some of them's got about
[53:08] six
[53:09] paragraphs all right so uh you just take
[53:12] them home read them we'll get back to it
[53:15] look what brother Brown said about us on
[53:17] the token
[53:18] 1964 uh 308 1964 of the token now the
[53:24] promises make free from sin CHS that God
[53:27] hasn't hasn't recognized your
[53:30] sin David said all right
[53:33] listen blessed is a man to whom God will
[53:36] not impute sin
[53:37] too and God will never impute sin over
[53:40] that token because the token is the paid
[53:42] price that God has already received it
[53:45] and you got a token for it the your
[53:47] faith has bought it amen and you have
[53:50] the purchased price of your redemption
[53:53] in your body mhm to worship him and show
[53:56] forth his promises and power see it even
[53:59] comes out into the body course you bring
[54:03] the body under subjection you begin to
[54:04] let the man die look at the next
[54:06] one this is the serpent seed 1958 9:28
[54:11] the evening
[54:13] service did not David say blessed is the
[54:16] man to whom God will not reckon sin and
[54:19] impute sin too God don't hold a sin
[54:22] against this
[54:24] creature I gave you that one the other
[54:26] night but I wanted to read it again this
[54:30] creature he doesn't reckon sin to the
[54:33] righteous
[54:35] right now who's righteous none of us Jes
[54:39] right
[54:40] amen none of us is righteous amen right
[54:45] that's right but God is righteous so if
[54:47] God's living in
[54:50] you then he makes you righteous right
[54:53] see let me let me explain something
[54:56] right
[54:58] there does he make you
[55:03] righteous now watch we'll get on down
[55:06] here in a little bit you understand
[55:07] reason I'm saying this does he make you
[55:09] righteous because you ain't careful
[55:11] you'll have something there you begin to
[55:12] try to work something with it and you'll
[55:14] try to take the old ways and try to make
[55:16] something I does he make you righteous
[55:19] or does he impart his righteousness
[55:21] right now which one is it amen that's
[55:24] see now if he gives his own
[55:25] righteousness is not making you
[55:27] righteous
[55:30] right he's not making you
[55:34] righteous he's imparting his
[55:36] righteousness to you right right
[55:39] amen that way then you become righteous
[55:42] right
[55:46] sure but see if you ain't careful you'll
[55:48] say he made
[55:50] me see then you get your big self in the
[55:53] way well look what I had something to do
[55:55] with it cuz he made me no no no no no
[55:58] all he wants you and I is to die amen
[56:02] that's right if we die he can live amen
[56:06] he died that we might live amen amen
[56:09] that's all he
[56:16] asked now look what he says we're going
[56:18] to get a good bit of reading here in the
[56:21] minute off for some of
[56:23] this oh we read this in in Revelation
[56:29] 34 that is the beginning of the creation
[56:31] of God look what he says
[56:33] 336 of the church age
[56:40] book now he's but now he is standing in
[56:44] the midst of the
[56:45] church as he stands there revealing
[56:51] us
[56:53] Noe see that we still like
[56:58] it but if you read it right he'll get to
[57:01] us
[57:04] right but just remember that he comes
[57:06] before to us
[57:08] amen is that maybe I'm crazy
[57:12] but as he stands there revealing who he
[57:16] is in this last age he calls himself the
[57:20] author of the creation of
[57:23] God this is another creation Now want
[57:30] you this has to do with the church
[57:35] yeah but who is the
[57:38] church this is a special designation of
[57:41] himself
[57:45] right so it's not you and
[57:48] I it's him right right he is the creator
[57:54] of that church
[57:55] now watch what he describes CU see then
[57:57] you come right back and watch him this
[57:59] has to do with the church this is this
[58:01] is another creation and then he jumps
[58:04] right down and explains what he comes in
[58:05] and how it takes place see watch The
[58:07] Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[58:09] bride
[58:11] amen now as the spirit of
[58:17] God no
[58:19] yep as the spirit of God he came down
[58:22] and created in the Virgin Mary the cells
[58:25] from which his body was
[58:28] born he's either got to be making that
[58:30] that as a personal point to tie together
[58:33] or they should have shoved that down and
[58:35] made another
[58:38] paragraph cuz it looks like he just
[58:41] changed
[58:43] thoughts I'm not no English major but I
[58:46] know one thing when you change thoughts
[58:47] you change paragraphs
[58:52] right that's a sensible way of looking
[58:54] in
[58:56] English but he ties it all
[58:59] together and gives you the
[59:02] conclusion Sal from which his body was
[59:04] born I want to repeat that he created
[59:06] the very s in the wound of Mary for that
[59:08] body it was not enough for that the Holy
[59:11] Spirit to Simply give life to a human
[59:13] over him supplied by Mary that would
[59:15] have been sinful mankind producing a
[59:18] body that's right now watch even if the
[59:21] Holy Spirit gave birth to what Mary was
[59:23] doing it would be a sinful body you read
[59:25] it come on Sir amen that would not have
[59:27] produced the LI Adam of him it was said
[59:31] l a body thou had thou
[59:34] father prepared for
[59:37] me God not Mary provided that body Mary
[59:40] was the human incubator and she carried
[59:42] the holy child and brought him to birth
[59:44] it was a God man he was the son of God
[59:46] he was of the new creation
[59:49] right man and God met remember the other
[59:52] week Heaven and Earth kissed each other
[59:55] other righteousness and peace all right
[59:58] man and God met and joined he was the
[1:00:00] first of this new race he is the head of
[1:00:02] this new race and he tells you who that
[1:00:03] is that's Colossians 1:18 and he is the
[1:00:07] head of the body the church who is the
[1:00:09] beginning the first born from the dead
[1:00:10] that in all things he might have the
[1:00:11] preeminence 2 Corinthians
[1:00:14] 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:00:16] he is a new creation old things have
[1:00:19] passed away behold all things are become
[1:00:21] new there you can see that though man
[1:00:24] was of the old order or creation Now in
[1:00:27] Union with Christ he has become a
[1:00:30] new become the new creation of God right
[1:00:33] Ephesians 2:10 for we are his
[1:00:35] workmanship created in Union with Christ
[1:00:37] Jesus under good works Ephesians 4:20
[1:00:40] and that you put on the new man which
[1:00:42] after God is created in righteousness
[1:00:44] and true Holiness this new creation is
[1:00:47] not the old creation made over or it
[1:00:49] could not be called a new creation this
[1:00:52] is exactly what it says it is new
[1:00:54] creation it is another creation distinct
[1:00:57] from the old one no longer is he dealing
[1:01:00] by ways of the flesh that was how he
[1:01:02] dealt with Israel he chose Abraham of
[1:01:05] Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac
[1:01:07] line but now out of ever Kindred tribe
[1:01:10] and Nation he has purposed a new
[1:01:12] creation right he is the first of that
[1:01:14] creation he was God created in the form
[1:01:17] of Man by his Spirit he is creating many
[1:01:20] sons unto himself God the Creator
[1:01:23] creating himself a part of his
[1:01:25] creation not another
[1:01:28] creation special designation of itself
[1:01:31] is right where we started
[1:01:32] at who is this new
[1:01:35] creation what possibility does a human
[1:01:38] being have of being a new creation right
[1:01:41] by dying to accept and accepting Jesus
[1:01:44] Christ
[1:01:45] right by the new birth right the only
[1:01:48] way it can be done what did he
[1:01:51] say he talking about church God body
[1:01:55] right right come on you reading all the
[1:01:58] way down you got it in front of you take
[1:01:59] home read it reading done
[1:02:03] it he's talking about himself he's
[1:02:05] talking about his church he's talking
[1:02:07] about what the church is the church is
[1:02:09] him not another person not another
[1:02:12] creation it's the same creation now look
[1:02:15] what he says this is a true revelation
[1:02:17] of
[1:02:19] God what is the true revelation of
[1:02:23] God
[1:02:26] that God by him coming into human flesh
[1:02:29] made way that he could by being the
[1:02:32] beginning of the creation of God Amen
[1:02:34] that he could become into you and I
[1:02:37] right and brother Rand said we'll get to
[1:02:39] it in just a minute where he said
[1:02:41] it he's the with the rest of that
[1:02:45] creation
[1:02:48] right look the true revelation of God
[1:02:53] what that's why we're not Oneness man
[1:02:57] Oneness is that Jesus was the life form
[1:02:59] of
[1:03:01] God no the Bride of Jesus Christ is the
[1:03:04] life form of God Amen that's right then
[1:03:07] there be a dispensational change goes to
[1:03:09] Israel right they'll be the light form
[1:03:12] but right here in this Gentile
[1:03:15] dispensation we're part of the
[1:03:17] Revelation right a special designation
[1:03:20] if you read it off the face of himself y
[1:03:23] That's Right not you and I why cuz we're
[1:03:31] dead come on we're
[1:03:35] dead if we're dead we can be a part of
[1:03:38] the new creation but if we're still
[1:03:42] alive his death didn't do anything for
[1:03:44] us this is the true revelation of God
[1:03:47] this was his purpose this purpose took
[1:03:49] form through election that is why he
[1:03:51] could look right down to the last age
[1:03:53] where all would be over and when all
[1:03:56] would be over and see himself still in
[1:03:58] the midst of the church as author of
[1:04:00] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[1:04:03] power brought it to pip by his own
[1:04:05] decree he elected the members of his new
[1:04:10] creation
[1:04:14] right 38 brother we had to pull this in
[1:04:18] now he's got to come up to pick up
[1:04:20] another one it's 3A on the back of your
[1:04:23] thing right proven his word

[1:04:31] beginning of the
[1:04:33] creation of God this is the
[1:04:36] continuation of the creation of God
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:41] y then the whole world whole earth

[1:13:13] world now that's where we stop always do
[1:13:16] it because of just
[1:13:18] honest you take that statement right
[1:13:20] there and and every one of us is said in
[1:13:23] this bu is going to die and go to hell
[1:13:28] right right oh you talk like that
[1:13:32] brother well have you done anything
[1:13:34] worldly
[1:13:35] today I mean did you
[1:13:38] eat did you take a
[1:13:41] bath did you drive the
[1:13:45] church all those things are worldly
[1:13:49] right but now are they worldly of the
[1:13:52] point of world
[1:13:57] worldly come on are you thinking is that
[1:14:00] worldly to take a bath I think I hope
[1:14:04] everybody does it sure smells better
[1:14:09] amen amen amen that saying is you know
[1:14:13] cleaning is next to God that's not in
[1:14:15] the Bible what good
[1:14:16] saying
[1:14:18] but what is he talking about dead to the
[1:14:21] world right
[1:14:25] mhm is it wrong to live is it wrong to
[1:14:28] work make money have
[1:14:31] families enjoy life is that what he's
[1:14:34] talking about no
[1:14:40] no Jesus Christ lived ate slept done all
[1:14:43] the things was that
[1:14:46] worldly that's what I mean see we we get
[1:14:48] those things in there and then we we
[1:14:50] Shuffle it down and sometimes we can't
[1:14:52] understand and we say well are we
[1:14:56] worldly we're not worldly for
[1:14:59] living now if we make it worldly right
[1:15:02] right that's right
[1:15:04] MH see then you have to determine what's
[1:15:08] life and what's worldly
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:15] right the story was told of JC
[1:15:21] penies did used to go to church and used
[1:15:23] to tith and used to do all the
[1:15:26] things need to slow down cuz he got so
[1:15:28] big got so many businesses and
[1:15:32] places so the preacher finally went to
[1:15:34] see him Pastor
[1:15:36] did he said well I've just been so busy
[1:15:38] he said I can't I just can't serve the
[1:15:40] Lord I'm so busy you know doing this and
[1:15:43] all these new buildings and all these
[1:15:44] new things and no preacher said well
[1:15:46] okay let's pray and I'll leave he got
[1:15:49] down and he said Lord Mr penny is just
[1:15:51] too busy said would you you burn down a
[1:15:53] bunch of his
[1:15:55] stores and make a crash on everything
[1:15:58] and get him
[1:16:00] busted the preacher said he felt a hand
[1:16:02] reach over on him said I got the
[1:16:08] message right nothing wrong being
[1:16:11] worldly the turno which was the big
[1:16:13] tractor place or what you call a big
[1:16:15] machinery that was up here at TCO it was
[1:16:18] you know made all kind of heavy
[1:16:20] equipment the story was told of him said
[1:16:22] he started out giving
[1:16:25] 10% said he decided to
[1:16:28] okay I'll just see what'll
[1:16:30] happen he just set up in his
[1:16:33] tithe he wound up giving
[1:16:37] 90% he couldn't spend what he had
[1:16:42] left now is that
[1:16:48] worldly JC penage was worldly when he
[1:16:50] went into the world and wouldn't go to
[1:16:52] church right and wouldn't pay his TI and
[1:16:54] keep up with serving the lord that was
[1:16:56] worldly right that's right amen right
[1:16:59] amen true so now we're distinguishing
[1:17:06] worldly but what does it mean
[1:17:12] worldly there nothing wrong with living
[1:17:14] in life enjoying life that's right as
[1:17:17] long as we don't let life rule us right
[1:17:19] righten when we let life rule us it's
[1:17:22] worldly
[1:17:24] no matter what it is eating too
[1:17:26] much
[1:17:32] fat but you see what see when I when I
[1:17:35] come across this I think what is the
[1:17:36] people
[1:17:37] thinking right the brother brand said we
[1:17:40] we we're not
[1:17:44] worly you don't think that way when you
[1:17:46] read some things he stay he says you
[1:17:49] know Church we're just not worly let's
[1:17:52] go and get hamburger when to get through
[1:17:54] I'll meet you down here we we'll go
[1:17:56] we're going hunting tomorrow we're
[1:17:57] leaving out going going to California I
[1:18:00] mean going to Colorado going to be gone
[1:18:01] hunting two
[1:18:07] weeks well brother Brown I sounds like
[1:18:12] whirlings
[1:18:14] no because Jesus told his disciples come
[1:18:19] aside and rest sure you remember
[1:18:24] right because they we're tired worn out
[1:18:27] been preaching going come aside and
[1:18:30] rest nothing wrong with life so when he
[1:18:32] talking about world what's he talking
[1:18:34] about when he talking about Sin what's
[1:18:36] brother R talking about when he's
[1:18:37] talking about Sin and he said he sinned
[1:18:40] every day but then said sin is to
[1:18:41] disbelieve the word brother you disbel
[1:18:43] the word every day now we try to prop
[1:18:45] that up with some kind of a way just be
[1:18:48] honest about it there's a little word
[1:18:51] sin the Bible says there's a sin not
[1:18:54] under death right
[1:18:57] amen but there is a sin under
[1:19:01] death then we don't even pray for
[1:19:08] it you see where me as a pastor I try to
[1:19:11] look down and see what people are
[1:19:15] thinking try to get what's what's on
[1:19:18] your
[1:19:20] mind it's not a sin of us to to live and
[1:19:23] be life and enjoy life right that's
[1:19:26] right but when we go
[1:19:28] overboard then we're turning it in to a
[1:19:31] point of turning down God's word right
[1:19:33] forsake not your sing yourselves
[1:19:35] together is God's word that's right
[1:19:37] that's just as much now brother Bram
[1:19:39] never
[1:19:40] said that's going to be a good one
[1:19:43] brother R never
[1:19:45] said that assing failing to assemble
[1:19:47] yourself to church you know is not
[1:19:50] sin they said drinking G and smoking EXA
[1:19:53] running around he said that's not sin
[1:19:54] right right but show me where he ever
[1:19:56] said failing to assemble your together
[1:19:58] was
[1:19:59] sin no he know that see that that's
[1:20:02] right amen he didn't have to make it
[1:20:04] right right don't that's her
[1:20:07] choice if you don't
[1:20:11] understand I've always told you I wonder
[1:20:13] what
[1:20:15] happened if you come up here one night
[1:20:17] and and I wouldn't
[1:20:20] hear well brother son
[1:20:26] home home
[1:20:29] yeah okay pull it back up brother
[1:20:33] amen pull let back up cuz we're not
[1:20:38] through marriage of the
[1:20:41] Lamb number five can you pull it back up
[1:20:44] takes them a while in our jugle the
[1:20:46] books
[1:20:47] okay but look what he said then the
[1:20:50] world is dead then we are no more care
[1:20:51] for the world yeah the world is dead to
[1:20:53] us and we're and it's dead to us and
[1:20:55] we're dead to
[1:20:56] it you're a different person different
[1:20:59] personality because you're a new
[1:21:00] creation right different
[1:21:03] personality creation not the same
[1:21:06] creation polished up right not a a man
[1:21:09] that's turned a new Leaf but a man
[1:21:12] that's dead and been born again and
[1:21:14] become a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:21:16] and the spirit of the Living God lives
[1:21:18] in the person
[1:21:20] right think on these things let's get
[1:21:23] one more I told him we were going to try
[1:21:25] to make it to eight but we won't make it
[1:21:27] down to number
[1:21:29] eight look at the next from
[1:21:31] 1962 uh 621 which would be confirmation
[1:21:35] and
[1:21:37] evidence now I feel religious why we are
[1:21:41] dead and our lives is hid in God through
[1:21:43] Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost I
[1:21:45] look back and see where I once was that
[1:21:48] William Bram died 32 years ago there and
[1:21:53] now we are a new creation in Christ
[1:21:56] already raised with him set with him now
[1:21:58] in Heavenly places with the authority of
[1:22:01] his promised word that ever devil shall
[1:22:03] be subject to us and nothing shall in
[1:22:06] any wise in other words right going down
[1:22:08] get an excellent Richard let's go the
[1:22:11] token 1963 11:28 the evening service
[1:22:15] paragraph
[1:22:19] 183 but when really the product
[1:22:23] the new life of Jesus Christ comes into
[1:22:26] a man or woman he is a new creation the
[1:22:29] old man is dead he is finished he's done
[1:22:33] that token must always display all right
[1:22:37] let's get to the last one on number
[1:22:38] eight then we'll
[1:22:39] quit Christianity versus idolatry 19611
[1:22:44] 1217 if you haven't been baptized in the
[1:22:46] name of Jesus Christ there's a pool full
[1:22:50] of water here and when you raise up out
[1:22:52] of that water you're rising to walk with
[1:22:55] Christ in a new life you are dead then
[1:22:59] you are no more temper and everything is
[1:23:03] everything's gone away You're New
[1:23:05] Creation in Christ then he raises you up
[1:23:09] by the Holy Ghost and sets you in
[1:23:10] Heavenly places with himself far above
[1:23:13] all powers and of this world right so
[1:23:16] keep the rest of those it'll be on the
[1:23:18] new creation when we get back to it CU
[1:23:20] we ain't got the time but listen
[1:23:24] church I'm just honestly trying to talk
[1:23:26] to all of
[1:23:29] us but if you take a line like a lot of
[1:23:31] people think on something that's run a
[1:23:33] line across you're going to condemn
[1:23:34] every one of
[1:23:36] us I mean there's no hopes of any in
[1:23:38] individual
[1:23:39] nowhere on the line of what most people
[1:23:42] call Sin what people most people call
[1:23:45] you know
[1:23:47] whism I've had people to condemn me for
[1:23:50] deer
[1:23:51] hunting that's worthy
[1:23:54] ISM well is
[1:23:58] it yeah that's all I do right yeah right
[1:24:03] that's
[1:24:04] right that's where is that's all I do
[1:24:07] you know in other words I let that stand
[1:24:09] in between me and the Lord
[1:24:14] right that's why when we go
[1:24:17] hunting you know and we've had to miss
[1:24:20] times because we had to where we'd be
[1:24:23] but 99.9% of the time we're in church
[1:24:26] when the services wrong that's right not
[1:24:28] me I didn't call we even tried to find
[1:24:31] the church and we couldn't find nothing
[1:24:32] I said go down to the Catholics I ain't
[1:24:34] never been to M I ain't making a joke
[1:24:37] out of it I I ain't never been let's
[1:24:40] find us a Catholic church we'll go in
[1:24:42] and sit down wouldn't make fun of them
[1:24:44] make no lie to them ain't never been
[1:24:48] there want to go to
[1:24:51] church I felt bad all day Sunday yeah
[1:24:55] why because we our church that's right
[1:24:59] that's I mean that's just
[1:25:01] true and I'm not a legalist on that
[1:25:05] point but I am one
[1:25:09] thing I love God's people and I love to
[1:25:11] fellowship with you and to be with you
[1:25:14] and to get together and sit
[1:25:17] around what's wrong with that is that
[1:25:21] worldly
[1:25:24] I mean we gather together and we
[1:25:25] Fellowship of Christmas we do it for for
[1:25:28] Easter we do it for for uh Valentine's
[1:25:31] Day we do it for and is that
[1:25:39] worldly if it is where's your
[1:25:45] spirituality I just mean that
[1:25:47] obviously does it make us more spiritual
[1:25:50] because we don't do these things
[1:25:54] what is world
[1:26:00] is see we condemn everybody in the
[1:26:04] world all things I do you don't do now
[1:26:08] listen I believe brother random was an
[1:26:10] image don't you amen
[1:26:13] sir but you take check the dates on the
[1:26:17] tapes and see how many days between the
[1:26:20] dates that he preached that he wasn't
[1:26:24] preaching and sometimes it'll be two
[1:26:26] weeks sometimes it'll be almost a month
[1:26:29] that you won't hard to have any
[1:26:34] services but the man was wore
[1:26:37] out he had to get alone absolutely
[1:26:42] amen he said I'm out there said said you
[1:26:45] see this but he said it's nothing he
[1:26:47] said when I'm out there that's when he's
[1:26:49] speaking to me he said I'm out there
[1:26:51] filling up
[1:26:53] but I do like what a lady over in South
[1:26:55] Carolina one time her husband said
[1:26:56] brother Brown went hunting to get out of
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:00] spirit you know to go help him you know
[1:27:03] in life she said honey you don't need to
[1:27:06] get out of the
[1:27:09] spirit so that's good
[1:27:12] point cuz you can take that and make it
[1:27:15] wor is
[1:27:18] right but what is
[1:27:21] sin what is
[1:27:25] death just dying out to ourselves and
[1:27:28] letting him live that's
[1:27:29] right the de I can get and listen this
[1:27:32] old boy got a lot of problems I'm a
[1:27:39] human but I try to keep him under the
[1:27:41] blood right right that's
[1:27:45] it and I try to pray for
[1:27:48] you and myself every day over and over
[1:27:51] and over
[1:27:53] amen wake up in the middle of the night
[1:27:55] and just start praying I said well San
[1:27:58] you wake me up you going to hear me talk
[1:28:00] to the Lord and I go back to sleep
[1:28:02] that's right right you know after a
[1:28:04] while he begin he won't wake you up too
[1:28:06] much so some of you that's got what is
[1:28:09] that a word inia what is it can't sleep
[1:28:11] right if you can't sleep start praying
[1:28:13] for me that's right there you go and
[1:28:15] I'll guarantee you you'll fall asleep in
[1:28:17] just a few
[1:28:19] minutes that's true right
[1:28:23] cuz Satan ain't going to let you do much
[1:28:26] praying so just keep praying you say
[1:28:28] well I stayed awake all night my wife
[1:28:30] told I've stayed awake all night all
[1:28:32] right
[1:28:34] pray maybe that's what God wants you to
[1:28:37] do that's
[1:28:39] right right right yeah just stay away
[1:28:43] and
[1:28:45] pray maybe he's using you to pray for
[1:28:48] somebody that's right maybe he's
[1:28:50] interceding through you amen
[1:28:52] yes sir that's what brother Al used to
[1:28:54] tell me he said wake up at 3:00 said I
[1:28:56] pray for you I said Lord wake him up at
[1:28:58] 1 you know a couple hours
[1:29:03] extra
[1:29:05] that's amen why can't we be that
[1:29:08] way I don't let the devil get credit for
[1:29:13] anything brother Neville I remember what
[1:29:15] happened come on brother mus this
[1:29:17] brother Neville he failed and U I got to
[1:29:20] hear him preach one time we did when was

[1:29:31] him he said no way in the world that
[1:29:33] wouldn't he said that wouldn't the
[1:29:38] devil he said that's the Lord said I'm
[1:29:41] just getting out too far said he needed
[1:29:44] me to slow down where to

[1:29:50] back let's qu ring on the devil right

[1:30:04] honest no it's the devil always brother
[1:30:07] Dale with me yeah okay all
[1:30:11] right but what about a new
[1:30:14] creature to have a new birth you must
[1:30:17] die right for us to get a change of the
[1:30:21] body so somebody's going to come to a
[1:30:24] place that we're going to be dead to
[1:30:28] ourselves and alive in Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ and then God will change the
[1:30:38] body a new creation this is this age
[1:30:41] this is the age of the new creation
[1:30:43] because it goes if you understood what I
[1:30:45] far it goes from the new birth in this
[1:30:48] age to the change of the body right to
[1:30:51] the change of the world
[1:30:54] yes Amen in this age yep that's right no
[1:30:59] other age could ever do that let's stand
[1:31:00] together that's right there was no way
