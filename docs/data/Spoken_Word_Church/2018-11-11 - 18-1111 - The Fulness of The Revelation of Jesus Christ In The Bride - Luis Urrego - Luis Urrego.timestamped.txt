[0:00] Chris so it makes some double nerves
[0:02] yeah just pray for him huh
[0:05] that's that's why yeah I'm trying to get
[0:07] in the habit of sitting up front at
[0:12] least every other service especially
[0:14] when these other ministers when the
[0:16] other ministers come in a minister
[0:18] because uh you know it really helps to
[0:21] have other ministers up from work
[0:23] it really does for support it's just my
[0:26] brother Dale might be different because
[0:27] I mean he's a veteran either the you

[1:48] leave Saturday Oh
[2:00] wherever that gone okay all right well
[2:05] this morning uh kind of maybe is this is
[2:09] sort of like a little introduction of
[2:11] what I'm really wanting to speak about
[2:12] Lord willing Wednesday and but I got to
[2:17] tell you everything that brother Dale
[2:20] and brother Wade has been bringing out
[2:22] lately has been so so good to me I don't
[2:24] know about you but for me it's been
[2:28] expended I open it it's you know just
[2:34] the Lord just wanting to reveal and
[2:36] wanted to really understand who we are
[2:40] you know as a people we're not just here
[2:44] just to be here or just to come to
[2:46] church or just to you know fill in a Pew
[2:50] we're here to manifest Jesus Christ in
[2:53] this out right and you can't manifest
[2:57] Jesus Christ without the word being
[2:58] involved right you have to have the word
[3:01] being involved in so I've really really
[3:05] really appreciate it because every time
[3:06] anything that has to do with that cap
[3:09] that capstone the headstone cornerstone
[3:12] I love those topics I love those topics
[3:16] and and so it's really impressed me and
[3:19] so I was telling my wife you know I go
[3:23] back and I listen or I just I reflect or
[3:26] look at notes that I messaging they're
[3:29] not preached in the last year the last
[3:32] two years
[3:33] in the last three years even here and
[3:37] and I see how God is helping helping us
[3:41] grow you know and then I go back and and
[3:45] sometimes you just go back and you kind
[3:47] of you look at something like wow I
[3:49] thought that was great at the time but
[3:52] now when you look at it again and you
[3:54] realize what God has given you right now
[3:56] and you look at those notes and those
[3:58] things like that it's like it just opens
[4:00] up even more you know and so I got over
[4:04] there and probably probably attest to
[4:06] that and so so but I want to look at
[4:11] this here if we're reading Colossians
[4:14] chapter 1 and we want to talk about you
[4:24] know the secrets of God and the secret
[4:27] of God and also a little bit maybe about
[4:31] the importance of Revelation but I don't
[4:32] want to get too much too much of ahead
[4:35] of myself because I want to leave a lot
[4:38] a lot of up for Wednesdays Colossians
[4:41] chapter 1 it says verse 21 says in you
[4:44] that were sometime alienated and enemies
[4:46] in your mind by wicked works yet now
[4:49] have he reconciled in the body of his
[4:52] flesh through death to present you holy
[4:54] and unblameable and Unruh provable in
[4:57] his sight I want you to that's how God
[5:01] sees you unblameable Unruh provable holy
[5:06] in his sight yeah we have such a hard
[5:09] time seeing ourselves that way because
[5:12] we make mistakes we fall we do we think
[5:15] we failed him every single day and we
[5:17] have to repent everything right but yet
[5:19] Paul is saying that this is how God sees
[5:22] us so we need to start exercising
[5:24] because if you don't see yourself this
[5:26] way you're not going to be exercised
[5:28] you're not going to exercise the word
[5:30] that you have to manifest in this hour
[5:32] with confidence yes right you have to
[5:35] recognize yourself this way we have to
[5:37] recognize ourselves this way hmm if you
[5:41] continue in the faith grounded and
[5:43] settled and be not moved away from the
[5:46] hope of the gospel which ye have heard
[5:49] in which was preached to every creature
[5:51] which is under heaven
[5:53] well I Paul and made a minister now that
[5:57] tells me right there that there you can
[6:00] be moved away I mean there's a pup house
[6:04] putting that possibility yes we've seen
[6:07] it in this our people who we thought who
[6:09] who probably loved probably said I love
[6:12] this message there's nothing better than
[6:14] this message 40 years into it and now
[6:17] they're moved away now they don't even
[6:20] they preached it let's just stay with
[6:22] the word and they don't know where to
[6:24] take the people there you know so kind
[6:28] of leaving people hanging so you have to
[6:33] work your own salvation with fear and
[6:34] trembling the Bible says every single
[6:36] day don't get confident don't get stale
[6:39] do not do pay attention to what God is
[6:45] trying to do in this out all you may
[6:47] have heard you may have heard the
[6:49] message and headstone now probably
[6:51] hundreds of times brother they'll may be
[6:53] speaking about it something it you still
[6:56] because we're still here the
[6:58] resurrection hasn't still taken place
[7:00] there's still something that we're not
[7:02] getting
[7:03] right it has to become a revelation it
[7:07] has to be something personal to you amen
[7:13] and the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[7:14] vast it's in layers and we'll discuss
[7:19] more about that maybe just a little bit
[7:21] but maybe Wednesday will bring something
[7:23] out amen
[7:24] maybe you might might help you
[7:26] understand it a little better or proper
[7:29] something well visuals to me helps me
[7:39] and so especially when we're turning
[7:41] we're preaching to a mixed congregation
[7:44] young people everybody I want everybody
[7:47] to try to get what I'm trying to say you
[7:49] see and and so I think I like visuals
[7:55] praise the Lord so if you continue in
[7:58] the faith grounded and settle and be not
[8:00] moved away from the hope of the gospel
[8:02] which ye have heard and which was
[8:04] preached to every creature which is
[8:06] under heaven where a by pollen made a
[8:08] minister who now rejoice in my
[8:10] sufferings for you and fill up that
[8:12] which is behind of the afflictions of
[8:15] Christ in my flesh for his body sick
[8:17] which is the church where I am made a
[8:19] minister according to the dispensation
[8:21] of God which is given to me for you to
[8:23] fulfill the Word of God even the mystery
[8:27] which have been hid from ages and from
[8:29] generations but now is made manifest to
[8:33] his Saints amen this is now made
[8:36] manifest today remember in Revelation
[8:39] chapter 1 it says the the revelation of
[8:42] Jesus Christ which God gave to him right
[8:46] now we part of that body of Christ or
[8:49] are we not part of that body of Christ
[8:51] we're we're we're own of his bone flesh
[8:54] of his flesh flesh life of his life when
[8:57] he was here on earth we were in him amen
[9:00] not you know not physically but we were
[9:04] part of that eternal life that he had
[9:06] remember remember he was the fullness of
[9:08] the Godhead bodily be welded involved in
[9:10] but yeah yeah even brother Prem says
[9:15] this Jesus Christ did not even know all
[9:18] things he did not know all things
[9:21] because remember even at Mount
[9:23] Transfiguration when he went to the
[9:24] Mount Transfiguration Elijah and Moses
[9:28] there wrecked one references
[9:29] representing the the the word the 10
[9:32] commandments amen the law and then
[9:35] largely represented the prophets right
[9:37] they were discussing what were they
[9:39] discussed about the second coming of the
[9:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[9:44] that's what brother Branham said because
[9:47] Jesus Christ wasn't made manifest to
[9:49] hear me and then even though he had the
[9:51] fullness of the Godhead bodily Bullock
[9:53] he had all of God dwelling in him he was
[9:56] God right yet he still didn't know and
[10:00] so in revelation 1 it says that the
[10:03] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[10:04] gave to him now I believe it came to him
[10:08] in layers as well humanly speaking his
[10:13] human part right because remember the
[10:16] life that he lived we also have to live
[10:19] as a Christian if where he was the son
[10:22] of man here right we have to manifest
[10:25] the Son of Man as well and we get it by
[10:28] layers just as he got it by layers as
[10:30] well right
[10:32] so now I wasn't the brother branham was
[10:35] the one who said that he didn't know all
[10:37] things and we
[10:39] they will read something about that amen
[10:44] in that side he grows in Christ they
[10:47] grow in grace and knowledge that's
[10:48] exactly right
[10:49] sure did does he know sometimes we think
[10:52] that he he everything built in him and
[10:54] that he knew everything yeah he knew
[10:57] what God wanted him to know that's right
[11:00] all right
[11:01] same thing with brother like our prophet
[11:02] of this day know all things only what
[11:06] God wanted him to know that we needed to
[11:08] know right thing that we needed all
[11:11] right two persons that the moon god
[11:14] would make known what is the riches of
[11:16] the glory of this mystery among the
[11:18] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[11:22] of glory when we preach warning every
[11:26] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[11:28] that we may present every man perfect in
[11:32] Christ Jesus you this is Christ has been
[11:35] a mystery to the further throughout all
[11:37] the ages for the people amen but in this
[11:41] last day amen
[11:43] there has to be that son of man ministry
[11:45] to unfold amongst the bride in this hour
[11:49] right remember of the braids been taco
[11:51] by the weights been talking about that
[11:53] son of man Minister that little work
[11:55] that's coming in at the end time it is
[11:58] that's gonna take place amen and that's
[12:01] the Bride of Christ in this hour because
[12:04] remember that resurrection has to take
[12:07] place we're not gonna leave here without
[12:10] that resurrection amen
[12:12] I'm looking for a resurrection amen
[12:15] praise the Lord now in Ephesians chapter
[12:18] 3 verse 4 says whereby when you read you
[12:21] may understand my knowledge in the
[12:23] mystery of Christ which another ages was
[12:26] not made known unto the sons of men as
[12:28] it is now revealed unto his holy
[12:32] apostles and prophets by the spirit amen
[12:37] that the Gentile should be fellow heirs
[12:40] and of the same body and partakers of
[12:44] his promise in Christ by the gospel so
[12:47] here's Paul is reiterating the fact that
[12:49] your heirs and joiners with you whatever
[12:54] he got is what you will get the Bride of
[12:57] Christ will get because why he's the
[13:01] head and we are the body that follows
[13:03] sister Lisa's head as part of sister
[13:06] Lisa's body and when her head moves her
[13:09] body doesn't do something totally
[13:10] different I mean I guess it could but I
[13:17] mean you know her body wants to follow
[13:19] in the direction of the head right and
[13:22] that's exactly what what what Christ did
[13:25] here on earth amen is what his bride is
[13:29] gonna do is going to manifest in this
[13:31] house that son of man ministry amen that
[13:34] was gonna produce a resurrection praise
[13:36] the Lord
[13:37] we're just we're just we're just we're
[13:41] God in human flesh in this our God is
[13:44] not going to use any other flesh it's
[13:47] gonna be a work through you and I now
[13:50] why did he choose it that way I don't
[13:52] know but that's how it is and you have
[13:54] to recognize that
[13:57] you have to see it that way that God is
[14:00] doing all this work through me God chose
[14:03] me to do a work like this
[14:05] yes God chose you to do a work like this
[14:08] and this hour
[14:09] praise God first Corinthians chapter 2
[14:12] verse 7 it says but we speak the wisdom
[14:15] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[14:18] wisdom which God ordained before the
[14:20] world unto our glory you see God already
[14:23] ordained desportes that mystery to be
[14:28] for to be a opened up for us already now
[14:36] if he'd done that why are we not
[14:38] manifest in that already know Jesus
[14:43] Christ
[14:44] after he after he died resurrected you
[14:47] know and before he ascended he said all
[14:51] power is given unto me both if all power
[14:56] was given unto him then why are we why
[15:02] doesn't he just go ahead and just have
[15:04] manifested sons of God already you and I
[15:07] just have everything already in us as
[15:10] far as you know be in his very image
[15:13] being his in his fullness no we have to
[15:18] grow in grace and knowledge and
[15:21] revelation just as he did amen because
[15:28] it's all there
[15:29] he's already it's all power is given
[15:32] unto him and if we're part of him all
[15:35] power is given unto us right oh both in
[15:40] heaven and in earth right but why aren't
[15:43] we manifesting that why because we still
[15:50] have revelation Amen that we need to we
[15:52] need to we need to a men God reveals
[15:56] some things to us to us that we manifest
[15:58] amen
[15:59] we here we here we here we listen with
[16:02] listen but I don't think a lot of us are
[16:04] a cop captain yet what's been what's
[16:07] being said including me because we're
[16:11] still here amen that's right perfect
[16:15] stature appropriate man we're all
[16:17] growing right man but you see a child
[16:21] you don't see it grow I'm sorry sister
[16:24] you know a child you don't see it grow I
[16:27] mean you know if you're with it all the
[16:29] time you do not see that child grow
[16:31] yesterday one day whoa as tall as I am
[16:34] but that is a way of Christian man yeah
[16:36] you don't grow overnight that's exactly
[16:39] that it makes little by little it takes
[16:43] layers upon layers upon layers upon
[16:46] layers amen praise God all right so
[16:51] we're all right yes
[16:56] which verse a which none of the princess
[16:58] of this world need for a pad they known
[17:00] it they would not have crucified the
[17:02] Lord of glory you think the Jews would
[17:04] have crucified the Lord if if he was the
[17:07] one to fulfill this whole plan for this
[17:09] world you know the way to meet of
[17:11] unfolding wouldn't have done that if
[17:13] they knew that that was their Messiah
[17:15] they would not have done that but they
[17:17] did not know it was not revealed to them
[17:19] right for they had known it they were
[17:23] not used by the Lord but as it is
[17:24] written I had not seen nor hear had
[17:27] heard neither have entered into the
[17:28] heart of man the things which God hath
[17:30] prepared past tense one thing is in
[17:34] God's mind it's already been done and
[17:36] they men have prepared for them that
[17:38] love all right but God hath revealed
[17:41] past tense
[17:43] hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit
[17:47] right for the spirit searcheth all
[17:50] things yea the deep things of God amen
[17:54] as I said before I believe a shot of the
[17:58] life of a Christian spirit-filled
[18:01] Christian is not satisfied with just
[18:05] Jesus died for me on
[18:06] or I gotta be good Christian I got a
[18:10] lift right I gotta take my tots no the
[18:13] Spirit of God searches all things even
[18:15] the deep things that's what the
[18:18] scripture says right even the deep
[18:21] things of God all right
[18:23] I'm not satisfied with just just a
[18:26] little bit of the word I want more and
[18:27] more and more I want each layer that God
[18:30] wants to give me for what men know if
[18:32] the things of a man save the spirit of
[18:33] Man which is in a men even so the things
[18:37] of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of
[18:39] God you don't know it all you knew is is
[18:43] how to do what you do you know you know
[18:47] I was a good sinner when I was a sinner
[18:49] right so were you but when Christ came
[18:52] on the scene and he filled us with the
[18:54] Holy Ghost amen
[18:55] then we know all things because the
[18:58] Spirit dwelleth in us right because it's
[19:01] the Spirit of God amen revealing those
[19:04] things to us praise God we have the
[19:08] potential of all these for all these
[19:10] things now Psalms 25:18 just raising the
[19:14] secret of the Lord is with them that
[19:16] fear him and he will show them his
[19:18] covenant
[19:19] now maybe I'll show them my covenant no
[19:22] he will show them his covenant even
[19:25] though it's a secret he's going to show
[19:27] it to you for in the time Psalms 27
[19:29] buffer in the time of trouble shall hide
[19:31] me mister linen the secret of his
[19:33] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[19:36] me upon a rock and now shall my head be
[19:39] lifted up above mine enemies round about
[19:41] me therefore will I offer in his
[19:43] Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing
[19:46] yea I will sing unto the Lord in Matthew
[19:49] 13 11 says he answered and said unto
[19:53] them because it is given
[19:56] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[19:58] kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
[20:00] given Jesus speaking to his disciples
[20:02] when disciples asked him why do you talk
[20:05] to them in parables and because of to
[20:08] them was given the seat the know the
[20:10] mysteries of the kingdom now he was
[20:12] thrown mysteries to them some Jesus
[20:15] Christ was explaining mysteries to them
[20:17] and in explaining things to the myth of
[20:21] parables that that he was talking about
[20:23] but that didn't say Peter Paul then he
[20:26] saved them right they still need to go
[20:29] and have a new birth that word was being
[20:33] was was being given to them but that
[20:36] word needed to come alive on the day of
[20:37] Pentecost
[20:38] right right right because even before
[20:41] the day of Pentecost just to lose just a
[20:44] little bit before that
[20:45] Peter Peter and did not Christ and he
[20:47] said I'm going back fishing after
[20:50] healing the sick raising you know doing
[20:53] all these miracles and all these things
[20:55] and yet I think I'm just gonna go and
[20:58] become an entrepreneur again you know
[21:05] great wonderful things taking place and
[21:07] mysteries being given to them and yet he
[21:10] still wanted to go back fishing and I
[21:12] believe sometimes amen we can be just
[21:14] like that we're not careful great
[21:17] mysteries unfolded to us service by
[21:20] service church service by church service
[21:22] and we're just there so what kind of
[21:27] lunch I'm gonna have tomorrow for sure
[21:29] for without working it do I have turkey
[21:32] in my refrigerator and the word and
[21:36] mysteries being unfolded unto us and
[21:38] we're thinking about physical things
[21:43] let's drinks being unfolded them to us
[21:46] but why it takes the revelation of Jesus
[21:49] Christ God given us just like God give
[21:52] it to him in Revelation chapter all the
[21:54] way it says in Revelation chapter 1 I
[21:56] believe the fullness of that revelation
[21:58] was given to Jesus Christ once he
[22:00] resurrected a man from the dead because
[22:03] he said all power is given unto me both
[22:05] heaven and earth amen
[22:08] praise the Lord now I took this before
[22:11] this is the tabernacle
[22:13] I love the tabernacle of Moses it so it
[22:16] just typifies Christ in every aspect but
[22:19] you see these skins now exposed 26:14
[22:22] and thou shalt make a covering for the
[22:23] tent of Rams skins dyed red and the
[22:26] covering above badger skins do you see
[22:30] that there was when this tabernacle was
[22:33] going through the wilderness this is
[22:36] this is what the people externally would
[22:40] see the the tabernacle covered with
[22:43] these with these skins with these bags
[22:46] this badger skin now you tell me if
[22:48] that's pretty that's ugly
[22:52] that's the I give to me if it was me
[22:56] making it I want the world to see the
[22:58] beautiful how beautiful something is I
[23:00] would want the nicer one to be on the
[23:03] outside I mean I think that's how we use
[23:05] most of us are we want the nicer ones of
[23:08] the outside because what you want people
[23:09] to say man that looks sharp
[23:13] that was good but God told this is how
[23:17] God told Moses to build this tabernacle
[23:19] and he put the ugliest one the Badger
[23:22] about your skin on the outside why
[23:27] because the people had no clue that the
[23:32] most beautiful thing was taking place
[23:34] inside of that tabernacle all right and
[23:37] you and me amen we're living in these
[23:39] badger skins right I'm not I mean I'm
[23:45] not the prettiest thing to look at
[23:48] definitely Timbo is not right but God is
[23:56] dwelling in he I'm doing a work manifest
[23:59] in his life in his life among all those
[24:02] layers right now these layers can
[24:06] represent our physical body right we
[24:08] have layers and upon layers on us right
[24:11] mainly there's the three amen the soul
[24:14] the spirit and the body right but also
[24:19] this is how the revelation of Christ
[24:21] unfolds to us right because if somebody
[24:24] would have found that this tabernacle or
[24:27] were to maybe walk in it right and they
[24:31] would have seen it covered like this and
[24:33] everything like that maybe they came
[24:36] from behind or something I don't know
[24:38] exactly this is just a depiction of how
[24:40] man kind of thought thinks that that's
[24:43] how it is but maybe that they would have
[24:45] to go through all these layers to get
[24:47] into the entrance right the same thing
[24:50] with you and I growing in this
[24:52] revelation and this knowledge it's layer
[24:54] upon layer upon layer upon layer of
[24:58] Revelation it's revelation on top of
[25:00] Revelation on top of Revelation and puff
[25:01] of Revelation right and you might think
[25:04] you might be under the badger skin off I
[25:06] got under that God your skin and then oh
[25:08] this is so nice that next skin this is
[25:11] so pretty look how red and
[25:15] it is and you think that's wonderful
[25:17] that revelation is wonderful
[25:19] until God shows you the next revelation
[25:21] on top of that oh this is wonderful
[25:24] this is so beautiful look at this look
[25:27] how it's and then God all of a sudden
[25:30] lifts up the next one and see oh my this
[25:33] is even more wonderful
[25:35] you see Saints that's how that's how we
[25:37] need to be taking every church service
[25:39] that we come to amen it's a revelation
[25:42] on top of Revelation on top of
[25:44] Revelation amen God is unfolding himself
[25:48] because remember just you take your
[25:51] children for example you could not give
[25:55] them everything all at once all the
[25:57] knowledge that they needed to have you
[25:59] they cannot give it to them all at once
[26:01] right they have to take little layers
[26:04] and upon little they're like when you
[26:06] saw that they were mature enough for
[26:07] that layer that you just gave them you
[26:10] could give him a little bit of more on
[26:11] top of that right same thing with Christ
[26:14] with us God with us he's not going to
[26:17] give us everything all at once to
[26:19] overwhelm us it's more beautiful I think
[26:21] when he does it in us in a slower way
[26:24] because why he's teaching us patience
[26:26] and he's seen that effort that you're
[26:28] trying to make for this work God give me
[26:31] more give me more
[26:32] why because there still has not been a
[26:35] resurrection to take place and therefore
[26:38] we have not gotten everything or we have
[26:41] not tapped with the word is there it's
[26:44] been open
[26:45] Jesus Christ said all power is given
[26:46] unto me the seals have been broken here
[26:49] but as brother Wade is said before why
[26:50] are we still here 50 years after the
[26:53] seals have been opened right why was
[26:56] still in 50 years because we have not
[26:59] caught that fullness of the revelation
[27:01] in us and then when they go in there
[27:03] when they get in there amen and beyond
[27:09] Slayer I almost almost kind of type look
[27:12] at this is my life
[27:14] when I was in the mountain de nominal in
[27:17] the nomination you know we were out here
[27:19] first when I was born I was here
[27:21] Catholic and then Joe was when we came
[27:31] to the States Jehovah's Witnesses came
[27:33] and visited us and we thought wow that
[27:36] sounds good so my mom and dad said wow
[27:38] let's go to church over there because we
[27:40] weren't really practicing Catholics we
[27:42] were just kind of like those passive
[27:43] type of Catholics you know we go you
[27:46] know if we wanted to we didn't you know
[27:49] and then wow the HOS witness came
[27:52] knocking at the door and then it wasn't
[27:54] job as witness we got tired of that we
[27:56] went there for a year then we went to
[27:58] doing Baptists for me men and then we
[28:02] went to the Methodists for a while and
[28:04] then from the Methodists we went back to
[28:06] the Baptist and then from the Baptist's
[28:13] we hit Pentecost get a little closer
[28:15] India thank you it was a little closer
[28:19] as much bad girl we're opening up to us
[28:24] you know cuz the Pentecostals they have
[28:26] they had some good things you know that
[28:28] bid and then finally you know God showed
[28:31] us his word amen this message amen
[28:34] but you see I thought at that time when
[28:38] the message came to because it was me
[28:40] that not to say that like it was me but
[28:43] it was i we all heard it my mom my dad
[28:47] my sisters we all heard it all at the
[28:49] same time but it was really me that that
[28:53] wanted to look more into it my dad was
[28:56] still kind of passive with it and
[28:57] everything because he didn't understand
[28:59] what was going on and so I started
[29:01] studying this Baptist in the name of
[29:02] Lord Jesus Christ even more MORE
[29:05] Wow and I said that you've got to see
[29:08] these scriptures you've got to see these
[29:09] things and when he saw the scriptures
[29:11] when he saw the word remember he was
[29:12] Baptist and Mike's brother Dale says you
[29:15] know about this know the word my dad was
[29:18] very
[29:18] he knows the word but he but Bumi so
[29:21] when you see show him the word and they
[29:23] said wow there's nobody back doesn't
[29:25] name father son Holy Ghost that's it
[29:28] give me more Lord so and so we had just
[29:33] appreciate the Lord so but in there and
[29:38] that's why the Bible says that there was
[29:39] no beauty in Christ that we should that
[29:41] we should Christ when he was here on
[29:44] earth he wasn't he was like a common
[29:46] regular man just like you and I appeared
[29:50] at that time you know long garments you
[29:55] know just look just like any other man
[29:57] but within him dwelleth the fullness of
[30:00] the Godhead bodily
[30:01] and you and I on this are you you and I
[30:06] are just common people you know but
[30:09] within us amen it was God in our soul
[30:12] amen now we're going to have it in down
[30:16] payment of it maybe just a portion of it
[30:20] but it's all God even that portion and
[30:22] if we can do these greater works even
[30:25] with that little portion imagine that he
[30:27] meant meant the fullness amen
[30:29] takes place amen then those
[30:32] Resurrectionist has to take place amen
[30:35] then and then after that is a rapture
[30:37] praise God and this is Scripture a man
[30:42] who hath believed our report to whom is
[30:44] the arm of the Lord revealed revelation
[30:47] for he shall grow up before him as a
[30:50] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[30:52] ground have you guys ever have you seen
[30:58] a root now you see the Bible says this
[31:01] says he shall grow built before him as a
[31:03] tender plant who is he talking about
[31:05] what's this here to talk about talking
[31:07] about Christ right and as a root out of
[31:11] a dry ground right but in the corded
[31:17] button we're talking in this case I'm
[31:19] talking about Christ amen in
[31:21] in this in this month a moment but you
[31:24] see Christ a room is something ugly when
[31:29] you're when you're out in the garden and
[31:30] you're looking at your beautiful garden
[31:32] of flowers and everything you plant even
[31:34] other things that you plant you don't
[31:36] say what beautiful group that is that's
[31:40] such a pretty root no you look at the at
[31:44] the at the fruit at the end what's come
[31:47] out of the root right and so and as a
[31:52] root out of a dry ground all right he
[31:56] had no form nor comeliness right in
[32:00] other words he's not something beautiful
[32:01] to look after and when we shall seek him
[32:04] there is no beauty that we should desire
[32:05] him didn't the scripture saying we
[32:10] didn't we didn't waiting when we would
[32:11] look when people would look at Jesus
[32:13] Christ back then they would it wasn't
[32:14] something oh man I want to get in here
[32:17] but the only way people wanted more of
[32:20] him is because of the works that he
[32:22] would manifest same thing with you or
[32:24] not God and God looks at people look at
[32:28] us like a regular common people Amen but
[32:30] if you're talking a good if you say
[32:33] you're a Christian and you manifest that
[32:36] on the outside because remember people
[32:37] want to see works they don't want to see
[32:40] you just talking want to hear you
[32:42] talking remember that there's that same
[32:45] don't preach me a sermon let me a sermon
[32:47] okay that's exactly what people out in
[32:49] the world want because they are all of
[32:52] them out there they don't live sermons
[32:54] they talk serve that you know sermons
[32:57] they can you know but they want some
[33:00] ones they see somebody living a sermon
[33:01] that's something I opens out I want some
[33:06] more of that you give me more of that
[33:08] that's the same thing with Christ he is
[33:10] despised and rejected of men a man of
[33:12] sorrows and acquainted
[33:13] and we did as it were our faces from him
[33:16] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[33:19] reminds me of Peter when Christ was
[33:22] being was saying the priests and the
[33:26] Roman soldiers and everything and at one
[33:28] point Peter he said Lord I'll follow you
[33:31] wherever you go there I can't yeah no
[33:33] way I will deny him and it came the time
[33:35] to see if he was gonna pass that test
[33:38] and he did not need to not him and he
[33:40] didn't even want anything to do with
[33:42] Krait no I don't know that man I don't
[33:46] know that I meant in person and
[33:49] everything so
[33:56] now brother Brown says here throwing
[33:58] ties
[33:59] oh we got about five more minutes hmm
[34:05] now the Bible says here but many that
[34:07] are first shall be last in the last
[34:09] shell divorce mark chapter 10 verse 31
[34:12] amen brother brems says here in the seal
[34:14] of God 1954 now watch him said hold it
[34:17] until what the eleventh hour people
[34:19] could come in the last calling of the
[34:23] Gentiles mother worked there dad and
[34:25] then work here grandmother work back
[34:28] there
[34:28] this is our age the eleventh hour that
[34:32] world war stopped on the eleventh month
[34:34] in the year the eleventh day of the
[34:35] month the eleventh hour that day in the
[34:37] day the eleventh minute in the hour that
[34:40] the eleventh hour people might come in a
[34:43] man pain what received the same baptism
[34:47] of the Holy Ghost that they did back
[34:49] there in the beginning we receive the
[34:54] same baptism it hasn't changed right I
[34:59] couldn't begin to bring back the power
[35:03] and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[35:05] Christ same signs and wonders the same
[35:10] power in the resurrection of the Lord
[35:11] Jesus Christ and because Jesus Christ is
[35:15] the first fruit to the resurrection he
[35:18] had to race first and then the body
[35:20] follows just right behind as I said
[35:24] before when you are when you are laying
[35:26] in your bed when you get up in the
[35:28] morning
[35:29] some of us kind of maybe fall out but me
[35:37] personally what comes up first is the
[35:40] head I raise my head up from my pillow
[35:44] first right and then the body follows
[35:47] right that's exactly what happened in
[35:51] the life of Jesus Christ in the church
[35:53] that followed behind me he raised first
[35:56] the head
[35:57] amen
[35:58] then the body follows after it's got to
[36:01] read Ram says it has to there's no way
[36:04] that your head just gets up from the bed
[36:06] and the body doesn't follow you this way
[36:08] that's freak you're a freak then that's
[36:12] creepy
[36:13] they meant it has to the bodies if
[36:17] you're attached to that to that vine if
[36:20] you are attached to that vine praise God
[36:23] now as I've said before and of course I
[36:28] don't say this as a doctrine or nothing
[36:30] like that but I just can't help to look
[36:33] at this picture and it just to me just
[36:35] looks like a body that's laying down it
[36:38] really it really does to me now I know
[36:42] that the darkness the dark parts it
[36:44] represents the dark but it's just the
[36:46] way that is just drawn it kind of
[36:48] reminds me of he can use this analogy
[36:51] but that movie Frankenstein you know
[36:55] when when the doctor doctor whatever the
[36:58] doctor was building the body you know
[37:00] and then eventually he has that brain
[37:03] you know I just need that brain man and
[37:06] then that minute once you guess that
[37:08] brain it comes to life all right once
[37:10] the head is your manifesting the son of
[37:13] man which is the head in this hour they
[37:17] meant that bodies come into life that
[37:19] resurrection is taking place this thing
[37:21] is coming out and praise God
[37:28] got one minute all right but Ren says
[37:31] here now the church / / professed to be
[37:34] a Christian Church we'll have to have
[37:36] that same spirit that was in Jesus
[37:38] Christ attitude for at the resurrection
[37:42] of the church Christ and his bride will
[37:45] come together and dovetail the writings
[37:48] and promises of God will be made
[37:50] fulfilled there so it cannot come
[37:52] together unless the same spirit was in
[37:54] Christ is in you and me and then if that
[37:57] same spirit is in there it'll do the
[38:00] same words and live the same kind of a
[38:01] separated life and through the works it
[38:04] got cut off that he did amen
[38:07] and I don't know if you've seen this
[38:09] picture of the Bride of Christ I turned
[38:12] this over like this because the picture
[38:15] the picture but if the bride is dressed
[38:18] in the Word of God this is this is right
[38:20] that's that's the dress that the bride
[38:22] has him me in the head and to me I put
[38:26] put it over the church edges because
[38:28] it's the Bride of Christ throughout the
[38:29] whole church ages amen at the end time
[38:32] that son of man ministry has to has to
[38:35] be manifest at once again right who is
[38:39] the head that thing's coming up praise
[38:43] the Lord Amen so I guess let's go ahead
[38:47] [Music]
[38:57] [Music]
[39:08] [Music]
[39:16] that's why they don't recognize it's
[39:19] just too simplistic yeah yeah I just hit
[39:25] this but I guess
