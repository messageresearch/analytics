[15:40] here with us all the time God bless you
[15:43] good to be back in the house with the
[15:44] Lord if you got your Bibles turn to the
[15:46] Book of Revelations I'd like for you to
[15:47] hang on to your bibles if if you I know
[15:50] that's kind of strange sometimes even
[15:51] with
[15:52] me uh not taking your Bible anymore
[15:55] because it's always up on the screen but
[15:57] we're going to look at something and and
[15:59] I want you to see it for yourself I've
[16:00] got it written on here but I want to see
[16:02] how you to see how the continuity of God
[16:05] works even in
[16:07] writing the letters to the churches all
[16:10] right because we're going to talk about
[16:11] today Alpha and Omega which is the alpha
[16:13] bride and Omega bride all right now
[16:15] we're not we're not doing away with the
[16:19] there's bride through every Church age
[16:22] but he said four times in in Revelations
[16:26] I am the Alpha and Omega he is
[16:28] identifying that what he started with
[16:30] he's going to end with now what in
[16:33] between it went down it went down
[16:35] somewhat because of dogmas and Creeds
[16:37] but the first church age didn't have any
[16:39] the last Church age is not going to have
[16:41] any all right the true bride now that'll
[16:43] be a different ones it'll be false uh
[16:46] bride and there'll be foolish virgins
[16:47] and all that but the true bride in the
[16:49] first church age is a mere image of the
[16:51] true bride in the last Church age all
[16:54] right anybody with me on that not doing
[16:57] away with any of those in between
[16:58] they're just as important they're the
[16:59] body of Christ but God
[17:01] said Jesus said I am Alpha and Omega the
[17:04] beginning and the end the first and the
[17:05] last all right so we're going to hone in
[17:08] on that today if you would in
[17:10] Revelations 1 remember the announcements
[17:14] um not this coming Saturday but the next
[17:16] Saturday February 17th at 4:00 down at

[20:46] appreciate all of them appreciate what
[20:48] he brings to the table amen so let's go
[20:51] to Revelations 1 ver10 remember all
[20:53] these
[20:54] announcements um keep them all in your
[20:56] prayers um of them all coming back
[20:59] brother Ryan and them be on the way from
[21:00] Kentucky back in just a little bit so
[21:02] remember them so Revelations
[21:04] 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[21:06] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[21:08] of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[21:11] the first and the last what thou seest
[21:13] right in the book SED into the seven
[21:15] churches which are in Asia they're
[21:18] Ephesus smrna these are actual cities I
[21:20] don't know if y'all know these are
[21:21] actual cities that that rose up in a
[21:24] certain um area uh there in Asia Minor
[21:27] and there still there now today to some
[21:29] degree they may not all be called the
[21:31] same thing but and some of them were
[21:34] destroyed some of them were uh uh
[21:37] Ephesus used to be on the coast now it's
[21:38] silted up like 2 miles Inland so they're
[21:40] two miles away from the from the coast
[21:42] now and but when when when God was
[21:45] talking to John it was like
[21:47] 96 these places some of them had been
[21:50] established a long time but they're
[21:52] characteristic God said hey there's the
[21:54] Ephesus Smur and all these different
[21:55] ones going to bring the character of
[21:57] each one into that so Ephesus Smyrna
[22:00] pergamus thar so these are real people
[22:02] that lived in real cities these are real
[22:04] cities and they listen they were not all
[22:06] bride
[22:08] cities uh Paul lived in Ephesus for a
[22:10] little while um Mary um the mother of
[22:14] Jesus lived in there and I think she
[22:15] died there and John the Revelator went
[22:18] back there and he lived there because he
[22:21] pastored the church there in Ephesus
[22:22] until he passed away so they they've
[22:25] been into each one of these but these
[22:27] were real people real places just like
[22:29] we got a Gainesville a lul they all have
[22:31] a characteristic Gainesville is the
[22:33] polter capital of the world so you've
[22:34] got each each city has a a character
[22:37] about it and uh and so God thought about
[22:40] these cities enough to like I said
[22:41] Sister Barbara sent that thing where the
[22:43] constellations of the Stars fit right
[22:45] over exactly where they're placed in
[22:47] asiia minor so um to me that's important
[22:51] God's always in continuity he does not
[22:53] change but he puts everything where it
[22:56] needs to be even before before we need
[22:58] it all right cuz he wrote the Bible
[23:00] before the foundation of the world but
[23:02] he imposed a group of people to move to
[23:05] a place called Ephesus and start a city
[23:08] of Ephesus move over here to thara
[23:11] raised up people put it in there put it
[23:13] in their mind he he he told them go
[23:16] there do this all right they just didn't
[23:17] know maybe it was leading to the Lord
[23:19] sometimes we get led by the Lord and we
[23:20] go I don't know if that's the Lord or
[23:22] not but if it takes you into the word of
[23:23] God and it doesn't take you away from
[23:25] the word of God then it's God how you
[23:28] you get here huh you think about how you
[23:30] got here all right and I turned to see
[23:33] the voice that spake with me and being
[23:35] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[23:37] and in the midst of the seven
[23:38] candlesticks one liken to the son of man
[23:40] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[23:41] and G about the pouch with a golden
[23:43] girle and then he has all these
[23:44] different characteristics we talked
[23:46] about this morning so let's bow our
[23:48] heads Lord thank you for this day you've
[23:49] give us thank you for the group that
[23:52] you've Lord put in this building today
[23:54] Lord that can hear from you father I
[23:56] pray that you just bless each one heal
[23:58] the sick Lord be with the ones Lord that
[24:00] are downhearted maybe backslid different
[24:02] things Lord I pray that you'd give us
[24:04] Supernatural strength Lord and thank you
[24:06] so much Lord for putting together a team
[24:09] of of men and and sisters that in
[24:12] different places and uh some that can
[24:14] teach Sunday school and do the different
[24:16] things and and just bless brother John
[24:18] and touch him Lord as he we all need the
[24:21] financial help we all need help from you
[24:23] Lord so I pray that you'd bless him and
[24:25] touch him Lord just bless each one for
[24:27] for us of our sins Jesus name we pray
[24:30] Lord be with the ones that are on the
[24:32] way back amen so you may be seated so
[24:35] the Lord is standing there in the midst
[24:37] as we said before he's got his arms
[24:39] stretched out that's the cross he makes
[24:41] actually his own being is the cross just
[24:44] like this right here there he is he's
[24:46] made the cross he's got the candlesticks
[24:48] he's got all the church ages and like I
[24:50] said before don't think that the Holy
[24:53] Ghost was not in any of the other Church
[24:55] ages he was in every Church age because
[24:58] you can't have the Holy you can't have
[25:00] the new birth and not be bride right all
[25:04] right the new birth makes you the Bride
[25:06] of Jesus Christ all right so the first
[25:08] age had it the second age had it the
[25:10] third age had it every age had it but
[25:13] God's got to have a starting place and
[25:15] God's got to have an ending place with
[25:18] the
[25:18] Gentiles cuz he promised that's what
[25:20] he'd be even in Daniel 70 weeks we can
[25:22] run all this into the same thing you've
[25:24] got the time of the Gentiles then God
[25:26] goes to the Jews all right then they've
[25:28] got a time they got three and A2 years
[25:30] right of
[25:31] ministry to come to Perfection so God is
[25:35] he's not a Time creature but he uses
[25:37] time you know why he uses time because
[25:39] we can't use eternity right we have to
[25:43] use time so he has to coordinate it
[25:45] where we can understand
[25:47] time and and then realize that it come
[25:50] from eternity cuz God's an eternal
[25:52] person he's never had a he never had a
[25:54] watch on his arm that's for
[25:56] sure but he's standing here and he says
[25:58] okay I'm going to have a bride I'm going
[26:00] to have seven Church agents I'm going to
[26:01] have seven stars or seven Messengers and
[26:05] I'm going to have seven cities that are
[26:06] built to show that I'm the one doing
[26:11] it no other man could orchestrate this
[26:15] no other singular person could ever
[26:17] orchestrate what God's
[26:19] orchestrated but he said I'm going to
[26:21] have a bride she's going to be me made
[26:24] manifest in another form she's going to
[26:26] be the judge she's going to have the
[26:28] sword out of their mouth because every
[26:30] Church AE messenger he had a sword and
[26:32] he spoke right and he also had like we
[26:36] said about the Judgment the the Saints
[26:37] will judge the Earth we're going to even
[26:39] judge Angels right okay so so where
[26:43] where're the judge of all we know that
[26:45] Christ is the Jud we know he's the
[26:47] Supreme judge but he made us Kings and
[26:50] Priests he made us to be the ones that
[26:53] can judge cuz we'll read the scripture
[26:55] where it says if you judge yourself you
[26:56] be not judged all right we'll read that
[26:58] in the the communion scripture all right
[27:00] so then we talked about prison this
[27:02] morning and you got one light going in
[27:04] which is what you got Christ then you
[27:08] got
[27:09] seven
[27:10] different but they flow into each other
[27:13] have you ever looked at a rainbow
[27:14] there's not like a line and then a blue
[27:16] and then a line and then a yellow
[27:18] everyone molds into the other one goes
[27:22] from one it flows right into the other
[27:24] when you'll see it right here they just
[27:26] kind of flow you got you red it didn't
[27:28] go red
[27:30] yellow it went red
[27:33] orange yellow green then it keep then it
[27:36] goes back toward the blue again so
[27:38] everybody see that the continuity of God
[27:39] is that it's a flowing it flowed from
[27:42] one Church age to the other now we're
[27:44] going to realize that when brother R set
[27:46] these things up he gives us a
[27:48] date for each Church age when it began
[27:51] and when it ended but you got to
[27:52] remember there's a lap over of time and
[27:54] you also got to remember that God didn't
[27:55] just abruptly shut off One Church age
[27:59] there was a lap over there was some that
[28:01] was H over from this age that they
[28:02] lapped over into the other age but
[28:04] remember those people though were on the
[28:07] way
[28:08] down right because the messengers got to
[28:11] come and rebuke them pick them up and
[28:14] take them into another church age all
[28:16] right or another message let's say all
[28:18] right and we'll look at that real quick
[28:20] I want to uh thank Brother Anderson he
[28:22] sure helped me with this right here I
[28:24] appreciate Brother
[28:26] Anderson
[28:28] hold on no I I appreciate brother
[28:31] [Applause]
[28:38] and he's so
[28:41] short and
[28:44] unnoticeable yeah anyway all right so he
[28:48] was showed me how to move this back and
[28:49] forth I know some of you can can you see
[28:51] you may not see the the letters but
[28:54] that's kind of what brother brandham
[28:55] Drew and to get this thing
[28:57] started this is the this is the
[29:01] candlesticks this is all connected
[29:04] though to a bowl this was the old the
[29:06] old type where the the priest would pour
[29:08] the the olive oil the special oil and
[29:11] remember if you look in the Bible that
[29:13] oil was used for nothing
[29:15] else the Holy Ghost is not used for but
[29:18] one thing and that's to give you the
[29:20] Holy Ghost himself all right so you got
[29:23] that and then you got the Wicks that
[29:24] come
[29:25] out all right and he separated Ephesus
[29:29] ad 53 to 170 now and and to make it
[29:34] Church ages you got to stop it and you
[29:36] got to uh look at the moon phases and
[29:39] and it's like
[29:40] brother excuse
[29:42] me brother Louise preached one time you
[29:45] know this looks like a person laying
[29:47] down you know but he but we're to rise
[29:50] in the church age right here we're
[29:52] supposed to come up all right so this
[29:54] church age is the alpha Church age this
[29:57] church age is the Omega Church age which
[30:00] is the one we're in right now all right
[30:02] all these others in between had a dip of
[30:04] the Holy Ghost but they had flaws and
[30:08] errors all
[30:11] right not that they weren't Christians
[30:13] they just had flaws and errors because
[30:16] remember God said I'm going to I'm going
[30:18] to be Alpha and Omega he said that four
[30:22] times in the Book of Revelation so it
[30:24] must be important and I read you a
[30:25] little while where brother R said that
[30:26] is important
[30:28] he said he's not in the middle ones but
[30:30] remember what brother R saiding he's not
[30:33] in he was in his fullness in the first
[30:34] church age they didn't have Baptist and
[30:37] Methodist on every corner in the first
[30:39] church age right now we got them now but
[30:42] we've been called out come out of her my
[30:44] people on this end because guess where
[30:46] they got developed down through them
[30:48] other five Church ages in between there
[30:50] was a denominational idea come in and
[30:53] Tau him you could do whatever you wanted
[30:55] to do you could come to church when you
[30:56] wanted to you you didn't have to really
[30:57] go to church come as you are just come
[30:59] in whatever you got on and you're good
[31:02] and that's not what God said let me say
[31:05] something one
[31:07] time and I just want to be real clear
[31:10] let me put this back down thank you
[31:11] brother Anderson bless your
[31:13] heart cuz see I can look at
[31:16] that look at
[31:20] that
[31:22] listen I don't want
[31:25] Church like we said we went to the
[31:27] church the other day uh well we didn't
[31:30] have church service here I went down to
[31:31] the Baptist Church and it's just it's
[31:34] like a
[31:35] lodge I think sometimes we get into a
[31:37] point to where when we come to church I
[31:40] mean this church it's kind of like a uh
[31:42] you know family reunion which it is in a
[31:45] spiritual sense and but it's not a place
[31:48] that you can go outside and just talk
[31:50] any way you want to get where I'm saying
[31:53] and then hop into church five minutes
[31:55] after the church starts
[31:57] that's not a Christian way to do it and
[31:59] you brought a devil in with
[32:02] you didn't brother R say 20 minutes
[32:04] before the service start did he change
[32:06] that when he died I don't think he did
[32:08] there's a reason behind
[32:10] that to get your mind ready to get your
[32:13] thoughts not on outside there and who's
[32:15] going what's going on with my job and my
[32:18] family and my right here right it's
[32:21] important cuz you bring devils in with
[32:24] you when that door opens after 2:00 I
[32:26] just want when I see him I say well
[32:28] there comes another
[32:29] devil I don't mean nothing about the
[32:32] person but you know you didn't clear
[32:34] your mind out down
[32:36] there come
[32:38] on here's where you clear it
[32:41] out that's Twi when I said 20 minutes
[32:44] before service starts you ought to be in
[32:45] here praying you say well I got
[32:48] something to say it
[32:51] later got all other time in the
[32:54] world stay off your phone maybe for a
[32:56] little while
[32:58] yeah all right now look I just want
[33:01] because I want us to be I want it to
[33:03] flow I want to say I want it to flow
[33:05] because it doesn't flow when there's an
[33:06] evil
[33:08] spirit that's why brother rown said be
[33:10] here 20 minutes before the service
[33:12] starts we believe in everything he says
[33:14] until something we don't want to do and
[33:16] then we don't well that's not very
[33:17] important anyway but look this is this
[33:21] is a statement that that I kind of get
[33:22] from the whole thing the seven Church
[33:24] ages is a complete and Final
[33:28] revelation of Jesus
[33:30] Christ to the world now you know he goes
[33:33] to Israel but remember is that Israel's
[33:35] not
[33:37] bride the foolish virgin is not bride
[33:40] the cup of water my name is not
[33:43] bride we're bride right so it started on
[33:47] the day of
[33:48] Pentecost with 120 and then it ends with
[33:52] us taking a body change that is the
[33:55] complete and final revelation of Jesus
[33:57] Christ for this Earth in this whole
[34:01] 2,000 years we've been in this Gentile
[34:04] dispensations everybody with me all
[34:06] right it's not to the world the world
[34:09] may get eternal life you the foolish
[34:11] virgin will get eternal life it says it
[34:13] the Bible and but you got to go to the
[34:15] white Throne
[34:17] judgment but if you come to that
[34:19] complete final Revelation to Jesus
[34:21] Christ got that's why you had to have a
[34:23] alpha bride and Omega bride be the same
[34:27] it be miror image of each other all
[34:29] right ybody with me so this these Church
[34:32] ages are important it tells the
[34:34] character of Jesus Christ it tells
[34:36] everything he's doing while me and you
[34:38] can relate to it on this Earth we can
[34:41] relate to this these are real people I
[34:43] was thinking the other day you know we
[34:45] say Well church in Ephesus and we just
[34:47] kind of go on there was people there
[34:50] doctors lawyers
[34:52] nurses carders they were they were there
[34:55] working
[34:58] yeah maybe not car
[35:00] dealer donkey donkey
[35:06] dealers I'll stop right there cart
[35:10] dealers um
[35:13] um buggy makers and all that stuff but
[35:17] I'm trying I'm digging myself back out
[35:19] of this but um but but they were people
[35:23] right sitting in church service
[35:26] listening to Paul listening to irus
[35:28] listen to Martin listen to Columba and
[35:31] taking and being being being
[35:34] people right but
[35:37] bride took that word and held it and it
[35:40] made them different it put them in their
[35:43] own age listening to their message of
[35:46] the age right right right so it's not
[35:49] just a city because remember a city is
[35:53] what nothing without
[35:55] people a City's not build when the when
[35:58] the when the uh the time says all the
[36:01] whole city came out and watched the
[36:03] parade well all the you know South State
[36:07] Bank and First National Bank and they
[36:10] didn't come hopping in the city you know
[36:12] the the the building didn't come hopping
[36:13] out to the corner what was on the
[36:16] corner yeah I'm strange sister I'm
[36:18] strange it's
[36:20] okay who came out the people talking to
[36:24] you the people the people people came
[36:27] out not the buildings so what is the
[36:29] city of Ephesus it's the people that was
[36:31] in it and there were bride there just
[36:35] like you and I there's a Le out of sea
[36:36] out there that's blind wretched
[36:39] miserable and naked and they don't know
[36:41] it but you and I know it because we can
[36:43] see it by the word of God all right so
[36:47] these seven Church ages is a complete
[36:48] and final revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:51] John 1:14 says what is going but he's
[36:53] telling us and identifying I read you
[36:54] several quotes this morning where in in
[36:57] Scriptures it talks about in his flesh
[37:00] flesh it talks about flesh in flesh job
[37:04] even said in my flesh I shall see
[37:08] God so the thing that Satan attacked
[37:11] come on somebody the thing that Satan
[37:15] attacked he made that bride fall
[37:19] Eve by getting in the flesh doing
[37:22] something in the flesh right God's going
[37:25] to take that same
[37:27] flesh amen and he's going to defeat him
[37:30] on this side cuz they went to death you
[37:34] and I are going to a body
[37:37] change so John 1:14 the word was made
[37:40] flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the
[37:41] bride that was his people that was his
[37:45] body right a body th has prepared me
[37:48] what the body of Believers we know it
[37:51] was one man Jesus Christ but then he
[37:53] imparts his life to each one of us by
[37:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[37:57] makes us Christ in another form called a
[38:01] bride we bestow all on our bride if you
[38:04] got a wonderful wife you try to give her
[38:06] the best you can you brother John's
[38:08] going to help us with that we going to
[38:09] try to get the best we can and just
[38:13] releases rolling her
[38:17] eyes he
[38:20] will why wouldn't you give you bride the
[38:23] best listen he gave us the best Church
[38:25] AG Messengers
[38:27] amen or he would have send somebody else
[38:30] why you know God didn't say well I think
[38:31] I'll send irenius and then when the
[38:33] irenius comes on on the scene and starts
[38:35] preaching and God's up there going no no
[38:37] no I didn't mean him I didn't mean him I
[38:38] get rid of him and give him somebody
[38:39] else he doesn't make a mistake when God
[38:42] said it's irenius irenius is a man you
[38:44] got to listen to when it says William
[38:47] man brandom that's the person you got to
[38:49] listen to I didn't say that God said it
[38:52] I'm going to send you a messenger that
[38:54] will tell you the truth right
[38:58] so we talked about this morning about a
[38:59] new dispensation which come from the old
[39:01] dispensation of the of the Old Testament
[39:03] where it was bulls and goats and dos and
[39:05] don'ts and this and that and God was
[39:07] this angry God and everything we done he
[39:09] just hated us brother Brown thought that
[39:12] you
[39:13] know he said I thought he said I thought
[39:17] Jehovah hated me but Jesus loved me he
[39:20] said I come to find out they're the same
[39:22] person they were just in a different
[39:24] dispensation once he got down here among
[39:27] flesh and was made flesh he became one
[39:30] of us and then being become one of us he
[39:33] can understand us and know what we go
[39:35] through all the way
[39:37] up so Hebrews 10: 19 says having
[39:40] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[39:42] into the Holy by the blood of Jesus by a
[39:44] New and Living Way so it's all it's new
[39:47] I'm telling you even when you're a
[39:48] Christian when you're a Christian you
[39:50] first start your journey it's
[39:52] new your your your your your your you

[40:50] devil and it was
[40:54] common but boy

[40:59] life and we don't do that no more and
[41:02] Satan don't understand that CU he keeps
[41:04] doing it right he can't understand how
[41:08] we can
[41:08] change or God can change us actually and
[41:11] give us a new desire that down inside
[41:15] that's what did motivate us was happy

[42:17] and NOA he he was with you know bless
[42:20] his heart we were sitting one time tell
[42:22] you how people think and uh we went to
[42:25] Longhorn in Gainesville and big old line
[42:28] of kids and and this has been a long
[42:30] time ago I think Jacob and him were
[42:32] still here and Josh and him and they
[42:34] were we all went together and big old
[42:35] long table at Longhorns big I mean it
[42:38] was we had probably 25 people or so
[42:40] there well everybody orders water you
[42:43] know good Christian thing to order water
[42:46] tea maybe a little uh uh Arnold Palmer
[42:50] every once in a while that's your mixed
[42:51] drink when you're a
[42:54] Christian for those y'all don't know
[42:56] that it's half lemonade and half half
[42:58] tea but everybody starts sitting down
[43:01] here and here comes and Ernie didn't
[43:03] just order a little
[43:04] one he had a a was it daer strawberry
[43:09] strawberry daer you for those of you
[43:12] that know that you're shaking your head
[43:13] and you're laughing some of you don't
[43:15] it's a mixed drink but it's got
[43:17] something in it but it's red I mean
[43:20] strawberry Red and he didn't get a
[43:22] little one he got one like a platter wow
[43:24] and here comes the L she's giv us all
[43:26] our stuff and here she comes with that
[43:29] and by the time she gets down Ernie's at
[43:30] the very end of the table she gets to
[43:32] she sets it down by the time she sets it
[43:34] down you could hear next
[43:38] [Laughter]
[43:42] Going
[43:44] H but it was what they call a virgin is
[43:47] there was no alcohol in it he just liked
[43:49] the taste of the of the uh like I ain't
[43:53] telling about talking about Sunday
[43:54] either but but but see you see the
[43:57] perception
[43:58] is but to me just to me though I would
[44:01] stay away from any of that because it
[44:03] would show somebody that didn't know now
[44:05] everybody sat around him was like this
[44:06] guy's going to have a good time here in
[44:08] just about 30 minutes cuz if he drinks
[44:10] all that he's going to have a good time
[44:13] well we had a good time and he he didn't
[44:16] have a bit of alcohol in it at all but
[44:18] he just liked the taste of it but you
[44:19] see what I mean about
[44:21] perception the perception was I wouldn't
[44:23] do that because it people would perceive
[44:26] that that's what I'm that that I would
[44:28] drinking you know alcoholic
[44:30] beverage but you know what it didn't
[44:32] bother the people sitting around the
[44:33] people around like whatever you know
[44:35] give me one of
[44:36] them but we've been changed by a New and
[44:39] Living Way We Don't e don't even enter
[44:42] in our mind to order
[44:45] that I mean how many of
[44:49] y'all pick up that little thing on your
[44:52] table that's got all the
[44:54] drink
[44:57] and you look at it to see what the price
[45:01] is no you take it fold it put it over
[45:05] here get rid of that
[45:08] thing don't play in don't play in don't
[45:10] play in The Devil's Playground he's got
[45:13] you when you walk in all right so the
[45:15] best thing to do is just get away from
[45:17] it but there's New Testament so this is
[45:20] a new way for us uh when you become a
[45:22] Christian there's there's thoughts and
[45:24] ideas and that's why it's way at the
[45:26] bottom you have faith and then you build
[45:28] up and you grow into these things as a
[45:30] new Christian we make mistakes listen as
[45:32] an old Christian you make mistakes but
[45:34] but I hope we don't make the ones that
[45:36] we may have made every how many years
[45:38] ago all right everybody with me yeah
[45:41] I'll say that
[45:43] too because of our memory right so this
[45:47] new testament or this New Covenant or
[45:48] this new will is coming to effect Jesus
[45:51] is going there's only one person that
[45:52] can bring it into effect and that's the
[45:54] Lord amen like we're going to take
[45:56] communion he took the cup and he told
[45:58] him said this is my blood of the New
[46:00] Testament then he said what this is my
[46:04] body which is broken for you this do in
[46:05] remembrance of me this cup of the New
[46:07] Testament in my blood this do you as
[46:09] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[46:11] me all right it's not blood it's wine
[46:16] but it's a symbolics it's a symb just
[46:18] like water baptism and all it's a symbol
[46:20] it shows the world right all right and
[46:24] and and I'll just you know we all honest
[46:26] and we all human beings when you we
[46:29] start taking communion that door H just
[46:31] gets
[46:32] hot the people leaving you shouldn't I
[46:36] mean you should if you don't want to
[46:37] take it but if you're not going to take
[46:38] it just say I'm not going to take it I
[46:40] mean I'd come to church and I just say
[46:42] no but that shows the world that you're
[46:45] not ready to take it and that you're
[46:47] maybe not a Christian or maybe you got
[46:49] some problems or some
[46:52] issues listen we're just humans I want
[46:55] every everybody take communion I wish
[46:57] you could lock that back
[47:01] door but I wish everybody just take it
[47:04] when it's given to you and you say Thank
[47:07] You Lord and you pick that up you pick
[47:09] the wafer up you don't have any no I
[47:12] don't
[47:14] know these are ordinances that we should
[47:17] do right as a Christian we do them
[47:20] anyway all right if you don't do them
[47:22] then check yourself
[47:24] up
[47:26] even brother Ram said if you got
[47:27] something you need to take care of he
[47:29] said if you're a Christian take
[47:30] communion then go get it figured out or
[47:32] straightened out which whatever is in
[47:34] your mind cuz every one of us have
[47:35] things in our mind that's why we have a
[47:38] moment of Silent prayer to them demons
[47:41] y'all brought in when you was late hello
[47:43] somebody you can get them out the
[47:45] door before you take
[47:48] communion before you take of the spirit
[47:50] get rid of the
[47:51] spirit Hebrews 9:11 says Christ being
[47:54] become a high priest of good good things
[47:56] to come by a greater more perfect
[47:57] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[47:59] to say not of this building neither by
[48:01] the blood of goats and calves but by his
[48:04] own blood he entered once into the holy
[48:06] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[48:08] for us now this is a guy named Paul
[48:11] right Paul like I said before Paul lived
[48:15] over in this section the Old Testament
[48:18] section before he got born again then he
[48:20] come into a New and Living Way over here
[48:22] and he's saying hey that's okay for that
[48:26] time but that dispensation is
[48:28] over there's a new and better way a New
[48:31] and Living
[48:33] Way that comes to
[48:35] humanity not through an animal right for
[48:39] if the blood of bulls and of goats and
[48:40] the ashes of an hepher sprinkle the
[48:41] unclean Sanctified to the purifying of
[48:43] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[48:46] of Christ keep you out of happy hour all
[48:48] right same thing right who through the
[48:51] eternal spirit offered himself without
[48:53] spot to God Purge your conscience
[48:57] I purge your conscience from dead Works
[49:00] to serve the Living God and for this
[49:02] cause he is a mediator of the New
[49:04] Testament that by means of death for the
[49:06] Redemption of the transgression that
[49:09] were under the first testament they
[49:10] which are called might receive the
[49:11] promise of Eternal inheritance for where
[49:14] a testament is there must also necessity
[49:17] be the death of that person that makes
[49:19] the testimony or the test or the will I
[49:22] mean listen how many of you have went to
[49:25] the went to the lawyer's office and and
[49:27] read a will and the person that wrote it
[49:29] sitting beside
[49:31] you no he's usually gone
[49:34] right he or she's usually gone but they
[49:38] have left you something well praise God
[49:40] somebody did the same thing but he's
[49:43] Eternal and he gave you eternal life and
[49:46] then he did pass out gifts cuz in his
[49:49] will there is
[49:51] gifts that we should take full advantage
[49:53] of this year we should take full
[49:55] advantage of of all the gifts all nonp
[49:57] spiritual gifts wisdom and all the
[49:58] different things speaking in tongues is
[50:00] fine when it's done right for a
[50:03] testament is a fourth after men are dead
[50:06] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[50:08] while the testator liveth what you think
[50:11] you'd be a lawyer sitting there you know
[50:12] and you get ready to read the will and
[50:14] the person that wrote it sitting there
[50:15] well the lawyer is going to
[50:17] go I can't read this the guy's still
[50:20] here y'all not know he's in the
[50:23] room he had to be gone
[50:25] so Christ had to go away so he could
[50:28] come back and give us a
[50:30] will all right 2 Corinthians 3:1 says
[50:33] you're our Epistles written in our
[50:34] hearts known and read of all men for as
[50:36] much as you are manifestly declared to
[50:38] be the Epistle of Christ ministered by
[50:41] US Written not with ink but with the
[50:43] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[50:44] of stone but in fleshly tables of the
[50:48] heart wow who also hath made us able
[50:51] Ministers of the New Testament there is
[50:54] a bride there is a fivefold Ministry
[50:57] that will take us to Perfection God
[51:00] promised it as brother Dell said a long
[51:01] time ago they are
[51:03] predestinated to take somebody to a body
[51:07] change it will happen you can sit there
[51:10] and deny you can quit coming to church
[51:11] you can sit there and deny everything
[51:14] it'll
[51:15] happen you know why CU you can't change
[51:18] will and the will said it was going to
[51:22] happen that's what I put my faith in I
[51:24] don't put my faith me you and nobody
[51:26] else I put my faith right here that's
[51:28] right right here and that brother said
[51:30] Faith final resting place is right here
[51:34] right why I told that brother day was
[51:36] talking about Daniel 70 weeks I said you
[51:37] got to show it to me in the Bible the
[51:39] way you preach it well I got this I
[51:41] don't care about the quotes right
[51:44] sorry they stood one day and says we
[51:46] have Moses quote
[51:48] book Jesus said if you didn't known
[51:50] Moses You' know me cuz in that quotebook
[51:53] you got I'm in it I'm just now in flesh
[51:56] and you can't see it that's why they
[51:59] hated him that's why I killed him they
[52:00] killed him and they'll persecute us the
[52:02] same way cuz the son of man's going to
[52:03] be back again in power I believe that
[52:06] with all my
[52:08] heart
[52:10] amen where we'll speak the word and
[52:12] it'll happen you don't have to pray and
[52:13] work something
[52:16] up boy why get
[52:19] silent Peter and James were walking down
[52:22] a
[52:23] road they weren't in a prayer meeting
[52:25] they probably were coming back from
[52:29] Walmart with in their
[52:32] car no they were walking probably
[52:34] talking about the Lord and talking about
[52:36] things and they look at a guy and see
[52:38] him sitting there and he can't get up
[52:41] he's been there for day for years arms
[52:44] for the poor arms for the
[52:47] poor Peter said hey look on
[52:52] us he said I ain't got enough money in
[52:54] my pocket I'm sure Peter probably had
[52:56] holes in his pocket he a fisherman
[53:00] unlearned he didn't go he said man I got
[53:03] I got $20 here go to the doctor and get
[53:05] that fixed he said Silver and Gold Have
[53:07] i n but such as I already
[53:11] have I ain't got to go get it what I
[53:15] have I give to you rise up on your feet
[53:18] and walk in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:20] didn't have to work anything up there
[53:22] wasn't a bunch of music in the
[53:23] background right
[53:27] amen who also has made us able Ministers
[53:30] of the New Testament not of the letter
[53:32] but of the spirit for the letter kth but
[53:35] the spirit giveth life like what Brother
[53:38] Richard negr was saying the other day
[53:39] you know he was he knew he had the
[53:41] spirit he was looking for the
[53:43] truth but when he saw the message being
[53:46] preached here he saw spirit and truth
[53:48] and put them together and he said that's
[53:49] the person I need to listen to How many
[53:51] of you got that
[53:52] Revelation not to one person but but the
[53:55] ministry is what you got to listen to
[53:58] for if the ministration of condemnation
[54:00] be glory dos and don'ts much more do the
[54:04] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[54:07] glory praise God for
[54:10] Grace that's what God brought he brought
[54:13] Grace there was even Grace in the Old
[54:15] Testament David would have
[54:18] died had it not been for grace of a
[54:21] prophet saying David you won't die
[54:23] that's right cuz David proclaimed as a
[54:26] king he proclaimed his own judgment on
[54:29] himself that's right remember that's
[54:32] right the prophet Nathan gave him the
[54:33] whole scenario and he said oh bring him
[54:35] here to that man will die Nathan said
[54:38] you're the
[54:39] man but David I prayed for you praise
[54:42] God we had a prophet pray for us amen
[54:45] we'll make it we'll make
[54:48] it but in those sacrifices there's
[54:50] remembrance again made of sin every year
[54:53] each each time you talk about in the old
[54:54] test Testament for it's not possible
[54:56] that the blood of bulls and the goats
[54:57] should take away sins wherefore when he
[54:59] cometh into the world he sayith
[55:01] sacrifice and offerings over here thou
[55:03] wouldest not but now I need a body I got
[55:05] to have a body to work through all right
[55:08] and you and I now are that body that he
[55:10] has prepared on the Earth
[55:13] today to defeat Satan
[55:16] with and burnt offering the sacrific for
[55:18] sin thou had us no pleasure then I say
[55:20] Lord I come in the volume of the book it
[55:22] is written of me to do thy will it was
[55:24] already in the well it's in the well now
[55:27] how God's going to orchestrate this
[55:29] whole thing through me and you
[55:33] amen then he said lo I come to do thy
[55:35] will oh God he taketh away the first
[55:37] that he may establish in other words
[55:39] don't do away with the Old Testament
[55:41] listen don't do away with all these
[55:43] ordinances I know Paul said you know um
[55:46] getting rid of all you don't get rid of
[55:48] the word of God you build on the word of
[55:51] God all right let us go on to Perfection
[55:54] Paul says not laying again you know all
[55:56] the different things of of water baptism
[55:58] and all that yeah you don't need you
[55:59] don't have to preach water baptism every
[56:01] service but you do kind of weave it in
[56:04] every once in a while for the ones that
[56:06] need it then he said lo I come to do thy
[56:08] will oh God he taketh away the first
[56:10] that he may establish the second but
[56:12] this man after he offered one sacrifice
[56:15] for sin forever he sat down on the right
[56:17] hand of God what is the right hand of
[56:19] God the power where is the power of God
[56:21] at the
[56:22] moment didn't the bride right
[56:26] what you you tell me where it is
[56:27] anywhere
[56:32] else right see you ought to know it's in
[56:36] US amen it's not anywhere else that's
[56:39] right from henceforth expecting until
[56:42] his enemies be made his foot stols and
[56:44] how is he going to do that through his
[56:46] bride for by one offering Heath
[56:48] perfected forever them that are
[56:50] Sanctified Hebrews 10:19 said by a New
[56:53] and Living Way We read this before which
[56:55] he had consecrated for us through the
[56:57] veil that is to say his flesh so
[56:59] everything's coming through his
[57:01] flesh everything she is him all the
[57:03] scriptures speaks to the bridegroom
[57:05] speaks to the bride we we've had a
[57:06] prophet tell us that and Proclaim it so
[57:08] let's believe it all
[57:11] right Revelations 1: 18 says I am Alpha
[57:14] and Omega the beginning and the ending
[57:15] sayith the Lord which is and which was
[57:17] and which is to come the almighty then
[57:19] John continues down and until he's one
[57:22] more time verse 11 I am Alpha and Omega
[57:24] the first and the last all right what
[57:27] thou see us right in the book now and
[57:28] send it to the seven churches Ephesus
[57:30] Smyrna all the way through so so God
[57:33] didn't just say all right give it to
[57:35] Ephesus and give it to leosa no you're
[57:38] going to give it to all seven but my
[57:40] first one is going to be important
[57:42] because that's the way I want my church
[57:43] to start and the last one I will restore
[57:47] sayith the Lord he's going to restore
[57:50] back right here right in this age we're
[57:53] living in now amen
[57:58] then he turned around saw the seven
[58:00] candlesticks as we were showing try to
[58:02] skip through now remember I think we all
[58:05] understand that that that person that
[58:07] was standing there that John saw was in
[58:09] a form called The Bride G about the
[58:13] pouch a belt of gold around this breast
[58:16] not down here not priest but up here
[58:20] through the bride brother Brown says
[58:22] look G about the PS not a man a woman
[58:25] called the son of
[58:27] man all right he was not a priest during
[58:30] this time neither was he a king he was a
[58:32] judge see listen who crowns him king of
[58:36] kings and Lord of
[58:40] lords the foolish
[58:43] virgin cup of water in my name Person
[58:46] giv eternal life at why Throne judgment
[58:48] who crowns him King of Kings we
[58:52] do then he shares that with us
[58:55] cuz we have crowns too
[58:57] remember notice the priest the high
[58:59] priest when he went to the sanctuary and
[59:00] went to minister to service he tied
[59:02] himself around the waist tying his
[59:04] girdle around the waist meant he was in
[59:05] service never tied it over his shoulder
[59:08] but here he comes out walking out with
[59:10] the girdle tied around the top with a
[59:11] sash over his shoulder gted about the PS
[59:14] the breast with a golden girdle gted up
[59:17] high what is he attorney an attorney a
[59:20] judge the judge with his sash over his
[59:21] shoulder GED up here not down as a
[59:24] priest now now watch what brother R he
[59:26] interjects now an
[59:28] attorney what is an
[59:30] attorney he can be for you or he can be
[59:32] against you but if the attor attorney
[59:36] the judge the jury are all the same
[59:38] person he can't
[59:41] change so he's for you the whole time
[59:45] amen the judge with his sash over his
[59:48] shoulder gted up here not down as a
[59:50] priest see that shows he wasn't in his
[59:51] priesthood
[59:53] now John all the way over into the
[59:55] Lord's day and saw him coming as the
[59:59] judge mark of the beast 1954 now I'm
[1:00:03] going to pull the chart back up here in
[1:00:04] just a minute we found the church
[1:00:06] standing there in its beauty Christ just
[1:00:07] molded into it he's talking about
[1:00:08] Revelations chapter
[1:00:10] 1 and the church had a white garment on
[1:00:12] and you notice it was a woman around the
[1:00:15] breast it had the Garment covering over
[1:00:16] her shame and had a golden cord though
[1:00:19] pulled around like that held around the
[1:00:21] breast white speaking of the
[1:00:23] righteousness of Christ and the golden
[1:00:25] cord representing the gospel the
[1:00:27] preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy
[1:00:30] Spirit over the
[1:00:32] church the righteousness of Christ
[1:00:35] that's what we come to church for not to
[1:00:37] see each other not to be seen not to be
[1:00:40] heard but we can talk to God and he can
[1:00:44] talk to
[1:00:47] us brings the Holy Spirit over the
[1:00:49] church the righteousness of Christ holds
[1:00:51] it there tied with the string the girdle
[1:00:54] TR in time of evangelism now let's set
[1:00:58] forth the ages here real quick and then
[1:00:59] we'll get down from omiga each age has
[1:01:02] had its message and its messenger all
[1:01:05] through the times every age has packed
[1:01:07] its message with a messenger god in
[1:01:09] every dispensation has sent forth
[1:01:11] someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:01:14] not a different Holy Spirit but Anointed
[1:01:16] with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his
[1:01:19] message for that age every time all
[1:01:23] right even from the beginning watch this
[1:01:25] I didn't read this this morning even
[1:01:26] from the beginning God was the messenger
[1:01:30] in the beginning now I ask you a
[1:01:32] question did they do what he
[1:01:35] said no they did not do what he said God
[1:01:40] himself told them eat of this one don't
[1:01:43] eat of that one they went right over
[1:01:45] there and ate that
[1:01:49] one you shall eat this but you shall not
[1:01:51] do this that was the message all right
[1:01:54] so see that was a
[1:01:56] message all right they didn't come under
[1:01:58] their
[1:01:59] messenger and what happened death
[1:02:02] happened
[1:02:03] right that was the message and when man
[1:02:06] stepped across the message of the hour
[1:02:08] it brought death and chaos to the whole
[1:02:10] human race now that's how much the
[1:02:12] message
[1:02:14] means and remember that wasn't just a
[1:02:16] complete blank denial of what God said
[1:02:19] that he believed it was taking what God
[1:02:21] Said and whitewashing it over or just
[1:02:23] misconstruing it a little bit just
[1:02:25] adding a little bit or taking a little
[1:02:26] bit from it
[1:02:29] 1963 God gave his word so much here so
[1:02:32] much here so much here he's look I
[1:02:34] believe he's pointing at the church ages
[1:02:36] and he sent a prophet down anointed to
[1:02:38] make that word come to pass and it
[1:02:40] supports the other one that was coming
[1:02:43] brother B never denied Luther he never
[1:02:45] denied all them he used every one of
[1:02:49] them because God was in every move that
[1:02:52] there
[1:02:53] was and and then he sent a prophet down
[1:02:55] anointed to make that word come to pass
[1:02:57] and it supports the other one that was
[1:02:59] coming see like the Messiah always
[1:03:01] supported every prophet in his own life
[1:03:04] his own being the word that was given
[1:03:05] for that day he come and fulfill that
[1:03:08] written word and foretold of what the
[1:03:11] other one was going to be now who the
[1:03:13] brother around now I'm going to ask you
[1:03:14] a
[1:03:15] question who did he
[1:03:18] foretell the coming of an end time
[1:03:22] bride the coming of an end time bride
[1:03:25] that was going to be the final voice of
[1:03:26] the final
[1:03:27] age not just one person standing up no
[1:03:30] no that brother Brandon was the prophet
[1:03:33] all right the holy ghost is now the
[1:03:34] prophet he was in every age anyway and
[1:03:37] every one of them spoke of him he was
[1:03:39] the head of the prophets he was the word
[1:03:40] of God he was the prophets notice how
[1:03:42] wonderful what he was each one of these
[1:03:44] prophets now let's continue on
[1:03:49] down only one messenger for each age
[1:03:52] receives what the spirit has to say to
[1:03:54] to that age and that one messenger is
[1:03:56] the messenger look to the true church
[1:03:59] cuz what he's going to do is once he
[1:04:01] sounds his message he is immediately
[1:04:04] going to cause a
[1:04:07] war like some of y'all are
[1:04:12] losing the Sleepy
[1:04:16] War but he's bringing a message and the
[1:04:18] true church is going to take it and and
[1:04:20] they're going to be what they're going
[1:04:22] to be blessed by iten but everybody else
[1:04:25] it starts a spiritual war and then I'll
[1:04:28] read it to you in a minute brother R
[1:04:29] says a temporary judgment is placed even
[1:04:32] on the earth listen the reason a lot of
[1:04:34] these things has happened in the United
[1:04:35] States brother Ram said it would
[1:04:37] happen there's nowhere in the Bible that
[1:04:40] says there'll be an earthquake that'll
[1:04:41] destroy California right but there'll be
[1:04:44] earthquake in diverse places is in the
[1:04:46] Bible right many diverse many places
[1:04:49] that' be earthquake had one just the
[1:04:51] other day did you read that yesterday I
[1:04:52] meant to call Claude I think he must
[1:04:54] have fell out of the bed he was a 5.1 in
[1:04:56] Oklahoma City I'll call him and ask him
[1:04:59] I was going to yesterday but I didn't
[1:05:00] have time but they had in Oklahoma City
[1:05:04] right in the middle of the United States
[1:05:05] of America a 5.1 earthquake shook stuff
[1:05:07] all over the place wow earthquakes in
[1:05:11] diverse places but brother R stood that
[1:05:14] day and he said oh Los Angeles thou City
[1:05:17] of Angels in other words he what he was
[1:05:19] saying was what I preached in
[1:05:23] California you have turned it down and
[1:05:25] God is going to put a judgment on you
[1:05:28] cuz he's not going to slide Georgia and
[1:05:30] Tennessee and all them off and they're
[1:05:32] going to be slid off cuz they turned the
[1:05:34] word
[1:05:37] down the message is then broadcast to
[1:05:39] all now
[1:05:41] look brings to the true church he speaks
[1:05:44] for God by Revelation to the church is
[1:05:46] though he preached to the denominational
[1:05:48] churches both true and false the message
[1:05:51] is then broadcast to all but though it
[1:05:54] is broadcast for all who come within
[1:05:56] range of the message that message is
[1:05:59] received individually by only a certain
[1:06:02] qualified group in a certain
[1:06:05] way each individual of that group is one
[1:06:08] who has the ability to hear what the
[1:06:09] spirit is saying by the way of the
[1:06:12] messenger those who here are not getting
[1:06:14] their own private Revelation nor is a
[1:06:17] group getting their Collective
[1:06:18] Revelation but each person is hearing
[1:06:20] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:06:22] already received from God
[1:06:25] amen the first
[1:06:28] seal now brother br's getting ready to
[1:06:30] preach the seals the first Seal's coming
[1:06:31] up he's he's going to set everything in
[1:06:33] order because he's already preached the
[1:06:34] church ages and he preached the breach
[1:06:36] between the church ages and the seals
[1:06:37] he's going to bring this and put them
[1:06:38] all together so just shake yourself for
[1:06:40] a moment and hang on now notice but it's
[1:06:43] to be revealed when the lamb leaves his
[1:06:45] intercessory place from the father now
[1:06:47] that's Revelations 5 now he takes the
[1:06:49] book of seals the book of seals are a
[1:06:51] book sealed with seals breaks them and
[1:06:53] shows them at the End of the Age now
[1:06:56] after the intercessory is over the
[1:06:58] church ages has done finished up he
[1:07:00] comes in the first age the he an age
[1:07:02] revealed sent a messenger notice what
[1:07:05] happens as we go along now listen pay
[1:07:07] attention this is going to help us when
[1:07:09] we get through the go through the church
[1:07:10] ages it's going to give you the
[1:07:11] character of what's going to happen all
[1:07:12] right here's the plan of it the first
[1:07:15] thing happens there's an announcement in
[1:07:17] the heavens first John I'm sending seven
[1:07:21] Messengers to seven Church agents right
[1:07:25] right that's what I'm going to do not
[1:07:28] doing anything different that's what I'm
[1:07:29] going to
[1:07:30] do what happened a seal is
[1:07:35] opened what is that a mystery is
[1:07:40] unfold let me give you a little
[1:07:43] secret Paul I don't think he thought I
[1:07:45] am the first church A's Messenger to
[1:07:48] Ephesus irenius probably didn't wake up
[1:07:50] one day and said I am the church AIDS
[1:07:53] messenger
[1:07:54] to Smyrna I'm and then they're all going
[1:07:57] I'm the no they didn't they just lived a
[1:07:59] life Abraham just lived his life okay
[1:08:02] the only thing we done is now we're at
[1:08:04] the end looking back and we've got a
[1:08:06] prophet in the end time that told us who
[1:08:08] these people were you can see the
[1:08:10] characteristics and the continuity of
[1:08:12] God in each one of the church
[1:08:15] ages when a mystery unfolds a trumpet
[1:08:18] sounds what a
[1:08:20] message it declares a war
[1:08:25] when Jesus came on Earth there was a
[1:08:29] war you know the Prince of Peace one day
[1:08:31] he stood up and he he said I didn't come
[1:08:32] to bring
[1:08:34] peace hello he said I come to bring a
[1:08:37] sword mother against father sister
[1:08:40] against brother he knew it would divide
[1:08:42] him but there was nothing he could do
[1:08:44] about it he had to come and preach the
[1:08:45] word brother R knew the denominations
[1:08:47] would throw him out Paul knew he'd be
[1:08:49] stoned Paul knew he probably was going
[1:08:51] to get his head cut off
[1:08:55] what is the war a plague Falls and a
[1:08:57] church age open see what is the war part
[1:09:02] the angel of the church now watch
[1:09:05] catches the mystery of God now look not
[1:09:08] the mystery of all the
[1:09:10] denomination he gets the revelation of
[1:09:13] God so immediately he's going to be
[1:09:16] separated from that church over there
[1:09:18] not just without that one I mean from
[1:09:20] the church he come out of like Luther
[1:09:24] but look not fully yet
[1:09:27] revealed but when he does he catches
[1:09:29] this mystery of God then he goes forth
[1:09:32] to the people after mystery has been
[1:09:34] given to him Goes Forth to the people
[1:09:38] what does he do out there he begin he
[1:09:42] proclaims his message and what does it
[1:09:44] start it starts a spiritual
[1:09:48] war and then God takes his messenger
[1:09:51] with that elect of that age Lays them
[1:09:53] away of sleep drops a plague upon them
[1:09:57] who rejects
[1:09:58] it a temporary
[1:10:01] judgment there's your Sevenfold
[1:10:05] person cuz remember he was
[1:10:07] judge and then after that is over then
[1:10:10] he goes on and they denominate bring in
[1:10:13] denominations and start off with that
[1:10:16] man's work like Wesley and all the rest
[1:10:18] of them then it gets all in a scrapple
[1:10:21] again because you got a church age
[1:10:23] messenger comes he preaches he goes off
[1:10:26] the scene and as soon as he goes off the
[1:10:32] scene irenius picks the message
[1:10:38] up has a Revival brings a group how a
[1:10:42] how a spiritual
[1:10:44] war
[1:10:47] irus God says all right Martin it's your
[1:10:50] time Martin takes what ireneus has and
[1:10:53] he keeps they keep
[1:10:54] pulling right pull from the other one
[1:10:58] listen they're not Church a messengers
[1:11:00] of Faith did Ne one before right right
[1:11:04] they can't do that that's right that's
[1:11:06] why polycarp would have been according
[1:11:09] to brother brandham he would have been
[1:11:10] one of the church A's Messengers but he
[1:11:12] said the Holy Spirit revealed to him
[1:11:14] that as in Paul he got away from all
[1:11:17] that stuff and and polycarp just leaned
[1:11:19] a little bit toward organized religion I
[1:11:21] said leaned a little toward it
[1:11:24] so he wasn't a church age messenger but
[1:11:26] ireneus didn't all right and then
[1:11:29] another mystery comes forth what happens
[1:11:31] another messenger arrives on Earth for a
[1:11:33] church age then he arrives the trumpet
[1:11:36] sounds he declares a war and then what
[1:11:39] happens finally then he's caught away
[1:11:41] and then when he's laid away then
[1:11:43] plagues fall destroys them listen
[1:11:47] spiritual death hits the church as soon
[1:11:48] as that church a messenger as soon as
[1:11:50] you turn him
[1:11:52] down you've turned God down youve turned
[1:11:55] God down you not turn that messenger
[1:11:57] down right then people that saying all
[1:11:59] brother around this and that they're
[1:12:01] turning God down they're not turning him
[1:12:02] down
[1:12:04] right spiritual death hits the church
[1:12:07] and she's gone that group then he goes
[1:12:10] on to another one Revelations 1 ver8 I
[1:12:13] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:12:14] end sayith the Lord which is which was
[1:12:17] and which is to come the almighty saying
[1:12:20] I am Alpha verse 11 and Omega the first
[1:12:23] and the last what thou seeth right in
[1:12:25] the book and send it unto the seven
[1:12:27] churches in Asia then he names them
[1:12:29] all now listen the alpha church was what
[1:12:34] Ephesus right everybody with
[1:12:37] me the Omega Church is leosia everybody
[1:12:41] with me the alpha the beginning and the
[1:12:45] end beginning and ending of the Gentile
[1:12:49] dispensation there was a beginning on
[1:12:50] the day of Pentecost then there's going
[1:12:52] to be an ending with us going into
[1:12:54] Rapture all
[1:13:00] right let's read this right here now if
[1:13:04] you'll notice the candlesticks didn't
[1:13:06] set quite like that they started down in
[1:13:07] this way and came up as we were showing
[1:13:10] a minute ago the highest one here away
[1:13:12] from here he was standing was this one
[1:13:14] up here and Christianity gradually
[1:13:15] smothered out watch this Christianity
[1:13:18] gradually smothered out as it went from
[1:13:20] where he was in the standing in the
[1:13:21] shape of the Cross Alpha
[1:13:24] Omega these Church ages started going
[1:13:29] down
[1:13:38] right see
[1:13:39] that that white in that little
[1:13:42] ball is is the the
[1:13:45] Believers this is the unbelief this is
[1:13:48] the Believers of the world this is the
[1:13:49] unbelievers look how it keeps taking
[1:13:52] over till you get to this age then it
[1:13:55] starts getting a little more light and I
[1:13:56] remember brother BR was one it drew
[1:13:57] light this was supposed to be totally
[1:14:00] dark praise God for a prophet amen that
[1:14:03] could do that and God was didn't say no
[1:14:05] no no don't do that he said uh that's
[1:14:07] what you should have done but you see
[1:14:09] how it took
[1:14:10] over n and all the different ones the
[1:14:12] sayings the Deeds the doctrin we'll get
[1:14:14] into all that later on but it almost
[1:14:17] comes completely out in Columba that
[1:14:18] middle
[1:14:19] age the fourth age all right so you got
[1:14:24] Ephesus we look Paul arenus Martin
[1:14:26] Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah the
[1:14:29] Seven Stars and we'll show you on
[1:14:32] another chart later on how that works
[1:14:34] because remember brother R said the
[1:14:35] messenger comes at the end of the age
[1:14:37] all right to what to enter to do what I
[1:14:39] said bring his message rebuke the
[1:14:41] previous ones bring his message start a
[1:14:44] war have a spiritual war that war
[1:14:47] continues on and then you have another
[1:14:49] messenger coming up all right but we
[1:14:51] don't have one
[1:14:54] so we're
[1:14:56] it this is it we're
[1:14:59] it Coca-Cola is not it we
[1:15:06] are all right so now let's read real
[1:15:12] quick now right here he had his hand on
[1:15:14] this church and on that
[1:15:19] church he was both Alpha and Omega and
[1:15:22] of course all was in between the two all
[1:15:26] the other letters the letters that were
[1:15:28] written all right everybody with me so
[1:15:29] he's not denying that God wasn't in
[1:15:31] those Church ages he's just saying God's
[1:15:33] got his hand on this one to start it
[1:15:35] right God has got his hand on this one
[1:15:37] to end it right all right listen it
[1:15:41] didn't begin with the false Doctrine
[1:15:43] it's not going to end with
[1:15:45] one
[1:15:50] amen but he specifically said Alpha and
[1:15:54] Omega he had a rainbow over his head
[1:15:56] which was what his Covenant now if you
[1:15:59] notice the light of Pentecost where it
[1:16:01] started gradually smothered out now we
[1:16:04] just showed it to you these men irenius
[1:16:06] polycarp he even announced his polycarp
[1:16:08] because polycarp was part of it but he
[1:16:09] wasn't a messenger all the rest of them
[1:16:11] sealed their testimony with their own
[1:16:13] blood until it finally squeezed
[1:16:16] Christianity into the darkest of days
[1:16:19] now look the first age the other side of
[1:16:22] that great hump coming over was a little
[1:16:25] bit of light more light than more light
[1:16:28] then how it begins to shine again coming
[1:16:30] into that day now at the end of this age
[1:16:33] it's predicted here that it come to a
[1:16:36] lay out of sin a lukewarm I like what
[1:16:39] brother um Isaac was bringing he's been
[1:16:42] going through the church ages if you'll
[1:16:43] look I look back in the in the history
[1:16:46] Lea is here and then there's two other
[1:16:47] cities right here Lea did not have any
[1:16:51] water they had no water system
[1:16:53] right they depended on the other two
[1:16:55] well one of them was in hot
[1:16:58] spring and one of them was cold deep
[1:17:00] well and they pumped it to lay out of se
[1:17:02] but when you take hot water and cold
[1:17:04] water and put it together what do you
[1:17:05] get
[1:17:07] lukewarm they drank literally those
[1:17:10] people in that age drank lukewarm
[1:17:15] water now here it is first thing he did
[1:17:18] to them why why would we want that down
[1:17:22] here in Pentecost talking about lukew
[1:17:23] why would we want it down here sardian
[1:17:26] Church age then if that was Christ's
[1:17:28] Holy Spirit coming on to the day of
[1:17:29] Pentecost now look that did those things
[1:17:32] it's Christ's Holy Spirit been pushed
[1:17:34] out through the church ages Christ's
[1:17:36] Holy Spirit still holding in here Christ
[1:17:39] Holy Spirit still holding here on down
[1:17:41] here until the end of the world the same
[1:17:44] holy spirit that filled Paul with the
[1:17:46] Holy Ghost and the things that he done
[1:17:48] will fill this one irenius full of the
[1:17:50] Holy Ghost Martin full of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:52] fill the rest of them full of the Holy
[1:17:53] Ghost and it filled you and I full of
[1:17:56] the Holy Ghost and it's a Pentecostal
[1:17:58] blessing from one Church
[1:18:01] age to the other Alpha and Omega the end
[1:18:05] and the beginning Philadelphian Church
[1:18:07] age brother R said look he had his hands
[1:18:09] out in the form of a cross he said I am
[1:18:11] Alpha and Omega in other words I will be
[1:18:13] Supreme in the
[1:18:15] first and I will be Supreme in the
[1:18:20] last the light rises in the east
[1:18:23] and sets in the west same light it's
[1:18:27] been a dismal dark time but it shall be
[1:18:29] light in the evening time the same
[1:18:32] Gospel Power that raised up here on one
[1:18:34] hand at the East has shined over and now
[1:18:36] on the other hand at the West Alpha and
[1:18:38] Omega I am I'm a and I am Z in his hands
[1:18:42] you get it now watch this now what did
[1:18:44] he do in the first chapter of
[1:18:46] Revelations he revealed his Supreme
[1:18:48] deity to the first church remember they
[1:18:52] they were were not trinitarians at all
[1:18:55] right
[1:18:57] none now it did start creeping in but
[1:19:01] none is that right well now notice every
[1:19:04] one of these churches coming down
[1:19:06] through here he revealed himself in
[1:19:08] deity what only in his glorified
[1:19:12] form not in his
[1:19:14] fullness that's where you can explain he
[1:19:16] came in his fullness here and he's
[1:19:19] coming back into his fullness here but
[1:19:21] down through the church ages he was in
[1:19:22] his glorified form he was in his bride
[1:19:24] but only in a
[1:19:26] portion but on this last one he becomes
[1:19:29] Z back to the original beginning again
[1:19:32] see the first and the last the first
[1:19:34] days now the last days where he said I
[1:19:35] am the first and the last Masterpiece
[1:19:39] 1964 brother rown said the first
[1:19:41] Ministry and the last Ministry is the
[1:19:45] same the first message and the second or
[1:19:48] last message is the same thing I was in
[1:19:51] Alpha I in Omega there'll be a day that
[1:19:54] won't be called day or night but in the
[1:19:55] evening time it shall be light see Alpha
[1:19:58] and Omega has become the first and the
[1:20:04] last back to the Masterpiece but you
[1:20:06] notice the church only came in he's
[1:20:08] talking about remember brother R had a
[1:20:10] vision saw one set of Bride come across
[1:20:14] into Vision right right
[1:20:18] then coming was the rock and roll twisty
[1:20:21] naked women look like a
[1:20:23] witch
[1:20:25] right coming in here twisting and
[1:20:28] turning and what going off into chaos
[1:20:31] then he was just so distraught he said
[1:20:33] Lord is this it is this
[1:20:35] all this all I've done is this it he
[1:20:38] said hang on a minute yeah the bride
[1:20:40] will come into preview again amen so
[1:20:44] here comes the bride that was dressed
[1:20:46] right amen so watch what he said but you
[1:20:50] notice the church only came into view
[1:20:52] one
[1:20:54] time church amen but the Bride come
[1:20:59] twice that's right Alpha Omega see what
[1:21:03] it is now not knowing it but look at it
[1:21:05] with my message this morning the seed
[1:21:08] fell in the ground at NAA that was the
[1:21:10] original seed and she's come through the
[1:21:11] process of these denominations which
[1:21:14] only comes in existence once but the
[1:21:16] bride returns back again in the last
[1:21:19] days I will restore see the Masterpiece
[1:21:21] is brought up
[1:21:23] that's the reason she is in view
[1:21:24] reviewed the second time she was
[1:21:27] reviewed the first time and she will be
[1:21:29] reviewed the second time she was
[1:21:31] perfectly the second time like she was
[1:21:34] the first time oh God have
[1:21:37] mercy all others never appeared no more
[1:21:40] they went out and never came back again
[1:21:42] but the bride came back cuz she was
[1:21:44] Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor
[1:21:47] has made him a masterpiece for is a
[1:21:49] piece of his it was a piece of his first
[1:21:51] masterpiece like he made in the Garden
[1:21:53] of Eden and took a piece from made
[1:21:55] another piece that was Mar and fell now
[1:21:57] he's been all this time building it up
[1:21:59] again and he brought forth this
[1:22:01] masterpiece and was smitten in order
[1:22:04] that part was smitten was in order to
[1:22:05] bring back again that Masterpiece again
[1:22:08] so the Masterpiece and the Son of God
[1:22:10] the Masterpiece and the Bride is a piece
[1:22:12] of him which must be the fulfilling of
[1:22:15] the word all
[1:22:19] right now if you got your Bibles we'll
[1:22:21] finish right here
[1:22:24] now what have I been telling for the
[1:22:25] last 30
[1:22:26] minutes

[1:22:30] Omega everybody with
[1:22:32] me Alpha bride and Omega bride that's
[1:22:35] the two that that's the two
[1:22:38] premere God said it four times in about
[1:22:41] three verses I mean three chapters I'm
[1:22:43] Alpha and I'm Omega all
[1:22:46] right open your Bible to Revelations
[1:22:51] 2 verse one
[1:22:53] if you don't have one that's okay cuz I
[1:22:54] got it up here for
[1:22:56] you I want you to watch cuz remember he
[1:22:59] said I started my church this way and
[1:23:01] I'm going to end it this way I'm going
[1:23:03] to have church in between but I'm going
[1:23:05] to specify these two churches amen all
[1:23:09] right watch how he had it written in the
[1:23:14] Bible all
[1:23:18] right you'll get your Bible out you wake
[1:23:21] up all right now look Revelations 2
[1:23:24] verse one first church age now watch now
[1:23:28] your Bible may not say this but this is
[1:23:30] the King James version I'm reading from
[1:23:31] all right unto the angel of the Church
[1:23:34] of Ephesus write is that what he says in
[1:23:38] yours yes now let's skip to Revelations
[1:23:43] 2:8 it
[1:23:48] changes and unto the angel of the church
[1:23:50] in Smyrna
[1:23:53] right anybody with
[1:23:56] Meen Revelations 2:12 to the angel of
[1:23:59] the church in pergamus say is that what
[1:24:03] he says in
[1:24:04] yours Revelations 2:18 the angel of the
[1:24:07] church in
[1:24:09] thara Revelations 3:1 says to the angel
[1:24:12] of the church in
[1:24:15] Sardis all right everybody got that
[1:24:17] Revelations
[1:24:18] 3:7 andto the angel of the church in
[1:24:21] Philadelphia
[1:24:24] so you would think that when we get to
[1:24:25] Revelations 3:14 it would say
[1:24:27] in it said in the other five except the
[1:24:31] first one first one said
[1:24:33] what
[1:24:36] of so now let's
[1:24:40] read Revelations 3:14 last Church AG
[1:24:43] unto the angel of the Church
[1:24:47] of the lead of sins
[1:24:49] right was samon the first right same in
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:54] last the other ones were
[1:24:58] in you didn't see that that's why I
[1:25:05] preach it's like Len y said he said why
[1:25:08] do you sing he said I sing for those
[1:25:09] that can and can't but mostly for the
[1:25:11] ones that can't
[1:25:13] so Ephesus was
[1:25:16] what the verbiage is different in
[1:25:19] Ephesus and leosia is the same but it
[1:25:21] during the other five it says in and see
[1:25:25] that might not be significant to you but
[1:25:26] God's word is exactly perfect he can't
[1:25:29] say I was Alpha and Omega and then bring
[1:25:31] them all
[1:25:32] together and to the angel of the Church
[1:25:35] of the loud of sins right
[1:25:40] Ephesians says what to the angel of the
[1:25:43] Church of
[1:25:45] Ephesus all the other ones are
[1:25:47] in Alpha and Omega the beginning the
[1:25:52] Beginning church and the ending Church
[1:25:55] you and I know the characteristics then
[1:25:58] of all the other Church ages but you
[1:26:00] should know that in this age the Bride
[1:26:03] of Jesus Christ is is and is acting like
[1:26:07] the bride in the first church
[1:26:08] age no denominational idea no theology
[1:26:12] no um uh getting away from the messenger
[1:26:16] like they're trying to do now right but
[1:26:18] Ephesus was the way God started his
[1:26:21] church there was a Pentecostal blessing
[1:26:24] fell on the day of Pentecost 120 people
[1:26:27] received the Holy Ghost the Ephesian
[1:26:29] Church age started some somewhere around
[1:26:31] there is everybody with
[1:26:32] me all right now we got over here in the
[1:26:35] end time and we'll show it in a little
[1:26:38] bit we got a seventh messenger over here
[1:26:42] what appears
[1:26:44] before the age
[1:26:48] begins
[1:26:49] Pentecost 1906 is USA Street
[1:26:53] the gifts are being restored back no
[1:26:55] messenger of the age brother rown said
[1:26:57] the Holy Ghost come himself then what
[1:27:00] then the L of In messenger steps on the
[1:27:02] scene just like Paul stepped on the
[1:27:04] scene right after
[1:27:08] Pentecost even brother brandham says and
[1:27:11] declares in 1950 on that tape that you
[1:27:13] can watch he says I was born out of due
[1:27:15] season born out of due time in other
[1:27:16] words I should have been born back in
[1:27:18] that Pentecostal age cuz no
[1:27:24] Paul is back here and he says the same
[1:27:26] thing if you'll look in the Bible I
[1:27:28] can't remember we'll get it later he
[1:27:29] says I was born out of due season in
[1:27:32] other words I should have been in the
[1:27:33] upper room that's why when we read that
[1:27:35] scripture in Corinthians about the about
[1:27:38] the U communion he wasn't
[1:27:41] there but he wrote the most clear of
[1:27:44] anybody that was there because the ones
[1:27:45] that were there didn't have the Holy
[1:27:47] Ghost right and the devil was among them
[1:27:50] right the devil to
[1:27:54] communion oh we don't have that
[1:27:57] today but there was a
[1:28:00] Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] and then the messenger com first one now
[1:28:05] there's a Pentecostal outpouring back in
[1:28:07] 1906 then a messenger come there's your
[1:28:10] two book ends there's your Alpha and
[1:28:12] Omega there's your of and
[1:28:15] of but everything else is truly the Holy
[1:28:19] Ghost don't don't get me wrong they all
[1:28:22] had the Holy Ghost all right one more
[1:28:26] quote let's stand to our
[1:28:28] feet come on in whoever's doing the
[1:28:33] communion now this is a uh when brother
[1:28:35] brownon went across a curtain of time he
[1:28:38] was talking to the angel and he said you
[1:28:40] were born a leader the angel says that
[1:28:43] and I said well will everyone be
[1:28:45] responsible he said every leader I said'
[1:28:48] what about St
[1:28:49] Paul why'd he pick Paul
[1:28:53] because he preached what Paul preached
[1:28:55] that's what he said I said what about St
[1:28:57] Paul said he'll be responsible for his
[1:28:59] AIDS well I said I preach the same
[1:29:01] gospel he did and millions of voices
[1:29:05] raised and said we are resting upon
[1:29:09] that see there you are
[1:29:12] resting so the angel of God the
[1:29:15] messenger to the church is
[1:29:17] responsible if he preaches not the
[1:29:20] word if he don't preach the word of God
[1:29:22] he's not a messenger but he's not he's
[1:29:24] responsible but the messenger to the
[1:29:26] church that preaches the truth he's
[1:29:28] responsible for his group of people all
[1:29:32] right you love the Lord that's how God
[1:29:35] is in
[1:29:36] continuity he's in his power in the
[1:29:38] beginning he's in power at the end
[1:29:39] they're going to have to match brother R
[1:29:42] couldn't preach now listen hold on a
[1:29:43] minute brother R couldn't preach come
[1:29:45] and preach Luther's
[1:29:46] message he preached about him preached
[1:29:50] through his message of justification
[1:29:52] everybody with me but he didn't say
[1:29:54] Luther's my
[1:29:56] man Luther had all of it he never said
[1:29:59] that but he said Paul
[1:30:02] did Paul's my man I preached everything
[1:30:04] Paul preached and everybody saying we're
[1:30:06] resting on that so he put his dependency
[1:30:08] on that he if he preached what Paul
[1:30:10] preached which was the alpha messenger
[1:30:12] then the Omega messenger must be him it
[1:30:15] must be something over here that he's
[1:30:17] doing if God thought enough for Paul to
[1:30:19] put him in a church age and put him in
[1:30:21] the in the uh sixth
[1:30:24] Dimension along with his people he said
[1:30:27] well if Paul made it cuz I preached
[1:30:29] exactly what Paul
[1:30:31] said he did he preached man he he
[1:30:33] preached exactly what Paul
[1:30:37] said then he was
[1:30:39] resting and we're
[1:30:41] resting that he did preach what Paul
[1:30:44] preached cuz Paul wrote 80% of the New
[1:30:47] Testament right you love the
[1:30:50] Lord
[1:30:54] can you pull that scripture up brother
[1:30:57] Anderson you back there and we'll go to
[1:30:59] the communion 1 Corinthians

[1:35:15] and he wasn't there that the Lord Jesus
[1:35:18] the same night in which he was betrayed

[1:35:23] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:35:26] remembrance of me after the same manner

[1:35:47] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:35:49] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:35:51] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:35:53] let a man examine
[1:35:55] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[1:35:57] drink of that cup for he that eateth and

[1:36:18] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:36:20] with the world in other words your

[1:37:00] that someone has been touched by Your
[1:37:02] Word Lord and we'll take this forward
[1:37:03] and defeat the Devil with it in Jesus
[1:37:05] name amen Bible said he took bread and
[1:37:08] blessed it dear Lord thank you so much
[1:37:11] we've come to this place where it's been
[1:37:13] dedicated to you Lord made by holy hands
[1:37:16] not made with anything but just water
[1:37:18] and and uh flour Lord and I pray that
[1:37:22] that's a symbol of the word we just
[1:37:24] preached that there was nothing added no
[1:37:26] leaven to make it rise and and Lord It's
[1:37:28] Made it's not made to be even to be
[1:37:32] something to desire we want to eat every
[1:37:33] meal it should be something that Taken
[1:37:35] like you did Lord on the cross Lord they
[1:37:37] tried to give you vinegar and and you
[1:37:40] you didn't take it Lord because you told
[1:37:42] us that you wern't going to do any of
[1:37:43] that drinking of the vine until we come
[1:37:46] to the end father I pray that you'd
[1:37:48] sanctify this in Jesus name amen
[1:37:53] yeah it's interesting to uh um even the
[1:37:58] ordinances um that they did back
[1:38:02] then how it got convoluted and then now
[1:38:05] they just take cut over grape juice and
[1:38:08] and uh and they you know order some uh
[1:38:12] something from the uh looks like a
[1:38:14] little bitty puffy little cracker and
[1:38:18] and that's the way they've done with the
[1:38:19] word of God they've diluted it so much
[1:38:22] from the
[1:38:23] original till it don't even look like
[1:38:25] the original now
[1:38:27] listen the original church we should
[1:38:29] look like that original church that's
[1:38:32] why we dress the way we do and act the
[1:38:34] way we do it's because we're back to the
[1:38:37] original everything in between God
[1:38:39] winked at ignorance absolutely but now
[1:38:41] remember what God say though but when
[1:38:43] the word presented to you what are you
[1:38:45] going to do with it all right when the
[1:38:48] word presented to you what are you going
[1:38:49] to do with it cuz you can't say I I you
[1:38:51] didn't tell me that
[1:38:53] no like I said before you know it
[1:38:56] there's ordinances in this church and I
[1:38:58] don't say this church building in the
[1:39:01] church that brother Brown put in place
[1:39:04] by the scripture to tell us how to run a
[1:39:07] church and pretty simple you ain't got
[1:39:10] to ask nobody else you ain't got to ask
[1:39:12] another bishop or somebody like
[1:39:14] that you got the word of God to do it
[1:39:16] with and you got the prophet's message
[1:39:18] to give us Clarity he come to bring us
[1:39:21] another Bible he come to give us Clarity
[1:39:23] to what was already been written so we
[1:39:25] don't live under another book we live
[1:39:27] under the Bible but it's the Hess of the
[1:39:29] completeness of the Bible Lord Jesus
[1:39:31] thank you for this wine father it was a
[1:39:33] privilege to make it Lord and watch it
[1:39:35] ferment and work Lord I pray that you
[1:39:36] sanctify it to the people and they'll
[1:39:39] realize Lord that that this fruit of the
[1:39:41] vine Lord gets better and better it it
[1:39:43] doesn't get worse it gets better father
[1:39:45] the same way with the word of God it
[1:39:46] just keeps getting better and better
[1:39:48] father just bless this in Jesus name
[1:39:50] amen

[1:40:14] [Music]

[1:40:18] the darkest time but for the Bel it's
[1:40:21] the brightest time what a
[1:40:23] paradox sometimes I'm
[1:40:26] despised and rejected true Christians
[1:40:29] are anyway and I question oh
[1:40:34] Father how
[1:40:37] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:40:44] Calvary and he gives me the strength to
[1:40:49] go on
[1:40:52] come morning boy what a
[1:40:54] morning it won't be another day when
[1:40:57] that when that morning comes brother
[1:40:58] John it'll be another it won't be
[1:40:59] another
[1:41:01] day we don't know what rest is we may
[1:41:04] take tonight and lay down a head on the
[1:41:06] pillow but your body still doing this
[1:41:08] your mind still doing this and when you
[1:41:10] get up the next morning sometimes you're
[1:41:12] as tired as you were when you went to
[1:41:13] sleep just think brother boy that ain't
[1:41:15] going to happen no more when that
[1:41:16] morning happens that we're just talking
[1:41:18] about right we can't even fathom
[1:41:22] that there won't be a
[1:41:24] Monday nowhere praise the Lord I got a
[1:41:27] word too guys our worst day on at the
[1:41:30] post office is on
[1:41:31] Monday
[1:41:33] but God's give us all this but he give
[1:41:37] us an example to do until he come all
[1:41:40] right don't ever think that we're too
[1:41:42] high and mighty that we don't have to
[1:41:44] take
[1:41:46] communion or do the ordinances of God
[1:41:49] brother Dale has always told us us he
[1:41:51] always told us he said if somebody's got
[1:41:53] a message and they bring a message and
[1:41:55] it don't line up with all the
[1:41:58] Bible if there some new thing and you
[1:42:01] ain't got to do this and you ain't got
[1:42:02] to do that and we're looking at sinless
[1:42:04] Perfection and we're looking at seven
[1:42:06] people coming and giv us seven messages
[1:42:08] and and all Christ has already come so
[1:42:11] we it doesn't matter how many wives we
[1:42:13] have and it doesn't matter about my
[1:42:14] marriage and divorce situation yeah it
[1:42:17] does this will be sticky until we get
[1:42:20] out of here like I said before to be a
[1:42:22] change like
[1:42:24] this that's when the sin curse will be
[1:42:26] over with not
[1:42:29] before come on not
[1:42:33] before as long as you needing to needing
[1:42:36] to eat and having bad
[1:42:40] thoughts you're not
[1:42:42] changed but there'll come a day
[1:42:47] amen I like that song There's coming
[1:42:49] today when no heartaches will come
[1:42:52] yes yeah
[1:42:58] sure yeah I
[1:43:09] know well that's why the scripture sets
[1:43:11] us apart from the world you see where it
[1:43:13] says the world has a condemnation if you
[1:43:16] if you just continue to in your brain
[1:43:18] and thought about right now well oh I
[1:43:21] run that guy off the road I I I I've
[1:43:23] said something about my sister or
[1:43:24] brother I shouldn't have done well like
[1:43:26] I said you got a chance to get it right
[1:43:29] but take communion but if you don't get
[1:43:31] it right the Bible says you eat and
[1:43:34] drink damnation to yourself and some of
[1:43:36] some people will fall asleep that means
[1:43:38] death if y'all didn't know that am
[1:43:40] sister
[1:43:49] Julie
[1:43:58] yeah I
[1:43:59] know
[1:44:07] okay confession good for the
[1:44:11] soul but it it my me it's not is not
[1:44:13] true though J both of you you come in
[1:44:16] here you you probably would couldn't
[1:44:18] even tell me what songs were sung at
[1:44:21] beginning of
[1:44:23] church see what I mean I didn't even
[1:44:26] clear mine with that beautiful preaching
[1:44:27] I just
[1:44:30] did I love
[1:44:33] honesty but no
[1:44:36] really we are human beings and we are
[1:44:40] human beings that we we we understand
[1:44:43] Humanity cuz that's what we
[1:44:45] are and if I was to just like when when
[1:44:49] Lise was singing only believe and I come
[1:44:51] from my car and walked in the door and
[1:44:54] just walked up here and stood in it'
[1:44:56] been a horrible
[1:45:00] thing put it back there go in your
[1:45:03] closet get rid of the stuff you say I
[1:45:06] can't get rid of it well that's the
[1:45:07] problem you can't get rid of it but if
[1:45:10] you give it to God and say look God I'm
[1:45:12] doing what you told me to do you told me
[1:45:15] to assemble myself with Believers you
[1:45:17] told me to come in the congregation and
[1:45:20] pray read my Bible and study and that
[1:45:23] you would visit us we wonder we wonder
[1:45:25] we say you know here I go again people
[1:45:29] that that that their lives are like I
[1:45:31] can't ever I can't this I can't I can't
[1:45:33] ever have you ever started trying to
[1:45:35] just do the little things cuz most of
[1:45:37] you that said that I don't see in church
[1:45:39] half the
[1:45:42] time start with the simple
[1:45:45] things the simple things cuz remember
[1:45:47] it's the little SP foxes that spoil the
[1:45:49] vine if we start with what brother rown
[1:45:52] say he said if you've done everything
[1:45:54] you know to do now every one of you know
[1:45:56] to be at church and every one of you
[1:45:57] need to need know that you need to be
[1:45:59] here 20 minutes ahead of time cuz that's
[1:46:00] what brother R said in
[1:46:02] 1950 most of us weren't even born during
[1:46:05] that time but he said if you've done
[1:46:07] everything you're supposed to
[1:46:10] do
[1:46:12] stand you just got to make sure you've
[1:46:14] done everything you're supposed to do
[1:46:16] you wonder why your world's in chaos
[1:46:18] ain't my
[1:46:19] fault
[1:46:23] ain't my fault ain't brother Dale's
[1:46:25] fault he's fault for 50 years Tred to
[1:46:27] get y'all straightened
[1:46:30] out he's done a good job amen people are
[1:46:34] learning people learning we we we've got
[1:46:36] a good foundation and we appreciate that
[1:46:39] we appreciate the the time that we're
[1:46:41] having now and sister Julie thank you
[1:46:42] for your honesty cuz you were the one I
[1:46:43] was talking
[1:46:47] about well they know that cuz they came
[1:46:49] in late
[1:46:52] but you see that though you don't think
[1:46:54] we stand up here and we're just like oh
[1:46:55] we're just going to preach and no we see
[1:46:57] a spirit we don't see a black thing you
[1:47:01] know I I pray God never let us see
[1:47:04] that or know the thoughts of your mind
[1:47:08] right but you can see reactions when you
[1:47:11] say something either your head goes
[1:47:14] down before you go to sleep even your
[1:47:17] head goes down or some will look over
[1:47:20] against the wall
[1:47:21] like I'm not really
[1:47:25] here I'm outside that door right
[1:47:30] there listen folks we're humans and
[1:47:33] we're one big family and we love each
[1:47:35] other but we have to be chasen just they
[1:47:38] didn't say we were chasen of the Lord
[1:47:40] and you have to be chasen through a
[1:47:42] minister that's why you need a live
[1:47:45] five-fold
[1:47:46] Ministry not press play people cuz you
[1:47:49] know what press play you can do it 30
[1:47:51] minutes after service starts you can be
[1:47:53] drinking coffee and watching YouTube oh
[1:47:55] sorry
[1:47:57] Netflix I don't
[1:48:00] have okay now work conf fasting let's go
[1:48:03] come on
[1:48:04] we you preach about it a lot so they
[1:48:06] assume you do so now they know you don't
[1:48:08] so you're preaching on somebody else's
[1:48:10] Spirit out there in the
[1:48:12] congregation right yes yeah that's right
[1:48:16] I used I know you
[1:48:18] did but that's what we do what the Bible
[1:48:21] say confess your sins what one to the
[1:48:25] other confess your sins one to the other
[1:48:29] the problem is is we go out there and we
[1:48:31] tell everybody else about what's going
[1:48:33] on in
[1:48:34] here when we're supposed to be judging
[1:48:37] here all right I'm sorry let's take
[1:48:40] communion you love the Lord you got to
[1:48:43] love his word and what he told us to
[1:48:49] do
[1:48:54] that Wine's not bad is
[1:49:02] it let's pull out the pull up the
[1:49:06] uhu scripture for the U foot washing CU
[1:49:09] that we believe in all the ordinances
[1:49:10] here we we believe that Jesus looked at
[1:49:13] Peter and he said if I don't do this to
[1:49:15] you and you don't do it to me you don't
[1:49:17] have no part with
[1:49:19] me
[1:49:22] i''d be like God going you know I said
[1:49:24] well I'm going to be in these Church
[1:49:25] ages I'm going on
[1:49:27] vacation no he was in everyone he worked
[1:49:31] in everyone thank God he doesn't get
[1:49:35] tired cuz he'd be real tired a lot of us
[1:49:38] me included right but he's not he's
[1:49:40] Bible said he's what longsuffering and
[1:49:43] we sang that song either today or or the
[1:49:45] other day I think it was today brother
[1:49:46] Aaron was singing it sister Gail always
[1:49:49] told me cuz you know we'd we'd be
[1:49:51] talking about something and she said now
[1:49:53] you know brother way God's arm is really
[1:49:56] long I said yes sister Gil but it does
[1:49:59] have an
[1:50:00] end his arm may be long but he's got a
[1:50:03] hand out there at the end of it and it's
[1:50:04] going to stop he's only going to put up
[1:50:07] with so much that's right so let's read
[1:50:09] the footw watching scripture let's just
[1:50:10] do his ordinance that listen if you love
[1:50:13] the Lord if if if he's your bridegroom
[1:50:15] if he's your husband do what he
[1:50:17] says and suffer being ended the devil
[1:50:20] having now put in the heart of Judas
[1:50:21] this carrot Simon's son to betray him
[1:50:23] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:50:25] all things into his hand and that he was
[1:50:26] come from God and went to God he rises
[1:50:30] from supper and laid aside His Garment
[1:50:31] and took a towel and GED himself what
[1:50:34] here servant he tied it around his waist
[1:50:37] he didn't tie it up here he tied around
[1:50:39] his waist as a
[1:50:40] servant after that he poured water into
[1:50:42] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:50:44] feet and to WIP him with a towel where
[1:50:46] withth he was GED then cometh he to
[1:50:48] Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord
[1:50:50] does thou wash my feet Jesus said unto
[1:50:52] him what I do thou knowest not now but
[1:50:54] Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said

[1:51:04] all right that and your grandkids Thou
[1:51:06] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
