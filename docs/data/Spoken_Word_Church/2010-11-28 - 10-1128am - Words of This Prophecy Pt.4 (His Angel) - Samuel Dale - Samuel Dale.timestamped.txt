[34:45] service cuz I surely don't want to miss
[34:47] a service you know I I I want to be here
[34:50] okay so just remember that the
[34:51] announcements is there we've made them
[34:54] you know and everything so uh keep these
[34:56] in mind we're glad to see some back that
[34:58] had been with us but we say they're not
[35:01] visitors cuz they've been here before
[35:03] but we appreciate them all right if you
[35:05] like turning your scriptures turn to
[35:06] Revelations
[35:12] 1 I haven't preached too awfully much in
[35:16] the
[35:17] past
[35:19] month and going into part of the next
[35:22] month not because we were gone but you
[35:24] know some of it was one weekend we was
[35:26] way but we wouldn't away just fooling
[35:28] around we were not hunting and all like
[35:31] that we were having a good time uh we
[35:34] were in the services there with brother
[35:37] Claude and brother Pinkston and Wade
[35:39] preached one Sunday at one and I
[35:41] preached the Sunday at the other one and
[35:44] then I was back preaching for brother
[35:46] Claude on Wednesday and Wade had the
[35:48] Sunday following Brother Pinkston so we
[35:50] had a good time just you know preaching
[35:52] and and they seem to enjoy the the
[35:55] fellowship and and all and had a good
[35:57] time with brother Jim and his his wife
[36:00] there hunting they just make us part of
[36:02] the family and everything but you know
[36:05] just pray that the Lord would help us
[36:07] okay Revelations 1 as I said to you in
[36:09] the Sunday school class I asked brother
[36:11] dick to get us up just a little bit
[36:12] early so you know you're you're still up
[36:15] and that's fine okay Revelations 1
[36:17] father we thank you we love you and we
[36:20] ask you Lord to just come on the scene
[36:22] now into our hearts and our lives that
[36:25] Lord we'd be able to to get ourselves
[36:27] out of the way this morning and be able
[36:29] to speak what you have given unto us
[36:32] amen and Lord you just come and then
[36:35] make it manifest cuz no matter what we
[36:37] could do no matter what we could say it
[36:39] wouldn't be worth anything unless you
[36:41] come and honor it and Lord just help us
[36:44] there's many uh sicknesses Among Us many
[36:47] things that Satan has tried to bring
[36:49] upon the people but yet Lord you are the
[36:53] one that will take care of all things
[36:55] and we believe you we thank you
[36:57] and we know that all things work
[36:59] together for good but sometimes we don't
[37:01] understand that Lord while we're going
[37:03] through it we we uh you know we kind of
[37:07] uh are human and we don't understand all
[37:11] the time but yet you help us and Lord
[37:13] just come now and speak to each one of
[37:14] our hearts and our lives that we may
[37:17] Lord speak what you'd have to be said
[37:19] and then Lord you reveal it because I
[37:23] can't we ask you to have the your way
[37:25] with each one now bless brother Luke
[37:27] there brother Luke Gibson Lord as he's
[37:30] had the chest pains and the things we
[37:32] pray that you'd take a bit of it away
[37:34] from him and let everything be all right
[37:36] and bless the family that lost the loved
[37:38] one and we just thank you for all things
[37:40] we know that in a time of trouble we can
[37:42] depend upon you guide each one of us now
[37:44] in Jesus name
[37:48] amen Revelations 1 now we've been
[37:51] reading this for a while and uh you know
[37:56] so we want to get into the message and
[37:59] try to uh uh you know understand a
[38:03] little okay Revelations
[38:06] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[38:10] God gave unto him to show unto his
[38:13] servants things which must shortly come
[38:16] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[38:19] his Angel unto his servant John who bear
[38:22] record of the word of God and the
[38:24] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[38:27] things that he sought blessed is he that
[38:30] readeth and they that hear the words of
[38:32] this prophecy and keep those things
[38:35] which are written therein for the time
[38:38] is at hand you may be seated the Lord at
[38:41] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[38:43] now we have a lot of quotes to be given
[38:46] out to
[38:47] you uh but we'll uh we will try not to
[38:52] uh burden you cuz we're going to shorten
[38:54] the service a little bit today and go
[38:56] ahead ahead and have her eats together
[38:58] because you know but what I'm going to
[39:00] do is probably this morning a lot of
[39:04] background and then just come up a
[39:06] little
[39:07] bit in the message to be able to
[39:11] understand
[39:13] now
[39:15] uh The Book of Revelation to to some of
[39:18] the new
[39:19] ones you know the church taught us I
[39:24] come up through the Baptist you know and
[39:26] was a deacon and all in the Baptist
[39:28] Church so I was there for quite a while
[39:30] and uh but you know we were told to stay
[39:34] away from The Book of Revelations cuz we
[39:36] couldn't understand it you know and told
[39:39] to stay out of Genesis because we
[39:41] couldn't follow what was going on
[39:42] because we didn't know but you know that
[39:46] was the devil with his scarecrow to try
[39:48] to scare us away from it you know to
[39:50] keep us from being able to uh you know
[39:53] to see and understand good see Dr Sher
[39:57] back there with us and uh you know to be
[39:59] able to
[40:02] uh follow the word of God right I
[40:06] believe all the word of God is inspired
[40:09] amen and then the reason Satan don't
[40:12] want you to read the book of Revelations
[40:15] is because it's a book written to
[40:18] you and it's about you right all right
[40:23] right because as I've often told you to
[40:26] do and I wish you would read it you know
[40:30] you read the book of Revelations and and
[40:32] you won't find Jesus Christ by
[40:36] himself you'll find him in different
[40:38] forms different ways different things
[40:41] but you won't find him just being
[40:45] byself you say well there was a lamb we
[40:48] haven't got there yet that's way over
[40:50] but what about the Lamb of God that took
[40:52] the book you know well you better read
[40:54] your Bible that Lamb of God had seven
[40:57] horns and seven eyes all right and that
[41:00] came from
[41:02] the bride of Christ down through the
[41:04] church ages so keep that in your mind as
[41:07] we try to to speak about it and then
[41:11] think about the Book of Revelations is
[41:13] being a book written personally to you
[41:16] that's right and it's written about you
[41:18] because see you've got a vast gap
[41:20] between uh say the book of Acts and the
[41:25] uh happening of the church in the book
[41:27] of Acts you know and then you've got the
[41:29] church ages but you've got about 2,000
[41:31] years almost in transpiring some 1900
[41:35] and something that maybe not a lot is
[41:38] said but then you get to the Book of
[41:40] Revelations and that's your book right
[41:43] amen now thank God for God sending us a
[41:46] prophet right because without a prophet
[41:49] we wouldn't have understood the
[41:51] symbolics that's right all right now a
[41:53] lot of it is plain language right you
[41:56] know
[41:56] I mean it's plain language it's written
[41:59] there in the Book of Revelations you
[42:00] know that doesn't even need to be
[42:02] interpreted because like the uh the uh
[42:05] where we'll get to it later you know
[42:07] where it talks about the seven golden
[42:08] candles he tells you that that's the
[42:10] messengers to the age and the church I
[42:13] mean there's a lot of it this this di
[42:15] but see we were
[42:17] scared to approach those things by the
[42:20] religious people who maybe ins sincerity
[42:24] but honesty you know
[42:27] uh they had those ideas but uh why do we
[42:30] worry about it now when God has revealed
[42:35] himself to us right and we follow a
[42:38] message that we don't have to worry
[42:40] about am but that's one thing that I'm
[42:43] wanting you to get is uh you know
[42:47] there's two factions that I see in the
[42:49] message or the hour people one group
[42:51] goes this way and one group goes this
[42:54] way all right one group group going one
[42:57] way they they throwed away their Bibles
[43:00] they they just took when they heard the
[43:02] prophet they they throw their Bibles
[43:04] basically away they they're laying there
[43:06] but they don't use them they just it's
[43:08] all what brother Bram said right without
[43:11] being able to say anything about the
[43:14] Bible that group going that way the
[43:16] other group goes this way that they wind
[43:18] up with well brother random come to turn
[43:21] us back to the word so now don't matter
[43:23] what he says it's what we say about the
[43:27] Bible all right now that's two two
[43:29] groups everything you always watching is
[43:32] always pulling this away pulling that
[43:34] way but I believe in going right down
[43:36] the middle of the road you know I I my
[43:39] wife gets on to me all the time because
[43:42] and when I'm driving down the road I'm
[43:44] running closer to the to the center line
[43:47] yes sir yes sir and and now I always get
[43:50] over when the car comes but I see
[43:52] somebody saying yeah they probably do it
[43:55] now Anna Anna drives over to the white
[43:57] line on the side she puts a vast Gap
[44:00] well others are saying that see because
[44:02] that's just the way you do it but I just
[44:04] you know the the the center of the road
[44:07] 99% of the people don't run close to the
[44:09] center so you know
[44:11] what you got a track on the highway that
[44:13] you run on right and basically everybody
[44:16] runs right you get in that
[44:18] track right why because it's wore out
[44:22] everybody's driving on it if you move
[44:24] over about 2 feet it's just as
[44:27] smooth
[44:29] right see because the center of the
[44:31] highway is made where all of the tries
[44:33] floats away from the center it's made up
[44:35] a little higher and if you lay your left
[44:38] hand up on the steering wheel and just
[44:40] keep a little tension on it it'll just
[44:42] follow that line cuz if you don't it's
[44:44] going to float over to
[44:46] the right cuz everybody's got it that
[44:49] way further north you go the more you
[44:50] know about it right but now my point is
[44:54] one thing
[44:56] I want to stay in the middle of the
[44:58] road and in the middle of the road then
[45:01] uh I don't have to worry about it and
[45:03] the mistakes I make God will cover for
[45:05] me when I don't understand and after 40
[45:08] Years of studying the message you know
[45:10] or more than that then uh you know I I
[45:14] don't have much worry about uh some of
[45:16] the things I say because after being
[45:18] around that long right you know you
[45:21] already to be able to have something
[45:22] settled that's what a lot of people says
[45:24] beware of that person got all the
[45:26] answers well I don't clim to have all of
[45:28] them I told you what I've got right I've
[45:32] told you before what it is a man that's
[45:34] got all the answers his head is so full
[45:36] of knowledge that he don't have no
[45:39] sense
[45:42] right like brother dick says you go into
[45:44] a place you know and you look around and
[45:46] our sets all of the
[45:47] bosses you know and they're doing the
[45:50] jacket would you look over in the corner
[45:52] and there that's an old guy with his Fe
[45:54] propped up probably don't even have a
[45:55] Time
[45:57] yes sir but you know who I want to talk
[46:00] to about the business that guy cuz them
[46:02] other guys don't know anything about
[46:05] it so you get a head full of knowledge
[46:07] you don't know how to do it then you
[46:09] know what my interpretation or thoughts
[46:11] is as long as I got contact with the one
[46:15] that's got the knowledge I don't have to
[46:17] have my brain to full sir cuz I don't
[46:20] have a lot of
[46:21] it so I depend upon the one that's got
[46:24] the answers then I just ask him amen and
[46:28] he tells me okay amen now you know who
[46:31] I'm talking about the prophet's message
[46:33] is the ones got the answers to it and he
[46:36] he didn't have the answers so God give
[46:37] him cuz I don't believe he's God now
[46:40] that's one thing I don't believe and you
[46:42] know and I said this group puts too much
[46:44] emphasis and this group don't put enough
[46:46] emphasis but let's follow the middle of
[46:48] the road to get down to to be able to
[46:51] see where we're at amen and what's going
[46:53] on but now remember this is a series
[46:57] I've been on this is message number four
[47:00] of words of this prophecy
[47:02] here
[47:04] all somebody got in in the back there we
[47:08] too have had some times now I'm glad
[47:10] that was brought that um we were
[47:12] listening to the services that while we
[47:15] were gone the other night my wife and I
[47:17] were and there was a tiny bit of Buzz so
[47:19] make sure that you musicians turn off
[47:21] all your instruments because some way is
[47:23] coming through and getting on the
[47:26] internet to where that you can hear a
[47:28] little in the background so maybe that's
[47:31] what that needs to be to where I
[47:32] remember to say it you know cuz my
[47:34] head's not full of knowledge I have to
[47:36] write myself notes okay bring all things
[47:38] your right but see what does it mean the
[47:42] the words of this
[47:44] prophecy now prophecy is foretelling
[47:48] future
[47:49] events all right now as I said the
[47:52] church
[47:53] ages the time
[47:56] and all like that John goes to patmas
[47:59] about ad 95 somewhere right in
[48:03] there and he's writing and he's about uh
[48:07] at least two years into the writing of
[48:09] that they argue over the 9395 and all
[48:12] like that that's no problem but I know
[48:14] he was there quite a while right and uh
[48:17] he was writing the Book of Revelations
[48:20] they put him out there because of the
[48:21] fact that he was trying to put the Bible
[48:23] down into terms that we could you know
[48:25] we can understand so when he got out
[48:28] there you know God comes to him and and
[48:31] he begins to reveal to him and he's
[48:34] revealing to him what has taken place
[48:37] that's the Book of Revelation and what
[48:40] has been SE and then he reveals what is
[48:44] and then he reveals the future okay
[48:48] that's the way John was there far he
[48:50] reveals all the way to the Future home
[48:53] you know it's brought to John oh on
[48:56] patas all right now in in doing that
[48:59] then see we can go back and
[49:02] read and we can understand what has been
[49:05] what is and what's going to be because
[49:07] of of of the fact of it being a prophecy
[49:10] y see which is a foretelling of future
[49:15] events now remember how we
[49:18] covered that you know I know we talk
[49:22] strange and and odd and a lot of people
[49:24] say need to understand this well um I do
[49:29] believe we need to understand you know
[49:34] and when we come to the Book of
[49:36] Revelations notice what it says the
[49:39] revelation of Jesus Christ now
[49:43] listen which God gave unto
[49:47] him
[49:50] Jesus to show unto his servants the
[49:53] things which shortly must come and he
[49:55] said and signified which signified means
[49:58] to make known you know or to to give a
[50:01] sign or an indication right but to make
[50:03] known and he said and signified by his
[50:07] Angel unto his servant
[50:10] John now John is the one to record right
[50:15] right
[50:16] right he's here only to record right
[50:20] okay now he's to record what he sees
[50:24] right he does the best he can and to
[50:25] write down what he sees all right so
[50:28] you're dealing with an angel coming to
[50:31] John but a revelation coming from God
[50:35] given to Jesus to give to the angel to
[50:38] give to John you say well boy that's
[50:41] trinitarianism no it's the correct order
[50:43] of the
[50:44] Bible it's exactly the way that uh it
[50:48] has to be cuz what's not Services now
[50:52] I'm asking you to do this write down
[50:54] your thoughts on the godhead write down
[50:57] your thoughts on uh you know and
[50:59] questions or ideas about the godhead
[51:02] because I intend to preach for the first
[51:04] time in uh 35 years I intend to preach a
[51:09] watch not service this time and what I
[51:13] intend to do is take about 4
[51:15] hours that's 8 to 12 right we're going
[51:18] to be here for something you know so we
[51:22] start off and have a little song service
[51:24] and then we we do don't you worry about
[51:26] it I won't be that long but uh then
[51:28] we'll get into the service and then
[51:30] we're going to have questions and
[51:32] answers am all right so you write down
[51:36] your questions about the
[51:38] godhead and we'll try our best to speak
[51:41] about it as I said if we if I don't have
[51:44] any
[51:45] problems you ask me brother Dale how
[51:48] does an automobile engine work I don't
[51:51] have a bit of problem telling you I
[51:52] don't
[51:54] know right right I got a lot of
[51:57] confidence in them that do know Richard
[51:59] took one apart up at the building one
[52:01] time and he was just throwing Parts over
[52:03] what
[52:04] you you never get this thing back
[52:07] together well you know what he got it
[52:09] back together it run right but I
[52:11] wouldn't dare do it cuz I'd have had to
[52:13] wrot down boat one goes in boat hole two
[52:16] goes and that's the only way I could
[52:18] ever got it done okay but see I want to
[52:21] speak about the godhead so write down
[52:23] your questions and answers and and like
[52:25] I'm saying I don't have all the answers
[52:27] and I have no problem saying right are
[52:30] there Aon back
[52:32] there he called me up years ago
[52:37] and he asked me a
[52:39] question and he was
[52:42] shocked because he was thought that he
[52:45] had been told that this great
[52:47] intellectual giant I reckon he thought
[52:49] was down in Georgia that knew everything
[52:51] and he asked me a question and I said I
[52:53] don't
[52:54] know and that was a shock to
[52:57] him well you know what I didn't
[52:59] know I could have spent hours trying to
[53:02] convinc him I thought I knew it right an
[53:06] intellectual speech but I didn't know
[53:08] what he asked me so I no problem I said
[53:10] don't know well see I don't have any
[53:12] problem saying I don't know so you ask
[53:14] me a question I don't have any problem
[53:16] saying all right we'll listen to what
[53:17] you got to say about it okay so we're
[53:20] going to do that on the watch not
[53:21] service but now
[53:24] listen
[53:27] when Jesus came
[53:29] here he didn't come as a flesh
[53:33] man is not necessarily him standing
[53:36] there in totally bodily form that's what
[53:40] we want to think about you know Jesus
[53:43] and brother brandom said on page 13
[53:44] Church AG book that the Book of
[53:46] Revelation is the only book in the Bible
[53:48] where as Jesus personally appearing to
[53:50] ascribe to write it's not necessarily
[53:53] there that he's coming in a
[53:56] body you know can be I'm not no problem
[54:00] if that's what you believe I don't have
[54:01] no problem I just tell you what I think
[54:05] but he's coming there to reveal to that
[54:09] angel that was to deliver the message to
[54:13] John about
[54:16] himself you say
[54:19] well I thought y'all believe that Jesus
[54:22] was
[54:23] God I do
[54:26] amen see God I preached this message
[54:29] back there a few weeks ago whenever I
[54:31] preached back under October uh I
[54:35] preached the message about God limiting
[54:38] himself you remember
[54:41] that now how is it that God can't see
[54:44] our sins
[54:47] right why did he not annihilate us right
[54:52] now because he doesn't see our sins why
[54:55] because there was a bumper blood even in
[54:57] the Old Testament of the blood of bulls
[54:59] and goats made a bumper blood you've
[55:01] heard it right and it covered
[55:04] mankind to keep us from being destroyed
[55:07] because the best we can do we've got
[55:10] problems
[55:11] right see so the bumper blood covered
[55:14] mankind until Jesus Christ came and then
[55:18] when he came it changed from a bumper
[55:21] blood of an animal that could only cover
[55:24] sin and not eradicated it changed to the
[55:27] blood of Jesus Christ all right which
[55:30] died the Bible says once for
[55:33] all all right and see then by him doing
[55:37] that see he paid the price and the
[55:40] bumper is covering us right see because
[55:43] if not why he would just annihilate us
[55:46] that's right so then he limited himself
[55:49] but he done it by what he said right he
[55:52] said I put the
[55:54] blood
[55:55] it wasn't what we done it wasn't what we
[55:58] thought up ourselves it's what he said
[56:01] he'd
[56:02] do now God is HonorBound to his word
[56:05] amen I like the way brother Brown said
[56:06] it one day and really when I first heard
[56:09] him I thought a lot about it but he said
[56:12] if you can find in the Bible a promise
[56:15] of God he said and you can call God on
[56:17] the scene and said if he don't do
[56:20] it amen he said you can call him a liar
[56:24] right
[56:25] right you see a man make that statement
[56:29] that's how much confidence he had in
[56:30] what God said that's right right right
[56:34] cuz if this is if this is not the word
[56:36] of God I know the story behind all of it
[56:39] don't worry about it I know who they say
[56:41] wrote a lot of this in
[56:43] here but I've seen it Vindicated myself
[56:46] and don't worry about it amen I know
[56:50] what they say that the writers of this
[56:51] and the writers of that and who you knew
[56:53] was that well you know you like they say
[56:55] about Moses how could Moses write of his
[56:57] own death before he died in Deuteronomy
[57:00] well if you'll explain how he wrote in
[57:01] Genesis 1 what happened to Genesis I
[57:03] don't think you got any problem about
[57:04] him writing about his own
[57:06] death cuz see that's what we get tied up
[57:09] with we we try to make you know great
[57:11] contradictions but they're not there
[57:14] amen he said well this is this that but
[57:16] it's it's simple terminologies you just
[57:18] sit down and reason it out a little bit
[57:20] you'll find out that it's not I believe
[57:22] it's the word of God delivered unto you
[57:24] and I that's right it was delivered by
[57:27] mankind that's what we're going to get
[57:30] into see if you believe the Bible is
[57:34] just what man
[57:36] said yes sir that's right you got a
[57:40] problem I don't believe it that way I
[57:43] believe it's what God delivered unto us
[57:46] that way
[57:47] then I can depend upon amen but see you
[57:51] don't realize what people do and and the
[57:54] depend dependence I said now I'm in the
[57:56] middle of the road see all right the
[57:59] dependence people has upon believing the
[58:02] Bible is that we must
[58:05] believe because God said that's what he
[58:08] would do Malachi 4 he said he would send
[58:11] us Elijah the prophet right to turn the
[58:14] hearts of the children
[58:15] back he said he'd do it right
[58:19] now if we don't believe brother of ram
[58:22] was that one that he said would come we
[58:24] better find
[58:26] somebody that's sensible that's not a
[58:30] don't you don't need to me bang your the
[58:31] head you see that that's sensible amen
[58:34] but if we believe that that was the one
[58:36] God used then he can't be contrary to
[58:40] anything else is in
[58:42] here that's
[58:45] sensible he wouldn't be a prophet if
[58:47] he's coner to anything
[58:48] else now a lot of things that I used to
[58:52] read I thought he was contrary to it
[58:54] when I first heard him right how about
[58:56] you amen but after beginning to read it
[58:59] a little while I found out as only way
[59:01] it could be
[59:03] said see God sent his
[59:06] word now he used the
[59:09] writers I know I ain't going to get
[59:11] nowhere so keep these papers till
[59:14] Wednesday all right okay I ain't going
[59:16] to get for just a little bit but
[59:19] see God
[59:22] used the apostles to write right right
[59:26] Matthew Mark Luke and John right seeing
[59:29] Luke and who Luke and Mark were not even
[59:32] original all right but they were the
[59:35] ones chosen Amen to write the word of
[59:37] God right okay now then he used Paul
[59:43] Peter James John
[59:46] Jude Titus right if I miss any of them
[59:50] in the writings of the New Testament
[59:51] Parts you put them in he used them to
[59:55] bring to us the understanding of
[59:59] almighty God amen amen and they wrote as
[1:00:02] that was revealed unto them right see as
[1:00:05] I said Luke and Mark were not original
[1:00:08] disciples they were not there with the
[1:00:10] Lord Jesus but I love to read the book
[1:00:12] of Luke you know because Luke says the
[1:00:16] only one that's got it Luke says right
[1:00:18] in the beginning he says having perfect
[1:00:22] understanding now you just think about
[1:00:24] he wouldn't D to see all the Lord Jesus
[1:00:26] done but he sat down and he listened to
[1:00:28] the John and them tell about
[1:00:31] it he listened to the others tell about
[1:00:34] it and the Holy Spirit says right that
[1:00:38] down when he finishes up you take the
[1:00:41] Book of Luke it's wonderful writings of
[1:00:44] a man amen sir but now
[1:00:47] listen if that's all you have is the
[1:00:50] writings of what you think is a man come
[1:00:52] on they were just like any other cult
[1:00:55] right that's right right we're just like
[1:00:58] any other cult any other group of people
[1:01:00] uh you
[1:01:02] know we're like
[1:01:04] any uh Buddha Hindu whatever
[1:01:08] right we're no different if that's all
[1:01:11] we believe
[1:01:12] right because even they believe that
[1:01:15] their books are inspired yes right the
[1:01:20] Islamic the the different ones you
[1:01:22] believe the books are inspired your
[1:01:23] Quran your
[1:01:25] they believe their books are inspired
[1:01:26] and handed down of
[1:01:28] God see if you don't believe that I
[1:01:31] wouldn't even be one of them that's
[1:01:33] right that's right that's just the way I
[1:01:34] am I'm just honest right see but see I
[1:01:37] believe the Bible is the word of God
[1:01:40] Amen now I say it this way for your
[1:01:43] benefit not mine if there is a God
[1:01:46] whatever you want to call
[1:01:48] him
[1:01:50] yeh U whatever you want to make it
[1:01:57] if that God cannot keep his word
[1:01:59] straight right come on then I don't want
[1:02:02] to serve him because I'm smarter than he
[1:02:06] is if I can prove that he's wrong that's
[1:02:09] right that's as tough as I make it
[1:02:13] right I mean that's just what that's
[1:02:15] just the way I believe it good see then
[1:02:18] I make the statement if God can't keep
[1:02:21] his word
[1:02:22] straight who do we serve
[1:02:26] amen are we a glorified monkey that fell
[1:02:29] off of an evolution tree
[1:02:31] sir you
[1:02:33] know well I just soon believe that is to
[1:02:36] to believe that God can't keep his word
[1:02:39] straight now that's my emphasis that's
[1:02:41] my statement that's where I depend upon
[1:02:44] the word of God
[1:02:46] Amen all right but see what I've tried
[1:02:49] to get you to see is it said the
[1:02:51] Revelation that God give to Jesus
[1:02:56] mhm now you'll be surprised when we get
[1:02:58] on to the watch notot service because
[1:03:01] basically what your thoughts are right
[1:03:02] there that and that's the reason I said
[1:03:06] it was not necessarily a flesh man that
[1:03:08] come to
[1:03:09] John
[1:03:12] right it was not necessarily a 16
[1:03:16] element man that walked up to John
[1:03:19] that's right amen it was Jesus Christ
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:27] so you when I say Jesus most everybody
[1:03:29] thinks of the flesh that's right right
[1:03:31] that's why I asked the question one time
[1:03:33] when when I say son of God what do you
[1:03:35] think of and everybody here said 2,000
[1:03:38] years
[1:03:38] ago I said my Lord even the theologians
[1:03:41] knew that the Son of God was the Loos
[1:03:43] that went out of God in the beginning
[1:03:45] the Creator
[1:03:47] amen but see that's where we get tied up
[1:03:50] into
[1:03:52] flesh and we say say that Jesus didn't
[1:03:57] understand his part in the
[1:04:00] Kingdom until he comes to John on
[1:04:02] patment cuz we say the flesh couldn't
[1:04:05] understand right well I didn't know the
[1:04:08] flesh understood
[1:04:11] anything I thought the flesh could only
[1:04:13] work by the spirit and the
[1:04:16] soul I thought the flesh was
[1:04:20] useless if not come up here I'll tap you
[1:04:22] in the head knock out all your brain
[1:04:24] operations and we'll see what you
[1:04:29] see see the body the the the flesh is
[1:04:33] dead amen right without something to
[1:04:36] motivate it
[1:04:38] right doctor sitting back here he's he's
[1:04:41] in the other reals of it but he studied
[1:04:43] enough of that to know
[1:04:45] you that body is
[1:04:49] usess without something to make it
[1:04:52] motivated you don't lust with your body
[1:04:56] right you portray lust with your
[1:04:59] body you have to lust with your
[1:05:02] spiritual
[1:05:04] realm all right so don't just say that
[1:05:07] when Jesus was here well it's just CA
[1:05:10] he's in
[1:05:11] flesh it wasn't
[1:05:14] there the bumper blood of G of God was
[1:05:18] put here and there was nobody in flesh
[1:05:22] right right come on you understand what
[1:05:26] I mean by
[1:05:27] that you say it was just the flesh that
[1:05:29] kept him from
[1:05:32] understanding well what about the bumper
[1:05:34] blood who put it
[1:05:37] there that would cover us and are the
[1:05:39] people of the Old
[1:05:41] Testament see we get our our minds
[1:05:44] locked on to things and not realizing we
[1:05:46] turn out to be a Oneness more than we
[1:05:48] are the true understanding of God amen
[1:05:51] amen that's right you can never get away
[1:05:54] away from the fact of Father Son and
[1:05:55] Holy Ghost and be able to believe one
[1:05:58] true and living God right amen cuz if
[1:06:00] you narrow it down do you just got Jesus
[1:06:02] your Oneness and the Oneness is the just
[1:06:05] as far off the scale as the Trinity is
[1:06:07] on the other end of the scale
[1:06:11] amen see it has to be a revelation
[1:06:15] amen and to see this is the way God done
[1:06:19] it now that's my point the way God done
[1:06:22] it and what he said limited him to where
[1:06:26] that he you know I don't have no
[1:06:29] education forgive me go ahead you say
[1:06:31] limit God oh boy you're something no you
[1:06:35] tell me what it
[1:06:37] is I'm up for opinions and ideas of
[1:06:40] expression that's the best I can do but
[1:06:43] when God
[1:06:45] said he said his word was using Wy he
[1:06:48] said Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:06:52] hated before nether one of them was
[1:06:56] born now that's Bible right y well now
[1:07:00] that made him this now that's your idea
[1:07:03] right now you're trying to figure out
[1:07:05] how he done it don't worry about it just
[1:07:08] believe it I don't know how he saved any
[1:07:10] of you and I am is anybody in here that
[1:07:13] was good enough to be
[1:07:15] saved oh
[1:07:17] boy
[1:07:20] no that's right it doesn't work that way
[1:07:25] amen he saved us because we accepted
[1:07:29] it we believed it
[1:07:32] amen but get my
[1:07:35] point the Revelation that God give to
[1:07:38] Jesus to give to
[1:07:40] John now when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:07:43] see you go right back well it's a
[1:07:45] flesh now when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:07:47] they ask him when he's coming he said I
[1:07:49] don't know
[1:07:52] right well that just CA the
[1:07:58] flesh I mean is that all you got that's
[1:08:01] that's an answer to hold you for a while
[1:08:04] right right that's something to hold you
[1:08:06] for a
[1:08:08] while but can you see that because he
[1:08:12] condescended to earth oh my I'm on watch
[1:08:15] that service I got to get off that but
[1:08:18] get the point I get on because he
[1:08:21] condescended
[1:08:22] down he he put these
[1:08:27] limits and he told people what to do you
[1:08:30] offer that blood I'll take care of the
[1:08:32] rest of
[1:08:34] it well you know what they done in the
[1:08:36] Old Testament they took a lamb up and
[1:08:39] offered him for their sins and went
[1:08:41] right back and done the same thing again
[1:08:44] amen right amen we better not do it in
[1:08:47] Jesus Christ amen but get the
[1:08:52] point
[1:08:55] God had
[1:08:57] something that he didn't make known to
[1:09:00] mankind and Jesus said I don't know when
[1:09:02] I'm coming said only the Father Knows
[1:09:05] well I boy you're a
[1:09:07] trinitarian then we try to conceive the
[1:09:10] idea that God was inside of that
[1:09:15] flesh and that made him to word that he
[1:09:18] wouldn't know all
[1:09:21] things not only made him to where he
[1:09:23] couldn't display all things cuz it only
[1:09:26] made him like I said in the other day to
[1:09:27] the basis that he couldn't be all over
[1:09:29] the
[1:09:31] world how come at times he knew
[1:09:35] everything and other times he didn't
[1:09:37] know everything
[1:09:40] right because God limited himself
[1:09:46] amen I've often him said I was going to
[1:09:48] preach on the god with amnesia you know
[1:09:50] what amnesia is you forget things right
[1:09:53] you know God has to forget our sins
[1:09:55] amen you tell me how he does
[1:09:58] it come on explain how God forgets our
[1:10:01] sins that's
[1:10:03] right when he's omnicient omnip
[1:10:06] omnipresent and he knows everything
[1:10:09] right how does he not know what we
[1:10:13] do that's right cuz he done it himself
[1:10:16] that way amen that's right even you
[1:10:20] totem pole would know what you done cuz
[1:10:21] the totem pole be looking at you amen
[1:10:24] how much greater Is
[1:10:27] God but you
[1:10:29] see there was something that was not
[1:10:32] made known while he was here right amen
[1:10:35] now I asked you a simple question not to
[1:10:37] trap you or be smart a simple
[1:10:40] question how many of you have the new
[1:10:43] birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:46] you don't have to raise your hand I'm
[1:10:47] just asking you well do you know
[1:10:49] everything
[1:10:50] time then you'll say no it's because of
[1:10:53] this flesh
[1:10:59] I wouldn't use that too much that's
[1:11:01] right you cuz if you ain't careful
[1:11:03] you'll blame God for what you do in the
[1:11:06] flesh you know my brother subed this
[1:11:09] preacher 12 years in college he said God
[1:11:12] made me this way he made me a sinner he
[1:11:15] can't judge me for being a sinner oh my
[1:11:17] I said brother you didn't God didn't
[1:11:18] make you a sinner you made yourself
[1:11:21] right you volunteered it wouldn't what
[1:11:23] he done right every baby's born into the
[1:11:26] world
[1:11:27] perfect you make your own self a sinner
[1:11:30] right
[1:11:31] amen but it's the Revelation that God
[1:11:34] give to Jesus okay I gave you the ones
[1:11:35] there that you can look
[1:11:37] at on page one of your
[1:11:40] notes and then we'll just go a while and
[1:11:42] we'll quit cuz this I've done give it to
[1:11:45] you but it's 12 13 and 14 of the church
[1:11:48] age book where the prophet of God and I
[1:11:51] wish you would read the church ages
[1:11:53] either from the church age book or the
[1:11:55] church Age series and if you don't have
[1:11:57] the books of the series you can go on
[1:11:59] the internet and pull them up and read
[1:12:01] them but
[1:12:02] listen listen what the prophet of God
[1:12:05] had to say I know I've read these before
[1:12:07] but I've got to put these in here
[1:12:09] because people out there don't know what
[1:12:11] we've already heard so you know they
[1:12:14] have to be you know I'm talking about
[1:12:15] the internet system all right brother
[1:12:18] Brown starts off and he said the Scribe
[1:12:20] not author of this book is St John the
[1:12:23] Divine
[1:12:24] historians agree that he lived the last
[1:12:26] part of his life in Ephesus though at
[1:12:29] the time of the writing of this book he
[1:12:32] was on the aisle of Patman he was put
[1:12:34] there as I said while too because he was
[1:12:36] trying to put the get the the the
[1:12:38] writings you know to where people could
[1:12:40] read them they outlawed him they boiled
[1:12:42] him in oil for 24 hours and couldn't get
[1:12:44] the Holy Ghost out of him so they
[1:12:45] decided we'll send him to
[1:12:47] alcatra now see we would understand
[1:12:50] alcatra better than we'd understand
[1:12:52] patmas but that's what it was it wasn't
[1:12:54] nothing but a Rock Island that was
[1:12:56] filled with snakes and and garbage and
[1:12:59] things and you know and they throw their
[1:13:00] bad prisoners out there and that's where
[1:13:03] John was sent because they couldn't do
[1:13:04] nothing with him what are you going to
[1:13:05] do with a man you can't boil it out of
[1:13:07] him but
[1:13:10] watch no at the time of the writing of
[1:13:13] this book he was on the aisle of patas
[1:13:14] it is not the life story of John but is
[1:13:17] a revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:13:19] future Church
[1:13:22] ages
[1:13:24] in verse three it is called a prophecy
[1:13:27] and that is actually what it
[1:13:30] is so we're going on reading now this
[1:13:34] book is usually termed the revelation of
[1:13:36] St John but that is not correct it is
[1:13:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ given to
[1:13:41] John for Christians of all
[1:13:43] ages it is the only book in the entire
[1:13:46] Bible that is written by Jesus himself
[1:13:49] through personally appearing to a scribe
[1:13:55] amen now so it's the Revelation that God
[1:13:58] give to Jesus but how did he do it he
[1:14:02] gave it to an angel to give to John we
[1:14:04] went over that the other night you read
[1:14:06] Revelation one I mean Revelation 1 verse
[1:14:09] 1 23 and you're dealing with what the
[1:14:12] angel says you read uh a little I'll
[1:14:15] hold that we'll get further but look now
[1:14:18] the Greek word for Revelation I'm going
[1:14:20] over page 13 number two not number two
[1:14:23] in your notes number one with the line
[1:14:24] all the way down means this is a
[1:14:25] continual reading okay that just that's
[1:14:28] reason I put that line down with the one
[1:14:29] or whatever the number it means this is
[1:14:31] continual reading it's not a gaping the
[1:14:34] Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse
[1:14:36] which means unveiling this unveiling is
[1:14:39] perfectly described in the example of a
[1:14:41] sculpture unveiling his work of Statuary
[1:14:44] exposing to the own looker it is
[1:14:47] uncovering revealing what was previously
[1:14:49] hidden now the uncovering is not only
[1:14:52] the revelation listen to this one the
[1:14:55] uncovering is not only the revelation of
[1:14:58] the person of
[1:15:01] Christ but it is the revelation of his
[1:15:03] future work in the oncoming seven Church
[1:15:07] ages now that bears in mind to we hold
[1:15:10] that all right contined
[1:15:12] reading and I said that this book of
[1:15:14] Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and
[1:15:16] what he is doing in the church ages for
[1:15:18] those Seven Ages it is a revelation
[1:15:21] because the disciples themselves didn't
[1:15:23] know these previously recorded truths
[1:15:25] you know about the revelations or
[1:15:27] anything it had not been previously
[1:15:29] revealed to them you remember that they
[1:15:32] came to Jesus in the book of Acts and
[1:15:34] asked him are you at this time going to
[1:15:36] restore the kingdom to Israel and he
[1:15:38] said it is not for you to know the times
[1:15:40] or the seasons these men were still
[1:15:43] thinking of Jesus having an Earthly
[1:15:45] Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom
[1:15:48] that he was going to build even he could
[1:15:51] not tell them about his place in
[1:15:54] it listen for the father had not
[1:15:57] revealed it unto him but now after his
[1:16:01] death and resurrection and at this
[1:16:03] particular time in his mediatorial
[1:16:06] ministry he's able to set forth here in
[1:16:08] this revelation of himself to John what
[1:16:10] his glory and presence in the church
[1:16:13] would mean and do right all right now
[1:16:18] Jesus didn't understand because I said
[1:16:22] he said I don't know when I'm com
[1:16:25] you know why he didn't understand it
[1:16:26] because he didn't live
[1:16:28] it right now I preached to you a few
[1:16:30] weeks ago and showed you where brother
[1:16:32] Bram said and gave you the quotes that
[1:16:35] we do what Jesus couldn't
[1:16:38] do wait minut he was God he do we do
[1:16:42] what Jesus couldn't do Jesus couldn't
[1:16:44] preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost because he' not been crucified
[1:16:48] that's what the scripture said what the
[1:16:50] prophet said that's right so we preach
[1:16:53] on the day of Pentecost Peter preached
[1:16:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people
[1:16:58] received it right now while Jesus was
[1:17:00] here no one was given eternal life right
[1:17:04] come on come on show me in the Bible
[1:17:06] amen that's right amen nobody got
[1:17:08] eternal life the closest man that was to
[1:17:11] it was John on one end of it but
[1:17:14] remember John was not in the Kingdom cuz
[1:17:16] the Bible say John receiv received the
[1:17:19] Holy Ghost in his mother's womb but the
[1:17:20] Bible said the least in the kingdom is
[1:17:22] greater than John but John wasn't in the
[1:17:25] Kingdom right the new birth never come
[1:17:27] until the day of Pentecost right that's
[1:17:30] right I know what we bapti just believe
[1:17:32] so I talk with a brother about that oh
[1:17:34] we believed all them deciples that dud
[1:17:36] believe they born again no they wasn't
[1:17:39] you couldn't be born again without the
[1:17:40] death of the testator what Paul says in
[1:17:43] Romans right Jesus Christ had not died
[1:17:46] the scripture said the Holy Ghost had
[1:17:47] not been given right right all right you
[1:17:51] go on the other end of the scale and say
[1:17:52] what about the thief on the cross
[1:17:54] remember he never got a year he had to
[1:17:55] go with Jesus that's right right right
[1:17:58] that's right cuz he said this day you'll
[1:18:00] be with me in
[1:18:01] Paradise he never gave him eternal
[1:18:04] life he said well see that's why people
[1:18:07] don't understand they as I said they go
[1:18:09] this Rod or this or this way see a big
[1:18:12] portion of people of this message don't
[1:18:14] even believe that come on that's right
[1:18:16] they think that that you had eternal
[1:18:17] life in the Old Testament and they had
[1:18:19] eternal life in the stop where'd they
[1:18:20] get it from right
[1:18:24] why did Jesus have to die to had eternal
[1:18:26] life come
[1:18:28] on he had to die to release that life
[1:18:31] amen amen it was vital up in him right
[1:18:35] because his word said it was well all he
[1:18:38] had to do just go out and give it see
[1:18:39] that's what you think cuz you're a
[1:18:43] Catholic you think you can give it
[1:18:45] because it belong to your church oh my
[1:18:47] brown much you think you give eternal
[1:18:50] life
[1:18:50] because they said believe what you say
[1:18:54] oh no I don't depend upon what you say
[1:18:56] or I say I depend upon what the word of
[1:18:59] God says right amen that's why I stay
[1:19:02] with that prophet's message that's
[1:19:05] right but now
[1:19:08] listen you said but God you mean you
[1:19:10] believe he's God and he didn't know all
[1:19:12] things you believe you're born again do
[1:19:14] you know all
[1:19:15] things I'm sorry I'm I know I become
[1:19:18] your enemy because I told you the truth
[1:19:21] that's what Paul said didn't he
[1:19:25] brother Dale brother Sho said this I
[1:19:27] don't care what brother sh so
[1:19:30] says I'm not going to argue with nobody
[1:19:32] about it I'm just going to tell you what
[1:19:34] I believe
[1:19:36] right but then you better not ask me
[1:19:38] about so and so what he believes I might
[1:19:40] tell you why he believes
[1:19:44] that amen cuz I ain't played around all
[1:19:48] these
[1:19:49] years see God
[1:19:53] came down in human flesh amen you
[1:19:58] agree sir even your River Jordan people
[1:20:01] would have to agree those that believe
[1:20:02] that Jesus wouldn't go out to the River
[1:20:04] Jordan those that teach that they would
[1:20:05] have to agree to these next statements
[1:20:07] Jesus as a baby couldn't die with your
[1:20:10] sins Jesus at 12 years old even though
[1:20:13] he could stand there and confound the
[1:20:14] scholars he couldn't die for your sins
[1:20:17] he couldn't die for your sins until he
[1:20:18] become of age cu the Bible said it
[1:20:23] the high
[1:20:24] priest had to be becoming 30 before he
[1:20:28] could enter the ministry
[1:20:32] amen right like I said you take Jesus we
[1:20:35] can prove he's born in ail you can prove
[1:20:37] it born in April he would proven he was
[1:20:39] crucified in April now have him
[1:20:41] preaching 3 and 1/2 years and get it in
[1:20:45] there you done goofed
[1:20:47] up but if you let Jesus in the ministry
[1:20:50] at 29 and a half
[1:20:53] that's why that high priest had to be
[1:20:55] becoming
[1:20:56] 30 you're 29 and a half he can enter the
[1:20:59] ministry and go on Jesus couldn't do it
[1:21:02] until he entered the ministry that's
[1:21:04] right he entered the ministry on the
[1:21:07] River Jordan
[1:21:08] right not that he wasn't God all the
[1:21:11] time no he was amen but it's because
[1:21:14] what he said he's going to do amen what
[1:21:17] about God could walk among man and not
[1:21:19] destroy man yes you explain
[1:21:24] that you explain how that Jesus could be
[1:21:27] God even if you believe he's the second
[1:21:29] person of the
[1:21:31] Trinity come on how could he be here and
[1:21:34] not destroy us come on CU he kept his
[1:21:38] word they brought a little woman to him
[1:21:41] right one day that's right and said your
[1:21:45] word says kill her right now what was he
[1:21:49] going to do like I heard somebody the
[1:21:51] other day said was a good point was it
[1:21:52] you or somebody said you know that they
[1:21:55] bring the man that's now that's against
[1:21:57] the law that's
[1:21:59] right that was against the law the
[1:22:01] Pharisees broke the law they're supposed
[1:22:02] to bring the man and the woman and throw
[1:22:03] them down then he going to kill both of
[1:22:05] them that was against the law they broke
[1:22:07] their own law by not doing it right and
[1:22:09] what Jesus
[1:22:10] do he couldn't turn around I don't
[1:22:13] believe I've seen you do nothing like
[1:22:14] that no he know that's telling the truth
[1:22:18] about her yes sir but you know what he
[1:22:21] done he got got rid of their Witnesses
[1:22:24] right
[1:22:26] right he got rid of the witnesses
[1:22:29] without a witness the Bible said in the
[1:22:31] mouth of two or three
[1:22:34] Witnesses if there have been two or
[1:22:36] three line that have said she done it
[1:22:38] he' said killer course my word says it
[1:22:40] that's right he didn't break his word he
[1:22:42] just got rid of the
[1:22:44] witnesses amen thank you Lord right he
[1:22:48] turned around finally to said where's
[1:22:50] your Witnesses I don't have any
[1:22:53] he said neither do I condemn
[1:22:57] thee cuz he was still under the bumper
[1:22:59] blood of the Old Testament
[1:23:02] itself see I tell people you know even
[1:23:06] and my nephew is a Baptist preacher he
[1:23:08] knows that you tell most people say turn
[1:23:10] to the first book of the New Testament
[1:23:11] turn to Matthew automatically that's not
[1:23:13] the first book of the New Testament the
[1:23:15] first book of the New Testament is the
[1:23:17] book of Acts CU in Matthew Mark and Luke
[1:23:20] and John Jesus was still under the law
[1:23:22] him self he come under the law to redeem
[1:23:25] them when it went under the law that's
[1:23:26] why he tell him when he healed one now
[1:23:28] you go offer that's right the offering
[1:23:31] of Moses exactly cuz he was still under
[1:23:34] the law itself yes sir he was the end of
[1:23:37] the law Calvary right amen
[1:23:41] amen yes sir did you say well brother
[1:23:45] you mean God limits
[1:23:48] himself by his
[1:23:50] word by his word word
[1:23:55] amen if he tells you something in the
[1:23:57] word don't you worry about it amen he'll
[1:23:59] keep his
[1:24:03] word just make sure you know what he's
[1:24:05] saiding in his word that's right but you
[1:24:09] see Jesus didn't know his
[1:24:13] part because that had not been made
[1:24:16] known to
[1:24:18] him see that's where it goes in know
[1:24:21] here's where we go I keep coming around
[1:24:23] and around all but how could he be God
[1:24:25] not
[1:24:27] know because he said he would do it that
[1:24:30] way thank God that he said he would do
[1:24:33] it your sins and your iniquities will I
[1:24:37] remember no more that what he said did
[1:24:39] he even speak to David and David in the
[1:24:42] psalm in the spirit the scripture said
[1:24:44] stand up and say blessed is a man to
[1:24:46] whom God will not impute sin amen
[1:24:50] amen amen
[1:24:55] are we still in the Bible yes
[1:24:58] amen see God limited himself
[1:25:01] then not just because he stepped in
[1:25:04] flesh but because his
[1:25:06] word you explain one thing to me and I
[1:25:09] don't have to explain everything else
[1:25:11] you explain to me how that
[1:25:13] God killed those animals in Genesis one
[1:25:16] or two amen Genesis 2 right God killed
[1:25:21] those animals right when you tell me

[1:25:25] spirit he's just floating around he's
[1:25:28] just a spirit bless well who killed them
[1:25:32] animals that's

[1:25:38] on almighty God killed them animals and
[1:25:41] took the skins and put them on out of KN
[1:25:45] now you tell me anything
[1:25:48] else well how you done he used an angel
[1:25:51] to do that brother Dale he just well I

[1:26:25] doing it then we'll just cover another
[1:26:26] point or two and go

[1:26:40] got this written down it'll help on wed
[1:26:43] on the watch Night Service it will help
[1:26:45] you better to understand how that God
[1:26:47] done things and how that that limits
[1:26:50] himself to what he he doneen but now I
[1:26:55] I'm listen folks now if You' ever
[1:26:57] believed brother Dale would you please
[1:27:00] listen all
[1:27:02] right
[1:27:04] now see they make a lot about brother
[1:27:08] Brandon and there's nobody here that
[1:27:11] honors him no more than I
[1:27:13] do but I don't believe he was God that's
[1:27:16] right that's right A lot of people the
[1:27:18] Mage believe he was you'd be surprised
[1:27:21] about the doctrine that go around the
[1:27:23] message and they don't realize the end
[1:27:26] of that Doctrine and what it means and
[1:27:29] you may believe it that's up to you I'm
[1:27:30] I'm just
[1:27:32] me but you see the doctrine of the uh
[1:27:36] the old Doctrine it was called tent
[1:27:38] Visions our return Ministries that
[1:27:40] brother brandham has got to come back
[1:27:42] and do this that and the
[1:27:45] other if you'll finally run those things
[1:27:47] out you'll find out that they actually
[1:27:50] teach that uh brother random will be our
[1:27:53] God in the Millennium yes
[1:27:57] sir see it's exactly what Satan wants
[1:27:59] you to believe that's right amen Satan
[1:28:04] wants you to believe that he's
[1:28:07] God now there's a lot of people that
[1:28:09] believe that brother randam was the one
[1:28:12] that come to John on
[1:28:15] patas we'll get back to that
[1:28:20] Wednesday and they believe it because
[1:28:22] they use the scripture that he'll do
[1:28:25] nothing except reveal itself to the
[1:28:26] prophets and I'm not I'm not picking on
[1:28:29] nobody this message was in planning many
[1:28:32] many months ago okay so then you won't
[1:28:34] think that I was just saying something
[1:28:36] because what the brother preached the
[1:28:37] other weekend right what that man preach
[1:28:40] is his business what he believes is his
[1:28:42] business I don't have anything to do
[1:28:43] with it I just don't believe that
[1:28:46] brother brandham was the one that come
[1:28:47] to John on P I believe you're putting
[1:28:50] too much emphasis amen upon things
[1:28:53] others believe that John was translated
[1:28:56] over to see our day where brother brand
[1:28:58] was here preaching the word that sounds
[1:29:00] a little better but I still don't clear
[1:29:02] it up to me I just don't see it so I
[1:29:05] intend to bring a a complete series on
[1:29:07] this and to show you what I believe and
[1:29:10] why I believe it but what what others
[1:29:13] believe is their business I'm not
[1:29:14] against anybody I love everybody I'm not
[1:29:16] I'm not against anybody no no problems
[1:29:20] but if you believe that brother brandom
[1:29:22] come to John on patmas what are you
[1:29:24] making the
[1:29:25] emphasis and I thoroughly listen I
[1:29:27] thoroughly enjoy what the brother had to
[1:29:29] say about we don't worship brother
[1:29:31] brandom we don't do those things I'm I'm
[1:29:33] right in there 100% I listen Okay but I
[1:29:37] just don't
[1:29:38] believe that brother brandham come to
[1:29:40] John on
[1:29:41] Patman right now I believe the emphasis
[1:29:44] should be placed
[1:29:45] upon not who come to John on patmas
[1:29:50] right but who come to brother brandom
[1:29:54] here in this
[1:29:55] life that's right now that's my emphasis
[1:29:59] that's right we better put the emphasis
[1:30:01] now go ahead and make these statements
[1:30:03] brother brandom in many many many
[1:30:05] emphasis before and after the seal would
[1:30:07] talk about a great one to come right and
[1:30:10] that's made a lot of doctrines around
[1:30:12] the message that brother so and so is a
[1:30:14] great one Lowry this one that the other
[1:30:17] there's a lot of people run forth with
[1:30:19] doctrines that you know that claim that
[1:30:21] they are the one that brother Bram spoke
[1:30:23] of I sat on the porch with a man and
[1:30:25] I've told you many times about it and he
[1:30:27] believed that he was the one to come the
[1:30:29] great one and I just looked him in the
[1:30:31] face and told him I said he weighed 475
[1:30:34] lb but I couldn't back off the word
[1:30:37] because how big he was but I just looked
[1:30:39] at him I said listen
[1:30:41] brother the great one to come is the
[1:30:43] Lord Jesus Christ right amen and you're
[1:30:46] not that one that was to come if you
[1:30:48] believe you are I'm going just tell you
[1:30:50] to your face you him because it's the
[1:30:54] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:55] amen it's not who come to John on patmas
[1:30:59] it's who come to brother Brown come on
[1:31:01] Amen that we better be concerned about
[1:31:04] that's right because you can't take the
[1:31:06] great one on over there as being a human
[1:31:10] flesh no that's right and see one thing
[1:31:13] that people needs to do and in case a
[1:31:15] brother hears this if I ever talk with
[1:31:17] him I'll tell him you need to get the
[1:31:19] right scripture if you're going to talk
[1:31:20] about anything
[1:31:22] because Revelations 19 is not the
[1:31:25] scripture brother Ram 's talking about
[1:31:27] the angel coming to John that's
[1:31:29] revelation 22 CU Revelation 19 is the
[1:31:32] spirit of Prophecy it tells you exactly
[1:31:33] who it is right but see I'm not against
[1:31:37] those
[1:31:38] people Heaven Help right I've had this
[1:31:41] discussion with a brother one time
[1:31:43] before about it and I said
[1:31:45] listen what would it help us if we knew
[1:31:47] brother randam was the one that come to
[1:31:50] John what would that help you would it
[1:31:52] change you yes sir would it change you
[1:31:55] if brother R was going to come back in a
[1:31:56] tent and put it up and preach across the
[1:31:59] country I've never told people what
[1:32:01] anything contrary to that I believe
[1:32:03] brother random can come back in the
[1:32:06] resurrection exactly and he breached for
[1:32:09] 30 40 days
[1:32:13] exactly but not looking for him not sit
[1:32:15] down waiting on him to raise and
[1:32:20] then and in life about
[1:32:23] Muhammad come on oh and the horse that
[1:32:26] they keep over there at least they
[1:32:28] changed the horse every 4 hours yes
[1:32:31] sir at least they believe it enough to
[1:32:33] keep the horse ready that's right the
[1:32:35] people that claim brother Brown to
[1:32:37] coming back with the airplane said it'
[1:32:39] take 2 years and he said it himself two
[1:32:41] years to make the airplane flyable so he
[1:32:43] said brother can't come back for two
[1:32:49] years you see we life at other
[1:32:54] people
[1:32:56] that's but I'm just telling
[1:32:59] you there was an angel that come to Joy
[1:33:03] right we'll get to that cuz there was an
[1:33:05] angel that come to John to give him the
[1:33:09] Revelation in Revelations
[1:33:13] one we better find out who that angel is
[1:33:15] y right and get him in the right way
[1:33:19] amen now I want to ask you one question
[1:33:21] because this a border on
[1:33:24] it you believe that brother random had

[1:35:00] right amen thank
[1:35:03] you but you
[1:35:04] see we don't believe that God is on the
[1:35:07] scene we just think it's an
[1:35:08] argumentative I have no argument with
[1:35:11] nobody that's right I love all these
[1:35:14] brothers I've had them to preach right
[1:35:16] here that believe things that I didn't
[1:35:17] believe
[1:35:19] amen but I love the Brothers right and
[1:35:23] they done
[1:35:26] good but open your ears to hear to see
[1:35:30] what he said

[1:35:45] that intentionally but I am 7 years
[1:35:49] old like my wife say says you can't
[1:35:51] remember nothing else but you can
[1:35:53] remember the message well okay thank God
[1:35:56] for
[1:35:57] that because that's what I let's stand
[1:36:00] together let's gool down and get ready
[1:36:02] they haven't let us know yet but let's
[1:36:03] sing a little bit brother dick uh tell
[1:36:06] them to Richard tell him to let us know
[1:36:08] when he's ready we'll sing a little bit
[1:36:10] until that time okay I hope you
[1:36:16] understand I believe in one true and
[1:36:18] living God Amen I believe Jes Jesus was
[1:36:21] that God Amen but our problem is is we
[1:36:25] we've come down and we tried to down him
[1:36:28] into that body without leaving
[1:36:31] God in the place that he
[1:36:35] was why
[1:36:37] would okay ain't not even here yet okay
[1:36:39] we could have preached another hour but
[1:36:42] we'll sing another
[1:36:43] hour but you
[1:36:47] see
[1:36:49] God is revealing himself to you amen
[1:36:52] just because you have the baptism of the
[1:36:54] Holy Ghost don't mean you know
[1:36:57] everything right that's
[1:36:59] right that's
[1:37:02] true but yet you're born again right
[1:37:05] amen but there's one thing for sure
[1:37:08] Jesus couldn't deny anything the father
[1:37:10] said and be God that's right you and I
[1:37:14] can't deny anything God
[1:37:16] says and believe that that's God in us
[1:37:20] amen that don't need
[1:37:24] interpreting that's why I just
[1:37:26] like when I was in the Baptist brother
[1:37:29] mod ask me because Baptist Doctrine is
[1:37:31] one
[1:37:33] God that's the Baptist Doctrine one
[1:37:36] God but it's what God in threee person
[1:37:39] Blessed
[1:37:41] Trinity see it's just as much Trinity as
[1:37:44] anything else well when brother Mo asked
[1:37:46] me he said the brother had introduced me
[1:37:48] to the message he said what do you
[1:37:49] believe about God I said he knew Baptist
[1:37:51] he's smart and you he said what do you
[1:37:54] believe I said one true and living God
[1:37:56] my brother was a strict trinitarian and
[1:37:58] even before I heard brother brand I'd
[1:38:00] argue with him all night long in
[1:38:01] funerals we'd set up with people you
[1:38:03] know we used to do that in the old days
[1:38:04] we set up all night with the bodies you
[1:38:06] know and I set up all night and argued
[1:38:08] with him over one
[1:38:11] God you
[1:38:13] see when brother Mo asked me that
[1:38:15] question he said what do you believe I
[1:38:16] said I believe in one true and living
[1:38:17] God he said explain it I said it's God
[1:38:20] and true person Blessed Trinity cuz
[1:38:22] that's the only way I could explain he
[1:38:24] said you're Trinity just like everybody
[1:38:25] else called a person is a personality
[1:38:27] personality is an individual individual
[1:38:29] to person he said you're a smart human
[1:38:32] being what do you believe I said I don't
[1:38:34] believe that
[1:38:36] anymore it didn't take no two weeks or
[1:38:39] two years for me to understand it I
[1:38:40] realized I had my hi nailed to the wall
[1:38:43] by the word of God
[1:38:45] Amen and I simply looked at him and said
[1:38:48] I don't believe that no more I don't
[1:38:50] believe in God in three persons no more
[1:38:53] but I believe in God in many many
[1:38:56] manifestations many forms that he's
[1:39:00] in and I believe right now he's in the
[1:39:03] form of the
[1:39:05] Bride of Jesus Christ upon this Earth
[1:39:09] living in you and me that's where a Wess
[1:39:12] can't do that cuz a Wess see the life's
[1:39:14] manifestation of God was Jesus that's
[1:39:16] why it's Oneness right they don't
[1:39:18] believe in one in in another form right
[1:39:21] see we go out of here God goes to the
[1:39:22] Jews that's another
[1:39:24] form we get it to why Throne judgment he
[1:39:27] sitting there and gives eternal life to

[1:39:30] God Amen we get into the future home

[1:56:00] oh I'm a new
[1:56:03] Cre what you
[1:56:07] are all things are passed away I'm born
[1:56:17] again that's what I
[1:56:21] I'm a new
[1:56:24] creation I'm a brand new man who are
[1:56:27] we we
[1:56:32] are
[1:56:34] father we are
[1:56:40] going we are
[1:56:45] people
[1:56:47] King we are
[1:56:51] we
[1:56:54] are am then they're still not here so if
[1:56:57] you want to be
[1:56:59] seated and we won't change things around
[1:57:02] much but if you want to be seated just
[1:57:05] remember the
[1:57:06] things and just pray that the Lord would
[1:57:09] bless you and give you understanding I
[1:57:12] know that the way that I
[1:57:15] speak requires for God to reveal it I
[1:57:18] know that
[1:57:20] but I I can't help it I was made that
[1:57:22] way and you know I I I do the best I can
[1:57:27] to try to put it into simple language to
[1:57:30] try to to uh help people right but I
[1:57:34] realize too that uh it takes God to
[1:57:38] reveal yes it's not me and you that can
[1:57:41] reveal or whatever we can do it's not
[1:57:43] that way it takes God to
[1:57:46] reveal but see then when I say things
[1:57:48] take it and
[1:57:49] and go home and consider
[1:57:51] it and then ask God to speak to you yes
[1:57:55] and hey I realize that sometimes that I
[1:57:58] preached things for 10 15 years
[1:58:01] before it's really
[1:58:03] is is really made known a lot of
[1:58:07] times and you
[1:58:09] know it it takes a lot of background to
[1:58:13] understand sometimes when someone is
[1:58:15] trying to bring something that you're
[1:58:17] not used to hearing you know because it
[1:58:19] come out with a new thing and that's
[1:58:21] what they think it is but uh I'm not
[1:58:23] talking about something new I'm talking
[1:58:26] about the oldest thing that has ever
[1:58:28] been talking about God revealing himself
[1:58:32] to
[1:58:34] mankind you know that's what he wanted
[1:58:36] to
[1:58:38] do no matter what you would think of who
[1:58:40] your God is your God wants to reveal
[1:58:43] himself to
[1:58:47] you I mean it wouldn't matter what I was
[1:58:50] religious belief I was having today I
[1:58:52] would still want to think that my God
[1:58:54] wants to speak to
[1:58:56] me cuz why would the
[1:59:00] creators I mean we surely like we
[1:59:02] talking about last night surely we don't
[1:59:03] want to think that we just rolled around
[1:59:06] here and fell off of some log you know
[1:59:07] and this poliwog went from that poliwog
[1:59:10] to that poliwog to this poliwog and we
[1:59:12] wound up being human beings well why
[1:59:15] haven't we evolved any
[1:59:16] further now the only thing that I ever
[1:59:19] seen us evolve to is they say we come
[1:59:22] down from Monkey well I see mankind
[1:59:24] today he's acting like monkeys that's
[1:59:28] that maybe he's evolving backwards but
[1:59:30] it's in his actions it's not in his
[1:59:32] looks or any of the doings you know they
[1:59:34] claim we they claim they got these
[1:59:36] skeletons it's billions of years old and
[1:59:40] you know they they do all of that but
[1:59:43] you know them it was back there uh you
[1:59:47] know they all them skeletons out I've
[1:59:49] ever seen you know you know what they
[1:59:50] look like they don't look like
[1:59:53] monkeys they don't look like something
[1:59:56] strange they look kind of like we
[2:00:00] look
[2:00:01] right we see then why haven't we evolved
[2:00:05] to something
[2:00:06] El
[2:00:07] you but see we've not done
[2:00:11] it we believe the Bible you say well
[2:00:15] science can prove this right that's why
[2:00:17] I thank God for a prophet like his
[2:00:19] daughter said one day said but Daddy
[2:00:21] they tell us that the world is billions
[2:00:24] of years old he said that's
[2:00:29] right you'd say well no no no the world
[2:00:32] believes we're here religious World
[2:00:34] believes we've been here 6,000 years
[2:00:36] well
[2:00:37] see that's not what the scripture said
[2:00:40] that in the beginning he created heavens
[2:00:42] and earth you know there's a period
[2:00:45] there not a comma that continues on into
[2:00:48] another point there's a period that fits
[2:00:50] there reason that period is there is
[2:00:53] because in in English you stop and
[2:00:55] think that was the end of the statement
[2:00:58] stop and think about it it's not a
[2:00:59] common to carry on you a comma to carry
[2:01:01] on it means stop and think we see in the
[2:01:05] beginning God created heaven and the
[2:01:06] Earth
[2:01:08] period he could have left it here for
[2:01:10] billions of years before he ever done
[2:01:14] anything we think of him creating the
[2:01:17] world in seven days or we even try to
[2:01:20] multiply it up where to think that he
[2:01:21] was in creation for 7,000 years or
[2:01:27] 6,000 but just remember how easy it is
[2:01:30] to confound
[2:01:31] Man by his own
[2:01:34] wisdom and that's what God does he takes
[2:01:37] the wisdom of
[2:01:38] man and confounds him they can send a
[2:01:42] rocket into space right they can explore
[2:01:45] the moon the stars the planets but you
[2:01:48] know to be able to do that they had to
[2:01:50] go back and get the Bible you've heard
[2:01:52] the story
[2:01:54] right they didn't get none of these
[2:01:55] other books now to be able to prove this
[2:01:57] point they went back and got the Bible
[2:02:00] cuz see in all their calculations and I
[2:02:02] don't understand how it was calculated
[2:02:04] that's but all of their calculations is
[2:02:07] missing one
[2:02:10] day cuz they can't put all those Rockets
[2:02:13] out there in space without knowing where
[2:02:14] they're all going to be cuz they're
[2:02:15] going to run into each other so they got
[2:02:17] to put them in an orbit into things and
[2:02:19] all them so they went back and they
[2:02:21] studied it and this man said well I
[2:02:23] remember one day in the Bible that it
[2:02:26] spoke of a
[2:02:27] day that the sun Stood Still well now
[2:02:30] how they done it I don't
[2:02:32] know but scientifically they ran that
[2:02:35] back to that date and
[2:02:37] time and they found out that there was a
[2:02:39] great vast time missing but it was not
[2:02:42] one whole day it like I believe I'm
[2:02:45] right now if I miss it on the number
[2:02:47] forgive me I believe it was 20 minutes
[2:02:49] they
[2:02:51] likeed well they said okay he said we've
[2:02:53] got you know we're
[2:02:55] close but we we can't do that cuz 20
[2:02:58] minutes would make a vast difference in
[2:03:01] space to be able to put those Rockets up
[2:03:04] there that you wouldn't run into each
[2:03:05] other you know and thing so they said
[2:03:09] well something still wrong with Miss in
[2:03:10] 20 minutes they asked the man said was
[2:03:12] anything else he said well I do remember
[2:03:14] in the Bible that a man asked God one
[2:03:17] time to to extend his life he sent the
[2:03:21] prophet down told him he was going to
[2:03:22] die and said he he was to he asked God
[2:03:25] and God extended his life you remember
[2:03:27] there now somebody give me the name cuz
[2:03:30] my my memor of name is bad but anyhow
[2:03:32] the the man said well you know God
[2:03:36] extend my life he said
[2:03:39] okay he said I'll extend your life for
[2:03:41] 15 years right well that's worst mistake
[2:03:45] he ever made because he sinned if you
[2:03:46] read your Bible after the end so
[2:03:48] horrible he been better off he'd died
[2:03:50] but still he wanted to to do
[2:03:54] that and he said you remember the story
[2:03:57] he said well how do I know that God that
[2:03:59] you're giving me
[2:04:01] this and he said it would be a very easy
[2:04:04] thing Lord for you to make time fly
[2:04:10] forward but said if you would let time
[2:04:13] go
[2:04:14] backward and time went backward on that
[2:04:17] day for so many degrees
[2:04:20] of their thing and they figured that out
[2:04:22] and it was exactly 20
[2:04:25] minutes that was what they needed to
[2:04:27] make the one- day mission in their
[2:04:30] calculations they had to depend upon the
[2:04:33] Bible you know well if he can keep it
[2:04:37] that
[2:04:39] accurate then I believe he can keep all
[2:04:41] of it
[2:04:42] accurate that's the way I depend upon
[2:04:44] the Bible because he can he we can do
[2:04:46] that see because see in trying to figure
[2:04:49] the Bible that's why you you can't do it
[2:04:51] even your Prophet told us do not try to
[2:04:53] deal with with figuring out times and
[2:04:56] this that and the other because you got
[2:04:58] too many
[2:05:00] calculations I remember studying one
[2:05:02] time that they changed the calendar
[2:05:03] system and one time it was changed like
[2:05:06] three times in one year and to do that
[2:05:09] to try to line the star systems back
[2:05:11] up and they put um 13 months into one
[2:05:16] year to make it line up and that one
[2:05:18] year only had 200 something days and uh
[2:05:22] there was just things that science can
[2:05:24] prove let's see God's clock word is
[2:05:26] right on
[2:05:27] time you may have a good watch it may
[2:05:31] keep real good time but it's going to
[2:05:33] miss but they took that and they
[2:05:35] calculated those things and they send
[2:05:37] those Rockets into space and know within
[2:05:40] a split second of where they're
[2:05:43] at that's how smart science is you can't
[2:05:47] deny there scientific ability but you
[2:05:51] know that means there has to be a god
[2:05:54] somewhere that brought that ability to
[2:05:56] man we all life and read the stories of
[2:05:59] how Thor invented the wheel you know the
[2:06:02] cartoon
[2:06:03] character and but you know what day was
[2:06:06] somebody invented a
[2:06:08] wheel and they kept on putting Parks
[2:06:10] together and they wound up with a
[2:06:12] car I don't think it was pedaling by
[2:06:16] bicycle pedals but they wound up
[2:06:20] and then they wound up getting and they
[2:06:21] called it
[2:06:24] horsepower well you know that's always
[2:06:26] been amazing to me because why would
[2:06:29] they call an airplane engine or a car
[2:06:31] engine
[2:06:32] horsepower the best that I can give you
[2:06:34] the answer is that that means the thrust
[2:06:36] are an ability to
[2:06:38] push and you know so they calculate how
[2:06:42] much horsepower it would take to push
[2:06:44] and they got it from the horsepower and
[2:06:46] you know they still calculates
[2:06:47] horsepower as to going into outer space
[2:06:49] sir it takes so much stress power from
[2:06:51] horsepower to go to outer space well
[2:06:53] they're still just on the same old thing
[2:06:55] that we was in the horse and buggy
[2:06:56] that's
[2:06:57] right and I don't mean this is a joke
[2:06:59] but I always told you about it and
[2:07:00] people don't believe it but everybody
[2:07:03] says that a mule pulls a plow now you
[2:07:06] never
[2:07:08] farmed a mule don't pull up a
[2:07:11] p it pushes
[2:07:14] it you see you getting the meal back
[2:07:17] here with the the stop
[2:07:20] no
[2:07:22] no the mule horse or whatever it is it
[2:07:25] has a collar around its neck on that
[2:07:27] collar is what you call a
[2:07:29] gear on that gear is chains connected
[2:07:32] back to whatever you're
[2:07:35] pulling and the mule is pushing the
[2:07:39] plow because he's pushing against the
[2:07:41] collar that's on his
[2:07:43] shoulder and by pushing against it he's
[2:07:46] pulling the plow that's behind you
[2:07:49] so it is horsepower thrust
[2:07:53] power but it brings it down to common
[2:07:55] sense right this Bible is the only thing
[2:07:58] that's
[2:08:01] sensible the Bible is the only thing
[2:08:03] that's sensible the only thing that can
[2:08:06] give you all the
[2:08:08] answers all the other books can't do it
[2:08:10] but the Bible can give you the answer to
[2:08:12] everything you have need of right if
[2:08:14] you'll just read it right but it's just
[2:08:18] like the said what it is the Book of
[2:08:19] Revelations the reason Satan don't want
[2:08:20] you to read it because it's telling
[2:08:22] about
[2:08:24] you telling what wonderful that God FS
[2:08:27] with
[2:08:30] you we'll get to it Wednesday where he
[2:08:32] gets over one about 13 where he turned
[2:08:34] to see the seven golden Candlestick and
[2:08:36] he looked there was one like unto the
[2:08:38] son of man standing in the seven golden
[2:08:39] Candlestick G about to pouch with a
[2:08:43] girdle per this
[2:08:47] fish
[2:08:49] the symbolics has been broke to us
[2:08:51] perhaps it's
[2:08:53] femin that's the bride of
[2:08:57] Christ John falls down to
[2:09:01] worship the bride of
[2:09:05] Christ you said well that's what they
[2:09:07] did over end of the book of Revelation
[2:09:09] but you better hold it now don't hold
[2:09:11] your thoughts too close to that that
[2:09:12] just being the bride of Christ over
[2:09:14] there we've got some things we got to
[2:09:16] bring
[2:09:17] out but but the word of God is perfect
[2:09:21] are you down there yet find out what we
[2:09:23] doing I'm sorry that we're a little late
[2:09:25] but you know can't help that but all
[2:09:29] things work together for good so then
[2:09:31] there nothing else you're getting the
[2:09:32] burden of having to sit and listen to me
[2:09:35] you know talk to you for a while but and
[2:09:38] us to sing and worship
[2:09:40] God cuz see why are we
[2:09:43] here why was man brought
[2:09:47] here
[2:09:49] he worshiped a totem
[2:09:51] pole right cuz he believ that totem pole
[2:09:54] that an imaginary way his God entered
[2:09:57] that totem
[2:09:58] pole that totem pole is not his
[2:10:01] God that's why the Flesh of Jesus
[2:10:04] standing on the Earth was the Flesh of a
[2:10:07] man a
[2:10:11] man they're down there so we ready to
[2:10:13] say the
[2:10:15] prayer okay let's stand together we
[2:10:17] ready to go eat so everybody stays and

[2:10:31] the turkey because he had to make a a
[2:10:33] total commitment today that we could be
[2:10:35] able to eat you know but one of these
[2:10:37] days we can do like the president he
[2:10:39] pardoned a couple of them this time but
[2:10:41] I wonder what's going to happen to them
[2:10:42] to be pardon you know I never did figure
[2:10:44] out what went with them did they turn

[2:10:53] somewhere or another where he meets his
[2:10:55] fate but one of these days we don't have
[2:10:57] to worry about all
[2:10:58] that we'll be over
