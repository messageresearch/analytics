[1:22] over to second Kings chapter 5 and I
[1:29] know just a little topic we were having
[1:32] a little family devotional one night in
[1:35] the last weekend and I was kind of going
[1:38] over the scripture and so I just wanted
[1:41] to talk about this tonight with
[1:42] everybody second Kings chapter 5 verses
[1:45] 1 to 14 but before we go into the word
[1:48] let's go to the author first well God
[1:51] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[1:53] together around your word once more and
[1:55] be able to look into your word Jesus and
[1:57] see a glimpse at who we are now and and
[2:01] what's taking place and we asked Lord
[2:02] Jesus since you'll just come up on the
[2:04] scene for us tonight Lord and we just
[2:05] make you welcome Lord and ask that you
[2:08] would come and for taking the service
[2:09] Lord Jesus and quicken the word to us
[2:11] Lord and let things be said Lord that
[2:13] would help your people we know Lord
[2:15] tonight that many people have journeyed
[2:17] from from your people of journey from
[2:19] from miles around or God through through
[2:21] all the rain and all the dreary weather
[2:23] Lord Jesus and come in the middle of the
[2:25] week after they've been working hard
[2:26] Lord and I pray God that you just be
[2:29] merciful now Lord and speak something
[2:31] little help Lord God and not to hinder
[2:33] Lord Jesus but to be a blessing and we
[2:36] ask toward God that you'll come and just
[2:37] just fellowship with us now Lord God we
[2:40] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:41] Christ amen let me take my shackles off
[2:50] and this is a little story I know you're
[2:54] familiar with it of naming no and it
[3:02] says now naman captain of the host of
[3:04] the king of Assyria was a great man with
[3:07] his master and honorable because by him
[3:09] the Lord had given deliver us unto Syria
[3:11] he was also a mighty man in Valor but he
[3:14] was a leper and the Syrians had gone out
[3:17] by companies and had brought away
[3:19] captive out of the Land of Israel a
[3:20] little maid and she waited on name his
[3:22] wife and she said unto her mistress
[3:25] would God my Lord were with the Prophet
[3:28] that is in Samaria for he would recover
[3:30] him of his leprosy and one went in and
[3:33] told his Lord saying thus and thus said
[3:35] the maid that is of the land of Israel
[3:37] and the king of Syria said go to go and
[3:39] I will send a letter under the king of
[3:41] Israel and he departed and took with him
[3:44] ten talents of silver and six thousand
[3:46] pieces of gold and ten changes of
[3:48] raiment and he brought a letter to the
[3:51] king of Israel saying now when this
[3:52] letter is coming to thee behold I've
[3:54] therewith sent naming my servant indeed
[3:57] that thou may us recover him of his
[3:59] leprosy and it came to pass when the
[4:01] king of Israel had read the letter that
[4:03] he rent his clothes and said and my God
[4:05] to kill and make alive that this man
[4:07] descend unto me to recover a man of his
[4:09] leprosy
[4:10] wherefore consider I pray you and see
[4:12] how he seeketh the quarrel against me
[4:14] and it was so when a lash of the man of
[4:16] God had heard that the king of Israel
[4:18] had rent his clothes that he sent to the
[4:20] king saying wherefore hast thou rent
[4:23] that clothes
[4:24] let him come now to me and he shall know
[4:26] that there is a prophet in Israel so
[4:28] naman came with his horses and with his
[4:30] chariot and stood at the door of the
[4:32] house of Elijah and Elisha sent a
[4:35] messenger unto him saying go and wash in
[4:37] Jordan seven times and I flesh shall
[4:40] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[4:41] clean but naman was wroth and went away
[4:44] and said Behold I thought he will surely
[4:46] come out to me and stand and call on the
[4:49] name of the Lord is God and strike his
[4:51] hand over the place and recover the
[4:53] leper are not abana and far par rivers
[4:56] of Damascus better than all the waters
[4:58] of Israel may I'm not watching them and
[5:01] be clean
[5:01] so he turned and went away in a rage and
[5:04] his servants came near and speaking to
[5:07] him and said my father if the Prophet
[5:09] had bid thee do some great thing would
[5:11] esand out what us they'll not have done
[5:13] it
[5:14] how much rather than when he saith to
[5:16] thee wash and be clean at the end when
[5:20] he down and dipped himself seven times
[5:23] in Jordan according to the saying of the
[5:25] man of God and his flesh came again like
[5:29] under the flesh of a little child and he
[5:32] was clean you can be seated the Lord is
[5:34] a blessing to the world now that was a
[5:39] long little story longer reading of that
[5:41] read and and you know one thing I find
[5:44] that it's very interesting is is there's
[5:46] so many little nuggets in the in these
[5:48] little these are all the Old Testament
[5:50] stories especially I really love second
[5:53] Kings there's so many good good little
[5:55] stories you know that an evangelist or
[5:58] somebody could take and really preach
[5:59] from and like this story and this story
[6:02] it starts off with a very peculiar
[6:04] description of a little unnamed lady a
[6:07] little maid that it says that she had a
[6:09] testimony and and you know maybe so
[6:12] maybe I'll start with that this morning
[6:13] as you know a lot of times you can get
[6:15] into the position where you think that
[6:16] you your life is just kind of you're not
[6:19] very important maybe to the to the
[6:21] message as a whole you know or maybe
[6:23] sometimes ministers even can kind of
[6:24] begin to think well I don't have a
[6:26] worldwide ministry or something like
[6:28] that
[6:28] and you know we get to a place where we
[6:30] want a name we it's human nature you
[6:33] want you want somebody to know your name
[6:35] and to have a have a name for yourself
[6:37] and all these kind of things but but in
[6:39] this story it starts off with a little
[6:42] unnamed person little maid that nobody
[6:45] maybe even really regarded it doesn't
[6:46] even say what her name was in the Bible
[6:48] but she'd made a testimony and she her
[6:51] word that her testimony God all the way
[6:54] up to the king of Syria I got all the
[6:56] way up to naimans house and naman began
[6:59] to wonder I wonder what's going on down
[7:02] in Israel I hear tale of a prophet I
[7:04] hear tell of it the word being preached
[7:06] maybe I should make my way down there so
[7:09] that I can so we'll say it like this so
[7:12] that I so that my body can be changed
[7:14] because I got something wrong in my body
[7:16] I got leprosy in my body I'm sick and I
[7:18] need I need a body I need a body change
[7:21] so naman he after hearing this little
[7:24] testimony of this little uh unnamed
[7:25] person he begins to go down to Israel to
[7:30] hear the word of the Lord and and we get
[7:32] when he gets down there
[7:33] he says Elisha doesn't doesn't even come
[7:37] out to greet him doesn't even come out
[7:39] to and and so that's really what I want
[7:41] to I want to preach up on the night is
[7:43] the topic of how God will try you to see
[7:46] what your reaction is on his word he
[7:49] will give you a little incident or thing
[7:51] or give you things in your life to to
[7:53] give you a little test and see what your
[7:55] reaction is going to be now Elisha when
[7:58] he hears when he hears the prophet and
[8:02] sees that he doesn't even come out to
[8:04] his he says he never got so upset
[8:09] he's got wroth and he went away and he
[8:11] said behold I thought he would surely
[8:15] come out to me and call on the name of
[8:19] the Lord his God that he thought that he
[8:21] would come out and make a big to-do and
[8:23] make all this grin show and he thought
[8:25] that this church service would operate
[8:27] in the way that he wanted it to do he
[8:29] thought that everything that he wanted
[8:31] he wanted let's say the pastor and and
[8:33] and the ministers and everything to
[8:35] operate in the way that he thought it
[8:37] should work but a lot of times God does
[8:40] not do things the way that we think it
[8:42] should do the way that we think it
[8:44] should work and he said he said and
[8:47] strike his hand over the place and
[8:50] recover the leper that he would make a
[8:52] great big show and strike the place and
[8:55] and maybe have a big a great big
[8:57] grandiose prayer and all those kind of
[8:59] things but it didn't happen the way that
[9:01] he expected and furthermore he was he
[9:05] was asked to go down into the muddy
[9:07] Jordan River and dip seven times and you
[9:11] know
[9:14] you know that you could you could take a
[9:16] look at seven times seven times a lot of
[9:19] different ways yes it's been a long hard
[9:21] journey from the death of Christ all the
[9:23] way through seven Church ages it's been
[9:26] a long hard journey through through
[9:28] seven messenger seven all seven things
[9:30] seven seals Daniels 666 fold purpose and
[9:35] a lot of times we can begin to discount
[9:37] the thing that will actually bring us to
[9:40] our body change we can begin to devalue
[9:43] the thing that will actually help us to
[9:45] get to the end goal you see what God is
[9:48] doing is he's trying us to see whether
[9:50] we what where are we where we place our
[9:53] treasures our treasuring the things of
[9:55] the world is our treasure our pride is
[9:58] our pressure a great big old egos and
[10:00] having a name and all these kind of
[10:02] things or is it actually going or let's
[10:05] say almost like slogging through the the
[10:08] breeding and studying and seeing them
[10:11] the word slowly unfold he because you
[10:14] see with many times we get to a place
[10:16] where we want somebody like a minister
[10:18] just come over our house and just kind
[10:19] of download it right into our brain and
[10:21] explain it all to us but it's a long
[10:23] slow process and and I want to maybe
[10:29] just kind of compare the dip in the
[10:31] seven times into the River Jordan
[10:32] dipping in that muddy water something
[10:35] that seems undesirable let's compare
[10:37] that to maybe maybe like Daniels 70
[10:40] weeks where it where it seems it's very
[10:43] laborious and all of these things but
[10:44] you realize tonight what Daniels 70
[10:47] weeks really is Daniels 70 weeks is
[10:50] talking about a six fold purpose whether
[10:52] whether the Jews rejected their pardon
[10:55] but now they're going to get a chance to
[10:57] receive their pardon and not just to
[11:00] receive the pardon that they reject it
[11:01] and not just not just be born again but
[11:04] actually all of the worship all of the
[11:06] tabernacle all of that will be restored
[11:09] everything will be restored back to
[11:11] where they have the original worship
[11:13] back again does that sound familiar does
[11:17] that sound familiar to you and and and
[11:20] you begin to think maybe well I wonder
[11:23] if we really
[11:24] Daniel's 70 weeks so much of the same
[11:26] thing maybe with the seals it seems so
[11:28] complicated and everything to really
[11:30] understand the seals at first of all
[11:33] you've got to understand Daniel 70 weeks
[11:35] because when you begin to understand
[11:36] Daniel 70 weeks then you can begin to
[11:39] see the pattern you can begin to see the
[11:41] timeline you can be seen again to see
[11:43] the same way that God has dealt with the
[11:46] redemption of the Israelites he will
[11:49] deal with you he is dealing with you
[11:50] right now because God it's just he keeps
[11:54] repeating cycles when as the seals open
[11:57] up you can begin to see the whole plan
[12:00] of redemption you can begin to see how
[12:03] God redeemed you how he's redeeming the
[12:05] earth how he's taking you through a
[12:07] process of a justification and
[12:10] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[12:12] goes to all of these virtues being
[12:14] sealed in to make you the full stature
[12:16] of a perfect man and that he's revealed
[12:18] to you that he has justified your flesh
[12:21] and sanctified your reflection so that
[12:23] he could come and live inside of you and
[12:25] and make reveal to you Colossians 1:26
[12:28] 27 that Christ is tabernacled inside of
[12:31] you he's broke that he's brought the
[12:33] bride through a complete but he's
[12:35] bringing this now through a complete
[12:37] plan of redemption and and all of those
[12:39] things maybe a seat might seem to us
[12:41] kind of like muddy like dipping down in
[12:44] the river Jordan but it is the process
[12:46] by which God will change your body it's
[12:49] the process by which God will make your
[12:52] body clean just like naimans now now
[12:55] naman didn't see the seals and all those
[12:57] kind of things but yeah yeah he was
[13:00] tried just the same way as you and I are
[13:02] and many of us today we're sitting in
[13:04] the church looking at me and and
[13:06] wondering what we're doing here
[13:08] wondering if it's maybe worth your time
[13:10] and and all of these kind of things but
[13:13] you see what God is doing is he's trying
[13:15] you to see where your treasure is your
[13:18] treasure laid up in earth or is your
[13:20] treasure laid up in heaven do you value
[13:22] the struggles and the trials and all the
[13:25] different kind of things knowing that
[13:27] God is molding you into his image
[13:29] molding you into the statue of a perfect
[13:31] man and the
[13:32] that he doesn't see as you eat the word
[13:35] he gives you trials to come and test it
[13:37] he'll have somebody say something nasty
[13:39] to you or many times like a name in this
[13:41] case it might even be a minister it
[13:43] might be somebody where you think well
[13:45] this person should be above that this
[13:47] person should not treat me in this way I
[13:49] expect them to do that do more I expect
[13:52] like he said I expect Elijah to come out
[13:55] and greet me I expect Elijah to do all
[13:57] these kind of things but it didn't work
[13:59] out that way in naimans case because
[14:02] what's God doing he's trying is he's
[14:04] testing us to see whether we will stay
[14:06] with the word whether we value the word
[14:09] enough to keep moving forward in Luke
[14:13] chapter 4 verse 27 jesus said in many
[14:16] lepers were in Israel in the time of
[14:18] Elizabeth's the prophet Elijah and none
[14:21] of them was cleansed saying naming the
[14:24] Syria you think about you think about
[14:26] the rarity are all these lepers in Syria
[14:29] and it was only one only one that went
[14:33] all the way down into Israel because you
[14:35] see it's a personal walk it's a personal
[14:37] individual walk as I look out upon the
[14:40] congregation this evening everybody is
[14:42] going through their own individual
[14:44] trials everybody's going through their
[14:45] own individual struggles and some people
[14:48] will come all the way to adoption some
[14:51] people will not be able to do that it's
[14:53] an individual walk and you can't force
[14:55] anybody to do what everybody's going if
[14:56] they're their own pace and God's dealing
[14:59] with them in their own individual
[15:00] characteristic way and that's why God
[15:02] will give you it's a different kind of
[15:04] trial then he gives other people it will
[15:07] give you a hill he's molding you and
[15:08] somebody that's a little baby will get a
[15:10] different kind of trial that is that is
[15:12] a more adult level because adults adults
[15:16] KITT can handle more God well you know
[15:18] brother that the Bible says that God
[15:19] will never give you more than you can
[15:21] handle and then the door can handle more
[15:24] than a little baby or no adults should
[15:27] be able to adult an adult should be
[15:29] getting close to driving the car and can
[15:31] deal with deal with those kind of things
[15:32] dealing dealing with all the the things
[15:34] that go with well let's say a little
[15:36] baby a little baby is more concerned
[15:38] with who's sitting in my spot when
[15:41] you're driving in the car they're in the
[15:42] backseat in there and get out of my spot
[15:45] stuff like that who stole my lollipop
[15:46] but an adult has problems like like the
[15:50] IRS audit or somebody tech not how to
[15:53] pay your taxes and and and and maybe a
[15:56] speeding ticket you see the bloo-bloop
[15:58] of a car pulling up behind you because a
[15:59] little baby doesn't have to deal with a
[16:01] speeding ticket but an adult will have
[16:03] to deal with with a different set of
[16:05] requirements that you have you see so
[16:07] you're gonna have a different set of
[16:09] trials as you grow up and so when you
[16:11] see somebody reacting like a little baby
[16:15] you may not have heard of a i'ma quote
[16:18] somebody that's not I don't know if a
[16:20] Christian or not but they're like a
[16:21] well-known philosopher Jordan Peterson
[16:23] he said the ugliest thing there is is is
[16:27] an overgrown baby and and that's true in
[16:29] the gospel to the ugliest thing there is
[16:31] is as what's supposed to be an adult
[16:34] acting like a little child acting you
[16:36] know crying over spilt milk and doing
[16:38] little things like that because you you
[16:41] look at somebody and you're supposed to
[16:43] be an adult but yet you're you're
[16:45] whining and crying and boohoo and over
[16:47] somebody stole your pacifier or whatever
[16:49] and you see but see everybody has
[16:52] different trials everybody everybody
[16:54] goes through different things and and
[16:56] what's big to one person might be small
[16:59] to the other person and vice versa let
[17:06] me read this Matthew chapter 6 verse 19
[17:09] 21 says lay up for yourselves lay not up
[17:11] for yourselves treasures upon earth
[17:13] where moth and rust doth corrupt and
[17:16] where thieves break through and steal
[17:19] but lay up for yourselves treasures in
[17:22] heaven where neither moth nor rust doth
[17:25] corrupt and where thieves did not break
[17:27] through nor steal for where your
[17:29] treasure is there will your heart be
[17:31] also now in naimans case where his
[17:35] treasure was his treasure was he wanted
[17:37] to get that promise of the Prophet that
[17:40] he wanted to get the benefit of the
[17:42] Prophet at all cost if of course in
[17:45] Italy it got him a little upset and
[17:47] everything and his service had to talk
[17:49] to him and everything but he did
[17:50] eventually go down and dip in the water
[17:52] but where your treasure is will
[17:56] your reaction to the word a lot of times
[17:58] things that that happen in church and
[18:01] everything honestly it's it's rough I
[18:03] say this to my family all the time you
[18:05] think you think initially being a
[18:07] Christian is just a flowery better visas
[18:09] a flowery but just a bed of roses that
[18:12] nobody has any disagreements and
[18:14] everything is just wonderful and
[18:16] everything but when you get really get
[18:17] started it there's a lot of tough time
[18:20] being a Christian is hard walking this
[18:22] Christian walk is hard that God has
[18:25] given you a power in the inside of you
[18:27] to walk to be able to walk this journey
[18:29] and when you when you can grasp the
[18:32] treasure of being able to take a body
[18:35] change of eternal life of all these
[18:37] things that are included the benefits
[18:39] that are included in this message
[18:41] those are greater than than any kind of
[18:43] worldly pleasure any kind of worldly
[18:46] thing the early disciples they devalue
[18:48] their life so much that they were
[18:49] willing to be crucified upside down
[18:52] eaten by lions sawn asunder to all those
[18:55] things because their treasure was in
[18:57] heaven where your treasure is is where
[19:00] your heart will be where your treasure
[19:02] is determines what your reaction is so
[19:05] just just keep dippin just keep just
[19:08] keep watch seven times make a little
[19:11] cake like that all these different
[19:13] people in the Bible that that they just
[19:15] kept moving forward tarry at Jerusalem
[19:18] Jesus total go tear your Jerusalem
[19:20] weight up in that ripple room until
[19:22] you're in do with power on high do the
[19:24] things that are required by the word
[19:26] March you seven times around the city is
[19:29] what they're worth the word of the Lord
[19:31] that Joshua would just mark keep
[19:32] marching around just do it do it do what
[19:35] I said eat the little book to John and
[19:38] you know a lot of times these are the
[19:40] things these are the things in the Bible
[19:42] that are so difficult for us to actually
[19:44] fulfill to actually we say you know when
[19:49] you read in Revelation where John eight
[19:51] that little book it was easy for him to
[19:52] eat the book but then when it began to
[19:55] be manifested in his life it was bitter
[19:57] in his belly
[19:58] why because this it's like birth pains
[20:01] it's like something coming forth and
[20:03] when that's when you people begin to
[20:06] ridicule you and mock you and and and
[20:08] those
[20:08] kind of things are it's not easy like we
[20:12] were when we went on vacation a week or
[20:14] so ago we were we were kind of walking
[20:16] through a little exhibit on the side of
[20:19] the road well I got one of those little
[20:20] villages that you can you can see and we
[20:23] were shocked to see that somebody was
[20:25] taking pictures of our family like we
[20:27] were I don't know Amish or something
[20:28] that were so amazed at us and you know
[20:31] you have to kind of you go through
[20:33] things in life where one day we were
[20:34] walking on an on a walking path in the
[20:37] city where we live and there was this
[20:39] group of girls that began to porn and
[20:40] laugh at the way that my wife and my
[20:42] daughters were were dressed and it's
[20:45] like people now that nowadays it's
[20:46] become to the point where they openly
[20:48] mock you and those things are not easy
[20:51] it's not easy but our treasures are not
[20:53] in this world and that's why we don't
[20:55] dress like this world because we dress
[20:57] where we're going to when you're going
[20:59] to bed you dress for the bed but where
[21:02] we're dressing for our eternal
[21:04] destination that's why we dress
[21:06] differently because we're not dressing
[21:08] for the things of this world you see we
[21:15] we're not we're not called just it just
[21:17] to understand the thing all these deep
[21:19] things we're not just called just to
[21:21] understand the letter and everything but
[21:22] we're actually called to fulfill it to
[21:25] be there written to be the the the
[21:27] vindication of the word so you say you
[21:33] can say well you know I I'll keep moving
[21:36] on I'll keep moving on as as long as
[21:38] it's not muddy like name and as long as
[21:39] we don't get into the mud as as long as
[21:41] I find the journey pleasing as long as
[21:44] I'm as I'm treated fairly like the way
[21:47] that I think that I should be treated
[21:49] then I'll just keep moving on but maybe
[21:52] God is trying you maybe God is testing
[21:54] you a little bit to see how much you
[21:56] value the word because jesus said in
[22:00] looking at chapter 9 verse 62 and jesus
[22:02] said unto him no man having put his hand
[22:05] to the plow and looking back is fit for
[22:09] the kingdom of God no man having put his
[22:11] hand to the plow and thought I I wonder
[22:14] if this is all really worth it I wonder
[22:18] if maybe like Lot's wife we begin to put
[22:20] your hand to the plow or
[22:21] you didn't have a plow but she turned by
[22:23] to remember all the things our family I
[22:27] think there's a quote where brother
[22:28] grounder said she began to think about
[22:29] the family that she left she began to
[22:32] just kind of yearn to go back and sit in
[22:35] front of the fire and all those kind of
[22:37] things see how her heart was not in it
[22:40] her heart was not her treasure was not
[22:43] in the word the word was not her
[22:45] treasure you see the Matthew chapter 23
[22:51] verse 23 to 24 says woe unto you scribes
[22:53] and Pharisees hypocrites for you paid
[22:56] tithe of mint and anise and cumin and
[22:58] have emitted the weight of your matters
[22:59] of the law judgment and mercy and faith
[23:02] these all you have done and not to leave
[23:04] the other to other undone because you
[23:07] see so many times will put more weight
[23:09] will put more weight on on these big
[23:11] things of the Bible understanding the
[23:13] mysteries and everything and and will
[23:15] just what kind of leave undone the
[23:17] smaller thing or the weightier things
[23:19] that seems small to us of actually
[23:22] fulfilling the word of actually
[23:24] fulfilling it like actually instead of
[23:27] you know just understanding that we need
[23:29] to love our neighbor actually loving our
[23:32] neighbor actually instead of just maybe
[23:35] understanding a deep understanding a
[23:37] deeper revelation of the mysteries but
[23:39] being merciful to one another with
[23:41] somebody wronged you to be merciful to
[23:43] them and and and listen to this judgment
[23:46] mercy and faith judgment being able to
[23:50] judge right from wrong and be end up
[23:52] being able to judge one another being
[23:54] able to fairly judge one another and see
[23:57] that these things these are things that
[23:58] Jesus said we we kind of get all out of
[24:01] whack we strain an ad out and we'll
[24:05] swallow a camel we'll spend all this
[24:08] time in this area but not so much in
[24:10] this area and when I as I get to the
[24:13] closing of the message later tonight
[24:15] what I'm getting it really is that you
[24:17] know we're striving for our body change
[24:20] we're striving for for all these things
[24:23] for a greater anointing from God for the
[24:26] greater opening of the word but there's
[24:27] these little things of just forgiveness
[24:30] to one another and just living with one
[24:32] another
[24:33] and loving one another that our
[24:35] requirements they must be done to take a
[24:38] body change and and they're all part of
[24:40] the word and they're and they're and
[24:42] part part of dipping down in the water
[24:44] into that muddy water but they must be
[24:46] done it is a requirement it's not enough
[24:49] just to say that I believe it but you
[24:52] must actually vindicate it you are the
[24:55] vindication and the vindication is when
[24:57] the word comes alive and it is proved
[24:59] because the vindication of the word is
[25:01] the interpretation of the word right so
[25:03] when the word is interpreted in your
[25:05] life it is vindicated I'm gonna skip
[25:10] over there let's say just kind of moving
[25:13] through this pretty quickly
[25:16] a job chapter 23 you talk about somebody
[25:18] that knew about being tried Jobe knew by
[25:20] being tried and he said in John chapter
[25:23] 23 verses 8 to 13 behold I go forward
[25:26] but he is not there and backward but I
[25:29] cannot perceive him on the left hand
[25:31] where he doesn't work but I cannot
[25:33] behold him he hided himself on the right
[25:35] hand then I cannot see him but he said I
[25:39] when I go this way I can't I can't
[25:42] perceive God everywhere I go I can't
[25:44] receive him but he knoweth the way that
[25:47] I take when he hath tried me I shall
[25:50] come forth as gold my foot has held his
[25:54] steps his way have I kept and not
[25:56] decline neither how about going back
[25:58] from the commandment of his lips
[26:00] I have esteem the words of his mouth
[26:02] more than my necessary food now that's
[26:06] somebody taken taken the Word of God and
[26:08] really a value as there was a treasure
[26:11] more even than his necessary food is the
[26:15] way that Joe valued it so let's look at
[26:18] bring up that Hebrew lexicon of the word
[26:21] try there because the word tried is
[26:24] talking about to examine
[26:32] to examine try prove to test to test it
[26:38] out and and see what's really there in
[26:41] other words what God is doing is we say
[26:44] we're born again so he'll come and and
[26:46] test what you think boy being born again
[26:48] but being born again Diaz he'll give you
[26:50] a little test you say you've got
[26:51] knowledge you you know send a little
[26:53] trial on you're waiting and test your
[26:55] knowledge
[26:55] you've got brotherly kindness you say I
[26:58] believe I've got brotherly kindness and
[26:59] he'll see that he'll give you a little
[27:01] test to see whether you actually have
[27:03] brotherly kindness or not and if you
[27:05] don't don't despair go back and and
[27:08] begin to pray and seek after God and
[27:10] study the word find out what the true
[27:12] definition according to the Word of
[27:13] brotherly kindness is and keep keep
[27:16] moving up because these trials are given
[27:18] to us by God to see to help us
[27:21] positionally know where we are and to
[27:24] move us toward the goal the trial is
[27:26] actually helping to form us because
[27:29] because without that external pressure
[27:31] you won't grow into the correct image
[27:33] you won't be able to manifest the word
[27:35] in the right way so God sends you trials
[27:38] but part of this growing is as an
[27:40] examination part of the examination is
[27:43] that you need to examine yourself Psalm
[27:47] 29 26 2 says examine me O Lord and prove
[27:51] me try my reins and my heart
[27:56] second Corinthians chapter 13 5 says
[27:59] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[28:02] faith prove your own selves know you not
[28:05] your own selves how that Jesus Christ is
[28:08] in you except ye be reprobates I think
[28:11] this is really the age where people do
[28:13] not examine themselves as much anymore
[28:15] there's no moment of self reflection and
[28:18] self meditation and self-examination we
[28:21] does so many people are just more
[28:22] concerned with how they appear on
[28:24] Instagram or Facebook than to actually
[28:26] sit in a quiet moment of reflection I
[28:28] think did I really need to say that to
[28:31] that person is there something may be
[28:33] wrong with me as my attitude right it's
[28:36] my spirit right within myself am I am I
[28:38] am i treating others the way that I
[28:41] should do you know let's be honest I
[28:43] even when I'm done with a point a sermon
[28:46] how many times I'll go with my wife
[28:47] knows this cuz I think what it was I too
[28:49] harsh did I just because you're
[28:51] examining yourself was I did I beat the
[28:54] people am i approaching this with a
[28:56] right spirit do I have the right
[28:57] attitude when I get up behind the pulpit
[28:59] and you know you sometimes you'll hear
[29:01] people say well I never think about what
[29:03] I say to people and you begin to wonder
[29:05] is that person really approaching things
[29:08] with the right the right mode of and
[29:10] objective because there should be a time
[29:12] when when we get along through ourselves
[29:14] and maybe when you're driving in the car
[29:16] the way to work or whatever and you
[29:18] begin to think about your life and you
[29:19] begin to think about where you are and
[29:21] examine yourself so I know maybe this is
[29:25] maybe this is not a very deep teaching
[29:27] or whatever about these things I believe
[29:29] are needful because we're not
[29:31] predestinated just to understand the
[29:33] deep mysteries of the word but we're
[29:34] predestinated to actually fulfill it to
[29:37] become it we're we're predestinated to
[29:39] love one another and to love the world
[29:41] to love our neighbors as ourselves and
[29:43] to fulfill all of these things in the
[29:45] scripture that that see mama when
[29:48] brother Brennan preached the seven seals
[29:49] and all these things these were not
[29:51] preached just to dangle them out in
[29:53] front of us and give us like an
[29:54] unattainable goal but these are things
[29:56] that somebody is going to attain to
[29:59] somebody is going to become the living
[30:01] reality of these things that he preached
[30:04] somebody's going to have
[30:05] brotherly kindness that seems so
[30:08] unattainable almost where you can love
[30:10] somebody so much that you're ready that
[30:12] you're ready to give your life for them
[30:14] you're ready to drive across the country
[30:16] form you ready just to do whatever
[30:17] you're ready to lay down your life but I
[30:20] believe now is the time but we should be
[30:22] getting serious about things and examine
[30:25] ourselves to see whether we really do
[30:27] have the new birth or not whether we
[30:29] really do have the things that we're
[30:30] talking about whether whether we really
[30:33] do mean what we say even it won't Paul
[30:37] when he was explaining what communion
[30:39] was in first Corinthians chapter 11 he
[30:41] said but let a man examine himself and
[30:44] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[30:47] of that Cup
[30:48] eat drink and eat after what after a
[30:51] period a process of self-examination not
[30:55] just flippantly not just like well you
[30:58] know what waiting until you waiting
[31:00] until at this the day of communion and
[31:02] you're at 30 minutes out and you're just
[31:04] kind of quickly well yeah I think I'm
[31:07] all right
[31:07] but I believe we should be getting
[31:09] serious about things that really begin
[31:11] to meditate on where we are with God and
[31:14] get along with God sometime and let him
[31:16] speak back to you I you know I believe
[31:18] that's one of the things that you can
[31:20] accomplish in prayer is when you get
[31:22] along with God sometimes he will
[31:23] identify things that are lacking in your
[31:27] life that you may not have even been
[31:28] aware of because God is trying you and
[31:33] see God will allow allow Satan to bring
[31:38] fiery trials to test you he will allow
[31:41] the devil he'll allow things to happen
[31:44] to you in church he'll allow things to
[31:47] happen to you in your workplace and and
[31:49] it'll allow as you grow up and maturity
[31:52] will allow the pressures of life to just
[31:55] squeeze in on you and it's God
[31:56] permitting it to tipper you as brother
[31:59] Branham said and three kinds of
[32:00] believers he'll do he'll try to tell you
[32:04] these trials and things is your God
[32:06] trying to put punishment on you it isn't
[32:08] so no service Satan doing that and God
[32:13] permitting it see God's allowing it
[32:16] because he knows that it will be
[32:17] beneficial to you
[32:19] the devil can't do one thing to you
[32:22] without God allowing it God permitting
[32:26] it to temper you to make you see if you
[32:29] if you are tied to this earth by the
[32:34] earth cares of whether your treasures is
[32:37] in heaven in other words how much do you
[32:42] really value the world do you value the
[32:45] word so little that if somebody rubs you
[32:48] the wrong way you're just gonna throw up
[32:50] your hands and and just still pitch a
[32:52] little tantrum do you value the word so
[32:54] much that maybe Menino I believe if if
[32:59] you really value the word sometimes you
[33:02] just have to press through it you just
[33:05] got to take it by force
[33:06] you just got to endure to the end you
[33:09] just got to run the race and if nobody
[33:12] else is willing to run the race well you
[33:14] be the one to run the race well because
[33:17] the prize is worth more than anything
[33:19] it's worth more than anything you can
[33:21] see the prize is worth eternal life it's
[33:25] being able to fellowship whether your
[33:28] brothers and sisters in eternity forever
[33:31] being able to live with Christ forever
[33:33] being able to sit in that New Jerusalem
[33:36] forever and ever and ever throughout all
[33:38] eternity the price is worth it all it's
[33:41] worth more than all the pleasures of
[33:44] young people it's more worth more than
[33:46] all the movies and all the comic books
[33:48] and all the different things that you
[33:50] can get in trap with and and caught up
[33:53] with all the pleasures of this life this
[33:56] is eternal life we're talking about
[33:57] store up your treasures in heaven
[34:00] brother Brahim said in three kinds of
[34:03] believers he said sometimes believers
[34:04] put to the test not sometimes every time
[34:08] he said forever son that cometh to God
[34:11] must be chasing tried child train
[34:15] remember the trials the dusty roads the
[34:19] hot Sun of persecution but the loyalty
[34:22] of your heart beats that material till
[34:24] she was ready to go into the mold God's
[34:28] children is made up correctly on his
[34:31] word
[34:31] for they are living examples and the
[34:35] Word of God living through them see the
[34:37] trial comes to shake you to put you to
[34:41] the very bottom to see where you'll
[34:44] stand they tested try every son that
[34:48] cometh to God
[34:50] Jonah went through the trials and the
[34:52] tests his children taking everything
[34:54] else taken the church members come
[34:56] accused him of being a secret center and
[34:58] tried to say everything against him but
[35:02] yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he
[35:05] knowed he had met God's requirements he
[35:07] know there's no need of Satan trying to
[35:10] tempt him he knowed it was the devil and
[35:12] as long as Satan can make him believe
[35:16] that his sickness was his God doing it
[35:18] he had job will but when job one struck
[35:23] that revelation that it was not God he
[35:25] was only going through his trials to
[35:28] make him something it wasn't God doing
[35:31] it it was Satan doing it listen many of
[35:37] these kind of things the statements that
[35:39] brother Branham makes and things that
[35:41] are in the Bible you know you get to a
[35:43] place in your life where you can look at
[35:45] those things and you say I've been there
[35:48] before I've been I'll tell you a little
[35:51] example of a little thing my you know
[35:54] sometimes the devil will put in your
[35:56] mind a born-again believer can get mind
[35:59] trials and mind sickness and just after
[36:02] my son was born and just before my extra
[36:04] was born my wife began to have this mind
[36:06] sickness thing and and you know the
[36:08] devil putting all these thoughts in her
[36:10] heads and it was just a really horrible
[36:13] time it was the devil just kind of
[36:15] putting all these all these thoughts on
[36:17] her and just it was it was absolutely
[36:20] terrible just to kind of illustrate how
[36:22] terrible it was one morning my little
[36:24] boy got up and he he came over to the
[36:26] breakfast table and he said daddy is
[36:28] mama gonna die because he could see all
[36:30] the turmoil and all the things that we
[36:32] were going through and how horrible it
[36:34] was and different people would call us
[36:37] on the phone and they would say what
[36:38] brother branham just said you must have
[36:40] a secret sin in your life but I
[36:43] new I didn't have a secret sin in my
[36:44] life but just to be sure I went to God
[36:47] and isolated prayer just to make sure
[36:50] that everything was alright and I stayed
[36:53] in prayer before God and I labored and
[36:55] she would go to churches and people
[36:57] would pray for and then people would
[36:59] call me on the phone and they would say
[37:01] why don't you just cast that out why
[37:03] don't you just speak it and I was oh God
[37:06] was there something wrong with me is
[37:08] there something wrong but you see God
[37:10] was molded me into a place where I could
[37:13] trust him into a place where I could
[37:16] just blame everything on God and you see
[37:19] after you go through trials like that
[37:21] you begin to look at the little things
[37:23] with a different perspective because
[37:25] there are big things and they're little
[37:27] thing God will put a trial on you to
[37:29] form you into the right mode and in the
[37:31] right way that you should be and I began
[37:34] to pray and to call out to God and to
[37:36] ask him to come and move on the scene
[37:38] and one night we were sitting there on
[37:41] the couch and I was speaking words of
[37:43] encouragement and combatant whatever the
[37:45] devil the lie of the devil and I was
[37:47] speaking words of encouragement and it
[37:49] was like through the window and when
[37:51] just just annoying if Holy Ghost came in
[37:54] and she began to jump up and praise God
[37:57] I forget to jump praise God and just
[38:00] give glory to God and it was like slowly
[38:04] and surely over seven days the thing
[38:07] left until she was completely delivered
[38:09] and never has had any problem with that
[38:11] but you see God God equips us for those
[38:15] things that you see I was equipped in
[38:17] that hour because I had also gone
[38:19] through that thing before before we were
[38:22] married where the devil will come and
[38:23] put all these lives and you and tell you
[38:25] it's too late for you to be saved and
[38:27] all these kind of things he'll put you
[38:30] he'll put you to the test to see whether
[38:32] you really value the Word of God or not
[38:35] and I'm sharing these I'm sure this is a
[38:37] very personal thing I'm sharing with you
[38:39] to encourage you to bolster you up in
[38:42] the faith to let you know that that you
[38:45] might feel like you're all alone that
[38:47] nobody else is going through trials and
[38:50] the things that you are
[38:52] I believe that God allows these things
[38:54] to happen so that you will turn aside
[38:57] from all other friends and let God be
[39:01] the only love of your life he'll get you
[39:03] along with him so that you'll know that
[39:05] there is a God in the pride he'll know
[39:08] that there is you'll know there is God
[39:10] in Israel and you'll be confident of him
[39:13] you'll put all of your faith I'll say
[39:15] like that you put all of your eggs in
[39:17] one basket because God is everything I
[39:21] believe that this gospel was sent so
[39:23] that we would not just learn about God
[39:26] but fall in love with him fall in love
[39:28] with him and know him on a personal
[39:30] basis first Corinthians chapter 3 says
[39:36] for other foundation can no man lay than
[39:39] that is laid which is Jesus Christ now
[39:43] if any man build upon this foundation
[39:45] gold silver precious stones wood hay
[39:48] stubble every man's work shall be made
[39:50] manifest for the day shall declare it
[39:53] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[39:56] the fire shall try every man's work of
[39:59] what it is the fire is what you will try
[40:03] your work to expose it to reveal it the
[40:05] fire is what will try the three Hebrew
[40:08] children when they testify that we will
[40:10] not bow to this idol we will not bow to
[40:13] this image that you have made of the
[40:15] Prophet the prophets message is all good
[40:18] and everything well that we will not bow
[40:19] down to this and they went into the fire
[40:21] and the fire exposed that their faith
[40:24] was real and genuine the fire exposed
[40:28] that the fiery trials is what is maybe
[40:33] the most beneficial thing in our life
[40:35] you know I look back at so many trials
[40:37] that I've gone through and I I just I II
[40:39] they were hard to go through but I just
[40:42] thank God for allowing me to go through
[40:44] them I remember when I was laid off
[40:49] Skeeter
[40:50] when I was laid off from my job they
[40:53] gave me my final paycheck in my pocket
[40:55] and I I took it back to the car and I
[40:57] drove to take one of my children to go
[41:00] to the doctor and I I began to a
[41:03] around and it was gone and it was a cold
[41:05] wintry wind it went windy day and I
[41:09] looked around and I was surely it had
[41:12] blown away in the wind and I began to
[41:14] call out to God God I that's I don't
[41:16] have a job now I don't have any I don't
[41:18] have any income you now that that only
[41:22] the last paycheck and I had has fallen
[41:25] out of my pocket and has blown away in
[41:27] this gust of wind and I turned around
[41:30] after I said I said God you've got to do
[41:32] something for me now and I turned around
[41:34] and the wind was still blowing just as
[41:36] heavy as it was before but there on the
[41:39] pavement was my paycheck and it was it
[41:41] was moving in the wind like that but it
[41:43] wasn't going anywhere and I walked over
[41:45] and picked it up off the ground listen
[41:47] God is a real God this message has been
[41:50] given to you so that you can know and
[41:52] personally the message is not just so
[41:55] that you can understand it by the letter
[41:57] but it's got to come off the page and
[41:59] becoming a living reality in your life
[42:01] because God is real and it's the fire
[42:05] that will make it manifest in your life
[42:06] if it wasn't for that moment I would
[42:09] have never realized that God was able to
[42:11] do something like that if it wasn't for
[42:14] that moment in my wife's life I would
[42:15] never realize the grace of God to come
[42:18] down on the scene and deliver all these
[42:20] things that God has done to prove that
[42:23] he is real to us let's see there's got
[42:33] to be in evidence that's what God is
[42:37] trying us because there's got to be an
[42:40] evidence when someone accuses you
[42:42] there's got to be an evident when you go
[42:44] to court there's got to be an evidence
[42:45] there's an evidence of whether the thing
[42:47] is right or not there's got to be an
[42:50] evidence the Bible says that faith is
[42:52] the substance of things hoped for the
[42:54] evidence of things not saying that is
[42:56] the evidence that you have the new birth
[42:58] that is the evidence that Christ is
[43:00] living in you that is the evidence when
[43:02] when you lose a paycheck or lose a ring
[43:05] or whatever it is that there's something
[43:06] that thing will actually reach out and
[43:09] grab it and make it put it back there
[43:11] put that knife in your pocket it will
[43:13] actually it is our actual evidence but
[43:15] see there's God
[43:16] to be an evidence and this is the day in
[43:18] the hour that we're living in where when
[43:20] nobody really wants an evidence anymore
[43:22] we don't really want proof anymore
[43:24] I was thinking about about how so easily
[43:27] people are deceived by but all of these
[43:29] these telemarketers are whatever they'll
[43:31] call up and say your sir your computer
[43:33] is infected and they don't really we'll
[43:35] seek evidence to see if that person on
[43:39] talking to them on the phone is really
[43:41] knows what they're talking about my
[43:44] next-door neighbor did that here and
[43:47] he's lost his house now and I bless his
[43:49] heart and all kind of things that
[43:50] happened to him but somebody called up
[43:52] called him up and said you've got a
[43:53] computer virus and he didn't go through
[43:56] all the process didn't really think - I
[43:58] need to prove this out I need to prove
[44:00] out whether this person actually knows
[44:02] what they're talking about there's so
[44:03] many times you know people will go to
[44:05] churches and they won't actually prove
[44:06] out whether the pastor knows what
[44:09] they're talking about or not they won't
[44:11] actually prove out the thing you've got
[44:13] to prove out whether or not you know
[44:15] what the Bible is saying you've got to
[44:17] even prove out the Bible study the Bible
[44:20] to see whether the things that in this
[44:21] part child with that part proving out
[44:24] like the brains did study the message
[44:26] prove it out and it's so examine it for
[44:29] yourself so that you are thoroughly
[44:31] convinced I think so many people in the
[44:34] message today or around the message and
[44:36] maybe that's the wrong way to say it but
[44:39] I apologize if I offend anybody so many
[44:42] people around the message they then they
[44:44] don't look for the proof of what they
[44:46] believe they don't search out and get an
[44:48] evidence state they don't really search
[44:51] things out to see what they believe
[44:53] first Thessalonians 5 xx 5:21 says prove
[44:57] all things hold fast that which is good
[45:00] prove all things prove what you believe
[45:03] 1st John chapter 4 says believe beloved
[45:07] believe not every spirit but try the
[45:09] spirits whether they are of God because
[45:11] many false prophets are going out into
[45:13] the world
[45:14] hereby no you the Spirit of God every
[45:16] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[45:18] has come in the flesh in the flesh is of
[45:21] God so in other words prove things out
[45:23] don't just take it at face value but
[45:26] prove it out and
[45:28] you prove it out it and all aspects of
[45:31] your life prove out before you enter
[45:33] into a little young women and boys
[45:35] before you enter into an engagement with
[45:37] someone else you got to prove them out
[45:39] prove it whether they really are a
[45:42] genuine believer or not prove it like
[45:44] first John said prove all these things
[45:46] out to prove prove you won't you won't
[45:48] and I know a lot of these young people
[45:50] they're willing to proof that God is
[45:52] still alive and that's why so many times
[45:55] you you want to see the pillar of fire
[45:56] you want to experience an anointing you
[45:59] want to see these things you want to
[46:01] know whether whether you want to see the
[46:03] word interpreted you want to know
[46:05] whether God is really real
[46:09] but after God shows you the pillar of
[46:12] fire after I know some of the young
[46:16] people in here have seen the pillar of
[46:19] fire you have actually visually seen it
[46:22] and we've got the picture that hangs on
[46:25] our wall that shows that the pillar of
[46:26] fire was real and it vindicated the
[46:29] prophets message after you actually felt
[46:32] the anointing and you know that God
[46:33] cares about you after you've seen all
[46:36] these things and it's been proven to you
[46:38] the word has been explained to you from
[46:40] endian and even if you don't understand
[46:42] the whole thing from beginning in the
[46:44] end you can surely understand enough
[46:46] just to see that God loves you and that
[46:49] he is able to forgive you of your sins
[46:51] and and just the bare minimum another
[46:53] thing enough to prove to you that God is
[46:56] real and that this message is true
[46:58] enough to prove that you should put
[47:01] everything in God that that this is
[47:03] something worthwhile enough to put that
[47:06] to lay up this kind of thing as a
[47:08] treasure in heaven value this is this is
[47:13] worth valuing more than anything else in
[47:16] this world it's been proven out I'm skip
[47:25] over some of these just to save time
[47:28] excuse me I'm not trying to breathe hard
[47:34] see you invest in what you know is sound
[47:36] for the brand preach that message
[47:38] investment because yeah a businessman
[47:40] will not put all his money into a stock
[47:43] or something unless he had actually
[47:44] proven it out and he knew what he was
[47:46] getting into why would you invest any in
[47:48] the stock market or invest to anything
[47:50] in your business or invest why would you
[47:52] invest time in a church unless you were
[47:54] you were convinced that they were
[47:56] preaching the right gospel you had
[47:57] proven it out and you knew that it was
[47:59] the right thing you knew that it was
[48:01] sound brother Jesus talked about this in
[48:05] Luke chapter 14 and he said all these
[48:07] people giving excuses for why they
[48:09] couldn't come to the wedding supper
[48:11] knees he said he sent his servant as
[48:13] supper time to say that him that were
[48:14] bidden come for all things are now ready
[48:16] and they all were the one consent began
[48:19] to make excuse and they were all about
[48:21] proving things all about proving things
[48:23] out of order the first said to him I
[48:25] bought a piece of ground and I go and
[48:27] see it I pray that you have me excused I
[48:30] need to go prove it out after I've
[48:32] already bought it and another said I
[48:35] bought five yoke of oxen and I go to
[48:37] prove them after I bought them I go to
[48:40] prove them that's that's out of order
[48:42] you want to prove things first become
[48:46] convinced and so I encourage you examine
[48:50] the message and prove it out to see
[48:52] whether it's true or not and another
[48:55] said I'm married a wife and therefore I
[48:57] cannot come he got it all out of order
[48:59] but you see this message has been
[49:01] vindicated
[49:02] the Old Testament believers had to be
[49:05] proven
[49:06] you see Jesus had to be tried and proven
[49:08] he had to stand before Pilate where
[49:11] Pilate let's say I find no fault in this
[49:13] man
[49:13] your faith in the word must be tried and
[49:17] proven the preachers have to be tried
[49:20] and proven the word has to be proven do
[49:24] you know how the word is proven the word
[49:27] is proven by the word now y'all don't
[49:33] get tired of me now I know
[49:34] [Laughter]
[49:37] the harvest time brother branham said in
[49:39] 1964 he said watch now as we hurry up
[49:42] when the spirit of truth is come he will
[49:44] teach you all things whatever I taught
[49:45] you and so on it goes forth he says God
[49:48] has obligated to take care of his word
[49:50] down the bottom and so when they did
[49:52] this the word vindicates itself the word
[49:57] is what vindicates itself and the
[50:00] message identification he said that's
[50:02] what I want you to trust the merits of
[50:04] him and then how you know you're getting
[50:06] there is when every word is you
[50:09] punctuate it with an amen amen
[50:12] down to the read because it's the word
[50:15] itself trying to vindicate itself and if
[50:18] we deny that word how can it vindicate
[50:20] itself and then let's go on to the next
[50:23] message the the message you must be born
[50:25] again he says when you're born again God
[50:28] vindicates you that's how God vindicates
[50:32] to all of his nature what by their
[50:34] fruits that's the way I believe that's
[50:36] the message that was just playing before
[50:37] before I come out that's the way he
[50:39] vindicates his ministry that's right all
[50:41] of his servants are vindicated the same
[50:43] way he vindicates nature how do you know
[50:46] it's a peach tree because it brings
[50:48] peaches how do you know us an apple tree
[50:51] bear and apples see it's not enough just
[50:55] to understand that we need to be apple
[50:57] trees or peach trees or whatever we need
[51:00] to be the broad tree you must actually
[51:02] bear the fruit of the broad tree you
[51:05] must actually produce these things that
[51:07] we're talking about you must actually
[51:09] prove that you are who you say you are
[51:12] because if you are the word the word
[51:15] vindicates itself and if the word says
[51:18] that you will be a certain thing or do a
[51:21] certain thing act a certain way then
[51:23] when it's expressed through you it will
[51:25] vindicate that that is what it is how do
[51:29] you know us a Christian Christians
[51:32] Christian signs bear from it Christian
[51:35] life comes out of it how do you know
[51:37] he's a teacher the word comes from him
[51:39] how do you know he's a prophet the word
[51:42] comes through him
[51:43] bears record vindication it proves
[51:46] itself how does it become that
[51:48] it dies and becomes one that's right
[51:50] mm-hmm when we die have become a new
[51:54] creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with
[51:56] our calling we stay with our calling the
[51:59] fruits of the spirit follow us when we
[52:01] are his service when we are born again
[52:03] the fruits of Christ life follows us
[52:06] that's right how do you know as a peach
[52:09] tree it's got peaches how do you know
[52:12] he's a Christian he acts like Christ he
[52:15] walks like Christ he talks like Christ
[52:17] he lives like Christ above sin
[52:21] victorious what does he do say see what
[52:24] I done Christ didn't do that he gave all
[52:27] praise to the Father now let's do it
[52:29] let's just keep reading on let's go the
[52:31] next one is your life worthy of the
[52:33] gospel now the only way to live a life
[52:35] worthy is to let Christ and His Word
[52:38] which he is the word reflect itself so
[52:42] perfect in you till God vindicates what
[52:44] he said in the word yes because you see
[52:49] there's got to be an evidence there's
[52:51] got to be a proof of the thing let's see
[53:00] where I'm going appointment that I'm
[53:06] getting to is you need an evidence
[53:07] because we are being tried in a
[53:10] spiritual core of law we are being tried
[53:14] and I must skip down a little bit
[53:17] everybody doing all right don't get
[53:20] tired on me I'm not nervous
[53:22] so don't be nervous we're being tried in
[53:27] a spiritual court of law where where
[53:29] Satan is accusing us constantly he's
[53:32] accusing and and saying you did this and
[53:35] you did that but we've got to come to a
[53:37] place and what other this is a process
[53:39] that God has bringing us through where
[53:41] he can look at us and you can look at
[53:43] yourself and say I'm not guilty
[53:46] sin has been completely purged from me
[53:49] until you can look and you can see by
[53:51] the process of of trying and battling it
[53:54] out and dip it over and over and the mud
[53:56] seven times over
[53:58] / until God can look at you and you
[54:00] could look at yourself you can look at
[54:02] your flesh and see that it's been
[54:03] changed you can look at your experience
[54:06] and see that you've come through a baby
[54:08] form of justification all the way up to
[54:10] where the real you never did it in the
[54:12] first place but you see it in a
[54:15] courtroom there are players there's
[54:16] there's players and you've got you've
[54:18] got the plaintiff the accuser and that's
[54:20] the devil and the devil is constantly
[54:22] accusing you and saying you did this and
[54:24] you did that and what the devil does is
[54:26] he'll bring evidence he'll bring he'll
[54:28] bring to God he'll bring but before you
[54:30] to be your remembrance he'll say
[54:32] remember when you did this and remember
[54:34] when you did that and and he's
[54:36] constantly accusing you and you've
[54:38] gotten the defendant which is which is
[54:40] you whether you did or you didn't do it
[54:44] and you've got the judge God and you've
[54:47] got an attorney or an advocate to
[54:50] represent you and and I believe this is
[54:53] this is one of the most amazing benefits
[54:55] of being a Christian that when you begin
[54:57] to realize that place in the position
[54:59] that being born-again puts you in that
[55:02] you've gotten an attorney that
[55:03] represents you that is God himself so
[55:06] you see as you're being tried and as the
[55:09] devil brings his evidence to you you've
[55:11] got an attorney that that is speaking on
[55:15] your behalf and so that God is looking
[55:17] to you looking at you looking at the
[55:19] evidence through the blood so he doesn't
[55:21] even see it at all he can't see it we've
[55:24] got a we've got a mediator we've got a
[55:26] mediator to look at us even though the
[55:28] devil comes and he accuses us you're
[55:31] guilty you're guilty you did it you did
[55:33] it but when we come and we confess our
[55:36] sins and lay it all before God and say I
[55:38] God I'm sorry I repent and turn around
[55:41] and go the other way then God is looking
[55:43] at us through the shed blood of Christ
[55:45] through that sacrifice and he looks at
[55:48] it and says I can't even see it anymore
[55:49] it's gone it's not just forgiven but
[55:52] it's gone you see and and job chapter 33
[55:57] I know I'm throwing a lot at you but
[56:00] y'all just hang on just for a little bit
[56:01] I'm not gonna keep going on for much
[56:04] longer in job chapter 33 when the lie
[56:07] who comes on the scene he says behold I
[56:09] am according to thy wishing
[56:11] stet I also informed out of the clay in
[56:13] other words the lie who says I'm gonna
[56:14] speak to you on behalf of God and then
[56:17] the lie who begins to tell job after
[56:19] job's going through this great trial
[56:21] he's telling job that there is a there's
[56:24] somebody to speak on your behalf and if
[56:27] you can just catch this revelation it'll
[56:29] open up something to you
[56:30] and he said if there be a message or
[56:32] let's read job chapter 33 verse 23 to 31
[56:35] if there be a messenger with him an
[56:37] interpreter one among a thousand the
[56:39] shield under man is uprightness then he
[56:42] is gracious unto him and saith deliver
[56:44] him from going down to the pit I have
[56:47] found a ransom his flesh shall be
[56:51] fresher than a child that sounds like
[56:53] naman doesn't it he shall return to the
[56:55] days of his youth he shall pray unto God
[56:58] and He will be favorable unto him and he
[57:00] shall see his faith with joy for he will
[57:03] render unto man his righteousness he
[57:06] looketh under men and if any say I have
[57:08] sinned and perverted that which was
[57:10] right and it profited me not he will
[57:12] deliver his soul from going into the pit
[57:14] and his life shall see the light lo all
[57:17] these things worketh God oftentimes with
[57:20] a man to bring back his soul from the
[57:22] pit to be enlightened with the light of
[57:25] the living because we see when we come
[57:29] to God when we come to church a lot of
[57:31] times that we look it's like looking
[57:32] into the mirror of God's Word that we
[57:34] begin to come into a knowledge of our
[57:37] guilt that there's something wrong in
[57:40] our life and then we confess our wrong
[57:41] to God and and God has given us an
[57:44] advocate to speak on our behalf you see
[57:46] because first John says if we confess
[57:48] our sins he is faithful and just to
[57:51] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[57:54] from all unrighteousness and 1st John
[57:57] chapter 2 he said my little children
[57:59] these things write I unto you that ye
[58:02] sin not and if any man sin we have an
[58:04] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[58:07] the righteousness the righteous and you
[58:09] know what strange is that word advocate
[58:12] is the same word that is the same greek
[58:15] word that is used in the New Testament
[58:17] to say the word comforter if we look in
[58:22] the Bible says in John chapter 15 but
[58:24] when the comforter I just hit the wrong
[58:27] thing where did I go when the comforter
[58:37] has come whom I will send unto you from
[58:39] the father even the Spirit of Truth
[58:41] which proceedeth from the father he
[58:44] shall testify of me so now the comforter
[58:47] the Advocate is doing is the one doing
[58:49] the testifying of whether whether there
[58:52] is an issue or not but you see I think
[58:54] this is marvelous that God when he looks
[58:57] upon a believer that has confessed their
[59:00] sins there's no guilt anymore he can
[59:02] look on you and when you confess your
[59:04] sins
[59:05] God has given you his righteousness so
[59:08] he's looking at you through the price
[59:10] that he paid and he doesn't see anything
[59:12] and he wrote anything amiss anymore
[59:15] and I believe that's what the thing that
[59:18] we're coming to is where if we can just
[59:20] if we could just accept that I believe
[59:23] that God has paid the price for us and
[59:26] accept that God has has made us as
[59:28] righteous as he is that there's no more
[59:34] evidence of your sin and I'm just gonna
[59:38] read a few more quotes in Emma I'm a
[59:40] winder and the visible year of the Bride
[59:43] of Christ brother brother Branham said
[59:44] but the word justified is though you
[59:46] never done it
[59:47] it's not even regarded at all how is it
[59:51] done in God's book of the sea of
[59:52] forgetfulness your old book and marriage
[59:54] is divorced and dead it's not even in
[59:57] the memories of God you are justified
[59:59] therefore being justified it was accused
[1:00:02] you was accused you never done it in the
[1:00:06] first place
[1:00:07] the old union is in the sea of god's
[1:00:09] forgetfulness you wasn't married to it
[1:00:12] to begin with he the bridegroom bore
[1:00:14] your shame himself for you in your place
[1:00:16] he took your place for you were
[1:00:19] predestinated for him to be in his bride
[1:00:21] before the foundation of the world and
[1:00:23] in verse and paragraph 262 he said he
[1:00:26] the bridegroom took away your shame and
[1:00:29] put it in the sea of forgetfulness by
[1:00:32] the washing of the water of the word and
[1:00:34] the blood of life you are standing
[1:00:36] completely justified as though you never
[1:00:38] did it at the beginning this is my
[1:00:41] message to the church now as you as we
[1:00:43] go off the air just in a minute you are
[1:00:46] standing if you're standing on God's
[1:00:48] Word
[1:00:49] and with God's Word every Amen every jot
[1:00:51] and tittle you're standing complete
[1:00:54] justified you like you never did it in
[1:00:56] the first place but you see that's what
[1:01:00] God has done by bringing us through this
[1:01:02] process like Niemann dippin seven times
[1:01:04] over and over in the mud through all of
[1:01:07] the trials and all the accusations and
[1:01:10] all of the devil pointing his fingers
[1:01:12] what he's doing is he's taking our sin
[1:01:14] away he's bringing us through a process
[1:01:16] of complete Redemption until we can look
[1:01:19] into God's Word and and it goes back to
[1:01:22] us and we can recognize that the word is
[1:01:24] so vindicated in us do we never the real
[1:01:27] you never did it in the first place we
[1:01:30] can look back and say that I like
[1:01:33] brother Branham said to Charles and Ella
[1:01:35] Brown were or not real I didn't really
[1:01:37] come from them I really came from God
[1:01:40] I've been born from above and God has so
[1:01:44] justified me until I can take a body
[1:01:47] change there's nothing in this world
[1:01:48] that's holding me down you know I
[1:01:50] believe I'm gonna kind of skip over my
[1:01:53] notes but I believe when you can really
[1:01:54] begin to see that kind of forgiveness
[1:01:56] that God has forgiven you of all these
[1:01:59] weighty things that it will change your
[1:02:02] attitude to your brothers and sisters I
[1:02:04] believe this is what I believe that
[1:02:06] brotherly kindness is breaking forth in
[1:02:09] the bride right now something is
[1:02:10] happening what we're beginning to see
[1:02:13] the grace that God has shown to us
[1:02:15] didn't it wasn't the word of the Lord is
[1:02:16] a rouble grace grace grind to the
[1:02:18] headstone it's not by our power about
[1:02:21] Mike but by his grace that he's given us
[1:02:24] His grace why can't we give that same
[1:02:27] kind of grace that godly love to one
[1:02:30] another to forgive one another when we
[1:02:32] do wrong to one another to put our arms
[1:02:34] around one another and say I love you
[1:02:37] and godly Christ they love to love one
[1:02:40] another so much that we're willing to
[1:02:41] lay down our own life for one another
[1:02:43] that's that's the kind of love that I
[1:02:46] want to see I believe it's now being
[1:02:48] exhibited and the bride did to just say
[1:02:50] they say it and the purity of the gospel
[1:02:53] I forgive you I forgive you that the
[1:02:55] parents to say to they're killed or not
[1:02:57] forgive you if I've treated you wrong
[1:03:00] different and wives just say I forgive
[1:03:02] you of all the all the the mean words
[1:03:04] and all the fighting and the feud and
[1:03:06] everything it's time for us to just lay
[1:03:09] down all these weights that's so easily
[1:03:11] beset us and just say I forgive you and
[1:03:14] I'm going to close on this scripture in
[1:03:16] second Kings we're gonna go back to the
[1:03:18] story of name and as the musicians come
[1:03:19] his service came near to name an
[1:03:22] inspecting him and said my father if the
[1:03:25] Prophet had bid thee do some great thing
[1:03:28] that's what we think we think the
[1:03:30] message is some great unattainable thing
[1:03:33] instead of just the simplicity of the
[1:03:36] word of the hour being fulfilled in us
[1:03:38] wouldest thou not have done it how much
[1:03:40] rather than when he said to the wash and
[1:03:43] be clean
[1:03:43] how much rather when when I maybe say
[1:03:46] tonight
[1:03:47] how much while instead of doing just
[1:03:49] some great thing that we cook up in our
[1:03:51] mind sometimes why not just go to your
[1:03:53] brothers and sisters the other people in
[1:03:56] the church that maybe have offended you
[1:03:57] and done you wrong I just tell them tell
[1:04:00] them and godly love I forgive you I
[1:04:02] forgive you from that just like God has
[1:04:05] forgiven me God has forgiven me of so
[1:04:08] many things that I can look back in my
[1:04:09] life and say I wish I hadn't done that
[1:04:11] I've done wrong so many times I well I
[1:04:14] I've even told my children before I've
[1:04:17] gone up to their rooms and got down
[1:04:19] beside their bed and say I'm sorry for
[1:04:21] the way that I've treated you because I
[1:04:23] don't want to speak to my family harshly
[1:04:25] I don't want to speak to my children
[1:04:27] harshly or in a way that would cause him
[1:04:29] not to come to me with their problems
[1:04:31] and not to come to me would and tell me
[1:04:34] and get this seek advice listen I
[1:04:36] believe it's time for us to get serious
[1:04:39] with God and serious with one another
[1:04:41] and patch things up and get rid of all
[1:04:44] the bitterness and all the enmity and
[1:04:45] strife so that there's nothing weighing
[1:04:48] us down so that we can get out of here
[1:04:50] forgive my brothers and sisters and love
