========================================

i want to see you i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to say i want to see you to see you i am lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing glory holy holy [Applause] [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your [Music] holy holy [Music] i want to see you praise the lord do you believe that song you really want to see him lord turn around shake somebody's hand whether you realize it or not well fist bump whatever you want to do elbow bump we ain't gonna have to do that over in glory man hey man i can hear myself it's on the little button okay i'll turn it the other way then how's that you put a battery in i didn't touch it put no battery in it but i can hear myself it's all good how's everybody just hang on to that while i get your battery oh sure yeah it doesn't work without one but nobody said put one in it it's a pleasure to be here with you as always i want to thank brother samuel for allowing me to come by and visit with them family and for treating me so kindly and more family and well i feel like i am but uh we're all family amen and that's the reason why that i gave the title to the message this evening who are we amen do you know who you are come on well you can tell me your name and you can tell me where you were born and and you can tell me the day you were born and maybe the hour you were born and the sign you were born under the hospital you were born in and the state you were born in town you were born in but you still don't know who you are until god comes into your life when he comes into your life then he begins to tell you if you'll receive it who you are amen so let's just see how this works if you would with me i want you to turn to romans uh by the way i have to i know i wasn't i got to leave right after service because i got to drive nearly back to charlotte tonight to catch an airplane in the morning to go home so i want you to pray for me for traveling mercies and i'll be shaking hands or fist bumping her elbow whatever we're doing it right right on out the door so i don't want anybody to be upset that i didn't stick around in fellowship which doesn't seem like you're doing anyway so everything's good i asked the brother if he wanted me to preach with a mask on and he said nope couldn't hear you so i'm i'm pretty free right now how about romans chapter eight if you would i know it's a real familiar to everybody but i believe it kind of gives us a a lift an edge up verse 14 on uh who we are now of course god can tell you who you are every day but if you never believe what he tells you then you're never going to know who you are there's got to come a point in time where you begin to receive what god is telling you you've got to receive it into your heart and then you've got to start to believe it and once you begin to start to believe it then whoa the devil's going to get lit up he's not going to leave you alone he's going to try to make you change your mind and he has tactics for doing that so we'll start out sharing some of those before we get into the good part verse 14 of romans 8 is four as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are who are we the children of god and if children watch it now this is really going to tell us who we are it's going to tell us where we came from how we got there and where we're going then heirs heirs of god oh i like that and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may als be also glorified together so there is some suffering that comes with being an heir of god and joint heirs with christ but there's a purpose behind it for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [Laughter] oh look at where we're at right now you think you're suffering they're not worthy to be compared with the glory watch it now i'm going to throw your curveball which shall be revealed to us that's not what it says it doesn't say for us because of us it says in amen exactly i want everybody from in the sound of my voice to realize how important you really are to the economy of god don't let satan tell you nothing else and he's gonna try just don't receive it you're still with me for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature of creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creation or creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god paul's going somewhere now if you're old and broken down paul's going somewhere if you're young and you're wondering where you're going paul's going somewhere with this i like it for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now right amen and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves oh brother sister if you wasn't groaning six months ago you're groaning now waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body let's pray father we love you so much lord that we don't have the vocabulary we don't have the energy lord we don't have the ambition in this body to begin to be able to express it lord but you have a body waiting for us lord where the energy and the ambition and the expression will come through but father first there's something that needs to be done and lord i believe with all my heart by the signs of the time and by your word itself lord that we are now standing on the threshold each and every one of us lord of the most glorious time in the scriptures it don't look good right now we might not feel good right now lord we're being quarantined and put upon lord they're forcing us to do things that we don't believe we should have to do but father they haven't asked us yet what we believe we believe you we love you we give you all the honor and the glory and the praise father because of it in jesus christ's name and god's children said amen amen you may be seated now brothers and sisters i've been preaching on a series i've talked to brother wade and uh uh i talked to brother samuel brother samuel is preaching to you on the godhead you got to know the godhead because you got to know who you serve he's not two or three or five or ten gods he's not a lot of idols he's one god he's a jealous god and he'll have no other gods before him but he did decide on a plan whereby he would condense and down out of no beginning and no end right no sickness no time nothing but euphoria and pleasure and and and and and so forth and so on all the adjectives you could put to it and he said to himself i got to express my attributes it's got to be done i've got a plan to do it he said but it's going to require me to step out watch now of normal listen to the phrases now and it's going to be a new normal right [Laughter] because that's what they're putting on us right now but it's satan's eden that's impressing it see now remember satan can't be joy and peace and love and and long-suffering and happiness and patience and so forth so his kingdom is just the opposite it's hate it's bitterness fighting arguing disagreeing and it all ends up in death can you imagine a king over a kingdom and his responsibility as king is to see to it that all his conscious constituents die then he won't have a kingdom what kind of a king is that that's the devil he just doesn't know any better but god through his pleasure and good will has decided in the hour you and i live in to send us a prophet and i don't believe these are the words of william branham you can put that on there if you want to but i believe that the words of god through william branham believe that with all my heart and brothers and sisters i don't believe god wanted it to stop there with the prophet or i believe the prophet would still be with us what god intended was for every one of his attributes which would become his children heirs of god joint heirs with christ you see to begin to manifest his plan now i like to explain it like this i i told brother wade as he's preaching on the two spirits and that's very important i mention it all the time when i'm ministering because brothers and sisters we need to recognize our enemy now if you want to see your enemy don't you go looking around you just grab the mirror and take a peek we are our own worst enemy now there is a man on the inside who's going to have to fight the man on the outside what is he fighting for he's fighting for his own territory we are fighting the devil that took a perfectly good body and began to break it down and corrupt it he took he took the immortal and he began to bring it into mortality now god all along knew it was gonna happen and you might wonder why like a lot of people who aren't sure what they believe think of god and why is all this happening well i like to say it like this before there was a molecule before there was light or darkness probably we were told it was darkness god was alone with his thoughts you with me do you believe this it's what the prophet taught us and i believe it god was alone with his thoughts so in one sense he wasn't alone you know how it is when you feel all alone you're not really all alone but god was gonna give birth to himself and inside of him there were attributes that he just wanted to display and to manifest but in the world that our god lived in there was no sickness there was no need there was no want there was no poverty everything was perfect now how is a perfect god gonna develop a plan whereby he would have to come down and pay the price for imperfection when there was no imperfection i want you to know who you are i want you to know why you're here if you listen for a few minutes it might come to you think about it perfect god perfect place perfect peace perfect health there was nothing amiss does that sound good especially right now in 2020 amidst all the chaos that's going on in the world i hope everybody is not naive enough to think this is only happening in this country this is happening all over the world and there is a reason for it because satan is afraid what's he afraid of he's afraid of the manifestation of the sons of god why is he afraid of it because in genesis 1 26 7-8 he said god said let us make man brother wade kind of shared with me a little bit of the focus of of the messages he's been preaching on and it just tied right in with the thoughts i already had written down let us make man and lucifer's like yeah come on and he just come on let's do it and god said sorry pardon you're not in us let us make man now i could take hours and hours on this but i'm going to cut to the quick on that one that is he's still making man amen oh yeah did you realize that what when god said it brother bradham said it's as if it was a finished work i believe that with all my heart but guess what he also said it could take a billion years for it to come to pass because when god says something now he don't look over his shoulder hmm i wonder if it's going to come to pass or not he don't even it doesn't even cross his mind but this same god you and i serve i want to i want you to see how he got his plan in motion glory the way he got his plan in motion is god was alone with his attributes and guess who his attributes are his children so god was alone with the heirs of an inheritance that he was going to give let us make manny set praise the lord all of his attributes were just praising the lord and we didn't feel as if it was necessary when he made the statement like lucifer did that wow man we got to get in on this the way that his attributes viewed as the father was we're going to stand back and watch him do it huh that's what the bible teaches us let go and let god but if you let go far enough here's what'll begin to happen hmm god doesn't have anybody who's sick our father doesn't have anybody who's lost right could we be of service perhaps think about it you never were sick you're not lost you didn't have a need but a signal a thought came from that great source right we call our father amen and that signal was i have a plan i'm going to express myself i'm a savior i'm a healer i'm a provider and there was silence until one at least one of those attributes that was in god said i'll go yeah i don't know what it's like to be sick i don't know what it's like to have a need i don't know what it's like to be lost but if he needs somebody here am i lord send me i want you to see how the attributes of god work brothers and sisters because if we in fact are his children and he was going to employ this plan with his attributes then what do his attributes know they never had a beginning and they'll never have an end and if they lay their life down it can be picked up again if they get sick he's a healer if they get lost he's a founder if they have a need he's a provider you with me that's the god we serve and that's who we are we are his children and we have been given to understand that he won't lose one of us because all that the father has given me he said will come to me and i won't lose one amen are you with me do you believe that or are you on the fringe trying to still figure out how it's going to get done brothers and sisters if you can see the time we live in we're moving past that we're going to get to a time we're already to this part of the scripture where they would believe a lie and be damned by it why that's all about we're getting amen can you imagine it it's lie after lie after lie after lying after a while it's like i guess we're used to it now so we'll go along with it not the children of god all right still with me all right well let me turn the corner and let's see how we got a clock okay good because i'll i'll get lost you know a few years ago i couldn't even preach a couple hours at the at the watch night i'll keep you up till tomorrow morning if you'd like but brothers and sisters there's there's something happening to us there's a there's a transition taking place i've been preaching on a series of messages called the claim and i'm at the point in that mess in that series where it's a transfer right there's a transfer going on that's where we're at right now but i'd like to paint a small picture of how we got to this point and that is satan i want you to think about the day we live in satan is his tactic since the garden of eden was to interrupt excuse me hath not god's dead excuse me hath god not said listen listen careful watch the two spirits right hath god not sin think about it and he keeps repeating it and repeating it and repeating it and repeating it and after he thinks he's lulled you into uh yeah god said that yeah he throws he throws a word in there that don't belong think about it i mean we read in the bible here where it's just two or three sentences but i'm going to tell you something that serpent had been working on eve for quite some time you got to remember there was no clock before there's no calendar there was no months no days no years science has put that on it but up to that time who knows how long it was he couldn't get to adam we're told so he decided that he'd work on what he considered to be a weakness think about it do you know in the message marriage in divorce brother branham said satan designed a woman he couldn't create right rather wait he couldn't create and he kept moping around and moping around and moping around because he couldn't create and he couldn't make a man and he kept begging god said tell you what lucifer i'll grant you this i'm gonna let you design the woman i'm repeating what the prophet said you go to the marriage and divorce message and listen i'll let you design the woman and right there satan believed he had his way in i can't create her but i'll designer and i know a lot about anatomy i know a lot about botany i know a lot about biology i know a lot about reproduction i know a lot about and he said i'll make a woman and he didn't create her now he said but i'll design her and she'll have a flaw we're not speaking to you sisters you understand that we're talking about how god god didn't did does anybody in here think god designed something with the flaw then don't think so poorly of yourself yes because of the fall there's this exterior crust boy you want to talk about fall i can barely pick myself up but there's a man on the inside by a new birth that has been informed through the genetics of that new birth that we are so much more hey man than we know you know we had to bypass our theophany to get to this point god knew that and guess what that's not a problem because by the word of god and the receiving of the word of god you've been given to understand that you can make connection with that theophany anytime you want you're still with me so satan's interruption i've got this written down on my notes is the attempt in the garden of eden by satan was to interrupt the word of god now when god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness all right we're given to understand that at the end of the next verse that he made man both male and female is that right now now satan couldn't interrupt that part because he can't interrupt god but the attributes of god that let us make man in our image and after our likeness were given a mandate in order they were given a promise and that promise was to replenish and multiply and you see where satan got in he said i see my way in now i will inject myself between let us make man and the production of that spoken word all right think about think of where we're at right now we are doing everything we can to accomplish genesis 1 26 and 27 we want to be in the image and after the likeness of god come on amen let's just be honest but satan has injected himself he's interrupted the stream but god knew he was going to do it how did god know he was going to do it because of his foreknowledge but even better than that because god said hey you go ahead and design the woman you see because god could not be god could not be perfect could not be the god that we know that he is and make anything right that had a flaw but he had a right-hand man who he brought into existence what's the term they use that that that people like to use for the woman by product guess what lucifer is [Laughter] he's a by product because the product is of the original seed you're with me all right so satan has attempted to inject himself into god's word and the reason why i read romans 8 is because the gap between genesis 1 26 7 and between there and 28 is the manifestation of the sons of god you see what he did is he jumped in there and he injected himself before the sons of god could manifest themselves because in order to replenish and multiply you have to have an original is that right i love god's plan i love god's plan it comes down to something so simple that the wise and the prudent the highly academic and educated not speaking against your education that's not where we're at you know people misunderstand education you get an education so you can be better at what you're going to do whenever you get there to do it but you go into the educational system of the last century and this one and they are manipulating the minds of children and then they begin to manipulate the minds of young adults and then they begin to manipulate the minds of adults it ain't about learning it's about turning yeah you understand that and that's why i believe the prophet of god spoke against that because he understood the spirit on the system it's not the learning don't ever think that even the prophet of god said he didn't want anybody to be ignorant or dumb or that's not why he was saying it he understood the influence of another still with me so i i read this i wrote this down as i move forward satan's attempt to keep the sons of god to manifest and you know what the word manifest means to show up to appear to come into full existence see where he got in and now brothers and sisters i'm preaching on this for one reason because now we've come to the time where there's a corner has turned and satan now is up against something he's never come up against and that is a woman that he did not design amen [Laughter] he's come up against the bride of christ who was not something separate or different or a byproduct of the spirit of god but in fact it was the feminine part of god brother branham said in one place god don't run his business like we do he kept his feminine part to himself why because inside of that special place that you and i call the bride god kept the information that was necessary and needed to bring his plan full circle after he after he's already manifested himself as a healer and a savior and a provider and you go down the list of jehovah jairus and rafa's he said now it's time there's come a time when now i've got to close the gap i've got to push the devil out and here's what's fantastic god's using me and you to do it why because he wants us to know we're a part of the god that can do it it's nothing for you and i to sit back and say let god do it let god do it let god do it you know i come from the west to forgive me i know i'm on the stream everybody's preaching the return of william branham why because they can't seem to get past a point where they're not manifesting a part of the word that they can read and they can intellectually conceive but they just can't seem to get it done therefore we'll step back and we'll wait until the prophet comes to do it because we can't seem to manage it it's in the bride but you got to believe that it's in there right you've got to receive it and then you've got to put it into practice don't we live in a time when practice will make perfect do you know how important we are i i mean it don't shirk back you know how important we are everybody that's gone on before us who we who we understand is beyond the curtain of time and they don't sweat they don't have to take a shower and they don't eat and they don't get thirsty and they get to hug each other and an old precious brother even the prophet he's waiting on someone now brothers and sisters why can't it be or not it surely can be all you've got to do is make your calling and election sure now you say wait a minute brother election that's right that's predestination now i see right now that we don't got to do nothing because god's already done it for us i'll tell you what god done for us prophet of god said the devil voted for us god voted for us who are you voting for you see election now it's your choice he put you and me on free moral agency now when god says free moral agency he means it he didn't have to do like the israelite priest did after years went by of nonchalant and casual going into the holiest of holies he didn't have to tie a rope to us that's right because if we come from him amen we're going back to it brothers and sisters and we live in the hour right now where it's time for you and i to lay down the nonsense oh i don't mean you have to become some kind of religious zealot and get a soapbox and go down to gainesville and get on the street corner and start shouting no it's time for you and i to take the devil and put him where he belongs where does he belong not in us we've got to get him out and guess what god gave you and i the authority to do run him off amen how do you do it resist the devil and you don't even got to chase him he will flee that's where we're at brothers and sisters and what's going on in this day and age is exactly i'll read i'll read a quote to you brother you can bring up the one on page 104 paragraph 19 uh of adoption brother wade made fun of me for bringing my books i ain't got the hang of that tablet yet ain't got the hang of that their laptop but what i did tell him is who are we look did you realize that the prophet of god said that in the back of god's mind he kept the final secrets and brother branham used the word hid h i d guess where the word hid came from it came from the word hide now you're thinking you mean like hide and seek nope that's not where it came from it came from the word hide like as in leather skin you see god's secrets are being kept in you and i and the reason why some of us don't know who we are yet is because we're supposed to be tested and tried and proven and then you begin to release that like a time capsule you know the pill you take with the little colored grains in it and one goes off in one hour and one and two and one and three and one in five hours and then 12 hour relief well this is lifetime relief this is starting to go off in you and i and something is coming to us and this is what brother branham said tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now amen he's asking a question tell me when was there ever a time in the history those that manifest the time to deliver our nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been a manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to a manifestation of sons of god coming back see the connection coming back full circle all right and the spirit of god coming into these man so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ till it will join him and his church together do you realize brothers and sisters this is where we're at this is happening right now but the devil has to put a stop to it why because he realizes that once the claim is taken listen now about the pawn shop i'm just going to freelance from here on out because i'm getting i'm going to close brother branham talks about the pawn shop is that right brother branham talks about the boxcar everybody wants to tell you about the boxcar analogy but they never seem to get to the one paragraph in one of the places where brother branham says now it's a federal offense to break that seal that's where they stop right there fell a little offensive but brother bradham said but once it goes down the line there is a man who's qualified to break that seal who is that man it's the man who's been given the authority by the owner of the goods in the boxcar to crack it open now that was given temporarily to a man named william branham he cracked her open the seventh seal opened and then all of a sudden it was omitted why does it say that and there's people who argue the seven seals open the seven seals closed seven seals never open well i'm gonna tell you what the seven seal is closed to those who it's close to and the seventh seal is open to those who it is open to it's real simple if you're inside of that seal if you're part of that seal if that seal is you make up that part amen it's open but there's a lot more to just the opening of a seal than meets the eye i can okay that door right there brother wait is that door locked no it's open looks shut to me you with me to most people that door is closed but if you have pre-knowledge that that door is unlocked it's open amen looks close to me it's open because i happen to know it's unlocked look up the word brothers and sisters that's the way god's word is don't look at it at face value and go oh woe is me i can't see my way through this just believe it's unlocked to you and then approach that door and when you get there it'll open but so many people draw back i don't know it doesn't look that way to me it's all about your perspective it's what you believe you see not what you think you see you still with me so i could i i can see now that what's happening to us is that we've been convinced and persuaded over time through the nuances and and he's really good at his job [Laughter] that old devil and somebody might say well that that old devil he he he's not he hasn't been speaking to me do you realize that you yourself and me i'm gonna use me as an example so it don't hurt your feelings you're looking at three kinds of believers right here this old flesh can't believe the bible says no matter what it's it's enmity between god and then there's a spirit in between this flesh and my soul that is trying to make up its mind today i feel like it tomorrow i don't today i believe it tomorrow i don't this looks good that doesn't look good but then there's a soul in there who has to take complete of control that spirit and after a while the body ain't got no choice but to follow that's what happened with abraham how do you think he turned young yeah he went on a journey god said come on abraham leave everything follow me listen now come on watch the day we live in where are we going lord silence there was silence in heaven about the space of heaven where are we going lord you read your bible and you'll find out that abraham didn't get spoken to again by god till he got to a point that god wanted to speak to him again and abraham didn't even know the place but when he got there god spoke to him and he could look and say that's it and then god would say keep going now i told you not to take your father i told you not to take your nephew keep going think about it i want everybody to think abraham was nuts to anybody that didn't know how to be led by the spirit [Laughter] he was an heir of god joint heir of christ and he just walked he didn't sit around and mope he didn't cry he didn't pout he made a lot of mistakes along the way but not the kind that embarrassed god you understand brothers and sisters begin to differentiate between who you are and who the devil's trying to make you it's very very important but i'm going to finish with the pawn shop if you take something to the pawn shop and i know nobody in here has ever done that nobody's ever gotten that hard up nobody's ever had a need that great right but if you haven't you'll understand the pawn shop and how it operates right you need some money and you've got something of value and you go down there and they give you pennies on the dollar for its worth hoping you'll never come you'll make about 10 or 12 payments on it to try to keep it yours and then you'll fall out and they got lots of money for something they paid very little for and now they put it up for sale you understand it's a racket well we've been put in the pawn shop is that right by the fall in the garden of eden we all got some kind of slip saying you're on the shelf and you're waiting for somebody to come and redeem you and by the grace of god jesus christ paid the price for every one of us to get out of the pawn shop is that right the blood of christ is still there ready to make a redemption but what brother branham taught us was he just paid the price he didn't make the claim what is making the claim look at how close it is jesus paid the price so somebody went into the pawn shop and paid for that item to come back to its original owner but they never picked the item up and jesus christ paid it and he give each and every one of us a slip that says paige you are free but guess what hardly anybody went back into the pawn shop with the slip of paper and said i want what's mine amen that's making the claim you have got to make the claim today that what he paid for is not only yours but you as he paid the price for you and i to get out of the pawn shop but we're still in it because we have to take the price that was paid return to the scene of the crime and enforce it that's what god is expecting you and i to do in this day and no one else has been paul saw it could be done brother branham began the process but every one of us that's in this building and on this hookup tonight have the authority by god to take the claim and when you take the claim it's called transfer did you know that and i'm going to read this to you before i close now i'm going to fast forward to what to the lamb's book of life i'm going to fast forward to revelations 5. and a cry went out there's a book nobody can touch it nobody can open it i told you you and i are a book there's a book nobody can touch it nobody can open it nobody has access to it no man under the earth in the earth around the air no man is worthy right is that right amen and john began to weep brother branham said because he knew if somebody didn't step forward all creation was lost right what is creation our inheritance amen did you realize that that you're sitting on your inheritance you're walking on your inheritance i'm gonna go even further you're walking in your inheritance and it's in pretty bad shape why because there wasn't a place in time until god sent the message tell me my brothers tell me my sisters what time outside of this time see where we're at it's time to make the claim it's time to possess it's time to take back what's ours and it's done by a transfer we see it in revelations 3 21. i'm going to read that to you and then close i see it right here it's call i call it the royal grant to him that overcometh will i grant did you know what a grant was according to the dictionary a grant means to give back to transfer property by a deed are you going to the pawn shop with the deet you're going to the pawn shop to make the claim on the property that is all ready yours it's done by a transfer and i got to read the word take because what did the lamb do he took the book is that right out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne wait a minute brother chris i thought that jesus and god were one how could there be a god on the throne and a god in the lamb because he's omnipresent there's only one god but he's omnipresent amen and if you only realize brothers and sisters that you and i represent something greater in that land than you've ever realized how do we know that because our names are written in the lamb's book of life and he stood up to take that book and the word take i want you to get this means to transfer to oneself wait a minute he was taking that book for you and i oh i see what he was doing was he was enforcing god's word right and in that enforcement it was to transfer property listen now to oneself where are we who are we amen did you realize brothers and sisters by being the bride of christ that we are in him amen who's the lamb where are we we are in him that's the only reason you and i can stand today amongst all that's going on around us even in our own ranks is we've got to realize that a transfer by god's word is taking place how by believing every word when you believe every word then god is making a transfer listen now to himself and that's where you and i am come in please stand oh well i give you a little bit to go on a bite of a brownie that's all i can afford i like donuts too yeah my wife's probably tuning in but we love him so much more and and brothers and sisters i know it sounds fantastic but all you've got to do is put yourself in a state of meditation and want from the lord and begin to not listen to the messages hear them lots of people are listening to the messages but very few people are hearing them and once i want you to understand something when that when a light begins to come on in your soul and you go i see that oh i see that oh i see that guess what that is that is the book in the hand of god beginning to reveal itself so it's really coming to you god's spirit is releasing the information that he's been keeping for eons and eons and eons of time to the likes of you and me gloria let's pray father lord i wish i could express it better lord i wish i could tell it lord like and paint a picture like an artist father so it would be so unmistakable but i realized father that it does have to be by revelation and i pray father that you would help me lord as i visit with your children and and that and i'm at home lord that you would use me and men just like me lord to begin to break down father the bread of life and begin to deliver it lord to your children as they they would take it into themselves father and begin to have their eyes opened truly the the serpent was being truthful the prophet said when he told eve you'll be his gods but she went around it about it the wrong way lord but you've shown us the way you've shown us the truth you've shown us the life and father now it's been revealed to us the correct way to get back to where we should have been before the fall and that's by keeping all the word of god this bride will do it lord you've made the promise that she would you've made the challenge that she can father and she has decided that she can do it father it's all by your grace and your mercy it's not man's will it's not my will it's not our will lord it's god that showeth mercy father bless your children for their efforts i thank you for the healthy that are here lord keep them that way father i pray that you'd protect them by the blood of jesus christ from this evil that's befallen us today lord these plagues and viruses and whatnots and so forth father i pray father that that you'd give strength to your children you'd raise them up lord and let them be a beacon a lighthouse father to anybody who would be guided into that peaceful shore for your honor and your glory father we give you the praise for it in jesus name amen amen amen praise the lord all right you want me to sing amen jesus has a
