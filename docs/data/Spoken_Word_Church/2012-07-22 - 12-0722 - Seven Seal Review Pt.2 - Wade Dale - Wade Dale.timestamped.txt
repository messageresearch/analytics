[0:03] Timo falling in love and Lincoln
[0:08] County we have to handle things oursel
[0:11] here so our technician is
[0:15] star well Stars hadn't hit him yet but
[0:19] he's distracted distracted that's
[0:22] right he distracted yeah he'll look up
[0:25] and stars will hit him in the head one
[0:27] day in reality he'll s
[0:28] himid going to be too late yeah it's too
[0:31] already too late I think he already been
[0:33] hit between I yeah I think so cupid has
[0:36] just shot about a dozen at him and hit
[0:38] him in all 12 so but that's okay you
[0:41] know what so did we at one
[0:45] time most of you were not born married
[0:47] that's for sure so so we were searching
[0:52] and God was putting us all together
[0:54] wasn't he so we could come down here to
[0:57] realize why we're here
[1:00] in this
[1:02] age Revelations chapter 6 and I saw when
[1:06] the lamb opened one of the seal I heard
[1:08] of were a voice of Thunder one of the
[1:10] beasts saying come and see now we know
[1:13] what Beast that was we're going to just
[1:15] kind of review a little bit from last
[1:16] week that Beast was what a lion all
[1:19] right and I saw and behold a white horse
[1:22] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[1:23] crown was given unto him and he went
[1:25] forth conquering and to conquer he went
[1:28] out as a what a white righteous
[1:30] church under the under the um leadership
[1:35] of
[1:36] Satan he started a church but under the
[1:39] leadership of God God had already
[1:42] started a church in Acts 2 and 38 right
[1:46] and that church was a was a white
[1:48] righteous church for their time they had
[1:51] all the scriptures lined up right of
[1:52] course there wasn't any scriptures for
[1:53] them to read except the Old Testament
[1:55] Scrolls because they were writing the
[1:56] scriptures for the New Testament they
[1:58] were writing the New Testament that's
[2:00] why it had to be a white righteous
[2:01] Church in the first age cuz your uh
[2:05] Church a messenger was Paul and Paul was
[2:07] commission to write 80% of the old of
[2:11] the New Testament after the New Birth
[2:14] there in in the book of Acts so he had
[2:16] to be spot on he had to be
[2:19] right he couldn't be wrong now there was
[2:22] partial things that he didn't understand
[2:24] because even there was things that Peter
[2:26] didn't understand that Paul preached
[2:28] right Peter says Paul this thing hard to
[2:30] be understood but there was a white
[2:32] righteous word went out well then what
[2:34] happened was Satan just pulled under
[2:36] that and started riding in a spiritual
[2:40] form a
[2:43] saying that like uh what brother Bob was
[2:47] what was the what was that guy's name
[2:49] arimus arimus onesimus
[2:53] yeah he um remember he started that
[2:56] Jesus wasn't God he was a light Stu well
[2:58] see that was back under um polycarp and
[3:01] all them that was back in in the time
[3:03] that this all was formulating and then
[3:05] it goes up to 300 you know 325 ad the n
[3:09] and
[3:09] counsil um I'm reading a little book now
[3:12] about
[3:14] that how the Constantine and some of the
[3:16] popes came up they were vicious and vile
[3:18] people they
[3:19] weren't they weren't wonderful popes
[3:23] some of the popes had so many bastard
[3:25] children till they made a choir out of
[3:27] them so I mean I thought a pope wasn't
[3:29] supposed to have a life so you know back
[3:32] in the early time but see it was a it
[3:34] was a saying people what do you think
[3:36] about this or what do you think about
[3:37] this or what do you think about this and
[3:39] then it was a crown was given brother R
[3:42] said that was the false
[3:45] prophet what happened was he become a
[3:47] man he become a puddle then they you
[3:49] can't put a crown on a spirit so you got
[3:51] a crown a man right so he crowned his
[3:55] Doctrine was
[3:56] crowned right cuz it come forth from the
[3:59] Pope
[4:00] but now also the white righteous Church
[4:03] went through the first church
[4:05] age
[4:08] truly the right church right white
[4:11] church and the lion was the lion of the
[4:13] tribe of Judah so that covers your first
[4:15] three ages Paul irenius and Martin Great
[4:19] Men of Faith Great Men of the word great
[4:22] men that knew that the scripture said
[4:23] that water baptism was the name of the
[4:25] Lord Jesus Christ knew that that the U
[4:28] that the right uh wording is is go not
[4:31] God in three persons but one God with
[4:34] three manifestations see how close it is
[4:36] right real close
[4:38] right but they went down another group
[4:42] come up they went down another group
[4:43] come up into the fourth age which is
[4:48] truly a horrible
[4:51] age but it had to fulfill scripture so
[4:54] but let's go back here and cover
[4:57] that we're covering justification
[4:59] sanctification baptism holy ghost in our
[5:01] life because see I just told you that
[5:03] was history what I just told you it was
[5:06] all history that was something done back
[5:09] in the past they lived their life
[5:10] they're dead and gone well God didn't
[5:12] just cut that off and throw it off
[5:13] somewhere and say well I'm done with
[5:15] that one they fulfill this I'm just
[5:17] going to do something else no he comes
[5:19] and shows us that even in in all this
[5:22] that we are coming to a state of
[5:25] justification to where our sins are
[5:27] chopped off and God is beginning to deal
[5:30] with us right even in a sa cuz see the
[5:33] person of Jesus Christ is not inside you
[5:35] in the new birth until the baptism of
[5:37] the Holy Ghost still got the devil in
[5:40] you when this happen right but there's
[5:42] you go to church and they begin to make
[5:45] sayings they begin to say you need to
[5:48] read acts 238 you need to see this you
[5:51] need what it was a saying all right so a
[5:55] saying goes out at your justification
[5:57] you need to be born again okay and
[6:00] here's where you need to start your
[6:02] journey right here justification your
[6:04] past sins are chopped off M you're still
[6:06] a sinner right you got to repent for
[6:09] tomorrow because that same devil that
[6:10] made you do it yesterday is going to
[6:12] make you do it tomorrow that's right but
[6:13] you've come to a position though in the
[6:16] in in the word that somebody's speaking
[6:20] the word is going forth when it spoke to
[6:22] you it begins to Quicken
[6:25] things in Scripture that you've never
[6:27] seen before even in justification
[6:30] all right see the Bible says you know
[6:32] all Mysteries and not have
[6:35] this you're nothing that's right
[6:38] Mysteries oh serpent seed and all that
[6:40] yeah you can know every bit of that and
[6:42] not have the Holy Ghost that's right cuz
[6:44] the devil knows it you think the
[6:47] devil thinks it was an
[6:51] apple you think the devil believes in
[6:54] three
[6:56] Gods when it was just him and and him
[7:00] right
[7:01] mhm but he doesn't know the
[7:05] Revelation behind all that all right you
[7:08] don't think the devil knows that we're
[7:09] supposed to be baptized in the name of
[7:11] the Lord Jesus Christ he knows
[7:13] that right but he started a
[7:17] saying that moved over into this age
[7:19] where they started baptizing 606 ad they
[7:22] started they said that Jesus was the
[7:23] light substance of God and begin to
[7:25] baptize in the name of Father Son and
[7:27] Holy Ghost and brother Brown said father
[7:28] Son and Holy Ghost come from the pits of
[7:30] Hell the baptism right come from the
[7:33] pits of hell what it's started down here
[7:35] you say what about Luther and Wesley
[7:37] that's the mystery God wined at that
[7:39] that was partial understanding that's
[7:41] all they can understand so they baptized
[7:43] in the name father son Holy Ghost and
[7:44] and God said all right it's already out
[7:47] there all right but we got to develop
[7:50] from that okay this has got to go into
[7:52] the ground but this has got to start
[7:54] bringing it back up all right in the
[7:56] ages so justification first seal read
[8:00] the first seal and read it not as a
[8:03] white um devil riding off and not all
[8:07] just read it and look at your
[8:08] justification it's a journey here stands
[8:11] a lamb and there goes a white horse
[8:13] rider in opposition well don't you think
[8:16] God was got sure say here stands the
[8:18] lamb but God was already riding through
[8:20] this church these three Church agents
[8:22] with the real word of God that's right
[8:24] cuz remember Satan is always a copycat
[8:27] he never comes up with anything original
[8:30] right cuz he can't create right if he
[8:33] can create it' be God that's the only
[8:35] thing he can't do he can't create but he
[8:36] can pervert and make it look so close
[8:38] it's not the devil out here and Satan
[8:40] back here no they're so close right that
[8:43] it cance the very deceive the very elect
[8:45] all right to but in justification you
[8:47] can be deceived yes you're still
[8:51] deceived until that unclean Spirit goes
[8:54] out because it's the same Spirit unclean
[8:58] all right but you got we got to see that
[9:01] now they were in their time they were
[9:04] righteous okay but see this first three
[9:06] ages they were pure they didn't have
[9:07] Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism to
[9:09] fight you know they had little sayings
[9:11] like the like the man would go out you
[9:13] know that Jesus was a like substance of
[9:15] God well you know what that devil that
[9:17] man died 2,000 years ago that man you
[9:21] just said but that devil is riding right
[9:25] on end of the end time right now with
[9:26] the River Jordan doctrines and all that
[9:28] junk like that all right so the Devils
[9:30] don't die they just move around take a
[9:32] little different
[9:35] form all
[9:37] right now let's go to number two second
[9:43] seal and when he had opened the second
[9:44] seal I heard the second beast which was
[9:47] a what
[9:48] O say come and
[9:51] see and there went out another horse
[9:54] that was red same Rider different horse
[9:58] that was red and power was given look at
[10:01] all this power was
[10:03] given God allowed these things to happen
[10:06] power was given to him that set their
[10:08] own to take peace from the earth that
[10:10] they should kill one another and there
[10:11] was given unto him a great sword other
[10:15] words it goes from a saying to a
[10:18] deed Doctrine pretty much evolving
[10:21] remember the church ages lap over so
[10:23] that the seals one ends and the other
[10:25] one begins but if you put them in the
[10:26] church ages they got to laugh over with
[10:28] the ages all right so coming out of this
[10:30] third age going over into the fourth age
[10:33] which was what the Dark Ages Columba all
[10:36] right there
[10:39] was an eroding of the
[10:42] word the Catholic Church takes over and
[10:46] physically kill 68 million Christians
[10:49] red blood physical blood they shed
[10:51] physical blood right it says here do
[10:55] what take peace from the
[10:57] earth and that they should kill one
[11:00] another so so-called Christians killing
[11:03] real Christians killing one another
[11:06] right excuse me and there was given unto
[11:08] him a great sword or a great word was
[11:11] given to him what he become a viker he
[11:13] become a uh right in here is where the
[11:16] evil real evil part of the popes began
[11:19] in other words like I said having
[11:21] prostitutes and doing all these these
[11:23] things and the the communion with the
[11:25] dead and all the all the uh novenas and
[11:28] and and and you know one of the Pope
[11:31] said it's better that we kill them in
[11:33] the name of Christianity than for them
[11:35] to die in what we're calling now
[11:38] protestantism but it wasn't called
[11:40] protestantism until somebody named
[11:42] Martin Luther protested the Catholic
[11:44] church that's why it's called Protestant
[11:47] all right so in this age it was nothing
[11:49] more than if you said you were a
[11:50] Christian you denied the Catholic faith
[11:53] you died so there was a physical red
[11:55] blood went out through that age and
[11:57] killed 68 million people and brother
[12:00] Rand says Untold billions by their
[12:03] Doctrine all right so the doctrine is
[12:06] what
[12:07] killed worse than the physical killing
[12:10] is the doctrine that the people hold
[12:12] because what does that Doctrine do it
[12:13] goes from one over into another one from
[12:15] one right over into another one then
[12:17] that one takes it and goes over into
[12:18] another and that one takes it that's
[12:20] what happened here they had the pure
[12:21] unadulterated
[12:23] word right right but it be began to be
[12:27] eroded by this this
[12:30] because people started accepting it oh
[12:32] it's white it's righteous it's pure it's
[12:33] holy they're trying to do you know don't
[12:35] read the Bible we'll we'll interpret it
[12:37] for you and we'll you know we'll tell
[12:39] you when when God speaks and we'll tell
[12:41] you when he doesn't speak that's what a
[12:43] pope is right that's right he's the
[12:44] biker he's the one that speaks for God
[12:47] all
[12:48] right now that
[12:51] white came over into red because the
[12:54] people didn't pay
[12:55] attention Their Eyes Were blinded that's
[12:57] why they call us the dark AG ages it was
[13:00] a dark time for the Christian because
[13:02] they could only say I believe in Jesus
[13:04] Christ I believe he's the son of God and
[13:06] I don't believe in paying penants or or
[13:09] novenas or or any of that stuff I don't
[13:11] believe in any of
[13:13] that cuz remember if you'll watch you
[13:15] know watch the movie Martin Luther cuz
[13:17] you're going to see the end of this age
[13:20] appear That's right in the in the movie
[13:23] cuz remember the priest goes out and he
[13:24] goes in that square and he puts up he
[13:27] said okay if you sinned you need to pay
[13:30] so many pence and if you did this you so
[13:33] and it's just like a checklist it's like
[13:35] a it's like going to a a restaurant and
[13:37] ordering what you need you know it's
[13:40] this and this and this well that's what
[13:41] he
[13:42] posted see the people started paying the
[13:44] novion for him to
[13:47] intercede but then Martin Luther comes
[13:49] along and says
[13:50] Hey cuz he did it he craw remember in
[13:53] the movie he crawled all over the ground
[13:55] he laid on those rocks he stuck his face
[13:57] in the dirt he cried out to God why he
[14:00] had had so much of this indoctrination
[14:02] in him right until he was God was
[14:05] getting it out of him but he as a human
[14:07] was struggling with it he was a priest
[14:09] he loved the Catholic church but he saw
[14:12] when he read that scripture and I
[14:13] believe the light shined on that said
[14:15] the
[14:16] just shall live by faith not Penance not
[14:20] no venience not an intercessor not a not
[14:23] a a saint you got to pray to not that
[14:26] was the Revelation he had he didn't have
[14:27] a revelation that son the Holy Ghost
[14:29] wasn't baptism he didn't have a
[14:30] revelation that that there was one true
[14:32] and living God he was trinitarian he
[14:33] believed the you know he believed what
[14:35] the Catholics has said but God winked at
[14:38] that part of the ignorance of the man
[14:39] but he took that one
[14:42] scripture and Martin Luther comes out
[14:44] and remember he comes out in that square
[14:45] and he says no he said the just shall
[14:47] live by faith alone he said not by
[14:51] Penance not by works and then he goes
[14:53] out and starts to preach all right so
[14:55] what was he doing he was breaking the
[14:57] spell of this red horse ride
[15:00] over the people because remember these
[15:03] things are going to continue riding on
[15:04] they're riding in this age today that's
[15:06] right white righteous people they
[15:10] think
[15:12] breed
[15:14] blood brother said if you kill a man's
[15:16] influence you kill the man all right
[15:20] then black and then we get to the pale
[15:22] but let's stay right here for a second
[15:24] and finish here all right which also all
[15:27] this we were talking about back in the
[15:29] in the
[15:30] ages this was the longest age and they
[15:33] endured through that age and when they
[15:34] endured through that age they come out
[15:37] into the black horse which is going to
[15:39] be number five and six in your church
[15:42] ages but let's step back in number two
[15:45] and see that what does red always
[15:46] represent cleansing sanctification
[15:48] there's always a red heer there's always
[15:50] a red atonement there's always blood
[15:52] there's always something red and that
[15:55] Sanctified the people right the blood of
[15:58] the animals bulls and goats Sanctified
[16:01] the people it didn't give them the Holy
[16:02] Ghost right it Sanctified them because
[16:05] the blood I mean the life in that blood
[16:07] of the animal couldn't go over into the
[16:09] human being had to have a Kinsman all
[16:12] right that's what we're talking about in
[16:13] Revelations 5
[16:15] upstairs but right here is where the
[16:17] unclean Spirit goes
[16:19] out the unclean Spirit still unclean
[16:22] Spirit goes out of a
[16:24] man whatever you
[16:26] done you stop doing
[16:30] right here cursing drinking smoking
[16:32] gambling uh smoking all that they didn't
[16:35] go out here right God's not going to
[16:37] dwell in an unclean vessel if you're not
[16:39] clean here he's not going to put this in
[16:40] you that's
[16:42] right ain't that the truth that's what
[16:44] brother R said I'm bring you 100 quotes
[16:45] but you ought to be able to quote them
[16:47] yourself that's right right here's where
[16:48] the unclean Spirit goes out that's
[16:51] right that's where I stopped on my junk
[16:54] right here so God could give me this and
[16:58] and then I didn't do this anymore cuz it
[17:00] had been what eradicated
[17:04] red through
[17:06] red red his his covering his atonement
[17:11] through my red Sin makes a white sheet
[17:14] of paper that's just preach my sermon
[17:17] this afternoon all right
[17:20] sanctification is when the unclean
[17:21] Spirit goes out walketh in dry places
[17:23] seeketh rest and findeth none that
[17:26] dude's going to come back and bring
[17:27] seven religious just Devils with him not
[17:29] seven times drunk and you going to be a
[17:31] seven time worse drunk no you going to
[17:33] come
[17:35] church and right here is when your name
[17:37] goes on the book as a Believer that's
[17:39] what the prophet said your name goes on
[17:42] the book is a Believer at sanctification
[17:44] you have entered into a religious order
[17:47] well that's what they did in the
[17:49] Catholic Church they went into a
[17:50] religious order right all right so they
[17:53] went into that religious order riding
[17:56] this red horse which was false
[18:01] but
[18:02] now these people that gave their life
[18:04] for God they were Sanctified they were
[18:06] filled with the Holy Ghost for their age
[18:09] because that's the age that they live in
[18:11] that's what they accepted that's right
[18:14] we're not going to be that that's
[18:17] true the unclean Spirit went out of them
[18:20] and God comes in cuz if God doesn't come
[18:22] in right here he's just going to make
[18:24] you a religious devil all he's going to
[18:26] do all right but you know what
[18:28] somewhere it's going to manifest itself
[18:31] somewhere doesn't matter if it's now or
[18:33] 10 years from now or 2 years from now if
[18:35] you're just Sanctified somewhere you're
[18:37] either going to fall off the wagon or
[18:39] you're going to get born again one of
[18:40] the table all right cuz you can't stay
[18:42] right here if you stay right here guess
[18:44] what them seven buddies is going to make
[18:46] you feel at home that's true right
[18:48] that's right you going to sit right here
[18:50] and you're going to do what you're going
[18:51] to die
[18:53] spiritually not physically you going to
[18:55] die spiritually and that's going to be
[18:56] the worst Bible says she's dead while
[18:59] she liveth all right and that's the
[19:01] worst thing to have right here all right
[19:03] so Sanctified life that means everything
[19:05] goes out its sanctification and then if
[19:08] you fill it with the Holy Ghost then all
[19:09] that's
[19:11] gone I think we were talking about the
[19:13] other day you know I used to chew the
[19:14] back and and and dip snuff and stuff and
[19:18] you know it never bothered me never
[19:21] bothered me at all after after God took
[19:22] all that away from me they never B
[19:24] bothered me until just a few weeks ago
[19:26] somebody walked by smoking a cigarette
[19:28] and I hated them didn't I I hated
[19:31] cigarettes and I walked by and somebody
[19:33] a customer or something was smoking out
[19:35] th on it that smell pretty
[19:37] good but you know what cut the thing off
[19:41] walk on didn't want to didn't even it
[19:43] wasn't a desire but it was this old guy
[19:45] right here that's right that's right
[19:47] this old guy right here he was moving up
[19:49] just a little bit remember I told you I
[19:50] was going to say that touch word and and
[19:53] I believe at that time I was already
[19:54] filled with the Holy Ghost but there's
[19:55] times when you but God hit me me right
[19:58] here in the chest I believe the Holy
[19:59] Spirit
[20:02] went and I went you know just blowed a
[20:05] bunch of air out well that's all it was
[20:07] to begin with just a bunch of air but
[20:10] you know what if if you're truly
[20:11] Sanctified God will God will fill you
[20:15] with the Holy Ghost if you're truly
[20:17] Sanctified because you're cleaned and
[20:19] set aside for service not put in service
[20:22] see not put in service you set aside for
[20:25] service all right so there's your first
[20:27] two ages
[20:28] that we reviewed now let's go to three
[20:31] and four and then we'll probably jump
[20:34] into them real quick and then next
[20:36] Sunday uh we will back up and do just
[20:39] what we did just just now cuz I want to
[20:41] it's been three or four months I want
[20:43] you to get your mind back involved with
[20:45] the seals all right and then dad's
[20:47] fixing to start on them upstairs so you
[20:49] ought to be able to enter right in I
[20:52] like that kind of I like that kind of
[20:53] message and I like that kind of teaching
[20:55] and that kind of sermons I don't like
[20:57] the shotgun pastors shouldn't be
[21:00] shotguns I mean surely they got to
[21:02] direct to an issue sometime they got to
[21:04] go over here and get an issue and bring
[21:05] it over here but most of the time they
[21:07] need to be plowing right down through
[21:09] you know right down through and you can
[21:10] follow that's right you can follow
[21:12] everything that they're saying and you
[21:13] don't have to wonder well what's he
[21:15] saying over here now he's plowing right
[21:16] down the middle of the field now but
[21:18] like I said you have to pull over
[21:20] sometimes cuz you know you guys you guys
[21:22] operate to GI if there something in your
[21:24] life needs to be taken care
[21:27] of
[21:29] he'll pull it over here and but now
[21:31] he'll always come back and go down you
[21:32] know he always come back and go there's
[21:34] a visitor upstairs you watch dad today
[21:36] he'll he'll pull over here a little
[21:38] while and then he'll jump right back
[21:39] over here and go right right back down
[21:40] the line again so third age the third
[21:51] age or the third
[21:53] seal is age number five and six which is
[21:56] Luther and Wesley and and they were a
[21:59] man all right so let's read and when he
[22:02] had opened the third seal I heard the
[22:04] Beast say come and
[22:06] see all
[22:08] right what Beast was that
[22:11] man intelligence all right this is when
[22:14] everything happened this when everything
[22:16] exploded printing presses uh
[22:18] Transportation all that stuff was you
[22:21] know was coming in the intelligence of
[22:24] man they were coming out of the Dark
[22:25] Ages or if you want two kids in school
[22:28] we we heard it as Medieval
[22:32] Times m e i d e v i l medieval medieval
[22:36] time you know when he had the kns and
[22:37] all that's what we were coming out of
[22:39] right here coming out of the crossbags
[22:42] you know Constantine had this vision of
[22:43] a cross and he won all these battles
[22:46] well you know
[22:47] what that's what I was telling somebody
[22:49] the other
[22:51] day Satan is so close you can say well
[22:53] God answers my prayers God answers the
[22:56] prostitute's prayer
[23:00] so don't ever say I'm right because
[23:02] right don't ever say I'm right because
[23:06] no if your life's wrong your life's
[23:08] wrong period but don't say well I must
[23:11] be right because God God answer
[23:14] prostitutes Ain that what brother Brown
[23:16] said yes prostitute come across a
[23:18] platform she'll get her healing
[23:20] Christian won't get hers cuz she got all
[23:21] these things running around in their
[23:23] mind prostitute just walks up in says I
[23:25] believe what that man says and God says
[23:26] okay I'll take her faith
[23:29] right so let's don't let's don't get you
[23:31] know let's don't and I'm telling you
[23:33] this is very important because this is
[23:34] the this is the terrible place to stay
[23:37] is in sanctification cuz Satan will feel
[23:39] you so much full of himself till you'll
[23:41] think you're God and you're really not
[23:43] but somewhere down the line it will
[23:45] manifest itself all right but just be
[23:48] careful I have never put my experience
[23:52] on that God answered my prayer because
[23:53] of this right okay cuz remember
[23:58] the Bible says in Malachi 3 that if
[23:59] you'll pay your ti God will pour out a
[24:01] blessing you can't contain now he didn't
[24:03] say if you're my child or if you're a
[24:06] Christian I never depended on any of
[24:09] that external stuff to say I'm right the
[24:11] reason I'm right is is because what is
[24:14] in here Compares with that right not
[24:16] just degrees compares to it all
[24:19] right now the third
[24:22] state the third seal and when he had
[24:25] opened the third seal I heard the third
[24:26] Beast say come and see and I beheld in l
[24:28] a black horse and he that set on him had
[24:30] a pet balances in his hand and Heard a
[24:33] Voice in the midst of the four Beast say
[24:35] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[24:37] measures of barley for a penny say thou
[24:39] not hurt the oil and wine now remember
[24:41] brother ran went through that that's
[24:42] when that's kind of lapping back over
[24:45] cuz they see they're still charging from
[24:46] novans they never stopped that because
[24:48] Luther protested it they never stopped
[24:51] charging for indulgences and charging
[24:53] for purgatory and charging they they
[24:56] prayed John Kennedy out of purgatory
[24:58] they don't tell how many millions of
[24:59] dollars that the Catholic Church gave I
[25:01] mean the Kennedy family gave the
[25:03] Catholic church cuz they knew it was a
[25:06] womanizer and all those things they knew
[25:08] he wasn't a Christian man but they
[25:09] prayed him out of purgatory so see this
[25:11] this horse remember this horse is still
[25:14] riding whatever this horse did back in
[25:16] this age he's still doing now right not
[25:21] dead that's right the only time death
[25:24] destroyed a little bit later
[25:26] on but right here we see it was a black
[25:29] horse it was the intelligence of man it
[25:32] was a man age Luther and Wesley they
[25:34] were coming out of the Dark Ages coming
[25:36] over into the fifth and sixth Church age
[25:39] and you see the characteristics we don't
[25:41] have time to go through the church ages
[25:42] but they surely compare they don't
[25:44] parallel with each other they compare
[25:46] with each other cuz see you got one two
[25:47] and three in the first seal four in the
[25:50] second seal five and six and the third
[25:52] seal and seven and the fourth seal you
[25:54] can't put the church ages in the seals
[25:56] five six and seven cuz the bride takes a
[25:59] Rapture right here there's no more bride
[26:03] in the fifth and sixth seventh SE got it
[26:05] right we're here we receive the
[26:07] revelation of it the spiritual part of
[26:09] it then we drop back and go on Rapture
[26:13] but see this is rapturing Faith for all
[26:15] believers whose names are in the Lamb's
[26:18] Book of Life we're going to talk about
[26:20] that this afternoon cuz see I believe
[26:22] there's a book of
[26:23] books CU there's book inside the book
[26:26] right there's a lamp there's Eternal
[26:28] section but there's one section that's
[26:29] going to realize that this thing's going
[26:31] to be changed right here these people
[26:34] never got a body
[26:36] change they died in their group right
[26:41] right you say what about the Sabbath I
[26:42] thought we were at the end of the S
[26:44] Church age if we stay in sevens that's
[26:46] 49 77 49 we got to take a 50 brother BR
[26:49] preached us into eternity right in 1963
[26:52] he began to preach his message which was
[26:54] at the End of the Age all right
[26:56] everybody understand that we should
[26:57] because it's been talked to you for
[26:59] years but the Rapture definitely takes
[27:02] place on the four seal all right that's
[27:04] what makes people crazy CU they say oh
[27:06] you got five six and
[27:08] seven remember all this is to the Jews
[27:12] cuz we're already
[27:14] gone right now we know this happens now
[27:17] this and this and this cuz we can see it
[27:19] going through the ages but five six and
[27:22] seven physically happens over there five
[27:26] whoever died
[27:28] is giving eternal life right six is when
[27:31] the two prophets come and they open up
[27:32] and they have earthquakes and this and
[27:35] that and the other right then the Seven
[27:37] Seals when Christ comes back to pick
[27:38] them up but remember this is the secret
[27:41] catching away nobody knows about this
[27:43] one this is the one everybody misses
[27:46] they missed this coming the one that's
[27:48] here now see it's like a thief in a
[27:51] night it's not in the Eastern Skies with
[27:53] a split M if you see that that means
[27:55] he's coming back there in the battle of
[27:57] armag
[27:58] actually to fight for Israel Gentiles
[28:01] are done away with so the Gentile age
[28:03] ends right here that's the seven Church
[28:05] age is that too fast for you we may drop
[28:08] back a little bit okay but you got to
[28:11] remember that's
[28:12] Gentiles yes but we get the spiritual
[28:16] part the Jews get the natural part all
[28:19] right anywhere in Revelations from 41
[28:22] like daddy's talking about the bride
[28:23] goes up in 4:1 and she's not seen until
[28:27] revelation 19 but everything in between
[28:30] is exactly what you and I get as a
[28:32] spiritual walk until we do physically
[28:35] come R in Revelations 19 we'll read it
[28:37] this afternoon in Revelations 19 we
[28:39] physically come riding back with Jesus
[28:41] Christ in the Millennium on this Earth
[28:44] all this is already
[28:46] done everybody got
[28:48] that all right the Gentile Church age is
[28:50] over though when this age ends Gentile
[28:53] churches when the door of the Gentile
[28:55] age is closed God will anoint a church
[28:57] we're going to you be around for a
[28:58] little while but when God shuts the door
[29:00] that's it
[29:02] right got to hurry real quick so it's a
[29:05] black horse you say well how is this a
[29:07] type of the Holy Ghost and it's black
[29:09] well it means death right death that
[29:13] black horse means
[29:16] death it was charged in for things Penny
[29:18] see thou hurt not the oil and wine which
[29:20] is who you and I all right a black horse
[29:23] he had said only had a pair of balances
[29:25] in his hand you know know what happened
[29:26] with the natural
[29:28] but the black horse you got
[29:29] justification sanctification baptism of
[29:31] the Holy Ghost that's when you
[29:33] die you're
[29:35] dead you're exed out you're you are no
[29:39] more your own all
[29:42] right and then where is it at right here
[29:46] the intelligence of man that's where
[29:47] it's coming to the intelligence of man I
[29:49] said of man not of God it's intelligence
[29:51] of man because the intelligence of man
[29:53] they still baptized Father Son and Holy
[29:55] Ghost they still had trinitarian
[29:58] Doctrine they still thought it was an
[29:59] Apple so it was man's intelligence but
[30:01] God accepted that and said hey I've got
[30:03] to have that as a platform cuz like
[30:06] we'll see this afternoon like Dad made
[30:08] it today we got to realize that when
[30:10] that lamb takes a book in Revelations 5
[30:12] there had to be seven Church ages
[30:14] already finished cuz it had seven horns
[30:17] and seven eyes so he couldn't take the
[30:19] book in the first age he couldn't take
[30:20] the book in the third age he couldn't
[30:22] take the book in the seventh age as we
[30:24] see that book being taken it's at the
[30:26] end of that
[30:29] age that's why taking the book
[30:34] is he's putting our names right so
[30:38] everybody's name wasn't in that book
[30:40] till after the Sabbath Church all three
[30:43] see was not in that book in the first
[30:46] second third fourth let's clarify that
[30:48] it was in the book it just wasn't made
[30:50] known cuz the book was written for the
[30:51] foundation of the world we got to get
[30:54] and we got to get away from God doing
[30:56] this
[30:58] yeah right it's when you're made known
[31:00] it's when you become the book right cuz
[31:03] we'll get into that this afternoon
[31:04] because the you know the the even the
[31:06] sayings of man says I can read you like
[31:10] a your life is an
[31:13] open then who are you you're a book all
[31:17] right we can't do the fourth one we'll
[31:18] do the fourth one next time we got to
[31:20] keep up with our time Lord bless you
[31:22] bless read the read the four
[31:25] still or just read well yeah read
[31:29] actually come back and read the first
[31:30] but read them
[31:34] all no really honestly read the four
[31:37] seal because that kind of culminates
[31:39] everything before
