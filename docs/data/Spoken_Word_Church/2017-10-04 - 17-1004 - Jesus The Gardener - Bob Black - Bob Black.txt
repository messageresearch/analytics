just in the letter of the word but in the power and the demonstrations of spirit Oh God that's your quicken it to us we pray we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you mean I feel good already so this is just a little something I've been meditating on the just a little thing that the Lord put on my heart and maybe this might seem you know I believe so many for so many years it's so many have made the message kind of more way more complicated and mysterious that it needs to be so later tonight I just want to make take a little real simple little message maybe it seems simple and and just kind of talk on this thing that that was kind of that John chapter 20 tells us about so let's kind of read through this kind of a good amount of reading and then we'll kind of go into into the teaching tonight John chapter 20 verses 1 through 15 and it says the first day of the week come with Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre this you runneth and come with this Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved with and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth now that other disciple and came to the sepulchre so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the sepulchre and he's stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the sepulchre and see if the linen clothes a lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then when and also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain and they say under her woman why weepest ow she say it unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou shes supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now that might seem like a strange place to stop that scripture because you know you keep reading home down and and you keep following on to where Jesus turned to her and he said call her by name and she recognized his voice she didn't recognize the way he looked but she recognized that boy's but I want to stop on that little scripture she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him and and let's just kind of go back and look at what the set the scene of what's going on because we know that that what what was taking place here was they had the Jews and all the different ones that had advised the Pharisees and everything they were afraid that Jesus that they if the believers would come and take his body away and then it would they would have something to claim that Jesus had risen from the dead so they they took the tomb and the Romans they sealed that tomb with a Roman seal they put the seal on it so to make excuse me to make sure that nobody could tamper with that that he couldn't come out nobody could go in it was sealed it was closed off and it was a Roman seal on that thing and to top that all off they put guards in front of the tomb they put guards in front of it so that if anybody came around that nobody would there was nothing that they could do to get in or he could get out and you know that's kind of the theme I want to follow tonight that that's what the Roman the Roman system the Roman dogma all of that has kept the word of God sealed all through these years until the last day when we have the word is being made clear before since being made flesh it's being made manifest right in our midst so so they came to the Mary she got out real early in the morning when it was still dark and and you know she couldn't see it was in darkness the Sun had not come up yet and the first day of the week it says come with Mary Magdalene early early when it was yet dark under the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre she saw the stone taken away from the typical she saw the seals removed maybe that kind of kind of speaks to what's happening today where somebody could say to you the seals have been torn off the seals had been broken the seals have been removed but yet she didn't understand what it was and so just because this somebody says the seals have been has been removed somebody tells you that it's been removed it's got to be revealed to you personally it's got to be understood to you personally then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple which was John of course we know he's writing this book and so it's such meekness and such humility that he didn't want to say his own self and he's a sociopath of the Sepulchre so she said somebody somebody came and took him she doesn't not quite enough faith even to realize that God hasn't risen from the dead hear it he rose from the dead after all the things that he had spoke after all of the things that he had said yet still failing to grasp what was taking place they have taken the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the Sepulcher so they ran both together and the other disciple John is a little bit faster runner he here outran Peter and came first to the sepulchre and he they stooping down he looked in and he saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in so there's the evidence the linen clothes laying there all laid out and exactly the type of what God was gonna do he put the linen clothes a body over here and he put the head over here showing that there was something else yet to come some work that God was going to perform him then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the sepulchre and see if the linen clothes lie on the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together and a place by itself you see how perfect scripture here is it's so perfect that that these things that have been hidden for years now we can look at and see plainly a mystery that was hidden for thousands of years why would the scripture bother to say that the napkin was placed over to the side and that the linen clothes was right together at position just that way because when Jesus rose from the dead he knew exactly what was going to take place he knew exactly the the the order and the things that the scriptures will be fulfilled in and so he put it right there so that you could look back later on in Scripture and see that he put it the body and then the head coming then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home could you imagine after all this things that you've seen it he must be risen from the dead and then then they go home instead of linger and well if he's risen from the dead he's got to be around here somewhere he's got to be let's let's linger for a little bit and wait and see where he is but they went home but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and you know so many times in Scripture is a woman that's doing the act as Ruth and Boaz and Rebecca and all the ones down through Scripture that that are speaking and doing things and responding to the scripture and you would think well it's got to be a man it's got to be a man doing it but a woman that types the bride that types she's there waiting and watching and all down through skips you can follow these types of of how look at Eliezer he came with the water but he said Lord let her speak I'll say give me the water water water give me some water and let her if she's the right one then let her say I will give you water and you camels also and she spoke back there's something for the bride to do too you see the bride has to speak back it's got to be a call and a response that's even the way in computers you know the old old dial-up little phone it what did you did you and everything and then the server would respond and that's the way it is with computers that's the way it is with the spiritual to God calls and the bride has to speak back that's the same way it is in the natural it we don't want to get into carnal things but the bride has to speak back and all those kind of things that's you see and and but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and she went she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain one at the head and the other at the feet what what do you think that speaks of and you know we can we've we've come a long way many of us and and now we can begin to look into the scripture with new eyes and see all the different patterns that have been laid out I know that you know you might remember the last sermon I preached it was about looking at the pattern of doors and how the scripture has the pattern of doors all the way down through scriptures but now tonight I want to look at a different pattern that we'll get to in a second that you can see all the way down through the scripture and when the when you lay these patterns out then the scripture begins to come alive to you that's that's really I think what a teaching ministry has to do is to lay these patterns out so that you begin to say oh that's how it works oh that's how you're that's how you're born again oh that's how you grow and you begin to see these patterns laid out so the description becomes clear and that's how simple the gospel is because God follows these patterns over and over and over it's three three three seven seven seven over and over and over and there's tens and there's and 49s and and and this repeated over and over and over again because he knows that we need a repetition he knows that we needed to be repeated because we're simple and we need he came down from glory so that we could he condescended so that we could get it because he knows what we are we're just a little compared to his glory and majesty were just a little ass as compared to us and when she is and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus that's another thing I want to talk about tonight well how Jesus could be standing in your midst or let's say like that maybe not the person but the word could be standing there in your midst and you fail to recognize it the word is in our midst today the word is in the and the building's night I believe could we recognize the word and knew not that it was Jesus jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith on him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away where thou has laid him in other words not maybe not quite convinced that he was actually alive but tell me where you've taken him because even in death you know like those people when when brother Brandon passed away that I remember them telling testimonies of how they would they wanted to be close to him they would get on the plane and just hoping believing that he was gonna rise again and you can you imagine back then this must be how they must have felt even if this body is dead I want to be close to him because I loved him that much and so she said she thought that he was the gardener unless let's take a look at that little thought right there she thought that he was the gardener and of course they were in a garden they were in a garden and and just think about how apt that was for him to be to rise from the dead in a garden there in a garden where all the plants were coming up a seed had gone into the grass and a plant had risen from that seed and come to maturity and you could see the fruit maybe there would be fruit trees in that garden you could reach up and grab ahold of an apple or whatever in that garden where the the the joseph of arimathea is his rich tomb had been prepared and if you if we want to get do a little history they say that he made a lot of money shipping ten down from England or somewhere so he was very rich and he had set up his tomb in this garden and and think about how apt that was that that this man and I want to say I want to my contention tonight that this man is Jesus the gardener I want to preach on Jesus the gardener thirty two tonight because the Bible says that in the very beginning the Lord planted a garden eastward in Eden he planted a garden in that garden that brother brown talked about he he formed a man out of the dust of the earth and you could even say that that man was planted because he said he had his foot he formed him and his foot was like stuck in the dirt and then he he breathed the breath of life and he put a soul into him and then he put eternal life into that man and he began to he planted that man and he then he out of his rib he pulled the wife and just all down screws through scriptures you can see the type this pattern of God planting and if you look at all this economy of what took place down through the scripture you find Gardens this garden the original garden seeds vines trees rain wheat tears and little foxes grafting a husband man laborers and you all in this garden economy and if we go all the way back to this their very beginning of this garden economy that God planted he put a garden he planted a garden eastward in Eden and then he put this man and and out of his side took this this woman and he he was put every evening they would walk with him and he would plant within them his word as he would speak and I were getting a little bit deeper I guess you know sometimes you begin to speak along things like show me show me a quote for every little thing so just hang on they began to eat from the tree of life a tree of lies or two trees in the garden to treat a tree of knowledge of good and evil and a tree of life and see there's that type again of trees and planting and Gardens and seeds and they began to eat from that tree of life and you can see the Satan began to work his scheme his scheme is to keep the Word of God from being made manifest if he can get in there and make a blockade then that he's accomplished his purpose of course we know that he can never eat can never accomplish his purpose he's he's fulfilling God's plan even though he doesn't realize it he's buffeting you and buffeting the world and everything just to make sure that God's plan and purpose comes out exactly the way that he had tended but what Satan's scheme was was if he could just get in there because having a knowledge of the principles of life you see the principle what is the principle of life so a seed and that seed is gonna come up and before long you got what you planted that seed that's the principles of life so the devil knew if he could get in there and he could if he could plant his own little little idea or something then it would mess everything up so that's so that's he sold that hybrid seed that started out from beginning from the beginning there was those two those two lines going through now not so much natural now we're not getting into that we're talking spiritual this morning because no regardless of where your natural lineage come from regardless of where your natural history comes from the power of the blood is able to wash away all the spot of this world all the spiral is seeing everything so I'm not so much concerned about looking back through the natural lineage everything y'all believe in the power of the blood of Jesus Christ tonight y'all remember all those stories that brother been taught about how the bleach it'll blot out any city seen anything do you realize how powerful that is tonight and so when you come up with doctors and things that say well I don't know that these people could be saved I don't know if maybe there's something within your flesh that would prevent you from being saved you see then sees that see where where do you put the blood of Jesus then then you're forming a blockade you're doing exactly what the devil scheme is you're accepting the lie of the devil to put a blockade in front of the Word of God and then then the Word of God it has no power because there's a blockade you he can only move as far as you allow it and in your mind and your reason and all that all those things all those flus get stopped up and in the Word of God has no effect because it's got to be it's got to have a clear pathway to operate you see that's the way that it works and so so here we see that he he just on Easter morning he just the Romans that room and Dogma just let's put it that way so it's real clear the Roman doggin with a Roman system that had put him in the ground they they had sealed that grave and he just busted through that you could have put a concrete wall you could apply a concrete bunker in front of that and it would have been nothing to the power of Christ rising up and and that's what made it another thing that I would like to get across tonight is that where when the Son of Man is risen then death cannot stand in his presence the son of man rose because when Jesus was on earth wherever he went death could not stand in his presence he raised Lazarus he raised Jairus his daughter all the different ones when he came into their presence then death had to flee because the Son of Man was risen the Son of Man was on the scene and so that corn of wheat that had no hybrid that corn of wheat that quart of wheat that is the first thing I want to talk about that had to be planted it had to be planted so that you could have life to make a way for you to have life and that's maybe maybe another little doctrine that I want to attack tonight you know would you get up behind the pulpit you're really going to war really really at battle and so the another another little doctor that I want to attack tonight instead you had you had freedom you had liberty to receive the new birth even before Jesus died even you know brother brain I've told us all over and over and over that when they when they killed a lamb in the Old Testament the life of that lamb could not come back upon the believer the life could not come back it died there was no way it was no opening for the life of God to come back and dwell inside of the believer now they could have faith for a time and for a season they could believe you know David could believe and and and and and all the different ones samsoon could believe and had faith that he if he took up that jawbone of that donkey he could slay a thousand Philistines but it he to go off and and well let's me just be honest sleep with people women and and and David the same thing he'd go do different things within faith believing but he he would slip back there was no constant there was no anchor down on the inside because there was no way the way had not been made for God to get down on the inside of that believer and live for that believer that's Galatians 2:20 the faith the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God because when you get the new birth it's God living on the inside of you he's living for you as much as you will allow through your fruit through your free moral agency so the the reason that God had to send it that God had to come himself that quart of wheat with no Harvard at all I absolutely pure the reason that that corn of wheat had to be planted in the earth and go down into the ground and they come up on Easter morning was to make a way for you to make a to clear the way for you so let's look at that corner week just a little bit because you know when they failed and when he rose from the dead Mary failed to recognize who he was well on the road to Emmaus they failed to recognize who he was at all down through history men have failed to recognize the word when it's standing in their midst and they look back to bygone eras are they are they maybe he's coming someday is far away but they failed to recognize what God is doing right then and there in that hour and that day so I want to stress open your eyes to see it seems like yeah let's just go let's just kind of compare some of the ones through history that failed to recognize the Word of God for their day like like for example Cain now you know look at the aspects of Cain and what he was he was a real believer and fighting on the way up here my wife was reading to me out of the church age book and she read the quote where brother Branham was saying there was no difference between Cain and Abel except for one thing except for one thing except for the word except for the original seed there was no difference I think about that now they both went to church they're both sitting on the Pew so to speak there was there was no other difference beside then they broke if it wasn't a message church today and Cain and Abel were sitting there than what it would probably look like as they were both be rejoicing they would both be shouting they would both be saying their hallelujahs and saying that was a good sermon or maybe critiquing the minister or I you know did whatever things it would be going it would look like just any other message believer because it would look exactly the same but yeah one could not accept revelation and look look what came Dean now we know that we're talking about gardens and planting and seeds and everything Cain looked at it with a natural eyes he I'm gonna bring the fruit of the field do you see how close that is the fruit of the field the fruit from out there go pick up some stuff but Abel knew that God he had a revelation that God was trying to do something in people he had to redeem something and the original cause was the blood and so he took he went took a lamb the only way that he could have known to do that is bye-bye a revelation and that's there's a difference between believing and understanding either believeth in the earth my words and he that believeth in here my words in here with him that sent me there's a difference between believing and hearing you could say I believe but when you receive a new birth and God begins to open up your eyes and put the put the pattern together then you begin to understand and then everything begins to fall in place you could you could if the word were puzzle pieces you could throw it out on the floor and if you have a revelation you could pick it all up and know exactly where everything goes because you understand all the patterns all the puzzle pieces I know where everything is supposed to go but Cain did not have an understanding so he he went out and just by his own natural understanding picked up some flowers and some things like that which looks see how similar that is we're talking about seeds seek second Timothy 3:5 says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away like Balaam who liked religion but his doctrine was that we're all the same and don't matter what what church you go to or we're not so much interested in doctrine now let's not talk about doctrine because that we don't want to hurt nobody's feelings we don't want to step on nobody's toes but we're just all the same where everything is the same you know we it's God's Word that says we're different it's God's Word that says we're separated people would say is God's Word it says we're a special people that we're called out people we're not saying that about our own selves it's God's Word we're just quoting what God's Word what it says and so when Balaam said something elsea God never forgot that doctrine that doctrine of Balaam that we're just all the same don't worry about any differences you can marry one of these people with this all right if you yoke yourselves together with an unbeliever or whatever that's fine just go ahead and and don't worry so much about the doctrine and yet they felt see Cain failed to see the revelation that Abel had and Balaam failed to see the pillar of fire that was in Mose as camp he failed to recognize the word for their day the word for his day that it was enable it was down there and they camp with Moses that the that Ark of the Covenant had the tables of stone that was the revelation of Jesus Christ right down there in the camp they failed to see that and lie he had he had enough believing to know that the word was right but not enough to leave the world he wanted one foot in one foot out just like Judas half in and half out he wanted to be able to hold the money bag but yes say he was a believer at the same time and and you know the scripture says that the day the point where Judith Judas made his turning point was where that that little woman came and watched Jesus feet with the ointment and it says from that time he sought to betray him from that time when he was like how much money did you spend to put that on my on Jesus's feet if he had recognized the word for his day then he would have been glad to spend with what we know amounted to a whole year's worth of salary or what $20,000 in the days money it is that's how much money she spent on washing his feet and Judas got all upset about that because he didn't recognize the word for his day and see how how easy will say easy to fail to see to recognize the word for your day and to see what's happening to see what God is doing because you know even after Jesus rose and the disciples went forth preaching there were some that were still stuck they didn't quite understand what was taking place and they still they still look back at they wanted to follow a man and they found John the Baptist and they saw that he was they knew that he had preached even though he had got his head cut off and and Jesus had risen from the dead and they but they get they were still hanging on John the Baptist preached a message of repentance he mentioned he preached all of these things he came out just you know like brother Branham explained how it's so different from the way that they expected it that he came out not just opening up scripture so much but preaching on nature preaching preaching about serpents and things and about laying an axe to the root of the tree and just laying all those things out and and everybody it was so different and so amazing and it just caught the peoples of tension that so many they couldn't move on from that and let me clarify what I mean by move on because what time today's time it seems like so many I have there there they are still looking at the pillar fire still looking at the things that brother branham dear the stories that he did and ignoring the message that he brought and that's what I mean about not going on so they John John John's message if you would go back and read in the Bible he said there's one coming after me after me that I'm not even worthy to unloose the the buckle for me shoe I'm not even worried - do something like that but there's one coming after me now what came after brother branham not another messenger not it but the word that he preached would become lived in the people and would become a reality lifted from the pages of history and would become a reality and if you don't understand the message that's what you're felling to see so they so bad let's go back to John and the days of John that Paul went around and they let's look at it like a quill and Priscilla a man and his wife they met well I think it was Apollo's and and they began to speak to him and he it turns out he was he knew about John and he was a fire little preacher but yet he didn't know anything about Jesus you see he didn't know anything about the Son of Man he didn't know anything about the coming of the Son of Man but he knew that God had sent a forerunner he knew about the introducer he knew about the man that was going to introduce Jesus Christ but he didn't know anything about the coming of the Son of Man and then they introduced to him the Son of Man and they told to him about the scriptures and explained to him the Bible said and Apollo's hit the ground running and appalled even quoted him in conjunction with himself he said I have planted and Apollo's have watered now tell me then that nobody know there's no fivefold ministry that the church has messenger fulfilled everything how can you say that the church has messenger fulfilled everything that no nobody else has a right to preach when even back there in the beginning Apollo's was preaching right next to Paul that doesn't even make sense and you come up you come along all the way down through the seven churches and you got and you and you say that God changed his mind that he changed his pad and he changed his playing and all of sudden he's got it where it's just the Church agent messenger and nobody else can preach no one else can preach when it wasn't even same from the same for the beginning think about how that little that little Church the the Ephesian Church was started because who's that Paul and then they got to Ephesus and and they began to speak to a little small group of people that says it was only 12 men there there was only 12 men and they hadn't heard about Jesus yet they didn't know about the Son of Man all they would their their their their experience was based on the baptism of repentance that John preached and and so they knew about John they knew about the introducer but they didn't know they didn't have a revelation of the coming of the Son of Man and so he had to take it all the way up to today that I've already talked to you about but recognizing the day and your message recognizing what's happening today the messenger has come but let's hear the message let's feast on the word of life because the word has been planted but now it must be planted in you we're talking about planting and he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live because where the resurrection is you it takes you from death to life death cannot stand in the presence of the word I got it I gotta hit this real quick too cuz it's gonna tie in a little bit later because so we're talking about this corner wheat and this corner of wheat there was nothing hybrid in and Jesus Christ there was nothing contrary to the word in him he was absolutely perfect he was God manifest in play in flesh he wasn't some second person or anything like that he wasn't some some lower form that that something happened on the River Jordan or anything like that they made that caused him suddenly to become part of God but he was born God born Jehovah born and Mendel crying in the cradle and so after his life all through his life Satan is examining him examining him and I'm bringing this out because I want to hit this that he's examining you too he's examining his church the church he's examining the individual and he's examining he's examining the we plan and he wants to see if there's a way that he can inject himself in there and stop the word from becoming manifested I wonder if I was just meditating on this I wonder if we realize the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ you know sometimes it seems like many kind of things that get in their head and it's a philosophy that we're coming to church to learn a lot but there is power power in the Word of God there's power to take you like that Lily that brother Ben talked about to take you from the dirt and the dust and the mud and the dirt and take you from the sin of this world and transform you by the renewing of your minds so that you're not like the world anymore that's the power of Jesus Christ that I'm talking about power not just some philosophy or something like maybe Mohammed or Buddha my teach but its power that when the word of God becomes it when when it's revealed to you it's not just learning but it's the word being made manifest in your members and you become a part of that a part of Jesus Christ and so the devil wants to test the devil wants to look and see if there's a way that he can get you off of the word and I'm just kind of review some of these things that the ways that the devil tested Jesus because in Matthew 4 3 verses 3 to 11 he goes through the testing that Jesus endured after the River Jordan and it says and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God in other words I'm not deviating one bit from the world then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and into our hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone in other words let me maybe I'll let something miraculous happen and then everybody can look at you now think about this now this is how the devil will examine you and we know how that brother Brennan talked about how that the devil is watching you all of your life and he knows your weak points and you have to fortify yourself behind the Word of God and Jesus said unto Him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God again the devil took because he knew who he was what did brother Branham say when the bride begins to realize who she is she will be an invincible army again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them I said it's a throne II I'm all these things will I give thee as I will fall down and worship Me in other words I gave you a big place I give you I set you up real high now I he'll do that to you too he'll give you an offer he sure will then saith Jesus unto him get the hint Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him and so we know that that Jesus the corn of wheat that was planted in the earth he had to be planted to make a way and he was at before the planting was before he was buried in the earth he had to be examined by the devil he went through all the examining and then right there at the end Rome itself said Pilate said I I don't find any fault I find no fault so the devil's gonna examine he's got to examine the wheat plant and poked and prodded it because that's his job to poke and prod and see if he can find any loose parts and then the call of wheat was planted in the earth to make a way for you to be planted the Bible says all through the scripture it talks about you being planted in the Old Testament and then in the newest full field in the Old Testament it says Psalm 88 it says thou has brought a vine out of Egypt thou has cast out the heathen and planted it in Psalm 92 it says those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall bring forth fruit and old age they shall be fat and flourishing those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the horse and the courts of our God that planted in the house now you think about that planet your planet when you Jesus Peter told us the formula on the day of Pentecost when the bride tree was planted he told us the formula for the individual to be print planted because he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you'll receive the promise it promises to you if you'll just hang on and believe and wait until you begin to understand and the word begins to unfold it to you repent because you you've got to be planted you've got to die you've got the grounds got to be tilled up it's gotta be all tore up and everything looked like David David told us in the scriptures he said the God is a desiring somebody with a pure and a contrite heart a contrite heart that's all I don't want to be a sinner anymore and so when you've got to make sure that that your planning is successful by making sure that your ground is all tore up that all the green briars and the stickers and the thorns and the roots of bitterness and all that's all tore up so that the Holy Spirit can come down and quicken the word that you've heard make sure that seed is planted because you see God has put laborers in his vineyard but you also have a part to play in that and so many times I think we put we put all the emphasis on the laborers that they're not doing right there they're not treating me right and all that kind of stuff but we have a part to play we've got to make sure that I don't we've got to care for our own vineyard like the in Song of Solomon that the the the bride the type of the bride I forget her name there and it's only Solomon she had her own little vineyard to keep to keep the boxes out of to keep all the little things from from impeding and one of the little foxes this Satan's wily schemes his dog may encroach it in to keep the Word of God from being made manifest in their life and so even in the individual you see the seed is planted it's got to be kept trimmed and free of bugs that little bugs that will eat down that and and cause the word to not become it eats away at the leaves that eats away at the bark and it keeps it from keeps you from growing and and and the little tree it begins to grow up and sway it in the wind and every time little things come along every time the devil buffets you those roots just dig in deeper and and you just keep purging and and the laborers come along and they're trim the tree that cut off things that aren't supposed to be there there's a little maybe a little sucker limb that's just sucking all that all the juicers can't get the sucking all the SAP can't get the fruit to come the way it's supposed to so they they trim that away and make sure that the the tree is coming along exactly the way it can show that it was so that it can bear fruit because that's the goal the goal is to bear fruit and you know what this is behind it behind me here that's that's really your individual tree cause you're planning and then you begin to grow up it grows and grows and grows and you put out shoots and you put out tassels and then then the fruit begins to bear out all the way up the word is receiving you and and you were predestinated to fulfill his word in other words to stop the work of the devil you when you when God's Word is tuefel feeling you it ceases the devil can't do nothing to you and you know brother Branham said you can get so close to God until the devil doesn't know what to do he doesn't know what to do with you and what's happening is you're growing from the earth like that little Lily you're growing out of the earth growing away from the carnal desires and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life growing from all of that stuff up higher and higher and higher just like just like when Judas keys escape from the earth he he came from down and the bowels of the earth from Hell and he walked around and then he ascended on high you're climbing higher and higher and higher up jacob's ladder until you come to what the revelation of who Jesus is and who you are which is what the fivefold ministry was giving forward right what is the fivefold ministry they're going around with a little little bug sprayer spraying that this the sprayer I hope that sounds alright sprayer keeping the bugs from eating the plant so that you can grow into maturity that's right spread those bugs because like on the day of Pentecost brother there's a quote I was going to read where brother I'm saying the restoration of the bride tree he said and then the prostate he said he talking about the day of Pentecost but there came from Hibbing the sound of a rushing mighty wind that filled all the house where they were sitting that's right coming down through them leaves own trees poured over the bark see there's that pattern again of these trees on the day of Pentecost like Ezekiel said I see tree I saw trees walking trees because what it is that you're you when that when they're holy goes quickens a word and you then that his life is resurrected in you his life brings you from death and then you begin to eat on the doctrine you begin to eat on the word and you grow bark because the bark is the word and it allows that life to just cut the bark is that doctrine and that allows the it's a conduit like a bark on a tree for the life to come through and you begin to put forth leaves like leaves of joy leaves of that that Pentecostal experience the real Pentecostal experience of joy and you know I bring a joy what brings joy is when you're taken from the dust to life when you're delivered when you experience the delivering power of Jesus Christ that'll give you joy not not put on not just dancing around like like Paul said bodily exercise profiteth little popping around no prophet a prophet too much but when it's something that's power and from the inside and and moving you because you know you have experienced the grace of Jesus Christ to take you from this to this then that gives you real joy and I you know I think that a lot of times it seems like we just let me say let me see how I can say this right you know the young people I believe that they they fail to see sometimes that the message is more than just about learning and studying everything it's it's about a real joy and it will bring joy if you get into the word and study the word and understand it it's more than just just arguments and debates and and like in the old days of bringing weapons to ministers meetings and stuff and getting all up in here everybody's face but there's a joy out real a real true joy to being a message of believer I thank God that you're not I believe here I've got that joy in my heart tonight it's pulsating it's pulsating still it's a real true joy that keeps powering on powering on and if you don't have that joy tonight then seek God until you get it because there's a real genuine joy to serving God it's not just rules and regulations and beating one go ahead and trying to get one another to do things that we think they should but there's a joy to serving God there's a joy to loving one another and a joy to brotherly kindness that only comes from the true revelation of Jesus Christ and you keep going up up up until your bearing forth fruit the nine fruits of the spirit love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such I really like that part I guess such there is no law how can you hold anything against hold anything against the elect and what is the fruit the fruit now we know an apple it's the structure around the seed right but that's not so in the we plant and the we plant the fruit and the seed is the same thing so when you bear forth fruit it's gets taken back to the original it's going running all the way back to the original like what brother Branham said he said when the new priest was ordained they they get it they had a right to go back in there and scoop out a big old handful of that matter of the original manner that the original the original doctrine the original word that's what we want to run it back to the original thing and that's what that's what God has been restoring back all down through the seven churches the restoration of the word restoring back that broad tree that was planted on the day of Pentecost and that's the third thing and I want to talk about tonight and you can probably guess I'm gonna wind up in a little bit because I'm running out of trees we talked about we talked about the corn of wheat that was planted in the ground we talked about the individual but there's also the broad tree and you know that's almost a strange thing to explain because you yourself are tree Christ is the tree is the tree of life but when you are planted in righteousness you become part of that tree and it is growing up as well and that's what can be a little bit confusing to say well you know there's a doctrine that says well if I was born again in this Ephesus church age then it's only only as far as up as I could go his face but see it doesn't quite work like that because jesus said or grandma taught us that on the day pentecost's that they had all of these virtues all of them even though they were in the first churches now the ones that on the street that heard the preaching of the word rot off and hadn't had all that teaching for three and a half years they had a little bit too growing to go but see how there's two things happening there there's the planning of the individual and then there's the planning a growing of the broad tree and when it all comes to fruition in this last day it all comes to a head then something has to happen because if this is if if this is the son of man with a head and a body and you take that son of man and that was back there before the foundation of the world and put him in flesh so that he's restored back again walking around in the people not just one individual boy in the people that have heard the message and I believe the message then death cannot stand before the Son of man death cannot stand something's got to happen and if the son of man has made manifest again then the dead in Christ will have to rise they cannot stay in the ground something's going to happen either part brother Brown told us when you get born again or whatever age you're in or you you fall into the rhythm of the word the rhythm of the word for your day and I believe the rhythm of the word for our day is not just preaching on piddly things in the past but - preaching the deep things the mysteries of God that I've been hidden through the father's from the foundation of the world and are now being made manifest that God is under here he revealed himself in Christ that now he's revealing himself in the bride tree but also in the individual he's revealing himself in you and I you have to come from a baby form all the way up to a full a full stature even as the bride tree is growing up my goodness I ain't read any of my quotes I hope I'm not shouting there y'all I feel like I am a little bit but look how see Satan's scheme at work with the bride tree all down through the seven churches you can see Satan Satan's scheme was to to seal off the Word of God so that you couldn't get to it to put a barrier in there so that it couldn't be manifest and of course we know that that was all working in God's God's will his perfect plan because there are things that can be discussed now that could not be said then there's a time and a season for all things for example if he preached if the things that are being preached now were preached back then then you wouldn't have had an opportunity to be born but God had to wait for you to come into manifestation he had to wait for you to be here so that the word this word could be preached and then the whole plan the whole tree could be finished and you see you see Satan's scheme at work is as each of these Warriors went went to battle against the doctrine that Satan was was throwing out their ireenie us he was he did battlers only a few writings of him but he did battle against that idea that Jesus was not the Son of God he did he did battle against that idea that he was a separate person and he wrote against not Gnosticism the idea that a lower form of God came was like a creation the Demiurge they called it came out and that's the same doctrine that's being preached today on the the River Jordan doctor and that's the same thing you could trace it all the way back that's what I read his word against he had a story that he told a Polycarp or John John the Revelator in in a bathhouse and this guy named Cerritos that was teaching this this new stur sysm came in there and John said I don't even want to be in the same place with him lest the house fall down that's how much he disagreed with that doctrine you know I I wonder what it what would we do if the ones that were in that first church age came back and preached behind that pulpit what if they were standing here preaching Tom melius and and Alexander and philetus well and the things that they preached against you know Alexander and philetus you could say all they disagreed was was that the resurrection and was already passed that's all they disagreed with would you be alright with that today would you be fine with somebody disagree disagree in with the word like that today it seems like that's fine today but there's gonna be a people a real wheat germ that will not be fine with that they're gonna stand for the word and they're gonna say that ain't what Paul preached and if nobody else will I'll say it if nobody I'll tell you what if nobody ever invites me anywhere to preach if nobody if I don't have anywhere to preach but to the fencepost behind my house then let me sing the truth because like brother Brennan said I'd rather feast on own branch of water and soda crackers then stand for a lot of tommyrot that's being preached today so I Rania's stood for the truth and on down more and stood for the truth and you know you get in your head that that the devil aid the word down so much let my voice hear then a lot of these brothers barely had anything to preach but look Marta Jesus brother Brennan said Martin was the greatest since Jesus Christ to ever live he was a like that God shown that to shine light to call the people that were leaving to open the door for them to come out from the doctrines of denominationalism that have come up to come out from all that stuff and enter into the open door that's prepared for you and look at Colombo who was Martin's nephew he write all all the way up to Colombo he was baptizing in Jesus name is what the church age book says he was baptizing in Jesus name and still preaching one God but then at Nicaea that they got the the word began to that the devil began to get in there and slide his little ideas in there that maybe Jesus wasn't the same as God and he was a different person and it began to all these doctors began to encroach until they even lost their that's a great meaning of communion they lost the true baptism all these things but the Bible says in Joel chapter 2 that I will restore say I will restore what the the pommel worm and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the locusts all these bugs all these bugs that have been eating away at the bride tree all this time you know they're eating away at the individual - it's false doctrine it's incorrect teaching and God has sent a five-four ministry gifts into the church to spray just spray down the bugs and get all that stuff off to cut away at the tree to cut on to trim them and prune and get everything straightened up so that so that God will have a perfect bride a true bride that's standing for the Word of God who doesn't feel the same way who doesn't fail to believe all the word all of the word do you believe that in this day God's gonna have a bride that believes all of the word do you know what that means that means that she's not gonna say I don't know why we got understanding on 70 weeks I mean she's not gonna say I don't know why we got to understand Christ mystery God reveal that means she's not gonna say I ain't got time to read marriage the divorce that means she's gonna be she's gonna be in the tape she's going to be in the message all the way because she's called the revelation she's caught the vision of what that means to get in the word and to accept the word accept the messenger certainly we believe and we're thankful that God sent a messenger but he sent a message he preached the message and he said I must decrease decrease so that he can increase what's increasing the Word of God in the people the people are catching the message and it's getting down to the wire now it's getting down to where you know brother but that's one one quote I have in my stack somewhere where brother brand said get in the wheat get in there because time is running out I'm gonna wind up in just a second here but you know what it is it's harvest time because we've come down to where you know the Bible says that when two there was two sewers that went out a sower went forth to sow and then when men were sleeping not watching then another sower went out and he began to sew tears and it wasn't till after the fruit the the real wheat began to bear forth fruit that they noticed that there were tears in there and that how it always is the the impersonator sees the real true and they want to impersonate that now that may be that I hip you understand the seals a little bit because first God does something and then the devil impersonates it that's always what happens and and and in in the church in the individual everything God does something in somebody's life and somebody wants to impersonate now don't be an impersonator because there's a way there's a way back there's a way back for Cain if he would have accepted it boy that's a controversial statement but the power of Jesus Christ is enough to purge any sin there's a way back for a tear he can take a cook a bird and turn it into a wheat plant that's the power of Jesus Christ I'm telling my power not some kind of idea but the real power I hope that was well-received all right because when when the real wheat term when the real wheat is made manifest again all the way from Lutheran Wesley all the way up from Pentecost then it's it's gonna receive the word it's gonna manifest the word there's not gonna be an impersonation to it it's gonna be the real genuine and there's got to be in this day the wheat germ made manifest just like that corn of wheat there fell into the ground where there ain't no hybridization to it you know almost makes you say like they said when Jesus said I'm rich man candy and they're entering heaven how is it possible but jesus said with God all things are possible amen and he said I am the resurrection and the life you know brother Branham back in the in the 30s or whatever he had those seven visions about all the things that were gonna take place and you can see all look around and see all the things that are happening he talked about how Mussolini would come up on the scene and he said if Mussolini ever goes toward Ethiopia marked this down there never peace till Jesus Christ comes and then he had that that vision of of Hitler and and fascism and Nazism come and then they combined up into communism and then he had the fourth vision of the technological advancements on how there'd be a little car and these are all things that they're poking fun at on the owner the internet and things there's no car that drives itself oh yes there are that's plenty of cars all you have to do is go to google and type in an egg-shaped car and you'll get like five pages of egg-shaped cards come back that are all that drive themselves and on down into the he began to talk about the the decay the immorality and then that powerful woman that will rise up and all these things that would that would transpire as the wheat is maturing all these because the earth is quaking the nations are quaking there's something's awakening something's happening the signs that the prophets foretold are here among us and we can see that wheat being full the week coming to maturity so if I could leave you with anything it would be run as fast as you can and give everything you have to getting into that wheat plant because when the wheat matures and the door is shut something's gonna happen I know I'm about to run out of time no hang on just for a few more minutes all right and we talked about how Jesus was tested we talked about how Satan's tests he's got to test that corner Weaver and he tests the bride tree he's testing the bride tree as a whole and he's testing the individual tree the individual he come to you and do these things that brother Branham talked about in the message the harvest time oh how about that talking about the harvest and you know he talked about how there's three things that ministers have to watch out money women in popularity but but you know I think these kind of art maybe another class a different class these things that we looked at in the scripture the now that the devil came and tested Jesus so let's see how the devil will tempt the individual first he tempts you like like he tempted Jesus to get away from the bread of life to tempt you away from the word that to get away from the idea the the revelation that man shall live by every word because it's not what the seminary says or what somebody else said or what Miss Jones thinks about it or what doctors showing so think about it now hang on now because I know I won't be hitting on now because you know there's so many say I heard such-and-such to preach this on the internet now what has that got to do with anything when you start talking about when you begin to look at personalities instead of the word then you're getting off you're getting off the beaten path now this is only the first thing that the devil does he says will you take the word or will you take what just somebody said somebody somebody famous somebody reputable in the message drops some some statement that is miles off from the word and you know us off the word you know but yet this a personality is somebody that seems really got to be enlightened and you know I I got caught up in that one when I was an early Christian I remember sitting in church one day and brother Wade was there and this brother that I had mired so much he he dropped this this bomb he was preaching behind the Pope and he said Jesus was not God until the river Jordan and I I think I cried for like a week I cried and I pray God if you just speak to this brother and open up his eyes but look you can't take something from somebody just because they're a personality that's what the devil will lay right in front of you and say well this seems like he's he sweats a lot and he's preaching he's flinging sweat everywhere and he he needs all of these things after he prayed and he's a gator but or whatever but that don't mean nothing if it's contrary to the word you [Applause] know the next thing the devil do is he'll come to you and he'll do like he did to Jesus he'll say cast yourself down now he that's what he told Jesus because Jesus could cast himself down but he'll give you a little bit something different something he'll give you a supernatural offer he'll give you a dream or vision he'll give you you know that's how that's one of the devil's cheapest ways to get in and mess up everything is to give somebody a dream and they'll say I know this has got to be from the Lord and he'll lay a vision out there but it says contrary to the word is anything but they want to be special they want to be supernatural they want to be an elite person in the church and so the devil will give that person a dream or a vision and I had well let's get let's get personal for a little bit I'm debating let's say somebody came to my family one time and I said I had this vision that you called to do such a such a thing oh I'll even go to I'll tell another story I know a minister brother of mine that he said a sister came to him and said you I know God gave me a dream that you're supposed to marry this person your God gave me a dream and he gave me all these things well what that's that's fine if it's led of the Lord because God speaks and dreams and he speaks in visions but it has to be it has to run in continuity with the word and you know I remember there was a story that the I can't remember his name but he's a brother out west that he told he said brother Branham told him how to find the will of God how to know whether it's the will of God in your life and he said there's these three lights and this is a tape table quote I hope I don't get in trouble for telling this but he said that the lights line up there's three lights and the three lights are that the it's got to be in the scripture it's got to be scriptural it's got to be a revelation personally to you that's the second and then God has to make a way for it to happen and then you know that it's the will of God but now if if something leads you off of that path it leads you away from the word you don't have any kind of revelation about it and it takes you in a different direction then stay away from that so see the devil the devil will try to tempt you by taking you away from the word by giving you a supernatural offer and see I'm bringing this out it don't let's not get sidetracked this is important to the lesson because this these are the things that the wheat will not stand they will not fall for the wheat the genuine wheat will see this coming a mile away and the third is a position a position in the church and that's what the devil offer Jesus so I yeah I'll give you all this thing I'll give you a position I'll give you I'll give you king of everything we're not having to die for it and everything but jesus said thou shalt worship the Lord only because that's the answer when when a minister gets up there it's not right for a minister to be preaching on their self and everything and making their self something be seeking a great big position of following it to be an overseer of a group of churches to set themselves up as some great leader because every ministry a god called ministry will always point to Jesus Christ that's what they're pointing to and that's what Jesus said when he said thou shalt worship the Lord only we're not seeking great positions and everything but it's it's written every man julia by every word of god and brother branham said it like this he said not by your proposition I'll make you the general oversee or a presbyter or deacon or I'll let you play the piano because you see people get so tied up in there are little positions and things that if if something happens and they get moved out or whatever something just kind of things move then instead of just letting the Lord have his way have his leading we get all upset about things like that you know all I have in life is let's let's get real here I like to preach I like to help people but if something happened in the Lord it took it away from me this is not all I have all I have is Jesus Christ that's all I have all all I have everything's wrapped up in Jesus Christ and I'm not saved because I'm preaching I'm preaching to help to edify but this is not everything that my whole life and my whole being and everything that I'm living for I'm living for Jesus Christ and I want to help the kingdom of God in any way that I can don't get me wrong now oh brother chance I'm gonna get in real trouble I'll be wrapping up in just just a minute hang on but so the wheat is maturing the wheat is coming to fruition the bride tree and and the individual tree and what happens when the wheat comes to fruition and you can see the wheat standing against all these schemes of the devil against all these things that the devil throws at them and something happens God has called for a separation and when the wheat begins to mature then the shut will pull away why why now now let's think about this for a second and what be closing and just give me give me like three more minutes and we'll be closing real quick now when Jesus began to preach he went out in the healing the sick and and discerning spirits casting out Devils and all of those things but then when he began to preach the word everything else began to pull away all the people began to pull away and what really did it was he said you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood and he said things like I and my father are one because because he knew his position he knew what was going on and when the wheat begins to come to a place where she knows who she is and has come to a position and she says I have an understanding of what the message was about then others it begins begins to draw away my brother brems said in the harvest time he said in that day jesus said when the Son of Man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people the word itself made flesh in you what happens to it he said what happens to that church finally listen that shut pulls away from that week when it begins to be manifested what happened the life was in the shook went all out in the week and the ministers can go ahead and come cuz I'm gonna I'm just gonna wrap wrap up and he said again in the harvest time he said not any man may touch it it's all pulling away we'll have nothing to do with it you have to do that he said this is where he said oh brother get in the wheat let your life this and you come out into the wheat will you believe God just stay with God are you sure you're going to make it when he said once again he said and the anointed ones at the end time notice the anointed ones only the word will separate them not the signs everybody's doing the science the only thing that will separate them is the word and it will be just like in the days of Jesus just like in the days of Jesus where Apollo said I don't know anything about the Son of Man they were able to teach Apollo's but will there be time left well there'll be time to absorb all the things that we've heard all over the years and to grow up or we'll well the time is running out it's time to get in the wheat plant and I'm gonna go ahead and turn it over to both day [Applause] [Applause] make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate it but I believe it don't you I believe it we're in the wheat time we're not in all these others we drill [Music] we're not someone [Music] see the star under anybody have a name [Music] then sings flush [Music] a manatee anybody happened to eat the Alberto [Music] see [Music] what about it you heard a great message that let's receive the benefits of to believe that we are the bride [Music] of TV's crash how much great sing could it be down the world or all the things are being the brown across oh great then sings my soul [Music] you're not Oh [Music] anybody else would have a need him to know those books would get hanging around those classroom and everything you know the ball to do it it just keeps getting sicker and sicker nice work [Music] take away then stay fire say you're gong to be great oh great anybody else just have a name then sings my soul my Savior God oh great down you Anna call from the hospital and said Little Lily they've not been able to see a doctor yet you know but she's running a temperature of 103 so that's giving too much there that to hospital but yet not able to see a doctor yet or anything to do so let's all just pray and ask the Lord to take care of that and make everything to be alright we'll head that way as quick as we get through and see that everything will be all right we believe it it's a finished product make sure you tell their brother how much you appreciate the message we enjoyed it and then remember to Bible study on Saturday praying one for another okay father we thank you that we have heard your word tonight we believe it we've had an opportunity that the world has never been able to receive because they can't listen they don't have the years that they were able to hear they don't have the ability to be able to just sit down and get away from their own ideas and accept what you have to say unto us the Lord we thank you for the message and not in the messenger that brought it in to us we love you for your word because it is true and you are your word we ask you now that you'd go there and be with a little Lily Lord and you take away that temperature we condemn it under the blood of Jesus Christ and saying Satan you have to take your hands off because the little bride is calling for it it's all the finished product nosed around the world and all that are watching today and whatever the time they're still praying to Lord and we all pray and bind this power of the devil in the name of Jesus Christ you just made us pray one for another [Music] you
