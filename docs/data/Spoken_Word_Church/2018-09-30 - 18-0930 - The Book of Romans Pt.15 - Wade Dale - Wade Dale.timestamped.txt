[0:19] the emergency room with chest pain okay
[0:30] okay let's just keep rim break
[0:33] all right let's get started here we go
[0:35] hope everybody had a good week we did
[0:37] all right we are we are rum we're not
[0:42] keeping being tips today get that out of
[0:44] there barnyard beans that's my buddy
[0:47] over and over again and then we've been
[0:52] reading Romans 8 and we're talking about
[0:53] adoption last weekend still in Romans 8
[0:57] but we're going to continue on and let's
[1:01] just go back and read it again because I
[1:03] think it really is necessary let's start
[1:10] with verse 14 where as many as are led
[1:12] by the Spirit of God they are the sons
[1:14] of God for we have not received the
[1:18] spirit of bondage that's what you were
[1:19] warmly you were born with the spirit of
[1:21] bondage because it bound you to this
[1:23] earth it bound you I'm talking about
[1:25] this afternoon brother Branham talks
[1:27] about your soul already being
[1:30] resurrected you're sold already raptured
[1:32] well we just gotta understand that I'm
[1:35] telling you it's in the Bible we're
[1:37] sitting handling places this that
[1:39] handling place but the Bible says were
[1:42] sitting handling placing we're gonna
[1:44] find out that the very thing is going to
[1:45] change our body is in the Bible it's
[1:47] been in the Bible for it is out here
[1:49] where else you think we're gonna get it
[1:51] from the way to not see the spirit of
[1:55] bondage again to fear
[1:56] we received the spirit of adoption I'm
[1:59] not adoption the spirit of adoption you
[2:01] have to be adopted into the family
[2:03] first before you can come into the line
[2:06] of adoptions everybody agree with that
[2:07] all right my brother Dale always says
[2:10] that God will not adopt Satan's kids and
[2:13] that's right because you don't have to
[2:16] he can't adopt a kid come down I have
[2:19] you don't adopt your own gentlemen okay
[2:22] we have not received the spirit of
[2:23] bondage again to fear but we have
[2:25] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:27] we cry daddy daddy and that was our
[2:30] point last Sunday when you become a
[2:32] newborn babe in Christ you are a baby
[2:34] you make mistakes you crawl you drink
[2:37] milk but fortunately there's a growth
[2:43] development where you got to grow up all
[2:45] right
[2:46] and that's what this is talking about
[2:47] because we are definitely heirs when
[2:50] we're born into the family you become a
[2:52] complete adder right there but it's like
[2:55] we've always said I'm not going to give
[2:59] brother
[3:00] Bobby's gotcha
[3:04] Zack now he can drive that can drive why
[3:08] because he's of age but when that was
[3:11] born or even when he's got him now he's
[3:14] got his set of twins beautiful little
[3:16] girls got one on each side of their nose
[3:19] and got five fingers on each hand one
[3:23] what they're human they have the ability
[3:25] to drive a car but you gonna give you
[3:28] keys to Zoe this why you need a human
[3:32] one chief again she's in you he's your
[3:34] family come with your huh
[3:36] they're your family is your little girl
[3:40] you see what I'm saying that's the same
[3:43] thing God said thank giving my keys to
[3:46] that kid right because remember grams in
[3:50] power without characters to tempt
[3:53] they've got the power they're human
[3:55] beings they happen in two they're
[3:57] intelligent they can do things but when
[4:00] you come to a place of driving a vehicle
[4:02] which would be something you could
[4:05] really hurt somebody with you didn't
[4:07] we're doing then you come to a place to
[4:09] where the world says you have to be 16
[4:13] years old I don't see I don't know where
[4:15] they got that from they you probably
[4:16] need to be about 20 or 25 before they
[4:19] start driving but but we have determined
[4:22] that they come to a stage of maturity
[4:23] and there's things that they can do
[4:25] nobody riding the car when they're baby
[4:28] all the way up to here but there's a
[4:29] point in time where you will you will
[4:32] they already asked me for the keys I see
[4:34] them already for the key to the collar
[4:37] right every kid wants to get in a car
[4:39] and drive it right like that little kid
[4:42] remember a little kid not too long ago
[4:44] with what seven or eight years old got
[4:45] that car and started baby yep Grover
[4:47] down the road course it was pretty
[4:48] disastrous hits and when you run it into
[4:51] the trash can in the trees but you know
[4:54] what though he had the capacity to do it
[4:56] but what the government our common sense
[4:59] would tell you not to give the kid key
[5:01] same way we've got man if you can't get
[5:05] anything out of anything we're talking
[5:06] about get one thing you can sit by the
[5:09] things we see God works by the things
[5:11] that we say right because we can relate
[5:13] to that right there we did not give our
[5:16] car keys to our son until they were 16
[5:19] 18 whatever right God's not going to
[5:22] give you the car keys to the Word of God
[5:25] until you're mature enough to handle it
[5:28] and see remember we're not perfect so we
[5:31] can make mistakes and give the car keys
[5:33] prematurely but he doesn't he doesn't do
[5:37] anything prematurely he knows exactly
[5:39] when you need it but what you have to do
[5:42] is though you got to eat to get better
[5:45] to grow up you gotta eat you gotta you
[5:47] gotta fuel your mind and fuel your body
[5:50] to come to a place to where you don't
[5:53] cry daddy daddy when you come to
[5:55] maturity of the Word of God even who
[5:58] whether someone was preaching not too
[6:00] long ago did Moses why cry that's what
[6:02] most problem one day
[6:06] gotcha shut up bait okay
[6:10] same thing with same time with them all
[6:13] that beautiful many pens but we've not
[6:20] received a spirit of bondage again to
[6:21] fear but we've seen the spirit of
[6:22] adoption whereby we cry daddy day so we
[6:25] knew we are in line of adoption if we're
[6:27] born again okay they'll ask you a
[6:32] question came to me today I mean the
[6:34] other day why did the Bible say that
[6:37] Jesus was constrictive
[6:39] the thing about cognitive thing the
[6:41] thing that was formed in married why do
[6:43] they have to be by the Holy oh I felt
[6:46] God was his father
[6:47] I thought the father produced them not
[6:56] in that with not at that point no no we
[6:59] know they're the same person we're not
[7:01] trying to Terry but the reason it was a
[7:05] Holy Ghost is because that's the only
[7:07] way you can get birth it's by the Holy
[7:11] go that's right the Holy Ghost shall
[7:13] come upon you the Holy Ghost will come
[7:17] upon you we know it was the father we
[7:19] know that but listen why did the Bible
[7:22] not say the father will come to you and
[7:25] you'll conceive in birth time he said
[7:28] the Holy Ghost is gonna come and
[7:30] overshadow you and we know it when open
[7:33] life came from the father but it the
[7:34] Holy Ghost ended see you and I when we
[7:36] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[7:39] receive the holy of himself the person
[7:42] of God we know that but still it makes
[7:45] it so simple
[7:46] the gun used the Holy Ghost to birth
[7:49] himself Jesus so he's going to use the
[7:53] Holy Ghost to birth his children and
[7:58] then okay they all right with that
[8:06] because remember you know what struck me
[8:08] sunbrella rhythm when brother branham
[8:12] when brother branham uses his analogy of
[8:17] of the trinity he goes to that scripture
[8:22] and he says he said that says here Mary
[8:26] was found with a child of the Holy Ghost
[8:28] and he said now when Jesus grows up why
[8:31] like this when Jesus grows up he says my
[8:34] father yeah so the trinitarian is now
[8:39] they have three they got Jesus and they
[8:41] got the Holy Ghost and they got the
[8:43] Father okay
[8:45] but brother ground his plan it's the
[8:46] same person but remember its position
[8:49] right listen Jesus Christ is not on the
[8:53] earth today in a physical form he's in
[8:57] the form of the Holy Ghost right and the
[9:01] people to want to birth us just like he
[9:03] was birth don't remember he was birth
[9:05] right the first time you and I were
[9:07] birth wrong the first time what I'm
[9:09] looking at now but to me birth are born
[9:12] again we have to be birthed pocoyo same
[9:16] way Jesus came because look the reason I
[9:19] struck me is because look they're here
[9:21] if children then heirs heirs of God and
[9:26] joint-heirs with Christ that means
[9:28] whenever he did we get so he got birthed
[9:31] by the Holy Ghost we get work but then
[9:35] that makes us have the same father if I
[9:38] write with it it just gives a little
[9:39] more understanding to do what's going on
[9:47] and I you know you get these little
[9:49] tidbits and it opens up a whole new
[9:51] world because you know last Sunday I was
[9:52] preaching on oh no now that Jesus Christ
[9:56] didn't restore off them and then you
[9:59] know I'm kind of felt a little can you
[10:02] prove he did I pretty big drifters in
[10:04] then right
[10:05] he restore all things Jesus made a way
[10:08] for to be restored hey you'll be proven
[10:12] again jesus walks out of the tomb and he
[10:17] says all power in heaven and earth been
[10:19] given unto me right all power I can move
[10:23] through dimensions I can take this flesh
[10:24] body because remember Satan had just a
[10:27] little bit of hold on I tried to find a
[10:29] quote but brother Graham had this one
[10:30] quote Reese's Satan had a hold of that
[10:32] because remember he disputed the body of
[10:34] Moses so he hasn't he has what we called
[10:38] dibs or a tag of this body because when
[10:42] it was born from Satan comes jesus said
[10:45] if you be the Son of God that you know -
[10:48] there's no fall off the building and all
[10:50] this stuff he really didn't get it but
[10:52] when Jesus walked out of that tomb and
[10:53] he says all power on him Murphy give
[10:55] unto me I told the least means and I
[10:58] would come with it why didn't he just
[10:59] move over into another dimension and
[11:01] take the devil's head go see you later
[11:02] buddy
[11:03] yeah why didn't you do that if he was to
[11:07] restore all things yeah he needed a
[11:12] bride
[11:13] he needed a bride to defeat the devil
[11:16] and we know it's him through them but
[11:19] why did he when he said all power
[11:21] so everything was given to him he
[11:24] could've walked over said devil this is
[11:25] your heater last moment say goodbye he
[11:29] could have done that those remember when
[11:31] he goes to the lake of fire that lets
[11:34] him in the lake fire let's go back don't
[11:39] remember y'all hear this again this
[11:42] afternoon but I believe it's lovely
[11:44] because Satan is not a human he's an
[11:47] angel
[11:49] the Bible says we will judge and
[11:56] we'll talk about a little bit
[11:58] to be continued the rest of the story of
[12:01] me this afternoon
[12:02] the spirits they'll bear witness with
[12:04] our spirit that we are the children of
[12:06] God so we are the children of God when
[12:08] were born but we're still babies and if
[12:11] children then heirs heirs of God what
[12:14] the father and joint heirs with Christ
[12:17] so whatever Christ got we got he got a
[12:19] body changed we get a butter cake he
[12:21] gets a resurrection we get a
[12:22] resurrection whatever Jesus that's what
[12:24] we got do we really believe that we
[12:28] better start bleeding all right so
[12:31] that's the only way we're gonna have a
[12:32] resurrection it's not believe it's
[12:35] coming what we were talking about Benjen
[12:37] this this morning comes from came to
[12:40] church we will listen to one anyway the
[12:46] Gospel grades they were talking about
[12:49] one day the trumps gonna sound and the
[12:51] graves are going to open up and it the
[12:53] trumps already sounded but sees their
[12:57] idea or their denomination are there
[12:59] horses that horse rider has rope through
[13:01] their life telling them that one day and
[13:07] you know though it's like The Walking
[13:10] Dead you know it really is it's horrible
[13:13] that Satan has given this and it's false
[13:16] it has no truth to the college phones
[13:19] but they live by that's why I said thank
[13:23] God for truth we know that the shout
[13:25] deploys the Trump all of that we got the
[13:29] message the trumpet will not come from
[13:31] Jesus coming what they're thinking is is
[13:33] we don't have enough power to do
[13:36] anything so we got to wait for Jesus our
[13:38] slashed brother branham you don't talk
[13:40] about people thing but brother I'm gonna
[13:42] come back slash brother Brown has got to
[13:45] come back and give us something extra to
[13:48] give us that little loop the hope came
[13:52] in 1,100 sermons brother Hamza dragonfly
[13:55] books in the tapes not not something
[13:57] coming something is doing that alright
[13:59] bye alright for that but welcome the
[14:02] voice of the resurrection will come from
[14:04] the bride of Jesus Christ
[14:05] we know it's Christ right but why didn't
[14:09] he just get everybody out of him some of
[14:10] the Saints dead right some of the Old
[14:12] Testament Saints I don't understand why
[14:14] some of them did someone didn't I don't
[14:15] understand that but when we come down to
[14:17] the very end of this thing will read you
[14:19] a quote not in here but up steadily well
[14:22] brother Maurice that scripture by joking
[14:24] he said you would judge each other
[14:25] because when those books are open in
[14:27] Revelations 20 or 21 there's a host of
[14:32] people with that book and how they gonna
[14:34] be getting deeper gonna be judged by you
[14:37] that's the only judgment there is
[14:39] there's a judgment about what somebody
[14:41] has proclaimed and then you'll be
[14:44] together noise don't know why I did it
[14:50] not one more time why didn't Jesus just
[14:52] when you come up out of that gravy go
[14:54] Devils sinners Saints come on the ground
[14:59] it don't work that way that would be too
[15:03] easy
[15:10] he said these are the completed ministry
[15:13] here on earth I tried it take us now
[15:15] write us see I never thought about that
[15:18] to it until the other day when even I
[15:20] read it were Jesus was on the mountain
[15:22] with motors and align them if you heard
[15:25] a sermon you heard what I say hey
[15:27] you don't read that in the book but
[15:31] brother Brown said Moses and Elijah was
[15:33] telling there was something Jesus didn't
[15:34] know about his second coming
[15:36] well see because all power in heaven
[15:38] herbs nothing you doing listen God had a
[15:41] human brain mm-hmm when Jesus was held
[15:44] her he had a white matter of human brain
[15:46] just like me in you and he had to work
[15:48] in that that was his box at that time in
[15:52] humanity had to work in that humanity
[15:54] Tony never said oh I would never have to
[15:56] give on the mentally
[15:57] come out of the grave with a glorified
[15:58] body right so Moses and Elijah was
[16:01] telling her about what his second coming
[16:04] now why do you need to know about a
[16:06] second coming man this guy supposed to
[16:07] know everything he's an eternal God he
[16:11] was Jesus to human man because right
[16:14] here is joy nares if it was if it was
[16:16] Jesus Christ a superhuman man which we
[16:19] know he was listen but he's certain
[16:21] things he didn't do remember he had to
[16:25] leave a city because of their unbelief
[16:28] he couldn't heal them and you think of
[16:30] me and you man that was not on my end
[16:32] you in class you just walk in a room and
[16:33] go everybody's healing yet that don't
[16:36] work God don't work that way you weren't
[16:38] screwed viewing beings hey that's his
[16:41] that yes that's his whole basis is to be
[16:46] defeat Satan comes remember Lucifer and
[16:48] Michael fault he didn't kill Sam he
[16:53] defeated it there's a time when he'll be
[16:56] destroyed yesterday so what's gonna
[16:58] happen here any potential destruction is
[17:00] gonna happen
[17:01] Satan's gonna move out of this this and
[17:05] we're gonna take a lotta change but I
[17:07] say it's still gonna be a lot until all
[17:10] judgment is finished then who's gonna
[17:12] stand in judgment he's gonna stand in
[17:14] judgment who's the judge the Saints
[17:17] shall judge the world
[17:19] the world the Saints will judge the
[17:23] world and we will even judge angels are
[17:29] each good cook that write him a note but
[17:32] you see what were we we love it
[17:34] sometimes we look at things if we go God
[17:37] is this limitless God will he is and
[17:41] it's in the form of the eternal even the
[17:43] Creator though he come down walk with
[17:46] Adam and Eve
[17:47] why did he just stop the fall you know
[17:50] thought about that he's Almighty God he
[17:51] knew that was gonna happen the day he
[17:54] put out of believing you and flesh he
[17:55] knew they were gonna say it but he never
[17:57] said our name uncle sin don't tell them
[18:00] no it wouldn't be free moral agency
[18:02] right that's right that wouldn't be free
[18:04] moral agency God had to allow that to
[18:07] happen so that he could come and be a
[18:09] redeemer and make a way for Elijah to
[18:14] restore all things
[18:15] Collective policy about Elijah shall
[18:18] truly come to restore we know some
[18:21] ministry Jesus Christ I'm not you
[18:22] understand I'm not throwing him out or
[18:24] belittling I'm telling you how it I
[18:25] don't have words so that we can
[18:28] understand things like the Holy Ghost
[18:29] overshadowing made that to me that's a
[18:31] it's a great revelation so you can see
[18:33] what God did to me in you because it
[18:35] wouldn't be heirs and joint heirs if he
[18:37] didn't come that way because really
[18:40] you're not doing that with Christ unless
[18:41] you're born again mm-hmm okay then I
[18:44] understand they're cold and air means
[18:45] you're in the family so in other words
[18:48] what I'm saying is see that really
[18:50] debunks don't the that debunks the the
[18:57] I'm gonna try to put this easy the false
[19:00] doctrine that Jesus was just a man until
[19:03] the River Jordan yeah well if he was
[19:07] then he was a sinner like me in you no
[19:12] way okay
[19:15] we're doing it with cross because we're
[19:18] born again of the Holy Ghost he was he
[19:21] had the Holy Ghost this spirit lost the
[19:23] Spirit of God does look if so they'll be
[19:29] we suffer with him that we may be what
[19:32] glorified together we will stand one day
[19:40] I promise you you'll stand one day in
[19:43] your humanity and you'll say all power
[19:46] in heaven and earth has been given unto
[19:49] me if he said then you gonna be able to
[19:53] say and then what's gonna happen is all
[20:01] the other heirs will come out the ground
[20:03] if children then heirs heirs of God and
[20:06] joint-heirs with Christ if Soviet will
[20:08] suffer him that we might be glorified
[20:09] together for our ranking that the
[20:13] sufferings of this present time are not
[20:15] worthy to be compared with the glory
[20:16] which shall be revealed in Jesus know
[20:20] what I say oh that fruit of the morning
[20:24] in
[20:30] hey that's alright well I'm that man you
[20:36] running on wedding up here but he's
[20:40] gonna be revealed in us for the earnest
[20:44] expectation of the creature are the
[20:46] creation and for those of you the cocky
[20:50] Carla did you notice they upgraded now
[20:53] you've got these little like Scofield
[20:58] has the footnotes in the middle come if
[21:00] you touch that G guess what looky
[21:02] creation they just upgraded about
[21:06] probably a month ago that you can do
[21:09] that now I love it so you got your here
[21:11] vanity slip no it's utility I like what
[21:19] take Carlo brother Massey Braille of his
[21:22] too and I get to turn them home
[21:24] destinies he enjoyed it for the creature
[21:26] our creation thanks Peck tation that
[21:30] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[21:31] of God for the creation was made soon as
[21:37] a vanity why not willingly the world
[21:40] didn't fall willingly it fell because
[21:42] the top dog Adam and Eve did what they
[21:46] did when they fell everything fell
[21:47] underneath it all right
[21:49] go by the reason of him who have
[21:51] subjected the same and hope in other
[21:54] words Christ had become the second Adam
[21:55] to bring it back because the creature or
[21:58] creation itself also shall be delivered
[22:03] so if you want if you you know we got to
[22:05] eat some paints on our body but if you
[22:06] see all these tsunamis and you see all
[22:08] these earthquakes and you see all these
[22:09] things going on
[22:11] yes mining your fault because when we
[22:15] come to full restoration that all stop
[22:20] hmm
[22:22] I said when we crisis already later
[22:24] deeper crisis already out full
[22:26] restoration he is himself one man that's
[22:31] why no man has reached immortality
[22:32] except what one man Christ right right
[22:35] but that scripture will be expanded when
[22:41] it happens to men you okay but the
[22:44] creature was may sell you the manatee
[22:46] not willingly one by the fall but by
[22:48] reason of heaven suggested the same in
[22:50] Hope because the creature itself awful
[22:51] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[22:54] corruption that's the whole thing we're
[22:56] seeing its corruption see even Jesus's
[22:59] body was corrupted it did corrupt him
[23:02] the grave but it was getting old your
[23:04] bodies corrupting as that's why that's
[23:07] why the me Satan didn't have a pet I
[23:09] mean same kind of problem looking at
[23:10] Jesus listen same taking upon he'll say
[23:14] he took me to the synagogue they took me
[23:17] places and he said maybe get home you
[23:22] get no I believe God hid all that from
[23:25] the devil the devil saw enough of it
[23:28] though to go into Herod and all these
[23:29] different ones to try to kill the babies
[23:32] but he couldn't do it because God was
[23:34] hiding himself in simplicity somebody
[23:37] oughta preach a sermon
[23:43] because the creature itself it's always
[23:47] won't get to the end of the chapter yes
[23:50] money shall be delivered from the
[23:52] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[23:53] liberty of the children of God all right
[23:57] you and I for we know Paul for we know
[24:02] that the whole creation groaneth and
[24:04] travaileth in pain together until now we
[24:06] can say that now that was 2000 years ago
[24:07] we can say that now and not only they
[24:11] but ourselves also which have the
[24:13] firstfruits of the Spirit firstfruits of
[24:19] the Spirit is what the firstfruits to
[24:21] come to maturity Paul wasn't Paul came
[24:23] to maturity in his age his spot his box
[24:27] he came to matter in his box but that's
[24:30] not full maturity okay you and I are
[24:34] full firstfruits because you're not a
[24:37] firstfruits of the Resurrection we'll
[24:40] get into that a little bit later on
[24:41] which have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[24:43] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[24:46] and don't you you know the Bible says
[24:50] that the only way you can tell the
[24:52] person born again is for you sign crop
[24:54] for the abomination done in the city but
[24:56] we sign cry for the things that go
[24:58] around the world is happening to all
[25:00] these people and and we know that it's
[25:02] because we are not coming to door D to
[25:06] be able to and you have to be able to
[25:09] help everybody but we will be able to
[25:18] and we're gonna say this be so much of a
[25:21] witness til like brother Brown said
[25:23] they'll go the foolish virgin they're
[25:26] going to come in and ask us for the oil
[25:29] because we're the last word they know
[25:32] where to go
[25:33] why because they know the sign that they
[25:36] have the oil the wise bird doesn't have
[25:39] the oil so a little foolish virgins they
[25:42] don't have the oil they don't go to
[25:44] Walmart look for oil they come to the
[25:46] five wise virgins to try to get oil from
[25:49] them so they know where to go I believe
[25:53] we'll have signs and wonders been able
[25:55] if it won't be a public show so you
[25:56] don't think you can go and stand on the
[25:58] street corner and he'll everybody
[26:00] driving by a car in a car no which is
[26:02] not going to happen all right because
[26:07] remember everybody's got their own idea
[26:09] about the third pole but brother Brown
[26:10] told himself start pulling the opening
[26:12] of the words because they may pass this
[26:13] part this part the opening of the word
[26:18] and nobody's had before and it makes
[26:21] this word warm bright it doesn't make
[26:22] this you know like for Robbins Billy
[26:26] Graham and even brother ground that's
[26:27] all they have their box they're gone
[26:30] they're waiting on us to get them out of
[26:33] the ground
[26:47] we have it in possession they have one
[26:50] anointing yes but it's not inside it's
[26:53] not something they can possess it hasn't
[26:57] become a possession to the to the wise
[26:58] virgin is the possession you're actually
[27:02] not you actually don't have one you are
[27:04] the one you are the owner
[27:08] you're the oil they poured in the lamps
[27:11] and even in the Old Testament y'all
[27:13] remember a long time ago but I preached
[27:15] the sermon about the the bride is not a
[27:18] time the price amount of time people the
[27:21] whole the whole Bible talk to us we're
[27:25] not a time you show on the time for
[27:27] Christ know if you're top of crashing
[27:29] beat the devil hello alright that's what
[27:33] st. one to me if we're not God made
[27:37] manifest they were second persons and
[27:39] that makes us the devil all right but we
[27:45] got to see ourselves in the word mm-hmm
[27:47] and beat the work that's why when we're
[27:51] going to get into the Son of Man the Sun
[27:52] man is the Word made flesh
[27:54] what are you enough with the word make
[27:56] like we're literally this word literally
[27:59] this word made flesh walking on the air
[28:01] mm-hmm like I said last time be we keep
[28:05] talking about thing and if we keep
[28:07] prophesying about things we're gonna die
[28:09] those prophets have to die even the
[28:12] greatest prophet that ever lived in
[28:14] replaces the our teachers Christ be
[28:15] profit yeah do that but they'll come a
[28:18] group of people that will not be a
[28:21] prophesy and group of people so that's
[28:24] what's happened not even in the
[28:25] denominational world whoa grandmom says
[28:27] well you know twenty years
[28:28] now uses makeup then 20 years I love 20
[28:31] years later Jesus went on watching
[28:33] prophesied she did die they die he do
[28:36] prophesy much died you and I are not we
[28:40] think we are prophetic people but we're
[28:44] not all prophets but if you prophesied
[28:47] you're not you show me one to do this
[28:53] whole bottle full of prophecy and every
[28:55] person that wrote this Bible had to die
[28:57] sometime somewhere right right but the
[29:03] resurrection is a lively for people not
[29:05] a dead food a lot of young people when
[29:08] we know the whole creation groaneth and
[29:09] travaileth in pain together till now and
[29:11] not only with a for ourselves off it was
[29:14] how the first with the spirit even we
[29:15] ourselves groan there except waiting for
[29:17] the adoption to wit our to witness or to
[29:22] understand the redemption of the body
[29:24] I think we're understanding it now
[29:26] because the problem right the problem
[29:28] with everybody is is here you stand and
[29:31] 65 million miles away you say I didn't
[29:34] tell my body shame that's the truth just
[29:39] like I said gonna want said well I ain't
[29:42] coming now with heat Lord's coming this
[29:44] was telling Jim we were coming down the
[29:45] road all the whole world thinks that God
[29:48] is just going to come on it's one
[29:49] certain day and the it but man look at
[29:53] all the things they miss they missed the
[29:55] trumpet the show the voice they missed
[29:57] the first resurrection burdens our first
[30:00] resurrection Jesus when the first but I
[30:02] learned resurrection the whole world
[30:04] isn't it the whole world
[30:08] misses the bride leaving the whole world
[30:11] nobody understands that now after half
[30:14] of us there'll be a group of people that
[30:15] will try program so they'll have to be
[30:17] killed because what they believe they're
[30:19] going to try they going to see they've
[30:20] been told wrong because it's not you
[30:24] read there's not - there is -
[30:26] resurrection but this one they miss
[30:29] they're all looking at the general
[30:31] resurrection even mark them when we
[30:32] Viktor Bout Oleanna Lord we know in the
[30:36] general resurrection in the last day
[30:38] that allow groups will resurrect jesus
[30:40] said i am michael what a larger problem
[30:45] well know where the problem what you
[30:47] didn't know holy though if she'd had a
[30:50] hold ago she could still drive beside
[30:51] jesus said i am too but at that moment
[30:55] in the box they were Enda but now it can
[30:58] happen so we are saved by hope we
[31:03] explained that last week I ain't got
[31:05] time to do that right now but we're
[31:08] saved by hope but hope that is seen is
[31:10] not hope what is the hope he is part of
[31:17] faith because remember you have to have
[31:20] faith for something you can't see but
[31:22] hey when Abraham had the baby when him
[31:25] and Sarah had the baby he didn't have to
[31:26] believe for a child no more see that's
[31:30] what you and I got to come to because
[31:33] Abraham actually prophesied that he's
[31:37] gonna have a baby well one day had the
[31:38] baby but now remember to be physically
[31:40] died later on promise was fulfilled at
[31:44] least in promises fulfilled and there
[31:46] you terminal promises but the person you
[31:48] tell one say the person that process I
[31:50] had to die
[31:54] we are prophetic we have prophetic
[31:56] insight insight but you and I are not
[31:59] prophets we're a little Messiah has sure
[32:02] all those things that go together but
[32:04] we're not prophets if we prophet if we
[32:07] are a prophet we are saying something
[32:11] isn't right you got to get back to where
[32:14] Jesus never said thus saith the Lord
[32:17] now brother branham even said to us that
[32:19] the Lord you can't say that stay at the
[32:21] Lord and take a body came that's
[32:25] prophesy
[32:30] because the Bible doesn't say if you
[32:32] saved us that the Lord this mountain
[32:34] will be moved the Bible said if you say
[32:36] I heard a preacher not too long ago and
[32:39] I really enjoyed what he said he said
[32:41] that didn't say if you were a Christian
[32:43] it didn't put any stipulation at all he
[32:45] just said if you say to this mountain be
[32:47] moved and doubt not down in your heart
[32:50] it will come to pass that's my human man
[32:53] take this stuff you see human men can do
[32:55] stuff that's correct and we can if
[33:18] you'll notice a lot of times bro they'll
[33:20] walk by and he lay his hand on you and
[33:22] he'll talk to you or something you know
[33:23] what he's doing I hope you do because
[33:25] I've had it happen to me a couple times
[33:27] you needed something then just one man I
[33:31] I'm just not for this and it's on the
[33:33] Internet
[33:34] I'm not far this shouting and jerking
[33:36] their hair off and throwing them on the
[33:38] floor and you know God's not death God
[33:43] it's not death
[33:44] you don't need you to listen Jesus never
[33:47] raised his voice to the Bell now the
[33:51] neighbors were screaming I read it
[33:52] yesterday and Landreth I mean the team
[33:54] no they don't mean Legion I don't they
[33:58] were why are you here before your time
[34:01] can we go on the swing Jesus didn't go
[34:04] no go
[34:08] I'm sorry prayer lines are fine but did
[34:14] you get something at the end of our did
[34:17] you just get an emotion
[34:19] Jesus never did that and you watch run
[34:22] around and prayer
[34:22] he never done the same thing he would
[34:24] actually just lay his hand or he would
[34:26] never even let his hands he say our
[34:28] system he never raised his voice never
[34:31] if he raised his voice well I think
[34:33] would when he was get quiet you at the
[34:36] end of another play
[34:37] matter of fact you in lovely jerk they
[34:39] say yeah that's what I mean we do all
[34:42] this screaming in : and I mean you've
[34:43] we've done it slap them on the ground
[34:45] and shook them and you know hair pins
[34:47] flying everywhere a man got to person
[34:50] something right but that's not the way
[34:52] it's supposed to be done okay
[34:54] that's not the way we were I don't you
[34:56] know what that come from penticoff I
[34:59] come from the waving of the leaves like
[35:01] you were talking about last Sunday that
[35:03] did not come from I say didn't come from
[35:05] God all healing comes from God all right
[35:07] so don't get me wrong but that is not
[35:10] the proper way because we're not gonna
[35:13] watch the prophets of bale one today day
[35:16] they cut their self jumped all over the
[35:18] place for an hour to get their God to
[35:21] come like it walks up and says pour the
[35:24] water on and died if you be the guy in
[35:28] other words the God of Israel show
[35:29] yourself brother Brown said Elijah and I
[35:32] already had a vision that it's gonna
[35:33] happen so we had a lot of faith you know
[35:35] you have a lot of faith when God shows
[35:37] you a vision that's already gonna happen
[35:38] I mean actually to me that's that's just
[35:41] common sense when God shows you a vision
[35:43] that that tomorrow that you're going
[35:46] that you're going to be driving down the
[35:47] road and you see this car coming and for
[35:51] you to pull over and then they have this
[35:54] massive wreck in front of you and then
[35:56] tomorrow you go to the same place and
[35:58] you pull over that match the track
[36:00] nappin I mean I'm not fail you got fear
[36:03] out of fear I fear when I don't see
[36:06] something right that's what I fear comes
[36:08] from because that's what hope that is
[36:10] seen is not hope
[36:13] cuz it's think I don't hope I'm in
[36:16] church today I'm standing here I don't
[36:18] even have faith that I will be at church
[36:26] but we knew we have patience those those
[36:30] of us it needed for what a man says why
[36:33] is he a hope for it but if we hope for
[36:35] what we see not then do we with patience
[36:39] wait for let's see what does it
[36:44] perseverance those who endure well we've
[36:54] got a toy now eagerly wait what this is
[37:00] though this is the this is the original
[37:02] this is the original Greek this part
[37:05] right here this is your interpreter this
[37:08] is your King James Version and then what
[37:11] in the original it says eagerly wait I
[37:13] didn't bring them to break up brought my
[37:16] own birthday the correction it should
[37:19] say eagerly wait while Isis paired off
[37:21] also help the time for our needs we all
[37:25] have infirmities the stranded just went
[37:27] through an infirmity well of the
[37:28] infirmity for we know not what we should
[37:32] pray for as we ought sometimes you don't
[37:37] know how to pray right sometimes you
[37:40] really just don't know how to write
[37:41] that's right for we know not what we
[37:45] should pray for as we offer lunch but
[37:47] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[37:50] for us with groanings which cannot be
[37:52] uttered in other words inside yourself
[37:55] how many times some of you been woke up
[37:58] before I'm going to walk up a couple of
[37:59] times
[38:00] a person's come on my mind pray for him
[38:03] and you found out they was having a hard
[38:04] time just to clean I did it with dad you
[38:06] know called him and said you know
[38:08] couldn't get in touch with it but see
[38:10] there's things working inside of us that
[38:12] a lot of times we don't see it remember
[38:14] when I told you last Sunday about them
[38:17] about the garden you know you plant the
[38:20] seed and you cover it up you go out
[38:23] there and you stand there for you know
[38:24] five days in a row and you don't see
[38:26] anything let only nothing going on
[38:29] underneath there that seeds gonna absorb
[38:32] moisture
[38:33] cracked open that thing's got a kernel
[38:36] out of it's shell all that's working and
[38:40] you don't see nothing in the earth then
[38:43] it's been put in sometimes you don't see
[38:46] it but all of a sudden yes girl by the
[38:52] way just growing rich
[38:53] thank you sister yes
[39:10] even though graves open up yeah through
[39:18] the wall
[39:23] that's why we'll get into that when we
[39:25] get into food this Mel Kennedy brother
[39:29] Brown explains it very very very very
[39:32] well I mean you don't leave anything
[39:34] spirit cousin picks up the bottom of the
[39:36] soul picked up the theophany he calls it
[39:38] picks up the body that body ain't coming
[39:42] out the ground was out quick
[39:43] well that bodies data and there's a lot
[39:46] of people that's already gone back to
[39:48] this okay but they're underneath that's
[39:50] one of it if you'll see what I'm saying
[39:53] we're gonna read it we've read a couple
[39:56] of Sundays ago just to give you a little
[39:58] teaser then we're playing it the Bible
[40:00] says we're planted and corruption when
[40:04] we go put somebody in the grave we plant
[40:06] them back into the earth above they're
[40:10] raised in incorruption so what comes out
[40:13] of that ground they what went in that's
[40:15] me think of what's happening that
[40:17] theophanies going to come back and
[40:19] change that literal body they lived in
[40:22] to a young person again they're going to
[40:25] step out they don't have to
[40:28] metaphorically yeah they'll come out of
[40:32] the ground dip the foot on the earth but
[40:34] no it's change it's just like that don't
[40:39] get that body and they'll come walking
[40:40] through the doors or through the wall or
[40:42] whatever with no resistance so it's not
[40:47] going to be a lot of it's not gonna be
[40:52] what we even think that he's just gonna
[40:54] be but we're developing into the
[40:56] children are developing to where they
[40:58] can understand what daddy's already
[40:59] saying alright so that's what the Bible
[41:01] says we plant them in corruption and
[41:02] that's the truth we put them in the
[41:04] ground
[41:04] they've not a person one in the ground
[41:06] that didn't have a corrupt body except
[41:07] Jesus and it would occur up did it be
[41:09] lifted in there another
[41:10] go Glassman was in there for days and
[41:13] his body was already stained them they
[41:15] say okay but that didn't harm see we
[41:18] look and we take all this body changed
[41:20] things on you know next Sunday I believe
[41:23] for the next Sunday after that we're
[41:25] going to talk about all these funny
[41:26] changes inna had to have a body changing
[41:29] throat somewhere because he ain't in
[41:31] this dimension
[41:32] you can't take this flesh into another
[41:34] dimension you can't do that right
[41:36] even brother Browns flesh couldn't go
[41:38] into that other dimension it had to stay
[41:41] in the bed there had to be a separation
[41:42] there so that's a lot of things we get
[41:44] into and we're not going to get things
[41:45] to this so let's go
