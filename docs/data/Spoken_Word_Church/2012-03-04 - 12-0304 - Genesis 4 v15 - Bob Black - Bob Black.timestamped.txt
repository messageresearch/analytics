[0:00] on M all right here we go Genesis 4 um
[0:05] I'm trying to get Kane out of uh even
[0:08] into
[0:11] nod
[0:13] um so last time I think we stopped
[0:16] around verse 15 and that's the verse
[0:18] we're going to talk about today and the
[0:21] Lord said unto him who therefore
[0:23] whosoever slay Cain Vengeance shall be
[0:25] taken on him
[0:26] Sevenfold and the Lord said a March upon
[0:28] Cain L any finding him
[0:30] kill so just to recap where we where we
[0:35] come from
[0:37] um you know the Jews have separated
[0:40] Genesis into 12 different divisions and
[0:44] Genesis uh this second chapter is the
[0:46] end of the uh I'm sorry the fourth
[0:49] chapter is the end of the second
[0:51] division and
[0:53] um the way you can think of it is
[0:55] there's 12 different genealogies in
[0:57] Genesis the the genealogy of the
[0:59] creation of the Earth the genealogy of
[1:00] the his history of the heavens and earth
[1:02] the genealogy of Adam the genealogy of
[1:04] Noah the sons of Noah Shem Tara ishma
[1:07] Isaac Esau the sons of Esau and Jacob 12
[1:10] different genealogies and a genealogy
[1:11] tells you where you came from where
[1:14] you're going that uh the uh development
[1:17] of
[1:19] um how things develop so that's what
[1:24] um that's that's part of what Genesis is
[1:26] all about telling us where we came from
[1:30] and that's one of the reasons why Satan
[1:33] hates this book is because it's the uh
[1:37] the history the genealogy of of the
[1:40] believer and of Satan and the serpent
[1:43] seed and
[1:47] um you you know you think about where uh
[1:51] how Abel and Cain par parallel the
[1:55] believer today where Abel had a
[1:58] revelation of where he came came from
[2:00] where he's going and how to have
[2:01] fellowship with God and that's the type
[2:03] of the Holy Ghost filed believer today
[2:05] that we have understanding God has
[2:07] revealed these things to us especially
[2:08] in this age in all the previous Church
[2:11] ages we uh you know they a lot of the
[2:13] things the Loose Ends hadn't been tied
[2:15] together but especially in this age we
[2:18] have a revelation of how to come back to
[2:20] fellowship with God that Cain rejected
[2:23] what Abel's message was and went off he
[2:27] was he received a mark and went off into
[2:30] the Land of Nod took a wife from uh the
[2:33] world and uh is a type of the unbeliever
[2:37] today that that Mark that he received um
[2:41] you know there's a lot of speculation in
[2:42] the denomination about what what the
[2:45] mark of the beast was was it like some
[2:46] kind of tattoo or something but brother
[2:48] bandam said that Mark was unbelief when
[2:51] he took that Mark the Beast he
[2:53] uh you know how what does it look like
[2:56] today when you take the mark the Mark is
[2:59] serpent seed is adultery taking or
[3:03] adding to God's word if you add to or
[3:06] take away from God's word you reject
[3:09] God's um you reject God's plan for your
[3:12] day and that marks you uh there's one
[3:16] quote I don't have it but um where
[3:19] brother R said that when you take the
[3:21] Mark today you go back into your
[3:22] denominational system what really
[3:24] denomination is if you go to the bank
[3:26] and you say you can when you go to the
[3:29] bank and withdraw funds you either you
[3:31] have two choices you can withdraw
[3:32] everything or you can withdraw a
[3:34] denomination and the denomination is
[3:36] only part of the whole and that's what
[3:38] denomination is it's not everything it's
[3:41] just a part man's man's ideas and man's
[3:44] systems and the reason
[3:47] Cain couldn't wouldn't accept Abel's
[3:50] message is
[3:51] because the word was not his absolute if
[3:54] the word is your absolute
[3:57] then if you need healing if you need the
[4:01] Holy Ghost you can look at God's
[4:02] promises and you can Bank everything on
[4:04] that and Cain couldn't he he looked at
[4:07] God's word and said it I'd rather take
[4:09] my own ideas I'd rather take um or in
[4:13] this day I'd rather take
[4:15] what my church system my church
[4:18] organization the denomination says is
[4:20] right instead of looking at God's word
[4:21] you know a lot of times you can open the
[4:23] scriptures and show people you know I
[4:26] heard brother Dell many times say it
[4:28] before he's opened the word word the
[4:30] scriptures and pointed to a scripture
[4:31] and said this is why I believe what I
[4:34] believe and this is why it's
[4:36] true and somebody can look at that say
[4:38] well I'm going to take what my
[4:40] denomination says instead because the
[4:42] word is not their absolute my wife was
[4:45] we had a conversation about this
[4:46] yesterday why can you know people from
[4:49] our hom School group come to our house
[4:51] and look we have the pillar fire over
[4:53] our manle the picture of brother randam
[4:55] they look at that and say who is that
[4:57] we'll tell them it's brother Brown
[5:00] Willam brand them and we tell them a
[5:02] little bit about them and they say a lot
[5:04] of times the response well so far every
[5:07] time the response has been oh yeah I
[5:09] know about him and
[5:13] um it just cuts off the whole
[5:15] conversation because they have no desire
[5:18] to know anything about uh the word is
[5:21] not their absolute they have no desire
[5:24] to come and that's that's what Cain's
[5:26] problem was and that's why he was marked
[5:29] and went away and so let's uh that uh
[5:34] let me talk about one more thing if you
[5:36] if you think about
[5:38] um how the first family started and how
[5:42] what a miserable situation that was
[5:44] where
[5:46] Adam his wife left him became
[5:49] impregnated by the Beast she he took her
[5:53] back and now he's got these two sons
[5:57] they're they're born and he's like I
[5:58] don't know which one is mine something's
[6:01] wrong and they they grow older and uh
[6:05] it's it's a it's a family
[6:07] situation that many times in today's
[6:11] life you might be tempted to criticize
[6:14] other people that are in a Sim similar
[6:15] situation but the uh the whole history
[6:19] of the world started with this kind of
[6:21] broken family where um Adam's in this
[6:25] horrible situation that was caused by
[6:28] sin but now I think that's what really
[6:32] if you if you kind of look at Cain's
[6:34] situation
[6:36] where uh Abel had a conversation with
[6:39] him and Cain realized where he came from
[6:44] Abel had that revelation of where he
[6:46] came from and then he told his
[6:48] Revelation to Cain Cain's like okay now
[6:53] and in jealousy he slew
[6:55] Abel and then he he was afraid that
[6:58] vengeance will be taken on him now think
[7:01] about who is left on the earth Cain's
[7:04] afraid that vengeance is going to be
[7:06] taken on him there's only Adam and Eve
[7:10] and Cain and perhaps some of the
[7:13] daughters that were born because the do
[7:14] daughters not listenting the genealogy
[7:17] there's not any other Sons to take to
[7:19] take Vengeance at that time right so I I
[7:23] I I believe that uh What uh what Cain
[7:28] was saying is
[7:31] he's telling God I I am afraid that your
[7:34] seed the sons of God will take Vengeance
[7:37] on
[7:38] me um so let's let's uh look at this a
[7:42] little bit more uh in Romans
[7:45] 12
[7:50] 19 now I believe
[7:53] um that Hebrews 138 is really the key to
[7:57] understanding all scripture because
[7:59] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[8:01] and forever he was the same back there
[8:03] in the Old Testament and you can see it
[8:06] running all the way down it was Christ
[8:07] and Moses that told God a quote better
[8:10] way of doing things it was Christ and
[8:12] able that believe God's word it's Christ
[8:14] all the way down and if you can
[8:16] see any any
[8:19] uh if you want to understand scripture
[8:21] it has to run in continuity through the
[8:23] entire Bible from the Old Testament to
[8:25] the new so Romans 12:19 says dearly
[8:28] beloved avenge not yourself but rather
[8:30] give Place unto wrath for it is written
[8:32] vengeance is mine I will repay sayith
[8:35] the Lord so this uh promise that
[8:38] Cain Vengeance should not be taken on
[8:41] Cain we'll read a little bit later how
[8:43] lamech one of the I think he was the
[8:45] grandson of of Cain he took this a
[8:47] little bit differently and said uh
[8:49] instead of God taking Vengeance leaving
[8:52] the Vengeance to God he decided he was
[8:55] going to take vengance by himself he was
[8:57] wrong and he killed a man
[9:00] Proverbs 20 verse
[9:16] 22 chapter 20 verse
[9:19] 22 20 22
[9:24] 2022 say not thou I will recompense evil
[9:28] but wait on the Lord he shall save you
[9:30] recompense to no man evil for evil
[9:33] provide things honest in the sight of
[9:35] men so I'm going to compare uh I'm going
[9:38] to keep going down this line of thought
[9:41] but in a little bit I'm going to
[9:43] compare Cain was protected from
[9:46] Vengeance but then in the Old Testament
[9:49] you have the Israelites uh as violence
[9:51] increases in the earth they uh you know
[9:54] that God gives the Commandments of the
[9:55] Lord when you murder someone kill them
[9:59] and we're going to take a look at why
[10:00] that's different it seems like it's
[10:02] different
[10:04] um just just uh they know what's coming
[10:07] up
[10:09] Ecclesiastes 8 verse
[10:14] 11-13 I've heard people say before
[10:18] um Ecclesiastes 8 11
[10:28] 13
[10:42] I've heard people say why why do the uh
[10:45] actually heard people say this why do
[10:46] the evil people that I know that have
[10:48] criticized the message why do they live
[10:50] such long Lives why does it seem like no
[10:52] harm comes upon them and uh that's kind
[10:55] of why but my my personally I don't
[10:57] really like that song farther along too
[11:00] much because of the in in the song There
[11:02] Is U you know it talks about Farther
[11:05] Along we're going to know why these
[11:06] people aren't punished right
[11:09] now and
[11:11] uh that's that's my personal sentiment
[11:13] um I'll give youall that be all free in
[11:16] charge uh so let's read read this in
[11:20] chapter 8 verse
[11:21] 11-13 because sentence against an evil
[11:24] is not executed speedily therefore the
[11:26] heart of the sons of men is fully set in
[11:28] them to do evil
[11:30] though a sinner do evil 100 times and
[11:32] his days be prolonged yet surely I know
[11:34] that it shall be well with them that
[11:36] fear God which fear before him but it
[11:38] shall not be well with the wicked
[11:40] neither shall he prolong his days which
[11:42] are as a shadow because he fearth not
[11:44] before
[11:47] God so in other
[11:50] words you just worry about yourself
[11:53] don't worry
[11:56] about and uh and uh you know the word is
[11:59] our absolute so we can take confidence
[12:01] that all things will work together for
[12:03] them that love the Lord not all things
[12:05] will work together for everybody you
[12:06] know people quote that a lot of times
[12:08] they misquote it but it's for them that
[12:10] love the Lord that all things work
[12:18] together let me get my quotes together
[12:20] Timbo HD my quotes for me earlier and
[12:22] just SP scared me half to death off my
[12:27] CL
[12:31] not funny no that
[12:34] wasn't
[12:35] um Matthew
[12:53] 511 now I'm just trying to run through
[12:56] the whole scripture to show how in
[12:57] continuity
[12:59] the the spirit of Christ is not to if
[13:01] someone reviles you or uh uh turns down
[13:04] the message cuz really Abel was a type
[13:07] of Christ and Cain was a type of of
[13:10] Judas the Antichrist and just because
[13:12] somebody turns down your message or you
[13:15] know witness to them and they they stab
[13:17] you in the back doesn't mean you destroy
[13:20] them and return uh Matthew 511 blessed
[13:23] are ye when men shall revile you and
[13:25] persecute you and shall say all manner
[13:27] of evil against you fals
[13:29] for my sake that's the spirit of Christ
[13:33] so
[13:35] um it's
[13:39] now let's kind of look at there's
[13:41] there's two parts to the Sevenfold
[13:43] punishment of Cain first part is to let
[13:46] him alone we're going to look at down
[13:49] through history some stories uh how uh
[13:52] you know in Hosea it says dan and
[13:55] Ephraim were to be let alone um and
[13:58] polycart and the first church at Rome
[14:01] how that story the scripture in Hosea
[14:03] kind of Builds on that and um so let's
[14:06] look is before we look at that let's
[14:08] look at the Sevenfold reproof there's a
[14:11] reason why it was a Sevenfold
[14:14] reproof um
[14:17] originally you know God showed Cain
[14:20] Grace and uh even in a marriage and
[14:22] divorce you you look back to the in how
[14:25] it was in the beginning to see that in
[14:27] the beginning you know we just had it
[14:29] was just one woman one man at the
[14:31] beginning God showed gr can Grace there
[14:33] wasn't any
[14:35] uh he he he killed Abel so let's kill
[14:38] him um and the Sevenfold punishment for
[14:42] anyone that observing Cain repeats his
[14:45] offense so the Sevenfold punishment is
[14:48] to Cain to
[14:50] say you don't need to worry about the
[14:52] sons of God killing you that's it's it's
[14:57] a testimony that uh uh I believe God was
[14:59] testifying to Cain that Cain gets let's
[15:02] say level one of the punishment but Cain
[15:04] says well I'm afraid that Adam and his
[15:07] uh offspring are going to come and kill
[15:09] me God says let it let there be a
[15:12] Sevenfold punishment if vengeance is
[15:14] taken against you now of course this
[15:17] doesn't doesn't just apply to Adam and
[15:19] his offspring it applies to anyone that
[15:21] that takes Vengeance on Kan I'm just
[15:24] trying to to make a point that uh the
[15:26] the spirit of Christ run through the
[15:28] whole Bible and the spirit of Christ was
[15:30] in Abel and and all the that that early
[15:34] family um so let's look at Leviticus
[15:41] 2613 you say you might say there's
[15:44] nowhere else in in scripture
[15:46] where a Sevenfold Repro was given to the
[15:50] children of
[15:52] God in Leviticus chap 26 God is telling
[15:56] Israel how he's going to bless them if
[15:58] they if they obey his
[16:00] Commandments and um and then he tells
[16:03] them what he's going to do if they don't
[16:04] obey his
[16:06] commandments so let's start at verse
[16:10] 13 and this is going to be a lot of
[16:12] reading I think we're going to read to
[16:14] about verse 20
[16:17] 28 I am the Lord your God which brought
[16:20] you forth out of the land of Egypt that
[16:22] you should not be their bond men and I
[16:23] have broken the bands of your yoke and
[16:26] made you go upright but if you will not
[16:29] hearken unto me and will not do all
[16:31] these Commandments and if you shall
[16:33] despise my statutes or if your soul
[16:35] upore my judgments so that you will not
[16:38] do all my Commandments but that you
[16:40] break my Covenant I also will do this
[16:43] unto you I will even appoint over you
[16:45] Terror consumption and the burning Aid
[16:48] thou that shall consume the eyes and
[16:50] cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow
[16:53] your seed in vain for your enemies shall
[16:55] eat it and I will set my face against
[16:58] you you you and you shall be slain
[16:59] before your enemies they that hate you
[17:02] shall reign over you and ye shall flee
[17:04] when none pursueth you and if you will
[17:06] not yet for all this hearken unto me
[17:08] then I will punish you seven times more
[17:12] for your sins and I will break the pride
[17:15] of your power and I will make your
[17:16] Heaven as iron and your Earth as brass
[17:19] and your strength shall be spent in vain
[17:22] for your land shall not yield her
[17:24] increase does that sound
[17:26] familiar neither shall the tree
[17:28] of the land yield their fruits that
[17:31] sounds like Cain's curse the the ground
[17:33] will not yield
[17:35] forth and if you walk contrary unto me
[17:38] and will not hearken unto me I will
[17:40] bring seven times more plagues upon you
[17:43] according to your sins I will also send
[17:46] wild beasts among you which shall rob
[17:47] you of your children and destroy your
[17:50] cattle and make you few in number and
[17:52] your highways shall be desolate and if
[17:55] you will not be reformed by Me by these
[17:57] things but will will walk contrary unto
[17:59] me then will I also walk contrary unto
[18:02] you and will punish you yet seven times
[18:05] for your sins and I will bring a sword
[18:08] upon you that shall Avenge the quarrel
[18:10] of my Covenant and when you are gathered
[18:12] together within your cities I will send
[18:14] the pestilence among you and ye shall be
[18:17] delivered into the hand of the enemy and
[18:19] when I have broken the staff of your
[18:21] bread 10 women shall bake your bread in
[18:23] one oven and they shall deliver you your
[18:26] bread Again by weight and you shall eat
[18:28] can not be
[18:29] satisfied and if you will not for all
[18:32] this hearken unto me but walk contrary
[18:34] unto me then I will walk contrary unto
[18:37] you also in Fury and I even I will
[18:40] chastise you seven times for your sins
[18:44] so you can see that Cain was a living
[18:46] walking testimony that God's word was
[18:49] true and anybody that would look upon
[18:51] him he's a a testimony to not do like
[18:55] Cain did and if you go his way and do to
[18:58] him like he did to God's people then
[19:01] seven a Sevenfold curse will be placed
[19:03] upon you just like here in Leviticus
[19:06] where God says if you will not hearken
[19:07] to my words I'll will give you I'll
[19:09] curse you seven times
[19:18] over the curse was also a this this
[19:21] warning was also a uh I was reading what
[19:26] John Calvin had to say about this and he
[19:28] he had a good point that it it was a uh
[19:32] a way to speedily bring a halt to any
[19:34] downward hurdle of violence where which
[19:37] is what happened with lch side of the
[19:39] family uh where it uh until the flood
[19:43] violence slowly increased because they
[19:46] misinterpreted this as um if somebody
[19:50] does me wrong I'll do them wrong and
[19:52] some violence began to
[19:57] increase
[20:05] let's look at
[20:07] uh first John
[20:15] 5:116 John first
[20:27] John
[20:31] getting into the the believer's
[20:32] relationship with those that reject the
[20:34] message this
[20:36] is now Cain had he had send to sin unto
[20:41] death which is he had totally rejected
[20:43] the message going back into his
[20:45] denominational system um which is not
[20:49] the full word taking or adding to and um
[20:53] Matthew 1 John 5:116 says if any man see
[20:57] his brother s man sin which is not unto
[20:59] death he shall ask and he shall give him
[21:01] life for them that sin not into death
[21:02] there is a sin unto death I did not say
[21:05] that he should pray for it because
[21:07] they've turned down the gospel what good
[21:10] would it do to pray for uh Pain's been
[21:13] marked and he's um going away Matthew
[21:27] 1514
[21:44] actually I started at
[21:46] 13
[21:52] um no let start at
[21:54] 10 and he called the multitude and said
[21:58] unto them hear and understand not that
[22:00] which goeth into the mouth defileth a
[22:01] man but that which cometh out of the
[22:04] mouth this defileth a man then came his
[22:07] disciples and said unto him knowest thou
[22:09] that the Pharisees were offended after
[22:11] they heard this say but he answered and
[22:14] said every plant which my heavenly
[22:15] father hath not planted shall be rooted
[22:17] up let them alone they be blind leaders
[22:20] of the B blind and if they if the blind
[22:22] lead the blind both shall fall into the
[22:26] ditch so if they want go
[22:28] away let him
[22:31] alone um we're just about out of time
[22:34] but uh let me see if I can squeeze
[22:38] in this little story of Dan and
[22:40] Ephraim and it might be kind of
[22:45] hard Rel
[22:53] quick now you brother claw's message
[22:56] Wednesday night really bless me cuz he's
[22:57] talking about about the Levites and um
[23:00] the just to go into the story of Ephraim
[23:04] we need to back up a little bit and talk
[23:06] about uh how the Levites were separated
[23:09] from the Lord
[23:12] um you know a levite and a priest are
[23:15] not the same thing because you're if
[23:18] you're a priest you're a levite but if
[23:19] you're a levite you're not necessarily a
[23:20] priest because to be a priest you have
[23:22] to be a son of Aaron the Levites were
[23:24] separated from God and here's the reason
[23:26] why and y'all don't have to to this I'll
[23:28] just read it in Exodus 32:
[23:31] 26-29 then Moses stood in the gate of
[23:33] the camp and said who is on the Lord's
[23:35] Side let him come unto me and all the
[23:37] sons of Levi gathered themselves
[23:39] together unto him and he said unto them
[23:40] thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel
[23:42] put every man his sword by his side and
[23:44] go in and out from gate to gate
[23:46] throughout the camp and slay every man
[23:48] his brother and every man His companion
[23:49] and every man his neighbor and the
[23:51] children of Levi did according to the
[23:53] word of Moses and there fellow of the
[23:54] people that day about 3,000 men because
[23:58] that all of the Levites it doesn't say
[23:59] just a little bit of them all of them
[24:01] stood for God all of the Levites were
[24:03] chosen to serve God in the temp in the
[24:05] in the temple of the Tabernacle and to
[24:07] carry the the furniture and to take care
[24:09] of stand in the door as watch um and to
[24:13] take care of things
[24:16] um in numbers 18:6 and I behold I have
[24:19] taken your brother and the Levites from
[24:21] among the children of Israel to you they
[24:22] are given as a gift for the Lord to do
[24:24] the service of the Tabernacle of
[24:25] congregation numbers 10 11 28 list the
[24:28] 12 tribes as Ruben Simeon isachar Judah
[24:31] zeul Benjamin Dan naal Gad Asher Ephraim
[24:34] and Manasseh Le Levi since Levi
[24:36] ministered to the 12 tribes they were
[24:37] separate because they were uh they
[24:39] camped in the Middle With The Ark and
[24:41] the Tabernacle and all the other 12
[24:43] tribes camped around him um which is a
[24:46] type of the four gospels guarding Jesus
[24:51] the ministry of the that he the book of
[24:53] Acts which is Christ and the church and
[24:56] um they always camp three side three to
[24:59] a tribes to a side and you'll notice
[25:01] that in Ephraim in Revelation is removed
[25:03] from this list of Tri uh list of tribes
[25:05] and numbers and the reason of what
[25:07] happened to Dan and Ephraim is in
[25:09] Deuteronomy 29:16 to2 where uh God said
[25:15] um trying to hurry Dan
[25:19] uh Deuteronomy 29:16 Dan went worship
[25:23] idols and the Lord said the Lord will
[25:24] not spare him but then the anger of the
[25:25] Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
[25:27] against that man and all the curses that
[25:29] are written in this book shall lie upon
[25:30] him and the Lord shall blot out his name
[25:32] from under Heaven uh the curse of
[25:34] idolatry was to have your name blotted
[25:36] out and in First Kings
[25:38] 12230 uh Dan they set up
[25:41] uh a
[25:44] uh they they began to commit idolatry in
[25:47] in uh Dan and they went to
[25:51] um they made two calves of gold and set
[25:54] that up in Dan so they were blotted out
[25:58] and then uh in Hosea
[26:01] 4:17 it says Ephraim is joined to Idols
[26:05] let him alone so they we have that same
[26:07] theme of there once they join themselves
[26:09] to idolatry which is spiritual adultery
[26:12] and that's the serpent seed spiritual
[26:14] adultery
[26:16] uh just let them alone because at that
[26:19] point
[26:20] there's there're they're going to fall
[26:22] in the ditch as Matthew said uh and in
[26:25] Matthew 24:35 it says Heaven and Earth
[26:27] shall pass away but my word shall not
[26:29] pass away and God remembered his word in
[26:30] Deuteronomy by removing Dan and epim
[26:32] from the final list of tribes sealed in
[26:35] the
[26:36] 144,000 um so next time we'll look at
[26:40] how that that promise in Hosea leave him
[26:42] alone at carries forward to the story of
[26:45] polycarp in the First Church of Rome
[26:48] so I'll get out of
[26:56] here
[27:00] oh
