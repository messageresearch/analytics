========================================

and pray for me teaching Sunday school here this morning so I'm going to review my last lesson just for a few minutes and then we'll pray and get started on the lesson for this morning here so last time for you those of you that were here you remember maybe that I was talking about uh Revelation ship and that's not really a word that's not in the dictionary that just my word to say a relationship based on receiving Revelation from God and it is so important that we have this constant flow of Revelation from him we need to get into a position where we have that we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world brother benam said from Exposition of the church ages and I had mentioned my dream that I had a couple years ago about that pond out here outside the church there was not a parking lot but there was a pond there in my dream and I was walking around and around this Pond and as I said last time I was throwing in handfuls of sort of like meal like cornmeal or something like that something for food and and then oil and as I was walking around and around this Pond there was three people three different characters interacting different ways with this Pond this water of the word I would say it would represent the word and the little boy there on the right was just playing kind of playing in the pond jumping in and out sort of like in church out of church back and forth up and down in and out the young lady a little more mature she wasn't a little girl like that in the picture that's the best picture I could find but she was more like a young woman sitting on this slide never getting in the water but always there sort of like she was always there at the pond but not ever fully getting in sort of like a border borderline believer if you will but then the main character that I observed it was so profound is this young lady that was always submerged in that water the entire dream that I never saw her surface from the water I never really fully saw her like come out of the water because I couldn't really tell about her appearance exactly other than she was a young woman and she was always very attentive to me passing around this Pond dumping in this basically uh word in Revelation if you will and she represents the True Believer the bride always there not always just at church but absolutely uh you know always with the with the word always seated in Heavenly places in Christ always ready to receive always with a good attitude and just constantly locked into this relationship this Revelation receiving the word of God this from Brother Bob been wondering if my font is big enough I keep trying to up my size can y'all see that in the back pretty good good then you begin to know him it's not just something that you've heard about but you know him it's a deep internal change a complete shift of your nature now the new birth let's not give this this wrong the new birth is a start of your regeneration you're going to begin to grow in the stature of perfect man that's from Brother Bob October last year and the last sermon of the year last year the watch Night Service brother Andrew gave us this commission to keep walking simply all I'm saying in last lesson and all I'm going to talk about this lesson let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for letting us get to be here Lord once again this morning thank you for your presence here and I pray you bless this lesson let it be a help to your people here and to those who may hear it later be with all those who couldn't be here Lord and give us understanding of your word and just help me to uh to get this across this thought that you've given me I pray in a way that be uplifting to your bride in Jesus name amen So This is Love lesson Part 12 the pool not getting into first second third pool nothing like that I'm just simply talking about this great attractive Force um if you will this attraction between God and us or US and God back and forth and there's it's good to do your daily Bible devotions and read your Bible and matter of fact that's a big part of this matter of fact this really won't happen what I'm fixing to talk about won't happen if you're not doing that so that's very important and being a church fa service and listening to sermons meditating on the word of God but then at some point you come to this mature state where you are locked in you're in that Revelation and this sort of gravitational bond between you and Christ and that's what I'm going to get into in this lesson keep doing that until this pull that's been leading you this pull goes all the way back to not only when you were converted to Christ to being a Christian but even back to as far back as you can remember I like everybody to take time meditate on your life and think back to your earliest memories of even a toddler maybe four years old 3 years old as far back as you remember and start to think about what led you to your conversion and led you all the way to where you are today because Christ didn't just start dealing with you when you were converted he dealt with you since you were a child since you formed conscious memories you can begin to see in my own example that was Christ and my grandma when I was four years old that led me to read the Bible that taught me to read the Bible and pray I said Lord that was you wasn't it it was him and that would come back to me at 15 and there he was was again when I started reading my Bible every day because my grandma taught me that and that was Christ and my parents that took me to church every Sunday and had Bible study in prayer and and uh um when I was growing up that was Christ in all both sets of grandparents and both Sid influenced me in so many ways so think about how Christ influenced you well I like to look at people's lives and study people's lives and think about your little um seemingly unimportant details of your life that are important because Christ is in that leading you um one of my favorite people to look at is Gabby because her life so far out away from Christ it's not such a surprise that I would be serving the lord today cuz I was raised in church she was raised completely away from God by alcoholics that weren't even fit to be parents the social services took them her and Jackie her sister from their biological parents gave them to Uncle John at about when Gabby was 10 years old Uncle John said I don't want them took him back to Social Services dropped them off packed their suitcases and dropped them off said y'all have them so they were orphans from then on till Gabby was 17 and all that time she believed in God and yet he was drawing there was this pool he was drawing her but she didn't serve him she didn't per se love him but she was praying said God give me a family and and when he did he gave her this loving Godly family and she saw something real and that was God pulling her through that family that message family that adopted two sinner girls that didn't even know the Lord a message family that God would have them adopt two sinner girls that don't even know the the Lord and bring them into their home not as foster kids as adopted kids and that they would well at least Gabby anyway would give her heart to the Lord and serve him that was Christ all the way through that Journey so I always like to relate this to Holy matrimonies it so perfectly does holy matrimony is a such a a a blessing and a privilege that you can see those of you who are married to the Lord you can look at your marriage and see so much about Christ about the character of Christ and the love of Christ portrayed in this Union this holy Union between man and wife instituted by God and if it's done right you know it it shows you so much about the Lord that's where this thought came from from what I'm going to talk about today actually came from me thinking about Gabby the other day um and then I realized this relates so much to our walk with the Lord so now that I got you in suspense let's actually get into it here so from Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever listen very closely to this few slides of brother benham's quote here but you find it's that the girl that you love there's something about her as soon as you see her you know you love her you think oh if I could just only get one date with that girl well finally you do and you think it would satisfy that feeling but it doesn't and then you think if I could go with her steady that would do it finally you get to go with her steady it doesn't if she would just let me kiss her I know brother bam didn't believe in premarital kissing okay I don't know anyway if you if you just she would just let me kiss her good night sometime that would do it fin that happens and it doesn't well she would marry me I know that would do it it doesn't there's this longing this pull between you and your spouse that started small maybe from the beginning keeps getting greater and greater and greater and after maybe 10 20 years of marriage if that is nurtured and taken care of and done right that will actually increase it will not diminish it will actually become greater and greater till you can't get enough of each other even family relationship you love her so much feel like you could pull her all the way around through you reach back and pull her again and and trying to that's rude expression it mean like that but I mean what I'm trying to say is you love her love her love her and there's no place you can find what is it she's part of your soul she's part of you that's right and that's that if that's the way God is now we're getting into our thought for the day when you come and find Christ in your heart there's no place you can stop you just keep moving on this meeting that meeting that thing that I made it my slides too big my font it got cut off there but point is you start with your daily devotional just reading the Bible every day and that's what I did at 15 years old I said Lord I'm going to read the Bible every day that's it I just did my daily Duty for years and years and years and years and it got to where that wasn't enough and then I came into the message at 17 and then kept reading the Bible and the message every day for many many years still was enough and now it's just like every waking moment I'm meditating on the word of God listening to sermons worshiping the Lord reading my Bible listening to my audio B and so on like brother Dale all he ever did his whole life was dedicated to this when you get locked into this gravitational pole like between two celestial bodies like two stars that we're going to talk about you get locked in so tight to where there's nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ there's nothing that can come between you there's not a devil in hell that can stop you from believing the message from believing the Bible and from walking with the Lord nothing there's not a woman on this Earth that could deter me from my love for Gabby not a woman that I could ever encounter that could sway me from my love from her that's the type of thing I'm talking about in marriage and I'm talking about that in your walk with the Lord let's go to Genesis 1 and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the the face of the waters I believe brother bam said that could have been millions of years scoffield speculates that might have been millions of years in Genesis 1 where it said in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth period right doesn't specify how much time there period but the Earth was without form and void so there was this time before creation before God really began doing the days of creation I mean before that part there was this time and there was this time in your life before your conversion before God really dealt with you on a more level that he was gooing to you calling you brooding over your life as you were yet a sinner and didn't even love him didn't know him didn't care about him maybe didn't even know of him and yet he would brood over you like that like over the face of the Waters of the earth and there you set what would one day be a bride of Christ started back here in darkness and sin and unbelief and he would yet call through your grandma through your sibling through your friend through your coworker through somebody through a a book or through you know through the Bible Etc and there is that scripture again the Earth was without form and void you our Earth was without form and void Darkness was upon the face of the deep God finds us as Sinners Broods over us coups to us to lead us to Salvation he leads us to through trials exactly to where he wants us this love this pull it leads us through all those things of life it leads us and it's not by chance none of it's by chance Gabby went through some awful things in those time those years of being a foster kid nobody wanting her she was tossed from family to family never really having a home and saying God just please give me a family please give me a home that's all I want and boy he did when it when it came the right time but in all that time there was a purpose and a meaning to every bit of that that's right early in our journey it's it's easy to be deterred um oh and my my early time I was going to say here my early time in the message I was was trying to figure out if this was even right I wasn't locked in there was no like me and Christ really that one I was just trying to figure out if this is even right I this new thing called the message I was like Lord just show me where you want me to be I was at the Baptist church on Sundays for a while and coming here on Wednesday nights kind of back and forth but now I'm locked in there is no absolutely no uncertainty it's like um you know brother B preached convinced and concerned once you're really convinced you're concerned and you're persevering as he preached Philippians 1 being confident in this very thing that he which hath begun a good work and you will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ he that everything God does he begins and then he finishes it if you keep going on with the Lord there's that big if and that's up to you if you keep going on the Lord he starts it and he finishes it he's Hebrews 12 the author and the finisher of our faith I don't know if y'all seen this before but James chapter 1 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above well there's a distinction there there's a good and there's a perfect and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variable variableness neither shadow of turning so there's a reason he did not just say every gift is from God if it wasn't that distinction he would just say every gift is from above but there's a good and a perfect so what's the distinction so if you look up in the original Greek good means Pleasant agreeable agreeable to the senses Pleasant a higher nature excellent Rich valuable but especially like the word agreeable at the beginning of your journey at your conversion you're good okay you're agreeable you're saying Amen to the word and as long as you keep Amen in the word every time you see more you'll amen that word and walk into more and then he shows you more light and you'll walk into more onto your day of perfection here a little there a little you know uh partial to perfect realization if you will you keep on going you're coming to Perfection but that perfect there means brought to its end finished complete wanting nothing necessary to completeness that which is perfect okay so there's a start and a finish like the Earth Genesis 1 God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good didn't say perfect now was it flawed I don't believe it was flawed was it an error I don't believe there was anything God could do in error but it wasn't complete there was something yet to be complete God wanted to form himself into Mankind and and finish his his uh creation by being part of man he wanted to become man he wanted to be human be one with us so there was this everything that God saw he made it was good and that there if you look at that good Again original Hebrew means good Pleasant agreeable there's more to it though there's more to the story there's more he's doing making himself a part of his creation Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I have that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end he knows your end of your journey but he knows here you are down here at the start he sees the entire thing and he knows exactly how to get you to that perfect end Oneness with him being part of the bride of Christ it's only up to us to just keep going with him keep walking keep moving Ephesians 2 and you have he quickened who were back here remember our past life dead and trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love what am I talking about this whole lesson this pull this love wherewith he loved us even when we are dead in sins hath he quickened us together in Christ by Grace you're saved and have to raised us up together made us sit together in heaven plac in Christ that in the ages to come might show exceeding Riches of of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus before our conversion we were dead in our sin and unbelief yet he called us yet he drew us he CED to us I don't know if y'all know this but I love stuff about space and I don't if anybody's ever heard of a binary solar system our solar system is a single star solar system that's all we've ever known we see one Sunrise every day and one Sunset we have one Sun that hosts all these planets orbiting about it did yall know that there are solar systems in the universe that have two or more Suns orbiting around each other in the center of their solar system and there are planets orbiting those two suns there can actually be three or four or five as a matter of fact Polaris uh I believe what we call the North Star as I understand has either three or five stars orbiting about each other it's not just one star I guess that's why it's so bright the point is there are stars interlocked in this gravitational bond this sort of celestial dance through all of time that they're just dancing about each other locked in they can't get away from each other if they want to they're always pulling toward each other as they revolve as they orbit around each other round and round and these other planets orbiting about them at the same time but all the while they're orbiting around and around each other always pulling so hard to get to each other yet they can never get enough of each other they can never get to each other and that's like us in Christ this is what occurred to me other day me and Gabby are so in love that there's this constant pull and I can never get enough of Gabby if I had a 100 years I could never get enough time with her that's how much I love her after 17 years of marriage I love her more than I did when I started that's what occurred to me the other day and I thought how much us in Christ that we're so in love with him that we can't get enough of him there's not enough time in the day to spend enough time with him that you want his word more than anything you're willing to give up sleep and food and and family time and everything for him that's that's what I'm talking about that's the whole lesson so if you don't get anything else to say that's it being locked in with Christ um these solar systems are actually possibly they say more abundant than single star solar systems these are actually a frequent thing it's not a rare thing in our in our universe that they say possibly 50% or more solar systems have more than one star and so it's actually pretty common thing so nothing can deter us from this love with Christ when you come to this position there's no no more swaying you're not fickle you're not double-minded B says double-minded man is unstable in all his ways you're that when you're that way you're that little boy jumping in out of the pond in my dream or that young lady that's just kind of on the edge never getting in but when you're fully submerged in that water you're fully locked in there's gravitational pole nothing's going to move you no devil in hell I get that quote from brother I think it was brother Brady the preacher many years ago and by that time I was locked in I was saying Lord I'm not going nowhere and he I think it was somebody from Jamaica I think it was maybe brother Brady I can't remember and he stood up here and said I don't see a devil in hell that can stop me from believing this I was like yeah I'm there I know what you're talking about nothing can stop you and can never get enough of him never fully satisfied now Leo deia our age we live in um you know the Bible talks about we're and we have U Need of nothing because we're rich in increasing Goods we have all these great things at our disposal Amazon and uh you can get anything you want on Amazon delivered to your door you can get groceries delivered to your door you just have like that Rich Young Ruler your barns are full and overflowing You're Building more Barns and you think but you don't make time for the most important thing for Christ and that love for him that love for him that needs to be nurtured um so and we know Romans 8:28 that all things work together for good to them that love God here we are again with that love to them who are called according to his purpose you all are very familiar with that scripture so I'm going to try to close up with this last few slides here meditate on your past life all the way to the present do this often say it out loud when you're alone sometimes say it out loud if you need to tell yourself your life story and watch how the Bible re relives itself in your life this is a living Bible oh man I wish I had time to say this but you know um watch how you can see Christ moving brooding over you and your paths cing to you and bring you to himself to Salvation and ultimately to Redemption consider the hardships you had to face in life when you were neglected abused mistreated pay attention to the detail not overlooking the smallest most simplistic events God hides in Simplicity I'll say it just for a brief moment the trial with IA that gav and I went through we were walking in Psalm 23 and Mark 4 at the same time Psalm 23 at the end of that trial trial when the Lord came and I realized then that he was there the whole time we were in the consultation Room 2 a am waiting to meet the doctor right before she came in and told us our baby is dying she was the third person that said that the third medical person that affirmed for us that yeah your baby's dying okay this is not a good situation you're in well right before that I'd open my bible to read it and I landed for my daily reading on 1 John 4 he who fearth not made perfect in love I don't want to confuse anybody but there was two things happening there Psalm 23 The Lord prepared a table before me in presence of my enemies my enemies were fear and death I was fearful about my baby dying and those two enemies fear and death were lurking about yet in the midst of that I open my Bible that down to do my daily Bible reading and what was allotted to me for that day my portion for that day was first John 4 he who fearth not me perfect in love that's when I realized I had what I needed that spiritual food and due season that meat that I needed for that moment to overcome that trial right so there's Psalm 23 at the same time see the Bible was reliving itself Mark 4 Jesus was asleep in the back of the ship he was there he was asleep waiting to see what the disciples would do what they believe in this storm being tossed about in the winds and waves would they believe or would they doubt they doubted they came woke him up Master carest thou not that we perish he rebuked them calm the winds and the waves and in our trial day number two or three right before the Apex right before the climax that night that Saturday night we left the hospital to come to church for the Bible study baby dying thought she'd be dead when we got back that's how close she was she was hanging on by just a just a hair and when we were going out the door I said Lord where are you you know my baby's dying where you at same thing the disciples said master car th not that we perish he was asleep I didn't see him moving at all he was asleep in our trial and the first thing he did 2:00 in the morning when we're waiting to meet the doctor in that consultation room at Egon he comes in the room and I was say master car th not that we perish he comes in the room and gives me my rebuke like he did the disciples cuz first John four is my rebuke he who fearth is not made perfect in love that was a rebuke to me I wasn't where I needed to be with the Lord I wasn't perfectly confidently resting in him that all be well with the baby even if she dies everything's fine that's what I was lacking so that was my rebuke and then peace be still was the doctor comes in and says you're a baby's dying but right now she's stable was that not peace be still she was stable she was hanging on by a thread but she wasn't going down so he literally rebuked me like he did the disciples in John in Mark 4 and then he said peace be still to the winds and the waves that looked like it was in any moment going to take her brother Wade from uh February just February 2nd just about a week ago your life starts with a saying somebody told you about brother Brandon somebody told you about Jesus Christ you might not have known you might not know nothing you just heard something a saying a deed you started coming to church you started trying to do the things then when you get born again what it become a Doctrine it become what you live by you're bound gravitation to Christ you're bound you're you're um nothing can separate you from him anymore uh you musicians go ahead and come please and then what the word's going to be incarnate in me and in you listen the doctrine we have today is what's going to take us out of here nothing else there's not a new doctrine from another preacher or a new sermon coming or a new it's here it's just getting in and becoming it B gra and P is here now they said Jonah was backsliding this is brother Bob was preaching the other day about Jonah and gab and I were talking about Jonah was he really backsliding or not well it depends a a lot about perspective if you're looking at God's perfect will yeah he looked backsliding but if you look at God's permissive will that how God brought him around though he was going the opposite direction God brought him right back around to where he needed to be and really use the trial or use that I guess you can say Disobedience for a benefit and to um really get his purpose across so God when we were maybe backsliding or maybe not even serving the lord yet he was using all those little things we went through okay and I believe I'm going to close up there because uh you see that God made it all work out right you know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord I sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish you heard God's Voice through all of your sin through all the things you went through in life and your past life God was cooing to you and and brooding to you at some point you began to hear him the start of your journey perhaps you did not desire the Lord that much but as you mature you should want him more than anything and be willing to forsake everything for him Luke 14 If any man come to me and hate not his father mother sister or mother and wife and children Brethren sisters and his own life also he cannot be my my disciple as brother Michael was saying last Sunday or so he talking about that hate doesn't mean despise it means like love less our love for the Lord should be so much greater than I love for even spouse or anybody else so we're in the celestial dance let's get locked into that Celestial dance with the Lord that we never separate from him never let anything come between us again God bless you [Applause] [Music]
