[11:20] evening
[11:21] you glad to be in the house of the lord
[11:25] let's go ahead and turn over into the
[11:26] book of genesis chapter 22 and we'll
[11:29] read verses 15 to 17.
[11:35] thank you
[11:40] you know you think about what brother
[11:42] branham said and the greatest battle
[11:43] ever fought when he was talking about
[11:44] how that ministers are are supposed to
[11:46] give people some some ammunition so
[11:48] to to to fight that battle i know i know
[11:51] we're all in our own little personal
[11:53] we're actually in a war and we're on
[11:54] we're all fighting their little battles
[11:56] and we all have things
[11:58] that we're that we're dealing with
[12:00] and so this evening maybe lord will and
[12:02] i can give you a little bit something to
[12:03] to kind of fight that battle with
[12:05] lay something in your hand and
[12:07] put something on your arm and on your
[12:09] head
[12:10] to fight to fight a little bit better
[12:12] with
[12:14] so uh this afternoon we're going to read
[12:16] from genesis 20 chapter 22 and maybe
[12:19] just take the topic of thy seed shall
[12:21] possess the gate
[12:22] and uh
[12:24] that's i believe that's the topic that's
[12:26] that's loaded for bear
[12:28] loaded for the devil we'll say that
[12:29] loaded for devil
[12:32] amen this is talking about uh
[12:34] uh just to kind of set the context
[12:37] abraham had brought his son isaac up to
[12:40] to sacrifice him and
[12:42] and after all that was done within the
[12:44] angel of the lord begins to speak to
[12:45] abraham and tells him this
[12:47] and before we go into the word let's
[12:49] just go to the author in prayer
[12:51] lord god we're so privileged to be able
[12:53] to look into your word lord jesus to
[12:54] gain strength and to be able to defeat
[12:57] the enemy with lord and i pray god that
[12:58] you'll give us give us power and an
[13:00] anointing lord jesus this afternoon to
[13:02] be able to have understand the true
[13:04] essence of what's written in these pages
[13:06] little god as we look into your word
[13:08] lord we lord we just
[13:10] open up every door lord this afternoon
[13:12] lord god that you'll feel welcome lord
[13:14] to move among the aisles lord jesus and
[13:15] they just have preeminence in our hearts
[13:17] and in our lives this afternoon lord
[13:19] jesus quicken your word to us now lord
[13:21] jesus and help us along life's road lord
[13:23] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[13:25] have this ask this blessing upon your
[13:26] people and upon your word
[13:28] amen
[13:30] and it says the angel of the lord called
[13:33] into abraham out of heaven the second
[13:35] time
[13:36] and said by myself have i sworn saith
[13:38] the lord for because thou hast done this
[13:40] thing
[13:41] and has not withheld thy son thine only
[13:44] son
[13:45] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[13:48] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[13:51] as the stars of the heaven
[13:53] and as the sand which is upon the
[13:55] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[13:58] gate of his enemies now that's a that's
[14:00] a promise right there if we could really
[14:02] understand the essence of what that's
[14:04] saying then there's something there that
[14:06] we can grab a hold to
[14:08] and will give us overcoming power in
[14:10] this hour and he said in verse 18 and in
[14:12] thy seed shall all the nations of the
[14:15] earth be blessed
[14:16] because thou hast obeyed my voice you
[14:19] may be seated the lord at his blessing
[14:20] to the reading of the word
[14:23] now now brother branham when he was
[14:25] preaching thy seed shall possess the
[14:26] gate after trial he he began to relate
[14:29] this story and and actually if you if
[14:31] you study the message
[14:32] as many of us do here in this church we
[14:35] we really study it out and go and and
[14:38] and find the things that brother brown
[14:39] said really really like
[14:42] i like to call unpacking it and all
[14:44] throughout the message brother adam
[14:46] talks about uses this story as a basis
[14:48] to show
[14:49] that what the the the gift that god has
[14:52] given the the bride in this day and all
[14:54] down through the seven church ages but
[14:56] anyway
[14:57] and in this scene brother brown he kind
[14:59] of lays the context he said this is open
[15:01] and one of the most marvelous scenes of
[15:03] abraham
[15:04] and he's he's laying out this story of
[15:07] abraham going up just kind of imagine
[15:09] just to kind of set the stage that he he
[15:11] walks up and he he god has told him to
[15:14] go to sacrifice his only son isaac the
[15:16] son that he had promised him after after
[15:19] all these years of of age and and and
[15:23] trouble and turmoil in his life and
[15:25] and god promised him that he would give
[15:27] him this son and now he's he's come and
[15:29] told him to take him up on this mountain
[15:31] and and sacrifice him and so
[15:34] he he leads isaac up to the top of the
[15:36] mountain and you know brother brahm said
[15:38] that abraham if you really look at his
[15:40] life and that's why the bible says that
[15:42] that we're the seed of abraham
[15:44] because in abraham were all these
[15:46] attributes of things that a believer
[15:48] should should have so if you say that
[15:50] you are the seed of abraham then your
[15:52] life and the way that you look at the
[15:54] gospel should reflect in you in the same
[15:57] way that abraham looked at the word and
[15:59] looked at the promises of god and was
[16:01] steadfast in his faith
[16:04] and so we see this scene opening up at
[16:06] the one of the most marvelous scenes in
[16:07] abraham as he goes up and at the story
[16:09] of jehovah jireh that god would provide
[16:12] right there in that critical hour he
[16:13] provided he provided a sacrifice so that
[16:16] he would not have to kill isaac and he
[16:18] stayed his hand and there in the in the
[16:20] bush trapped in the bush was the was the
[16:22] ram that he was able to go over and take
[16:24] and kill
[16:25] in the stead of isaac now now brother
[16:28] brown said you know that abraham is the
[16:30] father of the faithful he's the father
[16:31] of the faithful so that means being the
[16:33] father of the faithful that you look
[16:35] back to him as your example and
[16:37] everything wrapped up in the way that he
[16:39] looked at the word as how you looked at
[16:41] you also look at the word and he said
[16:43] the promise was made to abraham so
[16:46] abraham that had that promise
[16:48] and he he you look at how abraham just
[16:51] held on to that promise that i believe
[16:53] that god is going to bring this promise
[16:55] to pass
[16:56] and he said only being heirs with him
[16:59] through christ is the only way we
[17:01] receive the promise is through abraham
[17:04] in other words the way that abraham came
[17:07] and looked at the word that's the same
[17:08] way that we get access to every promise
[17:11] that we have in court now now let's back
[17:13] for up for a second and remember what
[17:15] we're talking about here we're talking
[17:17] about the promise that thy seed shall
[17:19] possess the gate so if if abraham got
[17:22] that promise after he went through all
[17:25] the trial and endured all of the things
[17:27] and showed to god that his faith was
[17:29] true and something real
[17:32] now you can become a partaker in that
[17:35] promise that if a if god gave abraham
[17:37] that promise that thy seed shall possess
[17:39] the gate of your enemies now we're
[17:42] sitting in a moment where whatever your
[17:44] gate is whatever the battle is that
[17:46] you're fighting if you're
[17:48] wrapped up in christ and you've got the
[17:50] holy ghost now you've got access to that
[17:53] same promise that abraham had had access
[17:56] to
[17:57] now brother abraham said he was an
[17:58] example to what we should be
[18:01] he was an example to what we should be
[18:03] he said he said abraham was just an
[18:05] ordinary man many times we want to make
[18:07] these these great heroes of the faith
[18:09] something beyond
[18:11] some something something special within
[18:14] themself but all the only thing special
[18:16] about abraham was that he just believed
[18:18] god a man that was taken out of out of
[18:21] uh ur of calde somebody that was just an
[18:23] idol worshiper that didn't know nothing
[18:25] about god but yet one day god came on
[18:27] the scene and spoke to him and pulled
[18:29] him over to the side and said go this
[18:30] way and he turned and he began to walk a
[18:33] little bit different now you see
[18:35] that's the way that he does so many of
[18:36] us we we come out of different
[18:38] backgrounds and come out of religious
[18:40] different religious ideas but yet the
[18:42] the thing that makes us unique the thing
[18:45] that makes us special is not anything
[18:46] within ourselves that we can do anything
[18:49] that when our within ourselves that we
[18:50] can like push up or or pull up or
[18:53] anything but it's just simply that we
[18:55] just believe god
[18:57] so he said abraham was just an ordinary
[18:59] man he was called of god and he was
[19:02] faithful to that call so you see if we
[19:04] say where i'm the seed of abraham and we
[19:07] look back to the father of our faith
[19:09] then we also must be faithful to that
[19:12] call just as abraham was faithful to the
[19:14] call that god gave to him we too must be
[19:17] faithful to the call
[19:19] what that means is when you hear the
[19:21] message of the hour when you look into
[19:22] the word of god you've got to have
[19:25] something to stand for and that is the
[19:27] thing that you stand for in this hour
[19:29] you stand for truth you stand for
[19:31] righteousness you're you're standing
[19:33] something and you're faithful to that
[19:35] you're faithful to the word that you've
[19:37] heard your faith you're faithful to pray
[19:40] and to read and to study you're faithful
[19:41] to come to church you're faithful to it
[19:44] because you are the seed of abraham
[19:47] and he said when god spoke to him
[19:50] abraham now listen to listen to these
[19:51] attributes that he's laying out he said
[19:53] when god spoke to him that abraham never
[19:56] one time
[19:58] doubted that voice never one time did he
[20:01] doubt that voice all along the road when
[20:03] he was going to crucify to kill isaac
[20:06] all along the road of life when after
[20:09] god had pulled him over to the side and
[20:11] said go this way he never one time
[20:14] doubted that voice brother adam said he
[20:16] stayed right with it he stayed right now
[20:19] see if you say that you're the seed of
[20:21] abraham stay right with the word stay
[20:24] right with that voice of god because
[20:26] you've heard the voice of god just like
[20:28] abraham heard that voice of god you see
[20:31] you're on the same journey you're on the
[20:34] same road god pulled you aside just like
[20:37] he pulled abraham aside
[20:39] and he said no matter what the difficult
[20:42] was now listen to this
[20:44] no matter what the difficult was he
[20:46] stayed right with it
[20:49] you know life's road has many
[20:51] difficulties and many bumps in the road
[20:53] many things that come along many pains
[20:55] in your body many things that seem like
[20:57] they go awry you see loved ones pass
[20:59] away loved ones go through troubles and
[21:01] trials and it seems like a long last
[21:04] road that people turn against you and
[21:05] they don't love you anymore and seems
[21:08] like everything is going sideways but
[21:10] yet a real true seat of abraham will
[21:13] stay faithful to the call
[21:15] no matter what the difficulty was he
[21:17] stayed right with it no matter what the
[21:19] devil throws in your path in other words
[21:21] no matter what the gate is in front of
[21:23] you no matter what the day it is in
[21:25] front of the promise of god
[21:27] a real true seed of abraham is going to
[21:30] go right through that gate why because
[21:32] christ has conquered it for you
[21:34] he's already paid the price for you now
[21:37] listen
[21:39] brother brown said
[21:41] he said his faith was getting stronger
[21:43] as he walked as he journeyed his faith
[21:46] was actually getting stronger and
[21:48] stronger
[21:49] amen
[21:50] now now let's pay attention to this now
[21:54] brother brown said that there was
[21:55] there's actually two seeds of abraham
[21:58] there's two seeds of abraham in other
[22:00] words you've got to paint the picture
[22:01] like this there's a seed on the inside
[22:04] something on the inside something
[22:05] supernatural that's taking place
[22:07] something on the inside that'll hold you
[22:09] that'll anc you and then a seed on the
[22:11] outside the seed of your flesh abraham
[22:14] had a natural seed that that produced
[22:16] all the jews and all the israelites and
[22:18] all the natural genes but something
[22:20] something that anchored him that was a
[22:22] supernatural seed and the supernatural
[22:24] seed is what we're talking about brother
[22:26] i'm saying now one of them was natural
[22:28] seed
[22:28] the other one was a spiritual seed
[22:31] one of them was natural by his flesh the
[22:35] other one was the seed of his faith the
[22:37] faith that we also might be abraham's
[22:40] seed by the promised word now you see
[22:43] you you just picture now
[22:45] those two things have always been at war
[22:48] they're at war right now if you've got
[22:50] the new birth down on the inside of your
[22:52] soul you're anchored by that seed but
[22:54] yet it's at war with your outside that's
[22:56] been borne by flesh born by a lust
[22:59] desire a natural seed and that's it war
[23:02] with one another where on the outside
[23:03] you might have boils and aches and pains
[23:06] and things going wrong in your body but
[23:08] there's something down on the inside
[23:10] that's anchoring you that's holding you
[23:13] that seed of god the seed of abraham is
[23:15] what i'm talking about and brother now
[23:17] listen see as his outside began to get
[23:20] weaker and weaker and older and older
[23:22] and his hair began to turn gray and he
[23:25] looked on the outside and began to
[23:26] wonder how can god's promises come to
[23:29] pass how can i get a body change let's
[23:31] say it like how can i see god's word
[23:34] fulfilled in my flesh as on the outside
[23:36] i began to get weaker and weaker on the
[23:38] inside it began to get stronger and
[23:40] stronger and stronger
[23:42] his faith was getting stronger
[23:45] brother brahma said now after he had
[23:46] been tried for 25 long years instead of
[23:50] growing weaker he grew stronger now on
[23:53] the outside it looked like he was
[23:54] getting weaker
[23:56] on the inside he was getting stronger
[23:58] now how many
[23:59] we got to make this personal how many of
[24:01] us sitting here this afternoon on the
[24:03] outside it looks like we're getting
[24:05] weaker and our bodies begin to fail us
[24:07] our bodies begin to betray us as we say
[24:09] our hair begins to grow wider and we get
[24:12] we're getting older on the outside and
[24:13] you begin to wonder
[24:15] is it possible for my body to be changed
[24:17] is it possible for god's word to be
[24:19] fulfilled but yet because you begin to
[24:22] accumulate the word on the inside it's
[24:24] something is beginning to accumulate
[24:26] your faith is growing and growing and
[24:28] growing one day that faith on the inside
[24:31] is going to take over the weakness on
[24:33] the outside
[24:36] [Applause]
[24:38] brother brother said in elijah in the
[24:40] middle offering he said and if our
[24:41] father trusted god
[24:43] and took a promise and impossibility and
[24:45] held on to it for 25 years before it was
[24:48] ever manifested getting stronger all the
[24:50] time
[24:51] his seeds just like the father
[24:54] no matter what happens when we're prayed
[24:56] for is settled getting stronger all the
[24:59] time and he said and he piled those
[25:02] years up he piled those years up so as
[25:05] he got older and his body died out the
[25:08] wombs of sarah the womb where it got was
[25:10] unfertile and therefore his strength was
[25:12] gone
[25:13] and there was it's totally impossible we
[25:15] got to the place where on the outside it
[25:17] looked like the circumstance now let's
[25:19] we got to bring this home now it looks
[25:21] like if you look at all the
[25:22] circumstances if you look at the outside
[25:25] with all this covet and all this
[25:26] sickness and stuff going around the
[25:28] world that people died and things it
[25:29] begins to look like on the outside that
[25:32] you're you become just a failure you
[25:34] become a failure like abraham looked
[25:36] like he was a failure and like like
[25:38] jesus christ on the cross looked like he
[25:40] was a failure when he went to the cross
[25:43] it looked like on the outside he was a
[25:44] failure but he rose in victory and
[25:46] conquered everything conquered death
[25:48] hail in the grave came forth victorious
[25:51] because on the inside there was
[25:53] something there to anchor something
[25:55] there in abraham's life to keep him and
[25:57] there's something there in the life of
[25:59] every christian and bride that's
[26:00] anchoring that's moving you on even
[26:02] though it looks like on the outside see
[26:04] we've got to ignore that natural seed
[26:07] ignore the flesh ignore everything every
[26:10] ignore everything except we're licking
[26:12] to the unseen you see
[26:14] that's why paul said in romans 4 17
[26:16] calleth those things which be not as
[26:19] though they were talking about abraham
[26:21] because abraham called the things that
[26:23] were as though they were not he was not
[26:25] looking at that outside veil he was
[26:28] looking at something that the eyes of
[26:30] the of your flesh cannot behold he was
[26:33] looking he was looking to the promise of
[26:34] god's word
[26:38] you know brother branham
[26:40] he gave us that example of how the old
[26:42] of the new testament are what god wants
[26:44] us to look through as we look to the
[26:46] promises they're like binoculars that if
[26:48] you hold them up to your eyes
[26:51] you use binoculars to look way off to
[26:53] look far off into the distance you see
[26:55] it doesn't make any sense to look at
[26:57] through binoculars at your wrist watch
[26:59] because they're made for looking far off
[27:01] too far off to god's promises you're
[27:03] actually looking at god's promises of
[27:05] what you're going to walk into you're
[27:07] looking you're looking and see abraham
[27:09] was not looking at his present
[27:11] circumstance he was actually looking to
[27:13] a city he was looking for a city that
[27:15] was yet to come and he was walking his
[27:18] whole journey was looking for something
[27:20] looking for something that god was going
[27:22] to manifest in his life
[27:23] maybe not even in his life but down the
[27:26] road his children children one day the
[27:28] seed of abraham would see those things
[27:31] that he looked for come to pass and all
[27:34] the time that he was walking his face
[27:36] began to accumulate it began to build up
[27:38] and build up and his faith was actually
[27:40] accumulating
[27:42] brother brown said in thy house he said
[27:44] friends a conversion outside of the same
[27:46] thing won't last long either
[27:48] he said when you go to church we're
[27:50] talking about accumulating now talking
[27:52] about piling up faith
[27:53] he said
[27:54] well i'm going to join church and i'm
[27:56] going to be baptized if that isn't
[27:58] coming from a heart of love to god
[28:00] yonder it'll never go nowhere
[28:02] all you'll do is join church and be
[28:04] baptized
[28:05] he said but when you're converted to
[28:07] christ a love to christ then you
[28:09] accumulate a faith in christ like you
[28:12] would to your wife or to your husband
[28:14] you accumulate a faith that you walk in
[28:16] that faith
[28:18] he said i don't know you just something
[28:19] about you you just got a something that
[28:21] anchors you there what's anchoring you
[28:23] the love relationship you have with god
[28:26] as you as you keep walking as you keep
[28:28] putting one foot in front of the other
[28:30] it begins to keep building up as you add
[28:32] word upon word preset upon precept your
[28:35] faith begins to grow it begins to grow
[28:37] from just a little baby form and growing
[28:39] and growing piling up until you begin to
[28:42] understand the things of god and
[28:43] understand
[28:44] understand that it doesn't matter what
[28:46] the outside looks like all that matters
[28:48] is something on the inside is taken over
[28:51] something on the inside is in control
[28:54] and god provided a lamb he said what is
[28:56] it love conquers all things love the
[28:59] lord with all your heart with all your
[29:00] soul with all your mind with all your
[29:02] strength then faith will accompany that
[29:04] love he said abraham had to believe god
[29:07] and order love god to believe him you
[29:09] love him and the more you love him the
[29:12] more faith will accumulate the more you
[29:14] love god the more your faith will
[29:16] accumulate and as you go you it's just
[29:19] building up building up you see
[29:21] like you see we want to pay close
[29:23] attention to what we're accumulating in
[29:25] life because you can actually accumulate
[29:27] the wrong thing and so we want to
[29:29] accumulate the word but you know you
[29:31] know i was thinking about so many times
[29:33] that somebody would be healed in brother
[29:35] branham's
[29:37] meetings and then they would go home and
[29:39] they would go listen to the naysayers at
[29:41] their church and they would listen to
[29:42] the people around them in their family
[29:44] that say well you you never really had
[29:46] that that that problem and your body so
[29:48] bad to begin with i don't know if you
[29:50] really got healed and they would begin
[29:52] to you they begin to pile on that
[29:54] accumulate all this doubt instead of
[29:56] actually accumulating something that
[29:58] will build faith you know brother
[30:00] branham equated it with with
[30:01] accumulating junk and there's a lot of
[30:03] junk in our lives if we can get rid of
[30:05] the junk and replace it with something
[30:07] that's real something that's
[30:09] supernatural then we're it'll the the
[30:11] the real the real thing is what will
[30:14] take us somewhere but we got it in life
[30:16] we got to get rid of all the junk all
[30:18] the waste that's so easily beset us all
[30:20] the stuff that's weighing us down now
[30:22] now brother he said in the message faith
[30:24] is our victory he said what if we were
[30:26] going to take
[30:27] now think about abraham looking for that
[30:30] city he's going somewhere and brother
[30:32] ram said what if we're going to take a
[30:33] little trip in 30 days from now to
[30:35] another land and in this land the
[30:38] climate was so wonderful till we never
[30:40] come back no more ain't never coming
[30:42] back
[30:43] when you get there you don't ever want
[30:45] to come back and over there we would
[30:47] never have to die or get old but we
[30:49] would just be there forever could i
[30:51] imagine seeing you going around to the
[30:53] 10-cent store buying up a lot of junk to
[30:55] take with you
[30:56] buying up a lot of junk to pile up and
[30:58] accumulate all your junk so that when
[31:00] you get there you'll have see that
[31:02] doesn't even show somebody in the right
[31:04] place frame of mind to accumulate you we
[31:06] see we so many times we accumulate all
[31:08] this worldliness and all this stuff
[31:10] that's not going to do anyth any good to
[31:12] us to help us get to that eternal home
[31:15] he said you'd be trying to get rid of
[31:17] what junk you had and when you just
[31:19] flustered yourself with joy in one
[31:21] church and then the other you accumulate
[31:23] more junk but if you'll think of where
[31:26] you're going think of that city think of
[31:28] that eternal home if you think of where
[31:30] you're going you'll get rid of a lot of
[31:33] that doubt and nonsense you'll have real
[31:35] faith and i i think about i think about
[31:38] you think about all the junk that we
[31:40] have in our lives all the junk that we
[31:42] carry along with us well we'll we won't
[31:44] even hardly come to church because of
[31:46] all the junk and the baggage that we've
[31:48] got we get offended at one another and
[31:50] it's just a bunch of junk is what it is
[31:52] we get all this baggage of nonsense that
[31:54] people have told us about i don't know
[31:56] if the healing is really for you i don't
[31:57] know if that message is really right and
[32:00] if you get around a lot of people like
[32:01] that you begin to just accumulate a lot
[32:03] of junk and a lot of trash
[32:05] but if you'll stay focused on the word
[32:07] of god and get your head buried in the
[32:09] holy of holies get all wrapped up in him
[32:12] you'll be wound up so much in him until
[32:14] it'll take you somewhere
[32:16] that's why the book of hebrews said let
[32:18] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[32:21] which just so easily beset us and let us
[32:23] run with patience the race that is set
[32:25] before us let us lay aside every weight
[32:28] why because we're going somewhere that's
[32:31] why we dress right because we're going
[32:33] to a place that requires that kind of
[32:35] dress that's why we think right because
[32:37] it's transforming our minds so that we
[32:40] can get there every we got to lay aside
[32:43] that's why the song of solomon says take
[32:45] us the foxes the little foxes that spoil
[32:47] the vines it's the little foxes it's the
[32:50] little the little things of junk of life
[32:53] that that hinders us and calls us and
[32:55] deter us from our goal
[32:57] he said let's get rid of the junk and
[32:59] accumulate something lasting
[33:04] you know what
[33:06] i i've kind of preached this sermon to
[33:08] my my kids before in one form or another
[33:10] and framing it like this that
[33:13] bless their hearts to be to be the a
[33:15] preacher's kids some
[33:18] but but i frame it like this sometimes
[33:20] that i want god i want god and man i
[33:22] want the devil i want everybody to know
[33:24] what side i'm on i will i want everybody
[33:27] to know whose side i'm on and if you're
[33:28] going around carrying a lot of junk with
[33:30] you and posting a lot of junk on
[33:32] facebook and on instagram and everything
[33:34] then can anybody know i want somebody to
[33:36] know whose side i'm on i want to i
[33:39] remember i remember when i was growing
[33:40] up in high school
[33:43] just just bear with me a little bit
[33:44] because
[33:46] when i was growing up in high school i
[33:47] went through a phase where you know i
[33:49] had this big old necklace on and big old
[33:51] gold i i i look like let i'll just put
[33:54] it like this i look like you couldn't
[33:56] quite tell what side i was on
[33:59] now believe it or not but listen to god
[34:01] god will get a hold of you i i put that
[34:04] out there because you know you just like
[34:06] you began to put abraham up on a
[34:08] pedestal you can start thinking that
[34:09] people started off a christian or
[34:11] whatever we didn't start off as a
[34:13] christian we started off a bunch of
[34:14] hoodlums we started off we started off
[34:17] on the side of the road and we needed to
[34:19] be drugged to where we were supposed to
[34:20] be going god had to get a hold of us
[34:24] so listen there was a time in my life
[34:26] when you might look i've looked in my
[34:28] life and been like what i wonder what
[34:30] side he's on but now i won't i want you
[34:33] i want everybody to know that i'm on the
[34:35] side of christ i want to be clean-cut
[34:38] dressed right talking right walking
[34:40] right i want everybody that looks to me
[34:41] to say that go as a christian that's my
[34:43] desire whether or not i believe it's
[34:45] manifesting that's my desire and i i
[34:47] want that for every young person every
[34:49] old person in this church that when they
[34:51] look at you they know
[34:53] listen when they look at your facebook
[34:55] or your instagram they're not
[34:56] questioning whether or not you got
[34:58] makeup on a question whether or not you
[35:00] sneak around behind your mama and daddy
[35:01] with pants on questioning whether you're
[35:03] sneaking around or whether you're really
[35:05] living a life i want somebody to know
[35:07] that i'm on the side of righteousness i
[35:10] want somebody to know that i'm on the
[35:11] side of god i want somebody to know that
[35:14] i'm on the side of the message not just
[35:16] dibble dabble not not just not believing
[35:19] some kind of new lukewarm religion some
[35:21] kind of where you're hot one minute hot
[35:23] when you come to church but when you go
[35:25] out the church door you're cold i want
[35:27] somebody to know whose side i'm on
[35:32] you know the the things you say the
[35:34] actions that you do they they actually
[35:36] represent something you know when you
[35:38] have an ambassador that goes to another
[35:40] nation the ambassador of the united
[35:41] states he'll go to another nation and
[35:43] the things that he says actually
[35:46] represents the united states even though
[35:48] he's not the president even though he's
[35:50] not you know uh maybe maybe somebody in
[35:52] a big authority or whatever but he's an
[35:54] ambassador
[35:55] and and the things that you say and the
[35:58] things that you do when you go out into
[36:00] school and out into the workplace
[36:02] they're actually representing christ
[36:04] because if you say you're a christian
[36:06] and you repre i this ain't even hardly
[36:08] in my nose
[36:09] if you go out into public and you're not
[36:11] representing christ then what are people
[36:14] going to think about that thing that you
[36:15] say you're representing you say you're a
[36:17] message believer but then you go out in
[36:19] public and you're not living the life of
[36:21] a christian you're not doing the things
[36:23] that are right i want somebody to know
[36:25] whose side i'm on i'm on the side of
[36:27] jesus christ
[36:29] now you think about
[36:31] you think about brother brown said lay
[36:34] aside all the junk
[36:35] lay aside all this junk in our life
[36:38] why because there's only one thing that
[36:40] you can take with you out of this life
[36:42] and that's your character and what
[36:44] character do we want to take i don't
[36:45] even want to take my character i want to
[36:47] take jesus christ character with us
[36:50] because that's the only thing that's got
[36:52] eternity with it that's the only thing
[36:53] that's got any eternal eternal quality
[36:55] with it eternal life with it it's the
[36:58] character of jesus christ that's what
[37:00] he's trying to mold in us the character
[37:02] the kind of character where somebody can
[37:04] say something against you and you won't
[37:06] rile back the kind of character that
[37:08] could endure trials the kind of
[37:10] character that can endure temptation the
[37:12] kind of character that can take up your
[37:14] cross and follow him the kind of
[37:16] character that can believe like abraham
[37:18] believes
[37:19] that's the kind of care that's the only
[37:22] thing that you can take with you
[37:25] all the junk of life doesn't matter all
[37:27] the things that all the things that
[37:29] sometimes we think are so important what
[37:31] other young people think about us who
[37:33] cares with other young people that are
[37:35] going down the wrong track care about
[37:37] you i want to care about what jesus
[37:39] thinks about me
[37:47] so we look
[37:48] so we look at
[37:50] he's talking about love
[37:52] you love and the more the more you love
[37:54] him the more faith you'll accumulate
[37:56] and it's all based on love
[37:59] now brother brown in this message he
[38:00] said see the bible the bible now what
[38:03] he's getting at now he's starting to lay
[38:04] down the foundation of what really
[38:06] happened there with when abra abraham
[38:09] and sarah's bodies were changed and all
[38:11] the things that are not written there
[38:12] and he begins to explain how you got to
[38:14] read the bible as though it's a love
[38:16] letter he said the bible is a
[38:18] supernatural book it's written so that
[38:20] it's hid from the school's theologian
[38:22] jesus said i thank thee father thou hast
[38:24] hid it from the wise and prudent and
[38:26] revealed it to babe such as would learn
[38:28] it's a book of love when the love of god
[38:31] comes into the heart then you fall in
[38:33] love with god then he reveals himself
[38:36] the bible meaning the interpretation of
[38:38] the bible is god himself interpreting
[38:41] his promises but the bible is written
[38:43] between the line in other words you you
[38:45] cannot read the bible through some kind
[38:47] of intellectual schooling understanding
[38:49] you can't read it through intellectual
[38:51] conception it's got to be a love
[38:53] relationship it's got to be it's a love
[38:55] letter that you got to understand the
[38:57] meaning between
[38:59] you you've got to have a relationship
[39:00] with the author to know what the real
[39:03] essence of it is
[39:05] it's it's like it's it's revealed
[39:07] through a love relationship with the
[39:09] author and brother compared it to like a
[39:10] love letter that he might get from his
[39:12] wife and anybody else would read that
[39:14] love letter and they would miss the true
[39:16] essential meaning here that they would
[39:18] miss all the things that she might be
[39:20] saying about how i miss you and i love
[39:22] you i care for you and he said i know
[39:24] what she wants to say see whether she
[39:26] tells me that or not see i know what she
[39:28] means because it's my love for her and
[39:32] my understanding you see so many times
[39:34] you'll hear people say well i i want to
[39:36] know what the seals are just drop it in
[39:38] my lap just tell me give me a good
[39:40] intellectual understanding of what the
[39:42] seals are if you want to know the seals
[39:44] or anything else in the bible then
[39:46] you've got to have a relationship with
[39:48] the author because only the author can
[39:50] tell you what the real meaning is so
[39:52] you've got to fall in love with god
[39:54] you've got to follow that's why we come
[39:56] to the church that's actually why we
[39:58] come to church not to not to be school
[40:01] and message theology but to develop a
[40:04] love relationship with the author that
[40:06] can tell us what the real essence of the
[40:08] meaning is
[40:10] now how many of us
[40:14] excuse me y'all
[40:16] how many of us
[40:17] maybe one time our kids when they were
[40:19] young they would bring us a little
[40:20] letter scrawled and crayon and it'll
[40:22] have all kinds of it words
[40:25] that only maybe they only knew what it
[40:27] really meant and you look at it and you
[40:29] say well i all these little squiggles
[40:30] and everything and you look at it and
[40:32] say well i don't know what it means and
[40:34] maybe you show it to your wife or your
[40:36] husband and you say what does this mean
[40:38] i don't know but you then you could go
[40:41] take it back to them the one that drew
[40:44] it and say tell me what this says and
[40:46] they could say well i it says i love you
[40:49] mama it says i love you daddy and you
[40:51] take it back to the author and the
[40:53] author can tell you what it says
[40:55] that's how the word of god is if you've
[40:57] got a relationship with the author you
[40:59] can take every promise back to him and
[41:01] he'll tell you what it says he'll tell
[41:03] you what it means
[41:05] listen that's that runs through through
[41:07] the whole bible from the beginning to
[41:09] the end from what happened in the garden
[41:11] of eden all the way to the book of
[41:12] revelation if you've got a relationship
[41:14] with the author he'll tell you what the
[41:16] essence of it is
[41:20] excuse me
[41:22] now brother brown said the william of
[41:23] sarah was infertile
[41:25] and therefore his strength was gone his
[41:27] strength on the outside and there was
[41:29] it's totally impossible
[41:31] the bible says in genesis chapter 18
[41:33] verses
[41:34] chapter 8 18 verse 10 it says
[41:38] it says now abraham and sarah
[41:41] as they were sitting out there
[41:43] sarah in the tent and and the son of man
[41:45] came walking up and began to have a
[41:47] conversation with him and it says now
[41:48] say abraham and sarah were old and well
[41:51] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[41:54] sarah after the manner of women so they
[41:56] were in a place where it began to look
[41:59] like it began to look like the promise
[42:01] was not going to happen i i'm really i
[42:04] know i'm repeating myself a lot this
[42:05] afternoon but i'm really you know you
[42:07] look around the message and people begin
[42:09] to get old and they begin to get aged
[42:11] and things and things begin to go start
[42:13] going wrong and you begin to get in your
[42:15] mind that you've got to be a young
[42:17] person or you've got to have a great
[42:19] quantity of youthfulness in your life
[42:21] you've got to still have that youthful
[42:22] spark for the word of god to be made
[42:25] manifest in your members but brother
[42:27] brahma said your old age and your
[42:29] problems and your frailty doesn't matter
[42:31] to god it doesn't matter to god one bit
[42:34] your old age does not matter to god your
[42:37] problems don't matter to god they were
[42:39] well stricken in age they might have had
[42:41] all this fatigue and headaches and
[42:44] mental decline and sickness
[42:46] and maybe we'll put it like this
[42:47] embarrassing doctor visits in that well
[42:50] streaking in age you start going to the
[42:52] doctor and you got all these
[42:53] embarrassing doctor visits where where
[42:55] you've got to do things and things that
[42:56] the doctor that
[42:58] that's embarrassing listen it doesn't
[43:00] matter your old age doesn't matter
[43:02] you're friendly i'm preaching a message
[43:04] of edification i'm trying to build up
[43:06] your faith i'm trying to give you
[43:07] something to help you with suck that
[43:09] natural seed on the outside doesn't
[43:11] matter what matters is the seed the seed
[43:14] of abraham on the inside
[43:16] brother branham as he's preaching this
[43:18] he begins to call out people in the
[43:19] audience and he said you people some of
[43:21] you that were crippled you might not see
[43:23] no difference for a while you might not
[43:25] see no difference look at abraham
[43:28] abraham did don't make any difference
[43:30] what that ain't what you're looking at
[43:32] you don't look at your symptoms
[43:35] look at what he said
[43:36] if you say i still feel the pain that
[43:39] don't have nothing to do with it it
[43:41] don't have nothing to do with it if you
[43:43] still feel aches and pains in your body
[43:46] if you can barely walk to your car if
[43:48] you can barely walk up the steps it
[43:49] don't have nothing to do with it he said
[43:51] you've done what god said do he said see
[43:55] don't look at that look at what he said
[43:58] you see this morning we're not looking
[44:00] at our own friendly and our own problems
[44:02] and whether or not we can do it and
[44:04] whether or not we can we can walk to the
[44:06] stairs or whether we can go up and down
[44:08] but we're looking at god's promise and
[44:10] we're looking at what he already said
[44:12] he said i can just see that that gray
[44:14] hair of sarah a little grandma with a
[44:16] shawl over her shoulder and a little
[44:18] dust cap holding a stick going around
[44:20] she said me having pleasure with my lord
[44:23] and him old too in other words we're too
[44:26] old to even think about having relations
[44:28] having marital we're too old for that
[44:30] we're too old we're
[44:32] thinking thinking that she was going to
[44:34] fulfill the word of god by her own
[44:36] ability but no it's not by our own
[44:39] ability it's not by our might or by by
[44:42] power but it's by the spirit of god
[44:45] and he said here was abraham this long
[44:47] beard holding on a stick as he was well
[44:50] stricken in age
[44:51] well stricken in age and i see the next
[44:54] morning
[44:55] his shoulders begin to straighten up the
[44:58] hump come out of his back her hair began
[45:01] to turn they went back to a young man
[45:03] and a woman
[45:04] yeah now see
[45:06] you see brother brown when he was
[45:07] preaching this he said people will say
[45:09] oh
[45:10] if god could just patch me up thinking
[45:13] about abraham and sarah maybe sitting
[45:15] there saying oh if god could just patch
[45:17] me up because we we get in our mind that
[45:20] it's not possible that we've got to be
[45:23] patched up here and there a little bit
[45:24] but god is going to transform our bodies
[45:27] wholly and completely one day we're
[45:29] going to be walking along and it doesn't
[45:31] matter how stricken an age are how you
[45:34] might even be on dialysis it doesn't
[45:35] matter what on the outside looks like
[45:38] but one day he's going to completely
[45:40] transform you he said he didn't just pat
[45:42] sarah up and patch abraham up he turned
[45:45] them back to a young man and woman
[45:47] now that may seem strange but now watch
[45:50] the rest of the word and put it together
[45:52] the word is inspired and you have to be
[45:54] inspired with the word i'm trying to
[45:56] express for you to you just because
[45:58] things might be going wrong in your
[45:59] flesh now is not the hour to be getting
[46:02] laying off your faith laying aside your
[46:04] faith now is the hour to begin
[46:06] accumulating your faith to lay a hold of
[46:08] what god is already saying to believe
[46:10] what he said
[46:14] right after that you see you see right
[46:15] after that
[46:17] read between the lines all of a sudden
[46:19] they up and they go on a vacation to
[46:21] gerrard now garrar is like a 10 or 11
[46:24] day journey all the way over to the
[46:25] coast can you imagine abraham abraham
[46:28] may be talking to sarah and he's like
[46:29] you know what i think maybe it's time
[46:31] for us to take a little vacation after
[46:33] their bodies have been changed and if
[46:35] she was an old woman if she had been a
[46:37] little old lady
[46:38] you can't even in the south you can't
[46:40] get a little old sister to ride in the
[46:42] car with air conditioner for without air
[46:44] conditioning for about 30 miles they'll
[46:46] begin to say i can't put up with this
[46:48] now how would a little old lady put up
[46:50] with a 11-day trip to garrar on the back
[46:52] of a camel when her bones is falling
[46:54] apart and her hair is gray and
[46:56] everything everything's not working
[46:58] right that doesn't make any sense you
[47:00] got to read between the lines see read
[47:02] between the lines of what's happening
[47:04] and then when they got over there the
[47:06] amalek said that sarah was fair to look
[47:08] upon fair to look upon a little old lady
[47:11] fair to look upon
[47:12] there they were going on there on their
[47:14] trip no air conditioning no comfortable
[47:16] seating no rest stops no place to pull
[47:19] over for a quick bathroom break a quick
[47:21] quick trip into the gas station to get
[47:23] some snacks to get some of those little
[47:25] little combos or some some beef jerky or
[47:28] something to get a little root beer or
[47:29] whatever there was no place like that
[47:31] that would have not have been a trip for
[47:32] a for a little old lady to take on see
[47:35] brother brother said see read between
[47:37] the lines it's the type he said it shows
[47:40] that what he is going to do to all the
[47:42] children of abraham he's going to do the
[47:44] same thing to all the children of
[47:47] abraham he said just we're nearing it
[47:49] right now so our stooped shoulders and
[47:52] everything don't make any difference
[47:53] friends it don't make any difference how
[47:56] stupid shoulders you are how gray hair
[47:58] you are how all your bodies begin to
[48:00] fall apart he says in our gray hairs and
[48:02] whatever it is it doesn't matter now we
[48:05] don't look back and let's look forward
[48:06] to what we're coming to that's why the
[48:08] bible in first corinthians says in the
[48:10] moment in the twinkling of an eye in a
[48:13] moment and the twinkling of an eye
[48:15] you're going to leave all of the frailty
[48:16] behind
[48:18] we're not depending on our youthfulness
[48:20] or our vigor we're depending on the word
[48:22] of god to change us
[48:24] in romans 8 22 he says it says waiting
[48:26] we're all waiting the whole creation
[48:28] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[48:30] redemption of our body in other words
[48:33] we're waiting for all that faith to
[48:35] accumulate so that to wit so that we'll
[48:37] understand so that we'll get a
[48:39] revelation that it doesn't matter about
[48:41] all our frailty and all the outside that
[48:44] we'll get an understanding that we're
[48:46] going to step over and then we'll do it
[48:48] from old listen from old
[48:51] to eternal all at once from old to
[48:54] eternal in a blink of an eye and a
[48:56] twinkling of an eye and a revelation
[48:58] just in a moment and a twinkling
[49:01] listen
[49:03] y'all might be falling asleep on me but
[49:05] listen i still believe that there's
[49:07] going to be a rapture i'm standing there
[49:09] there's going to be a rapture i believe
[49:11] that despite all the years of hardship
[49:13] and trials and travails there is going
[49:16] to be a group that takes a body change i
[49:18] believe that some sitting here today are
[49:20] going to be in that number that that one
[49:23] day they'll be walking to see grandma or
[49:25] they'll walk them be walking over to
[49:26] their neighbor's house and they'll be
[49:28] gone they'll be taken away because
[49:30] something will hap what will happen the
[49:32] same thing that happened to abraham and
[49:34] sarah the same thing that happened to
[49:35] enoch transformed by the power of god
[49:39] transformed by that seed of abraham
[49:41] and he said remember this sign that
[49:43] we're seeing
[49:44] this sign that we're seeing was the last
[49:46] sign
[49:47] a man coming up to abraham and sarah
[49:49] talking about things revealing to them
[49:51] the secrets of their heart with his back
[49:53] turned to the tent he said this is the
[49:55] last sign that abraham and sarah saw
[49:57] before the promised son
[50:00] come into existence now now just maybe
[50:04] think about that for a minute
[50:05] frame that in your mind before that's
[50:07] the last sign
[50:09] that sign before the promised son
[50:13] comes into existence before what's the
[50:15] promised son the son of man before the
[50:18] son of man comes into existence is
[50:20] revealed
[50:21] but that will be the last sign the sign
[50:23] of the son of man in other words before
[50:25] isaac himself
[50:27] christ himself would arrive that would
[50:30] be the last sign you think about how how
[50:32] much time has passed since we saw all
[50:35] those miraculous things brother branham
[50:37] turning his back on the congregation and
[50:38] speak of things exactly showing the same
[50:41] sign of the son of man that was shown to
[50:43] abraham and sarah and he said that would
[50:45] be the last sign before you would
[50:47] actually see that promised son come upon
[50:50] the scene he said we're living as it was
[50:52] in sodom the whole system has become
[50:55] polluted the world system everything the
[50:57] church system political system there's
[50:59] nothing politics is so corrupted now
[51:01] politics is so corrupted why are we so
[51:03] wrapped up in politics that's more of
[51:05] that junk that brother baron was talking
[51:07] about if we'll lay aside all of this
[51:09] junk and trash that ain't going to
[51:10] benefit us all then i believe we'll get
[51:12] somewhere he said the systems everywhere
[51:14] are dictators it's all corruption the
[51:17] church has become the same way families
[51:19] have become the same way it's just
[51:21] corruption he said then remember god has
[51:24] got that before you remember he said
[51:27] that he would represent himself in human
[51:29] flesh and would do like he did before
[51:32] sodom before the promised son came on
[51:35] the scene and that's why that's why i
[51:37] believe the message of the hour because
[51:39] it actually fulfills what was spoken of
[51:42] in luke chapter 17. it actually fulfills
[51:44] what was spoken of in matthew 24 that as
[51:47] it was in the days of noah as it was in
[51:49] the days of not so will it be in the
[51:51] days of the coming of the son of man and
[51:53] you there's no other fulfillment of
[51:55] those things of those scriptures outside
[51:58] of the message of the hour there's no
[52:00] other fulfillment and no other
[52:01] denominational system no other system of
[52:04] the world no buddhas no catholics
[52:06] nothing else will you find a fulfillment
[52:08] of those promises in the word the word
[52:10] of god
[52:12] you can look and you can search but you
[52:14] will never find the fulfillment of
[52:16] malachi 4 and of luke 17 and of
[52:19] revelation 10 and revelation 4 and all
[52:21] of those scriptures you'll never find it
[52:23] lined up so perfectly
[52:25] it's indisputable
[52:30] you see now when brother brown was
[52:33] preaching this message
[52:34] you see you conquer you have power to
[52:37] conquer every gate you have power
[52:40] over every gate of the enemy once you go
[52:43] through a trial to prove your faith and
[52:45] so brother branham was laying out in
[52:47] this message that abraham went through a
[52:49] trial and he went his trial was he take
[52:52] your take your child and take your the
[52:54] promised son take him up to the top of
[52:55] the mountain and kill him and he went
[52:57] through all the act he raised his hand
[52:59] with a knife in it he went through all
[53:00] the act and then god came on the scene
[53:02] and provided a ram there in the thicket
[53:06] now now you see brother brown said could
[53:07] you imagine isaac about 12 years old
[53:10] lovely little curly haired boy little
[53:12] brown eyes i'll imagine how that mother
[53:15] felt beautiful young woman and so and
[53:17] his father and one day god said i made
[53:20] you a father of nations through this boy
[53:23] but i want you to take this boy up on
[53:25] the top of the mountain that i'll show
[53:26] you and i want you to kill him up there
[53:28] for a sacrifice could you imagine that
[53:31] could you imagine could you imagine
[53:32] having to do something like that it was
[53:34] a test god god wanted to see if he would
[53:38] believe his word
[53:40] now see he's doing the same thing to you
[53:42] and i he's testing you to see see if
[53:45] you'll stay with the truth and if you'll
[53:47] stay with the truth if you'll stay with
[53:49] it and stand the test there's a reward
[53:51] to that
[53:52] now see he said did abraham fear no sir
[53:54] you've got to have the same attributes
[53:56] that abraham did
[53:58] abraham did not fear abraham said this i
[54:00] am fully persuaded that he is able to
[54:03] raise him up from the dead for i
[54:05] received him as one from the dead and if
[54:07] that commandment of god told me to do
[54:09] this and i've stayed true to it and it
[54:11] paid off to have given me the son god is
[54:14] able to raise him from the dead from
[54:16] which i received him as a figure listen
[54:19] there's some ammunition for you whatever
[54:21] gate you have in front of you in your
[54:22] life that's preventing you from
[54:24] attaining the promise of god there's
[54:26] there's some ammunition if you come with
[54:28] the promise of god in your heart like
[54:30] that i am fully persuaded god is able
[54:35] god is able to give me my children god
[54:37] is able to raise the dead god is able to
[54:40] change my body god is able to bring
[54:42] peace to my home then you'll something
[54:44] to get see something to begin to happen
[54:47] you see brother brother said god made
[54:49] the promise it's up to him to keep it
[54:53] sometimes cease how so often we flip the
[54:55] script on that we'll and we think that
[54:57] it's up to us to prove that we're
[54:58] christians we think that it's up to us
[55:00] to muster up within ourselves the
[55:02] courage and muster up within ourselves
[55:04] you're going to talk to people and you
[55:05] ask them well
[55:06] how did you ever come and they did a lot
[55:08] many times they'll try to explain to you
[55:10] something that they did well well i i i
[55:13] went and listened to the so-and-so
[55:14] philosopher or whatever i went and i
[55:16] tried these things and i tried this
[55:18] little mental exercise and that's how i
[55:20] over but that's not how a christian
[55:22] overcomes a christian overcomes by
[55:24] believing that god's going to do it and
[55:26] then god does it it's not us that does
[55:28] it it's god doing it
[55:32] and brother brother said if god give you
[55:33] pentecostals the holy ghost speaking in
[55:35] tongues how much more ought you to
[55:37] believe his healing power and his
[55:39] goodness and mercy if he did that
[55:41] against all the theologians in the
[55:42] country they said it couldn't be done
[55:44] but god did it because he promised god
[55:48] is able to provide
[55:50] he said when they got up there and he
[55:52] was obedient isaac began to get kind of
[55:54] suspicious he said father here's the
[55:56] wood here is the altar here's the fire
[55:59] but where is the sacrifice and brother
[56:01] brown begins to i'm kind of skipping
[56:02] over some things he began to explain
[56:04] what where did that ram come from when
[56:07] he looked over and heard the bleeding of
[56:08] the ram he said the country was full of
[56:10] lions and wolves and jackals and that
[56:13] sheep devouring beast all around was
[56:15] many obstacles to prevent a ram from
[56:17] coming on the scene and how far back
[56:19] from civilization was he and then up on
[56:21] top of the mountain where there was no
[56:24] water and he had picked up the stones
[56:26] all around to make the altar he had
[56:28] already been over all over that mountain
[56:30] and he didn't see a ram anywhere but all
[56:33] of a sudden right there in the hour that
[56:35] it was needed the most god provided a
[56:37] ram now he said to see how brother he
[56:39] begins to switch and begins to talk to
[56:41] the people in the congregation he said
[56:43] how you going to come out of that chair
[56:44] you in that wheelchair whatever your
[56:46] gait is whatever your problem is in your
[56:48] life how how is that child going
[56:51] to get well are you from that chair you
[56:53] from there you were the heart trouble he
[56:56] said whatever is the matter whatever it
[56:58] is in your life whatever is the matter
[57:01] god is able to provide for himself
[57:03] whether it's headaches or heartaches or
[57:06] heart problems or kidney problems or
[57:08] mind problems or depression or suicidal
[57:10] thoughts whatever it is god is able to
[57:13] provide he's able to provide he's able
[57:15] to come on the scene in the hour of need
[57:18] why because thy seed shall possess the
[57:21] gate of his enemies
[57:23] see abraham believed it the patriarch
[57:26] stayed true to the promise and he give
[57:28] the promise that your seed because you
[57:30] believe my word and regardless of what
[57:33] the circumstance is regardless of the
[57:36] circumstance your seed shall possess the
[57:39] gate of his enemy
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:46] now what what is what is his seed
[57:50] that seed is crushed so if you can get
[57:52] in that get in that seed become part of
[57:55] that then you've got access to that
[57:57] promise you've got access to the promise
[58:00] that thy seed shall forget possess the
[58:02] gate of his enemy now the promise of
[58:04] abraham brotherhood says was that his
[58:06] seed now his royal seed in other words
[58:09] the the supernatural seed we're not
[58:12] talking about a natural seed but the
[58:13] supernatural seed his royal seed also as
[58:16] i told you a while ago and this seal
[58:18] that he give abraham was a seal of
[58:20] promise and the royal seed according to
[58:23] ephesians 4 30 is sealed by the holy
[58:26] ghost after they have stood the test now
[58:28] this comes from galatians 3 16 that says
[58:30] now to abraham and his seed were the
[58:33] promises made he saith unto seeds as of
[58:36] many but as of one not as unto and to
[58:39] cease as a many but as of one and to thy
[58:42] seed which is christ so if you get
[58:44] sealed into christ if you get sealed
[58:46] into him then you've got access to this
[58:48] promise he said you believe every word
[58:50] then you are sealed after the test
[58:53] when we believe every promise in the
[58:55] word then we are sealed by the spirit to
[58:58] confirm the promise
[59:00] that's what is what abraham the way he
[59:01] did it
[59:02] the way abraham did it
[59:04] then and then only have we the right to
[59:07] possess the gate of our enemy now listen
[59:10] to this he said you cannot do it until
[59:13] first you become that seed
[59:16] you cannot do it until first you become
[59:19] you cannot do it on your own he said a
[59:21] lot of people thinks they got to be
[59:22] something a lot of things people think
[59:24] they got to be something or do something
[59:26] to work something up he said just common
[59:29] faith is all you have to to apply the
[59:31] blood by
[59:32] just calm and then it begins to talk
[59:34] about the token now you know how
[59:36] in the old testament they would take
[59:37] that blood and apply it over the little
[59:39] of the door with just some some just
[59:40] some simple basic one of the questions
[59:42] that the young people had when at the
[59:44] youth gathering was how do i have faith
[59:46] just as simple as just coming i believe
[59:49] that when i start my car i'm going to
[59:50] come to church i believe that when mom
[59:53] and daddy promises that they're going to
[59:54] give me an allowance every week that
[59:56] that they're going to give it to me and
[59:57] that's faith that's the same way that
[59:59] you approach the word of god you take
[1:00:01] that little hyssop of that common weed
[1:00:03] and you brush it in the blood and you
[1:00:05] apply it now how did brother brethren
[1:00:06] say to apply it you just say i believe
[1:00:09] that you promised it lord and and i got
[1:00:12] this problem in my life and now i'm
[1:00:14] applying the blood to that problem in my
[1:00:17] life i'm turning it over to you i'm
[1:00:19] putting all my cares upon you i got all
[1:00:22] these problems in my body but now i'm
[1:00:24] applying the blood to the situation i
[1:00:26] need the holy ghost in my life but i'm
[1:00:28] applying the blood to it you promised it
[1:00:30] and now i'm taking the simple faith and
[1:00:32] i'm brushing it through your promise
[1:00:34] through what you did on the cross and
[1:00:36] i'm applying it to the situation that's
[1:00:38] how you apply the you're applying what
[1:00:40] he already did to the situation you're
[1:00:43] applying it how do you do it through
[1:00:45] simple childlike faith just coming to it
[1:00:48] with like a little little a little plant
[1:00:50] that you would grab off the side of the
[1:00:51] road i just believe your promises you
[1:00:54] promised it and that's and i believe it
[1:00:57] he said hear the word
[1:00:59] believe the word apply it
[1:01:01] that's all
[1:01:06] i'm skipping through i'm skipping
[1:01:08] through some things here
[1:01:09] now listen let's look
[1:01:11] i i didn't i really didn't mean to to
[1:01:13] keep you long so i'm gonna i'm gonna try
[1:01:14] to
[1:01:16] to kind of skim through some of this
[1:01:18] he's now see the naturals that you
[1:01:20] there's two c's brother around little
[1:01:21] brown said the two the spiritual seed
[1:01:23] and the natural seed the natural seed
[1:01:26] and he said listen let's just say check
[1:01:28] some of those natural seed and see if
[1:01:30] god kept his word with the natural seed
[1:01:32] which was isaac
[1:01:34] and he said they many of them failed
[1:01:36] bitterly failed because in romans
[1:01:39] chapter 2 for he is not a jew the
[1:01:41] natural on the outside you would think
[1:01:43] that a jew somebody that that was a an
[1:01:46] israelite would be able to fulfill and
[1:01:48] do but that's not what it religion is
[1:01:51] not what we need we need actually we
[1:01:54] need something more than religion we
[1:01:55] need something supernatural
[1:01:57] religion is when you try to do it your
[1:01:59] own self when you try to cover up you're
[1:02:02] going to church and you're going through
[1:02:03] the motions and you're going you've got
[1:02:05] your own little moral code and you come
[1:02:07] to church and you've got some things
[1:02:09] that you believe are right to do and
[1:02:11] wrong to do and you come to church and
[1:02:12] you maybe you pay your tithes and you're
[1:02:14] doing some good works
[1:02:16] but when something supernatural begins
[1:02:18] to takes place it elevates it from just
[1:02:20] from those dead works that you're just
[1:02:21] doing day by day just because of you've
[1:02:24] got some good religion and it begins to
[1:02:26] it begins to make it alive and he said
[1:02:28] so in romans chapter 2 verse 28 says for
[1:02:31] he is not a jew which is one hourly
[1:02:33] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:02:35] outward in the flesh but he is a jew
[1:02:37] which is one inwardly and circumcision
[1:02:40] is that of the heart and the spirit and
[1:02:42] not in the letter and that's when the
[1:02:43] jews began to get mad at jesus because
[1:02:45] he began to explain to them that your
[1:02:47] natural lineage is not good enough you
[1:02:50] need to be born again you need something
[1:02:52] on the inside and they begin to say you
[1:02:54] know our fathers ate manna in the desert
[1:02:56] that's it's written he gave them bread
[1:02:58] from from heaven to eat and he said your
[1:03:00] father's eight men are in the wilderness
[1:03:02] and they're all dead why were they dead
[1:03:04] because they had a good religious
[1:03:06] covering they were nice religious people
[1:03:09] he said death take that word and run it
[1:03:11] see what it means eternally separated
[1:03:14] yet they were abraham's seed death means
[1:03:17] separation annihilation completely
[1:03:20] destroyed see poor folks just because
[1:03:23] we're methodist or baptist or
[1:03:25] presbyterian
[1:03:26] god a little confession and things like
[1:03:28] that the devil believes just as much as
[1:03:30] we do and i'll say maybe maybe
[1:03:32] incorporate this a little bit just
[1:03:33] because we say that we're good message
[1:03:35] people that we come and sit in a message
[1:03:37] church religion is not enough
[1:03:40] churchianity is not enough we need
[1:03:42] something to deliver us from our
[1:03:44] christianity
[1:03:45] it's the power of the resurrected christ
[1:03:47] that will conquer every enemy your
[1:03:49] churchianity and your your religion is
[1:03:51] not at your moral codes and your pursuit
[1:03:53] of something that you believe to be
[1:03:55] important is not enough you need
[1:03:57] something you've got to be identified
[1:03:59] with the sacrifice
[1:04:01] god has got to witness it to it by a
[1:04:04] sealing with the holy spirit that breath
[1:04:06] that sets you up to where there's no
[1:04:07] question of the word
[1:04:09] and brother brown said when a man sees
[1:04:11] the word of god made plain before him
[1:04:13] and identified and then shuts and pulls
[1:04:15] down his denominational curtains there
[1:04:18] is something wrong with that man
[1:04:20] spiritually when he looks through his
[1:04:22] natural eyes of lacking understanding
[1:04:24] and tries to understand it and just
[1:04:25] turns away you need something
[1:04:27] supernatural to give you supernatural
[1:04:29] understanding
[1:04:31] brother brown begins to run through all
[1:04:33] these old testament old testament heroes
[1:04:35] of the faith that that showed that that
[1:04:38] came to the test like daniel that was
[1:04:40] tested for the worship of one two two
[1:04:42] god he was tested for that and then at
[1:04:44] the time of test he stood the test
[1:04:47] he said daniel stayed true to the test
[1:04:50] that there is one god and he possessed
[1:04:52] the gate of his enemy god had closed the
[1:04:54] mouth of the lion
[1:04:57] daniel was not ashamed to pray and
[1:04:59] worship god you began to look at all
[1:05:00] these heroes and how they came to the
[1:05:03] test and how they overcame and how they
[1:05:06] conquered the gate of the enemy and you
[1:05:07] can apply that to your own life and
[1:05:10] conquer the gate of the enemy in the
[1:05:11] same way
[1:05:14] moses that stayed true to the promised
[1:05:16] word before the false impersonators
[1:05:18] janice and jamers in the test that when
[1:05:21] he came and he threw down his
[1:05:23] his rod in front of him and here came
[1:05:24] janice and jammers to try to do the same
[1:05:26] thing he just stood back and waited that
[1:05:29] was his test because he was trusting in
[1:05:31] the
[1:05:32] and what god had told him to do he just
[1:05:34] stood back and and truck you know what
[1:05:36] brother brown said that is i i think
[1:05:38] it's why why it had to be shepherds he
[1:05:40] said that that was a type of of
[1:05:44] of the scripture that says though heaven
[1:05:45] and earth shall pass away my words shall
[1:05:48] never fail and there you've got a
[1:05:49] picture of of moses throwing his serpent
[1:05:52] down and those two other serpents typing
[1:05:54] heaven and earth passing away falling
[1:05:57] being swallowed up by the word of god
[1:06:00] swallowing them up and moses didn't
[1:06:01] throw up his hands say well i guess it's
[1:06:04] all wrong and joshua they came to a
[1:06:06] place called kanesh and he had he passed
[1:06:09] the test the center of the world at that
[1:06:11] time and so much that that was the
[1:06:12] judgment seat and oh they sent out 12
[1:06:15] spies to look at the land and 12 of them
[1:06:17] came back he said 10 of them said oh
[1:06:19] it's too much of a job we just couldn't
[1:06:21] do it well then people they look like
[1:06:23] grasshoppers by the side of them but
[1:06:25] joshua and caleb
[1:06:26] steal the people said wait a minute
[1:06:28] we're more than able to take it no
[1:06:30] matter how little we are or how much in
[1:06:32] the minority it doesn't it doesn't
[1:06:34] matter what the outside looks like god
[1:06:36] is god is able we serve a living god
[1:06:39] that's able to deliver us he said what
[1:06:40] was he doing he was standing true to
[1:06:42] that promise i give you this land but
[1:06:45] you fight for every inch of it and
[1:06:47] you'll fight for every inch of your land
[1:06:49] you you know how we fight we don't have
[1:06:51] to we don't have to get thank god we
[1:06:52] don't have to get a sword of it up and
[1:06:54] and go swiping people's heads off and
[1:06:56] and go fighting like the israelites did
[1:06:59] but we fight by by not accepting any of
[1:07:02] the devil's lies
[1:07:03] we fight but by when you go into your
[1:07:05] workplace and people begin to say i
[1:07:07] don't believe that god that you proclaim
[1:07:09] you're fighting because you're you're
[1:07:11] standing for something that's true when
[1:07:13] you stand your ground and claim what god
[1:07:16] has promised that god promised that for
[1:07:19] he promised healing in your body and
[1:07:21] salvation for your soul and for your
[1:07:23] family you're you're actually like
[1:07:25] fulfilling the scripture that says the
[1:07:27] the violent take it by force you're
[1:07:29] actually you're actually fighting for
[1:07:31] what you believe in and you've got to
[1:07:33] fight for every creature of ground you
[1:07:35] take when the doctor tells you it's not
[1:07:37] possible for you to be healed when the
[1:07:39] doctor tells you something something
[1:07:41] despairing in front of you it's time to
[1:07:43] fight he said no matter how big you are
[1:07:46] and what the opposition is and what the
[1:07:48] doctor said god give the promise it's up
[1:07:51] to god to do it
[1:07:55] he said what did joshua do when he come
[1:07:57] down to the river of jordan he possessed
[1:07:59] the gate that's what he did
[1:08:01] jericho closed up like a turtle in a
[1:08:04] shell what did he do he possessed the
[1:08:06] gate
[1:08:07] even one day when his enemy was trying
[1:08:09] to take him he possessed the gate of his
[1:08:11] enemy so much that he commanded the son
[1:08:14] to stand still how could he do that
[1:08:16] because he had passed the test he had he
[1:08:18] had proven that he was willing to fight
[1:08:21] and stand his ground for every promise
[1:08:23] of god he was willing to take god at his
[1:08:25] word despite how all the circumstances
[1:08:28] looked right
[1:08:29] god is true to his promise no matter
[1:08:32] what he has to do i love this quote he
[1:08:34] said bankrupt the heavens before he
[1:08:37] would let his word go defeated he never
[1:08:39] made a promise that he can't keep
[1:08:42] i'm the lord that heals all that disease
[1:08:44] now if you come to god if you come
[1:08:46] laying laying his promises before him
[1:08:48] like that i believe that you said that
[1:08:51] you'd bankrupt the heavens before you
[1:08:53] let your word go defeated something that
[1:08:55] that's how you conquer the gate
[1:08:57] that's how you conquer every gate of the
[1:08:59] enemy
[1:09:00] and then after all those natural seeds
[1:09:02] finally on the scene came the royal seed
[1:09:05] of abraham the one that we're talking
[1:09:06] about they were all the natural seed
[1:09:08] from isaac but here come the royal seed
[1:09:10] of abraham which was christ abraham's
[1:09:13] seed of faith what we're supposed to be
[1:09:16] just see how whether we are or not
[1:09:18] he said now the natural seed only was a
[1:09:20] type
[1:09:22] all others was born of natural birth but
[1:09:24] he come a virgin birth see
[1:09:26] that wasn't of the seed of abraham then
[1:09:28] a jew he come by the seed of faith of
[1:09:30] the promise and then we're supposed to
[1:09:32] be his children through this man now
[1:09:35] think about what this man did that came
[1:09:37] upon the scene he it looked like he was
[1:09:39] a failure when he died on the cross and
[1:09:41] when he was buried in the grave but he
[1:09:43] when he rose up he conquered and
[1:09:45] possessed every gate the enemy had the
[1:09:48] royal seed he promised it by the word he
[1:09:51] conquered it he conquered every seed he
[1:09:54] now now there's some there are some
[1:09:56] powerful things that i believe will give
[1:09:57] you some ammunition this afternoon i
[1:09:59] feel a little bit like i'm plowing this
[1:10:01] afternoon because i'm fighting some
[1:10:02] sleeping spirits but but but i believe
[1:10:05] there's some
[1:10:06] yeah y'all pull a little bit come on now
[1:10:08] [Laughter]
[1:10:10] hey listen brother brahma said he con
[1:10:12] the the power in this is that it's not
[1:10:15] you that's doing the conquering he rose
[1:10:18] he died on the cross and rose from the
[1:10:20] grave to pay the way for every promise
[1:10:23] in the god of god every promise every
[1:10:25] blessing that's written in the bible
[1:10:27] that's why he said he conquered the gate
[1:10:29] of sickness for us
[1:10:30] that's what he come to do he conquered
[1:10:33] the gate of sickness for us he remembers
[1:10:35] sick people he conquered that gate you
[1:10:37] don't have to conquer it he conquered it
[1:10:40] you don't have to conquer it a lot of
[1:10:42] times we go to the doctor and we get
[1:10:43] that bad report and we feel like we've
[1:10:45] got to conquer it so that we can go back
[1:10:47] to church and we can prove to everybody
[1:10:48] what a christian are what what a real
[1:10:50] christian is but a real christian is
[1:10:52] resting
[1:10:53] rest and you just sit back and you say
[1:10:56] god you promised it i ain't got to do
[1:10:58] nothing i don't have i don't have to do
[1:11:00] anything all i have to do is believe it
[1:11:02] that's how you'll conquer the enemy it's
[1:11:04] just putting all your faith in the one
[1:11:06] that conquered everything when he rose
[1:11:08] from the grave
[1:11:09] the other men had to conquer their own
[1:11:11] gate brother abraham said but you don't
[1:11:13] have to conquer it's already conquered
[1:11:16] he conquered the gates of sickness and
[1:11:19] what did he do when he conquered the
[1:11:20] gates of sickness saying that he would
[1:11:22] whatever you ask on earth and whatever
[1:11:24] you bound on earth he would bind it in
[1:11:26] heaven he said he'd give us the keys to
[1:11:28] the gate so he conquered the gate and
[1:11:31] then he gave you the keys to it so you
[1:11:33] could go through it you could blast
[1:11:34] through it you could say you could just
[1:11:36] ignore all the stuff the devil's doing
[1:11:38] ignore the infirmity of your flesh
[1:11:41] ignore the weakness of your body ignore
[1:11:43] all the gray hairs ignore all the
[1:11:45] naysayers and just plow straight ahead
[1:11:48] to victory he said he conquered the gate
[1:11:51] of temptation by the word and the keys
[1:11:53] was
[1:11:54] resist the enemy and he'll flee from you
[1:11:56] he conquered it all conquered every
[1:11:58] sickness he conquered death and he
[1:12:01] conquered hell he conquered death and
[1:12:03] hell he conquered what the others
[1:12:05] couldn't conquer because they're of the
[1:12:06] natural seed this is the spiritual seed
[1:12:09] he conquered the gate of the grave and
[1:12:11] rose up on the third day for our
[1:12:13] justification and now we are more than
[1:12:16] conquerors we're more than conquerors
[1:12:18] through him if we'll get in him and bury
[1:12:21] ourselves in him we'd be we've become
[1:12:22] through through that because he gave us
[1:12:24] the keys
[1:12:25] he said whatever you bind on earth i'll
[1:12:28] bind it in heaven that's the royal seed
[1:12:30] of abraham his promise
[1:12:32] that's actually fulfilling that promise
[1:12:34] that he gave to abraham thousands and
[1:12:37] thousands of years ago that thy seed
[1:12:39] shall possess the gate of thy enemy thy
[1:12:42] seed thy seed which is christ and if
[1:12:45] you're part of christ christ is working
[1:12:48] through your members christ is working
[1:12:50] through your life to overcome to
[1:12:52] overcome he's seated at the right hand
[1:12:53] of the father to overcome every battle
[1:12:56] to fight every sickness to fight
[1:12:58] everything that the devil throws at you
[1:13:00] you see we're not a defeated army we're
[1:13:02] not a defeated people this afternoon
[1:13:04] we're not like people say well i don't i
[1:13:06] don't see all the miracles i don't i
[1:13:08] wonder if god's still present i wonder
[1:13:10] if he's still doing so let me declare to
[1:13:12] you this afternoon that god is still the
[1:13:14] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:13:17] still the same as he was when he was
[1:13:19] when he was when he stood by moses when
[1:13:20] he threw his rod down he's the same as
[1:13:23] he was when he stood by joshua when he
[1:13:25] crossed over the road the the jordan
[1:13:27] river he's still the same as he was when
[1:13:29] he stood by all those hebrews of the
[1:13:30] faith that stood by him
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:38] that's why brother abraham said with the
[1:13:39] same spirit of god in us that was in him
[1:13:42] we are more than conquerors with that
[1:13:44] same spirit of god in us
[1:13:46] that was in christ
[1:13:48] we are more than conquerors
[1:13:50] every gate has been conquered for us
[1:13:53] the only thing we have to do
[1:13:55] is possess it it's already conquered
[1:13:58] the only thing you have to do is just go
[1:14:00] get it
[1:14:01] go fight for it in other words go go
[1:14:04] apply the blood go stand believe it that
[1:14:07] doesn't mean see it doesn't mean that
[1:14:08] there's not going to be a battle there's
[1:14:09] going to be long nights in prayer long
[1:14:12] nights of study what do these things
[1:14:14] mean is the bible true is all these
[1:14:16] things are these kings correct how can i
[1:14:18] apply them in my life but when a gate
[1:14:20] stands before you it's already been
[1:14:22] conquered and all you have to do is go
[1:14:24] out and possess it
[1:14:25] he said if it's sickness you are more
[1:14:27] than a conqueror for it we are more than
[1:14:29] a conqueror and the seed of abraham
[1:14:31] shall possess the gate of the enemy when
[1:14:33] they say these things cannot happen when
[1:14:35] they want to call the devil or be
[1:14:37] elizabeth or something else god is sure
[1:14:39] to conquer every gate and take the enemy
[1:14:42] and that's why he said and thy seed
[1:14:44] shall possess the gate of his enemy what
[1:14:46] are we afraid about
[1:14:48] possess the gates
[1:14:49] we have god's promise
[1:14:51] we have his word we have his holy spirit
[1:14:54] the angels are kept about everything's
[1:14:57] in order every wall can be took down
[1:15:00] it's already took down the son of god
[1:15:03] goes before us his banners are waving
[1:15:05] and there's nothing can stand in the way
[1:15:07] of a saint going to meet a promise of
[1:15:08] god
[1:15:09] death can't stop it the grave can't stop
[1:15:12] it the devil can't stop it we are more
[1:15:15] than conquerors sickness is conquered

[1:15:31] great final seed of abraham there's no
[1:15:34] more conquering to do now he conquered

[1:15:38] the message he said all this whatever
[1:15:40] problem you have in life whatever thing
[1:15:43] that you're dealing with that you want
[1:15:44] to get rid of whatever it is it's

[1:16:18] possess the gates of the enemy
[1:16:20] and brother branham when he got to the
[1:16:22] end of this message he asked them the
[1:16:23] question what kind of a gate stands
