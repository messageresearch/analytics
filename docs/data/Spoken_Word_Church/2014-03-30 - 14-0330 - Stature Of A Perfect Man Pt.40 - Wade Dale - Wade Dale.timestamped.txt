[0:05] all right let's turn to Second Peter one
[0:08] and get back to where we were
[0:10] last Sunday
[0:12] in
[0:15] talking about the stature no statue
[0:18] statue is something that's solid and
[0:21] can't be moved this thing
[0:24] um
[0:25] God has always wanted to take out the
[0:27] Stony heart like he said in Ezekiel take
[0:29] the Stony heart and wine you can't take
[0:31] a stone once that Heart of Stone is set
[0:34] you can't do anything with it it's just
[0:37] there forever
[0:38] but if you take a heart of Flesh when he
[0:41] says I put a heart of Flesh in right see
[0:43] flesh is pliable so he can work with it
[0:46] Clay is pliable he can use it he can
[0:48] work with him all right
[0:50] second Peter 1 3.
[0:53] according as his divine power has given
[0:55] unto us all things that pertaineth unto
[0:57] life and godliness because the knowledge
[0:59] of him that have called us the glory and
[1:01] virtue
[1:02] poor buyer giving unto us exceeding not
[1:04] just little exceeding great impressive
[1:07] promises that by these you might be
[1:09] partakers of the divine nature so
[1:12] there's your way in
[1:13] right there's your way into the divine
[1:16] nature of God
[1:18] what
[1:19] about 500.
[1:22] and besides this giving all diligence
[1:24] add to your faith virtue virtue
[1:25] knowledge knowledge Temperance
[1:27] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:29] all right if it gets hot in here turn
[1:31] the fans on it again to get that kind of
[1:33] kind of weather and there's a lot of
[1:35] people in here too so but now we were
[1:38] talking about patience patience may be
[1:40] enduring continuance waiting
[1:45] constancy steadfast see that's what I
[1:48] look at
[1:49] I look at
[1:53] somebody's and you know you say well you
[1:56] don't judge people's life well it's like
[1:58] dad said he does have to throw the first
[2:00] stone we do as ministers judge
[2:03] because that's what you did you took
[2:05] things to the priest in the Old
[2:06] Testament and they judged it right so it
[2:09] shouldn't be something that we you know
[2:12] have a problem with if if you um my
[2:16] goodness gracious
[2:18] hey Katie come up here sit in front so
[2:21] we can get your picture
[2:22] I hope you've been here forever
[2:32] how you doing girl yeah you ever see you
[2:35] said you were coming to see us you
[2:36] talked to your line
[2:40] okay now for those who don't know this
[2:44] her name is Miss Katie sister Katie
[2:47] she's from Brother Homer Longoria's
[2:49] church
[2:50] just a minute does anybody remember
[2:53] Colleen Hurst that used to come here
[2:55] yeah well I do this is her name look at
[2:59] her oh yeah
[3:02] yeah sure do
[3:04] so she comes from Brother Homer's Church
[3:06] coming to visit so that's wonderful good
[3:08] to have you with us
[3:10] all right now what we were talking about
[3:13] was what we look at as ministers we look
[3:16] at the consistency
[3:18] we look at the perseverance of a person
[3:22] because like we've already said
[3:24] taking Hank and his wife for an example
[3:27] I've seen people come in here and this
[3:30] you have two
[3:32] this is the greatest thing since sliced
[3:34] bread this is most wonderful message
[3:36] this is the most wonderful dish the most
[3:37] wonderful that six months later they're
[3:39] gone that's right so it really didn't
[3:42] caught up they got caught up in the
[3:45] shouting the boys they got caught up in
[3:47] the shouting the trumpet but they never
[3:49] became
[3:50] the shout or the trumpet right
[3:53] and God was maybe on them but not in
[3:55] them
[3:56] because God can anoint you
[3:59] God can anoint a sinner to do something
[4:02] right God where's my law
[4:05] he said ever seen bring forth of his
[4:07] kind well sinners sinners have kids just
[4:09] like
[4:10] we do as Christians so God has to go by
[4:12] his law and even when a sinner has faith
[4:17] when a sinner has faith
[4:19] they get healed and they say well I must
[4:22] be of God well no that just means that
[4:24] you entered into a law that God said if
[4:26] you'll believe what I said I'll heal you
[4:28] what's wrong with you people were healed
[4:29] during the Beatles campaign when the
[4:31] Beatles came over across to the United
[4:32] States
[4:34] well they believed they believe that
[4:36] those men could touch God they had a
[4:38] perverted way of doing it
[4:40] but they believe that so when you have
[4:43] belief in faith Hey listen this was one
[4:45] I can't see
[4:47] brother Brandon would say a prostitute
[4:50] a
[4:53] they probably last Saturday night done
[4:56] her business
[4:58] but Sunday when he was preaching and
[5:00] called a prayer line they walk across
[5:02] the prayer line and they would get
[5:03] healed right
[5:05] and a Christian come across the pulpit
[5:07] and lose their healing
[5:10] why
[5:12] it was based on that prostitute said I
[5:16] believe what that man said right and God
[5:19] healed him a Christian walked up and
[5:20] said I believe what that man said but
[5:22] now I probably sin today or I probably
[5:24] did this right I got condemned her
[5:27] condemnation or for him their
[5:29] condemnation is what kept them from
[5:30] getting healed The Prostitute brother
[5:32] Brown wasn't condemning her for being a
[5:35] he was trying to get her body healed and
[5:38] then in turn God could save her soul and
[5:40] he's done that many times remember I um
[5:42] I can't remember her name but it's that
[5:44] uh girl he talks about all the time she
[5:46] was a drunk she was a prostitute now
[5:48] she's out testified of course that was
[5:50] back in the 60s but see God can wash you
[5:52] up God can clean you God can you know he
[5:54] can do that but it's just a law that God
[5:57] goes by then he said if you'll just
[5:59] believe me I'll do it that's right all
[6:01] right go Christian or non-Christian but
[6:03] when we like we were talking about in
[6:05] The Book of Psalms when when that when
[6:07] that God resides in you
[6:10] because see God can't dwell in an
[6:11] unclean vessel you can't help God inside
[6:13] of you and the devil inside of you at
[6:15] the same time
[6:16] all right that resides now you can have
[6:19] God in you and the devil will fight you
[6:20] he will come and fight but he cannot
[6:23] reside in that front in the Bible in
[6:25] Matthew it says that the unclean Spirit
[6:27] goes out we'll see when you go through
[6:29] justification when you go through
[6:30] sanctification when you're going through
[6:31] your Christian Journey the unclean
[6:33] spirits driven out of the man
[6:36] seek at the rest finest none walketh and
[6:38] drive places what there is a demon
[6:40] you're possessed by a demon I don't care
[6:42] what your name is
[6:44] there's demons that possess all of us
[6:46] right brother random said diabetes is a
[6:49] demon a blood-sucking demon now whether
[6:52] you're Christian or not that has nothing
[6:54] to do with it
[6:55] okay it's because a lot of people will
[6:58] say well because you're sick because
[7:00] you're not of God
[7:01] ain't got one thing doing it that's
[7:03] right I ain't got one thing to do with
[7:04] it amen you got to have faith right but
[7:07] God's healed the inside of man first
[7:09] right so that unclean Spirit leaves you
[7:13] and you feel good
[7:15] I did I felt wonderful I felt so empty
[7:17] and so I did I when I come out of that
[7:20] water and was baptized there in 1997 in
[7:23] December oh it was actually January the
[7:25] water was cold as ice
[7:26] but I was as warm as I could be I didn't
[7:29] feel nothing but just total emptiness
[7:31] why something had come out of me I had
[7:34] wanted to show the world that I had
[7:36] changed or that God had changed me
[7:39] all right and then when you come to that
[7:42] though you keep going through life and
[7:44] that's what happens to a lot of people
[7:45] they come in here they go anywhere they
[7:48] start going to church and they feel good
[7:49] and everything feels all right and they
[7:51] do get the unclean Spirit driven out of
[7:53] them but remember the Bible says you've
[7:55] got to fill it with something or that
[7:57] unclean spirit is going to come back
[7:59] amen and he's not going to come back
[8:01] alone right he's going to bring seven of
[8:04] his buddies
[8:05] worse than he was you know what worse is
[8:08] it's not that you if you had a drunk
[8:11] demon cast off of you that you're going
[8:13] to be eight times more drunk no he's
[8:15] going to bring his religious buddies
[8:16] this time
[8:18] he's going to make you feel religious
[8:20] that's the religious ones that come
[8:22] he brings his religious buddy it makes
[8:25] you feel religious
[8:27] see then all of a sudden you see the
[8:28] people go away
[8:30] you see people disappear well see they
[8:32] never got the Holy Ghost to fill that
[8:34] vessel that unclean spirit is going to
[8:37] try to come back
[8:38] but if it's filled with the Holy Ghost
[8:40] it can't get in there that's right it
[8:43] can't get in that inner man it can beat
[8:45] your memories and conscious and
[8:46] affection all the pieces but it cannot
[8:49] get inside that man so now that we have
[8:51] the Holy Ghost
[8:52] and God is working in our life not on
[8:55] our life in our life then we come to
[8:58] that what we just read there in in
[8:59] second Peter is now we have a we have a
[9:03] mandate from God not to just lay down
[9:07] we have a mandate from God all over the
[9:09] scriptures that he wasn't going to stop
[9:11] giving you promises just because he'd
[9:13] give you the divine nature of God when
[9:15] he give you the divine nature of God now
[9:16] listen you do have not two Natures but
[9:20] you do have a nature that bombards you
[9:22] and that's your old you
[9:24] remember it's it sure is dead but
[9:27] remember right up here is where we we
[9:28] resurrect
[9:30] we bring it out of the closet we let
[9:32] Satan do what he can do
[9:35] right that's right like bro Gary Atkins
[9:37] said which is a good point they're in
[9:39] Revelation 6.
[9:42] it's all right Revelations 5 it says
[9:44] that uh this Rider had a bow with no
[9:47] arrows well we know that the the prophet
[9:50] told us that was the devil not Jesus
[9:51] that's the devil because he was typing
[9:54] after Christ right but who in the world
[9:57] would go hunting with just a bow and no
[9:58] arrows who in the world would go bear
[9:59] hunting with a gun and no no bullets
[10:02] right you won't beat the thing to death
[10:04] he'll kill you
[10:06] but what we do is is we give that dude a
[10:09] pile of arrows to shoot right back at us
[10:11] we give him the ammunition that's right
[10:13] the shootout because of the things we do
[10:15] in our human life all right so with this
[10:18] statue of a perfect man we're we're not
[10:21] just trying to live a Christian Life
[10:22] we're trying to live an exemplary
[10:23] Christian Life not perfect you'll never
[10:26] be perfect
[10:27] but the Bible says be therefore perfect
[10:30] that's right
[10:31] so we must strive to that and that word
[10:34] perfect means complete now complete
[10:36] means that you have virgin but you have
[10:38] knowledge that you have Temperance did
[10:39] you have patience godlins brotherly
[10:41] kindness that's what we're talking about
[10:42] these are the virtues that work in your
[10:44] life and they're required they're
[10:46] required in this age to get us out of
[10:49] here
[10:51] I just heard brother Brandon say the
[10:53] other day though that you cannot
[10:56] just act that way you know I mean it's
[10:58] good a god-given thing right
[11:01] every one of these virtues
[11:03] are from God brother Brandon said in the
[11:05] Statue of perfect man he says there are
[11:07] people that have these virtues that are
[11:08] not born again
[11:11] I mean you didn't see people with a lot
[11:12] of patience but it's not godly patients
[11:14] right because somewhere they're going to
[11:16] fall off
[11:17] somewhere you'll fall off even as a
[11:20] Christian yes
[11:21] somewhere you're going to fall off
[11:23] brother Brown he'll say he'll say we get
[11:24] we you've got this far
[11:26] and you fall off you get up this far and
[11:28] you fall well you know what that's God
[11:30] showing you though that if you're three
[11:31] rungs up on a ladder
[11:33] you're not gonna fall all the way to the
[11:35] bottom you just don't have the
[11:37] temperance you need so that's where you
[11:39] need to work on them but you know what
[11:41] don't just say well I'm gonna keep
[11:43] having Temperance until I get patience
[11:45] no it's all a blending that's right it's
[11:48] all a blending work of God it's not
[11:50] something see that's why I don't like
[11:52] those lines on that
[11:54] now brother round two did this he put
[11:56] the line but that's just reference lines
[11:58] right I wish they'd turn them this way
[12:01] that's true because you got to have
[12:03] faith all the way up that's right you
[12:05] got to have virtue all the way out you
[12:07] gotta have knowledge all the way up
[12:08] Temperance patience all the way up you
[12:10] can't just say well now I got knowledge
[12:12] I don't need it anymore now I need to
[12:13] work it's not it's not like a it is a
[12:15] classroom thing but it's not a classroom
[12:18] where you where you learn
[12:20] one plus one is two
[12:22] and then two plus two is four
[12:25] four plus four is eight and you keep
[12:26] going like that but you do have to keep
[12:28] that as a basis though because you know
[12:30] what there's only
[12:31] there's only 10 numbers
[12:36] right all right
[12:38] all right nobody's saying amen
[12:40] there's zero one two three four five six
[12:43] seven eight nine there's no other
[12:46] numbers besides those
[12:49] that's true hello
[12:52] that's all
[12:54] you combine them together to make
[12:56] billions and trillions but there's only
[12:57] nine or ten numbers and zero is a number
[13:01] I don't care what they tell you you put
[13:04] a zero on in of a ten dollar bill what
[13:05] you got I know Hallelujah
[13:13] you put a zero on the end of a hundred
[13:16] dollar bill what you got wow
[13:19] I like what he said yeah
[13:26] but you see what I mean there's only 10
[13:29] numbers so
[13:30] that basis of learning those 10 numbers
[13:33] and then you combine them together same
[13:34] way with faith you have faith faith at
[13:37] the bottom of the pyramid that face is
[13:38] going to carry you all the way up to
[13:39] heaven
[13:40] you're not going to lose that Faker
[13:42] you're not going to come up to faith and
[13:43] be so full so you're running over with
[13:46] faith and there's no room for virtue and
[13:48] all you just it's just a gradual take
[13:50] what you got
[13:51] put it together and go up take what you
[13:53] got put it together and go up take what
[13:55] you got put it together and go up all
[13:56] right so that's what
[13:58] God's doing but you and I look in your
[14:02] patience
[14:04] possess you your souls right you're
[14:07] patient
[14:08] now listen
[14:09] the prophet of God made a statement one
[14:11] time and I I really think it was it was
[14:14] God speaking to us I know it was all God
[14:16] speaking to us but he said this is my
[14:17] eye right
[14:19] God give it to me
[14:21] so now it's mine now he wasn't making an
[14:24] illustration just for for filling up
[14:26] tape space purposes
[14:29] God gives you something to serve
[14:32] so add to your patience or in your
[14:35] patience when you've got patience it's
[14:37] yours when you get to Holy Ghost
[14:40] sure it come from God but whose is it
[14:42] it's yours because you're the one that
[14:45] works see God would just want you to
[14:47] just
[14:48] go all the way up to love when you get
[14:50] the new birth but that's not true he
[14:52] gives you that new birth and then you
[14:55] work with it that's right you got
[14:57] something to do with this thing that's
[14:58] right and then but you'll hear Brother
[15:00] REM say you don't have anything to do
[15:01] with you got to watch what he's saying
[15:03] what he's saying is is God saw you make
[15:06] a choice before the foundation of the
[15:07] world Amen
[15:09] and you're going to come to that because
[15:10] that's what he saw well you don't have a
[15:12] choice when it comes to that right
[15:14] that's right right but the reason you
[15:16] don't have a choice is because you made
[15:17] a choice that's right
[15:19] is that right is that right the reason
[15:22] you don't have a choice is God so you
[15:24] make a choice
[15:26] that's why he can preserve I love that
[15:28] scripture where he says God's preserved
[15:30] us
[15:31] you know preserved means
[15:33] Claude always told me this and it really
[15:35] stuck home you know you know you know
[15:36] what a cucumber is right yeah right
[15:38] cucumber is a cucumber
[15:41] but you take that cucumber
[15:44] put it in something you make a pickle
[15:46] out of it
[15:48] still looks like a cucumber
[15:51] still acts like a cucumber to a degree
[15:54] but it's now pickle
[15:56] there's no way it'll go back to a
[15:58] cucumber right it's always going to be a
[16:01] pickle because it's been put through the
[16:03] process well that's the same thing with
[16:04] you and I we go through a process we go
[16:06] through a pickling process so we're
[16:08] pickles
[16:09] we're just a bunch of old cucumbers that
[16:12] explains a lot we're just a bunch of old
[16:14] cucumbers being a cucumber
[16:18] is what you were born and that cucumber
[16:20] couldn't help itself be a cucumber
[16:23] but through a pickling process
[16:26] he become
[16:28] what he is now and he can never reverse
[16:30] and go back
[16:32] to being a cucumber again he's got to
[16:34] stay a pickle
[16:37] the the demons that come back
[16:40] when the Devil comes back to An Empty
[16:42] Soul a cleaned out Soul are they the
[16:45] things that God hates I've often
[16:48] wondered about that look all the things
[16:50] that God knows that's one of them yeah
[16:52] are they that would be closely related
[16:54] because it's almost the same number
[16:56] because religious people
[16:59] just be critical act like that yes they
[17:02] do
[17:03] that's true
[17:05] you'll think about that something else
[17:06] let's see you just keep it's like an
[17:07] onion peel you know you just keep
[17:08] peeling the onion peel them and they're
[17:10] just many layers of the message of the
[17:13] hour and the Bible but we're never going
[17:15] to get through with patience if we don't
[17:17] have a little patience here
[17:23] pickle
[17:25] that's right I don't I'm just not that
[17:28] don't mean I don't mean pickles like the
[17:31] world thinks pickled either
[17:33] laughs
[17:36] you always say if somebody was drunk
[17:38] they were pickles
[17:39] I want you drunk as long as you're drunk
[17:43] on new wine the Holy Ghost
[17:45] you get drunk on that see you won't have
[17:47] to ever drink again it's true
[17:49] because you get inside bro Joe Forney
[17:51] said he said man when I used to get
[17:52] drunk he said white man black man it
[17:54] didn't matter so we're just all friends
[17:56] he said when I get drunk on the Holy
[17:59] Ghost he said that same way we just all
[18:01] Brothers we're just all brothers and
[18:03] sisters so
[18:06] wine relaxes you
[18:09] but we're not into that
[18:11] wine junk either right
[18:14] okay all right listen let's read this
[18:16] right here
[18:18] uh Romans five and three right here and
[18:21] not only so but we glory in Tribulation
[18:24] we Glory
[18:26] knowing that tribulation work is
[18:28] patience
[18:31] and it's not finished
[18:33] and patience experience
[18:36] and experience hope amen so it's an
[18:41] ongoing process it's something that we
[18:44] have to go through
[18:46] you can't get around it people we've got
[18:49] to learn to have patience because in
[18:53] your patients possess you your souls now
[18:55] our soul is the most important thing yes
[18:58] amen amen whatever's in the soul is
[19:01] going to come out one other way or the
[19:02] other all right
[19:05] now let's go over let's
[19:08] let me skip some of this
[19:16] all right right here no wonder the
[19:18] church is so short this is Brother
[19:19] random and statue of a perfect man now
[19:22] one of the church is so short isn't that
[19:23] right no wonder I'd say repent be
[19:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[19:27] a strict trinitarian don't believe that
[19:29] says that oh Antichrist in Jesus name he
[19:31] says Jesus only Look Out Boy
[19:33] I don't know about your Temperance right
[19:35] now say why don't you come and say let's
[19:37] reason this together run around I like
[19:39] to talk
[19:40] I'd like to hear this explain see and
[19:43] come down and listen to it and then put
[19:44] it right before you and then you walk
[19:45] away well we'll get to that in just a
[19:48] few minutes and godlin is safe but when
[19:49] you fly loose you want to jump at every
[19:51] conclusion uh-huh that's that's not it
[19:54] say you haven't got Bible Temperance yet
[19:56] when you do that how to answer back then
[19:59] if you've got all this you can add this
[20:00] to your faith now here we're going
[20:02] fourthly you want to add patience to
[20:04] your faith if you've got faith it works
[20:06] as patient
[20:07] the Bible says see so this is patience
[20:09] now that's the next thing is going to
[20:11] build this stature you know God has got
[20:13] real material in his building
[20:15] see how short we are brother sister see
[20:17] see why where we're at yes sir see we
[20:20] have Glory we have shouts and things
[20:22] because we got faith but when we come
[20:25] down to these things here God can't
[20:27] build us into that stature see he can't
[20:30] he can't make us up to that kind of a
[20:32] place we got all these other things we
[20:35] fall slide off with it he can't build
[20:37] his church
[20:38] then he says patience with what kind of
[20:41] patience first thing is to have patience
[20:44] with God
[20:46] first thing patience with God all right
[20:50] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[20:52] have real genuine patience because Faith
[20:53] worketh patience When God says anything
[20:55] you believe it that's all you got a
[20:58] patient that's right just believe it all
[21:00] right
[21:02] because remember
[21:03] Abraham there's no way Abraham could
[21:06] produce a child at 100 years old that's
[21:08] right so he had to depend on God Amen so
[21:11] he just said God you said it so you're
[21:14] gonna have to do it see he tried to
[21:16] produce it later earlier in his life he
[21:18] could he could have children because
[21:19] because he had an Ishmael but once he
[21:21] got 100 years old and Sarah was 90
[21:24] there was no way they were going to have
[21:26] kids unless God came on the scene and
[21:28] changed their body so Abraham can't
[21:30] change his body you and I can't change
[21:32] our body we can bring our body under
[21:34] subjection see that's the key you bring
[21:37] your body under subjection because of
[21:39] what's inside of you this is the control
[21:41] tower right
[21:43] inside the soul the Persona the real you
[21:46] all right
[21:47] God told Abraham 25 years later there
[21:51] wasn't even one sign actually it got
[21:52] worse that's right
[21:55] it's not suggested there was no sign you
[21:58] got worse that's right
[22:00] if you know what I mean yes right he was
[22:03] still believing he was patient with God
[22:05] uh-huh
[22:07] put him always before you let him be the
[22:09] next Crossing thing you can't cross him
[22:11] so just keep him before you he said so
[22:13] and it's going to happen
[22:15] that's right Noah had patience yep no
[22:18] one had real Godly patience
[22:20] God said I'm going to destroy the world
[22:22] with rain remember people it had never
[22:24] rained right
[22:28] it had never rained since the beginning
[22:30] of time it's been 2 000 years since Adam
[22:33] to Noah it has not ran one drop all the
[22:37] water read the Bible
[22:39] the water was coming up out of the
[22:40] ground as a Mist that kept everything
[22:42] water and then you had your rivers and
[22:44] all that but there was no clouds there
[22:45] was no there was atmosphere but there
[22:47] was no rain there was nothing to produce
[22:49] rain
[22:49] so here's Noah
[22:52] and he preached for 120 years
[22:55] the same message
[22:57] it's gonna rain
[23:01] plenty of patients the prophet said not
[23:03] even do fell from heaven wasn't nothing
[23:05] just as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120
[23:08] years when he was patient then God tries
[23:10] your patience
[23:12] that's right God tries them after he
[23:14] told no one I know I want you to go
[23:15] ahead and get in the yard remember he
[23:16] went in the yard and God shut the door
[23:17] well it was still seven days he was in
[23:19] that art before it started raining all
[23:21] right I'm gonna run the animals in I
[23:23] want you to get in climb way upstairs
[23:24] now so you can look out the top window
[23:26] now I want you to get in there I want
[23:28] you to tell these people tomorrow what
[23:30] I've been preaching for 120 years is
[23:32] going to take place all right you go
[23:33] down there and tell them
[23:35] then remember what happened it didn't
[23:37] rain until the seventh day but when you
[23:40] know what it happened
[23:43] it happened flood came destroyed
[23:45] everybody but the eight people in the
[23:47] ark yes and for all of you information
[23:49] Gina and I went and watched that New
[23:51] Normal movie last night I wouldn't waste
[23:53] my time
[23:58] it's a good drama it's a good action
[24:01] movie but foreign
[24:07] the only thing that was really
[24:09] scriptural about it is is the is it
[24:11] didn't it started drizzling around a
[24:12] little bit but then The Fountains of the
[24:14] deep like the Bible says there was a big
[24:17] plumes of water come shooting up out of
[24:19] the ground because that's what destroyed
[24:20] the Earth
[24:21] surprise surprise 40 days of rain won't
[24:24] destroy the Earth
[24:25] right that's right no it wasn't him
[24:30] really really it just rained That's
[24:32] right The Fountains of the deep opened
[24:34] up the Bible says there was there was
[24:35] aqueducts Under the Ground full of water
[24:37] and God turned them thing off actually
[24:39] you know what happened remember what the
[24:41] prophet said
[24:42] man destroys himself always that's right
[24:45] so I believe it was an atomic explosion
[24:47] I believe because it was in the days of
[24:48] Noah so shall be in the days of the son
[24:50] of man well if if we're this Advanced
[24:52] now
[24:54] they were that advanced or more back
[24:56] then right
[24:58] I can see why that that civilizations
[25:01] turned upside down and all because God
[25:03] they destroyed their self by either an
[25:06] economic explosion or something went off
[25:07] and it caused those fountains to open up
[25:10] and that's what filled the world with
[25:12] water knocked 40 days and 40 nights of
[25:14] rain and and let me give you another
[25:16] secret they weren't in the ark just 40
[25:18] days either
[25:20] they were in the ark a year a month and
[25:23] so many days they were in there 13
[25:25] months in that art that's right
[25:28] okay
[25:30] so we don't read our Bible right every
[25:32] once in a while we read it when we hear
[25:34] the story of Noah and the flood in 40
[25:36] days and it rained and then it quit and
[25:38] then it got out and then you know it
[25:41] ain't exactly all that went on
[25:43] so anyway but don't waste your time
[25:45] going to see it unless you just want to
[25:47] see an action movie
[25:48] and uh
[25:51] got some pretty good points in it
[25:53] sometimes but something to make you
[25:54] think but still it was I wouldn't go see
[25:57] it again ever
[25:59] nothing wrong with it I mean we didn't
[26:01] have there was no you know a little bit
[26:02] of violence but and and
[26:05] but they talked about the Creator and
[26:06] they talked about things you know they
[26:07] never called in God they always call
[26:09] them Creator and stuff like that so but
[26:11] no one had patience this guy preached
[26:14] for 120 years
[26:17] that's a long time and there was no
[26:19] scientific evidence that it was going to
[26:21] happen if they were as advanced then as
[26:24] we are now I just said that that's what
[26:25] the Bible said they were as advanced as
[26:27] we are here then they could shoot the
[26:30] Stars the moon anywhere they could see
[26:32] there's no moisture nowhere except in
[26:34] the ground right and here's Noah
[26:37] preaching against the whole scientific
[26:40] age that they were in
[26:43] they remember only eight people made it
[26:45] that's right
[26:47] and one of them was the devil Pam
[26:51] remember ham what ham did I know the
[26:53] scripture says so that God divided the
[26:55] waters between the firm
[26:58] Ness so he put water it's up there yeah
[27:00] that was just she just didn't know it
[27:02] right that was just what he done he just
[27:04] hit it all in the clouds and everything
[27:05] they just didn't have anything to see
[27:07] any moisture that was gonna I
[27:10] sure but they thought this ain't gonna
[27:12] destroy the world it never has before if
[27:14] it rains a little bit so what big deal
[27:17] but they didn't know that what was under
[27:18] was what was going to kill her right
[27:20] same way with man now what's under us is
[27:23] what's going to kill them that's right
[27:24] got it yes all right
[27:27] I don't know how I got off on that but
[27:29] brother Brandon said it would be
[27:30] volcanic so that's underneath that's
[27:32] underneath coming out
[27:34] yep
[27:36] all right remember but if you ain't got
[27:38] that no way don't try to add it in other
[27:39] words talking about nowhere it won't
[27:41] work it won't work on healing it won't
[27:43] work on nothing else it's got to blend
[27:45] in with the same materialist vulcanized
[27:47] to that's right got to add it patience
[27:50] with God's promise yes sir Noah believed
[27:52] it and he had patience with God 120
[27:54] years Moses had patience with God yes
[27:57] sir Moses I've heard the Cry of my
[27:59] people
[28:00] seen their Affliction I'm coming down to
[28:02] the liver I'm going to send you down
[28:03] and a little contrast there between him
[28:05] and God God showed him his glorious and
[28:07] here I go when he once seen the glory of
[28:09] God you're saying he had Faith what's
[28:11] that in your hand Moses a stick throw it
[28:12] down
[28:13] turn into a serpent oh my take it up
[28:15] Moses if I'm able to carry the snake and
[28:17] turn it back
[28:18] ah brother Brown claps his hand three
[28:20] times amen if God can give me a natural
[28:23] life he can give me a spiritual life I
[28:25] believe he got a little Revelation here
[28:26] got a little happy
[28:29] if God can give you the first birth
[28:31] he can give you the second part
[28:34] amen if God can heal this by Divine
[28:36] Healing he can raise it up I'm sure he's
[28:38] pointing to this
[28:39] if God can heal this by Divine Healing
[28:42] he can raise it up again to his glory in
[28:44] the last days oh my oh that's right
[28:46] Moses said you know when I layered on
[28:48] that Foundation there was patience laid
[28:50] on there so I'll just wait and see what
[28:51] God will do there the old serpents was
[28:53] crawling around blowing hissing at one
[28:55] another first thing you know Moses
[28:56] serpent went go go go remember Janice
[28:59] and Jennifer's through through there
[29:00] sticks down and turned him in the
[29:02] surface yeah but Moses the snake eat
[29:04] their snake
[29:06] you know what Moses carried him around
[29:08] the whole time
[29:10] he carried him three snakes around in
[29:12] his or two snakes around in his Cane the
[29:14] whole time he was he took him to the
[29:15] promised land or not promised land but
[29:17] he took him up to the door of the
[29:18] Promised Land
