and that's for you to have the preeminence in all of our hearts and our lives for us to be what you want us to be for us lord to just commit ourselves to you and to just walk up right in your love and

operated on because we don't worry about it we know who the healer is irregardless of which way you want it to be done we ask you now to guide and bless in the service open the eyes of our hearts as we sing unto you lord that we may see you living among us in jesus name amen hebrews 11 1-2 then we'll go to verse 8. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report all right now what are we doing taking the reports that they gave verse eight by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which you should actually receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the tabernacles of isaac and jacob the heirs of with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundation whose builder and maker is god you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we covered in doing you know sunday about we were talking about abraham's journey and uh trying to pick up the things you know in all of that and tonight we want to talk about our journey the bringing it down more because what have we been dealing with we've been talking ever since we started on this series 22 messages ago were talking about a positive attitude and that anybody in the bible had ever amounted to anybody anything had a positive attitude and they had a contact with the god of that word you know they they had personal personal experience and i've kept on asking you and i the question have we had a personal experience and and not to just talk about somebody else's experience but to talk about our own experiences in in in god and and doing that then because it's personal to you and i and uh remember there's only one uh moses there was only one noah there was only one enoch you know and they had their part that they fulfilled in their lives and they're doing you know so you know and realize that my point is what if what if it is for us or to you for god to give you something that's personal to you now he even said it like this one time talking about a preacher he said god could train you 40 years to give you a 30-minute sermon well i'm just hoping sometime somewhere out of this 40 something years that i've been preaching that i've got at least a 15-minute sermon out of it anyway you know and got to to go on with the lord and uh you know to understand but you know paul speaks of abraham as we were talking about sunday as being the father of us all so we covered that he was the father of the jews he was the father of what would be known as the arabs or whatever you want to call them the gentiles and things and knowing that we're that abraham himself was was not a jew because that word jew didn't come along until later on in the scripture you know over into jude before it ever appears in esther all right and uh in that then abraham had a journey that if you and i will look at it we'd understand why brother branham would say on who is this melchizedek progress 64-66 said every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing every son of the faith will take the same journey that abraham took abraham's journey was laid out there in the scripture remember and they lived it for an example you and i and they they didn't really know uh what they were doing you know in doing that uh josh uh we i viewed one of her message the other day and boost us up a little because you all have to correct that between the two of yous but we had to very well run the volume out to be able to do and some here say is that you know that when i get down and slow and going down they don't hear me real well so pull it up you know until where that it don't kill the eardrums or the ones that can hear good but also allow the ones that you know can't hear for them to be able to hear of what we're doing and and it'll keep it in that line all right now so if ever son of the faith we claim to be the seed of abraham by faith we claim to be the children of god all right that's fine but where are the children of abraham by faith by revelation for god to reveal himself to us and showing us who we are all right now then we don't have to worry about it see we we used to think well we're here we believe god's using us we believe you know this that or the other but we really don't know exactly what we're here for or maybe we don't you know follow it and don't look at it like that well then why not go back into the bible and that's what i've been trying to do is to get us to take the ones in the scriptures who went through things for our examples all right then we can follow that and see what is coming next all right so then we can go through the things in the life of abraham and and i'll just skip some of it because wade done a good job on what he was bringing but i just want to hit a little bit because looking at his life it's exactly showing what we are and where we are right now and what the next thing is all right the next thing is the change of the body see and abraham went through those things all right in his journey but now remember of the story his name is not abraham to start with it's abram all right now the covenant the promise now listen very carefully it was not made with abraham that's a way over in his journey the covenant the promises and all was made with abram see we want to take and pull up a little bit slide away from off of this way don't know how to undo him but we got abraham we're we're the seat of abraham we just remember what the journey he went through is the same journey we're going to go through if we're the seed of abraham if the prophet's right and we believe it that he said every son of the faith would go through the same journey that abraham did all right now see we want to get on to the silly parts and and the things but it does fit in but we don't want to go out and give our wife away and do this out of the other it's what i say we're uh that's what i talk about sunday we become too educated you know us educated idiots uh we like to show how smart we are when we're really showing how dumb we are all right but think about it now abram you know that the covenant was made with abram do you know that that comes over to a way into the journey before his name is changed to abraham well see then we're dealing with abram all right and in that he meets god many times in his journey and those things in the way he meets god we by way of the prophet we take those things and relate them to our journey we say genesis 12 abram come through justification we say genesis 15 abram comes through sanctification because of the things that are happening there and in genesis 17 he finally receives the baptism of the holy ghost and he's still abram see we're trying to make it some split condition to try to get away from these things but my point is is that in my journey as a christian i remember meeting god well brother dale i've never met god are you born again well you met him somewhere okay it's time to wake up and start thinking about really where we're standing and what we've done and where we're at you know in doing in our life and our journey what do you think happened to you at justification or where you first repented oh if i was like abram if i was like abraham and god had talked to me who called you to repent who called you to clean up your life who called you to a new birth but yet we don't believe that god is speaking to us like he's speaking to these people that we can read of and we say if we were only like that look back through your life that's the thing i'm trying to get us to do look back through your christian journey that when you first repented and when you first asked god to forgive your sins the bible said the goodness of god calleth thee to repentance all right now you didn't do something good to get him to call you abraham was a gentile abram was he was a gentile from the the land there what it chaldees the era of chinese all right and he was he was a gentile he was just an ordinary person he wasn't a super-duper uh thing he was just an ordinary person and god came down and spoke to it and like i've said to you many times see we want to make it a predestinated and and oh we got to get everything involved in it but i wonder how many people talked that god talked to even in the days of abram we went through that he talked with cain as well as abel but see we we got it all we think we've got it all figured out we got into the message and again get begin to get a little uh intellectualism into our thinking and we think we've got it all figured out but abram was a gentile lord spoke to him and said get out of this country go to a land i'm not going to tell you where it's at you just journey and when i decide to let you know about it i'll let you know right so he starts on a journey and immediately that was right at the beginning of genesis 12. immediately about the seventh verse of 12th chapter the lord appears to brother tell you mean do you think that that god would appear to us at justification well what do you think happened i'm serious but we don't look at it that way we think we repented we think we tried to clean ourselves up and don't think that god was making contact with us and talking to us but god don't talk to nobody but the prophets where's that in the bible where is it brother brown's message well i don't want it then all right but you see church we're not taking it as for what it is god called you to repentance all right we can read about it in abraham of how that but all of it in abraham was it it doesn't really show a great big amount of things except one thing abraham gets up and he starts walking you know it's not even recorded that abraham cried and went through a whole lot of things at his justification but yet if we don't have some form of emotionalism parts to us we don't want to credit that as being authentic well you're right in the middle of the devil's trout do you that's the best way to say it you order by now at least begin to realize that you can't depend upon anything but god's word and god's word said that he spoke to abram get up leave and go all right he starts on his travel on his journey he meets him in chapter 12 verse 7. it was good enough for him to call him and tell him to come out but it's the bible art said the lord appeared unto abram and remember he's just a repentant sinner as we'd type it today and we would top it to our journey you don't remember god talking to you you know speaking to you no we think all of that is us all right but look we get on over in the 13th chapter and it says the lord spake abraham he's still this abram 14th chapter he hasn't even come to sanctification yet and he meets melchizedek come on i wasn't the one that told the story i wasn't the one that wrote the book so don't get upset with me about it think about what's being said do you understand what i mean by that wrote around and said ever seed of the faith would take the same journey that abraham took all right so when are we going to settle down with that and say okay let me read what happened to him you don't remember when you first repented see i was 18 years old so that puts me more in a category wife and i were married you know and that puts me in a category of more of a remembrance i guess than maybe you in your younger years of 10 12 years old or something when you repented you know in the things in your your first repentance but you can remember when you repented don't you you remember something happened to you don't you you remember a change come in your life don't you well what caused that well i just decided to be better no god come down and begin to contact you at justification moving on into sanctification the 15th chapter but he's done met him if you're listening to what i'm talking about genesis 12 it's the lord spoke to him 12 7 the lord appeared unto him 13 14 the lord spake to abram 14th chapter of genesis in 18 he met melchizedek the king of salem and he ain't even got the sanctification yet all right 15th chapter where we talk about him being sanctification meets the lord the covenant is made in the 15th chapter of the animals and the thing remember he's still abram right he's still abram he's not changed abraham all right he's still abram but yet he's done met god about four times but yet can you talk about your experience of where you started as a christian and what god has been doing with you and how he led you through these things you don't remember that you joined a church but yet after a while you just wasn't satisfied at that so you maybe moved to another church some of us like me wound up being deacons just sanctification being sunday school teachers training union directors is sanctification you see if you ever get that down you'll understand why brother dale can be like he is if you just realize your own journey mr hazelfanboy has played the piano for 17 years about i don't know exactly how many years of that and she was still smoking i ain't let no woman smoking be a okay it's not your church okay so don't worry about it just call me an unbeliever do what you want to because you see i remember where i came from that's the hardest thing in the message ain't it because people boy they well bless god i've seen that first time it was said i've seen it and i'm sorry i got too good of a members of remembrance some of you it took me six months to a year to get you to see one god you done got baptized and but you see church we don't think about the contact that god has made with us do you mean he would actually contact a man back there that is not coming to the basis of redemption in being the the uh becoming a family of god or the children of god and he'd be more personal to him than he would to you see church it's time to get rid of churchiology well i'm in the message what else do you want you know but you see abram comes to meet god in chapter 15. and it's on over later the 17th chapter that the prophet covers it that that that would be the baptism of the holy ghost what about it seemingly that he appeared to abram more in the beginning of his journey as to even meeting melchizedek and fed him to caif into different things and then later on his contacts don't seem to be as strong with him in personal things but we just go to church we're all right brother dale i just i just one day i just i just said lord forgive me and i just walked in church and i've been there ever since and and you know i really don't know when i got saved well then you're not saved that's the best way to say it i had a definite experience of justification i didn't know that was what it was what about you i had a definite experience at sanctification i didn't know that was what it was but what about you can you talk about can you preach your your experience from the bible if you can't then maybe you haven't had the experience but see a lot of times we've had experiences but we didn't know that was what it was right we didn't know that was god dealing with us that said go to this church stay there a little while leave that go to this church go in here go in there searching talking to people but we don't count that as god dealing with us so then if we're going to do as the prophet said abraham in his journey was a type of the pure pure believer then we go to justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost i said i had a definite experience of a time of justification i had a definite experience of a time of a cleansing within my life and a definite experience for the baptism in the holy ghost not to just say i believe the message not even because i've seen angels not even because i've seen the lord in a church when i was 12 years old i never put none of that there but how many of you have ever had an experience of justification have you ever repented of your sins and felt a great big load go off of you no i just went to church well you need to get an altar have you ever had a time when something began to deal with you and say you're not supposed to be living like that you know if you're going to be a christian you are not be living that way but what are you going to call that so you can be going through the journey and actually having experiences but then not knowing what it is and not being taught because they never taught us those ways and we don't really know what was going on then when i talk about the baptism of the holy ghost as being the person the prophet says of jesus christ coming and living in you well now brother dale lattice i don't know about that i'm just i'm just i just do the best i can i just but you see if you haven't come through that you don't have the new birth abram gets a name change right type in a new birth bringing it right in relating in 17 and 18 both of them together you know that brother random said when you become a christian you get a name change you remember that he said what you used to be was sinner said now you're a christian but you don't count that as a part of your journey and here we come to the message of the hour and we're in the message of the hour but yet we don't count that as an experience and i didn't say coming in the message an hour was the experience of the holy ghost as a new birth because i never taught it that away but it's an experience it's part of my journey i love to hear you tell your journey no matter what you call how simple it is are unimportant i like to hear your testimony about how god has directed you you know there might be a lot of things in our lives that could be major things that we didn't even think about it being it we thought it was just a happening you know the person you marry the the church you go to the the things of life that can all be connected into your experience i'm talking about our journey now we talked about abraham's journey sunday in the two of the things in relation and i want it to be personal to me and you tonight you know to think about what we have went through to come to where we are now right honestly now think of it look what you gave up to come into this message positions things in other churches the right to just be any way you want to and live like the devil and still go to heaven when you die because that's what they taught you and yet you come into a message that is hard on the human flesh because the flesh is having to be brought under subjection that was never taught to us by other churches irregardless you know the best they could do they never taught anything in the relationship of coming to a change of the body because everybody come along with the idea we're going to get a new one what do you need to change for it you're going to get a new one right right well worry about this whole body smoke him cigarettes because this body here is not going it's gonna die it's gonna go to the ground can you put your journey in the bible and you relate yourself to anyone in the scriptures and the best thing to start off is a doubt in thomas right it's the best place to start but that's where we all started in a journey a journey to bring us to be the children of god what about the things that happened in this journey could you say you met god come on i'm serious i'm can you go back in your life and think about where you came from and what you've done and how you lived and what was going on well why can't we do that he wasn't concerned with god when you were little i was very concerned but don't even count that as salvation though after i found out what it was but you know what that's part of my journey and i'm glad to tell you my journey but yet people thinks that you think you're exalted or some kind of a prophet or something because you can say that you saw god when you was about 10 11 years old standing in a church what about it didn't something leads you something call you to repentance call you to a clean life and didn't it call you to the end time message or is it because your wife's in the message your husband's in the messenger or anytime something or whatever daddy mama was when you do it that way you won't last long but when you get something personal i'm talking about our journey and before abram gets over to a lot of things has happened in the man's life that he was in contact personal contact with almighty god we can see truly if we go back in genesis 15 through 17. and see as i said the covenant was made with abram that's why paul comes along later maybe you don't follow him when he says when was it made it was made when abraham was in circumcision or before circumcision he said the covenant with covenant was made before circumcision circumcision is an outward manifestation of the fact that something has taken place but what do you think have you ever really repented you know just ask god to forgive you and really mean it from the bottom of your heart and really labor in the basis of trying to do the best we can living it's not a hard thing to do you know yeah but if i become a christian i just have to give up too much no what are you giving up giving up the world which is killing you destroying you that's where i was going to go on and into sarah and her journey we're gonna maybe be a little surprised when we get into the next one because we want to beat on sarah real hard but you know what there was a time come so you come to the right place that's what i'm trying to get me and you too the abram got a name change and made him abraham he appears to him talks with him tells him throughout that journey you're going to have a child abram he misunderstands because he doesn't get it right he said the disciple might walk before you and even after he gets a change of the body you know he's made young again i want to separate that in a second even after his body is made young again he turns around gives his wife away the second time why because he wasn't a born-again believer right he was scared to death he gives his wife away twice you remember back over in the in about the 12th chapter somewhere in there sarah was 65 years old i remember calculating that up one time getting it down to see and she's 65 years old and that's when the first time that abraham was going to give her away she must have been a beautiful woman because she was already 65. well they just lived longer back there days is the same 24 hours you know still the same but yet it comes over later and he's turned back to a young man and he's still scared to death about his neck and his own doing do we get sarah to lie to the king that's my sister and well it wasn't technically alive so that makes it the worst technically that was his sister but that's the worst lie right a little bitty live worse than great bigger all right but think about it now abram finally through what god does and that's why he put him to sleep he took him out of the way he made all of the covenant everything abraham didn't have anything to do with it he's totally asleep all he's got to do is wake up and start walking well i wonder how many times god spoke to you and i in our journey but we didn't understand it i walked out of that baptist church because i knew i had to leave there was no choice it wouldn't that they didn't run me off and i walked out i went home that night and i got in my old barbecue pit out in the back of the house and said when the lord i really have messed everything up now because there's just no way back and i'm sorry that i've messed it up so now you're gonna have to come make something out of what's here because there's no way for me to go back there's nothing else i can't do because i believe you i believe you spoke to me and you call me you believe that god spoke to you and called you to repentance see then getting something personal a positive attitude about your experience trying to relate it to you as uh some things we can talk about that happened in your life and see i don't even count as i told you i don't count the fact that i saw an angel or i saw the lord when i was 10 11 years old i don't count that to new birth you say well boy that would be a great thing for me to talk about i don't count it that way because i know how i lived after then and i know when he stopped me the second time when i was 18 years old i know i had that contact with him what does he look like that's what everybody wants to know but how many of you have ever had an experience that you can talk about not because you quit drinking and smoking running around with women remember that's under sanctification justification is just chopping off your past sins and dealing with that sanctification starts dealing with the unclean spirit going out well i didn't know that had to be that way i just thought i just believed it and got it no that don't exactly work abraham didn't do that he had experiences he met god over and over throughout his experience do you realize what i mean by when he gets over the earth and meets melchizedek in the 14th chapter he meets melchizedek and brother brown said that was almighty god and he's still not born again you see we want to count our experiences in our life to make them our born-again experience well see i would be justified in saying that i seen god i'd be just if i didn't say it i've seen an angel three times in my home but i count none of that to do with my salvation maybe god let that happen to me where i can talk to you about it to keep you from building it on some form of fanaticism you know i'd rather have just a slow day by day walk in my christian journey that i just keep moving on and i keep climbing higher and higher i'd rather have that than all the great experiences that you can speak of because satan can impersonate every one of your experiences but he can't walk day by day in the word so i'd rather have the word being revealed to me and in finding out that we're talking about faith being a substance the substance is a revelation and that's why i keep asking you has god revealed anything to you something that nobody can't take away from you something that can't be explained away something personal to you you can go through a lot of things like wade did and you get an abraham and savior and the name changes excuse me and all kind of things but my main point is for you and i to check in abraham's life of how many times god came down and met with the man in his journey how many times has he guided you and directed you some of you that are from overseas in different countries you know and poor old sister milka her mama and daddy sent her over here to get her away from the message right that's the reason he's laughing probably on the internet now about it they sent her over here to a missionary's home to get her away from the message and she gets a job and a lady she's working inside of as a believer in the message invites her to go to church right well yet all the way over here i've lived and talked with her about it and she agrees i said all the way over here you just crying lord i've been trying to follow the truth i was following the word and now you let my family just pick me up and dumped me to where i don't even have a family i don't have nothing and all the time he's just leading her right into the word she asked this lady and the lady says yeah but same lady says there's another church too if you'd like to go so she comes up here and you know what she's been here ever since what about it sister trudy we say black trudy white trudy i hope everybody on the internet don't get that messed up in their mind that's the only way we can keep up with trudy macmillan and trudy you know but what about it trudy cassandra what about it where'd you come from how did you get over here somebody introduces her to the message right how do we get where we're at oh brother anderson he was out there in california doing great and just gets a contact why can't we think about our journey of life and think about it in a wonderful way and realize what god has been doing to bring us to where we are right now and thinking about how greater could he have done and bringing us down to the end time to were that abraham done one more thing now we've got to get our story correct so i want you to follow me for a second abraham and sarah were turned back young we use the word change brother random uses the word changed that's all right but they were really not changed they were reversed from being old right the process of them aging reversed and they wound up back a young man and a young woman because they never got the change that you and i are going to get but they spoke of it because they never got the new birth that they spoke of but we got it right and see then it comes down to where we're at are we just wanting to be young again or do we want what god wants what about it i just want to read these couples about three quotes to think on this point go ahead brother and start with getting in the spirit 1961 428 you're on abraham's yep i got the other way because that that would be e49 we're on over on number three come up to number three okay we get it right e15 getting in the spirit now watch he's talking about changing the moment the twink of an eye i want you to listen to his reading because we know this but i want you to listen to his reading and then make the point see what we're talking about all right and we'll have to have a changed body now sarah and abraham in that kind of a body turn back young now listen could not receive the promised son watch him now they were 100 years old couldn't receive it that way but when they're chained when they're pulled back to a young person they still can't do it there's a difference in being turned back to young and being changed but yet the word is interchangeable so do all right but now what abraham and sarah in that kind of a body old people could not receive the promised son they were 100 years old he had to change their body not turn them back so much as to young which he did but also changed them because they'd been like they was at they they'd been like they was at the first place you understand you understand what he's explaining if god turned them back to young man and a young woman they couldn't have children when they were a young man a young woman right they lived together all her life did not know children if he put them back young so we had to change them so we won't just want don't want to be young again we want to be changed right and he changed their body in such a way that they could receive the sun right so they couldn't get the sun up here right that they could receive the son and now we find the next thing in order for the church now is a changed body not us old people go back and be young so much but we will and we will be there young just as certain but we got to have a changed body in order to receive the sun because we're going to meet him in the air we're going to meet the sun in the earth right rapture will come a change in a moment the twinkling of an eye all right so now what's he explaining so he goes on again and abraham and his seat after him whatever number four he 95 so and look what if he just turned them back to a young man than a young woman like there was at the first place they couldn't have had the baby in they couldn't have had the baby anyhow because they lived together when they was young man and woman he had to change their body in a different way in order to receive get the son a different way than just being going back to being young right is that right their body had to be changed in another way they'd received the son and we cannot if we would go back to be young men and women we still can't meet the son because we're going to meet him in the air we've got to have a changed body to meet in the air the rapture art are you listening one more this is off the message true easter seal paragraph 143 now watch as he said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now you ought to see what the connection the son of man is going to have to change there ain't going to be no change if the son of man didn't come if this message is not right there's no change of the body right it's all related to whether the message is right or not all right we see that taking place right now what was the next thing to change the body now show that this we are looking for an expected son glory is that right we cannot meet him in these bodies if we are changed back to young men and women still we can't meet him because we have to meet him in the air all right now what's the point in a second now that's why it's it's the word caught up there had to be something done besides change us there has to be something done besides change us back to young men and women we've got to be changed and caught up in the air to meet him and the next thing coming is the rapture of the church and the change of the body of the sleeping saints to meet the lord jesus in the air now think about it that's why it says caught up it doesn't say rapture because it's not in there it's caught up and even though you and i could be made young we can't go to meet the lord in the air at that point if everybody in the world was made young right now we still couldn't meet him in the air why because abraham and sarah doesn't show that abraham and sarah couldn't have any children when they were young and married and when he got they got old and he turned them back to being young they couldn't have any children then the change come this message is to bring you and i to a change to meet the promised son we've got to meet him in the hour now let's go for the lice when i'll be through look what he said on for abraham and his seed after him paragraph e96 we read 95 while ago it's a very short one so look at it number six brother are we looking for the sun what kind of sun are we looking for what kind of a sun are we looking for the son of god rising with healings in his wings there's your body turned back young we're looking for we're going to meet the sun and the earth right he doesn't come here so we're not having to worry about looking at are we looking for the sun what kind of a sun are we looking for the son of god rising with healing in his wings hallelujah abraham and his seed after him do you understand you follow what i'm saying we are going to have to have be made young yeah but that wouldn't qualify us because we're going to meet the sun in the air it's the sun of righteousness that rises with healings in his wings and i thought that was to be in you and i i mean that's my understanding if i've missed it i'd like to know that the son of righteous riding with healing his wing was a healing campaign went out in the last days for the son of man i remember the son of man the son of man is related down to the change then all right see the son of man was the sign of the resurrection are you with me the son of man see that's why jesus was the son of man brother branham was a son of man that the son of man manifested himself through and that the son of man is the sign of the messiah but if random had the son of the messiah i mean sign of the messiah which was the discernments in the things but it went further than just discernment it went on to the raising of the dead right the son of righteousness uh malachi says will rise with healings in his wings the prophet says we can't meet that son we've got to be changed before we go there we said what kind of a sun are we looking for we're not leaving off the earth and then be changed we're going to be changed here not just made young you remember what i said a while ago see then abraham in his typing could go so far and you can speak but you've got to stop because abraham and sarah now listen to the wording they were made young but they were not changed as we must be they were made young right but they both wound up getting old and dying right but you see you're not when we come to that turn back then we're changed to go meet the lord in the air there ain't going to be no starting over again one says you changed in a moment of twinkling of an eye we're going to go meet the literal lord jesus in the sky right but if the sun of righteousness don't rise with healing in his wings and you and i because of the message the prophet has brought us we know right where we're standing there's not going to be another prophet with signs and wonders because there's no examples in the bible it's the change it's the son of righteousness to rise in you and i a great healing campaign right is that the way the prophet said son of righteousness right great healing campaign but he said this is a special healing in other words this is a change of the body not just made young can we go right back and do again what we used to do it would be even worse you think oh if i was just young what i could do if you was young you'd turn back young and lust and everything else abraham and sarah did he's not listed as much of sarah but abraham went over and married another woman had about seven kids fire sarah died pretty quick but listen folks our journey we look at abraham's journey we see abraham's journey is to just show us the journey we take that's what as far as an example to show us the rising of the sun go get that message down listen to it it's rising of the sun that son of righteousness is rising now with healings in his wings that's why i've always encouraged you about healing and things instead of being like all these other brothers seemingly well we don't we just don't have what they had we just don't have what was back there we just don't have one here and i know i always get in trouble because i explain it but you take the faith of the fathers you take peter in them and stand them here today under the situation we're under and let's see what would take place that's not justifying nothing that's a god's honest truth brother branham come back and start around the country in a healing campaign do you think there would be a lot of people that want to hear him no no because the day's gone it's finished we're in the cooling off the coasting but the greatest thing that could ever be is among us today they're getting you and i to a place that we can be changed this message is what's doing it what do you think i've been preaching on see has not it been the whole point to you to say have you had an experience of god dealing with you or you just got what somebody else had have you had an experience that you can stand on what would happen today if all of the ministry in this church was arrested some of you have a good excuse for not coming what if all the ministers in this church was arrested today what would you do i know what a man made a statement one time and you'd say he was stupid but you know what a man made a statement one time about all these things upon the earth coming upon us he said a good time to just go smoke a joint you remember that one he was as straight and honest as could be because he knew that was nothing else could happen he said just go smoke a joint because he knew there wouldn't be no hopes if you miss it there would be no hope or was it matter but you see church god has made a way for you and i he's given us the new birth he's given us the message of the hour he's come down personally among us and vindicated himself as to being true here in the little church at lula vindicated himself as to be in god can we put all of our life on that word that's enrolled where are we at we're at the change because the son of righteousness has already risen with healing in his wings so the next is going to meet him in the air and that don't have to that's just kind of like an automatic process you know because that's just the after effect that's why abraham and sarah never made it to that they made it to the turn back to young young man a young woman and then went off and died later we're not gonna die somebody's gonna catch it and not have to die can you look back there and see then the things in your life relates to those that was before us that actually we're seeing greater things than abraham saw what brother dale now i'm going to get this point quick but brother dale i've never met melchizedek remember that was a quote we started with that every son of the faith would do as abraham done abraham met melchizedek god came down to abraham i thought we believed that melchizedek was god in morphy yet you can say that it was a theophany and then you can say that theophany is the word but now you understand what the prophet is saying every son of the faith is going to meet the word we meet the word that is the son of righteousness why i said there at the last a moment ago the son of righteousness had already risen with healing in his wings we're past that part in the opening of the word we're at the basis of the change every son of the faith is going to meet the word gonna end it with that talk well abraham met melchizedek which was the word made flesh all right you and i are going to not just meet melchizedek we're going to be the word made flesh whether you think about it or not we are to be the word made flesh we are to be melchizedek in another form call the bride which is the word for the day and the hour that we're living you see why the prophet and what he said every son of the faith is going to meet the word every son of the faith is going to go through the journeys that abraham went but every son of the faith is going to meet the word isn't it odd that the best thing people says about us is all they want up at lula is word word word no you know i feel pretty good that makes me feel good that's all i can come up with that i just brag too much about the word you know and try to get to people to see who they are and where the word might flesh come on musicians where the word made flesh i thought we believe the word made flesh was the light of the age it's in your flesh right it's in your flesh see why brother branham could not be the son of man but the bride of jesus christ around the world can be the son of man the word made flesh how close could we be walking off the earth that's up to him and really i'm not much worried about it because i'm sure i'm enjoying the opening of the word while we're here you know and when it's all over with then we'll get to meet him what do we got think on these things our journey the same journey that abraham took but our journey takes us one step further than abraham went but abraham went to the grave when he got turned back to a young man the young woman he didn't make it see because that would end all the types there just couldn't be no other way but i remember there was a man before abraham it was not because god took him i remember there was a man named elijah that got in a chariot and just rode off the earth so the things are there in the bible to show what we're doing and what's going on go ahead brother that's trying to 279 and our journey is the same as abraham take time to be anybody have a need make friends with god is our sister's memory is what she's after and we pray we give her this prayer claw to believe and to show that we agree with her that by your stripes she's healed and you'll bring that memory back of the good not the bad jesus we don't need the bad we all have all of that memory that we need but we need the good part the memory of you lord the member of you guiding us and keeping us and directing us saving us and leading us and we pray that you'd restore under our sister just take that and keep it with you now let him be thy god anybody else enjoy still trust in his word yes take time to be holy speak off with and feed on his words make friends with god's two children with jesus alone by looking for jesus like him and we pray that no matter what they're trying to do with all this drugs who've given it to her that you'll take away the effect that they're having upon her that she'll come out of this come back to herself and get to the doctor and get everything straightened up because we believe you and we thank you we know we can ask we believe that we can receive that you can even make the medicine revert wrong for what they're giving her and make it turn out to the right we believe you father in jesus name anybody else speak off with the lord make that we're believing you lord and you come on the scene and manifest yourself in jesus name anybody else anybody else would just come in with jesus alone just remember brother quinn will be with us the lord willing for the weekend so pray for that praise the lord would bless and guide your dismiss father in jesus name we ask you to go home with each one of us give a safe journey lord let your grace and your love be with us we love you in jesus name you just missed a woman in the bible days her last meal will almost be flat god said elisha make his word known don't you worry god sent me today and before you even ask him helpless on the way just hold on little longer help is on the way better time is coming those who believe and pray help won't help tomorrow you give up today just hold on a little longer help is on the way
