that Friday preaching for us and brother Chris long will be here Saturday and Sunday but this coming up first thing is the Valentine's banquet and then coming up in March we'll have a few things going on that we are Al that we're thinking about and talking to people about so let's look in our Bibles to the Book of Revelations we have kind of shifted the gear a little bit and uh and I want you to uh bear with us today we're going to we're going to start on a new dispensation now what are we in the dispensation of today we're in the dispensation of the son of man we know that right all right so we that is our unique that is our call is to have Jesus Christ back on Earth again in his bride in its fullness he's been down through the ages in in part all right and we'll talk about tonight or this afternoon the Alpha and Omega has got to be the same and we'll look at that but remember please continue to read your your um uh Church age book we'll get into the Ephesian Church age here pretty quick but today I want to talk about a new dispensation because we are in this dispensation because of what because we're the last Church age all right everybody with we're the last Church age there's no more all right Paul was the first one first dip of oil all right God poured it in give them the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost we've had a day of Pentecost over here but then we have a message that's going to take us onto the coming of the Lord all right cuz seven is completion all right so that's why we are here on this side that's why we had to have a Prophet come to tell us how to live how to dress how to do all these different things he didn't tell us how to do these things it was already in the Bible and we'll see in the book of even with the Ephesians God starts out first thing he said you've lost your first love you've lost water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've lost you know trinitarian Doctrine in the first church age well now there's no trinitarian Doctrine in our age for us the bride age for us all right so let's read this and let's talk about a new dispensation because you know what all that was new when John John the Baptist stood on the on the shores and he said behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world well here you got your Pharisees and Sadducees standing over here going we got a lamb over here it's a real lamb Moses told us Moses told us to take this lamb and and slay it and and that's a human who are you well there was a new dispensation com in all right and you got to be able to see that right Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega like I said we'll get those those two letters the first letter of the Greek alphabet and the last letter of the Greek alphabet Alpha and Omega all right the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and leosa and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven cand Stat one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the PS with a golden girdle in other words he was dressed the way he wanted to show John he wanted to show John this person John had met the son of man John was laid on the son of man's bosom the real Jesus when he was here on Earth right but now he sees him in a different form his head and his hair were white like wool white as snow his eyes were flame of fire his feet like fine brass as they burned in the furnace and his voice as a sound of many Waters and we'll get into we'll break that down just for a minute since one maybe not here last Sunday two Sundays ago and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength you may be seated thank God he's the one that had us in his hand he didn't give it to somebody else he didn't give it to a pope he didn't give it to a priest hello somebody he gave it to the Bride of Jesus Christ and he gave us a five-fold Ministry to perfect the Saints so the only way you're going to be perfected is by a five-fold Ministry all right and he gave that in the first church age second Church age all the way up but there was no perfection in those ages until this age all right so that's where we're sitting today and the Bible tells us he was in the midst or the middle or amongst and we we found the picture here that's pretty much accurate except that those candles are separate which they should be together and we'll look at that in just a minute we'll pull up a chart some of you if you don't have U if you don't have one of these you need to get one and kind of lay it by your side or keep it in your Bible cuz we're going to reference this there's several up here if you need one but I'm going to try to pull it up on the screen so what we're looking at now is we were talking about a prism what is a prism now a prism is one item all right a prism is one it's a piece of glass and it and can't be in a any other form it can't be round to produce these numbers right something fail wind blowing something fell on the uh there's about 80,000 um peons out there in that in that on that one tree and they keep falling oh by the way me and Jun picked up about 10 five gallon buckets of of um of peans yesterday and there's more so if you want some tough I already asked you one time you're not getting them I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and we were talking about something and I said hey man I said if you need anything call somebody else so I took my little peon picker and I picked them up yesterday and we we still got probably three or four buckets left so if you want some go to the store and buy them it's kind of like the it's kind of like the hen Story the little you know you come come and help me do this but all when they're sheld and inside of a plastic bag right mom everybody wants them yeah I'll take them but shell them yourself but no you can help some I'm just kidding you we can we'll bring some not shelled shell them yourself but there's a lot of them Lord blessed us with like marbles out in the yard so uh we got out there and picked them up but just just uh if you want some we'll bring you some we always like to share we don't you know I don't we don't keep stuff to oursel we try to share it for you share it with you uh there's no more deer meat left so can't I've already shared enough of that so uh we'll wait till next season to see what the Lord will do to give us another one in case we um if we make it till this time next year amen I hope the Lord comes so when we're looking at this this piece of equipment it's called a prism and it's a three-sided we we put we'll put the picture up in a minute so what he's doing he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks both arms out in the shape of a cross saying I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's everything in between but he had to start somewhere and he had to end somewhere cuz a gentile dispensation started on the day of Pentecost and it will end when we take a body change and leave out of here then he'll go to the Jews is everybody with me all right so it is important to have the book ends right all right if you don't have book ends what happens if you don't have book ends the books just fall everywhere you got to have two book ends and we'll see that this afternoon but that prism he's standing and he is what he is the light Christ is the light he's the light of the church he's the light of the world he said he was all right and I believe he is only light there is if there is not light of God there's darkness and that's it there's no one between so when a light passes through a which has got to be a white light praise God got to be a white light it's bent or refracted into seven different colors all right is everybody with me on that it's the same light you haven't changed the light you've just shown the color that was already in the light all right cuz you can't add two can't take away those seven colors were in Christ when he walked on the shore of Galilee we all were in him the whole bride the whole Gentile bride was inside of that man by the Holy Ghost all right so so that light is bent now remember look this light's not broke I was thinking about this yesterday it's not a broken light man has broke the light and put all these different doctrines in to make it look a different color and you don't bend the word of God to say you bend it you take that same word of God and you bring it as an Ephesian Church age as a sardian church age per it's been just a little bit there's a little bit light here more than there is over here there's a little bit more over here and each wavelength is refracted or bent by a slightly different let me put it this way Church age right and characteristics of that church age every Church age had a characteristic all right and it's real strange sister Barbara's not here today but she gave me a a thing that all the constellations if you take seven constellations and take the seven Church ages that are in Asia don't you think think God knows what he's doing if you lay them right over the top of each other every one of those cities are right in the constellation of the heaven God's perfect sometimes we go oh man he's perfect he does it right the first time he put those cities in there put the people in there with the characteristics just so we can stand here today and look back into history and say that's exactly what they were so upon Passage through the prism the white light is separated into its component colors now one light seven refracted into seven different colors which is the seven Church ages look which is the Seven Stars the seven Messengers they had seven different messages cuz Luther's message today will not even get you in the body of Christ it is justification but during that time God winked at that refraction of light and said that's my man then Wesley that's my man then Luther Wesley all different one that's my man that's my different color that I'm going to use during that dispensation all right everybody with me on that and there are all the colors we won't go through them but that's what it looks like right there and any way you take that triangle and you can move it any way you want to you'll still get those that light can't do it with a circle can't do it with any other shape except that you put the white light in and then it refracts into seven different colors of light but one light one God one Faith one Lord one baptism listen Luther preached Jesus Christ Wesley preached Jesus Christ Columba preached Jesus Christ why that was the theme of the age was Jesus Christ he was in every person in the Holy Ghost they got the same Holy Ghost you and I did it's just our refraction of light which comes to what your eyes right how do you pick up light to your eyes if you're blind you can't see it so you pick up and there either um one of them was talking about the your eyes is is into your soul you know that's that's it's a Gateway you open your eyes and you see things that you can't forget sometimes we wish we did so the seven characteristics and we were talking about this a couple of Sunday ago the seven characteristics number one is his head and his hair with white like wool as white as snow now I want you to understand something we'll read this in just a little bit it looks like all these seven is nothing but just God bringing judgment down on the on the earth well he is a temporary judgment we'll read where brother R talks about a temporary Jud judgement on the earth cuz how's that how's that uh Ephesian Church age going to be judged it's going to be judged by what Paul said and his followers that's how they're going to be judged they're going to come up to the white Throne judgment they're going to say did you accept Paul that's why brother brandham we'll read it this afternoon where brother brandham the Omega bride he comes up and he says hey did Paul did did Paul preach this and this this he said yeah he said so did I and he said those millions of people were going and were resting on that what you and I can't take a trinitarian Doctrine anymore you and I can't form a water baptism in name Father Son and Holy Ghost why we've been called out of that age into another age called The Bride age but we're still stuck in Le OFA you drove you $50,000 Le out ofan card to church today well Donnie probably didn't he's probably two $3,000 but all right we all got here in a car all right Le osia at work all right his head and his hair were white like wool it's white as snow but every one of these we see that it's judgment but what he has to do is he has to first come and present his message and we'll get into this in in a minute he presents his message and when he presents his message through a messenger all right the people are judged by that so his hair is white as wool white bright as snow I'm just going to kind of skip through this real quick time means little to God now remember he didn't have he didn't have gray hair he had a wig like they do in the old if you watch an old movie or you go over to Britain and they have their court and all that stuff you got one guy sometimes you got two three guys and they got the white wig on well that shows Authority or wisdom as we see here the brilliant white hair does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom and that's what we're looking at the a perfect man we should have that white wig P Vision brother R said that signified his complete Authority now who has complete Authority we come to the white Throne judgment who's going to have complete authority Jesus Christ yes but there are other Thrones in the Book of Revelations which is me and you he has what he has transferred that judgment to his bride right right he signifies his complete Authority head head to foot robe to meet out Justice 1 Corinthians 6 verse1 says dare any of you having a matter against another go to court or law before the unjust and not before the Saints why you doing that all right do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters that's why a lot of things can be settled right here in church and it doesn't have to go to court now as I said before if you go out there and somebody hits you and he's a drunk if you sue him that's your business right but there ain't no brother going to be out there drunk so ain't going to be a brother praise the Lord all right and his eyes were as flame of fire brother Brown said there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do so his eyes was flame of fire try to skip through these pretty quick we did them a couple weeks ago just to refresh your memory Zechariah 4 says they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and thr to and fro through the whole earth and that's what that's his Messengers that's his bride you and I the things we see the things we look at is what we're going to judge by I mean they're going to look at you and they're going to say well well there's a a lady with a long hair and a long dress God's going to say I told you to wear one and you turned it down amen that's what it's going to be and you walking through Walmart and somebody says sniggers and says old grandma you know what white thr judgment they going to stand there and God's going to say why' you call her an old woman why' you call her old grandma and they're going to go wow cuz remember our thoughts are louder in heaven than they are here on Earth amen that's how that's how why it's important that we come back to the full word of God all right we'll get to that this afternoon and his feet like a defined brass is burned in the furnace now what do we know brass brass signifies judgment but it stood the test of the fiery furnace a test that no other one has gone through and that is exactly right for brass signifies Divine judgment not just judgment Divine judgment a judgment that God decreed and brought to pass pus Vision the foundation of the altar of sacrifice with solid brass typifying the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world judgment had already passed upon him when as yet there were no Sinners salvation being entirely of the Lord now we know one thing for sure God can't changeed his mind so he's already judged everything back before the foundation of the world but he wants to prove to Satan why he judged how he judged and who he judged it through yes all right that's what we're doing we're here to prove that Satan can't control all of our being and all of our doings yes amen amen you still smoke drink and cuss why the devil's still out there making people do that cuz God's in your heart you've had a change but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of all the Earth he shall be and with equity and Perfection will he judge Mankind and there will be no evading that judgment why because remember you're you're judging yourself here you're not going to go to the white Throne judgment and plead yourself out of something that's right right hello no you're not you you're going to plead yourself out here we accept what the lamb did here we're not when we get there as brother Bown says the tree falls that's where it lays the Bible says and he says whatever you are here death doesn't change you it just puts you in another place right there will be no evading that judgment no turning of that judgment there will be no tempering of it he that is unjust will be unjust still fil filthy filthy still the unchanging one will not change then for he has and never well these feet of br will crush the enemy they will destroy the Antichrist the Beast and the IM now through who through the bride he destroyed it at Calvary but that was his work to get started with that's right to give it to the bride yes and the Word was made what flesh they will destroy the Antichrist the beast in the image of all that is vile in his sight he will destroy the church systems that have taken his name only to corrupt his Brilliance and crush him along with the Antichrist all the wicked The Atheist agnostic modernistic liberals will all be there death hell and the grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be open thank God he said books that is when even the lukewarm church and the five virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats when he comes he'll take over the kingdom for it is his right and guess what with him will be thousands time 10 thousands his bride who came to minister to him glory and his voice is the sound of many Waters we know what Waters in The Bible signifies people all right people in tongues and Nations it is the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitude of witnesses like I said before you're going to be the witness that puts people in heaven or hell right amen right so we need to watch how we act for those are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Spirit All Through the Ages have testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear amen those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus who preach water baptism in Jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages oh he used man Revelation chapter 4 brother R says all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jefferson bille thousands of lived voices thund the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir the real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't know how to do that no he don't care how much you loud look he don't care how loud you holler devil don't care how much you can jump but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil you want to know what the Thunders are you are if you live a Christian lifej amen amen the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice the loud voice in St John 11:38 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together he's talking about this end time voice there's a voice in every age getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to be caught up with it number five he had in his right hand Seven Stars now we know who those seven stars are there's seven different Messengers and he had them in his hand so they had to come from God I don't know these people that think brother didn't wasn't a messenger to the age there's got to be a messenger somewhere there's a number seven there somewhere cuz there's seven stars we know who the six are you got to realize number seven has come or we got to look for somebody else that's right cuz he's promised even in the hand of God and he don't make a mistake that's right they weren't in the hands of the devil they're in the hands of God yes he has his right hand Seven Stars we know what they were they're Messengers he said they are not called by name which she's going to name them here when we get into the church ages they're just for set forth as seven one to each age from the Ephesian on down to Lea each messenger brought the message of Truth to the people never failing to keep it the word of God to that particular Church age each one held to it they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original light as each age pulled away from God his faithful messenger turned that age back to the word and we'll look at that maybe later on how while the messenger comes at the end of the age and rebukes the previous age from falling away from their first love their strength was from the Lord and they never could have stemmed the tide they were safe in his camp for nothing could pluck them out of his hand in other words those seven had a purpose yes when they came on Earth it was to bring the people from One Church age into the other yes that's why we don't have another church age pma's vision and this Comfort is not for the seven Church AG Messengers only every every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care for all members of his body so you're included in that in that hand if you accept the message of your day all right Isaiah 49 says I have Graven thee upon the Palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me he's got you right here yes and like I said before when he went to Calvary if your hand if your name was in his palm that nail went through your name praise the Lord I don't know about you but mine was there you got to decide whether yours was or not and then live it out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword for the word of God is quick Hebrews 4 and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit of joint and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart when the true word of God comes it always divides when Jesus came on Earth there was a division every Church a master comes on the comes on there's a division all right even when Moses stepped on the scene there was a division God said I'll take care of them all Moses said no hang on a minute there's some of my people there so Moses stood up one day and said hey if you're for me get on this side on if you're for Dayan and Cory you stay over there and guess what happened about 3 minutes later the Earth opened up and swallowed several hundred Believers of another message that's the Bible out of his mouth go with the sharp sword so everybody had a message and everybody had something to listen to all right that with it he should Smite the Nations and ruling with a rod of iron let's keep going on but you know that he is revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we are living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself all right it is the word is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in the last days as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they are rejecting him the word are now already coming to judgment crucifying him of fresh that's why brother ROM H he indicted this whole generation for crucifying Jesus Christ Again by their Creeds and dogmas and you know it's it's okay you can just go to church any way you want to no it's not went by a church just a few minutes ago women wearing them jogging riches things that's a disgrace a disgrace to God you wear them to work you going to wear them to church I hope none of y'all wear them at all I know we don't but that's just a disgrace but who taught them that somebody standing in the pull pit did if that preacher stand there one day and say hey you don't come in here with them things on or just preach the word of God and you'll see as as Cindy s Cindy did she just come on right in and accepted it and went right on Amen Let the Lord do it as brother L said let the Lord do it let the Lord divide this thing out let him let him do it he'll do it by his word every time no no man's idea involved amen that's what I like about those seven stars that was not man's idea he sent seven people on this Earth that had the mind of God or caught the mind of God for their age and you're going to be judged by that sir his countenance was the sun shineth in his strength Bible said in Matthew his face did shine as the sun remember even Moses under the blood of bulls and goats even Moses face shined and they had to put a a veil over his face because he he became listen now don't don't don't choke he became God so much till the till the Till The Shining Till The Shining of God was on him so much he was God to the people hello amen oh that's not no you know what that killed Jes Jus for they killed Jesus because he said he was God they didn't kill him for his good works Exodus 34 35 and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses face Shone and Moses put a veil on his face until he went in to speak with him Malachi 4 verse1 we like four and five let's read first behold the day cometh it shall burn as an oven Malachi 4:1 and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubbled and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name to you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings the healing campaign went forth and you shall go forth and what not just be healed but you're going to grow up yes start as a calf but you don't end up as a calf you end up as a full cow if I may say that I'm sorry if you take offense to that it's an allegory even the new city will have no light now I outside it may still be the Sun and the Moon I don't know they may have daylight and dark outside the city but inside that City where you and I are going to live Hallelujah we will be that light amen and that came unto me one of the seven Angels which had the seven vows full of seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife now he's going to show him the bride the Lamb's wife now what's he going to show him did he show him a person showed him a city and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain you can see a lot better when you're on a mountain and showed me that great City now I thought he was showing him the bride that's what he said come let me show you the Lamb's wife the bride and he carried me away in the spirit to great and high mountain and showed me that great city today I'm looking at the great City and all the dead in Christ are set sitting in a place of of nothing but pure light sixth Dimension brother R didn't say it was dark over here he said oh it was beautiful why because they were there they showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God and having the glory of God in her light her light was like into a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as what Crystal to display those seven colors of light coming from him Revelation 21:21 in the 12 gates were 12 pearls ever several gate was one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass you're not going to be able to hide your things you're doing never mind you won't be no secret place it'll all be transparent you be sitting in your city and you'll be waving its people you be sitting in your house and waving at the people oh we're not going to do that oh I thought I'm sorry we're we're supposed to be doing the heart thing and floating on the cloud well I know most of you know this but I'm trying to play the bass guitar in in my secret time and I'm sure glad I'm not able to have to play a harp to get into heaven It Ain't Easy us Dales are not even used to we can't even hardly Mama laughs so hard as she fell out of the chair I saw no Temple there in for the Lord the Lord can do Miracles okay I have a desire to play an instrument so for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple now look the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in for the glory of God now who's the glory of God you and I are the glory of God the glory of God did what lighten it it'll never go out once that City comes down it'll never go out and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut all day brother Danny you're going to have to get used to things not being locked if he could he'd lock his billfold in his pocket well I may need to do that anyway with anyway sister joy we appreciate her for there shall be for there shall be no night there so it's going to be illuminated by what you and I Crystal transparent gold you ever got that okay that's you am now let's go back to John and we'll get started right here on a new dispensation just for a minute when I saw him I fell his feet is dead now remember John types the bride right and he laid his right hand upon me who is he this one that was standing in the seven golden candle States saying unto him fear not I am the first and the last he keeps telling the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death why are we scared write the things which thou H has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches all right so God's got every bit of that in his hand he's got every bit of it in control what we have to do is like brother Ernie said we've got to plug ourself into that you're not automatically plugged into it you got to believe it you got to have yourself plugged in to the Eternal Word of God for your day so let's talk about a new dispensation Hebrews 10: 19 says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus now here's Paul preaching a message and Paul was a pH I mean Paul was a Jew Paul actually participated in the ritual of the Old Testament rituals right so he's going against everything that he thought remember he said I got to forget everything he said everything I think is dung and I forget them or or do away with them to get this new dispensation started started by John the Baptist presenting Christ to the church and they what' they do to him they put him out here having therefore a Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new I want you to watch new and living living way not paper oh they love that Torah they could they could roll that scroll out and they could read what Moses said well they read backwards they could read what Moses said and oh we got Moses quotebook and we do everything Moses said we do everything Abraham he was our father he wasn't even a Jew Abraham is our father we have all this what are you doing and Jesus said if you have known them you'd known me cuz they spoke of me yes sir same way at the white thr judgment you know what God's going to say you know me through them you knew me through the preachers that preached the sermon to you by somebody that lived a life in front of you by somebody that testified to you that's how God's going to judge CU Jesus Christ is not on the Earth right now in natural form amen so where is he he's in you so if he's in you then you Christ in you the hope of glory by a New and Living Way which he ha consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his Spirit oh let me make it a little bigger his flesh through flesh he brought Redemption through your flesh he's going to bring Redemption oh I did this that yeah just keep thinking like that now let me tell you something real quick I was confronted by something the other day uh that was an old Doctrine many years ago and Dad um he's seen them all where there was a time where people were preaching sinless Perfection where that we're already you know there was another one where we're already in the Millennium and I told you what I'd like to do is take them to the Lion's Den and throw him in and see if they were in the Millennium or not cuz lons are not supposed to bite you in the Millennium all right well we'll find out take them to do I I don't believe that okay and I don't believe this sinless Perfection thing I don't believe that that just because you believe the message just because Christ is in your soul that you're perfect hold on a minute all three sections of you because there's three sections of you Soul spirit and body your body don't sin your body is just a vehicle to sin with or to hold a Bible with all right so God's working gradually then I'm not going to you know I wish it was that way remember I turned 64 last Friday I had a pain from then to now that I ain't never had before and so all the other ones say Amen all the young ones go what he talking about SC back Chris going why what you talking about you just wait listen I hope Christ comes and I'm not kidding getting old ain't pretty no it ain't pretty at all what's that sister Trudy had a t-shirt or something gave it to dad said said old age something about old age she said but I didn't think it get here this fast okay but what I'm saying is listen don't look for that one day this pain is going to go away as we get closer to God I don't need my glasses anymore I wish don't don't don't come over here and say well well well I'm I everything I eat I'm not going there every and we're not heading toward something and we just going to get you know brother brother John's going to let his hair grow out and it's going to be like it was when sister Alicia met him and I know he was cute he's cute as a button do you understand what I'm saying the change tells us in the Bible that it we're changed in the what moment in the twinkling look twinkling of an eye that's when our change will come not that we're gradually as the word listen as Jesus Christ was the word as he gradually headed toward his body change it got worse but he had to believe sister Julie you got to believe believe Beyond The Impossible listen do you believe by these then you'll never believe you got to believe on what's In Here by what God Said Yes but this new testament we're going to take communion this afternoon so when we'll read the scripture where Jesus stands we'll read it right here but I want you to see something real quick a new testament so this is a new dispensation something new that's why it was hard listen that's why they killed every disciple of Jesus except John the B except John the Revelator they all were murdered cuz everywhere they went they hated it was something new it was some some new something I I kick him out of here well he keeps preaching well we're just kill him they cut Paul's head off didn't they but it's a covenant or a will a testament is a covenant or a will now that was a first Covenant remember the first Covenant God made it he said you eat of that tree you die you don't eat of that tree you'll live what they do they ate of that tree and they died right then he made a covenant with Abraham an unconditional Covenant he said Abraham you just hang on I'm going to do it for you that's right amen that's right and Jesus comes one day and he says he says a New Covenant we'll read it here in just a minute you remember when brother Donaldo was preaching about Matthew 242 24 where it exposed the two twins 242 24 well matth Matthew 2 Matthew 26:26 there was Jesus there was Judas and they were eating at the same table and all the disciples thought they were all good and as they were Matthew 26:26 you can't make these things up and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it what we're going to do this afternoon and it is an open communion if I don't say it's an open communion but people if if you're not born again you should not take communion all right and he took the cup take eat this is my body and they're going okay and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to him saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament have you never heard that before they were under the old blls and goats take this up here put it on the altar kill it okay my sins are done but I'm going to go back and do the same thing I did before cuz there was nothing as an indwelling of the spirit of a lamb or two Turtle does is going to enter into you and make you a better person but this guy is which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you and my father's Kingdom I was confronted again about we talk about the sinless Perfection people always want to get by with stuff well we don't take communion anymore because Christ has come well now I want to ask you a question for those of you that are in the message listen to his verbiage I say unto you I will not drink H henceforth of this fruit and he's holding the cup right of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom what is the Father's Kingdom how many quotes you want brother R said the father's kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so on the day of Pentecost when the father's Kingdom came the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why they took communion and we're supposed to take it until we go into his kingdom so don't go with me on that one Jesus said if you don't wash each other's feet said you don't have no part with him I'm just reading the Bible but it was something new and that were they were astonished by it I drink this but they really understood it because they didn't really understand in the upper room because where we going to get the scripture from is we're going to get the scripture from who Paul over in Corinthians right here 1 Corinthians 11 we'll read it Paul by Revelation come on by Revelation Paul saw what they were doing and caught the revelation of it and said it's not eating his body it's not drinking his blood we're doing this in remembrance of what he did 1 Corinthians 11:4 and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doe in what remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament see the Old Testament was covered under the blood of bulls and goats right but it just covered sin it didn't do away with it but this New Testament in the blood of a man which was God that life are is able to come back inside of me and you this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me Hebrews 9:1 but Christ being comeing high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle listen that was a good one the kind of Glory came down in the Old Testament sh of Glory came down consumed a sacrifice he he he he covered those people's sins for the year he he he as brother DS always say he busied himself with the people he didn't he he knew they were going to he knew what they were going to do but that blood covered and he couldn't kill him right then right cuz he said do this through Moses all right each each ordinance but when you come to this new testament all right the Old Testament was over here the new New Testament is in the blood of a man blood of God and it's not just the chemistry of that blood it's the life that was in that blood that was almighty God that wasn't a second person of a trinity but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle what was it his body not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood now look he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us praise God that's what Jesus did for us we couldn't do it for him we couldn't do it for each other he did it for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the Flesh in other words we didn't need Jesus to come right that's not right though we needed a new testament Hallelujah how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience not cover it Purge it from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament so you got to have Christ starting The Testament all right everybody with me cuz you can't have a new testament unless you do away with the old one pretty simple that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament old they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance which is what eternal life in your body they did not have eternal life in their soul in the Old Testament right amen nobody did no John the Baptist didn't even have it in his soul right everybody with me he was in the Old Testament remember see that's why there's a difference in receiving the Holy Ghost and receiving the new birth it can be one and the same but you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost and your soul be as black as Satan that's what this new testament does for us cleans your soul out the real you that person for where a testament is now what's a testament it's a covenant or a will what are we doing today I have opened up the will that God gave us and I'm reading you the will all right right because his will is his what his will is his word for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator amen amen all right Old Testament to make something new the old testators got to die right cuz remember Jesus didn't come in in the New Testament he came in the old the first book of the New Testament is the book of Acts right where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead so yeah Jesus had to die to come back and enforce this Testament but who did he who did he who do you enforce it by 120 on the day of Pentecost Peter stood up and said this is that this is what's starting this thing it's coming from us now Peter says look on us he didn't say look on Jesus he said look on us you saw us we just doing away with Jesus no we become him so much so the the world the world hates you he don't hate you remember what remember who was it somebody said oh Lord they hate me he said no they're not hating you they hate me inside of you that's what they're hating for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it has no strength that's why Jesus had to go away it's expedient that I must leave but I'm not going to stay gone I'm going to send you my spirit on the day of Pentecost I'm going to send my soul part of my soul back cuz see I can divide myself up cuz I'm God but I can't do it I have to preach Christ to you and then him give you that spirit I can't give it to you mama can't give it to you your daddy can't give it to you but it as of no strength while the testator was alive that's why when Jesus walked on the earth they didn't understand him right they hardly did anything he said Peter was always getting in trouble they were always getting in trouble they all Lord I'll be right there with you he said they won't be a one of you with me I got to do this alone cuz I'm God all what Calvary did for us don't ever forget it don't forget he died the testator died that body was cold and dead in the grave until it come back to life by the spirit that quickened it and that same spirit I thought Revelation I mean Romans 8 says what if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he will Quicken your mortal Body by that spirit that dwells in you where' he at today is inside of me and you do we begin to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of accommodation to you or letters of accommodation from you no we don't need no letter the letter kill it yes right yeah ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men remember the old phrase I can read you like a that's what you are amen this right here is not going to heaven it's going to disappear inside of you and you're going to become the book yes ain't that the way it happened with John he ate the book and the book was gone why it was part of John for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us Paul didn't have a problem with that Paul stood one day and he said if an angel from heaven come and preaches anything different than what I preached he said let them be a curse he said it twice right you say oh well you're not Paul well I got the same Holy Ghost Paul's got for as much as you are manifested manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves all right he push you right back down on the same level but our sufficiency is of God and then God said I'm going to use you to get this to the people right who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life now continue his thought but if the administration of death written engraven in Stones was glorious in other words what written in engraven in Stones The Ten Commandments remember the Ten Commandments came down God wrote them with his own finger and Moses had them in the tablets broke them had to go back up and get them again all right but if they were glorious so that the children of Israel could not step Ste fastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away with right how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory don't do this don't do that do this don't do that much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory praise the Lord Hebrews in verse one Donnie we got to read it for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image now look it was a it was it was showing it was an example of what's coming every lamb that was killed turtle dove all that that was killed in the Old Testament type Christ right but but you had to do away with that to get Christ here to be the testator of the New Testament because he had to die but he didn't die and go away he came right back on the day of Pentecost and a group of people but look he can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the C there un to perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered question mark because that the worshipper once purg should have no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year every year the high priest had to go back dress in his things and do everything God said to do for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not don't give me those anymore I'm going to give my body a sacrifice amen but a body hast thou prepared me all right now where is the body of Christ now I'm looking at it a body thou has prepared me through seven Church ages through seven groups of people that are going to make up the Gentile dispensation and there going to be so much me they are me she is him we'll talk about it this afternoon in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast no pleasure then I said lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will are Thy word oh God above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first all right he taketh away the first the stones the tablets the the the the even the holy of holies where's the holy of holies now I'm looking at it he taketh away the first that he may establish the second or new testament a new dispensation by the which shall by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down on the right hand of God from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified Hebrews 10: 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus you couldn't go in that holy of holies in the Old Testament you died that was a man even touched the ark yes and he died that's how holy God is but by a New and Living Way he's driving us into the holy of holies he's pulled back the curtain remember what happened when Jesus was was crucified the temple that that big old curtain 200 ft tall I believe it was covered that Mercy Seat now to show you man didn't do it it wasn't split from the bottom to the top it was split from the top to the bottom God did it he said hey here am I look out the window I have come in flesh and you've killed me you've rejected me but there'll come a group of people amen that'll be my body and do what I say yes sir by a New and Living Way amen which he ha consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh brother B in the rising of the sun said he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation any other has spoken of the Bride now watch it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride all right the characteristics of the Grooms got to be in The Bride for them to be together right all right is everybody with me if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh now we go back to Adam and Eve Adam and Eve uh Eve was literally bone of Adam and flesh of Adam just separated got it so that's what we're going back to all right now look CU remember a body thou Hast prepared me if it does something different from the GRE is in the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together made mechanics and Dynamics in other words until the church gets it back together we just going to keep having sermons now let's look here real quick we'll close right here Revelations 1 ver8 is what we'll get to this afternoon I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is which was which is to come the almighty what a statement you know I John who I'm also your brother and companion in Tribulation but John I'm sure his his normal mind went over here to now he never said that when he was here Jesus said a lot of things but he never said he was Alpha and Omega he never said he was the beginning and the end he never said he had the key to death in Hell well he didn't he had to die to become a new testament he was on the aisle of patmas for the word of God in the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first in the life last what thou seest right in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia Le out AA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken too the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to PS PS his breast we know that right with a golden girdle now why would Jesus be wearing something like that cuz he's in Bride form right amen and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to a foot G about his PS with a golden girdle now here's a couple of translations the diglot the original diglot says at the breast so cross here a belt of gold around his breast that's moffit's translation and then deity signifies what gold deity dedicated to death gold frankincense and merge what was given to Jesus by the three wise men and they weren't there when the baby was born sorry about that take your nativity scene up and that's the Bible That's What Spirit said let these Revelations we you when you think of something you look in the Bible and you go that wasn't in there before right oh I'm sorry pray for me I'm the only one that happens to how many times you read the Bible there's only 66 books how long You' been reading it it's CL how long you've been reading this Bible 69 69 years she's been reading this Bible it's become really old and you just throw it over in the closet right no you still go man what where' that come from same way with quotes you'll listen to a tape or read a or read a sermon and and brother Dale or somebody get up here and make a quote and say it was from the seven Church ages Jeffersonville 19 54 and you're like I just read that book why it wasn't your time to see what he was saying that's the unfolding of the revelation of God that's why it keeps continually opening and it becomes a new book to us now that's the Bible that's what the spirit said the candlesticks all right now the 13th verse in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks what one like un the son of man what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch How It Was clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her who's her her's the bride has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right GED about the PS not a man a woman now John turned and saw the son of man son of man but he was in Bride form the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ the golden girdle Patman Vision will be done musicians come on he was was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge notice a priest a high priest when he went into the sanctuary or went into minister to service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving never tied it over his shoulder across his breast but here he comes out walking out with a girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder gted about the PS the breast with a golden girdle GED up high what is it an attorney a judge the judge with his sash over his shoulder GED up here not down here as a priest see that shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John went all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as the judge mark of the beast 1954 and we found the church standing there in its beauty Christ just molded into it and the church had a white garment on he's talking about Revelations let's stand to our feet and you notice it was a woman around the breast that had the Garment covered over her shame and was had a golden cord though pulled around like that held it around the breast white speaking of the righteousness of Christ and the golden cord representing the gospel and the preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy Spirit where over the church the righteousness of Christ holds it there tied with a strin the golden girdle now listen this will be for later on for this afternoon the end time evangelism each age has had its message and its messenger seven stars seven candle all through the times every age has packed it message with a messenger god in every dispensation has set forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time now we can start back even from the beginning to Adam and Eve you sh shall not eat this you'll shall not do this that was the message and when man stepped across the message of the hour he's not talking about Adam and Eve no more when man Steeps across the message of the hour it brought death and chaos to the whole human race now that's how much the message means remember that wasn't just a complete blank denial of what God Said Eve missed it by one word she didn't deny God was God she didn't deny what God said she she just listen to what Satan said you won't surely die amen God gave his word so much here so much here so much here for each age then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one that was coming now watch this see like the Messiah always supported every prophet in his own life his own being the word that was given for that day he come and fulfill that written word Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 all the different ones we're acquainted with and for told of what the other one was going to be wait a minute there's no more Messengers so who's carrying the

who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of that messenger those who hear it those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective revelation seen that before but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God Amen man gets the Revelation he preaches it then five-fold Ministry gets that
