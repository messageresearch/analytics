that right or tomorrow night or something Brother Joseph and then brother Joe and all the family remember all of these that are way and just pray that the Lord would bless each one and uh we got um 520 last night for brother Ernie Villanueva so we'll put it on up to at least 600 and send it to him with a note that he gets to pay he gets paid for preaching when he didn't make it Noel just it gets paid for preaching even though he didn't make it he didn't get to get here but the Lord will be with him and he'll I've told him just when he felt like it come on down and be with us but we will send him that we appreciate all of it appreciate all of the food and all the doings it's really been wonderful and all and and we love the Lord and pray that you have had a good weekend for the fellowship meeting time and and all of that and and just uh you know it's wonderful to be able to Fellowship together and I've never been on Fellowship like most everybody is you know it's Two Fellas and one ship which you know Two Fellas and one ship still two Fellers and fellowshipping that you you try to fellowship and you know that brother random said in the Bible says it in the upper room they were in one mind and one Accord argue with each other come on you're supposed to know the message is that the way the prophet said that they were sitting up there discussing who was the greatest and what was going on and and what was going to be and they need to just say well we need to take it by faith and leave out what the Bible said it was in one mind and one Accord you know we'll never be like people think of getting together you know and everybody having the same ideas we're a body of Christ around the world but that's one goal they were ending up a room for one goal one purpose they were told to go wait they didn't just sit up there well we don't know what we're waiting on we waiting when they got through down there and the Holy Spirit did come they said this is that one mind and one Accord is not just everybody saying dog and cat and preaching the same and you know how people are on that though they say you know we would all be in Great Fellowship once we get together what they mean is once you come to their way of thinking well that just never will work I believe the bride around the world has got one mind and one Accord we're striving to bring this flesh that we are being in subjection to God to walk off of this Earth in a Rapture because what else would you want and we're in that time and I hope you I'll try to review it just a little this evening I hope he was listening this morning to what I was saying you know about the fact of the invisible see we look back there is visible we look over with ours visible and fail to see how visible he really is right now Among Us and what he's doing amen John 1 John 2 excuse Lord Jesus we love you And We Praise Your Great Name and we ask you to just bless us and guide us be with each and every one Lord and we know that Wade was having trouble this morning with his stroke so we pray that you would bless him as he's able to minister this afternoon and pray that the people would really enjoy what he's having to say and Lord give them fruit for your labor and Lord that you maybe be the honor and Glory of us all is our desire have your way with us bless brother Douglas them on the way home traveling and Lord just let your light shine in their hearts and lives we thank you for all things and we committed to you now in Jesus name amen now we've been reading this and reading Thessalonians and then come into this so now we're going to try to pick up a little bit verse 26. John 2 these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you no somebody is trying to pervert things right but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not any man teach you well look at that we don't need no teachers we don't need nobody to teach us the Bible says it but he just said people are trying to seduce you the prophet said if we didn't need teaching why do you put teachers in the body you know so see we we're supposed to know the truth but you need not any not that any man teach you nobody can teach you nobody can but it's the same anointing teaches you of all things in this truth and there's no lie and even I see that taught you you should abide in him that should be the same anointing all around the world the same Holy Spirit that's what I believed it was don't you now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now to back up just a little bit this morning to in our thoughts and all and we'll try to speak a little bit the Lord willing Wednesday on this and then we'll have questions and answers and things relating to it and I pray that if you got any points talks that you would write them down we could try to cover them on this that we've been talking about and what have we been doing talking about that the Rapture is a process that is taking place we're not waiting for it to start it already has started within us there's many things that will take place that are not finished yet because we're still here all right but a lot that we would be looking for has already happened you know or taking place and then we find that all of it takes place here before we go there because we're going to be changed here the day is going to be raised here the shout's going to be here unfortunately Arcane was here the trumpet together us together he's here and then we go there the the part of going there is the effect or what do you call it the finishing part of what's going on here all right then we went in to relate the two together and compare the coming of the Lord and there's many things related to the coming of the Lord but we're only concerned with what's related to us as the bride all right and we know that Jesus has already come the first time so his coming is in a process that is taking place all right I'm trying to get you and I to see something is going on I've had some dreams lately about some things and if I interpreted them the way that I thought my human mind would run I would be gone out to preach to the world if I went according to my mind of what I've thought to dreams would be if I told you the dreams you would probably think so too but I don't think that's right I think it's the point of what I've been trying to say to you is we've got to see something personal quit looking for the past and not you know quit looking at the president and see what's going on right now Among Us and taking place so then Rapture is already in process the coming of the Lord is in a process he's already come to to redeem the bride right that was his first coming to pay the price to die for sins that was his coming and we're now in the second stage or Advent or thought of his coming to you and I not to nobody else now and see then the third part of this would be when we come back with him into the millennium because that will really be the second coming of Jesus Christ will be finished in the coming with him into the millennium that will bring to pass the ending of it but to think about it see then everything is related to this part as I said about the shout the voice of the Archangel and a trumpet we better be concerned right here in the middle where we're talking about the voice of the Archangel and the resurrection and the things because that's what it's supposed to be all right so in the coming of the lord it's not the first coming we can read about that it's written down we can read about it we're concerned with the part that's relating to you and I of the time to come to catch away the bride all right we're not worried about coming into the millennium that's a long ways off all right so it's being concerned with what's right here now right here now all right now watch the message part as we try to cover it see then as we ended up this morning talking about the then he would become visible Among Us and raise the Dead and we're going to rapture the prophet said now he was visible back there all right but we want to put that fleshly right but that wasn't the way he put it remember he put it to them to the resurrection because there was something there after that Resurrection that he was not dire as a 16 element body you know he was there in a glorified body that was the same body that was at one point 16 elements but it had become eternal glorified all right and then he covers that point and he said that was the alpha and said then there's not much down through the heart in the middle about his appearing I mean about his the doing visible but then he brings it right down to the end time we're read and he's become visible Among Us not in the gifts he said not into just the things that took place yet he become visible physically see this is a coming the coming of the Lord is to each individual it's not a group coming it's not even as much as as the two of the two witnesses that will be more or less the Gathering Together in groups this is to an individual so then he can be right here right now in one person that they can already recognize what's taking place see what's going on and the person sitting beside of them wondering what's going on to one person he can be already coming into being within them but to another person they don't know what's going on if you're sitting in a denominational church today they would be talking about you know more or less the upgrader forms of them they would be talking about a rapture we talked about that in the Baptist Church you know and we talked about the coming of the Lord but we had it as a great big hollering Shout and some Archangel that would step down and raise the dead and some trumpet that we would hear around the world and and we'd say ever I shall see him well that's scripture right but the only position that I know of that I said this morning even with the internets even with all the TV everything you have there's places in this world today that every eye would not see him if he was here now the only way that I know that can be fulfilled into ever I see him I'm seeing me now without to be in the millennium when he would come back to the Earth you know and they would see him coming because remember in that the Millennium somebody's going to precede us here they're going to build houses and a temple Etc and then we are going to be the anointing to the temple according to the message of the Daniel 70 weeks all right then that way you could see that they could see ever I shall see him well see we got it figured out oh wherever I'll see him he'll be coming around the world some way you know but yet what if some of those things had already taken place and we've missed it what if it is shout was this message that was brought brother prophet you know brought to us what if the voice of the Archangel is the the Lord Jesus Christ in the bride of Christ did he be visible Among Us and race dead and we're going to rapture what if it is that the trumpet is a gathering of the people together the prophet said after the resurrection he said we'll all go up together hey all right the Bible says we'll all be changed okay so what if that's true that that's already a lot of it taking place then look how far we would be in the second Advent or talk of the coming of the Lord that he came back to her we came back in the end time with the sign of the son of man as I said your Scholars your writers you very little of it Scofield talked some of it even the great Apostle Paul the writers of the scriptures Peter James John now in the gospels they wrote of the son of man that was when he was alive and what he was saying but none of those writers even the great Apostle Paul spoke of the son of man no I'm trying to get you to see this part of what I was trying to get this morning of being visible Among Us see so he was back there we know but then the great secret was lost from mankind really it never did come into being as a matter of fact because the prophet said The Headstone hadn't come yet it's his words but it's to come in the end time all right now I believe that headstone was the opening of those Seven Seals and this prophet's message the entire message not just part That's The Headstone to the church all right but if we're not familiar with that how would we know anything else that would transpire how are you supposed to check the uh like we started off reading that you know how are you supposed to check people's doctrines and ideas by the word by the word but if you don't know the word how can you check them you know and then especially when they come and give you the Bible says a sign and the sign come to pass the scripture says we yet they take you to another God not to listen to them he said cause I fit that among you try you is that you're talking to the prophet is it the fact that he would permit even great things to take place he would have to permit the sign to come to pass wouldn't he any do that you mean God would do that to his little bride I believe it's uh gone to this evil age or one where he says that he'll let these come among us to prove that we won't fall like Eve he wants a bride that he can trust I used to have a buddy when I was out in the world and me and him didn't get in a lot of trouble but I didn't have no fear when we were together because I knew he would be at my back and whatever took place you know we'd be together because he was my friend you know well see I believe the Lord wants a bride that he can put his confidence in that he'll even allow things to go wrong do you know that if now other than what we call the the things of the world of I don't believe ever bad coal is is that the Lord has to say put the bad cold on him you know no no it's just a part of the world but he can't put death on you the devil came unless God permits it which you know what he permits it but but brother Dale I thought he was a loving God he is but you know what he wants us to love him for what he is you don't want us to love him because it he has healed us delivered us he wants us to love him even if he don't do it then he will do it because it won't be no backup but you see this thing is a little different we think all right then if it's coming is already in process there would be a large amount of scripture would already be fulfilled right and as I was saying then to fulfill that scripture would bring what it brought Christ the son of man all right now these sort of man deals with Resurrection that's why you know Jesus said to son of man has power it deals for the resurrection he had the resurrection sign all right now when did odd then as I was explaining that nobody knew about these things of the son of man and here comes the little old man out of Kentucky with a seventh grade education and he starts in the 40s and the 30s we don't have the recordings until 47. but in the 30s in things and coming on down he would be speaking of the son of man but what writer Authority would demand be bringing out things that even the theologians even Nepal didn't mention he evidently he was a prophet all right and then he would stand as I said this morning turn and say like Sarah you know laughing behind him and said why is your life and he would stand and say there's a man sitting in the balcony in a bath you know the Baptist behind me here with just dying which it does sayeth the Lord is healed and he said that's the same sign you can't deny that even in the early Ministry of brother random that he had to sign of the son of man he said bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for him now where's a man ever been able to stand and do that that didn't make him the Lord Jesus no that's where people went wrong because it couldn't look past and see that that son of man was the one inside of him declaring the gospel unto you and I it's hard for people to follow it and I'd admit it'd be hard for us too like we've listened the other day you remember when the the uh brother Banks would in them that you know I mean before we went fishing he was sitting out there and he said we're gonna I'm gonna catch one and then just do it this will happen that'll happen and nobody won't catch no more they go fishing you know and everything's just the way said it the man had to admit he said well if a man can see Fish before he catches them you know but you know that was something that you and I can't do and I wouldn't want to do it I have enough trouble with what little Ministry I have I wouldn't want that ability because it carries a lot of weight to it but he had the sign of the son of man all right but what was it down Through the Ages you know it's the same Holy Ghost right you had to sick heal the dead raised you're in all kinds of things either Martin or Columbo one it was recorded how many times has he raised the dead and even a great man one of them Smith wiggled I don't know now if I get them wrong you you put tonight but one man that had 17 people raised in the Dead and wouldn't even a church-aged messenger huh what was going on during that as we talk about the Alpha and the Omega and brother random would say nothing in between but then he'd say Alpha and Amiga and everything in between and people say see you was back there I said he's over here and he wasn't doing nothing down through there now that's just one of those deceiving lies because the sick ever was healed the dead has Ever Raised I don't care who was standing there if the Beatles prayed a prayer and a person was healed and God done the healing The Beatles didn't do it all right well see I want to approach that part with you and to think about it that he emphasized visible back there and then he brought it over to our day and emphasizes visible and not much down between there and his scene you know he said we've had to give us we've had the great things we've had healings but he left it as being something more visible in the last days all right so now if that be right let's get into something that maybe these little wording here that we've just read in the scriptures would give us an understanding to help us to see what has taken place what is taking place and by that we'll know what is going to take place so now let's read over again go ahead and pull up number 1A which is first John 2 28. and let's just read that and look at that scripture and follow it now think about it now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming and he's talking about two things appearing and coming all right if we get it if we if we're in on it and abide in him and confine his appearing then we can be ready for his coming so then remember what I said this morning and what I've always emphasized don't go down to the bus depot to wait on an airplane it won't come by there all right be in the right place if we can follow the appearing most of you know the quotes and time but think about it if we can follow the appearing then we can comprehend the coming but if we just go straight to his coming without seeing what's been going on what would we have you would have an alpha that he was Dire and an Omega over here and nothing in between and I don't believe that even the Bible said he stood in the Mist of the seven golden candlesticks well that would put him if you're going to be carnal with your understanding that would put him more in the middle Church ages right then in the beginning or the ending I mean if you're going to Mississippi Carnival but I believe it's like the prophet priest he's the same in every age it's us it changed because my wife likes to say it it was not the spirit that was taken away in no age God has been the Holy Ghost in every age is the word the word is what God ate either way Spirit was still there right because you can't do away with the spirit of God all right and see then to look at it we know that something is being said by the great John who at this time had already been to Patmos and came back the Little John's as we call them one two and three was written after John went to Patmos that's why he could talk about the Antichrist when no one else even uses the word Antichrist he could talk about the great love of God because he saw it all right so he could talk about his appearing in his coming so now let's read a little bit and see what he says we've been over these many years ago in many different times but go ahead to number one which is the end time evangelism 1962 603 paragraph 50. same thing today when you see his work now we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the Lord now remember appearing and coming is two different words Amen to appear and then to come so which one comes first appearing and then coming now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now it's a sign of this coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the Holy Spirit doing so that's the appearing of the Lord now remember it spoke both places appearing and coming now think about what I've been trying to bring then the first part of his coming is already a past tense form because he paid the price we're in the Advent of his coming to the bride and I believe he's coming over age to the bride all right sure if he's Alpha and Omega and it's looking like it's something of great on each end what is in between I believe he's been appearing I believe that's what the prophet is trying to explain he's explaining appearing see and that appearing means something that you can see taking place but then why would it be speaking why would John say in his coming why would the writer speak of that people will love his appearing all right then I'm trying to break it down for you to understand so then he was back there in the resurrection visible at that time he started a process of his coming and I believe the church ages is the coming of the Lord to them but not coming like it's supposed to be finished up so we'll call that the appearing of the Lord these appearing great signs and wonders are transpiring to the church ages but yet in the end time something started happening about his coming when a little man began to speak of the son of man well that would have to deal with his coming he's the son of man that's the purpose of Son of Man because it is the coming of the son of man all right now to take you off the hook to look for anything physical remember this morning we spoke of it we always speak of it that he's not to be here physical Among Us because he doesn't set foot on Earth in a Corporal body until the Millennium or whatever you want to talk about a body huh so down to the age it was his appearing and then here in the end time there was a prophet came to a work of restoration would have to be brought it took him 33 years to be able to preach the statue of perfect man that's what he said all right in doing it he had to make a a work of restoration back to the faith of the fathers then as he said not in preparation but said when the message begin to sound but it runs message really for what he come to bring started in 63. all right the other was restoration right all right so you can see him as he's talking about as we just read that he's now peering he was back there bringing the word he's appearing Among Us and as I was bringing out the other night he even thought himself he'd preached the seals he thought he'd preached all of Malachi 4. he thought everything was finished but he began to study for a little message called spoken words Original Seed and he got up there and he saw it and brought it and laid that down so wonderful but he realized there was no rapture no change so we remember he said Lord what can I do said I got him out on the limb nowhere to go yeah I don't let him get that nowhere to go that's the best way of staying there right good point yeah Holy Spirit said pick up your pen and he started writing and what the prophet had preached up to that point you check it the Holy Spirit reviewed that exactly of what he was bringing and got up right where he was standing with nowhere to go the Holy Spirit spoke not right around him the Holy Spirit spoke and says as of yet Malachi 4 is not finished that was the six hour sermon on spoken words Original Seed well you know what he done what do you mean I preached Malachi 4. I am Malachi 4. you told me I've Malachi 4. you witnessed I was Malachi for you said my message with forerun right and he says well if it's not fulfilled I I guess I'd better start moving on to see about getting this fulfilled don't you think so don't you think that right there immediately in his mind never came a total answer to the whole thing but in his mind came a doing that if it's not here and he's speaking of it and that means one day it can be brought to pass I told you one day the Lord spoke to me and after all the years and you know how hard I preach and not challenging the world to a debate no but it's to the point of believing the message the Lord said you preached the message and I'll back it up you heard me say that many times haven't you well what did I do well we mean Lord I've been preaching the message best I know the I started being more and more sincere and more careful about the way that I approach the things well see I don't have to back off of that now because we've seen the dead raise the sick healed we've seen God move so I don't know how to back up from that all right but get it now down Through the Ages it was not his visibility visible in the end beginning visibility and Through the Ages you can speak of the appearing and even up into the prophets Ministry the Lord was appearing he said his coming is not there's something about it you say I believe now this is me personal okay I believe when those seals broke to that prophet he stopped looking then for the Lord to come and he started being like he said and we were talking downstairs somebody quoted it today maybe brother Douglas where he said Paul Revere said he's coming he said I'm saying he's here he wasn't looking anymore for the coming of the Lord I believe he was looking at the coming of the Lord or what words you'd like to use in that form he knew it was transpiring and he knew before 64-65 on the Rapture 65 he knew the shout was the message go run it into your computer he knew this out was the message that had been brought that he had brought and he's looking at it like a something that Lord I know and see you'd have to be a minister a lot of times to understand another Minister and I know that's hard but that Prophet when he seen it he said Lord you've been appearing here Among Us run it in your computer appearing and coming and just read all of the things a lot of them are related to different things you know but he said Lord now it's time the Lord said okay get ready he starts trying to preach around and up and down and moving along to our lives to 62. dream starts happening Vision starts coming and he's heading west I believe that in 63 when the seals were broke to the prophet now the way I'm saying it you listen to it because it's the way I believe it he wasn't told out there in Arizona what to do you go read your message he was told to go home it'll be told to you a lot of people think he was taken up into the clouds and told everything right there if he did now something happened because when he come back he preached um what was it God in Simplicity and he preached the breach and on there he said I don't know what that first seal is well everybody thinks he was took up out there and told it he's the one who said that I didn't you're the one making him a liar he said he met him out there and told him to come back home and be told him what to do but when he comes down to the end of the week he's talking about the coming of the Lord right and he said this great seventh seal the coming of the Lord if you knew right there the message was right and that he had brought the man the message and everything from their own came out of the seals now are we in the message he said the rapture came out of the seals said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals the future home was revealed in the seals well I didn't hear him preach it I heard every message I've heard him 10 times I ain't never heard him that's the way it goes see you you're trying to figure it out and you'll never know what God was revealing to the man what was he saying he realized what he was saying to me was a point that once those seals broke the entire Bible was unveiled before him didn't mean he understood every word of he didn't know what it was it was unveiled and by being unveiled he could look at it see the great things I believe if he was still here today he'd be preaching don't you what would he be now hundred and three or four years old but he'd still be doing the best he could do why because there's so much in that word right what are you following me why would he emphasize so much and say there's a difference in the appearing in the coming and he would say he's appearing now Among Us getting ready for his coming huh and if you'll notice the statements are basically right in the 60 to 62 area all right so let's read a couple of them so you won't miss it letting off the pressure 1962. but if you can beat all that away from you say Lord God I believe just exactly what your word says and I believe as we preached last night that the appearing of the Lord comes before the coming of the Lord for it's just two different words altogether see now is the appearing as he promised in the last days that he'd be with us appearing we're going to the next one is I be not afraid 62. you know there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ that's two different words altogether he's appearing now in his church we see him we know it's him it's the Holy Spirit see we know it is there's a difference watch him now this is it goes on into e66 that was 61. there's a difference there's a difference there's a different word used the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ see it's two different words altogether now Christ is appearing in these last days in his church bringing his church together in unity and faith and Power in the word and all together that when he returns he will find the same church what the Pummel worm left the canker we're meeting what the king of worm and all now see he's bringing into his church now a scripture comes into mind with me and Jesus said the paraphrasing sorry see when he returns will he find faith you remember that in the scripture when he returns will he find faith you know that's a questionable you know when he returns he'll only find faith in the bride that's horrible isn't it to think of the religious world today around the world claims to be all of this and the other but he'll only find faith in the bride um two different words look at this one we would see Jesus 62 6 27. now we're at the West Coast and the so sun is appearing before he's coming remember appearing and coming is two different words he's appearing now in the church showing himself a lot after two thousand years serves we would see Jesus now so there's a difference in the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord now may I illustrate it this way right over here in this church you know that he can appear over there and heal the sick raise the Dead cast out devils and don't you see it around the world what's taking place he's appearing is among the organized religions of the world and great things are taking place are you going to deny the sick being healed are you going to say them people healed them no I'm not I'm going to say what I did this morning if the Beatles prayed for you and God healed you it wasn't the Beatles it was God that done the healing so if there's any sick healed anywhere God is the one doing the healing so then put his appearing he can be appearing all over the world today among the church religion religions of the world and doing great signs and wonders but that's not his coming are you getting the difference in the two words his appearing could be down Through the Ages because there was a visibility not at the resurrection there's to be a visibility in the end time and he's appearing to the ages and sure in a way he was coming to First bride because that was his coming is in his brightness we'll get that in a minute you'll see what I'm talking about but there's a difference between his appearing in his coming how close is it when he says he's appearing Among Us healing is sick casting out Devils great things taking place but that's not his coming now I didn't say these things and I'm just trying to get you to look at a point so then why would walk away to the Lord if the appearing of the Lord could be signs and wonders are you listening if appearing is signs and wonders what would be his coming now remember he's coming that we're speaking about is what the prophet said he come the first time to redeem is right the second time he comes to take his bride away all right so what would be then the difference between appearing and coming as I said then he can appear in any church or any position or a situation and heal the sick right I mean if the pope prays for somebody they get well are you going to make light of that you better not you might get the disease on you because you remember what the Bible says when he the Holy Ghost has come right Jesus said I forgive you son of man I forgive you we said we need the Holy Ghost has come one word against it don't make light of nobody you never heard me say Ah that's a bunch of old crash over there they say yeah but those people healed don't tell me that was healed that was just some work up that's just some thing happened you better be careful you could open up the Avenue for that sickness to come from that person to you uh you want the prophet's words would not he tell the people to be real careful in your prayer lines all right he said because this sickness can come on you see because you open the channel to let that sickness come to you see there's a lot of things in the appearing that we could spend hours still talking about but do you get the point there's a difference in the appearing and the coming of the Lord if the appearing can be signs and wonders what is the coming of the Lord but that's all anybody wants come on I've had to fight this thing for many many years of people saying well well you don't go to Bert Lula if you had what you think of God so it could be healed everything be happening well that's their business you know that's your business what you think you take your little pity party that you're sick and you're not believing the word of God to deliver you and then blame everybody in the church it's their problem if everybody in the church is Right I'd get healed might not right we don't blame everybody else right what is the difference in the appearing into coming no I'm going to say it and then try to prove it Satan can work among the appearing but he doesn't know what the coming is he's heard it but he don't know what it is he said well how can he be among the Healing Center the prophet said he can pass out Supernatural gifts now you argue with him that's not making the devil A Healer that's right God does the healing I was explaining it a minute ago and you at least looked at me whether you amend it with a nod or what you see Satan can pass out those gifts but he's not healing nobody it ain't one devil going out you know now that could happen that one devil could go out and let another devil come in because there's bigger devils but if a person never healed anywhere God had to do it right now are we back at the first of the message then would it be hard to understand that he would permit these things to transpire that even the pope could pray for somebody and they'd be healed start crying about your gifts boy look what we got turn on the radio and find out some Baptist or something like that got greater signs than we have are you listening what's the difference in appearing in the coming when Satan can be in on their peering and God can even allow those things to transpire but Satan don't know what his coming is what is this coming when we know it's not a physical you know what I mean it's not a Corporal body we know better than that what is the coming of the Lord what do you think of the coming of the Lord what would be the one thing that Satan cannot impersonate the game I know the quote you read it in your mind just now you can't be the Holy Ghost I agree because that's tied up with it you know the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word you agree with that page 45 Christ of Mystery I believe that's right he's the only revealer of the word so brother random couldn't reveal anything to you and I Jesus said my own body did not reveal that unto thee with my father see then he's the only revealer of the word brother Brian revealed to me serpency he didn't reveal to you serpent seat God has to reveal it to you but I got you now brother I got you I got to go God wrote Moses interpreted well show me one Jew is ever saved by the interpretation of Moses oh come on show me one Jew is ever saved by the interpretation of Moses Moses explained in natural words what God had written in a supernatural language but he couldn't make it he couldn't reveal it he couldn't make it Leo if he did why did he Smite the rock the second time so you see don't get so much ideas that you can quote just remember some of us have been around long enough to quote with you we were life another day about it we was in a house one time for a fellowship meeting for them to uh change it because some of the brothers wanted to go deer hunting and it fell on the opening day of the the deer season and and they wanted to someone wanted to go hunting because I never I didn't go myself so I just asked permission would they move it a week you know just for allowing so we get dire and you know and there were some brothers that they hadn't even been at a meeting at all hardly ended all but they jumped onto me outside out there and they said why is a Rapture took place well you was gone hunting should have been in the fellowship meeting for the Carnes his brother now I'm 99 sure I don't think it was it's brother Tom brother Carnes is your brother he was sitting at a table with him and them brothers they was letting me have it well see I could have went in where the dad and been to the meetings or whatever I was just standing there grinning had a while one of them said what if you missed the Rapture going hunting I said well you know there seems to be a little quote coming in my mind and brother random said you remember he said I'll meet you on them game trails oh brother Karns brother he said I told you to leave him alone I told you he'd have a quote leave him alone I wasn't trying to be sarcastic I just had a decent memory but listen folks what is the coming of the Lord if there's a difference in the appearing what is the coming what is the thing that Satan cannot impersonate when he can impersonate any gift what is the one thing you can't do what is the coming of the Lord to you when it's not a physical Corporal body of this part that we're talking about what is it to you you'll see why brother Dale's been like he's been for 45 years but I saw this and when I did I said Lord I'll do my best to explain it see the coming of the Lord in this part of time where we're at is not a physical body right you agree with that now there's got to be something else and it's not just signs and wonders because Satan can get in onto that right but you know the one thing that he can't do he can't bring this word word by word you need that quote he can't bring this word word by word said they'll take so much of the word and make it work but they won't take all in the word you see today around the world there's take Ministries people sitting at home listening to brother random but you know according to the word that we've just talked about uh brother uh don't call his name but brother in this message he says so you know I I read this morning he said it's still in the Bible you know he give a scripture or something that was his point say Rebecca probably giggling because she knows it was her daddy I said well he used to talk he'd say I read this morning it is still in the Bible you know well you know I've read for a long time so then tell me brother that I want you believing what you're talking about see the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word that's the one thing Satan came impersonate he can't impersonate the revealing of the word he can't follow it word by word he's got to have some concept like to Jesus you know cast yourself down angels will bear thee up unless you dash your foot turn these stones to bread see he's always got a carnal understanding right always something carnal some way of expressing something some way of doing this little carnal state that's the way Satan's always been well brother Dale I guess in a way you could be right you remember the mule is the one that said in a way you remember that the other week it was the mule that said that he said there's no such thing the prophet is in a way it's either right or wrong you see word that I've stood for 40 something years but I finally had to walk alone because of the stand that I take I have no problems with that I'm not alone I'm not that person you think I am I was talking the other day with my wife about some situation it breaks my heart every day my heart is troubled heavily and don't tell nobody don't even tell her when I'm troubled because of brothers and people that I've walked with that don't want the word yeah up to a certain spot and then stop are you calling them the devil well brother Brown said the devil will take so much of the word they said he won't take it word by word do you need them quotes or do you believe the prophet said it that way see the only thing that Satan cannot impersonate is the opening of the word driving well now of course here's where we go the two Soul people say they got the opening of the word the seventh anniversary people has got the opening of the word the perus he is is got the opening of the word may I say something without you thinking too much about it but around and said he went to the Catholic I was a Catholic he said Mom and Daddy was and he said I went to the not get these wrong you put them together he went to the Methodist he went to the Presbyterian he went he said one day I just realized that it was the word he said cause if one of them's right you know they're drawn so if the two Souls is right the rest of the message is wrong it's the seventh on diversary people's right the rest of the message is wrong if the two Lords is right the rest of the message is wrong if the River Jordan doctrine that Jesus wouldn't God until the River Jordan if that's right then the rest of the message is wrong do I need to go back and read where we first started the people are deceiving the people but you know what I love about it too because I loved all the word he said it must needs to be heresies among you why the Bible tells you why it must need to be heresy among you that they that are approved may be made manifest what about it what do you think about the coming of the Lord well it's this is that well anything you bring me to talk to me about the coming of the Lord has to be any situation in the quotes of the Prophet then they'll ever one fit one time the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word because that's the thing Satan cannot impersonate what do you think about it so there is a difference in the appearing in the coming there is a point that he was visible there see much in between but then he comes down here and be visible again but you know somebody who stands on the word and tries her best a year after year after year is not very popular but the people that are predictions and run off on this Doctrine and then run off on that Doctrine and run off on this Doctrine I heard a correction on one of the points we heard your mom acted man wanted a vacation and until he's gone two weeks and they said just keep on going I heard it more straighter than what it was he went in and told them according to the last account that I heard today is that he went in and told him he said I'm going to take two weeks and in two weeks I'll tell you whether or not I want to keep following this message and they said he hit the road you may not have to come out here and tell you until you said sister Gail give me a couple of weeks to figure out whether I want to believe that Jesus was God or not if I ever figure out whether it was or not I'll preach to you you wouldn't want to hear me preach no more you'd say so long right what is the coming of the Lord I thought the first coming of the Lord I thought was that the prophets built the body which was the word and Jesus stepped into that word that they brought that's what I thought gifts and signs and wonders yeah quote right around him and I'll quit he said one day I'll show you where those gifts he was used and was not right that's paraphrasing it right do you remember it though like the signs are taking about a hand and the thing it was never supposed to be brought because the people were supposed to believe the word but God knew they couldn't believe it so he sent signs to try to get the attention a sign has never healed nobody never saved nobody but the Lord come in present and how much more today would you want of the Lord's coming than for him to just keep on opening the word that you could study it and 40 years later you're still enjoying it 1969 the first message was what the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the son of man made manifest on Earth that's the first sermon I preached you see that's why this little is just built on one time word words word that's all I can do but any sign of Satan can impersonate any guilt he can impersonate but that don't leave us without gifts that don't mean I don't believe in gifts I'm a firm believer in gifts but as long as they're lined up with the word you remember the man that come to brother random and said I want to straighten you out on that marriage and divorce around them he said I had a vision he said immediately I saw he had a dream but you know he still let that go when a man got to explaining all the lovely things he said yes sounds good but said it don't fit the word right come on musicians he said it don't fit the word well you gotta have the word for everything I hope so go to the knots you'll run after some strange Doctrine at some point or something and you will say oh I must be right look at what's taking place now if you want to call this a prophecy or whatever it is whatever you want to do 40 something years ago I stood in this pulpit and I said it'll come a time when the Baptists and Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals Etc will be having signs and wonders in their churches and they'll say look we must be right because look at the things that are transpiring is it right around the world today what are you going to do if some of these doctrinal people that you know have been in die-highed into two Souls of the other virtues and things and signs and wonders starts falling what are you gonna do random said I don't care what takes place and we're perforation it signs and wonders he said but if they stay with the same old simple message he said get away from it is that a quote so we're supposed to be worried oriented people that's what I thought that's what I've always thought you know what else was we supposed to be yeah but signs and wonders what I'm building signs follow them that believe Believers don't follow signs signs and wonders now what did your Prophet say the brother was quoting it last night may I quote it and I said no let me quote the other but Iran says these virtues without the Holy Ghost is a stumbling block you see well he didn't say that now let me put it the way he said it he said to gifts without the virtues that's what I'm saying the gifts were not the virtues as a stumbling block power without character the brothers quoting line is what satanic I like the way he said it I can't even I say satanic he said santatic I thought that's the best way to say it I guess but what do you think about it there's a difference in the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord I want the thing that Satan came impersonate don't let me hold on to that what we got 27 in this fire book anybody have a need what about the word remember the old colored brother I'd rather be standing on the word standing in heaven why would you say that he said calls the book says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass your way my brother's concerned about his wife and the most biggest concern about yourself so we just ask you Lord to let him come to a place to see where he's supposed to be we want to see her father we love you father when we thank you Jesus name come and let's see got a problem on one of us and let's just pray that it'll be taken away all right Lord Jesus we thank you for your word it said by your stripes we're healed the Levy's got a problem with one of her feet the orders it's giving her hurting her little knot that's on her things we ask you Lord to just take it away let your love be made manifest really in Jesus name asking yourself let's give him a prayer cloth and pray that the Lord would bless him let everything work out you know for the Lord's honor and glory honor in the name of Jesus Christ May everything be all right our brother will go and everything will work out all the work the job the things everything will fall right in line because we believe in Jesus name what about it the coming of the Lord revealing of this word God is not a physical born coming inside of us the growth development of the word because Peter says being born again growing in the word anybody up before we go please Jesus then we shall be thank you mother you heard our sister she doesn't even know how to pray hear what to ask for but she just wants to ask for you to take over and you do what would be needful in her heart and her life to her that you can have the preeminence we love you father we thank you in Jesus name do you believe it anybody else wow see we don't take all the words we take what we want I remember some brothers years ago they emphasized heavily over and over and over and you'd walk up to them and to ask them to be you know to pray for you they'd say you've been to the doctor because there's a quote around him says you got no right to go before God till you went to the doctor but that didn't mean you didn't pray for people and it just means go to the doctor go to the doctor and he went in South but see there was a point made to emphasize something you don't have to go to the doctor you're standing right here and believe what's wrong with going to the doctor well at the end of my faith well you don't have any plain enough you got faith you mean Abraham every day said I better not go by that doctor's office I'm going way around because I'm about to pick up some Spirit it would make me doubt God was going to give me that baby I wouldn't care if brother Reynolds said it I wouldn't care if he said Abraham went to the doctor every day and had a test to see where where he was capable of having children it wouldn't bother me foreign we've seen these prayer claws go out to many people around the world I'm seeing God deliver well why can't we believe it again mother whatever our sisters ask for let it be a phoenix product we love you in Jesus name amen let's go believe it you see delivery you want
