unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now we'll go to second Peter and we'll go to verse one Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now remember this is not written to the world this is written to the born-again believers those who have the true faith in order they have the new birth it says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord according to as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue all right now remember this is the age this is the time they're really fulfilling that scripture that everybody's called to walk in Christ but this is the age to talk about the called us to glory see to be glorified the glory and then called us to virtue all right whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word yeah yeah I pray that this morning's message helps you to understand some of the things that we're talking about and you know what we're trying to do and seeing that you know the main point to come from that message I'll try not to back up too far but to see that by the new birth you come to this position called faith the new birth all right little Brennaman say how faith and be born again because that's the born-again believer that's a position all right now that faith puts us in to the body of Christ by the new birth eternal life in our soul all right now here was the point this morning bringing it up see all right that the new birth by that new birth the born-again experience giving eternal life to the soul made God a dwelling place to dwell in to each one of us all right now he's always took and had a dwelling place of the tenth headed in the tabernacle he had it in the different things and then it finally came unto Jesus Christ walk upon this earth as the tabernacle of God the body that God dwells in all right He gave His life to her that that life could come back in you and I because that was not even though that was a fulfillment of his desires in the beginning was to come down and dwell with mankind not just creating us and then something happens and then he chooses it now he always had that plan because the plan and purpose of God is fulfilled in Jesus Christ on earth he had a desire to be Savior healer deliverer etc all right those were there he never received those attributes as he come into life he had those attributes to be all of that all right then it had to be displayed so he had to come to a place that dart was his body the eternal I mean the the natural physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ became then the body for God to live in he was borned Emmanuel God with us and soul he was eternal in spirit he was eternal that's words of the prophet all right but the body was not eternal because it had a beginning not that it it was sinful or anything it had a beginning anything has a beginning has to have an ending to it or it has to be made eternal alright so then that body that he was dwelling in he walked in that body upon this earth he brought that body under subjection to the one that was inside of him all right until he come to doing only the will of the Father he comes through the adoptions he comes through the the different stages and brought him out to the position to be you know God Emmanuel here upon earth all right but that was not the finish of Holly had in his mind that's that's the thoughts of mankind you know that that he'd come to do this that's good it is right he come to do that but he had other thoughts he had a healer Savior deliverer you know and all of the attributes alright so he made a way in that person we called Jesus the flesh man to be our brother to where he could give his life then it could come back and dwell in you and I giving us the new birth all right now that would make God's dwelling place or a tabernacle to be into you and on as we were ending up the message talking about that we are the body of Jesus Christ upon earth now because he doesn't need a body his his body is laying on the throne there in heaven not I don't think he's laying lifeless you know I've never thought like that he's got other things to be doing he's up there preparing for us a place to go to according to the scriptures alright that he's preparing a home or a future home or now but the body is not here on earth physically because if it was then that would be as the Prophet said the end of all things and you can't have that because see even the body of Jesus Christ does not come to earth he comes downward and we meet him in the air right all right then we go to be with him then we all come back to earth together into the millennial reign all right now see but that new birth then was provided a way you and I could become the sons and daughters of the Living God to accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior bringing life into our soul making us that place all right but that's not the finish that's not the finish of all things that was the point that he had that he wanted and desired but he that was not to finish the finish is to bring this people God wants this people to become so much under subjection to him until we will walk off this earth in a change of the body all right now that's laying before us that's always been there and watched that as we attempt a little bit this afternoon but we'll pick it up next Sunday more to talk about the fact of God and how that he can bring these things to pice in you and I all right now see he's built the temple he built the tabernacle built all the time build a body come and dwelled in the body gave His life to come back into you and I that puts it in a beautiful position by the new birth but that put us into a situation to her that we just had eternal life in our soul because our body and spirit is not eternal the new birth is not the birth of the of the body or the spirit is the birth of the soul all right so that was not to finish according to the plan and of God of Christ mister God revealed that he had a plan and purpose that was - he was going to see it achieved that was to come into a people to word that he could have the preeminence in that people and could walk in the people in a in a body that he would have the finality of the finishing up of were that we would come to that place cause you see he went through the place of being made eternal his body remember was not eternal he went to a place that it was eternal so then that leaves a position - you and I are are are behind a little bit we need in other words what we need to do is I springing out it to N we need to try to come to the place that he can take over and take us into eternity all right now so then thinking about that we are the temple of God and we are the people that the end of all things according to the Bible is come upon you and I to bring us to the finish of it all and the finish of it is is God coming and living in you and I you said but I just don't see how that that we can do that that's the problem you're like Eve you're saying it can't be done and I agree with you it can't be done we can't do it so then the statute of a perfect man is building exactly what it is it's building Jesus Christ in you it's not building you and you we just get another you and that would be too good huh but it's coming to a place to work that he will live in the people now listen brother Brian said that God wanted to prove to Satan that this bride would not fall like Eve fell in the beginning all right and see them to do that he's put us through the test putting us through all of these situations and things that we thank you notice in this morning we said will ain't nothing going on if you had what you think you got then something big going on well I wonder how he felt when he walked in life whenever turned ever movie made was somebody trying to trap him trick him harm him do all of those things you know see we only look at the glory of what happened you know our dead was raised or sick was healed or something you know we only look at those things as because we're putting it upon that but we need to put it up on say seeing what the word says you and I are to be all right and if we are to be him made manifest then how is that to take place we have the message to tell us how we have the things as we'll get for Canada and see then we'll get to a little of it but what we need to do is just to yield ourselves to that one that's within us because he yielded himself to the one the body that he dwelt in yielded over to the one that was within him you know I mean he wanted to come off the cross right he prayed you know not if it be thy will he wanted to get off of that cross he was a human being but yet he said and with nevertheless no thing he's so yielded himself until he yielded himself to death right Robin they come death come up on him and then he was brought up resurrected and changed and that body was made eternal okay now in that being then he became the total dwelling place of Almighty God but that that he became is what he wants us to become right we're going to become right here whether we think it can take place or not I've done no business of mine I just take the Bible we are to come right here somebody will why can't we say we're them somebody's going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye why can't we believe that we're the one see we've got our eyes our minds set on higher things instead of putting it upon what God says and let it be simply to walk in that he walked each day he didn't have to get up he's always try to illustrate it Jesus didn't have to get up said well I'm God so I guess I better act like him today no he just went about his day of being who he was all right we don't have to proud a matter of fact or something you remember that in the statue of a perfect man and many times would he saying it we don't have to try to manufacture something all we got to do is just let him take care of it there's the secret of the whole time yes for brother Dale you ain't told me what I can do then nothing we can do the only thing we can do is believe what God has set through the prophet and you know yourself words that I go to and all of that that we're gonna come to a change of the body yeah this body's gonna put on the portal and mortal life right here because it has yielded itself to God we must just yield our bodies let God take care of it let him take care of all the things the Prophet said it'd be automatic right not just automatically done because that where people don't know it's to be automatic it's to be that we yield to him we surrender to him our being to where he can come inside and then come outward through us all right remember the other day the message we were bringing how that the virtues will be made manifest through your spirit out to the body to where that mankind can see you know that part all right it'll have to be something that you and I are going through all right now we are a triune being just like he was a Tryon being and he wants us to yield ourselves to him to her that he can manifest itself through us to bring us to the place that we need to be all right now as I was saying get the point now the new birth in the soul makes that soul to be God's vessel or a place for him to dwell but he's wanting that to be brought out into the body yeah all right now you tell me what else it is I'm just serious I'm not not sarcastic or - I'm just putting it plain you tell me what else it is why is this or one of the other one here no I'm just making it plain as I can to you what I believe I believe God wants for people that will just yield himself to him not try to do all of it but just become what he wants us to be how problems you're gonna have problems all your life you don't think Jesus had problems the Christian that's just part of a Christian how many times it Paul said he was in the fountain of the deep that he was bait not three times Spira one rod which would have killed him you know and different time and yet he was right in the middle of the will of God if anybody was yielding itself to God to let the inside man look leading was the Apostle Paul as far as us human beings right and see then it's not a to being a Christian is not being well are we just boy they're nothing don't bother us we're Christians with us no many are the afflictions of the righteous put the Lord lead us out of them all how can you go through child training in adoption without being going through child training you know right how can we be there see see we'd say what do you expect or what does God expect us to do all right just what he done he brought his body under subjection to the one that was inside of him and that's all he's expecting you and I to do God wants us to get his nature dwelling throughout our entire being come on now now you're getting a statue of a perfect man with right because we're too pro-gun potaters as we read of His divine nature how do you become partakers of His divine nature by letting that nature come and dwell in each one of us yeah but I just don't see we can make it well alright I agree we we can't but if we can yield to him and let him take care of things at least we can see a little hope there or sliver as we talk about it right now listen what I want you to think about today this afternoon is one thing everybody in the body of Christ is not the same because it wouldn't be a body I mean that's one natural point right a body got hands feet hands you know head body I'm different parts and everybody's not required what everybody else is all right so now those down to the ages right the disciples had these virtues your prophet said it right had to leave a little not from God they had these virtues all right but then the channel our way for that to come into being Satan come in and then wrote a dad and took it away all right now so then you find down through the ages the people wouldn't have the presence of these virtues in time to degree you can have this or you can have that you can be up and down one because you can have natural virtues you can have blood around said we have two different kinds of faith two different kinds of virtues two different kinds of knowledge all right and he said people how these things without even having a new birth you know people that are good neighbors they're good people they'd do anything in the world for you you know they're just this is just everything but they're not Christians and they don't even claim to be they're just human beings well if that be true that they could attain that by just natural things what about you and I with the eternal life within us and the ability to achieve what God wants alright now we've been through this over over over I'm gonna mention it and then this pull back and keep on going alright we have the right I mean we have the God has a plan and a purpose God has a way that he's going to do things now and by doing it the way he does it it takes away from you and on and gets us out of the way all right he knows what he wants he knows how to bring into pice what he wants all right now he didn't leave us blindly as I said now down through the ages it didn't take this this was not removed from the Bible of second Peter you know this taken out of the Bible and nobody didn't have it no but the way to attain unto that was lost now we'll get to it when we get over into some of it with knowledge in a different things like a especially in knowledge to see how that mankind has removed you remember where it says it on virtue he says the reason we don't have this he said because people don't teach it anymore well you said well how would that take it away because you're not going to try to attain them to it if you don't know it's dark I'm asking you a point do you believe that the virtues of 2nd Peter are required no requirement or do we just gonna have hazard Li float alone well what do you mean I go to church I do this I I pay my tithes I do everything what else you want me to be I just want you to die to yourself that's what a man said I start work one day you know and he was kidding Fred Hooper's what I think anyhow there was a time when Jim Jones that took those people down you know and they all drank the poison and paint and they was kind of making light of us you know as Colts and and one of them said to Blues Fred or somebody you know they said well you know there's the Sam ever tried to get you to kill yourself he said ever service he said ever service he preached you said all he wants me to do is die to myself well that's a good point all right but you see now listen the way was lost let me say it in another way the faith of the fathers was lost the revelation of the Apostles and things died and went into the ground will you follow that channel all right and see that was the stature of a perfect man was what they were teaching and that went down because mankind stopped teaching that it was a requirement because that would be the way see the church would tell you today you go to the church and and they say well we'll watch the requirement we don't have to do nothing just come pay your tithe be a good person will everything's fine yeah well that's a good well and all like that but God has requirements and we're going to how to reach those requirements you know why would the statue of a perfect man be in the Bible if it was not first not required for it to happen right why would God write it in the word if it's not required all right number two if it's in the book it's required right number one you see it number one if God required it number two it's in the book all right if it's in the book God requires it how are we going to get out of here what's going to bring a change what's going to bring a rapture we've had 50 years since the prophets going you know they're going away as a prophet you don't think see that's why you come up with the ideas and thoughts of saying we're all artists don't see nothing going home we had more back yonder in Pentecost and we got now what you want to go back there come on what would be the difference in Pentecost and the true Pentecost now I'm a firm believer in Pentecost I'm a firm believer in a true Pentecostal experience i am i believe justification same case in the baptism of the holy ghost bringing the new birth is a Pentecostal experience I'm just not a Pentecostal there's a difference between a Pentecostal blowing it all out two horns and all of the things and doing no type of thing than to be a true born-again believer to me there's a vast difference in the two well I would happier back Doc's will go on back side no problem yeah no trouble it's going back if that's what you want but if we want to go on to a change of the body then let's hang around it might happen but it'll happen cause somebody catches the word from the Prophet in the things to bring all right I didn't mean to go this way but we're going with it we know what that according to 327 of the church age book that this messenger of Malachi 4 is to do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to reveal those seven thunders which is the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turns the bride back now I'm perfect exactly word for a word from what the Prophet is saying all right so what do we need we need to fight for the father the statue of perfect man is the faith of the father all right so if we need to fight the father how do we get to fight to the Father come on us just like the Prophet said we say we need virtue how alert you well how you gonna get versa oh we need knowledge okay we can read that but that's not hitting knowledge none of those virtues are natural things they're the virtues of Almighty God all right so then God has given us the way he brought us a prophet come on to fulfil Malachi 4 all right that Melek high 4 is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers is that right John the Baptist turned it one way this end-time has to turn it back to another and technically taught John never turned nothing the we use those terminologies and words as we're discussing there at lunchtime just a little see we say John turned to miss what no John did actually turned ton didn't even have a message all John was it introduced Jesus Christ that was the faith of the fathers that stood the faces of us he introduced the faith of the Father he didn't turn it it's just our terminologies our words that John turned them this away and then this mess is gonna turn them back that away no Jesus Christ was that see what are you looking for brother I'm looking for Jesus Christ become visible among a bride and do in the end time what he promised to do if I can find the promise may I quote the Prophet this one used to hit me hard he said if you can find the promise in God's word he said you can call him on the scene now if you need this and I'll be glad to get it for you he said and if he don't produce what he said said you can call him a liar now that's a direct quote you can call God a liar if he won't come on the scene and do what he said it well I prayed and he didn't do it how do you prost him wrong you don't approach God as a demand there's no such thing don't demand God to do anything remember I told you about the guy there at work he said this is Pentecostal brother he said he said I I quit trying to do command the Lord I just started commanding the devil no excuse me he said I quit trying to command the devil I started commanding the Lord I said what he said yeah the Bible where it says commands you me I said that don't mean you command him I said that means you asked him and that's what he said he said I quit commanding the devil I done got over that said I started commanding God I went I walked away and I didn't have much more to do with that feller because I figured that if he had already got through with commanding the devil he was a whole lot ahead of me because I hadn't got to that place right and I know number two I certainly wasn't gonna try to command God so when it says commands you me it doesn't mean command like I demand you do it come on may I quote your prophet when it happened with the the little girl what was that something happened anyhow he said he had told us the lady he said you're not going to die and she told her mother remember she said mom I'm going home said yeah we're going home to Marco got to you she said no I'm not going home I'm gonna die run around him when that was finished up he said to God he said God you owe me an answer he said because you told me to tell her you told me to tell her she's healed and I did and said you owe me an answer he said you don't do that with God he said he let him pout it out for about three months then he come to him and he said now I'll explain it to you did you go back and check said she's supposed to died like a year before and a place where she'd almost drowned it and said I gave her that time to extend her life the worst he could get straighten up and become a Christian then he took her off don't try to command God on anything ask him maybe we're not doing this stage but this age is turned but we didn't command our momma's and daddies do thing now all of us here today told enough to know we didn't command our parents you tried to commend my mom I seen her whooped my brother when he was 18 years old with a metal ring off of a wooden barrel and straightened it out and let him have it you didn't play with mom you didn't command her she took care of you okay but listen jerks getting to the point the faith of the fathers was lost to the ages because mankind never taught it that's the main thing it wasn't taught of mankind it we need these type words it talked now that we need these things even after coming into the message even after the Prophet telling us we need it if you read statue of a perfect man you heard him in there say these things are required well maybe you didn't read it something went wrong were you reading he said it's required like I said if it's in the book it's required right see then we know how to do we've got the right channel the profit brought the message the seven thunders sounded through the prophets message right and those are to be the things that literally turn us back yeah those are to be the things to literally turn us back now there's another stage to that that I'll withhold until Sunday there's another part of that that we're turning down God has placed within our hands his truth he has give us the message he has give us everything that he said he would give us to fulfill the job but why have we not attained could it believe could it be that we're doubting his way I'll leave it to her let you think on that because brother Branham was talking in the statue of a perfect man and he said these people wasn't required what these people was required come on read it see each one of these ages has got their own part of the word alright but each age is not required what the other one is required right because they're individuals just like all of us individuals I said a moment ago we're hands were feet we're eyes were we're not all required to be the same but we are required to yield ourselves to be God's children all right down through the ages he brought his church up the same way that he brings the people up so Peters said here temperance patience garland there's no than the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place right where we ended this morning what is his dwelling place now a body thou has prepared me what's he working on me and you to bring us to a place he's already given us in the material number why kept emphasizing they see Solomon didn't have to worry about getting material God had already seen to that even though he turns around to David and he says David you can't build me a house and do can hook up my feet hurt just go if that's the way you're gonna be about it just go ahead then we'll let Solomon y'all live together no the very minute that he found out he wasn't gonna build a house he calls in all of his people remember work and start saying we're gonna need this we're gonna need that David was more in control of building that the temple than Solomon was Solomon's just assembled what David brought together all right and see that's where it should be with each one of us instead of getting our feelings upset because God would say something to it what Wren said oh no it's better than a yes a lot of times you ask God for something he says no he's child training I like my brother Gary Atkins he likes it and brother who was it brother sister I'll get it in a minute buddy huh she Curtis or she if she had a spoon about that long a little paddle it was back time and them kids didn't fool huh because you get that little paddle and she'd take care of it brother Gary says she knows how to raise children he said don't want knows better how to raise children is God because he knows how to raise us he's got to say no to us I remember what I've done I've told you over and over and brought them old priests in 60 71 he preached at you a perfect man I asked him I said brother vote now on no one time how do I get these virtues it's a requirement that I've got to have them so I've been dealing with this for a long time a requirement of getting the virtues and it was like in 81 or 82 when God spoke to me and he said those words that this messenger of malachi forced to do these two things if you're going to get these mergers there's got to be those seven thunders yes but brother tell only the Prophet can come up with the thunders I believe this prophets already thundered forth God spoke through a man to you and I to tell us all the things that we have need of well I just don't know where that will do it or not well then what are you don't going to do it with right you don't think that that's God's way of doing it well I'll give you the pulpit tell us how to do it we've had 50 years stumbling like an ear come on get up here tell us how to get these virtues because according to the Prophet we got to have them and he says they're going to rapture we got album no I'm not sarcastic hey for the water I'm just truthful I want to get out of here hey I'm 78 and I'm wearing out wonderful for God to do that and I thank God for all that he has done for me and how he keeps on doing but I want to get out of here you know and he's already told us how to do it he said these the Prophet America forced to do it when we believe the prophet of Malachi 4 but the Prophet Malachi 4 told us some other things that we'll get to all right but these wasn't required what these were required everybody ain't required down through the ages they wasn't required to how these things they were required to be Christians and do the best that could do for the day an hour why cause Malachi 4 had not been restored look how for was not restored down through the ages you really was falling away but there was no restoration down through that because they kept falling away from the word gradually coming back to bringing things for the truth all right but now think about it if an age is not required something then God just moves on he winks at them lets them go through the ages and thought he doesn't beat us to death about the reason we don't out like if he don't require it but then when he comes along to require it then he tells us hey it's time to do it now it's time for somebody to do something I mean we folks we done run out of time you younger ones can say well we've got time but you ain't got much time huh see these ages they come down through that and as they did according to the prophet then on the statue of a perfect man what does he say look at number two attaching a perfect man you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us all right these people died in here are depending and way doing us well so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection no you need anymore the Prophet just told you somebody's got to come to the perfection well the hint and homeless can be perfect I've heard that's a long time sick of it my lord we heard that in the Baptist Church I didn't know new doctor than the message we ain't all perfect we all forgive one I remember that tag number and I hate him I read tags on cars and they're on the back of a tag one day and it said I'm I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven I said they don't even know don't go home look up the word forgiven the word forgiven this means it's wiped away and ain't nothing I okay and their souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller and the minority these refers to the chalkboard and owner it's the same kind of a ministry that this left because when the headstone comes back it's got a little pocket little flames at Cal for it to go the church has got to be home to fit we'll get into that I don't want to cover that too much on this this to the point that they without us cannot be made perfect all right now listen then I say it again like I did a minute ago they without us could not be made perfect all right now if there's on us there's a possibility for them to be made perfect right if there's a people that can receive God's Word there's a possibility that this thing can take place do you not believe that you're part of it what are you here for Phillip you now we've got a job to do we've got to become what God wants you to become and listen look at number the bottom part of number three okay but each age then we got it now get back up to the other about the governor 357 there you go and the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things nice talking about the virtues right is that what he's talking about in the message the virtues that's what it's to be now look but it cannot completely completely be completely controlled till it completely possesses these qualities now what's the qualities the virtues alright what's going to bring a rapture what's going to bring a right play for somebody to come in to these qualities these virtues these things all right go ahead now we know according to what the next one is that the Holy Ghost is not correctly talked cording to blasts Aeneas ninth and see that's what people today well we can't be this and we can't meet it we're just sitting around waiting on God to do something we don't do something boy one of these days maybe he's gonna do something well now what's wrong with us believing that it's here now what's the what's the problem what's the problem with us believing that God has already sent us the prophet of Malacca forward to bring us the message he's already brought the message he's not got to come back and bring the message he's brought the message all right now why are we concerned about it see yes he said and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with it that's the statue of a perfect man is the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're born again at faith right but the growth development it's the statue of a perfect man which is the Holy Ghost dwelling in you so all we need to do is make sure we get the Holy Ghost all right then from there we can expect a growth development with the way that it's been so incorrectly tell you well you believe the mansion's don't you so you got the Holy Ghost you don't cut your hire word painter you don't mend oh how long hire no and what we're in the message we got the Holy Ghost they had that in Missoula Street and then you can argue your Pentecost we've had that you won't argue right come on they had it they had to hire in the closing addresses and everything was right they didn't bring the rapture you say well you don't believe in preaching against women dressing huh I believe you don't have to preach about women's dressing higher you need to preach for them to get the new birth if they get the new birth it'll take care of the higher and the clothes and the men and all of that in the other all the men and their clothes and their dressings are doing and everything it'll be taken care of by the baptism of the holy go that's why it's incorrectly tall well if you get this you'll quit now you don't have to quit nothing that's where the trouble is you go try to introduce somebody to message and the first thing you've got to quit Clinton you hire to be a Christian I don't like you a Christian that's aftereffects come on I'm sorry but listen why did the Prophet come to do and trying to just get a point to you of what you're looking at because these things are required go ahead with number number five we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build on our build organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ why that they might be the powerhouse of the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his words he built up the individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but building individual two sons and daughters of God that's the idea the add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge and now well you're coming into a place what is it the Prophet was sent to build individuals to build individuals into the stature of a perfect man the powerhouse by his word that's what he was sent for but what do we do we turn it down going over to paragraph 178 of the same quote Christ born you into it see they buy your faith see you're regenerated and born into it and then after you're born into it these are the things that he expects you to add just keep adding them now you're going right down the line he expects you to add know God is expecting his people to come forth into these things he's given us the way he's made everything according to that and he's expecting us to do it listen to what we're doing go ahead and number six [Music] if I'm a Christian of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the true baptism with the Holy Ghost now listen and you got these virtues that's talking about when it comes up to the point everything brought into you see the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues filled in you then God Leo's in the tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God has got and you might do that but until these virtues here go into you listen you're still off the real true foundation of faith in other words if they don't come in us then our faith would be wrong all right but when these virtues grow in and you add that to that then you are a living monument you're a living moving hotle that's what God won't know what brother Dale I just don't see how we can become anything we can't but we can yield to him and let him take care of it we can't do anything or sell order know that but we can yield ourselves we can hinder him from doing what he's wanting to do what these virtues no matter you might even speak with tongues whatever you do but if you're not a living moving Idol get a point then we'll pick up and think on border number seven taken from the statue of perfect man now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in see now that's the new birthright coming to faith going to live again now you put the blood of Jesus Christ and we know you don't put the blood of Jesus Christ in the birthright he's explaining it in spiritual in natural terms what is to happen in this virtual riot now you've put the blood of Jesus Christ in sea and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ in other words your total dependence was upon him and that brings his faith and the virtue of Christ the knowledge of Christ the temperature Christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controlled you and your feet is the foundation controlled by the head to learn your there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues what's going to bring about God's Word and bring it into position that he wants it to be go into the break all these off the statue of a perfect man so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues and then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and cry that's a man full of virtue or knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of God of the Holy Ghost E and there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a condor sweeter godly or person you're sealed of sealed shows on both sides whether you're going you're coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses the this possesses this then that capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost so if we don't have those virtues ahead stones not coming right is that what he's saying if these virtues are not there there's no headstone well right now according to the Prophet now how long you want to stay on that a quotient there's got to be the headstones got to come to the body to take it through he can't nothing can happen without the headstone coming the headstone is love the capstone to the pyramid is love if these things are not in us he can't count us off so he's waiting on you and I write waiting on us to get straight and get it right let's read this one then you'll pick it up a thought maybe go ahead a number nine and you'll pick up a thought that we're bringing next week that working me let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out then I might be able to teach those where God has said in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and bring in all of these virtues into it for that perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are material off of that one this is material of this each one of these virtues belong into him and they're pouring out of him down through them the other words coming inside of you what the fivefold ministry is involved in this all I want to say is a word or two and then we'll pick up on the rest of the thought going he has brought us the message and he's waiting on you and I to you know believe that message well how can we hear without a preacher an attic and he preach unless he be sent right now according to P Ephesians the FIFO ministries for the perfecting of the science I wish you would go home type in apostles prophets pastors evangelists pastors teachers top in the five ministries and see how many times right around talks for the fivefold ministry but yet everybody thinks yeah okay brother branham has got this brother Browns got that but they don't bring the ministry in now all I'm gonna say this and then we'll pick it up Sunday Moses got the pattern in heaven right and Moses came back to earth and delivered the pattern of how to build a temple but show me one place in there that Moses ever done anything now I'm not saying he debt and I'm just making a point I hope you get it you see it wasn't for him to do anything it was him to give the orders the people was to carry that out Moses didn't know how to saw a board and do this that and the other maybe he didn't know how to make this out of purple and how to make this out of that he depended upon the people to manifest right he was dependent upon somebody else Moses what it wasn't for him to do a lot of work Solomon wasn't out there with a working he was in charge somebody else was doing the work what are you trying to say I'm saying that the Prophet bringing the message to the endtime bride is very wonderful we believe that without that we wouldn't be nothing but without the fivefold ministry you can't make manifest what the Prophet said that's all I'm saying will prove that the Lord willing next week and some thoughts and times that maybe we'll cover it deep enough for you to do but listen Church I want you to look at number three go back to number three a few oil brothers gonna make sure I got the right one yeah go to number two and then we'll go to number three look at the word that the Prophet he's got so roll over to about 370 where we can save reading and all of these risks the stones and the pyramid they're lying so perfectly until you can't run a razor break between weighing tons in there how they got them they don't know but they will and what up here the period cap pyramid that does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be home not only just some creed or doctrine or something others we could we come true it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ that when he comes he and the ministry will fit my right smack together then will come the rapture they're going home now let's watch the next quote go ahead and number three Refik to halt but each age has placed these things into his church and pattered it by showing these things each individual has these possess these qualities and watch him and this being when it's completed this person that comes to these virtues when it's completed what is the Church of God going in the rapture that's a group that's all of us together and this being and completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the garage sure glory see what I mean there you are there's the full-time what would he tell rapture into it you know rapture come on ever born-again believer listen to the message now ever born again believer ever born-again believer that's truly born again we'll go into rapture because that's the Word of God it's the rapture why is he bringing this down here in the rapture with these possessions and that you realize what he's saying if somebody don't come to perfection to bring this thing to Pais there's not going to be a rapture I changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye somebody's responsible they without us cannot be made perfect that's in the stature of a perfect man we'll get to it Sunday more on the point but I'm born I want to get is if there's going to be a rapture there's got to be rapture in faith right rapture and faith is rapture and revelation somebody is going to come to a time to be changed and to be changed the moment wink of an eye right Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout border Archangel wrong in the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord you realize there's got to be a resurrection before there can be a rapture change I've snapped my fingers to illustrate a change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye ever born-again believer goes in the rapture because the rapture is inside of you when you're born again somebody's gonna come to a place if not we're just gonna keep on going somebody's gonna come to the place to understand what this message is far I told you the first phase of it that's what the messenger of Malachi for Luke 1730 we turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers but without a fivefold ministry how can it take place Rodale you're putting your dependence on the fivefold ministry I put my dependence upon brother Branham okay well no problem no trouble we I'm not gonna argue in 0.3 I'm just gonna say what he said it you show me what you got and what it says and I'll show you what he said I'll show you what the Bible says the Bible says the FIFO ministries for the perfecting of the son the Prophet said to fifl ministry is for the perfecting of the sons yeah but we got out with no that's your thoughts now I ain't arguing with you and your thoughts or what you think I'm just saying what the prophets say it I've made myself plain and clear there's going to be a resurrection come one day and we're going to be around here for about 30-40 days from the time of the resurrection to the literal changing or going away we're going to not call each other brother Dale I've seen dead raised have you seen that ever I seen dead raised but I don't believe it I don't tell me we're gonna be sitting in this building dry died and half asleep and everything else I'm talking me to come on and the dead starts walking among us I'm just not in that category I think it's gonna cause me to either run out that door or get to running up and down these aisles or do something don't you come on you see your mom your dad come walking in you mean you I'll glory we found it that way we done it now I don't think so we got two pictures downstairs or the young are the people in their younger years if they walk among us we know what they look like right that's how much I expect them I expect them to walk among us and for 30 40 days you can have run around in the preach 24 hours a day seven days of the week for that whole time that's fine with me but we got to get dark according to the Prophet according to the Bible they without us cannot be made perfect see we don't put the confidence really do we have our confidence built in with the Prophet being the Prophet I'm asking your Krishna do we have our life is everything at stake of the Prophet being the Prophet I mean we really believed this was it you see two whole church is leaving it now that used to swear by that there's like I said this morning that a lot of them churches and other than people in them churches is what brought us into the message right and yet now were they at you think they believe the Prophet was the prophet of Malachi 4 no they wouldn't be going the way they're going I don't need to be explained doesn't it they wouldn't be doing it you see but there's more to the story because see the fivefold ministry has got to come in there I didn't write the Bible where it says Department of ministries for the perfecting I didn't write it God wrote it it's up to him take care of it now listen I've always been playing with you too there's a lot of the people of this message that called himself ministers I wouldn't walk across the street to listen to I have been coke when I walked in the building and there's preaching I didn't know there's preaching and I have been caught like that yeah okay but you get what I mean I ain't driving about the country to listen to somebody that I can't agree with well because I don't believe that part of the fivefold ministry well who are you I'm me who are you that's not that I'm not trying to make nothing of the fivefold ministry I'm trying to do it I'm trying to let God make it I ask you some questions your while back about the faithful ministry do you know that the fivefold ministry is predestinated above the nine spiritual gifts the nine spiritual gifts is predestinated by for knowledge but the fivefold ministry as gifts by for ministries gifts to you and you're not going no higher in your pasture so just some of you yeah so long because you're not depending upon the ministry but see it's got to be or else you tell me the pulpits yours for you to tell me what's going to take place or what I did I've made myself clear over all of these years I'm not trying to build anything I'm trying to tell the truth I've always believed the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the science I've always believed what the prophets say it he said these young men oh I'm breaking it down big nuggets maybe some word or some if you he said but they'll take over and break it on down for the people I believe that you believe the fivefold ministry is infallible I don't believe brother Branham was infallible I know I believe his message is infallible but his message is not the white horse rider being the Antichrist or this Christ or that Christ you know the name saying the white roads writer was an old ago that's not infallible but his message is infallible but there's a lot the human element said that's not infallible I've always been straight on that there's a lot brother Brennan said we were discussing that at lunch but her brother said some things that are hard to be able to understand I believe it was Paul that said they wrestled with it to their own destruction I believe in a FIFO ministry and I believe that the church is not going to go without the fivefold ministry bringing the message with that prophet brought the message to you and I it's not that we've got to find something in the message that's a hidden secret or we got to find this or we've got to come up with our own ideas if it is the messenger malachi for look 17:30 didn't do the two thing you see that's why that I always read to you what I can to show you the Prophet said it cause I want you to hear what he said and then that way at least you can say what he said what he saying but the human elements of each one of us is our problems or our problems the human elements that we are but only thing I'm asking you is one time do you believe these virtues is required they were in the Word of God are they required of you and I I believe they are well then how we're gonna get them we could at least follow the pattern or thoughts of the Prophet that the Prophet was to bring us the Word of God and he done his part now it's left up to the fivefold ministry to take that and bring it on not to bring something new see there's where the trouble is that's what the biggest portion of the ministry that's message done they want to bring something new they don't want to stay with what he said they won't bring something new mm-hmm we don't need nothing you I'm happy where I'm at well I don't agree with you brother on this come show me where I'm offering the word don't come to me so what I don't like your attitude that ain't in the word attitudes you got them I got them that ain't in the word maybe the virtuous will take care of the attitudes all right but some come and show me where I'm off the word that's all I've ever asked anybody to do but I've had people to turn to walk out these doors they would not dare tell me where I was off yet they've told everybody else where I thought I've at least asked you to stay with me and tell me because I believe that God can use the ministry to bring us to the right place that's why I rejoice when these brothers Minister I hear them trying to explain something from their heart that God has spoken to them because I believe it that's part of my living now quote brother Branham will the bride have a ministry that's a direct quote will the bride have a ministry the a spread around he said sure he said she consists she consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers he said the fivefold ministry consist of that you know what you are what I teach what do you like it or not these brothers that it went out and ministered they just Minister a little bit and they go out there and they start telling them about what's believed in this church you gonna find out you ain't going out to her very much no no they all say that's where brother Dale at least everybody knows what I believe I don't have to be peter-patter around about it they know what I believe yeah but do we believe these virtues are required if we do then we've got to have them if we've got to have them how do we get them that's all I'm asking how do we get them if we got to have them is this some automatic push-button thing about this or is it a growth development in Jesus Christ which one is it let's stand together as we go into the communion think on these things because we believe God's Word God has given us all of these things he's placed everything in order I believe he's given us what we have required you know what's required of us God has given it to us I don't believe he's got to come back and give us some other requirement I think he'd give us the requirement and all we got to do then is just rest in the requirement and try to do what it says what would be hard you know I mean wouldn't that be something for me to go to brother Donny and said rather Donny my transmissions Torah would you tell me how to fix it then he'd say well first you gotta pull I don't want to do that you've got to go I don't want to do that well I thought she wanted you to transmission things I do but I don't want to do that he says well you ain't gonna get it fixed unless you do that am I gonna change my own way of thinking or am I going what am I gonna do let's get into the main seizure Paulding corinthians says for have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance with me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest I said in order when I come let's have a few moments of just salat prayer praying one for the other and asking God to lead us remembering these that are traveling and the ones that are going to count and all of the people and not being here today remember to each one
