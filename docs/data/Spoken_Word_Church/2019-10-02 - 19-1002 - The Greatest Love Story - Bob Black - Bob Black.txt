words who our hearts and into our lives we pray we ask these things in your name Lord God that you'll be with us Amy so let's go to the Book of Ruth chapter 2 we'll start at verse 1 and they only out of kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth of the family of Elimelech and his name was Boaz and Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi let me now go the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hat was to light on a part of the field blowing unto Boaz who was at the kindred of eliminate and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was said over the Reapers whose damsels is this and the servant that was said over the Reapers answered and said it is the MOBOTIX damsel that came back when they only out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house then said Boaz unto Ruth here still not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from thence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do read and go thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch see and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn you may be seated the Lord at his wrath blessing to the reading of the word so we've got here a scene that this whole this whole Book of Ruth is in just a few very few chapters and it but there's so much packed into this little short little book because I it's it's a story about really the greatest love story that could ever be you know brother Branham said in in why little Bethlehem in 1958 he said he's talking about talking about the Lord and how it compares the Boaz and everything he said he knows all things and he works it just to be right and there Ruth married Boaz and when Ruth and Boaz was married if we had time to go into the great story there which was one of the greatest love scenes of all ages when Ruth and Boaz were married you think about great at what a great scene for Ruth that somebody that a normal Israelite would not even Rick or just somebody that came out of a fart kind of heathen the MOBOTIX and she came into the land and and and there she was gathering gleaning in the field and Boaz looked at her and and began to fall in love with her as he as he watched her and he began to notice her sincerity and her humility that she was willing to go through whatever it took she was Milton willing to Humble herself and do whatever it took to get a blessing hey you know a lot of times we come to church and we kind of get into a place where we kind of start going through the motions it's just kind of you know it almost comes becomes almost like a routine but really the the purpose the reason that we come to church and the reason that we hear the gospel is because there's a love story that's unfolding and I believe that the preaching of the gospel is not just to not just to maybe just kind of beat the people or to fuss it people over or to maybe you build a minister up or all the different things that you know that go around the world and but but what the preaching of the gospel is for is to get people to fall in love with Jesus Christ you know we say so much about what we try to explain maybe what a revelation is and well what what that means to get a revelation from God but a revelation is really God speaking to you that love language when you read the Bible and but you begin to read between the lines and it begins to unfold you that's God speaking to you that's God's God speaking to you from his love letters this whole book is a love letter from God it's a love letter from the bridegroom to the bride to show you how much he loves you into to unveil secret things secret mysteries to you and show you of himself and so the message the gospel is not just something somebody coming and explaining to you until they can almost kind of beat beat you over the head with a good explanation a good explanation and all of a sudden you become submissive to it you say well they could explain it better than I can and so maybe you know maybe you maybe you have some questions in your mind maybe you come to church with things that you don't understand and maybe some I can just maybe present it to you in a way that just almost brings you into submission but that's that's not what the gospel is about the gospel is a love letter to you the gospel is a revelation is not just education and that's one of the things that one of the very early things that I experienced in my in my Christian walk is you know you could point fingers and say well brother Bob you went to college because I did go to college I went to college and and because of that because of that III know what an education is and what an education brings and I know that this message is not an education you don't get close to God by by being educated into it you've got to you've got to learn the message and you've got to read it and you've got to understand it or something but it's something so far beyond just somebody teaching you like like that like going to college and and and and and explained it's not it's more than just a good explanation it's a love story that's unfolding to you and when you begin to look between the letters of the the letters of the page and begins that love story begins to unfold to you you can begin to see the great mysterious picture of God becoming real before you you think about think about that that story but there brother man I'm told of the the our Lord Meatpacking man that that you know it's a really simple story but there's so much depth packed into that little story of how that that that man he came he came to the ranch where all the girls were decked out and all they were trying to attract me and they were they were decked out in a way that would be attractive to any normal worldly man but this man that came from the armored meat packing company he came and he was looking for something different he wasn't just looking for a world ago a girl with her face all painted up and wearing pants and wearing things of the world and and not busying herself in the kitchen or all those things that go along with being a real good gospel Christian lady but he began to look for character and and I believe in any true man of God will look for character just the same as Jesus came looking for character and and and the character that God is looking for is his old Word made manifest and a bride so when he began to look he began to look for that character when was identified when he identified it in this little girl he came up to her and he began to have a conversation with her and he said I find it and you equality that I want some virtues and you gotta find these virtues and you said I don't see and all these other girls and he began to team it promises to her and brother Branham even talks about in one and one sermon he says he kissed her and he had that kiss that promised to her that I'm gonna come back for you I'll come back for uni and a year and he told her to be looking for him and it was in the evening time that he returned back because brother and talks about how the clock began to she looked on the wall and all the other girls began to make fun of her and the and the clock began to tick down and but she had confidence that he was going to show up she had confidence that he was going to make his appearance and when the clock was it almost looked like timer to run out and as they began to laugh and make fun here come the stagecoach come rump rolling in and I believe tonight we can hear the rumble of the stagecoach come rolling in it's it's it's time it the evening hours at close at hand the light is falling and as the whole world begins to laugh and port mocking and make fun we're we're here for a purpose we have a purpose and we're waiting and watching for his for his appearing because it's it's a love story you see in Philippians chapter 1 verses 9 through 10 it says and this I pray that your love may abound it yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that your love may abound your love for God your love for one another may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without the fence and the day of Christ and sincerity is one of the things that we begin to talk about on the way back from the men's meeting and one of the things I want to talk about tonight as we kind of get into this what's this Serie T has to do with with with this journey because it's a relationship and you know whenever when you're entering into a relationship a boy or a girl and any kind of relationship when you're stalking beginning to talk about matrimony it's a serious thing you don't enter into things haphazardly you know the world the world does the world ender internet enters into engagements and things without even given it almost a moment's thought but this is not something for a real Christian person to do is we should you know brother round talked about before you make an investment you should think about what you're investing in you should consider what you're getting yourself into before you take a step you should consider what what where you where that next step is going to lead you what's your final destination is going to be because the gospel brings you the gospel brings you into a personal relationship with God so many times we we want to we come to church and you know what we get we get in love with something else other than Jesus Christ we forget that this picture down here the pictures up here these symbolize what the main things should be that's what the thing is that we should be looking at but instead so many times we will fall in will fall in love with like the ministry I remember one of the ministers meetings a while back a really renowned brother gotta I'm not going to name names or anything because it was a minister's meeting and sometimes those are closed-door things but he began to speak about how you just can't get away from the fact almost sometimes that that when you come to church people are gonna fall in love with the pastor and you understand the way I frame that people fall in love with the ministers they're there to see they're there to fall after a particular kind of ministry or they just get so wrapped up in the way that the particular ministry brings is less than everything that they're just focused so much on that minister and then they lose sight of the main thing and the main thing is Jesus Christ or or maybe they get big is so in love with fellowship that they love being around other other Christians and it's just a wonderful to get into in that environment and get in an atmosphere of just worship and all those kind of things get around other people maybe that can pass out business cards and get a little association get a little thing going and this becomes almost like a club but maybe it may be maybe you know sometimes ministers almost can get to a place where they just kind of get in love with study we like to find new things we get to like to find bring new things out of the Bible and we look to for what way isn't that an interesting thing share that and then maybe begin to build ourselves up and say did you see that before I wonder I wonder if anybody else has seen that before and so we begin to fall in love with that or another thing this is something that I struggled with early on in my Christianity my Christian walk you can begin to fall in love with the anointing and you just want to get in that atmosphere so much you begin to you get where you you want to pray and all those kind of things and you don't you forget what the main thing is the main thing is Jesus Christ we're here not to just fall in love with this ending that routine or not just enjoy each other's fellowship and although those things are good and those things are needful but the main thing is Jesus Christ and it was love it's the whole thing is about love love is what caused Adam Adams love for his wife to go out and try he made an effort to save her and love was what caused him to go out and you see one of the things that kind of greets me is to see people that don't have like man that don't maybe not have a true love for their spouse but women that don't will have a true love for their husband either I feel like that's one of the things that maybe has people have forgotten about this day that we're living in how to really love one another and I believe that you can't really love one another until you have the lover inside of you how can you love one another unless you until you have God on the inside to show you what real true love is because real true love is not expecting something in return love is expect as loving somebody even when they hate your guts love is loving somebody when they don't wash the dishes love is loving somebody when they don't pick up their shoes love is somebody loving somebody when they don't do what you expect them to do that's what real love is if you hear sometimes man they'll say well when my if my wife were to pass away I would quickly go out and get me another one I would replace her why would you why would be destined to make such a remark about my wife don't you have love for your wife don't you have a feeling for her or is it all just based in carnality I wanted to speak playing tonight but I believe that a real Christian should be somebody that knows how to love we should love what another we should love our spouses we should love our children we should because that's what the whole gospel is based on Colossians 3:19 says husbands love your wives and be not bitter against him love one another church brother bring them in the darkest hour then Jesus comes along he said but you see the Bible you'll never learned it in the seminary that might sound awful flat but the Bible said God said he has hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal it to babes such as will learn is that right he will reveal it to babes you don't have to be smart to understand the Bible thank the Lord thank God we don't have to be smart you have to have a humble heart why do you say you have to humble heart because it's a heart condition it's a problem with our heart when we can't be born again it's not God's problem it's our problem that's the problem with our with our hearts too why we can't move up the statue of a perfect man it's a problem with our hearts in our homes why we can't love our spouses while we don't while there's bickering among our home while we're fighting with one another it's a heart problem that's the problem you have to have a humble heart brother Branham said the Bible is God's love story to his church that's hid from all the scholarships in the world it's only knowed by one scholarship that's through nian ology if you ever had any of it you know what I mean down on your knees you have to read between the lines to make it right in other words you can't be educated into it you can't be tall into it and I'm not saying we don't need teachers and all that get get the right train of thought that I'm trying to bring but the way that you'll understand the Bible the way to get a revelation is to fall in love with Jesus Christ and make sure that your heart is right get your heart right be sincere with God come to God with humility come to God with a not lifted up saying you better come the way I wanted or I won't take it at all I came did become and saying that whatever way whatever is necessary I'm gonna do whatever it takes whatever you me to do if you want me to cut in the church every service if you want me to get on my knees until something happens if you want me to do what it whatever it takes if I need to apologize to my brother and if I need to go to them and apologize and affiliate myself in front of them then that's what I'm willing to do Jehovah Jireh in 1962 brother Brennan said now reading the Bible it's a love story that God wrote to his church it's God God is love do you believe that I mean the Bible is written so that the educated and smart can never understand it you have to be in love with God to be able to understand that you have to have God in you he interprets himself to you now it's just like I got a wife oh how I love her I love her with all my heart and I'll be overseas somewhere and she'll after she gets the kiddies to sleep she'll write me a letter and say dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight i'm thinking of you i'm riding seat i know what she's writing on the paper but i know her and love her so much till i just know her nature I know what she means so I can read between the lines see and God wants his church to read between the lines not read anything out of it now you have to read between the lines to see what its meaning now watch and see find out if it isn't now what God done with Abraham and Sarah he's showing them example of his church he did for them he turned them both back to a young man and woman sure he did both in back just like he's going to do every seat of Abraham no matter how old and brokedown you are see what he's doing right now and he begins to talk about Abraham Abraham and Sarah he's reading between the lines because the Bible doesn't say plainly that it turned them back but it does say that that that King down in Egypt he began to won't have a turf or a wife it does say all these different things about the situation and all of a sudden they're able to bear children again so you can read between the lines if you've got that teacher and you know what it's saying and when you begin to read between the lines you can look in the story of Ruth and you begin to pull out things that maybe are not quite apparent like there's three stages in this story when you read the Bible you begin to understand the Bible says things over and over in patterns and when you begin to read the Bible you begin begin to look at those patterns in Scripture and it begins to speak to you about the day and the hour that you're living in it identifies the place in it where you are in your life where you are in your journey that there is a journey all those different things so let's read between the lines this afternoon and look into the story of Ruth and see what it's saying because the story of Ruth says that there's there's three stages here there's Ruth deciding there's Ruth gleaning there's Ruth resting and you remember the last time I was talking about the three stages of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's three stages to a believers journey justification the about sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this story starts off with Ruth deciding and I want it tonight maybe get in a little bit deeper because I kind of left everything maybe left you hanging the last time we we stopped in the Holy of Holies in that last that last sermon that I was preaching but there's more to that I read you with that quote where brother Evan said after you get the new birth there's more of that so let's come up a little bit higher let's go a little bit deeper and find out what other things there are what what other things there are besides besides this kind of ground floor level this the story of Ruth starts with with with it a promise and they always telling her making a promise that she would have rest she says in Ruth chapter 1 verse 8 and 9 it says and they only said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to our mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband that she kissed him and they lifted her voice and wilt and it came time for Ruth to make a decision she had to make a decision whether or not she was going to go back to the comfort of her what she knew what she was acquainted with or look for that rest you know many times you fight you remember look back in your journey and remember when you first heard that there was a place of rest a place of refuge a place of rest for your soul and and and maybe it took you a while to finally make that decision just like Ruth did she battled back and forth but then she she left off on that journey and she began to follow naomi down into the Promised Land Hebert's for 911 says there remaineth therefore arrest to the people of God for here that is entered into his arrest he also had ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief but there's a there are levels to this rest you see because the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5:23 24 and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful as he that calleth you who also will do it and Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart in other words you've got a soul a spirit and a body to work with there's three things that that God is in the process of bringing to a redemptive state he's already paid the price but the problem is there something in the way of you receiving that redemptive blessing and what it is is your heart your hearts got to be dealt with and first of all he begins to soften up that heart then he gives you a new spirit so that you can deal with yourself and then he gives you his spirit and you're inside of you but then there's still heart problems there's still heart problems that brother Branham preached to us about when he preached the doors and the door of the door to the heart the door don't want all those all those different sermons about there are different things within your heart you have to keep opening open up every door every door of your heart because God doesn't want to just give you the new birth he wants to become have complete dominion over you he wants to be Lord of you he wants to have a polina thority over you he wants to be able to use you in the way that he wanted to use Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden but the problem is your heart is in the way what what's he doing he's drawing you to oneness of unity to the marriage of the Lamb and I believe I believe tonight that is something to get sincere about if you can catch the revelation of what God wants to do in your life and what God is doing in this age that's something to get this serious about as a young man that wants to propose to a young lady and it's thinking about the type of engagement ring and it's thinking about where he wants to take her to the wedding what kind of home but you know God has thought about all those things too he thought about the proposal he thought about the wedding he planned out the wedding supper and he planned out your home because he's got he said I go to prepare a place for you where I that where I am you may be also and he's got that New Jerusalem prepared brother when I'm said to weigh exactly to your desires to your desires that maybe you don't even know about he's got all that prepared that's something to be sincere about I believe tonight we should be so sincere that we'd be willing to do whatever it took to get there not just the new birth that's not what I'm talking about but I'm talking about adoption you know what tonight I almost titled this sermon the price of adoption because there's a price that you've got to pay and the price of humility the price of is a seer life the price of dying out to yourself that God may have preeminence and you let's go back let's go back to what I was talking about in that last sermon I preached what does that journey from the outer court to the inner court to the Holy of Holies because I stopped in the Holy of Holies but there's more than that your whole journey though is based on what happens at that outer court the atonement is offered the sacrifice is offered do you know when brother Branham was approaching the third pool and he he said he began to have he always had a problem with mark 11:23 oh I think that's the right scripture the scripture that says say to this mountain be moved he always and he said I would preach on that and I would pull back because and he said I even wondered if that was in the atonement he said I don't see that in the atonement or maybe not worded exactly like that but is it in the atonement he wondered is it in the atonement because you see that what happens in that outer court the sacrifice dying Jesus died for you everything is in that atonement but you may not see it it may not be open unto you as you climb up the statue of a perfect man as you agree it grow in grace and knowledge there came one day a realization that scripture opened up to him and he began to realize what that scripture meant that that was in the atonement but you and I have to realize that that scripture is in the atonement it's not my education I can educate you tonight and tell you this in in the atonement but it's a love letter to you that you've got to see for your own self God speaking to you personally this is a personal walk a personal revelation to you you cannot go in based on the Kotel high riding on the coattails of your pastor or of a minister or any man of God or anybody that you see walking this walk you've got to go in personally personally you and God alone there's a love relationship between you and God just you can see when you get when you go into that holy of holies you're there like brother branham compared it to like the bedroom you're in there in that bedroom the receiving seed receiving the word like but but you see like so many creatures today we think we think well I just want to stay in that holy of holy with the curtain closed around I don't want eat it I don't want to go out and like fellowship with anybody I don't want to go and you know there's that there's like this movement this movement that's not just coming on the scene but it's been around for a while now this isolationist thing that that well it's going to be a secret thing a secret catching away so I'll just make it I'll just kind of help God and I'll just isolate myself and people go off and they live alone live by themselves don't come to church and you know that's one thing that's one example of isolationist but you can also do that your own self well you want to just you don't want to fellowship with anybody you and I just kind of keep yourself all alone but you see there's a mystery here a mystery in the Book of Ruth a mystery throughout the Bible that after you come into the Holy of Holies you got to go back out you got to go out to the outer court again you got a and what's happening is your soul doesn't leave that inner court is that the Holy of Holies your soul is still in that Holy of Holies but now God begins to work on your spirit your spirit is in the outer Court and he begins to take you through what three pools of your journey do you see God did not call you to isolate yourself God did not call you to just sit at home and stream but God is calling you to fellowship one with another God is calling you to take what you experienced in that Holy of Holies and bring it out to share with other people because what's going to attract people to the gospel is the fire you are the light of this gospel don't hide that light you are the you are the light to the world you are a light in your church you know you know many of us maybe wonder we come to the realization that when you come to church it's not so that other people can be alike to you but it's so that you can be a light to them now I believe sometimes people want and people want to come to church so that they can have everything their way so that the music can be played their way so that the preacher can preach on their pet scripture so that the preacher can see the things that maybe they've been thinking about about personally dealing with and they want it their way and they want their somebody to be shining the light on their path but the way that it should work is you should come and bring your light you share with other people bring your light and humility and meekness not expecting others to do for you but for you to do with them and then that will have change so when you change your approach to church it'll change your approach to home life let's see see you get to preaching like this and people begin to wonder well what about you bill ah but you see you see I've got to walk this walk to I've got to do this to brother Branham when he when the angel came to him and said you must be more sincere it wasn't that that was the way for him to walk the ministry has to walk more maybe more than us because we not only are speaking it but we've got to walk what we speak we've got we're gonna be held accountable for the words that we say if we just say just vain words just repeating after another what what greater condemnation will befall us but we've got to walk this walk and so I'm preaching to myself tonight I'm not just preaching words just like smack somebody down but I'm preaching I'm preaching a message of deliverance to my own self tonight that I've gotta walk this walk and this is a walk that we're gonna walk it in build in and there's a serie to come to a place where God can bring us to speaking conditions to a play you know that's another thing I think looking back through time you see so many brothers and they almost been getting a race to come to speaking conditions let's see you can get there first why so that we can point fingers at the other and say ah haha look look I'm at a higher place than you that's not how you do it you'll never get you'll never get there trying to be better than the other but you'll get there humbling yourself and lowering yourself down to where God could use you and whether it's a doormat somebody just hold don't hold the door open for people or maybe just actual doormat where people can walk all over you and use you and say hurtful things about you whatever it is let me be the kind of person that God wants me to be in this age that I might fulfill his word the Bible says in Ephesians 4:29 32 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that have administer grace unto the hearers and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption so you're sealed in that Holy of Holies but you can grieve it your soul is sealed in there but you can grieve it I think that's kind of a mystery maybe maybe something we need to catch on to that they're still there still can be heart problems in your life even after you get the new birth even after the new you get the new if you begin you can begin to fall into that routine and you can just turn into grunt you grumpy old grouch where everybody you just want everybody to do what pleases you and you begin to like brother Brenda said you get to a place where maybe Satan could come along and Crown your life at the end I don't want to be like that I don't want to be like that work where whether brother that brother had talked about that that he got to a place where he just said I'm not gonna serve God anymore being born again he was born again and he went out and began to die to drink alcohol and God had to take him off the scene because because even after you're sealed with the Holy Ghost even after you're born again you can grieve the Holy Spirit you can grieve it what we're supposed to do is climb climb to the tocut what is the token the token is God's wedding ring we're talking about love aren't we the token is God's wedding ring to you it's a sign to you that you will escape death and this our sign is something that was preserved until this age a special revelation that God gave us in this hour what is the token let me point to the token on this chart so that you can see because I want to be real playing the night so that you can see what I mean and if I need correction I'm willing I'm here if I need correction bring it on but the token the token that could make it not receive that token message down through the seven churches because it is the capstone message a special revelation to you a token message was was preserved until this age because if if the token message had been given in any other age they would have taken a body change because that's what the token message is the token life is answer as your you can hold it up like this wedding ring and say it's my right it's my pass out of here it's my pass to escape death and you can step over death with that token when that capstone revelation that will that was given in this age that's what they took it that's what we're climbing to through that wedding ring but Ron said if the Tribulation Period catches the bride his own wife in the tribulation no sir the blood of as Christ has cleansed us from all sin had net wouldn't that reveal under the sixth seal you ain't going in the tribulation and there is no more purify and the blood of Jesus Christ and that token as identification that has been purified I mean that's the token of the Bible wearing wearing the ring but you see see we're getting to a place because after you go through outer core inner core Holy of Holies then you climb you keep climbing and you go out and you continue that process that's what most of the fighting most of the fighting is in that holy place because you're fighting you're trying to keep the lap stems live you're trying to you keep studying you're at that table of shewbread studying as you climb you're you're at that golden altar offering a praise is praying before God confessing confessing your sins confessing what you believe you're saying you're praying like near mine like Ezra did Oh God you get all the walls are down but Lord God you made a way for us and that's what that's what all is going on in this holy place as you're climbing because you you you you're not staying in that holy of Holy's but you're coming out yet and you just keep moving on up I hope I hope this makes sense I hope this is all right mother gramma said it in the angel and the Commission he said this is well coming kind of get into the meat and potatoes of the message when the angel gave him his commission he said he looked at me and he said do not fear for I am sit from the presence of the Almighty God said to tell you that your peculiar birth and life has been to indicate that sure to take a gift of divine healing to the peoples of the world and said now listen if you'll be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe you nothing shall stand before your prayer not even to cancer and then we'll skip on down he said a seventh grade education poor how could I ever feed the world local little Baptist preacher there in the city he said if you'll be sincere when you pray so what I'm really talking about is how how are we supposed to get to this place where we get to speaking conditions how can we get to this place what God can have confidence in us how can we get to the place where God's lips that wedding ring on our finger the token how can we come to the place where he says he's just like the father where the Holy Ghost reports back and he says he's just like you and and you come to a place where God has confidence in you where he's willing to give you the car keys and let you drive a little bit and I believe if we read between the lines a little bit we can begin to look and see what God's requirements are God's requirements he requires us to not be lifted up within ourselves because he said 7th grade education there is meeting this angel and he says he begins to reflect on his qualifications he had none he had no qualification what qualifications do you and I have we're like the Moabite us we have no qualifications we're not great people but we're the poor and the uneducated in there and the off scour of the land we have no great genealogy that we can point back to and say well look at me how great I am he said how could I ever feed the world the local little Baptist preacher there in the city he said if you'll be sincere when you pray because what what did brother Branham stressed so much he said the way up is down and not at a greater witness he said and when you because it can become nothing in your own sight you're becoming something in God's sight then how about that and always remember this friends the way up is down he that exalts himself shall be abased but he that humble himself shall be exalted so just love him with all your heart and forget all you've ever known about all of the things but Jesus Christ just go ahead and love him and work for him serve him if he wants you to be the doormat well you just be the doormat but you see so many times the human condition and the problem with our hearts makes us swell up with pride and makes us want to exalt ourselves and makes us want to know more than the other person we get into situations where we got preachers mocking other preachers we were looking down at one another and people in the church say well I know I know more than that minister I believe that I could know a better way to run things maybe then the pastor I know of maybe a better way to do things on a better way to run run the ship then and we begin to exalt ourselves and we begin to be maybe look at ourselves as the one that maybe others should come to to seek counsel if you all counsel come to me instead of lowering ourselves and saying if I can do anything to help if I can do anything to help then let me let me be there for others you you know brother Brown said husband's should love their wives as God loved the church but you know a wife should come to a place where she comes into a headship she comes unto Authority and the church is supposed to be coming to a place under Authority she's she's coming and humility like Ruth did to boas there where she humbled herself and allowed him to cover her with his skirts allowed him to say I claim you and she came in humility and I think maybe let's get into the home life a little bit let the Holy Ghost meddle a little bit tonight I believe sometimes the problems is we don't we don't allow Christ to have preeminence in our lives and the sisters maybe don't allow don't allow their husband to have them you know that such a problem I know more than my husband and I know more or my husband knows more than the pasture I know more my husband we got if we could just realize that God is the one that we should we should be seeking instruction from what is humility brother Branham said humidity so many times we think humility is just like wearing a skirt and needs to be rode with a skirt like I almost like a I like a CC fire thing like humility is humility is not meekness or not not just humility is not just allowing somebody to run over run over you like that but humility is being when Isaiah he said let's think about all the prophets that said that they can take when they approached God they were in awe of God they were in all of his presence they were their whole motive and objective was in taking care of others not in and having somebody to take care of them but doing for others not for having them to do for you for in putting other people first in Matthew chapter 23 8 to 12 it says but be not called rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren my if we could look at that and the picture like that there were all brethren instead of trying to lord over one another and trying to be the one that provides all of the inside and all of the counsel and having all the information and being able to provide all this or you know putting ourselves above one another he said you know what a rabbi is the way that they call rabbi I looked it up the Jewish terminology for rabbis my great one my honourable sir a title used by the Jews to address their teachers and honor them when not addressing them putting them putting them way up on high on a pedestal and it says and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted to humble yourself means like to set yourself at the last place at the feast like it says in Proverbs to let somebody else put you up verse in Proverbs 1812 it says before destruction the heart of man is holy and before honour is humility in proverbs 22 it says by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life 1st Peter 5 says likewise ye younger submit yourselves under the elder yea all of you be subject one to another all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give us grace to the humble oh I like this atmosphere right now it feels like there's a cutting edge a cutting sword everything almost feels a little bit awkward in here that's alright I believe the preaching of the gospel needs to be awkward sometimes Philippians chapter 2 says fulfill you my joy that you make that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind and lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves my goodness to come to a place like that do you realize this is a requirement for your brothers and sisters to come to a place where you esteem the other better than yourself you come to a place to where you realize we want what you're lacking and there's nothing good about you but all of it all of its good about you comes from God it's not a holy people but it's a holy God dwelling in the people and that makes them holy that's what Colossians chapter 3 says put on therefore is the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye that's the mark of a real Christian a real Christian comes to a place where there says so sincere so sincere that they're ready to humiliate themselves or do whatever it takes I'm brother Branham in 1950 he said he said again I told you people now remember I told you people I said he told me if you'll be sincere see then it will come to pass the you'll tell the people the very secrets of their hearts and the things that they have done in their life that's wrong and so forth if you'll be sincere with what I give if if you'll be sincere then see he didn't his ministry didn't begin with him telling the secrets of people's hearts but there was a place and if you go back and look I was trying to find the quote before I come out couldn't fine he talks about a woman in a gray suit walking up to him and a plat on the platform and all of a sudden he marks the day and the hour see God knows the day everything's moving according to a chronological pattern he knows when things are gonna happen there and there's an actual an actual time and a place when things happen when when there's a time in a place when you got the newark new birth and there'll be a time in a place when we take a body change but he said he looked and he saw that woman in the gray suit began to walk up and all of a sudden he began to tell her he began to know what was in her heart and why did that happen because the angel had told him if you'll be sincere if you'll be sincere with this what I'm giving you now not just run around and make a big show of it not make it like a big magic show or try to build you up your own influence like he saw all the other ones doing all the oil Roberts's and all the different ones that they wanted to build themselves up and build great big followings and all of those kind of things that's what brother Branham said about sincerity and what hairstyle Elisha he said today we could shout we can scream we could speak with tongues have signs and things but where is that sincerity if so sincere about the Word of God and the Church of God until it grieves our heart to see seeing going home and the message all the things he said oh you said that you're taking under the Old Testament brother Branham all right let's take the New Testament the Holy Spirit warns us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith what does that mean that they just get to where they just come to church and they want to be a big shot they want to come to church and they want to be big maybe they want to be I want to be a minister because I they've got this perception that that minister is a big shot instead of administer as one that ministers to others a minister is one that's lower than the others because he's the one serving the food he's the one coming around with that little conflict over his arm saying can I get you anything is there anything else that you need the one that you call in the middle of the night and wake up like like I've heard people calling their their pastor in the middle of the night mmm I don't know about this pastor but because their dog has fleas and stuff but see that's what a minister does he's there he's there to minister to your needs no matter how silly may be or how far-fetched but he's there to help you not to build himself up I don't know where that came from have a form of godliness but we deny the power that with the right thing having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir God hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it it's powerless but any religion that Christ in is under his own blood and it's got power in it you say God hates the religion without power he said your solemn feast is a stink I guess he does hate it he said it makes me stink sick thank you I think I read that right it makes me sick oh so let's read a little bit further down there he said God hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings we're real worship not forms how does sincerity bring we're real worship because if you if God reveals to you what His Word says then you really know how to worship a lot of times people just jump her like Paul said bodily exercise profiteth little just hop it around a lot and running back and forth in the church what does that profit but if you have a revelation of his word and he reveals to you the Grace and the power and the church and all these thing and his word opens you then you know how to worship then you know the correct way to worship that's why sincerity bring his real worship genuine power to worship that you know to know that you've passed from death unto life let's read another one just once more once more Lord 1963 brother Graham said let's stand up on our feet everybody let's skip on down to paragraph 147 drunk on the spirit if the Holy Ghost can just pour into you till your so drunk you forget what your name is do you forget all your doubts get you so drunk on the spirit do you forget your doubts amen the then you can get somewhere with God then the cry wants more goes up from the sincerity and then another one hallelujah filled with the Holy Ghost these drunk on the spirit God's righteousness and holiness and power get you so drunk too you forget who you are you're nothing to begin with remember God wants to come into you once more Lord once more once more the Lord yet so you see the problem is a hard problem the problem of getting up to the adoption is a hard problem the problem of getting the new birth is a hard problem let's let's go to that definition of what sin serious that I pulled off the internet free of this simulation honest honest when you come to God in prayer are you honest did you say there's really something wrong with me god I need some help from you when you come to church are you coming with honest worship or are you just coming just to see so that other people can see the way that you dress and the way that you act are you becoming are you coming with an honest mode of and objective for God to Tabernacle himself inside of you free from adulteration pure a pure heart isn't that what God wants a contrite a pure and a contrite heart a heart that is ready to be molded a heart that God can work with marked by genuineness so now we come to the second stage of Ruth's journey because in Ruth chapter two she's got to come to this place where she's sincere she's coming to a place of sincere worship and Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth of the family of a limo Lake and his name was Boaz an hour to read this to you so I'm gonna jump down to verse 5 this said Boaz under his servant that was said over the Reapers who's damned so is this he noticed somebody coming sincerely he noticed a woman that had humbled herself that had out down that was bowing down picking up the sheaves behind the Reapers she wasn't expecting the Reapers to just put it in her hand to just come over and just lay that's what we do a lot of times when we come to church we wanted it all in just one second we want the preacher just lay years and years of Revelation and a lap all at once and then we'll be able to well then we'll be able to properly evaluate it we think but we've got to humble ourselves and walk behind the Reapers and pick up pick up the little sheaves in a drop a piece at a time because it's labor like like like brother Bisco said when he was speaking of the men's meeting up there he said it could be a lifetime it might be a lifetime of work of picking up little pieces here and there and until it slowly forms a picture a picture of God's grace to you picking up sheaves and she was displaying character the kind of character that would attract a godly man she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the sheaves she didn't come with any demands like Cain did but she kind she came with a humble heart I pray you let me glean and gather and he said let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go without after them follow after them and pick up a little a little bit of choice and morsels that they leave brother Rama in the token he said do you realize I was almost seems critical to to kind of look and begin to that wonder where is there any sincerity is there any sincerity in the world today is there any sincerity left in the message or are we just kind of going through the routine until maybe hopefully I hope just based on hope that the bus will pull up one day sincerity is what will take us there he said I was watching this television was kissing catching the face of them coming to the altar kids punching one another he's talking about Billy Brewer one of Billy Graham's campaigns kids punching one another and fighting going along the altar and laughing and cutting up no sincere chewing chewing gum looking all around go right in there and say yes they make a confession and come back out Billy said you can have 30,000 of them in one year's time he ain't thirty left there's no sincerity left there's no more sincere and listen to how he explains this he said their people is not ready to confess they want to pray God you healed me do this or do that do that but when it comes to dying out and confessing your sins and getting right with God it is a sea no more that's the reason we don't see no more healings than what we have that's the reason I'm preaching these things let's get things ready for a healing service you've got to get the thing working first God heals you for its glory and we must be ready for his glory and you know you could you can begin to read a quote like this and like I was saying begin to wonder if there is any sincerity but I'm gonna switch gears for a little second and just speak to the young people that that are called I know many young people in here I caught up wondering if there's anybody sincere in the message today wondering if there's any even anybody even worthy to make a good message spouse and you begin to reason around that in your head you begin to reason well if there ain't nobody in the message because what happens is you go to camps and you see people laughing after people come through the prayer line well they didn't cry after they came through the prayer line and you begin to look at all the different things going on and you begin to wonder you begin to reason is there anybody still left out there there is still somebody left I'll say like like God told Elijah that I still got some preserved I still got some preserved and what you need to do though is you put your faith to work if you got faith enough to be born again faith enough to be saved faith enough to start your car in the morning put your faith to work and go to God and say God I know there's got to be somebody out there for me you bring them to me I'm sincere about it it's time to get sincere and if you're sincere about it there's somebody else out there sincere what we need to do is stop looking at all the other mistakes that people are made around us and say well because somebody some other people that I'm looking at in the church they went out and got a spouse out in the world then maybe I could go do that too look to the words as your example not to the other people listen I've made many mistakes in my life I've done many things wrong but don't look at the mistakes that I made and say well because brother Bob did so-and-so or did something that that gives me an example that gives me a reason but there's you've got a promise in God's word that God is able to imagine let God be your matchmaker God is the best matchmaker that there could be with so many times we try to get ourselves in with our little beauty minds and our reasoning anyway I'll do human faculties and we just messed everything up but what we need to do is like Moses mama when she put him in that basket and set him loose with all the crocodiles and alligators or whatever and said God you take a hold of him if we'll if we can get serious with God like that and get sincere and say God I want the Holy Ghost if other people are receiving it it's for me if other people can find good spouses and so can I thank God you send me somebody god will do it I'm a testament of that I'm not I'm not gonna get into their personal stuff right there but I that is my testimony that God is able you put you put your faith to work and God will bring you somebody that you can be proud of that you can love and the messages experiences in 1947 brother Branham said yeah hey this is the second quote in this whole sermon and it sounded like he was begins to talk about people wondering if he was too sincere about what he believed and in the messaging experience she said he says that I was too sincere about it that I taught thought too much on it set my mind on it too much said you pray for john doe's baby forget about it that's God's business to heal it said you just think too much sincerely of us said then when you do going to cause to have a mental collapse my nature is not what more like carrying on but I they told me that I'd have to forget about the thing I was too sincere for them I don't believe you can get too sincere about the work of God that's right more sincere you are the better God can lead you how about that the more you sincere you are the better God can lead you why because it's a heart condition I believe we need to get our heart set to where we're willing to do whatever God requires when we come into the church it's not just it just to kind of do something just kind of go to a routine and and like take our pill when we read our Bible with it sometimes we get an idea it's like taking a pill well I've taken the pill for my day I've taken the pill for the day I've taken my prescription no you don't read your Bible like you're taking a pill you read it like a love letter it's not like something the doctor you like the preacher told you we're gonna read one chapter and then you're done you don't read that and in this clip well I've done my duty for the day it's supposed to be a relationship with God you're in love with God and that's why you read your Bible to begin with that's why we preach we preach so hard about you need to pray and you need to be even you need to fast and all these things but you won't faster you won't pray until you get in love with God that's what makes you come to church that's what makes you come to the Bible study that's what makes you come to fellowship with other believers as your love for God not because somebody forced you you can't force anybody to be a Christian you can't force anybody to - you can't force anybody to love you can force your daughter to love another man you can't force your son to marry another girl you can't force people to get together you can't force somebody to be a Christian you cannot force you cannot force the thing it's my love it's not by force you see it's a heart problem I'm gonna steal this from another preacher that we heard on the men's meeting because they got to talking about so all week all weekend long they were preaching on David and Saul and Jonathan and how what is the difference between David and Saul and Jonathan why would God choose David when when he had he had murdered your I'd puts it so Joab put him out there and then withdraw your troops let him die out there and so I can take his wife my goodness what an egregious offence what a horrible thing what horrible things for Abraham to do to to send his wife over there into the into the Egyptian kings house and like just step back from the situation it seemed like what horrible things why would God favor David over Saul who just may be a few offences he he didn't he didn't kill the the enemy he didn't kill all of them he didn't he didn't kill all of the the bleeding of the lands the bleeding of the sheet well that seemed like a a really nice guy doesn't it seems like somebody that would be more favorable he it wasn't that bad what about Jonathan who who never did anything wrong he was a good son a good a good friend today but a good Christian or you know not Christians in the Bible because Christ had not come here they didn't even know the name Jesus Christ but but they were a good follower of in the Old Testament a good follower of the faith that they believed in why would why would Jonathan not have the preferred place but you see there's there's more to it than just being a good person there's a heart condition and God said I found and David a heart like myself I found it and David David's got a heart like mine somebody that that like when saw when they begin when Nate was Samuel confronted Saul he made all these excuses and made all these reasons why he wasn't wrong but David when confronted by Nathan he quickly admitted he was wrong and repented with with ashes and tears he quickly repeated and what what's the difference here the difference is sincerity the difference is humility the difference is this meekness the the capacity to admit when you're wrong I won't to do right David now that now look see the difference a lot of people think this Saul Saul went to hell but Saul did not go to hell David and Saul were both saved and see you see today you've got the same situation you can have the born-again believer sitting in the church now born again but one can go to adoption and the other will not because they are not sincere with God they just turned it into they just turn it into a routine they turn it into a place just being grouchy with a word or just hanging on they're old ideas and not willing to admit that the thing that they heard a preacher preach about 30 years ago that they're not willing to let go of they need to they need to let go that to move on in Acts chapter Acts chapter 13 verse 22 it says and when he had removed him II raised up under them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart we shall fulfill all my will a man after my own heart you think about what the price of sincerity is the price of a sincere walk with God like when Queen the Queen of Sheba Sheba heard about that heard about Solomon and she she paid that price of a long long journey on camel backs across the desert months and monster knee until finally she got word of the word of the hour was you talk about Abraham where God told him to separate from your kindred to separate and go go this would go down to the prominent like promised land I'm this separate from LOD and then cast out the bondwoman cast out Ishmael do you think that was easy but he was sincere he was willing to do whatever it took that was a sincere man of God that was willing to to go and offer up Isaac if that's what it took to please God because he was sincere it wasn't just it wasn't just a ritual to him it wasn't just a like some of these weaker ones maybe like Saul well I just won't kill all the sheep maybe maybe if I just don't kill Isaac then it'll be all right maybe maybe God will bless me in the way that he's promised if I just if I just kind of find a way to get it get it get by and again see I'm not saying you're not born again I'm not saying you're not a Christian but there's a there's a more required of us in this day to take a body change I'm talking about we're not gonna coach through a body change on a flowery bed of ease there is something required that is a price that has to be the price of your total total captivation to the Word of God and what sincerity requires is if you have something to make right with somebody you gotta go make it right James 5:16 says to confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much don't keep trespasses and sin covered up and be honest with God that's what sincerity is be sincere with your fellow man and be sincere with God be and you know a lot of times with we think by our own human frailty that we can tell whether somebody is sincere with God or not sometimes we can but we're not pleasing one another we're pleasing God God is the evaluator of our sincerity God is the one that we're trying to please doesn't the scripture say study to show thyself approved unto God not necessarily under man but to God you're trying to get God's approval God's approval is the one that we wanted you know even when I'm standing up behind this pulpit I want to I want to present the word in a way that is pleasing the brother Dale and and that will that will reflect appropriately what this church believes in but ultimately ultimately every ministers charge is to be pleasing to God and to preach it and sling it wherever it goes with it if it is if it is maybe a place that you maybe don't want to in your humanists but let it go wherever it falls because the Word of God will not return void it will have an effect and it's not the Word of God is not to be preached just to just a baby around and not just to just to build up popularity and things but the Word of God has a purpose that's to bring us into the stature of a perfect man in Psalms chapter 251 in verse 15 to 17 he says O Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth I praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it the eldest delight is not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou will not despise why because that's a heart that God can work with let's read a quote brother Brown said in joke 1955 he says while she was a gleaning in the field directed by the holy spirit to go into that field to glean then up come bow ass Boaz was a representative of Christ for he was the Lord of the harvest he was overall the harvest and notice as soon as he looked out in the field and saw that Gentile girl he fell in love with her why she was gleaning behind the Reapers that's what the church has to do pick up a little bit here and a little bit there gleaning and here she was and in the next paragraph and here she was gleaning behind picking up these little gleans and the lord of the harvest fell in love with her her being an alien what a picture my I just love that and then he said whose damsel is this and they began to speak and said it's the Moabite they come in with Naomi and he went out to her and spoke peace to her and said don't you leave this field God be merciful stay put don't be tossed about with every wind of doctrine stay in the word what what really is the third pool what really is the new birth to you when you enter into God's rest on the eighth day it is your rest it is God it is your rest because the the whole redemptive work has been accomplished and now you can rest and Ruth chapter 3 verse 18 Naomi says sit still my daughter until they all know how the matter were fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing of this day the bride is entering into her rest a place where she she's trusting what God has already done for us but but see that principle what I'm getting at here is the principle of sincerity follows you it's what will take you all the way up that journey when the angel went brother Branham down in there in that in that cave or wherever at one time he says a cabin I must I'll say cave because I can't believe that's where it was in a cave that angel came to him and said if you'll be sincere then I'll take you to the next step and then what happened further on in his ministry he had that dream of him he said I had a dream and I was almost across the river Jordan and then he had a vision when he woke up from that dream of a snake and he saw the snake attacking trying to attack him and try the serpent trying to bite him and and then it tried to attack his friend and he and God instructed him the angel instructed him on how to how to bind that thing but then after the vision concluded he said if you will have sincerity if you'll be sincere if I can read it and it was in the message to paradox where he talks about this he said you've been given power to bind him the worst irini and I said well God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere now he had already he was already sincere because the angel had told him to go to the second stage of your ministry discernment of the thoughts and all those things you must be sincere but now it comes time for him to be more sincere sincerity is required you must be sincere with God for and brother Brennan's responses he did he didn't say what I feel like I'm sincere already but he said well God forgive me for my own sincerity and let me have sincerity further on down in that message he said I looked at the serpent and he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and scroll on down to there other the other red text he said so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you because he told him you can unbind him too and when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and then when he did that that boy said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this in paragraph 2 Donny one of that same message he said keep scrolling down he said he's seen that serpent bound he said you have to be more sincere paragraph 294 he said that's what I'm striving for is more sincere and each one coming along this morning I try to think if that was my mother those women if that was my sister sitting back there if that was my arrest setting back there or one of my children sitting right there what if it was them trying to place myself in their position to be sincere to be sincere now let's let's switch gears for a second and let's kind of go into Daniel seven new weeks now don't be scared I'm not gonna I'm not going to go into times and seasons and all these things but when you get when you begin to look into Ezra and Nehemiah they begin to talk about how they came out of Babylon and they're entering into rest they're trying to get to a place where they can rest because what what were the why did the walls have to be erected again why did the walls have to be rebuilt so they could have rest in that city and when Ezra and Nehemiah came out of Babylon Ezra Ezra's job his role was to restore the correct teaching of the Bible Nehemiah job was to build up the walls and all the other things associated with that so that they could enter into that rest so they they could enter in and they would know what they were talking about so that they could have sanctuary in inside the walls of the city and notes so they would be safe now now you get when you begin to read the books of Ezra and Nehemiah Ezra and Nehemiah when they came out they began to get real sincere and so I'm gonna I want to read tonight just to kind of close on this the prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah to kind of illustrate what real sincerity is when Ezra and Nehemiah came out of Babylon and they began to come to this place where where they began to realize that the walls needed to be rebuilt that the people didn't know what the correct doctrine was they were living in sin they had they had married themselves to false unions and they began to get real sincere they began to get like you and I should be I believe in this hour so let's read in here my chapter 1 verse 1 through 11 and I'm not going I think everybody's doing real good and I everybody wait praise the Lord Nehemiah chapter 1 verse 1 the words of Nehemiah the son of Hokulea and it came to pass and the month she slew I don't know if I'm saying that right in 20th years I was in Shushan the palace that Hanani one of my brethren came he had certain men of Judah and I asked him concerning the Jews that had escaped in other words he was concerned about his brother I want to know about him which were left with the captivity concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there and the promise are in great affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also was broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire I believe we should be like Nehemiah was when he heard this words when you when you begin to realize that there are false doctrines being preached in the message that there are people that don't know the day and hour that we're living in that there are people that are caught up in their sin it should affect us I believe like Nehemiah was affected because we should be so concerned for one another we should be concerned about seeing in that church we should be concerned about our young people we should be concerned about our old people we should be concerned about the whole thing the whole economy of God and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven and said I beseech thee O Lord of God O Lord God of heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observers observe his Commandments let down ear now be attentive and eyes open that thou may hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before the now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my father's house have sins he's doing like David he's a minute he's not blaming it on God he's blaming it on himself and on his people on the people that he's with we are the ones that I've seen we have dealt very correctly against the and I've not kept my the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandest our servant Moses remember I beseech thee that word that thou commandest our servant Moses saying if you could transgress I will scatter you abroad the net among the nations but if you turn and he begins to he keeps praying a little now down here be attentive but but his heart is sincere to God it's it's our fault that the wall has been torn down it's our fault that the city has been burned it's not God's fault and so what did he do he rose up and with his sword in one hand and with his trowel and the other he began to rebuild the wall another in other words with sincerity of heart he began to do what was necessary so that the city could have peace the do you see how that fits into this after after all after the people have come out after all of these ages the people have come out not knowing what to do but when you hear the word of the law and you hear the message it's time to do whatever is necessary preach the gospel be in and see it a season out of season do it would go to the fields whatever we need to do to get the message out so that the walls can be rebuilt let's go to ends benign this is a little bit longer I'm gonna close on this so don't get worried his Ezra this is this scripture is about Ezra finding out that the people of God were in false union now when these things were done the princess came to me saying the people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the Canaanites the Hittites the Paradise from the people of the lands these these were followers of God these were not just people from from from anywhere these were these were I'll say it like this these are good Christian people these are born-again believers and he found out that they had let all that their heart had gotten corrupted by all this false doctrine it had kicked in and that's why Ezra such turmoil because he realized that these people need to be their doctor needed to be restored he got sincere about what he believed in for they have talked taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled himself why did they do that because they didn't know they didn't know that it was wrong they had forgotten they had been down in Babylon and they've been listening to all these Babylon has preached and all these things put all this corrupt knowledge in their heads but when they come out it's time for the Word of God to be restored to them and when I heard verse three and whether I heard this thing I ripped my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and my beard and sat down and started and that's a real sincere believer right there to be so affected by sin in the camp you know sometimes we just let stuff happen in our homes and let stuff happen in our churches and we just let it go by but if you want to take a body change it's time to get sincere about the Word of God sincere enough to where we sit like Ezra and sit astonished and he said then it said in verse four then we're Istanbul done to me that's then we're assembled unto me everyone that trembled at the words of the God of Israel not everybody was assembled only the ones that trembled maybe tonight sitting here in this congregation there are ones that do not tremble but I want to be the ones that tremble I want to be the one of the ones that's that that's that's serious sincere about the Word of God and having ripped my garment and my mantle I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God and said oh my god I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespasses grown up under the heavens since the days of our fathers he's looking back to the father just like you and I are doing because our faith is supposed to be a restoration back to the original faith of the fathers and says let's go to verse 8 and he says now for a little space great grace has been to show from the Lord our God to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place something permanent that I got may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage is that not what's happening now in this day you we've got a road there is a revival going on in this bride it is the rising of the Sun because we have been revived from our bondage just as they were revived from their Babylonian captivity for we were bummed and yet our God have not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the side of the kings of Persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our God and to repair the dedicate desolation is thereof and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem and now O God what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments which thou commanded by thy servants the prophets and he goes on and he goes on but Ezra and Nehemiah got serious because then in the next chapter says they put they put away all their wives they got straight they did what was required they realized that if if Israel realized that people could live that way then they were no longer conscious of what God what they were called out of Babylon for you know that's what the message in this hour is to do is to awaken our consciousness to what our purpose in this life is for they were not conscious of what what they were called out of Babylon for that or that they were offending God greatly you see we don't rejoice when we wait when we hear of unbelief or false doctrine of all those things and I'm gonna I'm gonna finish on this so the musicians can go ahead and and come forward but but see true love is sincere when you get up to the captain it's sincere because that's what Paul Paul illustrated that in the 1st Corinthians chapter 13 when he said charity suffereth long it's kind charity envieth or not it doesn't behave itself unseemly it rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices and the truth that beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things and all those things become because because it's sincere its sincere about is honest about what it is it's pure it's the truth coming up to the capstone and it will finish off our story the third stage of this message Ruth chapter 4 verse 13 so boaz took ruth and she was with his wife and when he went into her the Lord gave her conception and she bare a son why because she was sincere she came with sincerity I believe now is the time for sincerity if you stand to your feet now is the time for sincerity we said God expects total surrender total honesty total purity and motive Amen he loved the Lord tonight let's
