I never have asked anyway because I'm going there regardless of who they they have to pee you know any of these men remember that remember the fellowship meeting remember uh pray one for another I heard you say something about brother Howe would be in October so we got a lot of time to be praying and all like that sister Anna was able to come home yesterday and sister Mary's with us so the Lord's in the healing business in the delivery business and we believe it and thank God for it right amen if you'd like turning your scriptures of Romans 8 where we've been speaking from and we'll get right into the word Heavenly Father we thank you that truly we can shout on the healed of Glory about the salvation that you've revealed into each one of our hearts and our lives and we love you father and we thank you for all things and we praise you Lord now just come and speak to us on what to say this afternoon Lord and let your love be with us remember the sick among us you said you would send your word we believe you've done that so now the healing comes forth from the word we love you and we thank you have your way in Jesus name amen Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate what now to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more for whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I hope you will you know go over again and listen to what we was trying to say this morning I don't want to back up much but you know I believe that was a point that we needed where we were talking about the morning Stars you know saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy and we found that the prophet said that was in God's thinking that was in heaven back before anything whatsoever that was even before the Angels were created before anything came into being that was in God's mind that he saw but now being in God's mind he saw all the way down to the end he saw where we're at he saw all of the journey now we're going to this afternoon kind of start dropping downward to be able to uh come back down to where they were at you know if you're up flying in an airplane uh you know after a while you're gonna uh you you've if you're gonna land you've got to start descending you know and and getting ready and uh you know you start flying little breaks or at least letting off the gas so you know we're going to try to begin downwardly toward where we're at and I don't know how many services it will take but uh what does it matter if we preach from now to the Rapture uh I think it's a very good thing and I hope you caught the point that I was stressing at the end I know I spent I spent a lot of times too much time in the background I guess and not enough time in the actual of the point of what I'm wanting you to see and uh you know I pray that the background does that to set us up but see I believe that actually by being a part of God the eternal life now that we received by New Birth we did not come into the world with eternal life in our soul I do not believe that I believe you must be born again to be able to receive eternal life if not Jesus Christ died in vain see there wouldn't have been any doings we didn't need him if we already had eternal life but you know without getting back too much into the message part but see I believe then that that eternal life was a part of God and that before the world he could in his mind the not just look down and see so when we we start with a message here we're going to start with a point of saying something like this that and you'll hear me when you get to it that brought around and said God knew we'd fall wait but now when I get to one quote in here you got to hold on real tight because see because he said the original creation couldn't fall right so we're going to have to come down correctly to be able to get to the place to where that we can can see it what I believe is correctly you know and and God can help us all right but see being a part of God then if God saw the Plan of Redemption would it be any problem to say that we as a part of God the Eternal life that we have now by the new birth that that eternal life that we have in us actually knew the plan that's why that we've we've got to get to the word redeem you know that's what I'm saying I've got a long ways to go and I don't want to go too fast because sometimes I click over too far and telling you it doesn't work out but we've got to get to the word redeem and redeem means to go back where you came from all right see then we've got to have a place to go back to or you can't cover the word Redemption well see this just to go back as something God thought of just as a thought in you know God just taught us something he thought of a people you know well you know that would be as far as we could go and that wouldn't be redeemed right you understand see there's a lot of things that we've got to cover I say a few things to make your thinking go ahead but then you know you have to back up and and begin to think on about these things and to seeing where we're living and to see that actually what we were saying this morning that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation world the prophet said that would be when they would begin to see the Plan of Redemption but that was not an actual happening that was not a physical part it would be in God's mind all right that he could see these things and and know that it would happen before you know but he would actually see now let me say this and I'll try to get away from to me now to to think about an attribute of God he wanted to display his attributes all right uh that would be his thoughts his thinking about it and it would be more than just him thinking about it you know we get it in that we're thinking about something but see God doesn't have to think about it his first thought was perfect so then if he ever had any thoughts of being a father that thought would be eternal okay and see if these thoughts eternal then those who make him a father would they not be as Eternal as he is so then we in him and not in no other way we in him was not just his something he thought of I'm trying to get that part to you over and over we are not just what he thought of that would cause us to have a beginning if we have a beginning we can have an ending but if we're of the very thought that he had and that is us not just flesh not this part here but the eternal life that's living in US then if God now I'm questioning it to you if God knew the Plan of Redemption and we'd have to know he did you know right well you see when we was a part of him would not give us a contact to him more than we could ever think of in life we'll get around to it where the Prophet said you know and I quoted the other day he said you know and everybody else was going out and just Raising Cane and doing things said there's something about you even as we were saying this morning of what did Hebrews 14 or Hebrews 1 14. where those angels are ministering spirits to ministers to the hours of salvation I believe that when you come into the world as a baby that you that would ever be born again that God right there would have everything right in motion and he'd make sure that that come out right he said no he doesn't have to do that no he doesn't have to do that but he sure loves to do it he didn't have to go down to Sodom right but what'd he say he said I've come down to see if the things that are told me now who told him him things he said to see whether it's right or not that's why I love him so much he's not going to stay up in heaven he'll never once him attributes started coming this way that's what I read to you this morning he'll never be alone again once he in his mind if you want to just say it it's all the morning stars singing and the Son of God shouting for Joy he will never be alone from then on because he's bringing into being his people eternal life is more than just a thought or a talking for me it's a person and that person is almighty God now living in you and I you know multiple membered body which means that we only get a part right that Jesus had it all but all of our parts go together and make him see it then if we do then God had attributes he had thoughts he had within him the attribute of Savior healer and Redeemer he had done already because he knew what he was going to do and we get to it in a minute he knew we would fall oh but brother Dale I can't fall that's where the people of the message I'm sealed in Satan's sealed out I can't fall don't Crow too much right don't grow too much God just might let us know where we stand but just think about it now he wanted them attributes to be displayed right and wanting them attributes to be displayed we are now seeing right now come on now we we talked about salvation right we talked about being born again we talked about being Christians right but now since you've come into this message what has the whole thing been especially since you've been at Lula let's I decided to put it that away because I ain't nowhere else what's always been our thought around here Redemption salvation revelation until we become intellectual know-it-alls right right well just leave them alone darly just a bunch of intellect well all right at least we still got the same thought we've had 40 years I want to get out of here don't you all right then I believe we are now seeing the Plan of Redemption coming into view that I've ended up this morning saying see even at Calvary even up to their Pentecost the best Paul and him could do was prophesy of a time to come when the body would be changed there was no way to go into that he could only be a prophecy of a future event but a prophecy to Paul he could look down and see somebody being changed or something right well what's the difference in that and Paul and God looking down and seeing us redeemed seeing us shouting in our Redemption to realize we're redeemed I love that Psalm don't you I'm redeemed my love divine Glory Glory Christ is mine see under him I just put everything all right but now listen this is the thought I want you to keep in mind we are now seeing the Plan of Redemption all right now not just because we read about it and talk about it but being a born-again experience within our soul it's more than just being a concept you go down don't throw off on nobody if you go right over here and he may be preaching on chains in a moment a twinkle of an eye right but do they know what they're talking about or is it just knowledge that they have received we're not may not know much about it ourselves but somebody knows a little bit about that somewhere but it's going to take place one of these days and I just contend we're part of it all right now and if we're seeing now the complete Plan of Redemption yeah I know this is a funny way of saying it and I know I'm funny and I don't know anything about music so forgive me but the first church age would only sing their part you understand we just come through the church ages you know the second Church of age could just sing their part Satan got in and it went to going down right but when Luther came out he preached the just shall live by faith he was singing the song of redemption and that's what God saw in his mind before the world us singing but what about a group that winds up to be able to sing the complete plan of redemption I know Sister Gail don't mind me saying that but she used to sing in Atlanta Christian choir and they got where they're singing Father Son and Holy Ghost she just just lift hers out you know then she just finally quit why because you just learned it that's not right see it's the Plan of Redemption being made known all right now here's one I want you to lock in write it down or whatever God is we'll cover knew that we would fall but he couldn't just start off in any way to let that be he couldn't throw a sinner on the Earth and then say I'm going to save him he couldn't do it that way now the old argument of which came first the chicken or the egg you've heard that argued you know well now God never made eggs he made chickens it doesn't say that he made an animal you know he made eggs and they all hatched out to be chickens he made full-grown chickens all right so when he started the human race I want you to write this thought down in your mind he never started the human race with a bunch of novice little baby kids to grow up he started with Adam a full-grown manifested Son of God because no creation of God starts with a baby he said well it did when now come on with you receive the earnest that's a baby right why because we're in the fall see we're in the fall but when he started the human race he started with Adam and we'll get back to him after a while in the message and Adam was God's example son right he would love for all of his sons and daughters to be like Adam then when Jesus came he was the real promised son the real example all right write that down or think about it and just consider the point and you'll see when I get on the end of the message just a little bit you'll see why I'm emphasizing that because you go back to the morning message that eternal life that you have never had a beginning so did he start with children I'll let that Coast a little Adam was full grown Adam was his example son the fall brought babies right so then thinking about Redemption you wouldn't want to go back to a baby right just dropping little thoughts in for about 10 sermons down the road somewhere maybe you want to go back to a full grown so then Adam would have been his example son Jesus Christ was him but then in the point of thinking about being a part of God not thinking about peoples that's where we want to get to all this thing we want to get this ego we want to get this thing into being you know the eternal life that we have there is no such thing as a baby form of eternal life there's people who receive eternal life that all of us are babies right but you don't have and even apart is we'll get to it and keep on having to say brother said one little speck of eternal life is eternal life just because you call it apart if you understand why did John what did he do when he went to Patmos he represented the bride right one man with a part of God whatever the part does right she's gonna do are you with me giving you things to think about what you see Church nothing is pulling anything over on God and he knew all of this before by his foreknowledge all that would ever take place on Earth I had for knowledge he would know that remember what we said foreknowledge was knowledge before of something that transpires so if we were shouting in the mind of God it means we would have to come forth to be shouting in the physical right just little thoughts all right now let's begin just a thought this afternoon we've maybe re-read some of these but you know what we've quoted on most of it and we've been through it God couldn't make a man a sinner and then save him he couldn't make him a sinner so that he could come down to save him what would he make it out of how would he make a sinner he can't make a sinner he he wouldn't at all be saved right but he knew what would take place all right so let's think about this now as we start coming downward a little from the eternities and coming down to like he says on Christ the mystery God reveal that God had a plan and a purpose we've been over that he had a plan and purpose in order to let himself be expressed all right pull that nut brother I guess where the Bob's on it today okay pull number one up because I want you to read something try not to read all and do everything but he had a motive and going to the back part of God's mind we've been over that he had a motive into it in order to let him be expressed then when the moon it wouldn't start he wasn't even God he was actually actually wasn't God at the time because God is an object of worship in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was loving him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be savior in him was to be a Healer and all of these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God all right think about it now so to my opinion the first thing he's made was uh let's see go on roll it up the other way somewhere up or down one paragraph 105 is what I'm wanting us there Earth 104. background 104. that's what we want all right there wasn't no sun no moon no start or nothing and he asked Joe where was you when I laid the foundation of the world now my point is to think in a prophet getting a revelation from God about the Plan of Redemption the doings and right in the point that he's explaining the mind he's explaining the back part of God's mind he's explaining that God is eternal he's explaining that he had a motive in doing it to be his savior healer loving he turned right back and goes to job where was you when I laid the foundation world when the morning started staying together the Son of God shouted for Joy where was you that was way back before the Earth all right God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery so think about what it was paragraph 106 wrote it on up let's get that 105 excuse me God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever begun and how that it's unfolded now if it's the Plan of Redemption what I just unfolded itself right down to this present time that's what I'm saying the first church age could only sing what they could sing this Plan of Redemption is a seven full Glory of his person for each one of the ages to sing their part all right unfolded itself right down to where we are roll up number two look at it paragraph 168 Christ of Mystery oh the great revelation now now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin they'll think about what we're doing put them on free moral he could not make them sin and remain God he didn't punish them for something he made them do but what he put man on partnership with him and he didn't let him act as a free more Legion the same same thing he's got you at high on today acting well you want to you're a free moral agent but it's free moral agents to give you a choice all right then it would be necessary that if it was going to be a people that fall for him to come and pay the price he can't make us fall he couldn't make Adam and Eve fall he made Adam perfect his body wasn't eternal but it so was right made him perfect nothing couldn't be added to their beauty their doings or whatever and as he done that he gave them a choice and by giving a choice if I don't get back to it would have ran them on marriage and divorce he said see there see that's why the woman was not in the original creation because she was the first one to exercise her choice she was the first one to exercise her Fremont agency to choose wrong but then Adam chose wrong we don't blame Eve all together we just know that that's where it started but did he make her sinful you got a problem if he made her sinful but these are the words of the prophet he made her in a way she could do what she done amen right he knew she would do what she would do he knew if he left Adam in the garden there would be no sin all right so he gave him a help meet and that caused the fall all right but now what's the point I'm kind of here and then we're going to drop over because I want you to think with me a little I'm setting up the thought to where when we get to the way Adam was created first all right how was he created first a spiritual being so but we're over here getting lined up where you won't misunderstand me all right because I believe we must understand that God could not create us wrong he said well we just go to the creation I wanted it into your mind to stay in your mind that God couldn't create us wrong create Eve he made her beautiful made her right had she stayed with God there would have been no fall right right but there had to be a way for God to get this to going and how could he get it going and we're going to drop over and see what really happened we're going to talk about Adam in a way maybe that you hadn't thought about him but you see Adam couldn't fall it was the helpmate it was the bringing forth of Eve and now I'm telling you I believe it I believe Eve had eternal life in her soul and that's why I warn people oh if I got eternal life I can't fall you're right in the death trap of the devil to get you I say it this way by God's grace I won't fall he'll keep me and if he can't keep me he'll take me off the scene because he ain't gonna let me marry his name all right but it may be an odd way of thinking about it but you'll see in a minute when we pick up and you'll see this morning's message come right into view because you couldn't start with Adam as being a baby he was God's first creation if you want to call him he was God's first son come on you want to quote let everyone said Adam was God's first son he said Jesus was his begotten the Adam even though he had eternal life he was not God but Jesus was now so get the point he would have to give this creation the choice of free more agency and not make a way that Eve would fall he made her perfect he made her the most beautiful of all but he knew by making her she would be the one that would cause Adam to fall that's no problem is it sisters that's not degrading you you know why because on the other hand you're a top of the bride of Christ which is the most beautiful woman in the Bible so don't think I'm throwing off on you it's just the truth of what happened if Eve had not have been in Adam you could change things around but Eve was in Adam but when she was taken from Adam is when the possibility of the Fall came into being now but you think about it God knew we would fall now let's don't get on the wrong thing that's what I'm trying to say it huh we think well he made that woman over there but that's what he made the fall right there no he didn't make her that away you got it all messed up he can't make her that away he's God he can't make something wrong but yet he knows that's the only way that it could come into being that he would be a redeemer A Healer and if we were there in a part of him like we were talking about this morning then we ought to know ourselves that there was no other way he could do it he couldn't make anything wrong and be God but he knows that if he made us now that's a strong statement that sounds like he's predestinating us that's the reason I'm trying to get this out of the way before we get to Genesis 1. if I just preached this evening on this I'd be all right we'll get Genesis one Wednesday how would it be that God would know we would fall but not predestinators to fall there's a difference in you because predestinating with me determining it he would be making you fall that's the point I'm trying to get across this afternoon God never made us to fall he made us perfect but he knew we would and I like to put it this way don't run out there now and say I'm saved it don't matter what I do I wouldn't want a child like that would you but you see for him to know what we would do is different from him making us do it take the Holy Ghost away from you right now or me either one we're nothing but an animal oh no I would do it that's where you're in a trap of the devil you'd be like the lady was that right around spoke of you know that used to dance and think oh I used to do that but I don't want to do it but I'll just sit down and listen here a little bit you know and I'll just stay right here and I'll listen a little bit well you know I can witness to them about Jesus you know what first thing you know she's in a man's arms I didn't go and see because I didn't care but you heard a lot of stories about the lady that used to do striptease Acts and then she went and sat down and talked to everybody about the Lord now what are you being saved from you know but you get the point so think with the idea of what I'm trying to say by giving us a choice he knew we'd take the wrong choice but now listen the part of God that we spoke of this morning never made the wrong choice okay the part of God we were talking about this morning the sons of God shouting for joy you can't make that make a wrong choice but if you can put that in flesh and let flesh go through a lot of problems like I said you take the Holy Ghost out right now and we'd be killing each other in an hour right amen no no brother I'm just making that a point it might be true right now see God knew we would fall they couldn't make us fall but he knew we would but he knew also that if he didn't bring us into being no matter what he knew we would do he knew that he would never be a savior right so come on he knew that he had to permit us to come into being so take on this now let's get a little bit of let's just read about these things look look at number four brother let's go to that one because that's all I want to get in your mind maybe this today we'll go come back to number three excuse me which is taken from water baptism preached 1961 1119 E36 and as God in the beginning knowed that man would fall therefore he could put him on free more agency knowing because he would display his attributes to be father he knew it fall but that was the only way he could be father to be son to be healer to be a savior how could he save that something's lost and then God was the attributes before there even was an angel or a molecule or anything God was by himself alone but he wasn't God because God is an object of worship there was nothing to worship nothing to worship him but his attributes his attributes displayed something and made an angel then he was God then he made a man give him three more agency he's just playing it the angels how would they be an attribute because he created them hold your point they were not attributes as the attributes of God they were only the thoughts of God Judas was a thought of God right are you with me but he was not an attribute of God come on he was the thought of God the Angels were thoughts because they're not redeemable those one-third that fell after Satan's lie can never be redeemed angels are not human beings they're an attribute because they made him a creator because he created the angels but like I said you show me now in the Bible the message where he created me and you oh now I know he created us in His image and I know that so we're going to get down to that later but I'm just making a point what did he say now he also knowed that there had to be a lost people and to save people at the same time he knew that we would fall he knew he would redeem us but he knew some people would never be redeemed right okay going back to his infinite all right going down now to number four this is uh Revelations chapter 5 61 6 18. God knowing that man would fall yet he could not make man fall God knowing man would be lost though he did not want anybody lost but to order that he the great display of the attributes of God might be manifested to all men that he could be a redeemer he could be a savior man had to fall it was in him to fall right then it was in God to redeem him again that's the we have to have not time to display you say well he had to fall it was in him to fall see once he put us into the world he knew what was going to do right not being carnal in our wrong saying but he made Adam and Eve the way he knew he he didn't make them with parts shy and then made them with other parts to make the fall right not being too wrong on it saying it he made him go they knew what it's going to do right well why didn't he just keep them from doing it because he could have never been a savior right so his attributes required something to be lost so he could display that one then he would have to make man in the right condition if you move in any form from that right condition of making man you're going to make him one way or the other you'll be wrong he said well why didn't he just sleep well he could have left Adam by himself he could have done that but now remember it was in him to fall now you know that I preached a little bit different most preachers who you just got to put up with it we blame Eve as I said while ago for the whole thing that byproduct you gave me can I quote a quote and then seemingly tear it apart original creation can't fall but Adam did you going to argue with me you can't argue the point right so it was in Adam it wasn't something wrong with Adam it wasn't something wrong with Eve see you're making them do something and that's not in God you can argue how children would have been born had there been no fall you got a hypothetical point to talk about and it's totally hypothetical because it didn't happen right so it never was going to happen but you we say Eve then well Eve was it Eve had the ability to fall Adam followed her amen so Brothers don't run down to the nearest Honky Tonk to talk to the naked women about the Lord is that blunt enough amen right why because you're a man Adam was a man the reason the prophet would say it that the original creation can't fall is because there was no ability for Satan to be able to get into his mind well brother Lee Vale used to preach you know life about it and how much I know I don't know where it's true or not I remember that but he had a he had a male Serpent and a female serpent and some of you may have heard that and he had that old male serpent dancing around Eve and he had that female dancing around Adam was the adamant now no perversion he wasn't exercising free more agency and his flues had not been stopped up do you understand what happened to Eve Satan began to reason in her mind until he brought her into a condition but you know what after Eve done what she done some way she got Adam to do what he done and there was two kids born one from the Beast and one from Adam you got no argument that's why I'm blunt because you don't argue points then well it could have been no it couldn't have been because that's what took place Adam was there in a position or condition he could not be tempted let's put it this way Jesus was in that condition you agree with that he could be tempted but not sin Adam was a human you might could talk about him ability to be tempted by a female serpent or whatever you don't do but he wouldn't sin because his flus was not stopped up see Satan knew exactly how to get to Eve it wasn't Eve was made so uh you know until she just grabbed the Beast no he slowly planted within her mind you fathers you see them boys hanging around them girls you watch them they start acting different no boys making an inroad trying to be a pastor without being vulgar listen trying to preach Redemption we're trying to find out what the fall was because when we get over to Adam we're going to have Adam and Eve in the garden with no ability to fall you see where we're going next because Adam and Eve and theophany couldn't fall okie dokie you see where we're going just want to get this point though the word that we don't think about but I can't fall I'm a born-again Christian you're still living in a human body you can still think still think wrong and do think wrong no my thoughts are all pure well pray for me maybe the devil ain't got after you yet we're all human you know what I mean what is it I walk up and I say brother Carly once Wade got against you ah forget it I didn't mean nothing by that you're gonna go and worry about what it is right that'd be the deceiving part right we're all human right nobody run you off the road you don't say praise the Lord Do It Again after a while you learn to say okay peace just don't do it the second time we're human right so what did he say God knowing that man would fall yet he could not make man fall knowing that man would be lost we did not want anybody lost me all right but in order to be that great display of the attributes of God let me manifested to all men it could be a redeemer it could be a savior it could be a Healer okay go to the next one look what he starts off on Christ and Mr God reveal paragraph 184 predestinated there's the mystery all involved in it he before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride he said when you said this morning he didn't choose us he also preached two sermons on how you were chosen now anybody care to answer how we were chosen in him okay so he's not contrary right that he chose to brought what knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall when he would choose a bride that would not fall a hold of that word why because now we have the song to sing I'm redeemed my love divine we got it right now we got to plan a Redemption go on to the next I just want to get a couple of these he could not be just and make a man to fall he had to put him on equal basis a free moral agency don't choice but knowing he would follow Nikki he can't be a savior unless there's something lost he can't be a healing this or something sick these things had to be that way God made them to us so that his great attributes could be displayed if there wasn't that he he'd never he'd have never been a savior but we know he was and he is so what has it been there had to be something lost how is it going to be if he takes and loses it just in order to save it then it isn't Justice on his judgment he couldn't send a man to hell and be just he's kind gentle true honestly great judge he'd be working against himself so we had to put a man out there and make him on three more agency so he he would knowing would fall and the man in his own image stopped how could he fall you see daylight you see in daylight in other words your eyes opening so we had to make a byproduct something out of the original creation what happened knowing it was fault it was put over into the hands of Satan for a vessel Of Dishonor all right now three more agency knowing it would fall what's that and the man in his own image how could he fall hold your point this ain't the man he's talking about this ain't the image of God this is an image of animal you still want to get this out of the way and where we can float through when we get into the creation of man or the bringing of man forth we get you to think see we're thinking and the man in his own image could not fall us men couldn't fall he's just the more women it fell we've made an image of God now wait just a cotton picking minute what was the image he was made in oh well I got a quote she was made in the image of man thank goodness you read so what was the image of Adam I'm trying to get you to think this is not the image of God Adam's standing there in flesh was not the image of God the Inside Man couldn't follow didn't say the outside man couldn't okay does that click contrary to your thinking so we got a lot more contrary clickings to happen I guess and right around him said in a man in original creation couldn't fall but you didn't think that Adam couldn't fall was that what you thought that was what I thought Adam in the image of God can't fall right Adam and animal image did fall all right you see we're talking about God and his children and we're trying not to make us so big and whatever we are let him make us what we are it is he that has made us not we ourselves right so think about it knowing that it would fall man and his image couldn't fall and it looks it's exactly like he said but he made the woman and she fell Adam did fall but the inside of him never failed the one that was created in the image of God did not fall the one that was created an image of animal fail as I said Adam was made but yet he was not seduced in his mind his mind had not been perverted so it was displayed from his inward body out into the outward part of him he finally got to him Satan got to Eve uh what is it right around on is it Blasphemous name where he said Satan stopped up her flus you know he got into her spirit realm reasoning memory conscious affections Etc well don't you think that it eventually got into Adam's memory reason conscious affection because he had a child by Eve all right it had to be within 24 hours so no right okay free more agency going to the next one God's gifts always find her places 63 12 22. he had to make him in his image make him something like him all right now we'll get to that later so what was made something like God inward part all right and put him who the man is being on three more agents he didn't let him act any way he wanted to he could take his choice and he knew that man by giving him this choice would fall so being that he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him we'll get to that eventually I hope so and does nothing except he does it through a man right you're listening to somebody preach he's turning back around using it right are you listening look at the next one thy house we'll just get this part we'll we won't get into the creation it makes you die house 1961-808 e66. he come down making man and all the animals till he come down to sin but he could not make sin because he cannot be righteous and the father of righteousness to make sin so you know what he done he made abandoned his own image okay and knowing that he would fall put him on a basis of free moral agency now the inside of Adam never fail the soul of Adam the eternal life couldn't fall I know I know people oh you we're just a triple part we just Body Spirit and soul why does everybody want to divide it how many sermons have I preached to you in the past even a year about do you sin with your body or do you sin with your spirit or your sin with your soul God if you sin with your soul you're lost you remember that so your body and spirit can still do wrong okay he'd put him on a basis three more ages he said now don't touch your street he knew he was going to touch it but he couldn't him to touch it because he said touch this tree and you live and touch this tree and you die any new man would fail but yet he couldn't make him fall he had to do it on he had to do it on himself so what makes God righteous you see man fell himself after he made him so close to himself he put him on the basis of three more agency and therefore there is where he fell by his own free moral agent act he failed all right free moral agent made it to where he'd fall let's go one more then we'll just preach a second and quit one more does God change his mind 64 427. you're talking about his attributes on a display now to be a savior that has to be something lost and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and his great judgment would he put man on three more agency knowing that man would fall and in that then he became man himself in order to redeem Batman that fell that's the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel if God sent down another person besides himself then that wouldn't be just God had to come himself and take and take place and God could not be come down in spirit and take place he had to be made flesh In the Flesh of his own creative son and he show he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create Man Out of the Dust of the Earth but you see he permitted sick to be brought in perfect will it was to be created physically out of the flesh let me close or speak just a minute make sure you understand me as we'll cover winds through the inside of Adam could not fall because it was in the image of God but the outside of Adam this flesh man he knew if he put us in flesh we'd fall don't think just because you're a Christian that that flesh don't control you right don't think that spirit inside of you don't control you we're not trying to talk about something like that or sinless perfection we're talking about a man in the garden that would be created and made the perfect way could not make him wrong and judge him for being wrong you made him perfect he made that inside part of him to be eternal but the outside of him was a mortal flesh Eve that devil went straight to her spirit being he had to pervert her mind first that's the way sin enters the picture it has to enter through our mind he could not make us wrong and judge us for being wrong so he had to make us right that's what I wanted to get this out of the way I thought I'd get into the other part but we'll just leave it on that he knew if he created us we'd go wrong yeah but brother Dale you don't you don't understand I thought she was talking about this morning how eternal that part of God is that's right that part of God can't fall if you're born again Christian you can't sin enough to be lost but if you're born again Christian why would you want to be lost or why would you want to sin if you'd like to Prophet explaining he said if I go overseas he said my wife and I he said if I went over and said I told her some woman run up to me he said I believe she'd forgive me right but he said how would I do that knowing that she was at home taking care of the kids and all she's done God knew we would fall now I'm going to make it blunt all right we blame Adam and Eve right if they had done what would they done we wouldn't be what we do oh I'll do it this way so um not anybody here by the name so we'll use it so we made uh Jim Jones Jim Jones is the first man we'll get off of that and listen to what I'm talking about we're trying to be such a smart alec if Jim Jones was the first man he'd fall because the first man did fall but the first man never fell in his inner being he fell in his physical being so God knew if he put us in a physical being right the physical being would override the spiritual being now you tell me it don't now I'm going to tell you to pray for me because you know sometimes I get hungry and I want something to eat when I need to go read and study but you know what I wind up going to get something to eat right you know that a lot of times when I come in from work and I need a bath instead of praying and studying I'm going to take a bath maybe not for myself but for everybody else around me my point when God made the flesh man he made the ability to go wrong he didn't make it wrong I've tried to say that over and over 40 years I've said that when he made the flesh he made the ability as long as he was in Adam there was no way Satan could get to her but once she was removed from him and put it in her own body brought about the ability because the human body is the problem now come on I know the scriptures I know the prophets all right so don't Judy chatter around with me the body without your spirit is dead I know that so I'm dealing with that second realm at the same time I'm dealing with outside so God when he made man he made him see tastes feel smelling here that would be dealing with life in their doings but he also made the inward part of man memory reason conscious affections Etc so what's our problem today Spirit Realm and Flash realm flesh is displaying what our spirit does wrong you know things so we even her spirit went wrong he got to the only place he could not walk up to Eve and do the wrong Act come on that wouldn't have been wrong I believe a girl goes out and the boy rapes her that that's not her problem she's still a virgin I know you don't like my talk but plain language you argue with me about it then she's raped she's still a virgin not still restoring any virginity just telling it like it is it wasn't her fault in the Bible he don't kill her you kill him but you see we were made then just mortal beings subject to these life given a spirit that is not eternal amen thereby Satan could get to Eve come on but you know what he finally done where do you want to say Adam was a type in Christ or whatever you want to try to make it steel Adam done wrong because he was Immortal Eve was able to do what Satan was not able to do he was able to enter the spirit realm of Adam you know what I mean she was able to attempt Adam and tell Adam I'm all about it didn't she tell him didn't she give him the fruit didn't she tell him about it well so now when we get into creating the Kingdom in God's image just remember that the man in God's image can't fall but the man in the image of animal he is in a fallen condition the best you can do with the old bodies that we look at you know they're gone they got to be redeemed my soul is not redeemed I mean my soul is redeemed but my body is not redeemed page 49 the future home waiting the Redemption of the body don't dilly dally around with these old flesh they can get you in trouble oh that don't bother me yeah you're right in the middle of all of it I told you about it I never did drink in my life never did care nothing about it I never didn't use vulgar I mean you know we were kids we used to but I'm you know what I'm talking about I never just used a lot of vulgarity and you know after becoming a Christian you know one day I was around somebody that was was drinking nothing I wonder what that tastes like I thought well what in the world am I wondering what it would taste like I didn't even want it when it was a center well you know I could have kept on what did it taste like I wonder what it tastes like sort of look good knowing you know what I would have done I'd went and bought one oh no I wouldn't do that the only reason you wouldn't do it is because you're afraid you get caught going into the liquor store huh be like I was going in one day looking for some rock you know some some whiskey to make cough syrup because the doctor told us that there ain't nothing you can do for the kids just get you some whisk ain't no whiskey and some rock candy when I told her I didn't know that beer and wine store didn't sell whiskey I go in this beer and wine store I'm looking for some whiskey we don't sell whiskey I wonder what he was going after you know because he turned around to go get it he said we don't sell whiskey I said okay would you mind telling me where I can get some he said you got to find a hard liquor store to buy I didn't know and see I never would cussing or nothing but then I'll be talking to somebody by that time something you know you have to keep from saying it he said oh well brother Dale I'm not messed up like I'm glad you ain't messed up like me I just tell that you don't I'm honest so you didn't have to say God forgive me for even letting a thought enter my mind that wouldn't even enter my mind when I was a sinner why because brother Reynolds said you put on that code of a Christian he said the devil will turn every gun he's got on you he said because he's going to make you prove what you are well you know what we're here for we're here to prove he's wrong that he can't get us let's stand let's talk think on it these bodies these things that we're living in they're subject to the Fallen condition with the soul within us by the new birth is eternal don't give us a right to go out and do wrong no it shows when we do wrong we're going to automatically repent in a hurry why because we we're the children of God I want to make sure you understand that before we start a condition because why would you need Redemption if you didn't have a fallen condition and what was the Fallen condition not God making us wrong he made us perfect but Satan knew how to pervert what he made and to be able to contact us that way I don't blame Adam and Eve right do you what do we got number 87 anybody have a need just think on it God knew we'd go wrong understanding every day with blood as I walk with the heaven leader let me go on the white with a shot feel my way anybody have a knee just think about it he knew it'd fall but he knew what he's gonna do he would go to college staff the Salvation not made on anything but an eternal God he knew what he was going to do he don't thank us for going wrong no God he didn't make us wrong but by Falling we could God could bring forth his attributes if we realize there is a God to take care of all things see as the king all the way every day every day with love think about him he didn't go somewhere else and wait on us he come down he's gonna make sure everything goes right gonna make sure that everything goes the way he wants it Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord right praise the Lord let all God's people praise the Lord shake them off Heavy band praise the Lord called wine because we're just his offspring right so let's end it up with ain't God good brother that'll it'll go right good give us what we are yeah we have to thank him a little more today ain't God good you believe it to redeem us to make a way give us a choice see three more agency not only to make a wrong choice three more agencies when you can make the right choice I'm a new creation or what are we we are the father we are joining thank you
