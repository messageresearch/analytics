[18:53] [Music]
[18:56] are gathering in

[19:54] that's your feast
[19:56] that's what God's prepared for you
[19:57] before the foundation of the world
[20:01] the angels all will listen
[20:04] they can't sing about Redemption
[20:06] they've never been redeemed and they've
[20:08] been lost
[20:10] so they're gonna have to be what
[20:12] silent
[20:15] a moment of silence
[20:17] because they can't understand why we're
[20:20] shouting
[20:21] they can't understand why we're
[20:23] glorifying God
[20:25] they can't understand why we say Lord if
[20:27] you happen to come
[20:31] we wouldn't have been here
[20:33] they were just Angels they were created
[20:34] to worship
[20:36] some of them he created to make a choice
[20:38] some of them he created I don't think he
[20:39] made a choice I think they they all went
[20:41] with one it went with the other and and
[20:44] then
[20:46] you and I
[20:48] are the whole reason that they were made
[20:51] Angels were made to take care of the
[20:54] redeemed of the Earth
[20:55] amen to do the things of the Lord do the
[20:58] to show and lead and guide us and always
[21:02] said
[21:03] uh and I know some of you same way here
[21:06] my poor Guardian Angel bless his heart
[21:09] he's going to look like a ragged a
[21:11] ragged youngin when I when I get over
[21:13] there brother John he's going to look
[21:14] pretty rough because he's had to stop me
[21:16] from doing a lot of dumb stuff
[21:18] and he's allowed me to do a few dumb
[21:20] stuff when God goes let him do that just
[21:23] go ahead and let he's going to learn
[21:25] something from this okay just go ahead
[21:26] and let him do that and the Angel's

[24:54] in-laws so we're going to put them up
[24:56] somewhere
[24:57] I don't want them to stay in a motel

[25:00] to get here so I think we ought to put
[25:02] them up somewhere if anybody's got a
[25:04] place for them to stay I sure would
[25:06] appreciate if you'd move the dirty
[25:08] clothes out of the way and oh I'm sorry
[25:10] never mind move the dirty clothes out of
[25:12] the way and let them sleep in the bed
[25:14] y'all throw your dirty clothes on even
[25:16] clean clothes whatever we've done it for
[25:18] Regina so let's go Son of Man part 77.

[27:05] Aaron said so well Wednesday night this
[27:07] church is built on the truth
[27:11] from the Holy Ghost it's not been a man

[27:15] straight
[27:16] and we appreciate brother Dale and what
[27:18] he's done absolutely we could not have
[27:22] what we have

[27:26] for paying for all these things that he
[27:28] pays for uh the children listen a lot of

[28:52] they've lost a piece of their self
[28:55] right sister and you know you was
[28:57] talking about that the other day you've
[28:58] lost a piece of yourself you can't live
[29:00] intimately with somebody for 20 or 30 40
[29:02] 50 60 years and not just lose a whole
[29:04] piece of your life
[29:06] so I I don't want to fill that like I'll
[29:09] filled it but I want to make sure
[29:11] that she's happier she can be and that
[29:13] she has what she needs and if I ever
[29:14] find out any of you sisters are having a
[29:16] hard time and don't tell somebody about
[29:18] it you're gonna have a problem with me
[29:21] because we can help you in this church
[29:22] everything can be we can we can help our
[29:25] young sisters we can young at heart but
[29:29] uh I think we're we're ordained to do
[29:32] that to take care of our own people
[29:34] first and then as we take care of our
[29:36] own people then I think God will take
[29:39] care of us and bless us
[29:41] it's just a big circle he'll turn around
[29:42] and bless us back the other way always
[29:44] has always will never seen us out give
[29:46] God never but we try to give as much as
[29:49] we can so we appreciate our our sisters
[29:52] that that are widows and don't have
[29:54] husbands here because like I said it's
[29:57] hard enough
[29:59] with two
[30:00] much less now one and you've lost one
[30:02] Partners we really want to uh
[30:05] you know not hug them physically but you
[30:07] know hug them up by the word of God and
[30:09] make sure that y'all have what you need
[30:10] to have and uh
[30:13] yeah we're family we're that's right
[30:14] we're family you lose we lose
[30:16] you lose we lose you gain we gain all
[30:19] right so I just wanted to make sure that
[30:21] we understand that being Christmas time
[30:22] here that we make sure that um that we
[30:24] have everything we need all right not
[30:27] our watch but our needs all right God
[30:29] will fulfill your needs your wants
[30:31] you're going to probably have to work
[30:32] overtime to get your wants but uh it has
[30:35] a job but to get your needs God said
[30:37] he'd provide your needs amen so let's
[30:40] buy our heads Lord thank you for this
[30:42] day that you give us
[30:43] Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[30:46] as the prophet said one time we're just
[30:48] humans off of a off of a human tree and
[30:53] we've all come under the curse of sin
[30:56] born wrong
[30:58] Lord without a chance to you come
[31:02] but you said you would come
[31:04] and you would redeem us back to what we
[31:06] were before the fall
[31:08] and father we pray now that this journey
[31:10] that we're on that you'll take us back
[31:12] through this journey Lord and it will
[31:14] see today in the days forward that you

[31:20] all the seven compound names Plus
[31:23] that you'll provide our needs Lord and
[31:25] you'll just be with us and hug us up
[31:27] when we need to be hugged Lord you'll be
[31:29] our comfort in a time of trouble you'll
[31:31] be our partner when there's not one
[31:33] there beside of us you'll be our
[31:35] strength when we're weak you'll be our
[31:37] song when we can't sing anymore you'll
[31:40] be our comfort when we are not comforted
[31:42] by the world
[31:43] father I pray that you just be with us
[31:45] now be with us now more
[31:47] intimately than you ever have before
[31:49] Lord we invite you into our homes we
[31:51] invite you into this church we invite
[31:53] you into ourself
[31:55] we invite you Lord into this realm that
[31:57] we're talking about of spirit with
[31:59] memory reason conscious affection
[32:00] imagination
[32:01] Lord you said you love to be invited as
[32:04] you stood in the door and knocked and we
[32:06] know that the doorknob is on the inside
[32:08] so Lord may we today let you in and let
[32:11] you commune and sup with us Lord we love

[32:28] them Supernatural strength Lord and help
[32:30] them through life just Lord may we
[32:32] always remember this is not just a
[32:33] season of giving
[32:34] it is to the world but you're a giver
[32:36] every day of the week every hour of the
[32:38] day every month of the year and every
[32:41] year that we live You're The Giver Lord
[32:43] and we give you all the praise and honor
[32:45] and glory for that in Jesus name
[32:47] amen
[32:48] part 77 in the beginning was the word
[32:50] where it was with God and the Word was
[32:51] God and the Word was made flesh and
[32:53] dwelt among us and we behold his glory
[32:55] the glory of the only begotten of the
[32:57] father
[32:57] full of grace and truth Luke 6 verse 19
[33:00] says the whole multitude sought to touch
[33:02] him for there went virtue out of him and
[33:04] healed them all we're going to get to
[33:05] this right here proverbs 31 10 who can
[33:09] find a virtuous woman
[33:11] for her price is far
[33:14] above rubies
[33:16] you may be seeing the Lord as blessing
[33:18] to the reading of the word
[33:19] her price is far above rubies
[33:24] priceless
[33:26] is this virtue that you have being the
[33:28] Bride of Jesus Christ but we didn't
[33:30] start out that way we started out lost
[33:33] we started out in needing God we started
[33:35] out needing a savior somebody to save
[33:37] our soul
[33:38] all right but when there's a journey
[33:41] somewhere that we've got to come to you
[33:43] and I the world has a journey and their
[33:46] journey is going to lead them to hell if
[33:48] they don't get born again come on
[33:49] somebody that's going to lead them to
[33:52] Hell their leader is going to take them
[33:54] someplace but our leader is going to
[33:55] take us to another place amen thank God
[33:59] we're on the winning side thank God
[34:00] we're gonna read here in just a few
[34:02] minutes that he that overcometh
[34:05] he that conquers
[34:07] what Jesus conquered death handling the
[34:09] grave of course he out today he's inside
[34:10] of you so you conquered death hell and
[34:12] the grave all right if you'll just
[34:14] believe that let out that what's inside
[34:16] of you brother Brian said that atomic
[34:18] bomb of faith
[34:21] you've got that inside of you brother
[34:23] Brown said if you're born again he said
[34:24] you got enough power in you to create a
[34:27] world
[34:28] and go live on it
[34:30] wow
[34:31] right now
[34:33] not just I mean a baby Christian
[34:36] has got power with God
[34:38] nobody with me but then God had to send
[34:41] us a messenger we know that a Malachi 4
[34:43] he sent us a messenger to come and to
[34:45] deliver us the truth
[34:47] not a truth the truth there's been a
[34:51] truth down through time but these great
[34:53] mystery truths as he's talking about
[34:55] Malachi 4
[34:56] you know Malachi 3 is kind of a lot of
[34:59] Destruction going on and and different
[35:01] things but and then you know it'll Smite
[35:03] the Earth with a curse you hear all
[35:05] these cursings in the Bible and God's
[35:08] going to give you that if you don't
[35:09] accept him like I said before if you're
[35:11] not covered by him then you're covered
[35:13] by the other guy and the other guy he's
[35:14] going to lose
[35:15] okay so that's the choice that you and I
[35:18] have to make but now we're called into
[35:20] the end time as we were talking about
[35:21] this morning in the end time we're
[35:23] called for the culmination of everything
[35:25] there's not any Loose Ends brother I'm
[35:27] coming to get all the loose ends tied
[35:28] back together to bring that faith of the
[35:31] fathers back to us listen so we can have
[35:34] faith in something
[35:35] the Catholic church has faith in their
[35:37] Pope
[35:38] the Baptists have faith in their
[35:40] leadership
[35:41] the methodists have their leadership and
[35:44] and I hope that they're you know you you
[35:46] got to put your heart somewhere
[35:49] so if you put your heart in Jesus Christ
[35:51] he will lead you to this message and
[35:53] then what will happen this message it'll
[35:54] help you grow up
[35:56] it'll help you to where God can use you
[35:59] where he won't use the world he's going
[36:01] to use me and you to destroy the effects
[36:04] of the devil remember the devil will not
[36:06] be destroyed until after the Thousand
[36:09] Years so we're not going to try to
[36:10] destroy him we're just going to try to
[36:12] keep him out of us
[36:14] all right because we can't destroy the
[36:16] Devil we can destroy the effects of the
[36:18] devil and by with me there's a
[36:20] difference there because the devil's
[36:22] still going to be according to the Bible
[36:23] he's going to be alive for a thousand
[36:25] years while we're on the earth in
[36:27] glorified bodies then he's going to try
[36:29] to gather a bunch of people together and
[36:31] with us and he can't do it
[36:34] we're unwiffable
[36:36] for those of you that are not from the
[36:37] south that means invincible we're
[36:40] unwiffable look that up in the Bob in
[36:42] the dictionary I don't think Webster
[36:45] ever even got to that but these mystery
[36:47] truths that literally turn us back is
[36:48] what we're talking about now we're going
[36:50] to go up the statue of perfect man we're
[36:52] going our mindset is going to be we need
[36:54] virtue but we don't need to be a virgin
[36:56] now don't get me wrong you do need to be
[36:58] let's don't go over into greasy Grace
[37:00] and you do whatever you want to no no
[37:02] but to be a virgin to Jesus Christ is
[37:06] the greatest thing you'll ever be
[37:09] hey man not a physical virgin everybody
[37:12] with me don't be a little plain but I
[37:14] guess I'll have to be
[37:15] because if you put everything on being a
[37:18] virgin then there's a lot of people
[37:19] ain't gonna make it
[37:21] all right
[37:23] if that's all solely you put it on but
[37:25] if you put it that God Makes You The
[37:28] Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[37:30] he does it by his blood see the Catholic
[37:33] Church sister Anna's not too far off
[37:36] see they get a little truth they'll get
[37:38] a little anointing and they'll say okay
[37:41] we have power to turn you back to a
[37:43] virgin
[37:44] well that's you can't do that physically
[37:47] all right brother Brown said she can be
[37:50] forgiven but not justified in other
[37:51] words you can't walk up and say I'm a
[37:53] virgin and had three or four guys you
[37:54] are vice versa we always say that uh
[37:57] vice versa the man needs to be one too
[38:00] come on somebody
[38:05] but he said sanctify them who through
[38:07] what though how can we be Sanctified the
[38:09] Catholic churches we can what we can
[38:11] turn you around throw salt over your
[38:13] shoulder say okay your version you can
[38:14] marry well see that's not so far off if
[38:17] you'll take it in the spiritual sense
[38:19] that God has made us that are just
[38:21] outcasts of the world we're the
[38:23] of the world come on somebody we're the
[38:25] rahabs we're the we're the woman at the
[38:27] well right hey man
[38:30] but God has done something for us he by
[38:32] his what by his transforming power he
[38:35] sees us as a virgin
[38:37] I'm gonna read you the quote where
[38:39] brother Brian said that virtuous sinless
[38:41] bride of Jesus Christ if you are in
[38:44] Revelations 19 and we're going to read
[38:45] it maybe in just a few minutes if we get
[38:47] to it Revelations 19 says it is the
[38:50] righteousness of the Saints is what you
[38:52] got on
[38:54] not the righteousness of God
[38:57] the righteousness of the Saints
[39:00] when you come to be a wife
[39:03] you have come to a position
[39:06] bride you know Lily and Zach they're
[39:08] just I mean you know this Roman candles
[39:11] every 10 seconds and it's just oh it's
[39:14] just oh this is so great
[39:18] I hope the Lord don't tear another 10
[39:20] years but give them 10 years
[39:23] you always say the honeymoon's over when
[39:25] that camp it don't have to be
[39:27] but there are things you got to deal
[39:29] with because what's going to happen is
[39:30] you you have never and Lily and I were
[39:32] talking about today there's things that
[39:33] happen that's never happened before and
[39:36] you got to get used to that
[39:39] you said well no you put two people
[39:41] together that's never been together
[39:43] before
[39:44] yeah yeah
[39:45] you're gonna go why didn't you tell me
[39:47] this before we got married
[39:51] Lily said hey man
[39:56] you need to watch that cast so son you
[39:58] need to wash your cast you'll cast
[40:00] stinks your wife told you to do that
[40:02] she's your wife now she's your bride
[40:06] use you some Epsom salts or something do
[40:09] I put something on it sanctify them
[40:10] through that truth the word is what's
[40:12] going to sanctify so it's not anything
[40:13] that we can't be we can't be washed by
[40:16] regular water
[40:18] it's got to be the water of the word and
[40:20] that's the only thing that's going to
[40:21] what wash all that away from us all
[40:23] right sanctify them through thy truth
[40:26] Thy word is truth and that's what I
[40:29] believe we're standing in the truth so
[40:32] as we're standing in the truth we can be
[40:33] washed White
[40:35] oh I had forget that
[40:39] oh I did see there you are in your
[40:40] memories and contradiction imagination
[40:43] go to the soul and listen to what your
[40:45] soul says if your soul is born again it
[40:48] says hey you didn't do that
[40:51] I'll read it here in just a minute
[40:52] brother Brown says you didn't do it in
[40:54] the first place what the real you didn't
[40:56] do it this is not the real you
[40:59] this is permitted by God to keep
[41:02] everything together for you to live a
[41:04] human life to do what to be redeemed
[41:07] but it's not going to redeem this one
[41:09] first it redeems your soul first
[41:11] excuse me then through your body
[41:13] remember reading contribution
[41:14] imagination and then this thing's just
[41:16] in for the ride
[41:18] this thing just here for the ride okay
[41:21] some of us as we get older we get rolled
[41:23] a little bit harder
[41:25] but look as thou has sent me into the
[41:27] world even so I censor what what we were
[41:29] saying the other day Jesus didn't say
[41:30] well now I'm going to protect you and
[41:31] I'm going to keep you in a cave
[41:33] no I'm gonna present you to the world
[41:35] I'm gonna put you in the world
[41:38] and I'm a pro of to the devil that you
[41:41] can live in this world what the worst
[41:43] world the worst time it's ever been is
[41:45] right now
[41:47] the things that you have to put up with
[41:49] I have to put up with oh my word
[41:52] think about it 50 60 years ago no
[41:56] internet no cell phone
[41:58] no computers in the house you got your
[42:01] information from the newspaper
[42:04] our word of mouth or maybe the
[42:05] television but now it's instant you get
[42:08] whatever you want on your phone
[42:10] well guess what you get the good and the
[42:12] bad
[42:14] amen
[42:15] yeah you get a lot if you don't want
[42:17] but you know why because we're we've
[42:19] entered into that fourth dimension that
[42:21] fourth dimension is just wide open now
[42:24] and it's just going through this
[42:25] building a million times more than even
[42:27] when the prophet stood in 1963 and he
[42:30] said there's people going through this
[42:31] building
[42:33] voices going through this building he
[42:35] said we can pick the voices up right
[42:36] here we'll put a recorder out
[42:38] or we'll put her turn the television on
[42:40] well same here but oh my talking about
[42:42] internet talk about websites talk about
[42:43] Wi-Fi we're talking about the other day
[42:45] or today and everything your watch has
[42:48] got Wi-Fi on it your car's got Wi-Fi we
[42:50] got Wi-Fi everywhere
[42:54] and it's bombarding your brain
[42:56] subconsciously and you don't even know
[42:58] it that's why that we have to be the
[43:01] most protected people in the world
[43:02] because and God knew that try brother
[43:04] around said you're astronauts now you're
[43:06] not just airplane drivers you're not
[43:09] just one of them little old we call them
[43:10] hang gliders
[43:11] no you're made to get in a spaceship
[43:14] you're made to be as he said pressurized
[43:17] for this time
[43:19] so listen you say oh I can't stand it
[43:21] yes you can
[43:23] Provisions have been made for you to
[43:25] make it don't think God is going to put
[43:27] you in this age and go oh I shouldn't
[43:29] have done that no he knew exactly he
[43:31] gave you all the provisions you needed
[43:33] he gave you a pastor to preach for you
[43:35] for to you for years a five-fold
[43:37] Ministry that we bring in tapes to
[43:39] listen to people to to sit around and
[43:42] discuss hey I got this issue young
[43:43] people when I was growing up folks there
[43:45] was no such thing as a youth camp
[43:49] no there was no such thing as a youth
[43:51] camp they started those only maybe 10 or
[43:52] 15 maybe 20 something years ago and and
[43:55] and thank God
[43:56] that it was able to give you us a little
[43:58] bit of a chance but when I was growing
[44:00] up it was just you know
[44:02] make it or don't make it listen or don't
[44:04] listen
[44:05] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[44:07] this is Jesus Christ that they also
[44:09] might be Sanctified through the truth
[44:11] and then we're talking about now the
[44:13] inside guy the spirit realm memory
[44:16] reason conscious faction imagination
[44:17] that's where listen if you're born again
[44:20] today you have virtue inside of you
[44:23] now to let it out it's a different story
[44:27] to let it out through those Outlets of
[44:29] memory reason conscious affection
[44:31] imagination that's where it gets tricky
[44:33] because Satan can do as we were talking
[44:35] about and we're going to read it later
[44:36] on where he comes in with his white
[44:39] horse rider he comes in with his oh it's
[44:41] okay
[44:43] just go to church
[44:46] that's false
[44:48] it was so real though and so pretty
[44:51] until two people was deceived by it
[44:54] John admired it brother Brown said if
[44:57] that if that angel hadn't got his
[44:59] attention away from it
[45:01] he was admiring that church it was so
[45:04] beautiful
[45:05] I admired it John said in other words
[45:07] I'm I'm I'm just I'm just oh I'm I'm
[45:10] just am overwhelmed
[45:14] that this has got this is the devil
[45:17] the angel said yeah
[45:19] you need to get away from that John come
[45:21] out of her my people and then also
[45:24] brother Bradham preached the mighty
[45:25] conqueror was Revelation 6 which it was
[45:29] not we know that
[45:30] but he progressed in Revelation just
[45:32] like me and you there's a lot of false
[45:33] Doctrine we thought that was right hello
[45:36] that we don't think right anymore why
[45:38] the Holy Ghost Our God tells us what's
[45:41] true and what's not
[45:43] so the memories of contradiction
[45:44] imagination is bombarded by Satan it's
[45:46] bombarded by God what did the old Indian
[45:49] chief say he said Chief which one wins
[45:52] he said the one I feed the most
[45:55] so whatever you feed on young men young
[45:58] women older men older women whatever we
[46:01] feed on that's what we are
[46:02] right all right
[46:04] and it's your free will nobody goes in
[46:06] and turns on those websites for you
[46:09] nobody listens to gossip but you
[46:13] just put everything in there it's your
[46:15] free will to say hey stop
[46:17] your free will you you're a free moral
[46:20] agent you can say nope anytime you want
[46:22] to
[46:23] the problem is is Satan has stroked just
[46:25] enough of desire in there a Humanity
[46:29] that'll override sometimes
[46:32] how many of us have made a mistake and
[46:34] really didn't want to do it
[46:37] we have some Liars in the building
[46:41] so we need to pray for those people
[46:43] we all have done that every one of us
[46:46] has had a thought and it'd be just a
[46:48] complete lie
[46:51] amen
[46:52] all right well that where'd that come
[46:53] from God duh came from the Devil
[46:56] he took a thought that you should had of
[46:59] God maybe and he turned it into what the
[47:02] Bible says turns it into lasciviousness
[47:04] if you hear if you hear something from a
[47:06] preacher and you say boy that's right
[47:08] this is wrong as rain
[47:11] on the moon
[47:13] God didn't give you that
[47:16] the devil got involved
[47:18] it made you think it was the right thing
[47:20] to do that white righteous church that
[47:23] white righteous horse that he got on the
[47:26] ride he didn't ride it out there in the
[47:29] world he wrote it in the church
[47:31] he wrote it in me and you
[47:34] come on somebody let's get close let's
[47:37] bring it here and not start pointing
[47:39] fingers out there let's bring them back
[47:40] to here
[47:42] if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on
[47:44] the things of God if it don't it won't
[47:45] right then right here's what we got
[47:48] a point this morning obeying what God
[47:50] Said do what brought the power what
[47:52] brought the virtues obedience to the
[47:54] word of God so if we're not getting what
[47:58] we need from the word of God we're just
[48:00] not obedient
[48:01] we're not doing what God Said
[48:04] we're disobedient children didn't the
[48:06] Bible tell that would be disobedient
[48:08] children in the end time
[48:09] lovers of pleasure more lovers of God
[48:12] disobedient incontinent and all those
[48:14] other lists of things well that's not
[48:16] out in the denominations my friends it's
[48:18] in every Church there is
[48:22] but the prophet told Saul do this
[48:26] and God will bless you
[48:28] Saul took it on himself and said
[48:31] I think we'll save him two guys
[48:34] I think we'll save all these Rams and
[48:36] all these we can sacrifice them and save
[48:38] ours sounds good
[48:41] but Samuel says Nope to obey is better
[48:45] than sacrifice to hearken than the fat
[48:48] of Rams for Rebellion as as the sin of
[48:52] witchcraft
[48:54] wow we think witchcraft is something
[48:56] done in a basement somewhere you know
[48:58] and they got black lights and they got
[48:59] uh whatever that devil sign is and all
[49:02] that um
[49:03] Rebellion
[49:05] is right here all of us
[49:08] Rebellion is as the son of Witchcraft
[49:11] and stubbornness
[49:14] amen that's what we were talking
[49:16] downstairs we were talking about
[49:16] disrespect and that's what happens when
[49:19] we don't do the will of God we
[49:20] disrespect God and he doesn't have to
[49:22] give you any respect
[49:25] right
[49:26] to disrespect God as we were saying you
[49:28] know disrupts the service or or come in
[49:30] late or something or bring a bad spirit
[49:32] in the church that's stubbornness
[49:35] and what is Iniquity knowing to do
[49:37] better than don't do it or doing it no
[49:38] you shouldn't do it all right we're all
[49:42] fall under this right here stubbornness
[49:45] iniquity idolatry because thou Hast
[49:49] rejected what the word of the Lord
[49:52] that puts us right there we we rejected
[49:54] the word of the Lord just like Saul did
[49:56] and Saul had the kingdom ripped out of
[49:58] his life
[50:01] let's don't have the joy ripped out of
[50:03] our life for doing something we
[50:05] shouldn't do
[50:08] the joy of the Lord is what our strength
[50:12] the joy of the Lord is our virtue the
[50:14] strength to do what we need to do to get
[50:17] through our daily life
[50:18] as Ryan said don't be listening to him
[50:22] um and Sean Hannity is okay all right
[50:24] different ones but why listen to that
[50:28] when you can listen to
[50:30] the voice of God
[50:33] thus saith the Lord
[50:34] amen nothing against Sean Hannity I
[50:38] think he's a pretty good guy but uh he
[50:41] has really nothing spiritually for me to
[50:43] listen to I think so naturally he might
[50:46] help us you know Dave Ramsey in
[50:48] different ones in which we think that
[50:49] you know God's put these people a lot of
[50:51] people in these capacities to help
[50:53] people with I don't think God is the
[50:55] kind of God said no only the bride I'm
[50:57] just going to help them no there's
[50:59] others that he he helps the world if
[51:01] they'll want it
[51:02] all right look he's talking about we're
[51:04] not building an organization I read this
[51:06] morning so let's go through it real
[51:07] quick
[51:08] God didn't send him to build
[51:09] organizations that send him to build
[51:11] individual people
[51:14] one person at a time
[51:17] individual people that they might be the
[51:19] PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the
[51:22] spirit what by his word
[51:26] not by your thoughts
[51:27] not by my thoughts not by my false
[51:30] Doctrine or your false Doctrine but by
[51:31] what by the spirit of God by his word by
[51:34] his word build up that individual to
[51:37] that place
[51:38] to that place
[51:40] what place
[51:44] a moving breathing instrumentality of
[51:46] God
[51:47] all right
[51:48] now we've been talking about virtue we
[51:50] know what that is so let's just keep on
[51:52] going through virtue anyone knows what
[51:54] the world virtue means see it we must
[51:55] have it if virtue went from him to heal
[51:57] the woman that was sick he's expecting
[51:59] the same virtue in his church expecting
[52:01] the same he's expecting the same
[52:04] it's a requirement
[52:06] if Richard Roberts would hear he'd tell
[52:08] you
[52:09] churches he went to before didn't even
[52:11] preach on the Statue of perfect man
[52:12] didn't even think anything about it but
[52:14] when he come here he heard somebody say
[52:18] it's required
[52:19] and then he read the quote where brother
[52:21] Branham said it was required
[52:24] and the Bible says it's required so if
[52:27] the Bible says it's required brother
[52:28] Brown said it's required and brother
[52:30] Dale says it's required
[52:36] it's a requirement for us
[52:38] to grow in this church age
[52:40] it's a requirement for us to overcome in
[52:44] this age that we do
[52:46] and have these virtues working in his
[52:48] life what look and if he had virtue to
[52:51] give to the people he expects us
[52:53] expects us to have virtue to give to the
[52:57] people and as I read you hear down just
[52:59] a few minutes ago not just to you but
[53:00] the whole
[53:02] world
[53:05] listen folks you know as well as I do
[53:07] the whole world is looking for something
[53:11] that's why are going out on these crazy
[53:13] tangents that's why they're going out
[53:14] and searching for first one thing in
[53:16] another if it just sits still long
[53:18] enough and listen to a good Holy Ghost
[53:20] Field preacher it would satisfy a lot of
[53:22] their needs because there's a craving
[53:24] inside of a human being to be right
[53:26] somewhere
[53:27] inside of them to be right to be morally
[53:30] right but now Satan takes over
[53:34] twist it turns it pulls them in the
[53:37] wrong direction that's where our kids
[53:38] are where they're at that's why
[53:39] different ones are where they're at it's
[53:40] because Satan has pulled them and
[53:42] they've listened to him not listen to
[53:44] God all right but we're praying that now
[53:46] they'll listen to God because you know
[53:48] what me and you listen to the devil for
[53:49] a long time
[53:50] amen somebody
[53:52] and now we're listening to God
[53:55] all right we're listening to the word
[53:57] and what he listen he didn't change the
[53:59] Bible when you got born again
[54:07] you were age 12 age of accountability
[54:10] to in my case 37
[54:15] this was always right here
[54:18] what I needed was always in here there
[54:21] was not a development where 10 years ago
[54:24] you know they had to write a book about
[54:26] or 30 years ago they had to write a book
[54:28] about computers well now 50 years ago
[54:29] they didn't need a book about computers
[54:31] because they weren't computers
[54:33] look at Miriam Webster's Dictionary
[54:36] word computers not even in there now it
[54:38] is on the revised Edition
[54:41] but we don't have a Revival this is not
[54:43] a revised Edition
[54:45] this was wrote before the foundation of
[54:46] the world
[54:47] ain't got you in it
[54:49] so it didn't have to change what did we
[54:51] have to do we had to change to fit that
[54:56] we had the chance to fit that
[54:59] right but everybody in the world I
[55:00] talked to some people the other day and
[55:02] they talk in the political realm I said
[55:04] you ain't gonna ever satisfy the
[55:06] political people
[55:08] Democrat Republican libertarian
[55:12] that's the world trying to fix theirself
[55:17] it's the world
[55:18] trying to fix herself and you know what
[55:20] they're gonna fix theirself into the
[55:22] tribulation
[55:24] that's what this is all heading up to
[55:26] everything you see political Putin
[55:29] Russia China all these different places
[55:31] they're moving and we know what's going
[55:33] to happen
[55:34] but praise God's name forever we won't
[55:37] be here to see it
[55:40] we'll walk out on the ashes of those
[55:42] Wicked people
[55:44] poached Kings
[55:47] great people
[55:48] they're not born again guess what their
[55:51] ashes under the soles of your feet
[55:53] and I hate that and I and and God does
[55:56] too God hates it he hates to have to
[55:58] send somebody to hell because you send
[56:00] yourself to Hell really he don't send
[56:01] you to hell
[56:03] he made the hell for the devil for his
[56:05] devil and his angels He didn't make hell
[56:06] for you but that's not a place to put
[56:08] you if you're not in God
[56:09] so he had to make a place to put you
[56:12] you have to crawl over the cross you
[56:14] have to crawl over the blood of Jesus to
[56:16] get to hell
[56:18] now he talked about Mr Reverend Mr Lilly
[56:21] we talked about this morning what did a
[56:23] lily have what does a flower have a
[56:25] flower has something that what they give
[56:27] out so we're talking about this as a
[56:29] human giving out virtue or as a as a
[56:31] member of the body of Christ it opens
[56:34] itself up for honey for the bee to come
[56:36] and get his part don't complain and see
[56:38] that's the same thing with you and I
[56:39] about the world the world is looking for
[56:40] something
[56:42] listen show them something different
[56:46] show them something different show them
[56:48] you don't I went to a party last night
[56:51] they were drinking
[56:53] so did I coffee
[56:58] like where's Esther I had a six-pack
[57:04] Coke
[57:07] but now see
[57:10] you said well you shouldn't have went no
[57:11] they're people I work with every day so
[57:13] they know we're different
[57:15] praise God they know we're different so
[57:17] they never offered me a dream
[57:20] she actually had to find a coffee
[57:21] machine
[57:23] and she had cleaned it out with vinegar
[57:25] several months before to put it up and
[57:27] the cop first run a coffee tastes like
[57:29] vinegar
[57:30] so they had to make about six cups so
[57:32] anyway but we had just as much fun
[57:35] as they did drinking their alcohol and
[57:38] then it shames the Hound out of them
[57:39] because they're the even the owner of
[57:41] the house she's over here in the corner
[57:44] oh okay
[57:47] I say yeah yeah or Darlene I said what
[57:50] are you doing over there
[57:52] and I saw she had like ginger ale or
[57:53] something whatever she had over here on
[57:54] the side she said I said no that other
[57:56] stuff Jim said that white stuff right
[57:58] over there
[58:01] it was tequila
[58:03] that water in a bottle a bottle of water
[58:05] that's what she got a bottle of water is
[58:06] a bottle of water but you see that but
[58:08] you mingle with the girl with the world
[58:10] though but you don't have to be of that
[58:13] world you can sit there and they sit
[58:15] there and drink their uh Strawberry Wine
[58:17] didn't bother me one bit I drank my
[58:19] coffee
[58:21] but you know what it was it was a
[58:23] condemnation to them because they had to
[58:25] get over listen in their own house
[58:27] now listen in my own house I do pretty
[58:29] much what I want to because I pay the
[58:30] bills right
[58:32] king of my castle all right June tells
[58:35] me that all the time
[58:36] she tells me what to be
[58:39] but
[58:41] I wear the pants in the family because
[58:43] she can't
[58:47] but you listen think about though you
[58:49] have to have to get in the corner of
[58:51] their own house
[58:52] to hide what they're doing because of
[58:55] the condemnation that we bring just
[58:57] walking into the house
[58:59] them knowing
[59:00] and hiding everything you know hiding
[59:03] everything you know putting the bottle
[59:04] up but they get over there and they get
[59:06] in the corner you know well you know
[59:08] what they're doing
[59:09] but it shames them so much and that's
[59:11] okay but I tell people
[59:13] dad's always even even when we were
[59:15] hunting and Groton that is the same way
[59:17] he said look he said guys don't stop
[59:20] drinking because I don't drink
[59:22] actually one day he said I'll go get you
[59:24] a beer if you need one well I mean
[59:26] they're gonna drink anyway so what's the
[59:28] matter
[59:29] but don't be shy I mean don't make us
[59:31] and he told one said look if we make you
[59:33] uncomfortable I'm sorry
[59:34] he told a bunch a group of people over
[59:36] there a long time ago he said we make
[59:38] you comfortable too I'm sorry but this
[59:40] is just who we are you be who you are
[59:42] don't worry about me you be who you are
[59:44] I'll be who I am we'll have a we'll have
[59:46] a party
[59:47] hey man last night we had a party we
[59:50] laughed and cut up they drank their
[59:52] alcohol we drank our coffee and inspired
[59:54] or whatever it was we had and and but
[59:57] see maybe something will come out of
[59:59] that one day
[1:00:01] maybe a condemnation will become more
[1:00:03] than just going over in the corner and
[1:00:05] pouring the drink
[1:00:06] and not cursing you know
[1:00:09] around us
[1:00:10] that's okay
[1:00:12] but they knew we were different
[1:00:14] they knew not to even tempt us and offer
[1:00:19] us a drink why because they know our
[1:00:20] background just like we're going to read
[1:00:22] here in just a little while where Ruth
[1:00:24] Boaz looks at Ruth and says the whole
[1:00:27] city knows you're a virtuous woman
[1:00:30] whole city
[1:00:31] not just your immediate family or your
[1:00:34] immediate employees or your employer
[1:00:37] the whole world
[1:00:38] will you go in Walmart you open the door
[1:00:41] for people
[1:00:42] and you say God bless you
[1:00:45] you do like I say you now listen this is
[1:00:48] Christmas time
[1:00:50] there's toys laying all over the floor I
[1:00:53] didn't try to pick all them up the other
[1:00:54] day
[1:00:55] but normally I'll pick something up put
[1:00:57] it back on the Shelf but it looked like
[1:00:59] Santa Claus had blew up the blew up the
[1:01:02] bag you know I'm down to the house so I
[1:01:04] just said oh sorry Lord and you know
[1:01:06] what though he reminded me though or the
[1:01:09] devil did says hey you told them people
[1:01:11] that you put it back better than I said
[1:01:13] I do I said but I'm not going to pick up
[1:01:15] a napkin on the side of the in the
[1:01:18] parking lot of the post office and it
[1:01:20] looks like it's got something on it I
[1:01:21] don't need to have my hands on
[1:01:22] hey man I mean there's stupidity and
[1:01:25] then there's doing what you do now the
[1:01:27] other things like the other day there
[1:01:28] was orange peelings or something I
[1:01:30] picked them up throw them in the trash
[1:01:31] can
[1:01:32] that don't make me no better but you
[1:01:34] know what it does somebody may be
[1:01:35] looking to say hey he's trying to make
[1:01:36] it better
[1:01:38] and so I said for the whole world that's
[1:01:40] what brother Brown was telling us for
[1:01:41] the whole world you got to have virtue
[1:01:42] for the whole world
[1:01:44] because this whole world is being kept
[1:01:46] together by me and you
[1:01:48] because when we leave it's going to be
[1:01:50] utter chaos
[1:01:52] those people that you think are good
[1:01:54] people they will cut your throat they
[1:01:57] won't cut hours because we'll be gone
[1:01:58] but they'll cut their neighbor's throat
[1:02:00] for an apple
[1:02:03] smart educated people
[1:02:06] will be the worst
[1:02:08] because they don't know how to survive
[1:02:11] they'll come out of them inner cities
[1:02:13] and they'll come after us not us but
[1:02:14] come after people that know how to raise
[1:02:16] crops they know how to do this I don't
[1:02:18] know why I'm telling you this but this
[1:02:19] is part of life
[1:02:22] but that's the virtue
[1:02:24] I want them to draw virtue off all of us
[1:02:26] brothers and sisters
[1:02:27] every one of us even you young kids in
[1:02:29] school when you say no
[1:02:32] and everybody else says yes
[1:02:35] yeah they're going to persecute you
[1:02:38] yeah they're gonna call you crazy
[1:02:40] they gonna call you different
[1:02:42] so what
[1:02:44] praise God
[1:02:46] praise God that they noticed that you're
[1:02:49] different
[1:02:51] because there's a lot of people I know
[1:02:53] and that's been in the message that
[1:02:54] growing up that the girls as soon as
[1:02:56] they left the house and got on the bus
[1:02:57] they had their britches hidden well they
[1:03:00] ain't going there
[1:03:01] anyway so that was not really a
[1:03:06] that wasn't very much of a witness
[1:03:08] but girls y'all don't do that please
[1:03:11] please don't please don't be a false
[1:03:13] witness
[1:03:14] be a true Witness
[1:03:16] you wear your clothes because it's
[1:03:17] different from the world
[1:03:20] all of us
[1:03:22] we wear our clothes you know you how
[1:03:24] many tattoos you got now that's what how
[1:03:26] many tattoos how many piercings you got
[1:03:30] because it's a normal thing but for you
[1:03:32] and I you they look at you and they go
[1:03:34] what do you do I go to church on Sunday
[1:03:36] what
[1:03:37] yeah I go to church on Sunday you ought
[1:03:38] to try it sometime
[1:03:40] foreign
[1:03:43] he's not selfish
[1:03:45] he's got older
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ was not selfish he died for
[1:03:48] every person
[1:03:49] but he knew
[1:03:51] who would and who wouldn't
[1:03:53] he knew when he came here all seven or
[1:03:55] there's now eight billion people in the
[1:03:56] world that you know we just turned over
[1:03:57] to 8 billion just a few days ago there's
[1:03:59] eight billion people in this world
[1:04:01] there's probably not 10 million people
[1:04:03] that are Christians
[1:04:06] could you imagine
[1:04:09] wow and then when those 10 million leave
[1:04:12] the Earth guess what's going to happen
[1:04:13] utter chaos
[1:04:15] because everybody's going to be killing
[1:04:17] everybody else
[1:04:19] we're the only people that bring sanity
[1:04:20] to this world
[1:04:22] you and I the daily things we do the
[1:04:24] even even listen even paying bills and
[1:04:27] we should be up here from everybody else
[1:04:31] we should be up to here and and not be
[1:04:34] like the world even in that way
[1:04:36] because you know what everybody's
[1:04:37] watching everything
[1:04:39] I know your credit score
[1:04:42] I hope not
[1:04:46] but what am I talking about
[1:04:48] something is pulling us
[1:04:51] something keeps holding me isn't that
[1:04:54] the song I didn't hold it it held me
[1:04:58] something keeps holding me what pulling
[1:05:01] me up something keeps pulling me to this
[1:05:03] church not just this building
[1:05:05] something pulls me to listen to the
[1:05:07] ministry of this church something pulls
[1:05:09] me to act different than the world
[1:05:10] something's pulling me not pushing me
[1:05:14] that's what the problem is we get pushed
[1:05:16] a lot of times and we don't want to get
[1:05:17] pushed you get pushed and you know what
[1:05:20] I'm talking about
[1:05:21] it goes up airport Temperance we'll talk
[1:05:23] about that a little bit later
[1:05:25] hey man don't push me
[1:05:31] I want to be like to treat people like
[1:05:33] the Frog you know how to bowl a frog
[1:05:34] right you're supposed to bowl a frog
[1:05:35] when it's live
[1:05:37] Michael you understand
[1:05:39] you know what you do you put them in a
[1:05:40] pot you don't put it in boiling water
[1:05:42] you put him in a pot of warm water
[1:05:44] then you just keep turning the heat up a
[1:05:46] little at a time he's boiling right and
[1:05:48] you don't he don't even realize he's
[1:05:49] being bald all of a sudden he's about
[1:05:51] he's bald he's a ball frog
[1:05:53] same way that's what the devil does me
[1:05:55] and you too he doesn't long time Jump in
[1:05:56] on us and say he'll say I'm gonna get
[1:05:58] you in the pot and I'm going to start
[1:06:00] turning the heat up
[1:06:02] but look to attract the third pull the
[1:06:05] three pulls we we preached many years
[1:06:07] ago about the three pulls of our journey
[1:06:10] and we still believe there is
[1:06:13] justification sanctification of baptism
[1:06:15] of the Holy Ghost but he came as what
[1:06:18] brother Brown will take him by the hand
[1:06:20] bumps would come on his hand he said
[1:06:22] okay you got this disease then he would
[1:06:24] look at it again he would grab their
[1:06:26] hand and he would pronounce them healed
[1:06:28] or that they still had it
[1:06:30] then you got to the discernment where he
[1:06:33] could actually what pull out everything
[1:06:34] in their life
[1:06:36] pull out where they came from where they
[1:06:38] lived what they were going to do I see
[1:06:40] you as an old man I see you as a young
[1:06:42] man he's that he's just pulling he's
[1:06:44] pulling their life out I want that to
[1:06:46] happen today
[1:06:48] we're under that pool right there of
[1:06:50] discernment as the discernment of the
[1:06:52] words going forth is pulling out and
[1:06:54] what if you're either letting it correct
[1:06:56] you or you're dying one of the two
[1:06:58] you're letting it correct you or you're
[1:07:00] shutting yourself off and God can't help
[1:07:02] you if you shut the door
[1:07:03] all right then the third poll is the
[1:07:06] opening of the word brother Brian said
[1:07:07] he can't be impersonated all right
[1:07:10] listen brother Brown said these virtues
[1:07:12] are god-given virtues but there's a lot
[1:07:15] of people in the world that have these
[1:07:16] virtues that are not born again
[1:07:19] some of them but they can't have them
[1:07:21] all the way like me and you because
[1:07:22] there's not a holy ghost there to keep
[1:07:25] what pulling us
[1:07:29] so we'll get to that later on the
[1:07:30] opening of the word you can't
[1:07:32] impersonate when you get to Revelation
[1:07:33] when those seals open to that prophet
[1:07:35] and they opened Us in the end time
[1:07:38] then Satan can't impersonate that he
[1:07:41] can't stand the word so he's not going
[1:07:42] to be able to delve into it like we can
[1:07:44] all right
[1:07:45] so now brother Brown's talking about the
[1:07:48] apostles talking about how they acted
[1:07:49] they went around probably meant a few
[1:07:51] words so they got in the Pulpit they
[1:07:53] walked in they'd done what they were
[1:07:54] supposed to do and they walked out yes
[1:07:57] sir they had power they had virtue they
[1:07:59] had no arguments with men they knew
[1:08:01] where they stood
[1:08:02] that's what I want us to be I want us to
[1:08:04] be a church that knows where we're
[1:08:05] standing knows who we are every time any
[1:08:07] time any time of the day they know who
[1:08:10] they believed
[1:08:11] they kept on walking in the spirit doing
[1:08:14] only in other words doing only what they
[1:08:15] got that little nod how could they know
[1:08:18] it was a nod from God they had all these
[1:08:20] virtues in here all these brother around
[1:08:23] calls them qualifications now if it's a
[1:08:25] qualification it's a requirement
[1:08:27] all right if it's a qualification it's a
[1:08:29] requirement you're you are you have a
[1:08:31] requirement to what we were talking
[1:08:33] about the twins back there getting ready
[1:08:35] to turn
[1:08:36] 16 years old
[1:08:39] wow yeah you ain't kidding wow
[1:08:41] well it's a qualification that they that
[1:08:43] they take drivers training that they
[1:08:45] take a year of of uh of what you call um
[1:08:49] you gotta have somebody in the car with
[1:08:50] you you know uh gotta have training
[1:08:53] wheels on their car and all this stuff
[1:08:55] but then it comes but you got to do that
[1:08:56] before you get your regular license it's
[1:08:58] a qualification that they go through the
[1:08:59] learner's permit part all right same way
[1:09:02] with God there's it's required that we
[1:09:03] go to a learner's permit part God
[1:09:05] doesn't mind if you're a baby
[1:09:07] he doesn't mind it at all he Minds if 20
[1:09:10] years later you're still a baby
[1:09:14] the first little nod from God compared
[1:09:16] with every bit of this and with his word
[1:09:18] they knowed it was the word of God and
[1:09:20] the way they went didn't have to worry
[1:09:22] about nothing else when God spoke
[1:09:25] they went
[1:09:26] you know why because they were taught by
[1:09:27] the word of God so now that we see if
[1:09:29] the son of man Ministries back in power
[1:09:31] now in US then we're being taught by the
[1:09:35] word of God the same word of God that's
[1:09:37] a 12 or 11 disciples were trained up by
[1:09:40] the Lord Jesus that's why that Ministry
[1:09:42] had to come back that's why brother
[1:09:43] Branham had to be the end time Prophet
[1:09:46] the one to bring everything back
[1:09:48] together again thereby with me those of
[1:09:50] you that are awake it's hot in here
[1:09:53] that's for sure Revelation 6 verse 1
[1:09:55] says I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:09:57] the seals and I heard is where the noise
[1:09:58] of Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:10:00] come and see now what is the voice of
[1:10:02] Thunder brother Brown said that was the
[1:10:04] voice of God when the seal breaks so
[1:10:06] when something breaks forth what happens
[1:10:10] something happens there's a reaction
[1:10:13] one of the four B said come and see now
[1:10:15] what was that for what was that Beast it
[1:10:16] was a lion it was a power you can see
[1:10:19] where I got it on the on the screen not
[1:10:21] lying lying l-o-n that was a line power
[1:10:24] which was what it was the true righteous
[1:10:26] Church listen there had to be a true
[1:10:28] righteous church for there to be a false
[1:10:30] one
[1:10:31] Satan cannot create Satan cannot make
[1:10:34] the first church
[1:10:36] I looked up that word yesterday First
[1:10:37] Church there's about a hundred and
[1:10:39] something quotes for brother talks about
[1:10:41] the First Church Catholic Church says
[1:10:43] they're the first church brother Adam
[1:10:44] agreed with them he said if you'd have
[1:10:45] stayed like the first church you could
[1:10:47] have been the first church
[1:10:49] but the first church was the disciples
[1:10:51] Silver and Gold Have I None Paul doing
[1:10:54] the things he did and all the different
[1:10:55] things in the book of Acts then what
[1:10:57] happened is brother Robin said they got
[1:10:59] away from that first church we'll read
[1:11:01] it here in just a few minutes you've
[1:11:02] lost your first love
[1:11:04] so have we lost our first love
[1:11:07] think about it and I saw on behold the
[1:11:10] White Horse boy looks good
[1:11:11] he's not dirty he's not muddy he's white
[1:11:15] and he that sat on him had a bowl when
[1:11:16] the crown was given unto him
[1:11:18] and he went forth conquering into
[1:11:20] conquer thou that word white means what
[1:11:22] it means light
[1:11:24] Satan is what Satan has become what a
[1:11:27] messenger of light he has become light
[1:11:29] that is the most Darkness there is he
[1:11:32] has become the light of this world
[1:11:34] not our world this world because
[1:11:37] everything is illuminated by the devil
[1:11:39] he wants you to go to the biggest shows
[1:11:41] he wants to put the most football games
[1:11:43] on he wants you to party the most he
[1:11:45] wants to have all the glitter and all
[1:11:47] the glamor 5G now four whatever HD
[1:11:52] everything what more plain
[1:11:55] so that you can see every detail well
[1:11:58] thank God we got a message that's more
[1:12:01] than 4D it's give us back from the
[1:12:04] foundation of the world all the way to
[1:12:06] the Future Hall and he'd give it to us
[1:12:08] in Vivid color
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:12] I can almost see the lives of that City
[1:12:16] can almost see that I see them gathering
[1:12:19] around the water great white throne
[1:12:22] but look brilliance
[1:12:24] it looks kind of nice if you just took
[1:12:26] that scripture and said oh well that's
[1:12:27] that's that's that's the mighty
[1:12:29] conqueror he's going forth conquering
[1:12:31] and to conquer where brother Ram didn't
[1:12:33] read that one little part right there
[1:12:35] that says he had a bow
[1:12:39] but no arrows
[1:12:41] he said therefore he was a bluff
[1:12:46] he had a bow with no arrows
[1:12:48] he was on a wild horse
[1:12:52] now brother Brian knew that that lion
[1:12:54] power allowing power was in that first
[1:12:57] church age and it was a white righteous
[1:12:59] Church they didn't have the
[1:13:00] denominations they didn't have all the
[1:13:02] different things all the Scruples now it
[1:13:03] got started though right but then there
[1:13:06] was group was involved but you see this
[1:13:08] scenario and you think man this is great
[1:13:11] that's the same thing that you say why
[1:13:13] are you doing this because look you can
[1:13:15] take every one of these and you can
[1:13:17] claim to have them all and pretend you
[1:13:19] have some of them what brother mom talk
[1:13:20] about the peacock
[1:13:22] the blackbird with a peacock feathers he
[1:13:24] said you can stick to feathers in the in
[1:13:26] the crow but it's still a crow
[1:13:29] so they're going to what they're going
[1:13:30] to interpret or are right there white
[1:13:34] horse brother Brown says ride it all the
[1:13:36] way into eternity that why horses still
[1:13:38] riding today those people think they're
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:41] they have the white righteous Church
[1:13:43] in their eyes
[1:13:46] everybody with me
[1:13:47] use of white garments as the sign of
[1:13:51] innocence and purity of soul
[1:13:54] boy Satan would love for you to
[1:13:56] look at him as being innocent wouldn't
[1:13:58] he
[1:14:00] that's what the deceiver is he wants you
[1:14:02] to think that but there is a group of
[1:14:05] people that's going to put on white
[1:14:07] robes and they're going to ride white
[1:14:08] horses and it's going to be us
[1:14:10] all right
[1:14:11] but this conquering was what
[1:14:13] conquering's a laity or what they
[1:14:15] overcame the first church AIDS all that
[1:14:18] first three Church ages
[1:14:20] Satan got in the church he didn't get in
[1:14:22] the world he got into church
[1:14:25] me and you
[1:14:28] and he prevailed he conquered
[1:14:33] there's a group of people that he
[1:14:35] couldn't conquer
[1:14:37] Revelations 2 verse 4 says nevertheless
[1:14:39] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:14:40] thou has left thy First Love remember
[1:14:42] therefore from whence Thou Art fallen
[1:14:44] and repent and do the first words listen
[1:14:48] that may have come out from the church
[1:14:49] first church days but that's in this age
[1:14:52] because we had to go back we lost our
[1:14:54] first love we had to go back to the
[1:14:55] first church age before they lost their
[1:14:58] first love come on somebody
[1:15:01] remember therefore from when you're
[1:15:03] falling and repent and do the first
[1:15:05] words or else I will come unto thee
[1:15:07] quickly and will judge you
[1:15:11] that's what that means I'm gonna pull
[1:15:12] your Candlestick out
[1:15:14] accept thou repent
[1:15:17] but this thou Hast that thou hate us
[1:15:19] today the Nicolaitans there's a little
[1:15:21] bit of light
[1:15:22] which I also hate
[1:15:25] he didn't have to near let him hear what
[1:15:27] the spirit said to the churches look to
[1:15:28] him that overcometh
[1:15:30] will I give to eat of the tree of life
[1:15:32] now who's the Tree of Life Jesus Christ
[1:15:34] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:15:36] God listen there was a false power that
[1:15:39] came in but there's a true power that's
[1:15:41] here there was a true power even in the
[1:15:43] first church age but what happened was
[1:15:45] Satan said hey this is the way to do it
[1:15:47] I'm going to make mine louder I'm going
[1:15:50] to make mine all white I'm going to make
[1:15:52] it a purple robe I'm going to make it a
[1:15:54] Vatican I'm going to put diamonds in it
[1:15:57] I'm gonna put jewelry in it I'm gonna
[1:15:59] I'm gonna actually I'm gonna take from
[1:16:02] the poor
[1:16:03] and give to the rich
[1:16:06] I was reading a quote just now brother
[1:16:07] Brown said well no it was here remember
[1:16:10] here when he said it was over in Mexico
[1:16:11] he said little Pedro will go take his
[1:16:13] little two pences and put it on a
[1:16:15] million dollar altar that's what the
[1:16:17] Catholic Church did they stole from
[1:16:19] those people and gave them nothing in
[1:16:22] return
[1:16:23] zero
[1:16:25] but now not me and you but see that was
[1:16:26] that false power
[1:16:28] now a devout Catholic will tell you the
[1:16:31] pope is God or Jesus Christ or instead
[1:16:34] of right
[1:16:37] exactly
[1:16:39] and he's infallible
[1:16:41] if he says something contrary to the
[1:16:43] Bible you take what the Pope says
[1:16:46] now is that not deception
[1:16:48] that is a false power that's covering
[1:16:50] this whole world this whole world is
[1:16:52] going to be deceived folks if your
[1:16:54] name's not written Revelation 13 8
[1:16:57] oh
[1:16:58] all on the earth will be deceived except
[1:17:01] here you have your name written in the
[1:17:03] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:04] foundation of the world you're going to
[1:17:06] be deceived if you're not right
[1:17:09] and Brad really is going to be deceived
[1:17:11] up right up to the last moment sorry he
[1:17:14] said it would deceive the very elect if
[1:17:15] it were possible
[1:17:17] all right
[1:17:18] let me read this and then we'll close
[1:17:20] y'all ain't getting a thing because
[1:17:21] y'all asleep
[1:17:24] let me read this real quick
[1:17:27] pinch yourself just a minute
[1:17:29] now the mystery of the book
[1:17:32] now the mystery of the book look are
[1:17:34] revealed when the seals are broke the
[1:17:36] reason I'm going to talk let me read
[1:17:38] this whole thing and it's going to fit
[1:17:39] with what we're talking about
[1:17:41] and when the seals completely are broken
[1:17:43] hold on now when the seals are
[1:17:45] completely broken
[1:17:48] the time of redemption is over now look
[1:17:50] the time of redemption is not over now
[1:17:53] because the sales hadn't been all
[1:17:54] totally broke
[1:17:56] oh yeah they're open
[1:17:58] but are they open to you are they broke
[1:18:01] to other people are they broke to other
[1:18:02] brothers that need to have it broke to
[1:18:04] them all right man
[1:18:06] because we're look when that last name
[1:18:08] comes in when that seal when you come to
[1:18:11] that Sixth Seal and the Seven seal comes
[1:18:13] on the earth which is Christ in you and
[1:18:14] me
[1:18:15] redemption's over there's nobody else
[1:18:17] going to be saved and I pray that that's
[1:18:19] not happened because I got kids out
[1:18:21] there I've got Kinfolk out there I've
[1:18:23] got friends out there that need to come
[1:18:25] in get in this art before God shuts the
[1:18:27] door and you do too
[1:18:29] so you better pray for them pray
[1:18:30] redemption's not over
[1:18:32] I know it's not because I keep I still
[1:18:34] need it
[1:18:36] so when they're completely broke the
[1:18:38] time of redemption is over because the
[1:18:40] land lamb left the intercession post
[1:18:42] he's talking about Revelations 5 in
[1:18:45] symbol to walk out to take his claims
[1:18:48] now what is his claims
[1:18:51] a redeemed Church
[1:18:53] he's not claiming where the world or the
[1:18:55] Earth
[1:18:57] he created it it's his he actually give
[1:19:00] it to us
[1:19:01] but he's coming to claim that group of
[1:19:03] people
[1:19:05] because the lamb left the intercession
[1:19:07] post to walk out to take his claims he
[1:19:10] was a mediator between that he was a
[1:19:12] mediator
[1:19:15] but when the real Revelation happens on
[1:19:18] the seals as they begin to break the
[1:19:21] lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary
[1:19:22] now there's no way he can come forth
[1:19:24] from the sanctuary
[1:19:26] and get into a group of people until we
[1:19:29] have these virtues working their life we
[1:19:31] can't just jump from run one all the way
[1:19:32] up number seven
[1:19:33] we got to go through a process and
[1:19:35] that's our process
[1:19:37] it's according to the word we read it
[1:19:39] last night it's talking about
[1:19:40] Revelations 5. out of the message took
[1:19:42] the book so he's no more mediator
[1:19:43] because they even they called him a lion
[1:19:45] that's the king he's not a mediator then
[1:19:47] now watch this he's bringing in a word
[1:19:50] here I want to bring in although the
[1:19:52] actors
[1:19:54] of these seals began at the first church
[1:19:57] age
[1:19:59] all right now remember
[1:20:01] we'll get the background of it
[1:20:03] thoroughly if we can or as thoroughly as
[1:20:04] possible the actors I'll place it like
[1:20:07] that because an actor is a man who
[1:20:09] changes his mask
[1:20:11] all right
[1:20:12] and in this act tonight
[1:20:15] he we're going to see that it's Satan
[1:20:18] changing his Mass
[1:20:20] now watch hold on Matt
[1:20:23] he changes it right here
[1:20:25] and all actors dot dot dot he he pauses
[1:20:28] Christ
[1:20:30] acting the part as he did when he became
[1:20:33] from a spirit to a man
[1:20:36] he acted the part of death
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:42] now think about this hold on man it'll
[1:20:43] give you he'll help you with this
[1:20:45] because you say well why are you talking
[1:20:47] about an actor somebody's acting up no
[1:20:48] be careful listen to what brother
[1:20:50] Brown's saying he's saying the same guy
[1:20:52] is just changing his mask
[1:20:56] he's not changing his person
[1:20:58] he's changing his mask he's changing his
[1:21:01] form
[1:21:02] everybody with me he's God
[1:21:05] I'm God and I change not
[1:21:07] but for one moment in time he changed
[1:21:09] himself two times
[1:21:11] put on a mask which is this
[1:21:14] put on a flash mask
[1:21:16] and what redeemed us
[1:21:19] became from Spirit to man look he only
[1:21:22] put on an actor's garment human flesh
[1:21:26] and came down in the form of a man what
[1:21:29] in order to Be Our Redeemer
[1:21:33] and he brought every one of these
[1:21:35] virtues with him when he came on Earth
[1:21:38] now now you see it's only an actor's
[1:21:40] form
[1:21:42] that's the reason they are all in
[1:21:45] parables
[1:21:46] and symbols
[1:21:48] the way that they are here like beasts
[1:21:50] and animals so forth is in an act
[1:21:53] and these actors begin in the first
[1:21:56] church age
[1:21:57] both sets
[1:22:00] Jesus Christ was in the first church he
[1:22:02] become what he become from what savior
[1:22:06] to bride
[1:22:09] the bride put on that same mask
[1:22:12] he said go to Jerusalem
[1:22:14] he prayed in John 17 that they would be
[1:22:17] one like we're one he put us all back
[1:22:19] together he just took that mass and said
[1:22:21] I'm going to be a bride now for seven
[1:22:22] Church ages because what did he do
[1:22:24] remember what John when he was on the
[1:22:25] Isle of Palms he said I heard the voice
[1:22:27] I turned and looked and what he saw what
[1:22:30] son of man
[1:22:33] son of man
[1:22:35] with his mask on
[1:22:37] but he was in feminist form because he
[1:22:39] was what gird about the pipes or breasts
[1:22:41] so he was in the feminist form but John
[1:22:43] knew who he was
[1:22:45] these actors began in the first church
[1:22:47] age so these let and I'm listen there's
[1:22:49] a difference in being an actor in acting
[1:22:52] all right so be careful we can act these
[1:22:55] virtues but if we are the right actor
[1:22:56] for the bride
[1:22:58] if we're Jesus Christ now veiled
[1:23:01] behind that Veil
[1:23:05] then these virtues watch right here I
[1:23:07] read it right here because it was Christ
[1:23:09] revealing himself
[1:23:11] to may I say the bride that says seven
[1:23:14] Church ages but that's the bride
[1:23:16] revealing himself now wait a minute
[1:23:20] brother Branham
[1:23:22] Shake Yourself for a minute we'll be
[1:23:23] done in just a second
[1:23:24] wait a minute he's talking about
[1:23:26] revealing himself to the seven Church
[1:23:28] ages but hiding behind a mask
[1:23:35] hiding behind me and you
[1:23:38] hiding behind us
[1:23:41] now you understand it all right no they
[1:23:43] probably didn't
[1:23:45] but he wanted to what reveal himself
[1:23:49] to the churches or to the bride or as
[1:23:52] the bride
[1:23:54] but now we come down to the church age
[1:23:56] and we'll keep reading we'll go to the
[1:23:58] next not today but when you get to the
[1:24:00] end it's the requirement that you and I
[1:24:02] what become him
[1:24:05] she is him
[1:24:08] all right hold on a minute
[1:24:11] see look Christ revealing himself to the
[1:24:14] seven Church ages in other words he put
[1:24:16] the mask on to the world you and I today
[1:24:18] are an absolute mystery to this world
[1:24:23] because we don't act like the world we
[1:24:25] don't look back the world we've got on
[1:24:27] what that road that mask of Christ we've
[1:24:29] got on that actors
[1:24:32] but we know who we are behind that
[1:24:34] brother Brown when he went and watched
[1:24:36] that place that one man played many
[1:24:38] different parts he played Hamlet he
[1:24:40] played was it Julie C no Romeo and
[1:24:43] Juliet he played several parts amen the
[1:24:47] same man has
[1:24:48] played every part
[1:24:50] for seven Church ages and had a
[1:24:54] characteristic in every Church age
[1:24:55] Revelations one two three but when you
[1:24:57] come to the end time there's one person
[1:25:00] he says
[1:25:02] I in Revelations what 3 14 the beginning
[1:25:07] of the creation of God not an actor the
[1:25:12] beginning of the creation of God the son
[1:25:14] of man back again in human flesh in me
[1:25:17] and you hid to the world but we know who
[1:25:20] we are behind that
[1:25:22] listen all the people that are
[1:25:25] associated with us
[1:25:27] they know who's behind that mask
[1:25:30] because there's a revelation because you
[1:25:31] know what one day he's going to do he's
[1:25:32] going to pull that mask off
[1:25:35] come on somebody
[1:25:37] she is him and he's going to be standing
[1:25:40] on the earth in her
[1:25:43] and the whole world
[1:25:44] is going to know it just for a moment of
[1:25:46] time
[1:25:47] they're going to know who we are because
[1:25:49] we're going to be a Powerhouse
[1:25:52] I'll read it to you in just a minute
[1:25:54] look then at the
[1:26:03] SE lost Mysteries and give it to the
[1:26:05] church now we'll notice that but
[1:26:08] look but the not then revealed in their
[1:26:12] true state
[1:26:14] because if it would have been revealed
[1:26:15] in a true State the first church age
[1:26:16] would have took rapture
[1:26:18] they're by with me just for a minute the
[1:26:20] first church age would have took rapture
[1:26:22] but it couldn't happen that way it had
[1:26:24] to come through seven Church ages or
[1:26:26] seven What actors of God
[1:26:31] but God knows who he is all the whole
[1:26:33] time and we do now because we look back
[1:26:35] and that's why brother Brown says I
[1:26:37] don't call you church anymore I call you
[1:26:39] bride
[1:26:40] because there was a church that got
[1:26:41] behind a mask too because old Satan
[1:26:43] buddy he's right there too
[1:26:45] he put on his mask and said I'm a white
[1:26:47] righteous Church
[1:26:48] but I'm going to make you pay
[1:26:50] I'm gonna kill you
[1:26:52] I'm going to make you disbelieve the
[1:26:54] word of God
[1:26:55] I'm going to make you under the guise of
[1:26:57] a crusade I'm gonna make you either take
[1:27:00] me or I'm going to kill you 68 million
[1:27:03] people give their life
[1:27:05] because of that actor
[1:27:07] called the devil
[1:27:09] all right but look not then revealed in
[1:27:11] their true State now not that it's false
[1:27:13] but remember Revelation 3 14 says what
[1:27:16] the faithful and true witness not that
[1:27:18] he was once false
[1:27:20] but you get a true ring if you ever had
[1:27:22] one of those things that you that you uh
[1:27:25] um
[1:27:26] the guy comes up here and you know and
[1:27:28] he Tunes to he Tunes it with a tuning
[1:27:30] fork
[1:27:31] that's a true C or D brother Ryan you
[1:27:34] know it's a true whatever he's got if he
[1:27:36] hits it and it goes see then he adjusts
[1:27:42] whatever that is in there they're
[1:27:43] strings right
[1:27:45] same thing with the next one he'll do
[1:27:47] and it'll be the it'll be the sound of f
[1:27:50] well that's what's happening now it's
[1:27:52] being revealed in his true state it was
[1:27:54] open partially in the first church age
[1:27:56] because there was a white righteous
[1:27:57] Church went riding out but they didn't
[1:27:59] know what to do
[1:28:01] totally
[1:28:03] you and I now what do we do
[1:28:05] we look back and see every bit of it
[1:28:08] we have no excuse
[1:28:09] the seals have been open so we can look
[1:28:11] all the way back and see how that first
[1:28:13] church Aid started the second Church age
[1:28:15] the Third Church Ace
[1:28:17] and even though the characteristic by
[1:28:19] the person that brother Branham said
[1:28:21] this one was Paul this one's I read us
[1:28:24] that one's Martin this one's Columbus
[1:28:25] this one's Luther this one's Wesley and
[1:28:28] this one was him all right
[1:28:30] now watch just for a second
[1:28:32] now in the Bible times the Mysteries
[1:28:34] were there
[1:28:38] so remember brother Brown didn't bring
[1:28:39] us a new Bible the Mysteries were
[1:28:41] already there
[1:28:42] and they've seen these things happen the
[1:28:45] way John saw it here
[1:28:48] now he said there's a white horse John
[1:28:50] saw a white horse right off
[1:28:53] right right and everybody in the world
[1:28:56] believed that was the Lord Jesus and
[1:28:58] that was the Holy Ghost it was the devil
[1:29:01] John was only commissioned to write what
[1:29:02] he saw
[1:29:04] but the symbol that he saw took a
[1:29:06] prophet to break it down for us he's got
[1:29:08] a bow but he don't have any arrows he
[1:29:10] must be a bluff well now if he's a bluff
[1:29:12] then that everything else
[1:29:14] you knows the devil when that first seal
[1:29:17] broke he knew then that second seal was
[1:29:20] not God he and the red horse and then
[1:29:22] the black horse he knew each one of
[1:29:24] these symbols from the very first one it
[1:29:27] opened
[1:29:28] what are you saying brother Wayne if we
[1:29:30] don't have virtue we'll never get to the
[1:29:32] next step
[1:29:34] we got to have virtue flowing through us
[1:29:37] where we're a virtuous Church a virtuous
[1:29:40] person
[1:29:41] listen this
[1:29:43] there's a white horse rider but what the
[1:29:45] mystery of it is there's a mystery that
[1:29:47] goes with that writer
[1:29:50] there's a mystery that goes with these
[1:29:53] virtues
[1:29:55] it's not living a virgin life
[1:29:57] yet that's good
[1:29:59] is having power over the devil is having
[1:30:02] power over this world is having power
[1:30:05] over false Doctrine having power over
[1:30:08] somebody trying to change your idea of
[1:30:10] what's going on trying to make you
[1:30:11] believe that brother Brown wasn't the
[1:30:12] prophet trying to get you to believe
[1:30:14] that you can sit home and listen to
[1:30:15] tapes and make it
[1:30:17] I doubt that very seriously
[1:30:19] but what we're talking about by the way
[1:30:20] full Redemption so who are we redeeming
[1:30:23] we're redeeming this white righteous
[1:30:25] beautiful bride
[1:30:28] this wearing white
[1:30:31] that's in Revelations 19 that says his
[1:30:34] wife
[1:30:35] that's made herself ready
[1:30:37] and then they come down start riding on
[1:30:39] white horses
[1:30:41] much different than revelation 6. that's
[1:30:44] a tripper-upper brother Brown says
[1:30:46] that's the devil
[1:30:47] this is the true God with his bride
[1:30:50] listen proverbs 31 10. I want you to
[1:30:52] listen to this
[1:30:54] I want you to listen and know that we
[1:30:56] are we are
[1:30:58] come off of a human tree we are born in
[1:31:00] sin shaping and iniquity all right
[1:31:02] everybody with me we ought to know that
[1:31:03] in this church okay so let's don't put
[1:31:05] ourselves above anybody else let God put
[1:31:07] us up there everybody with me
[1:31:10] let God put us up there let him give us
[1:31:13] a position
[1:31:14] if we take our own position we're in
[1:31:17] trouble That's what Satan did right he
[1:31:19] took his own position Peter stayed in
[1:31:21] his own if he to stay in a position God
[1:31:22] give him
[1:31:23] he's been fine he said but iniquity was
[1:31:26] found in you buddy you want to be me and
[1:31:28] you can't be me
[1:31:29] because I'm the Creator and you're not
[1:31:32] proverbs 31 now watch this who wrote the
[1:31:35] Book of Proverbs
[1:31:38] Solomon
[1:31:40] who's his mother
[1:31:45] his mother was the girl that David
[1:31:48] defiled
[1:31:51] took her before she was
[1:31:54] hmm
[1:31:56] and then made his greatest General
[1:32:01] In the Heat of the battle
[1:32:04] put
[1:32:06] him right in the middle of it
[1:32:09] and said withdraw
[1:32:11] I want him dead
[1:32:15] and you know for Bathsheba
[1:32:17] and her husband
[1:32:21] to be that close to the Palace
[1:32:24] he had to be because remember he was a
[1:32:26] gentile
[1:32:28] so was she
[1:32:31] hmm right
[1:32:34] he was a hittite
[1:32:35] right he wasn't a Jew but to be that
[1:32:38] close to the castle for David to look
[1:32:40] down and and see her on the top of the
[1:32:42] roof and she wasn't up there to show him
[1:32:44] off she went up there seductively she
[1:32:46] didn't have nothing she didn't have a
[1:32:47] clue what was going on because remember
[1:32:49] God didn't blame Bathsheba for anything
[1:32:52] he blamed David
[1:32:54] everybody with me
[1:32:56] but for Solomon to say who can find a
[1:33:00] virtuous woman
[1:33:01] for her prices far above rubies knowing
[1:33:04] that he that his mother was defiled
[1:33:07] by King David
[1:33:09] and then he married her and then Solomon
[1:33:12] came
[1:33:13] now watch Proverbs 12 verse 4 a virtuous
[1:33:16] woman is a crown to her husband
[1:33:19] but she that maketh ashamed is
[1:33:20] rottenness in his bones you would you
[1:33:22] would say okay let's take Rahab and
[1:33:24] she's she was rotten to to what was his
[1:33:26] name Uriah
[1:33:27] Iran the hittite
[1:33:30] no she was a virtuous woman
[1:33:33] David's one that had a problem
[1:33:36] like I said before sometimes we look at
[1:33:37] these things and we think man it's all
[1:33:39] bathsheba's fault
[1:33:42] no
[1:33:44] David's fault
[1:33:46] David committed adultery
[1:33:50] he asserted himself as king over
[1:33:52] Bathsheba and he took her
[1:33:54] probably against her will
[1:33:56] but he was the king
[1:33:57] and you refuse a king guess what you die
[1:34:01] she knew that
[1:34:03] and God didn't send Nathan to Bathsheba
[1:34:10] he didn't come to curse us
[1:34:15] he didn't do that
[1:34:17] he cursed David
[1:34:20] remember the story
[1:34:22] Nathan said
[1:34:23] there was this man that had a thousand
[1:34:25] sheep
[1:34:27] and he had this visitor coming in
[1:34:30] and he had one little guy that had a
[1:34:32] little you lamb a woman
[1:34:33] Jews are women right girls had this
[1:34:37] little you lamb and only had one
[1:34:39] and that man takes that one lamb and
[1:34:43] kills it
[1:34:44] for his visitor
[1:34:46] I'm sure David stood up and he took that
[1:34:48] Sepulcher and he banged it on the on the
[1:34:50] pulpit hello somebody he banged it on
[1:34:53] the pulpit and said the man ought to die
[1:34:57] kill that person bring him here and I'll
[1:35:00] chop his head off
[1:35:01] Nathan looked at him and said David
[1:35:04] you're the man
[1:35:10] but he said one thing
[1:35:12] that saved David's life
[1:35:14] he said but David I prayed for you
[1:35:18] he had a prophet we had a Prophet come
[1:35:21] in and tell us the same thing
[1:35:24] told us the exact same story
[1:35:26] in his sermon it was in the exact same
[1:35:29] story it was not bathsheba's fault it
[1:35:33] was David's fault
[1:35:35] right here
[1:35:36] man sometimes we look at things a little
[1:35:39] bit different
[1:35:40] because David was a murderer
[1:35:42] premeditated if he had to go to court
[1:35:44] they would have took his life
[1:35:46] he premeditated that murder he didn't
[1:35:48] murder him out of anger or out of out of
[1:35:51] passion he knew what he was doing he
[1:35:53] calculated exactly when your eye was
[1:35:55] going to battle and he said all right
[1:36:00] put him in the heat
[1:36:01] and withdraw yourself whoever was joab
[1:36:04] or somebody joab remembered that
[1:36:07] because later on in the scriptures he
[1:36:09] tells David he said I've done I've done
[1:36:11] done this for you one time I don't think
[1:36:13] I'm gonna do it again
[1:36:14] but you see you understand what the
[1:36:15] devil does though the devil makes
[1:36:17] everything look Soul it's always the
[1:36:18] woman's fault but why does God use these
[1:36:21] women
[1:36:22] why did God why does now God used one
[1:36:24] virgin girl
[1:36:26] to produce his body
[1:36:28] but all these other people look at this
[1:36:30] right here
[1:36:31] Rahab
[1:36:33] she's a prostitute
[1:36:36] she was a gentile
[1:36:38] she was me and you
[1:36:40] brother Brown said the type of the
[1:36:42] believer
[1:36:43] that believed without sin
[1:36:45] but she marries salmon not Salman she
[1:36:48] married Salman which is an Israeli
[1:36:49] General after they destroyed the city of
[1:36:52] Jericho he says who are you she says
[1:36:56] well I'm Rahab she didn't say harlot
[1:36:58] she said I'm Rahab
[1:37:00] because remember everybody in the city
[1:37:02] died
[1:37:03] so her accusers were dead
[1:37:05] all those men she'd been with are all
[1:37:07] gone boy talk about Grace
[1:37:10] but now remember it really did happen
[1:37:12] she was a prostitute
[1:37:15] come on somebody you're not getting this
[1:37:18] she was a prostitute but by being
[1:37:22] obedient to the word of God and hanging
[1:37:25] that red rope she saved herself and her
[1:37:28] family
[1:37:29] but she was still a prostitute
[1:37:33] but Salman said hey
[1:37:36] you're beautiful
[1:37:37] I love you let's get married
[1:37:40] and guess who came out of that
[1:37:45] Boaz
[1:37:46] type of Christ
[1:37:48] comes out of a prostitute and an Israeli
[1:37:51] General
[1:37:52] God's only got a little sense of humor
[1:37:54] doesn't he but that types me and you
[1:37:56] that's where we came from
[1:37:59] now look Ruth
[1:38:01] now you got Boaz Mary and Ruth and here
[1:38:03] comes Obed well now Russell's not a
[1:38:05] virgin when she married her husband was
[1:38:07] dead but she wasn't a true virgin when
[1:38:09] Boaz married her
[1:38:11] Boaz knew that
[1:38:15] David
[1:38:16] took Bathsheba
[1:38:18] and there's Solomon
[1:38:21] that whole line looked like it was
[1:38:23] messed up
[1:38:24] in our eyes
[1:38:27] but in God's eyes
[1:38:29] that's the way he wanted it
[1:38:31] that's the way he wanted all this to
[1:38:33] come that's the way he wanted us to come
[1:38:34] up this statue of a perfect man he used
[1:38:37] all of our imperfections and all of our
[1:38:39] junk and all of our
[1:38:41] inadequacies
[1:38:44] he used every bit of that to make us a
[1:38:46] virtuous woman
[1:38:48] after we get born again listen to this
[1:38:50] right here I want you to listen to this
[1:38:52] I'm gonna skip through that in the
[1:38:54] adoption series I pulled this up just a
[1:38:55] few minutes ago
[1:38:56] listen to this we'll close right here
[1:38:59] predestination looks back to
[1:39:00] foreknowledge I mean election the
[1:39:02] election looks back
[1:39:04] to foreknowledge now what is election
[1:39:06] election is what
[1:39:08] voting
[1:39:10] all right as brother Brown says and I've
[1:39:11] always said you got one vote on your
[1:39:13] side God's got one vote on his I mean
[1:39:15] the devil's got one vote on his side
[1:39:17] God's got one vote on this side you're
[1:39:20] the vote swinger
[1:39:21] you're going to either vote for the
[1:39:22] devil's side it'd be two to one or vice
[1:39:24] versa all right everybody with me choice
[1:39:26] you still have something to do with even
[1:39:28] elections so somebody people preach
[1:39:30] election and predestination like you
[1:39:31] didn't have a choice
[1:39:32] oh I see nothing but Choice election is
[1:39:36] what you're gonna vote
[1:39:38] you're gonna swing the boat one way or
[1:39:40] the other
[1:39:42] election looks what back to
[1:39:44] foreknowledge and predestination looks
[1:39:48] to Destiny
[1:39:50] all right for knowledge knows what your
[1:39:53] destiny is you don't
[1:39:55] now watch don't forget that election
[1:39:58] looks back here look
[1:40:00] everybody says you want to be born with
[1:40:02] this certain thing in you and listen to
[1:40:04] this
[1:40:05] I was a kookaburra
[1:40:08] I was born in sin
[1:40:10] shaping an iniquity come to the world
[1:40:13] speaking lies
[1:40:14] born amongst sinners
[1:40:17] father and mother and all my whole
[1:40:20] family Sinners that was probably rough
[1:40:22] for a prophet to say but he was honest
[1:40:25] I was a kookabur
[1:40:28] but all of a sudden
[1:40:30] I became a wheat germ or wheat grain how
[1:40:34] did it happen
[1:40:36] that's what it is folks election God
[1:40:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:40] elected that the Kookaburra was to
[1:40:44] become a grain of wheat
[1:40:46] he knew what you would accept
[1:40:48] now I know I'm a grain of wheat because
[1:40:50] I'm saved
[1:40:52] how do I do it
[1:40:53] look back and see that his predestinated
[1:40:56] that he predestinated it a long time ago
[1:40:59] by foreknowledge he's seen that I would
[1:41:02] love him by foreknowledge he saw that I
[1:41:04] would love him and therefore had it
[1:41:06] ready for me when I wanted it right
[1:41:09] so he what he made a perpetuation
[1:41:12] through his own son that through him I
[1:41:14] might become from a kuckleber to a grain
[1:41:17] of weed how do you change a couple bird
[1:41:18] to a grain of wheat you take the life of
[1:41:20] the Kookaburra out and you put the grain
[1:41:22] of wheat in you may still look like a
[1:41:24] cuckoo bird but if you get planted you
[1:41:26] got wheat germ life in you you're gonna
[1:41:28] bring a wheat plant up everybody with me
[1:41:30] say Amen
[1:41:31] now where am I at now I'm saved I'm
[1:41:34] walking in the grace of God I'm Rahab
[1:41:39] but I've been taken by a general
[1:41:43] he took on my shame in my sin
[1:41:47] I'm walking in the grace of God what
[1:41:49] does predestination look to Destiny
[1:41:51] where will he take me to and where am I
[1:41:54] going that's gotcha there you are it's

[1:43:24] cover that
[1:43:25] you are the pure
[1:43:29] virtuous boy how did you how'd that
[1:43:32] happen
[1:43:33] I thought I just said we were a bunch of
[1:43:35] prostitutes
[1:43:36] according to the word of God
[1:43:41] we got his life in US
[1:43:44] and we're walking up that statue of
[1:43:46] perfect man with his life in US
[1:43:48] portraying and projecting
[1:43:50] this pure virtuous sinless Bride of the
[1:43:55] son of the Living God
[1:43:57] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:43:59] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:44:01] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:44:03] God stands as though you never sinned at
[1:44:06] the first place
[1:44:07] you are perfect the blood of Jesus
[1:44:09] Christ
[1:44:10] Revelations 19 7 so let us be glad and
[1:44:13] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:44:14] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:44:16] wife
[1:44:17] hath made herself ready and to her it
[1:44:19] was granted that she should be arrayed
[1:44:21] in fine linen clean and white
[1:44:24] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:44:27] of you
[1:44:30] can I say that are you not a saint you
[1:44:33] should be you're either a saint or a
[1:44:35] hate that's what brother Brown said for
[1:44:37] the fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:44:38] you
[1:44:41] who wants to accept that
[1:44:43] we've got to be able to accept that we
[1:44:45] got to be able to accept that Rahab
[1:44:46] listen Rahab and all that she was she
[1:44:50] knew she was a prostitute to begin with
[1:44:52] she could not take that out of her mind
[1:44:54] but somewhere down the line there had to
[1:44:57] be a transforming power of God to
[1:45:00] transfer her into not being a prostitute
[1:45:02] no more because listen there wasn't a
[1:45:04] new birth back then
[1:45:06] it wasn't a new birth to change her
[1:45:08] there had to be something come upon her
[1:45:15] I believe her husband
[1:45:16] had a lot to do with it
[1:45:18] this Israeli General that knew Jehovah
[1:45:22] knew God
[1:45:24] knew the ways of of of the Jews and and
[1:45:28] the promises of God
[1:45:30] he started telling them to her
[1:45:33] hey
[1:45:34] I know you're Gentile
[1:45:37] but I've took you for mine
[1:45:41] in other words I've took your shame
[1:45:44] and now what Jesus did for us
[1:45:46] I'm going to take your shame I know
[1:45:48] you've been a prostitute
[1:45:50] but I'm going to take your shame on me
[1:45:52] and guess what we're going to live
[1:45:53] happily ever after
[1:45:55] we're going to have a Boaz
[1:45:58] and that Boaz is going to have an Obed
[1:46:01] and that old bed is going to have a
[1:46:02] Jesse that Jesse's gonna have a David
[1:46:05] and that David's going to have a Solomon
[1:46:08] and that Solomon is going to have on
[1:46:09] Down the Line till we come to Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ I actually to come to Joseph
[1:46:15] that line that we looked like we would
[1:46:18] never Brother Gary we'd never draw that
[1:46:19] picture
[1:46:21] too much prostitution going on in that
[1:46:23] too much too much work too much too much
[1:46:26] filth as the world would see
[1:46:30] what does God see
[1:46:33] all salmon saw was when he looked down
[1:46:36] through there and saw everything
[1:46:38] destroyed
[1:46:40] except one little stick of a building
[1:46:41] standing up
[1:46:43] with a red
[1:46:45] Scarlet rope
[1:46:49] he says that where you live
[1:46:51] she said yeah that's where I live she
[1:46:52] said he said oh you must be Rahab we
[1:46:54] heard about you you helped our spies
[1:46:56] you're so pretty
[1:47:00] what do you do for a living
[1:47:05] he knows all our faults and failures
[1:47:07] he knows what we did
[1:47:09] but he's come though to give us look if
[1:47:12] you believe what the word says that
[1:47:13] you've become the virtue of sinless
[1:47:15] pride of Jesus Christ you got to
[1:47:16] overcome all that
[1:47:18] you got to overcome all that Rahab
[1:47:20] business all that all that Bathsheba
[1:47:22] business all that uh woman at the well
[1:47:24] business
[1:47:25] looks like she was just not even I mean
[1:47:28] who'da went and talked to her even the
[1:47:30] disciples are like why is he talking to
[1:47:32] her
[1:47:33] why is he over there remember he sent
[1:47:36] him in another direction to get them
[1:47:37] naysayers and doubters out of the way
[1:47:39] come on somebody so he could talk talk
[1:47:42] to her one-on-one
[1:47:44] and not have Peter going why is he doing
[1:47:46] that
[1:47:48] why is he doing this why is he doing
[1:47:49] that then you got Judas going well
[1:47:52] he shouldn't be standing over that close
[1:47:54] to her
[1:47:55] right so he got rid of all them he said
[1:47:58] hey y'all go buy food
[1:47:59] I gotta go I need to go buy some area
[1:48:04] brother John there was a poll going on
[1:48:07] in Us in another round that nobody saw
[1:48:09] but Jesus and that woman
[1:48:12] she needed
[1:48:14] a savior
[1:48:16] and Buddy when they met
[1:48:19] she throwed that pot down she ran back
[1:48:20] and I don't believe she went back to
[1:48:23] that number six guy
[1:48:26] I don't believe that I believe she said
[1:48:29] hey come see a man
[1:48:31] that's what she needed she needed number
[1:48:33] seven and she got him
[1:48:35] hey man she got number seven which was
[1:48:38] the Lord Jesus and she didn't need
[1:48:39] anything else and she was what
[1:48:42] she's going to be counted as a bride
[1:48:45] she went to the upper room got the Holy
[1:48:46] Ghost she's going to be counted as
[1:48:47] bright and you're going to go weren't
[1:48:49] you the
[1:48:51] no I don't remember what were you
[1:48:54] because we can't remember that part of
[1:48:55] our past remember
[1:49:00] Salman's wife
[1:49:01] that brought forth Boaz one of the
[1:49:03] greatest men in the Bible that actually
[1:49:05] typed in every way Jesus Christ
[1:49:11] our Kinsmen Redeemer he acted our
[1:49:13] Kinsmen through Boaz that came from
[1:49:17] Rahab the Harlot
[1:49:19] what a mighty God we serve
[1:49:21] What a Mighty God that can that can
[1:49:23] absolutely forget what we were
[1:49:27] hey man we've just got to learn
[1:49:30] to do like he and forget that
[1:49:34] because what's hindering us us
[1:49:38] in our past but I hope I want you to do
[1:49:41] this one this year I want us to fill it
[1:49:43] this year with so much good and so much
[1:49:45] positive I want us to fill it with so

[1:50:01] center
[1:50:02] and just let him work and then all those
[1:50:05] former things will pass away the Bible
