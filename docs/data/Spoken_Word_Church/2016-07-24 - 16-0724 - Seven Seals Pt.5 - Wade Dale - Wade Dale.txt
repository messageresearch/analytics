========================================

okay all right let's turn to Revelation 6 or you can just read it on the screen if you want to last Sunday's video got corrupted or encrypted or anyway it's in 513 somewhere so we're going to background just a little bit but we do have the audio for it so the audio is online not the video but what we've been talking about we're starting on a study on the seven seal and a few things that we've been talking about good to have a visitor with us today and U brother Joe's grandaughter and all the way walked all the way from California to get here not her first DED there okay all right so what we're talking about is the Seven Seals in the Bible now what did we say the seal was we've established that a seal is the Holy Ghost right you can't understand you can't understand the Bible which is the Mysteries that are contained in the Seven Seals it has to be in the Bible why I've got Bible written in red it always has to come out of the Bible okay so if the prophet got anything he had to get it out of the Bible if you and I get anything we got to get it out of the Bible uh so strange that people worry that we um follow a message of of of an individual well you know individuals all over uh Luther Wesley they don't talk about those people they started the movements and um and everybody talks about Billy Graham everybody talks about um met a man the other day that was a real staunch follower of of Jimmy Swagger well they have a Ministry they have a Ministry that people are that people flop to all right but never did never did a a a person have a message specifically where you can tie it back to the Bible like brother brand that message we can tie it back to the Bible so we're tying all these seals back to the Bible now before we get started I want you to realize one thing that there's only Seven Seals now when I went to the Philippines last year they had a doctrine that that uh you know the Bible says seven seals on the back side seal with Seven Seals he they said they 14 seals that brother R revealed seven and that we've got to reveal the other seven no such thing no type it's the same Seven Seals we just haven't understood it cuz I'm going to read you a quote in a few minutes that I think will really help us and get our mind to where we can get back to Revelation it's got to be revealed right okay it's got to be revealed it cannot be just probed that it's got to come straight from God and that Revelation comes straight from God so then we trying to back up a little bit from last Sunday so we took Revelations 5 which is what that's the breaking of the seal the lamb takes the book in his possession now if the lamb takes the book in his possession which is Jesus Christ and then you and I are heirs and Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ we get the same thing he gets right so what was he doing he was at he was he was receiving his body cuz we are the body of Christ the body of Believers you can't you know the head is the most important part of the body but without the body that is no good that's right I mean you can have a head rolling around all over the place full of brains and everything else but if you don't have a body to work through so and you say wellow God's nothing without us he said he was nothing without us I'm just telling you what he said what brother what did the Bible say Paul said without the body you know without the spiritual body you're dead all right and and we can be say wow no I'm alive no you can be the most dead person in the world and be alive that's right all these people that out here athletes and all these people that boy I'm just so alive and everything's they're As Dead As Dead could be without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without Jesus Christ in their life they are walking dead talking about zombies they're walking dead and but what the problem is they don't know it that's right that's the problem that's why I lay out of see it was blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it well how much more are they now blind miserable wretched naked and don't even know it it's like brother R said you see a woman walk down the street with no clothing you say ma'am you don't have any clothing you need to put clothes on what's it to you I've got clothes on well see she's so deceived and what do you think about now same thing with the women stripping their clothes on they don't think nothing about it no more even nominal Christians you know they just walk around with no clothes on so but anyway and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals now right here is where we're going from Revelations 5 Revelations 5 the prophet said was the most Sublime scripture in the Bible Why shows full Redemption when the lamb takes that book that's full Redemption the most important the most important scripture in the Bible is Daniel 9:24 what it positionally places us just like we showed in the Daniel 70 weeks it positionally places us where we are and I didn't start this thing so we won have any audio anyway we'll get together sometime but uh come on in come on in hey I knew you were coming before you got here the police told me the police told me good to have you with us that is brother Louis's older sister no can't you tell can't you tell can't you tell her name is Sandra yes that's that's that's his younger sister good to have you with us today okay now and you too CHR thank you thank you for bringing her thank you're welcome okay all right so now we were at Revelations 5 the breaking of the seal that Revelations 5 showed full Redemption when the lamb takes that book and it's in his possession now it is his it is his responsibility to break it and not to reveal anything but himself right right I mean that's what I'm saying about what dad's always said what I content you can't reveal the devil in the spiritual Revelation right you can't right you can't reveal the devil as you re as you reveal Jesus Christ you understand what I'm saying a personal relationship once God is revealed to you it's personal relationship Satan can't do that amen amen amen so what what we're dealing with now is is we're dealing with one thing I want to read you the quote before we get on through this let me read you this quote cuz it really helps me cuz look to be real plain and simple the seals have been opened mhm the lamb opened the book and through a prophet of God he delivered that to us in written form mhm you hear what I said yes I said in written form and anyone can read it that's right that's right but if you don't get a revelation the book's closed right I read a quote and I'll read it in a couple weeks I don't want to read it now but I'll I'll tease you with a little bit brother Brown said said Jesus close the book remember even in Luke in Luke 4 he revealed who he was and then what did he do the Bible said he shut the book up and handed it back to the priest well he shut the book up and it's only to be open in the end time but it's not supposed it's not it's not that God closed the Bible and then he's going to open this book over here no the Bible by the Bible become a brand new book to the prophet watch this quote right here take a moment on my slow iPad my slow iPad all right let's go to where I was looking at today this morning now brother briam is preaching on is this the sign of the end everybody see that yeah MH all right now the mystery here is the mystery a mystery is scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed everybody got that divinely reveal but which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation you say how in the world can that happen listen when I was 14 years old not bragging but when I was 14 years old I read the prophet's message I knew there was only one God and that Jesus was his name I knew there was no eternal hell I could see it in the Bible but I was as lost as a as a as a blind man I was lost I wasn't born again I was lost but I could understand by natural understanding I could understand what brother Randon was talking about that's why the Bible says that the most illiterate person can be able to understand that M right and I had no but see but now watch you say well the water baptism been revealed to me most like brother Dale says he said if one God is revealed to you then you have to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right people say oh I know what one there only one God but I'm going to keep my father son Holy Ghost B no yet this hadn't really been revealed what happened there's a supernatural element that hadn't been revealed to you yet mhm there's something that hadn't been made known to you now you reason I'm reading this let me read it one more time the Mysteries here is the mystery now he's he's going to Revelations 10:7 cuz there's only one mystery right the Mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is scripture go right here he talk Jesus told him said right here because it's given to you because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not not to them but to them it is not given the mystery now watch what he says here is the mystery he breaks it down to the mystery the mystery is scripture so every mystery is to be revealed according to scripture MH Eat My Flesh and drink my blood that's written down on a piece of paper that's the Eternal Word of God now you take a slant on that and we got to find the body of Jesus and start eating it and we got to find the blood and start drinking it or we're not in the Bible if that's your Revelation but there's a mystery behind that revelation of taking of the communion that Paul came and instituted later and showing what there was a divinely revealed truth of that scripture Eat My Flesh and drink my blood cuz remember when we get into Matthew 24:24 or Matthew 24 and we start looking at the seals you're going to wonder well that happened so many years ago remember this is this is what I see God gives somebody a vision they write it down like John he gave John a vision of all that in Revelations right all this we're going to read well John writes it down now he sees it in a vision a television he sees it in a vision m M cuz remember I want you to understand something John was commissioned to write what he saw that's right right you know so he saw something it wasn't just a figment of his imagination right this comes straight from the mind of God that had already happened in the mind of God everybody all right with that you got to go with me here you got to go way back way back and find where this Revelation come from that's right Revelation come right straight from God John you just write it on a piece of paper and send it to the churches so John writes what he saw mystery biing mystery you've seen many mysteries in Revelation John no doubt when he come back from patmas under the anointing of the Holy Ghost he probably understood some of those things but some of those things were sealed up just like they were for Daniel they were sealed up until the end but now remember John writes it and then it doesn't start coming to pass till you know some of it till 1500 years later some of it till now 2,000 years later John wrote it in the ad6 ad90 so you know we're almost at 2,000 years before it actually happened so let's bring it over here to where the two prophets we just covered D in 70 weeks the two prophets the two witnesses John saw those two witnesses wrote it down now it's going to be almost 2,000 years before they come on the scene but you and I are not going to even be here to see that that's right you see what I'm talking about there's layer upon layer of things but now you and I get the divinely revealed Supernatural element of those two witnesses We Know by Revelation that they're Moses and Eli the spirit of Moses and Elijah on two men they got to be Jews and the Bible obviously tells us they got 1260 days to do their job right and that it will be the basis of this message this Revelation is what goes to them so there's a divinely revealed truth that has a supernatural element that is going to naturally happen right but we see it supernaturally we back up and look at it and we say hey that's what's going to happen I was thinking the other day I thought you know Martin Luther I doubt this is my this is I'm going out on a limb here Martin Luther never in his life sat down and I don't believe God revealed to him that he was the fifth Church a messenger it took brother brandom to know who them seven Messengers were I'm sure Paul you know he was kind of on the foundation so he said everything's going to be based on me I'm sure that God told him said look Paul everything's going to be based because Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel if a man come from heaven and bring any other thing well see nobody else has come through in a commentary in scripture except Paul see irenius is not in the Bible that's right right there was no Bible when irus was here right there was no Bible when Martin was here what you hear what I'm saying you got to imagine that one day that that just take all our Bibles away all we have to go by on is what somebody else said there was no television there was no they couldn't text each other and say how y'all doing no irenius stood out on the word of God that he heard right now who gets the supernatural element of that though we do we get the Supernatural part that he naturally saw he was on Earth I don't believe Iranian stood up one day and said I'm the second Church age messenger no but he had a message from God he delivered that message and like brother Dale said and many I want you to see just see this but I took and got all the U all the deaths of the of the church age messenger but now remember if the messenger comes at the end of the age he can't go too far into his age because he cometh the end of the previous age right right and you're going to see that this will help you with the seals because they all overlap and tie together there's a supernatural element in these seals that's what I'm trying to get to Revelation 61 was a scene in heaven right that scene come to a man named William brandham and he opened and and cracked open that seal all right but there's a supernatural element behind that right because see Clarence Lin and some of those other oldtimers they brought the the Holy Ghost was not the white horse rider they said he knew it was the Antichrist mhm but he didn't have a message behind it right there wasn't a fully revealed message there was Loose Ends remember me preaching on that not there was loose ends that that that even even the old other Church age Messengers had except Paul in the first few but now Martin Luther strict trinitarian you couldn't sit down and talk to him about Jesus Christ baptism you could now but you can't couldn't be in cuz it wasn't revealed to it but Paul the the the messenger comes at the end of the AG so at the end of Pentecost 53 ad is when it started 170 is when it ended Paul died in 67 ad so he died at the end of the Pentecostal Church age right or Pentecostal age all right irenius the message started at in 170 to 312 he died in 202 he lived 30 years if you'll notice and I'm not to go through all of them you can look them up yourself Google [Music] it or Wikipedia but watch all these Messengers come at the end of the age as they matured out of one age into another except for Columba now I don't understand but Columba died six he died nine years before the church age started but his influence right coming out of this age of Martin to Columba his influence began in Martin's Church age Paul's influence began in the Pentecostal Church age or the Pentecostal age we don't call it a church age but the Pentecostal age Paul's influence I was reading and if you look in the book of Acts Paul began about ad 3435 few years after Jesus died he began to start his ministry well well he died in ' 67 the church age started in 53 ad so you see what I'm saying see where that overlap comes in Paul comes at the end of the age all the messengers come at the End of the Age they feel what's going on in that age they grew up in that age is what I'm talking about that naturally that's going to do spiritually naturally they grew up they were born in the church age previous they grew up and right if you'll notice every one of these even brother brand there was about 40 years that they overlap well that's the 40 Years of of our life and and most of them died in their 70s and 80s so they were mature 40y old men when they began to bring their message right their message only went about 40 years they died but now the ministry of those that's my point now the ministry of William brandom didn't stop in' 65 when he died it continues on right and it's on now you see what I'm saying that's what happened back here that's why I see that's not a mystery anymore right it's not a mystery how that a messenger can come at the End of the Age bring his message go off the scene and then a bunch of people pick it up and carry that characteristic of that church age carried on until somebody like Luther he died in 1566 the start his church AE started 1520 so he had 46 years to preach his message get people to believe it and see it and then God took him off the scene and he went on and carried on same things happened in now brother Brandon brought the message brought us a divinely revealed truth but now there's a supernatural element on top of that that we have to get you don't [Music] listen the years that they were born you'll get it I mean really if you'll understand it is a real it it'll help you to understand how God works cuz God never changes his pattern his pattern continues on it's the message that does the word not the that's correct the word that bring the man has to be off the scene before the message can take effect you say oh no Jesus's message was not effective at all except for the healings and the things I'm talking about his message the revelation of who he was was not revealed until he died and went off the S that's right amen amen God himself so if that's the pattern then that's the pattern we got to go by that's why I said brother Rand might could have took a Rapture just today one problem us that's right we were not there some of y'all weren't even born in 1965 most of you were not born in 1965 how many of you were born after 1965 half of you so you're the reason he had to go off the sink no we are really I mean it had to be a p but still saying it had to be a pattern God couldn't do one more for one than he did for another so he took the pattern brought the message brought the messenger at the end of the Pentecostal age and even right here you'll read on down where all these Mysteries I'm not going to read them but you know the Bible lists these like 12 mysteries in the Bible all right and he list them all here and is this the sign of the end sir now remember one that message preached it was preached in December the 30th 1962 well the seals what brother Ram's doing now he's leaving them and go into Arizona to get the revelation of the seals and March and come back and start preaching so he's he's two months away he knows something's coming cuz he's a prophet but he keeps telling them he keeps telling them you right here that's some of the Mysteries that this Angel he's talking about the seventh angel coming supposed to wind up all the Mysteries may I say this with reverence but referring to the angel of God serpent seed now see the serpent seed if you'll just sit down and and take common sense right and know that an apple could not have caused a fall of mankind okay and then now that pattern has to continue down but listen there's more to serpent seed than just that there was sex in the garden I mean we're all adults here we're having still having T I mean you understand what I'm saying it didn't do away with anything that's right and it didn't explode anything it was the program God had so the serpent SE now we realize that yes it was a natural act but what happened brother Brandon backs us up and said eve had to put it in her mind first right right cuz you get a revelation and you go you get you get that you know you see that it was a relationship between Eve and the Beast which was was the missing link that everybody's looking for that God did away with that but you look and you go back and and brother R takes us all the way back to not just the natural act he takes us back to where Eve gets a revelation her own Revelation and that's what caused it right not that this caused it this was just an effect right James covers it real well I may go back and and preach that again cuz I enjoyed it where lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished it brings forth death you say well lust is bad lust is bad but if you cut it off before it continues on but if you don't when lust is conceived it brings forth sin the product right and when that product is finished it brings forth death so those four things you got your four horse riders you got your four um combat Beast you got your four Lineo man an eagle that brings everything back so you see that four is not a bad number when you use it in the right way then he talks about an eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal that's common sense you just have to look at somebody say look Jesus God's the only one that has eternal life right if you're going to burn in an eternal hell God's going to have to be down there with you that's to me that you just look at that and you go man how do people you know what it's old tradition right old tradition that oh you're going to burn in hell eternally that's right right now there is an eternal separation yes cuz once you get separated from God and you don't reconcile and come back then you're eternally separated there's no way for you to come back and that's for an eternity cuz it's it's done right but you're not going to live for an eternity and and and burnning hell you it's going to be you're just going to go away that's right all right now watch this right here the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did got it the mystery of baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation he's talking to Pentecostal people he's telling them that the Revelation is right there without a sensation that's right the mystery of water [Music] baptism let me there was one down here oh now watch right here let's get to this cuz this is what this is what happens when a messenger brings a message the sounding of the trumpet means a gospel trumpet and the sounding of a trumpet in the Bible means get ready for scriptural War are you getting it down scriptural War Paul said you going put it down 1 Corinthians if the trumpet give an uncertain sound how will a man know what to prepare for if it doesn't have a scriptural sound a Vindicated the Vindication of the word of God made manifest how will we know we're at the end time all right then it keep coming on down pay attention to that right here notice each Church age had its messenger we know that Paul was the first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded and the first seal was torn loose cuz the seals kind of go with the with the church anges all right I said kind of you can't they parallel they don't exact match everybody got that M cuz if the Rapture takes place on the force field you don't have the bride here in 5 six and seven so you understand what I'm saying all right Paul was the first Messenger as we found and what did he do declared war on what the old Pentecostal Orthodox church church behind right we not believing the Messianic sign that Jesus had produced to them while they should have not it remember Paul come at the End of the Age all the messengers come at the end of the age is at the end time when these things are brought forth what it's in the end time of the previous message okay they had lap overs but we don't have lap overs right we're going up right now God's going to laugh it over to the three and A2 years to the Jews but we're going to come back in a millennium and we're going to carry this thing all all the way through Paul knowing the scriptures know Jesus was the Messiah he blasted those synagogues from place to place with the scripture and was put out of every one of them now what's he doing he's telling them about himself he's telling about himself right Paul's bringing a message calls a scriptural a war brother Bram brings a message first part of his message was healing signs and wonders 50,000 100,000 200,000 people and then when he really began to with the scripture he was put out of every one of them brother B standing in 1962 he went to Arizona and nobody's invited him to preach and it gets worse as the seals opens it just gets worse and worse and worse right till finally he shook the dust off his feet turned to the Gentiles what was it sounding of a trumpet an angel messenger standing there with the word oh my don't you miss that now the word and Paul with the unadulterated interpretation of God's word blasted every one of them synagogues cost him his life how we could go down to irenius the one the messenger of the next Church AG St Martin began to get the doctrine of nians and they blasted that AG St Martin Luther he jumps over to Luther the fifth messenger he blasted the Catholic church with the word of God the just shall live by faith this is not the literal Body of Christ and he throw the communion on the floor and walked out and blasted the Catholic church that trumpet sounded right John Wesley raised up days of the angan church well there's no more reason to have revivals and it went to see but John Wesley stood up with the message of the second work of Grace and he blasted the anglian church with the gospel trumpet prepared for war that's right he did it now watch this now we're in the loud C and AG when they again denominated method Baptist prian Luther and Pentecostal and were looking for a prophet to come to blast this age and turn them back from their iniquity now if that's been the trend pattern yeah all the way down Through the Ages will God change his Trend in this day congregation says no he can't change it he has to keep the regular stride and remember this messenger was the seventh angel and he was to take all the Mysteries and gather them together notice the seventh angel was to blast the loud see it this what Brother D been talking about he hadn't used this scripture but he blast the L out of sins what he's blasting the Pentecost all right Rich Church rich increas with Goods have need of nothing he said you're miserable reged poor blind naked don't know it that was his message oh God send us to Fearless Prophet when thus sayith the Lord that the Vindicated word will move through and prove that he sent from God and when he comes he'll blast them ages sure will he'll set that Ley and church against him they were already starting to be against right all right now notice the L chch the Messenger will finish of the layout of sins the seventh angel will finish all the Mysteries that's been lost in the battles before for the truth so you see what's coming to look right here then comes the church age with the baptism of the spirit he's talking about Pentecost not what brother ding about but they messed it up and went right back into formalism like they did the first time all right right then he keep talking about the candlesticks L of sins came BR right the same mess it did in the first place don't you see what I mean there was a lot of truth lost but this seventh angel don't compromise on nothing he gathers up all the Loose Ends gathers them all up and at his sounding all the mystery he went back to one all the mystery of God should be finished all right oh God send him we know he was standing there but remember no one was getting this message that really carried it on to the coming of the Lord right now today 50 years later there was sure there was people that got a revelation do you hear what I'm saying there's people that got a revelation they came out like brother Joe Green's father they asked brother Joe Green's father they said brother Henry why did Brother brandham come to a little old town called spendel North Carolina to hold a series of meetings and brother Henry said to get me to get me cuz it brought the message to Northern of Western North Carolina through brother Joe Green's father brother Henry green well brother Henry green wasn't really a sponsor of the meeting but he was after the meeting well then brother rown goes off the scene well who carries his message brother Henry green brother Carol some of the old old ones that were back in you know you don't know who was sitting in the congregation of all those messages he preached and somebody caught one or two Revelations right all right but now listen that carried them to their death natural not spiritually they were spiritually they were alive for the message they had but they're naturally they naturally gone on brother Henry some of the ones Henry green and some of the older ones the old Fighters that come out of Pentecost and really did get a a revelation of the message but they didn't get the supernatural element they got part of the mystery they didn't get all of it you and I when we start into these the this is supposed to be the ending up the culmination the supernatural element of everything that God said from the foundation of the world to today that's why brother R said he never worked in a more spiritual Supernatural realm than the seals open he come out and preach one seal go back home get the second one come back out and preach I mean you know seven days yeah eight sermons um Counting the questions and answers then going back further to the to the breach but you see what I'm talking about if these are hidden mysteries the man will have to be a prophet yes because the word only comes to a prophet all right so the prophet but the prophet brings the message right brother brandham said that the that the people in Israel they became at ease that's what we've been talking about you know locally us been talking about the squeeze and things like that Moses the messenger walks on the scene and stirs up pharaoh and says Let My People Go I reading it yesterday Pharaoh turns right around and says go back down there and tell them we're not even giving them any straw anymore and they've got to double produce what they produced before right persecution then they cried for a deliverer well the deliverer was was already in their midst right but now remember Moses didn't carry them over who was the deliverer in the midst the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ in spirit form in the Holy the form of the Holy Ghost was in Moses but he had to get into the people yes right we don't know we know it wasn't an indwelling but there had to be an anointing that look we're tired of this we need a deliverer to not only take us out brother randam took us out come out of here my people brother took us out of the denominational world but Joshua is the one that put us in the promised land right right amen which was what a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in all the Believers right you say how can it happen well John brother said John typed the entire bride he typed several million people with different characteristics in each Church age John typed that whole bride so God can type any way he wants to one person for a billion or a billion people for one that's right either way he wants to so what's he doing now to me I think he's bringing now the supernatural element yes that's been hidden for 50 years okay and I believe that people are beginning to catch on and and this thing's going to start coming more to a narrow to narrow narrow narrow okay so that's what we're going to talk about next next week we'll talk about the first seal what is the first seal we know it's a white horn Rider went out and that brother brandom showed that that was the Antichrist but there was something there's a supernatural element that goes with that cuz you can read it listen go read your first deal next Sun next week he tells you what the Antichrist is it's the white horse rider and he had a bow with no arrows he's giving you what the characteristic of who that person is but you got to remember one thing if he went out God's already went out with the message Satan is only topping back behind that's right so really honestly let me let me be honest with you let me be honest were you going to lie was it going to lie I me be honest with you there was a white horse rider wrote out in the first church and it was the Holy Ghost hello it was the Holy Ghost in the Believers the pure word was in Paul and that white horse rider went out but what do we see we see the opposition and that's what we've got to see is the opposition this way I see he's been hid behind God all along now what do you do God's riding off and then Satan I mean Jesus God brings a message and then God comes I God brings a message I'm he I'm singing the song and then Satan comes right behind it and perverts it just as soon as he brings a message say pervers it you got to remember that every time you have a revelation remember make sure from God make sure it TPS every scripture hurry up we got to go what does it mean the back side of the book we'll get into that later then not right now okay we got to go got to go got to go
