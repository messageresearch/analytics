holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen you want to see him today look into the word that's where you'll find him and if it's people the word in the people then look at the people that's right and that's where you'll find him I was speaking this morning the know the Bible said the world see me no more but you'll see me that's right now he's lying if if we can't see him right but by revelation we can see him or understand him and the world just cannot understand him we uh we had a good time this week in uh in Myrtle Beach and uh it's not like Port St Joe Nick it just ain't like Port St Joe but I tell you what we stayed on the 15th floor of a 6 about 600 unit place and we had we met no one no one in the uh elevator all right no one no no one rode up or down and um and we were actually feeling pretty good we was the youngest people we saw in that place even though I turned 57 on Thursday we were still the youngest ones in the whole place cuz um they were uh they were U no one there we had no weights in the restaurants some of you saw on Facebook Jun posted with the crab legs and all that was a that was a good birthday present so amen thank you all for your prayers thank you for your support and and for your uh kind words on my birthday and the ones that gave me things and and the ones of you that didn't um we'll remember that right sister Johnny this Johnny gave me a wonderful pen a few minutes ago but that's all right but uh good to be in the house of the Lord we had a good time this morning and uh brother Luis got speaking in tongues speaking he spoke in tongues the whole service but we had a good time and uh his mom and Dad are on their way so we're going to have to make and and his sis two sisters are on the way so uh if they come in a little bit later and Louise has to interpret he'll be speaking in tongues again but his mother and father needs interpretation so I'm just going to let him come up here and start interpreting if that's all right okay so because they don't uh speak very well English and that's okay we want them to hear what hear what the word of the Lord has to say so if you got your ibles let's turn to the Book of Matthew 26 we're going to continue our thought on barred womb to a barred tomb and you know last Sunday we spoke on word the word made dust or the word made flesh and um this is going to carry up a little higher as far as toward Jesus is already being glorified but I want to bring a point out and then we're going to back up and look at his life among the Pharisees and Sadducees because his life among the Pharisees and Sadducees is going to be pretty much exactly the way we're going to have the demons we're going to have to fight of the same ones he fought and if he can overcome them so can we because he already overcome him one time amen he overcame him in human flesh and if he's in you in human flesh he's got to overcome amen if we allow him to overcome he will overcome so uh we were you know we had to do the time share thing I just want to tell you a little something about that we um uh got down to to the guy giving his sales pitch you know and I told him I said um right at the end I just kind of jumped up and sat down on the countertop and made myself comfortable on one of them big uh rooms you know and you know me and I said look buddy he said well you can do this you can raffle it off for the church you know he was giving his sales pitch you can do this you I said look buddy I said let me tell you let me just be real Frank with you I said we don't mix bathe we don't wear bathing suits you'll never see us in the same area as as and I said it don't make us no better than anybody else it's just that we don't believe in those things so this is not this is not the environment that we want to be in we don't believe in these things we we don't we're not like you know 99.9% of the people that he talked to he would have a sales pitch to go back with what they would say you know he'd you'd say this he'd say this well buddy when I told him that you didn't tell you he just said all right come on let's go he's done he what's he going to say what's he going to I mean we're we're in the world and listen and I want to I want to apologize for all of you that like the Beats from Sister Lisa all the way to the front I will not ever say I don't like the beach again I don't like the beach with a bunch of people in it right but that it was really nice listen God made the place he the Creator made that for somebody to enjoy and I'm not going to say that I don't like Lisa said amen me me me me me y'all going to see Lisa and glory and oh she's going to have a little island and it's going to have sand and water all the way around and she's going to be doing this for about 10,000 years and then 10,000 more she going to be going back in this direction amen and that's all right but but forgive me for saying that and being derogatory toward the beach because God made the beach he made that beach for somebody to enjoy and I um I just don't like all the filth and junk that we didn't see right everything was fine everything was good and and and clear we could we could open the balcony and you could hear the waves coming in at night and it was nice we had had a good time and I apologize I'm not going to be derogatory toward the beach anymore I it's a place God made for somebody he just didn't make it all for me he made it for brother dick and sister Gail and sister Lisa and some of the others but that and that's fine so we should not we should watch what we say and that's what I need to do I need to watch kind of don't be derogatory toward uh where people go on vacation you go wherever you please but you can be you know in the world but not out the world we have to be I mean you can see as much at work as you do on the beach if you really want to see it that's right okay so so forgive me for that I we really had a super good time had a good birthday we um we just enjoyed oursel we took a nap when we wanted to take a nap we got up when we wanted to get up so but I was ready to get back home ain't no place like home anyway amen so let's go to Matthew 26 like I said Thank you some of you U supported us going and and and uh some had some good things to say about my birthday and I really appreciate it not not worthy of any of it but thank you for saying it Matthew 26 we're going to speak today on uh I was telling uh Louis I said you you'll get it this afternoon but uh Lord showed me something and and I about did one of them brother Brandon running around Tree fets in my living room when I saw this and and I hope you see it the same way that I saw it like brother brand said I hope I can give this in the same way it was given me cuz I want you to see that listen it's all in the word there is no extra word that's right it's all in the word so but there's layers that you'll sit there and read the thing and read it and read it and then all of a sudden you'll go well that's the only way it could happen that's right right so I had one of those aha moments yesterday in studying this is I want to bring it out is it's called right hand glorified body you say well that's kind of strange but you'll get it in a minute maybe all right Matthew 26 63 and let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we thank you today for the people you've give us to be around be friends with be fellow servants with be brothers and sisters in the Lord we pray now that you'd sanctify us for this journey bless this day keep us safe keep the devil away from us all the ones that are sick Lord we pray that right now that they would get better Lord that that Satan know that he's a defeated at Calvary and that you've overcome and now that you've made us Overcomers in you father forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make be the active participant in this service Lord take care of each one of us may the hearers hear May the seers see and the speaker speak but it not be anything but your word take care of us Lord bless us give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name amen Matthew 26:63 says but but Jesus held his peace now this is like I said this is toward the end of his ministry so they're uh they're getting ready to put him on the cross but watch what he says and the high priest answered and said unto him I adure Thee by the Living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the son of God now remember brother Bram said Jesus never said called himself Son of God what did he say he said thou said thou has said nevertheless I say unto you Hereafter now not today he was in a pretty pretty pretty pretty good pickle at that time he was getting ready to be crucified Hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven all right now you can be seated and we'll read the book of Mark the Mark has uh The Book of Mark pretty much has the same the same thing but I want you to see something why Jesus didn't say that at the beginning of his ministry he's saying it's toward the end of his ministry is that all right amen toward the end of his me Hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power so God has declared through the son of man that you're going to see him after that you're going to see him sitting what on the right hand of power not and I'll let I'll read to you what brother Brown said it's not a right hand it's power and authority all right but now watch Jesus he had to go through stages he didn't say this at the first of his ministry he never said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me until what till after even this but he's telling them Hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power coming in the Clouds Of Heaven now we know that being today he's really telling us about tell them about today amen coming in the Clouds Of Heaven all right now Mark 16 everybody reads mark 16 but watch and he said unto them go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hn them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover all right so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God everybody got that all right so now let's go to Matthew 28:18 through 20 now this is after what this is this is after the uh death burri and Resurrection this is the 30 40 days he's getting ready to leave all right and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach all na now why didn't he say he was going to do that why didn't he say he was going to do that cuz I mean if he had all power in Heaven and Earth given under me then I'm going to do it God don't God doesn't work that way he knew he was going up and he was coming back just about 50 days later or 10 days later I mean and he was going into a group of people and they were going to do this go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you right and lo I am with you all way even until the end of the world Amen now that was the word made dust but that word made dust had become glorified that word made flesh is now glorified flesh amen is that all right now he wasn't glorified flesh before he died right amen cuz that's why he said here after you'll see the son of man right sitting on the right hand of God coming in the Clouds Of Glory so you got that all right we got that part now what we want to do is we want to show you and and look at this it's really it's really neat how the book of Acts let's go to Acts chapter 7 verse 52 and then we'll read some quotes here in a minute but remember the right hand you never as far as I can see in the Bible you never see a scene of of of anyone standing on the right hand or sitting on the right hand of God it except after the death Buren resurrection and Ascension of Jesus oh sure they prophesied in the Old Testament we read it Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol but that's really that's not saying exactly what he said he said you will see the son of man sitting on the right hand of God with all power and authority all right so it's got to be connected some way I see with a glorified body to me really just y'all can go to sleep now the glorified body is the right hand of God yall ready to go home sir well you can go to sleep if you want to but that's what struck me but you're going to see that when we get over into the Book of Revelations we're going to see how that that just ties perfect with the bride I'd never seen it before till the other day and it's just a real simple scripture we read all the time which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted they have SL now who is this this is stepen the Bible says full of the Holy Ghost y'all come on in I don't see your daddy I see your mama this is Brother Louis's you you've met his his sisters but that's his mother coming in the back looks more like his sister looks more like his sister than does now his daddy looks like an older brother than than than the dad so bless luis's heart I told that brother I prayed for him big time that's all right so acts 7:52 this is Stephen we wait till your dad gets here okay which are the prophets now this is stepen he's preaching full of the Holy Ghost and brother brandham if you we'll read in a minute brother brandham says now this is not a prophet he's not even a preacher he was a deacon in the church what he said this is the Steven was a deacon in the church well the Deacon in the church is fixing to let these people have it cuz he was full of the Holy Ghost which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers W he's talking to the Baptists and methodists and Pentecostals hello it's exactly who he's talking to who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God right you notice he's standing okay brother Lis acts 7:55 amen so acts 7:55 he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfast saw all the glory of God Jesus standing on the right hand of God all right then and oh and 7:56 and said behold I see the heavens open now up here at the top it says he saw J and Jesus standing on the right hand of God you see that but now the Bible watch it comes down here to that next verse and identifies who the man is that's God in human flesh glorified okay and the son of man standing on the right hand of God and to Sav read and the rest of it we know what happened they killed him amen they stoned him and he fell asleep the prophet of God said he didn't even feel it amen so here we see the first martyr of of of the um of the church age or the age and when he's getting ready to die he sees Jesus glorified amen amen he sees Jesus in a glorified body and he's standing watch this let's go to the first quote this is from the infallibility of God's spoken word Chicago 1956 I'm going to read I'm going to read the first paragraph and then you read it little old Steven was dying Jesus had been glorified sitting up there at the right hand of the majesty and they began to beat him with stones and his head was being mashed in with stones Steven looked steadfast toward Heaven Jesus after he finished his work that's important after he finished his work had sat down at the right hand of God right but stepen he saw Heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God I guess the Savior must have stood up from his throne and give the Martyr a welcome in amen he saw the Everlasting Dominion of God above you know Steven was the first one to go into the sixth dimension as far as as far as the sixth Dimension we know John the Baptist John the Baptist and all those but Steven was the first one with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be martyred that you see this now watch number two I'm building up to something here the resurrection of Jesus Chicago 1956 cuz I want you to see something about what happened when Jesus went up to the right hand of the father there was something opened up amen there was something opened up so watch and God raised him up and put him so high above every Heaven seventh Dimension until he has to stoop over to look to Heaven that's what God did for him so if you want to be exalted humble yourself and if you exalt yourself you'll be brought down low go ahead and I think of him that when he had raised risen from the dead that morning that he was then had his own blood as high high priest and he went beyond the veils through every spear right Satan in times past had men blocked off from Heaven he could not get in contact with heaven but when Jesus took his blood the first Veil he rent was the veil of death and the veil of the Grave the veil of the temple then the veil of sickness the veil of fear and every Veil that there was and unveiled God to man went way in above the heavens of Heaven Was Seated on the right hand of God and sat down as a finished work that's right all above and there he opened up a channel that God used to come down through the corridors of heaven and talk to Mankind in the Garden of Eden that's why when we get into those Dimensions see I don't think there was any Dimensions until this until sin because Adam Adam Ruled the Earth with no limitation so he could travel like a thought there was no dimension for him to go in and out of but watch this and Satan by sin had blocked them but the Great high priest with his Anointed with his blood went through every Veil and ripped her open cleared out the sky again that God and man could be father and son and commune again with one another all the Patriots of the New Testament as they died for instance Steven when they were stoning him to death the veils were all open to his precious eyes filled with blood but he said as he knelt on the ground he said I see Heaven open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God so the word made flesh didn't come down here just to save our soul he opened every Veil all the way back up he brought the dimensions where we can understand and see God not just see him but understand him but we know that when Steven looked and saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God it probably wasn't going through his mind at the moment that that's a glorify that's the glorified man you see what I'm saying but he knew that he was his savior he called him Jesus he knew Jesus was there and then the Bible shows that the son of man standing at the right hand of the father so being that Jesus come to pick up a glor or pick up a human body d picking up that dust what he done though he opened everything back up as soon as he went back brother Larry when he went up he opened everything up that's why people if we don't understand this CU remember he got his glorified body here he got he didn't have to go to heaven to get body he got his glorified body right here whatever change he made it was changed right here amen so so and then he went there so there's no way that him being who he is could close anything up so now here we are in the end time we got to understand all this we got to understand where the connection is amen you love the Lord listen he died at Calvary he took away your sins but he absolutely put a claim on your body and he's got to do it he can't there's no other way around he's got to bring a glorified condition and the only way can do is through the word of God Amen we'll read a quote very last that if you're not in the word you amen you got to be in the word all the way amen amen all right now let's go to number three which is pal worm Locust caterpillar I'll read the whole thing the right hand of God where the Bible said I looked up and seen Jesus standing at the right hand of God Philip or Steven when he was stoned don't mean that God's got a right hand Jesus is standing up on top of her right hand it means that he's in the right hand of power and authority now watch what he goes to go ahead cuz brother Brandon brings the right hand of power and authority and then he reads the scripture all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me said Jesus he was in Authority amen amen all power in heaven Earth been given unto me God was in Christ the Bible said in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodle now if that happen to him that's got to happen to us amen not as one person anymore but as a bride amen amen and and I want you to see something when we get to it number four it's the rising of the sun talking about the quickening of the spirit let's read the red now let's notice what it did on Steven Steven was full of quickening power go ahead wasn't that right see he was full of quickening power it didn't make him scared he said you stiff necks and uncircumcised and heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so do you which one of the prophets that showed forth the coming of the just one didn't your father Stone oh my done something to him sure he was full of quickening power and they said we'll get rid of that guy and when he died they stoned him in his poor little head the stones beating against it like that he looked up and said I see the heavens open quickening power was working I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God that's what's quickening power done for Steven amen it opened up a way now as we look we know that he was looking in another dimension amen he was look in another dimension and by Revelation he knew he was going to that place amen amen but you have to remember though that that when he got there he didn't see Jesus according to brother brandham see Jesus either right he didn't see Jesus either he said where is Jesus he said he's a little higher he was in the seventh Dimension with that's why I tell you when we when we come to that condition listen seventh Dimension is the glorified body nobody's reached it but one person right but we're going to have to reach it down here that's what's got to bring that sixth Dimension here bring them it'll be an automatic process it's not something that we're going to have to go now let's get the sixth Dimension now let's get this no when that glorified condition comes into here it's got to bring the sixth Dimension with it not going to bring the fifth God's not there amen amen not going to bring that so look at what we as the bride are required in this end time but it's only going to come if we're in the word all the way amen amen I was telling them this morning you know you you got to be you got to be in the word all the way because the son of man was in the word all the way the son of man was the word so you and I got to be the same thing the word made flesh in this hour for the time that we're living amen amen think about that if that Dimension comes here and the sixth Dimension comes here Heaven's empty Heaven's empty Heaven is truly for a moment back on Earth again what a glorious time no wonder 30 40 days we're going to be able to do whatever we want to McDonald's will go out of business McDonald Walmart will go out of business we won't need it amen amen your daddy like that he smiling yeah he oh he's shaking his hand too that's good amen good to have them with us today really refreshing always to have new let's read something in the Bible and let's see how that even in the Bible if we look at it the way we're looking at it now that the right hand of God is is is a glorified body am right amen have you ever looked at it that way okay that's why we have to preach job 23 now here's job watch what's job looking for he's looking for a redeemer right right he's looking for someone to do something right now watch job 238 behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him He hi hideth himself he hideth himself may I say in Revelation on the right hand that I cannot see because remember job said I know my redem live and in the last day in my flesh see so it's going to have to be flesh to flesh amen amen got to be flesh to flesh all right now let's go to Psalm 16 this is going to be just a few things we're going to read and then we'll get in get back into to Revelations remember Revelations what is Revelations that's our book and stick a little bit of this in your mind and remember that brother randam said John as one man toed to Brad wow One Man Ted to bride all right so Psalm 16:8 I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved now watch watch the psalmist therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh and why do he bring his flesh in My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption still talking about the flesh thou Wil show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures for forever more oh see when that's pleasure you could read that scripture down to the ages but now when I was reading this I was thinking about turning 57 years old and having pains I never had pains in that place before brother boy that even hurts to raise your hand he raised his hand we us now we go at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more Psalms 4810 okay there you got two of them according to thy name oh God so is thy praise unto the ends of the Earth thy right hand is full of righteousness right all right we got Psalms 1101 the Lord sent unto my Lord did thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot St got it 110 I'm read Spanish better than you can 1 10 one go ahead not today that's your job not my job that's your job the Lord said unto my Lord sit down at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot St now remember what is The Last Enemy to be destroyed even Paul comes up and he says look he said he said I see I see Jesus but I don't see all things but I see Jesus cuz the enemies had not been put under Paul kept seeing people dying you say no my enemy is um Arthur arthritis no that's not your enemy your enemy is death all that takes you to death and hey we've had people 25 years old fall over dead so it's not the symptoms that last enemy is death and watch where he plants it he plants it on Earth amen amen Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol amen that's the connection when God and man became one that's exactly what he did he put all that under his feet but it's not going to be made known until the end time to amen amen till I make sit down at my right hand listen we're going to actually fulfill that scripture sit down at my right hand until I make thine enemies so who's doing it you or him him he's doing it not you he's doing it Psalms 1386 though the Lord be high yet ha he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth far off though I walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me amen amen but see we look say oh that's my soul that's your body body's talking about sure he came to clean the soul sure he came to bring but he had to open that way just like he did for Steven so that remember he said the world shall see me no more now listen the world saw this Jesus as being preached 2,000 years ago remember the prophet of God telling us that they couldn't get him off the cross but thank God a prophet came off put in amen he brought him off remember remember it's out of and into amen he brought that man off the cross he said that man is here now to do what he's supposed to do amen amen Romans 8:33 now watch Paul pick it up R Who Shall lay anything to the ch charge of God's elect it is God that justify who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us amen amen that intercessory work just does not include your soul listen amen he knew your body was going to be rotten it's not a mistake or a he didn't have to have a crisis meeting in heaven when when we fell in flesh we had to cuz he always wanted to be in flesh don't you see this he didn't want to be MDC MDC delivered a message but MDC didn't save Abraham when MDC came over into Jesus Christ the same person and was born a baby just like you and me then now the Kinsman can do his job and that's what you know and really we say oh well he did the Kinsman work and bought me but but but but not my body when Boaz raised that shoe the Bible says all all that Naomi had Naomi had was and he even got a bride out of it amen and restored her back amen amen so the story like I said you you see these layers in the Bible and I was telling him this morning you know as a baby you see things a little different than you do a baby would see that they'd have to crawl up the St and it would seem like Stone Mountain but now look I'm older this is nothing until I get real older then it goes back to the way it was before it becomes a mountain again but you understand what I'm saying things we see as a babies the same thing we see now is in a different way that's why the layers of the Eternal Word of God that's the layers remember Paul says he says he said I I spake as a child in other words I ate baby food but now what did he say he said leave those there's more to eat there's more there's more meat but it's not that we took this Bible and throw it away and then brought another one in listen if this is the Eternal Word of God and I'm asking you that question these 66 books are going to last for an eternity there's got to be layers brother Larry that we don't even see got to be things that we will not see down here that we'll see there but they still a lot more down here that we need to see here but as a baby you see things different but as we grow up now we've come to the place to where everything we see should be focused on that Ministry of the son of man because that's what changed Jesus's body nothing else not another word changed his body except that three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ the son of man on Earth amen so why are we looking to find it from somebody some great this one or great that one lay here laying right here amen amen we just got to start looking at it with eyes of a more mature person amen amen you love the Lord now what we're looking at is that we're going to go now Into the Book of Revelations because it talks about a throne there in Revelations 3 but now let's not forget the right hand of power because to me that's speaking of a glorified body that was a glorified Jesus standing in that scene is that all right amen that was a glorified Jesus standing there with a glorified body and keep in your mind when he comes to John on patmas how'd he come let's read Revelations 320 behold I stand at the door and knock if if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in with him and St with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches all right let's go to number five read what brother Brown says and we'll make a few comments 1963 how can I overcome Jeffersonville Indiana indana I like the way brother Brown takes some of them Ai and use out do you notice the arrangement ain't no way in front of that he's a southerner to the core him and Paul talk just the same all right did you notice the arrangement of that see set with me in yeah you can read that the minute sit with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that is that's in hisain now hold on a minute Jesus doesn't have a domain except you and me oh yeah we're going to a city but Jesus told us he said the Tabernacle you're looking for is you he said it's in you amen the Tabernacle we're looking for is not somewhere out under the building that was a temporary place the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a temporary place the three stages amen amen Body Spirit and soul inner Court holy H amen that was a type Moses went to heaven brother Brown said and saw Jesus saw the city come back and wrote down what he saw and that's the way they lived it until Jesus said I'm him I'm the Tabernacle I'm the one you've been looking for I was veiled behind Badger skins you couldn't see me but now I'm veiled in human flesh so that you can see me but you took the you took the curtain and sewed it back up they'd rather seen the badger skin than the flesh skin that's the same thing now everybody wants to go back to their traditions and not see the real God made manifest in me and you in my Throne that's in his domain and now as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God nothing left out nothing left out the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does this one is from eternity to ET just think of that amen from eternity to Eternity all the kings and England they had this great domain but there was an end of it because somebody else took another part not in this one this is from eternity to Eternity so to sit on the throne would not be correct but in that Throne so everything in that Throne the whole domain mine and yours and that's what we're looking at the end time amen amen it has no boundaries what the problem with the church ages there were boundaries Luther went from here to Here Right Wesley went from here to here Wesley amen Pentecost went from here to here they stopped but God kept moving that's why the prophet God had to preach the seals and all the great Revelations and not to be sacrilegious but he opened up that same portal that he opened up for St to see to see Jesus standing on the right hand of the father in glory amen that's where the Prophet went now remember he saw a vision this is not a vision pinch yourself remember my brother when he when he have a vision first thing he' do is he' pinch himself remember he pinch to see if I'm in this world and sometimes he wouldn't say that he knew he was in this Dimension no see how perfect even a prophet God letting him go across a curtain of time not one part of that flesh went he said I looked back and I saw my arm Moving Out of Body Experience whatever you want to call it but when he went across that curtain those people were real they hugged his neck amen amen he was just as real as they were real on that side but body with his body had to rest in Hope until what until what until you and I connect somewhere we got to connect back to that Jesus did not just come to save your Soul he came to save everything cuz he's taking it right back with him that's why that the false revelation of the of the denominations about getting a brand another body bre in the Bible there's no way stand on the right hand of the father I mean that's just as well to us it's simple but to them it would be profound but thank God he showed it to us God he brought it to a little man that told us I'm going to raise in that body Redemption is not replacement amen sure it's going to be made new just like this Earth is going to not be destroyed going to be burned off and made new amen you'll be changed in your atom the first set atoms your mom and daddy gave that's what's killing you but being changed in our atoms to have a body like his glor body if Steven could have had a real good Revelation he said I'm going have a body just like that I'm going have a body just like that but what was his Revelation that that was Jesus standing on the power and authority of God everybody all right say Amen let's go through this real slow for a second let's go to Revelations one brother D has told us many times that Revelation is our book the book of the bride bride if John typed the bride everything John went through we're going to go through amen Revelations 10 God told him to eat the book amen and he ate the book so you and I have to eat the book but I want you to watch this now keep in your mind remember what I said John tops the bride the right hand of power is the glorified condition is that all right you okay so now let's read and see where let's see where this thing's transferred and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle amen amen bride form a man doesn't have PS a girl has PS amen amen so it's a feminist form that John was looking at is that all right say Amen hey I told him this morning listen say it again sing sounds like German J you wait okay scooching pay attention I told him I said I'm 57 I'm hard to hearing you going have to amen real loud for me to hear you all right now watch here we are in the Book of Revelations the bride's book and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One locking into the son of man this what John sees what he sees GED by PS with a golden girdle his head and his hair was whiteed like wool and what does that show judgment his Wi on cuz listen I was thinking about this yesterday we as the bride we don't judge up there the Bible said the books were open and were judged out of that book so where is the Judgment what's written down goes on here this is the Judgment that's why that we take he took on our judgment if you'll ever see that then you'll know you are sinless and that's why we don't have to go to judgment because our book is [Music] blank when he tries to even open the book it's a blank page cuz we're so wrapped up in Christ if he gets a white page we get a white page oh we haven't listen we think we know a lot we a't tapped all right here we go let's get done and his feet was likeing toine brass as if they burn in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters now what is Waters people okay all right people he was in the people hello and he had in his right hand Seven Stars what I tell you the right hand look your glorified body he said all them seven ain't glorified hang on a minute and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword the word they preached amen Amen brother okay [Laughter] [Applause] I'm just okay and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength now this is the part that I that this may not bother you a bit but I just start beating my poor old chair to death when I saw him who's him who came to John on pmes Jesus glorified Jesus glorify Jesus I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I'm going to glorify the first one and I'm going to glorify the he laid his right hand upon me power the right hand of Fellowship in other words he's saying look the power I have is I'm glorified now John fear not so are you John the full here John this is why I'm going to do it because the whole bride first to the last going to get a glorified body amen and they're going to get it right here right here I am he that liveth in was dead and behold I'm alive forever more and the two things we fear the worse hell and death I think we may have the keys to I don't think he's I don't think the devil's got them and if Jesus has transferred everything from him to us how you say that in Spanish H okay amen this is better than I thought write the things which thou H has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter now the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden Candlestick the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are all the people in the seven church that all right amen so when he laid his hand on John he said John it's over write these things in 1150 sermons they're already here the key is not somewhere we got to go get the key is right there brother rap and Faith lays in these books and you got remember said in like in the throne if you read it on you going to die but the Bible says hear what the spirit says to the churches amen amen he had in his right hand he laid his right hand on me and said hey buddy it's over and I don't know if that means anything to you but it sure does me and you know we we if he's got the key of death in hell then you can take Steven's part of death out if you take St part of death out then we've got that opening that goes right up to the throne right amen now in Revelations 5 Revelations 5 and i beheld l in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as they had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book now what is the book you you are that book Christ took out of the right hand right of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of who and they sang a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests we shall re on the earth that is a physical Reign but he's first got to R in the earth amen now how you going to do that last quote and then we'll be done hope it didn't bore you Lise took too long I'm just humbling myself yeah I know you're doing good buddy it seems like we've done this all day day we have listen watch this lay of say in church age watch brother Brown watch him just laser this thing in now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus unless he has been living that word all right swallow this one your prayers your fasting your repentance no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne brother but he gave us an out it will be granted only to the word Bride As The Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that Throne remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the World Church system this Lan age ends in a blackout of the word thereby sorry thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by the obedience to the word after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hund and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus so there's the prescription right there you're going to be in the word all the way because remember the Ephesian Church barely missed it but they're waiting for someone and even as Steven was looking looking into another dimension he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of the authority of power he was dying same way with me and you as we die physical as we die as we die to ourselves what opens up cuz look we know we know we're going to get a city we going get a man we know we're going to have a m we know we're going to have a a honeymoon we know going to have a thousand year Millennial we know we're going to live for an eternity but we're still living here s Gail what's going to get us from here today it's the opening just like with Steven as he was the first Marty and God opened that portal for him to see I believe brother Brandon was same way he was able to see into that Dimension but not leave him there he brought to re reation of the son of man back here that right hand of power is not coming it's here still hurt that's what I was telling them this morning I said are you going to believe to see or see to believe if you see to believe you're an unbeliever if I if I say oh I wish brother Lis was here brother L don't talk to about me talk about yourself you interpret it just right thank you I don't have to believe he's he's coming I don't have to I don't have to believe anymore do you he's here amen that's our problem we're trying to wait till we see it before we believe it Believers believe before he's even here same thing with God God has been here the whole time that's what I telling him this morning he's been here the whole time what we does is he tries to open the door we shut it and actually we took the knob off the outside you have to you have to open a door and like brother Dale said just like that quote you got to go out you got to go out to him that's exactly what we got to do we got to go out rededicate ourselves reconsecrate ourselves study more pray more do a little bit of the work yourself and listen it's like I told him this morning it's good to be a baby but it's not good to stay a baby not good to stay a baby what if we all would have been one year old number one we'd have a lot of confusion today we'd have to feed you change your diaper but no we've grown up we know what to do know toat we should know what to do with ourselves we should conduct ourselves in a manner pleasing to God amen amen to get out of here Steven was so full of the Holy Ghost if he saw Jesus Christ standing on the right hand of the father all glory and power brothers and sisters he's not there anymore he's right here he's in me and you but it's got to come from the word out you got to eat that word and it's okay to be a baby but 10 years still a baby grow up all of us need to grow up need to grow up we all need to be more mature in God but you see how you you read something and you say well you know we know what brother B said about the power and authority right hand was the power and authority of God but never seen that that had to be the only time that was ever spoken is when Jesus was standing there the glorified body and when he was getting ready to leave here he said Hereafter you're going to see the son of man you know what he was saying he said in other words you're either going to get a revelation to me now you're going to stand before me there cuz remember he's going to you're going to stand before the son of remember the son of man had power to forgive and he even gave that power to you he said whoever sins you retain they retain whoever sins you remit they remit you and I you and I understand more of the flesh then we should ever understand about it being connected to God that's what really got me when when when Jesus comes to John and lays his hand now look John felt that hand John felt that hand he put his right hand on John and says fear not John I'm the first and the last I started in your new birth I'm going to end it with a glorified life amen I'm going to end it with a glorified body and that's the Gap we got to fill in and that's what we as ministers and you as as Ley this is the time amen Paul said leaving the principles leaving not do away with but anyway leave let that be Foundation if you don't understand please come to Bible study ask questions don't be afraid I I'll be available to help brother Dale now to do more to be available if you have any questions please if you have questions you need ansers amen we need answers the question is is how we going to get from here to that glorified condition sister Anna that's what it's narrowed down to if you're born again and you've been baptized you got the Holy Ghost you're you're reading the word God's perfecting you through the word what else are we looking for Don't Look Back well I don't know if I'm born again you better know you got to know because if you do know then you can progress on us if not you stay in the same place so that's what we have to look for the next thing coming is a resurrection and then people getting a glorified body what a pull you think a third you think the third pool strong you just wait till we pull them out of the ground all the way from Paul IR Martin Colum Lu Wesley Wesley you say I can't see it we got to believe and then we'll see let's than the right hand of power now you'll know from now till till the day we get out of here talking about a glorified condition not just that that he's overcome and and you don't sin anymore no that's the glorified condition Jesus standing in a position that he said come on mus Y come that he said the things I do so you do also that's what struck me the other day the things I do so listen it ain't rocket scientist you don't have to be a rocket scientist we just got to act like him if we act like him it'll cause the same thing problem we don't act like him you gotta lead singing yeah okay we go lead singing find us a song Let's uh let's everybody give brother Lis a hand let's s please help me twice today and I appreciate that praise the Lord yeah it's a pleasure and it's as taxing on him as it is me cuz he's got to hear it in one language and speak it in another all I got to do is speak it in one language well kind of kind of one language but you love the Lord listen we're getting close to something we're getting close to something Glory you say what is it brother way if I didn't knew I'd tell you but we getting close to something because something's got to happen to twist it to just make that little turn come on brother to get us what all Steven had to do was get in the position that he was supposed to be in you say well he was getting stoned to death listen if getting stoned will show me Jesus Christ in the glorified body right bring it on right but I think our stoning comes every day when we walk in this building woo if you don't get stoned to pray for me
