[0:56] pick some
[0:58] other
[1:05] ouch we're on emotional roller coaster
[1:08] today she loves me she hates me she
[1:11] loves all right let's turn to
[1:16] Isaiah
[1:19] and let's kind of take a little
[1:24] different angle on this first
[1:26] seal not a different angle but maybe uh
[1:32] maybe we can see a little more about
[1:33] this man of
[1:35] s
[1:38] 14 Isaiah
[1:46] 14 we're going to start with verse
[1:52] 12 mil you sure you don't need that
[1:54] thing just
[1:58] w Wait a minute let me
[2:00] put it straight and don't let itate put
[2:03] it straight over
[2:10] there makes too much
[2:13] noise
[2:15] sorry I thinking about your lovely
[2:18] wife being cold over
[2:22] there okay Isaiah
[2:26] 14 continuing on the first seal let's
[2:29] just background a few minutes we looked
[2:31] at the man of sin in first in 2
[2:34] Thessalonians correct so this man of sin
[2:36] must be
[2:38] exposed as we've said
[2:40] before we need to see that guy or that
[2:44] person going away from us we we don't
[2:47] want that person to
[2:49] reside in anything that we
[2:51] are all right that's why the first seal
[2:54] is so important when you see the
[2:57] revelation of one true and living God
[2:59] and how he comes come to you not a
[3:00] second person or a third person but the
[3:03] person of almighty God the one that
[3:04] created the heavens and earth come to
[3:06] you at a new birth and drove Satan out
[3:08] of your soul correct right drove him out
[3:13] but now you got to remember one thing
[3:15] when God cursed the Earth back in
[3:18] Genesis brother randam said the title
[3:20] deed went back to God of course he's the
[3:22] one that created it but there's a
[3:24] squatter there's one in between you and
[3:28] God called the devil this kin to you
[3:31] because of this thing right cuz when he
[3:33] caused Eve to do what she
[3:35] did Adam to do what he did made that
[3:39] that Son of God fall not lose eternal
[3:43] life in his soul but he lost eternal
[3:45] life in this thing right here this is
[3:47] what this is what we
[3:49] must we must
[3:52] overcome and just like we're talking
[3:56] about conquering and to conquer God's
[3:58] Got To Conquer our
[4:01] you can't do it I can't do it and the
[4:03] devil don't want you to do it the devil
[4:04] don't want to do it either long as he's
[4:07] got this thing right here and it can die
[4:09] and will die he's always got a little
[4:11] hold or a little grip brother rown calls
[4:13] him a squatter now
[4:15] squatters you see them a lot in other
[4:17] countries you don't see them as much
[4:18] here in the United States because we own
[4:19] all of our land but like in Jamaica
[4:22] there were squatters they would go and
[4:24] just build a house on a piece of
[4:25] property cuz there was nothing there
[4:28] what they never had a title deal to that
[4:30] piece of property but as long as
[4:32] somebody didn't walk up and say hey I
[4:34] got the title deed to this property you
[4:36] need to leave that stay there forever
[4:38] well that's what the devil is he stayed
[4:40] on this ground called this
[4:43] Earth forever Satan Satan's not worried
[4:46] so much about the round ball of Earth he
[4:48] he wants your Earth he wants what come
[4:49] out of it right and God cursed the Earth
[4:52] so that's where your body came out of so
[4:54] we have a curse on this thing but now
[4:56] when God raised from the dead where we
[4:59] see one one true and living God come
[5:00] into Focus that that God died in human
[5:04] flesh that God raised in that same human
[5:07] flesh quickened that mortal
[5:09] body and then Romans 8 says that same
[5:12] spirit that raised up that man from the
[5:14] dead will also Quicken your mortal body
[5:17] all right by what by his spirit that
[5:19] dwells in you all right excuse me so now
[5:23] we know that this man of sin then is
[5:25] very prevalent he's always been right
[5:27] there but he's hid himself like God has
[5:31] hid himself in Simplicity Satan has hid
[5:33] himself in religion right he know not to
[5:36] hide himself in the drunk and the and
[5:38] the prostitute and The Gambler and the
[5:40] smoker and the Drinker and the carouser
[5:43] and the adult that's obvious that's
[5:45] right right that's obvious right so
[5:49] where does he want to hide himself in
[5:51] religion that's right cuz that's where
[5:53] the deception is there is no deception
[5:55] if a man walked in here with earrings in
[5:57] both ears and shut a beard down in front
[5:59] of him and had two women on on each side
[6:01] of him we'd know for sure one thing he
[6:04] wasn't a godly man that's right but now
[6:06] what about a man walks in here with a
[6:07] suit and a tie on sits down sits in the
[6:10] congregation or Gets behind the pull pit
[6:13] that's right yes this is the seat of
[6:15] Satan that's right if you allow that to
[6:17] be the seat of Satan right all right so
[6:19] this is where the deception is and I've
[6:22] told you before many times people you
[6:24] realize one thing that here is where
[6:28] Satan really wants to
[6:30] not out there cuz if he can be here he's
[6:33] got out there okay same way with the
[6:35] denominations he fed them Trinity they
[6:38] ate it up so he's got them that's right
[6:41] fed them one set fed them one way of
[6:44] baptism which is wrong brother Brown
[6:46] said come from the pits of Hell father
[6:48] son Holy Ghost baptism come from the
[6:50] pits of hell why why did it come from
[6:52] the pits of Hell father Son and Holy
[6:54] Ghost baptism didn't come from the pits
[6:55] of hell when Jesus spoke it that was the
[6:57] true word of God Satan took and twisted
[7:00] it a little bit and said okay that's
[7:01] your baptism so you've done away with
[7:03] the name of Lord Jesus Christ now it's
[7:07] just a
[7:08] title right a squatter that's right
[7:11] that's a squatter that's right he's
[7:13] squatting on people's property right
[7:15] religious people that's right us that's
[7:18] right message people all of us he's got
[7:22] he's got a I don't
[7:25] say let me try to say this right but
[7:28] he's got
[7:30] a little bit of authority from God to do
[7:33] the things he's doing yes okay CU God
[7:36] allowed or God give him power was given
[7:39] remember cuz we're going to read right
[7:40] here this guy was a bluff to begin with
[7:44] and watch he has bluffed us so much he's
[7:47] made us believe in that father son Holy
[7:50] Ghost baptism in that Trinity in that
[7:53] hell being Eternal and all the things
[7:55] like that Satan really wished hell was
[7:57] eternal cuz he'd be he have eternal life
[8:00] see the see the see the thing in his
[8:03] mind he wants to be
[8:05] us Satan wants to be
[8:08] us that's
[8:10] right and he wants hell to be Eternal
[8:12] cuz he knows if he if hell if he can
[8:14] make people believe hell's Eternal then
[8:17] then what do they do see they they say
[8:19] well you know this is that and this is
[8:21] the other but if hell's Eternal brother
[8:22] B said if hell was eternal you'd have to
[8:24] have eternal life and if you have
[8:25] eternal life you got God so that's what
[8:27] the seed of Satan wants to be want not
[8:29] be like God he wants to be God that's
[8:31] right all right that's right so now and
[8:33] that's what he wants to be in your life
[8:34] he wants to be the god of your life all
[8:36] right so now let's read right here let's
[8:37] read what this guy really is all
[8:41] right Isaiah
[8:43] 14 verse
[8:46] 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[8:49] Lucifer son of the
[8:52] morning now see Jesus Christ is the
[8:54] Morning
[8:56] Star Satan is the son of the morning
[9:00] so
[9:01] close I want to show you something real
[9:04] close in just a
[9:05] second how are thou cut down to the
[9:08] ground which didst weaken the nation the
[9:12] ground remember the Earth is what's
[9:14] cursed for thou H has said in thine
[9:17] heart in other words the very being of
[9:20] Satan your heart's where everything is
[9:23] right as a man thinketh in his heart
[9:25] heart so is he right and heart is not
[9:29] this thing it's the it's the inner core
[9:31] of you that's right the inner part all
[9:33] right that's the heart of
[9:35] you cuz brother R said Jesus Christ was
[9:37] the very Heart Of God it wasn't God's
[9:41] heart no he was the very Soul substance
[9:44] being
[9:46] personality of God nothing separate from
[9:50] God for thou H has said in thine heart I
[9:54] will Ascend into heaven now so where was
[9:57] he ascend means go up so where was he he
[10:01] was on the earth yeah all right I will
[10:04] exalt my
[10:07] throne above the stars of God now who
[10:10] are the stars of God you and I remember
[10:13] the Stars Seven Stars God held in his
[10:16] hand he wants to exalt himself above
[10:18] those seven chch days Messengers those
[10:19] prophets all right I will sit also upon
[10:23] the mountain of the
[10:26] congregation in the sides of the North
[10:29] now there is a scripture that I didn't
[10:30] have time to look up but I'll look it up
[10:32] maybe for next time that that's where
[10:35] you and I are supposed to reside the
[10:37] congregation on the side of the north
[10:38] the city of the great king remember we
[10:40] sang the song All right so Satan don't
[10:42] want to be in the South and us be in the
[10:44] north right Satan don't want to be in
[10:46] the west and us be in the East all right
[10:49] he wants to be right
[10:50] there I will Ascend above the heights of
[10:54] the
[10:55] clouds I will be like the most high now
[10:57] this is the Old Testament he want wants
[10:59] to be like God when we read 2
[11:02] Thessalonians he sees how the baptism of
[11:05] the Holy Ghost changes people's lives
[11:06] and he wants to get into the people just
[11:08] like God gets into the people at the
[11:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost so he don't
[11:11] want to be like God he just worship as
[11:13] he is God remember we read that we'll
[11:16] watch how he evolves I'll read it again
[11:19] okay excuse me I will
[11:22] Ascend above the heights of the clouds I
[11:25] will be like the most
[11:26] high yet Thou shalt be brought down to
[11:29] Hell to the sides of the
[11:33] pit they that see
[11:39] thee not literally so much see means to
[11:44] what understand let's read it like that
[11:47] they that understand thee shall narrowly
[11:51] look upon
[11:52] thee and consider the saying is this the
[11:57] man that made the the Earth to
[12:01] tremble that did Shake
[12:05] kingdoms that made the world as a
[12:07] Wilderness and destroyed the cities
[12:09] thereof that opened not the house of his
[12:13] prisoners and I wrote in my Bible Satan
[12:16] truly is a
[12:17] bluff he had no power is this if we look
[12:21] on this person and say is this the man
[12:23] in other words we are looking at the
[12:25] understanding that this man has no power
[12:28] and look how he tricked he bluffed the
[12:31] Nations he bluffed the people he bluffed
[12:35] religion he bluffed his way all the way
[12:37] from Heaven down to here cuz there's no
[12:39] way you can defeat God if God cre if
[12:41] somebody created you guess what he's got
[12:44] one up on you that's
[12:46] right you know we say the old say old
[12:48] father said I'll bring you into this
[12:50] world I'll I'll take you
[12:52] out well guess what God brought Satan
[12:55] into the world and guess what God's
[12:57] going to take him out right I mean
[12:59] that's a true statement I mean we say
[13:01] that in laughing but it's the truth why
[13:03] because we formed them we made them we
[13:05] made the children we we other words
[13:07] we're telling them hey as long as you're
[13:09] my son I got one up on you cuz I'm your
[13:11] daddy that's
[13:14] right I don't know how big a guy is it
[13:16] doesn't make any difference how big your
[13:17] children get they should always respect
[13:20] their parents any or their father anyway
[13:22] but
[13:23] listen they that see
[13:26] thee and I underline that double
[13:29] underline output me cuz see Isaiah is
[13:32] prophesying they in other words there's
[13:35] a point somewhere they they that
[13:38] understand you are going to say this
[13:40] statement is this the
[13:42] man see people this right here is when
[13:45] death is destroyed in your flesh right
[13:49] here all right this is when death is
[13:53] destroyed in your flesh right
[13:55] here when you see or understand that
[13:59] that man is a
[14:01] bluff because where is the greatest
[14:03] battle is in our mind that's right and
[14:07] Satan roams around in that thing just
[14:09] like his his that's
[14:12] right but we have the word of God that
[14:14] promised us that someday somebody's
[14:16] going to be able to overcome cuz see
[14:18] we're supposed to have the mind of
[14:19] Christ anyway that's true and even but
[14:22] see the mind of Christ does not always
[14:23] say well it's that same brain that Jesus
[14:25] walked no the same brain that Jesus
[14:26] walked on the earth with with
[14:29] was tempted that's right tried and
[14:31] tested but he's without sin amen huh
[14:36] right a human mortal
[14:40] brain yet without sin yes now if we're
[14:44] supposed to have the mind of
[14:46] Christ guess
[14:48] what we're not going to we're not going
[14:50] to dwell on the thoughts that come
[14:53] that's
[14:54] true but we're going to cast them out
[14:56] that's right cuz remember the casting
[14:58] out of the red dragon is not just the
[15:00] casting out of religion or what that's
[15:02] the casting out of the red dragon that's
[15:04] in me and you right the white dog black
[15:07] dog is fighting like this right here War
[15:10] tell me one thing for sure when you
[15:13] weren't born again was there a fight in
[15:15] your
[15:16] mind no you picked the beer up and drank
[15:19] it you went to the Beer Joint you went
[15:21] and bought beer and wine liquor didn't B
[15:24] I mean it was like all it just like me
[15:25] and you going to church now you just
[15:27] went right come on people
[15:29] yes did you have a fight sure there was
[15:31] listen now there was times that God
[15:33] would convict me sure enough about
[15:34] things cuz I knew the right I knew I
[15:36] grew up in this message I knew the right
[15:38] part but see I overrode that because
[15:41] there was nothing inside of me to raise
[15:43] up that's true or I wouldn't have done
[15:45] the things I did but see he did those
[15:47] things Jesus come and was raised up as a
[15:49] child just like me and you okay come up
[15:53] to an adulthood come through puberty
[15:55] come through done all the things all the
[15:56] little things that we all went through
[15:58] he went through and some of the older
[16:01] ones said one time I said well he didn't
[16:02] go through old age he died at 30 the
[16:04] Bible said he looked over 50 years old
[16:07] so in his body he was bearing the marks
[16:10] of an older person and when he died at
[16:12] Calvary brother Brown said he died for
[16:14] everybody so he died for all the
[16:15] arthritis and everything that gets you
[16:17] at the end of your age he overtook that
[16:20] there's no God don't look at age and say
[16:22] well I can't heal him cuz he's got
[16:24] arthritis and he's 80 no look at that um
[16:27] brother um
[16:29] Upshaw Congressman Upshaw 60 something
[16:32] years he laid on his back and when he
[16:33] was 12 years old so that made him 82
[16:35] years old Lord let him live about five
[16:37] more years to go around the country and
[16:39] tell the people how he was healed he was
[16:41] healed at 80 years old 82 years old from
[16:45] being paralyzed for 60
[16:47] years but you know what we look at
[16:49] people and go well they're just getting
[16:51] old well that's true you're going to
[16:52] have aches and pains Jesus had aches and
[16:54] pain but when we overcome that thing and
[16:58] say God it's not the symptom we're
[17:00] looking at right is we're able to see
[17:03] where that symptom comes from a
[17:06] bluff that symptom comes from a bluff
[17:09] Satan is bluffing us because what are we
[17:11] going to live in what are we going to
[17:13] live in when we when we take the change
[17:15] what are we going to live in the body
[17:16] you're in right now right
[17:20] okay we're not going to be gray-headed
[17:22] but remember back when you about 24
[17:24] years old 23 man you could just do
[17:26] that's what we're going back to
[17:29] but you say well we're getting older
[17:31] somebody's going to realize one day that
[17:32] that is lying vanity remember in in the
[17:34] Book of Proverbs I believe it say talks
[17:36] about ly job talks about lying vanity
[17:39] it's just lying
[17:41] vanity a
[17:42] li that's right we're we're actually in
[17:46] our body we're living a lie it is but it
[17:49] was a lie that Satan told Eve remember
[17:50] we read it in second Thessalonians it
[17:52] was the lie not a li it was the lie that
[17:54] Satan told e so our bodies are living a
[17:56] lie because inside of you right now
[17:57] doesn't matter how old you are today
[18:00] there's an 18 to 20 year old person
[18:02] inside of
[18:03] you that's right a 20-y old trapped in a
[18:06] 70 year old body or 50 or 40 or 30 or
[18:10] whatever all of us see when we come to
[18:13] the realization of that that that body
[18:15] is more real than this one that your mom
[18:16] and daddy brought that's when this one's
[18:19] going to take over the outside man right
[18:23] right cuz when Jesus went to hell paid
[18:25] the price when he come back up when he
[18:27] stepped into that
[18:29] body think about this when he stepped
[18:32] into that body that body was laying
[18:33] brother R said laying dead and cold in
[18:35] the
[18:36] grave hadn't started deteriorating yet
[18:39] but it was beginning to the process was
[18:41] started cuz they couldn't see corruption
[18:43] but hey when that thing died the blood
[18:45] vessels went black everything went all
[18:48] that nasty stuff that death is involved
[18:50] with but when he come back and got into
[18:52] that body and raised it
[18:55] up it wasn't beaten bruised his beard
[18:59] was not pulled out of his
[19:01] face sure he still had the scar here and
[19:04] the scars in his hand because that's
[19:05] mine and your sin but they striped his
[19:08] back all that became new but where was
[19:12] that that was that same man that was in
[19:16] MDC that spoke to Abraham and at calf
[19:20] that was the same theophany man that was
[19:23] there everybody understand that God is
[19:26] not an old man everybody has a
[19:28] portraying of God being this old
[19:30] withered up thing with a long no my
[19:33] God's a youthful 20 year old man never
[19:36] has been nothing else never will be
[19:38] nothing else that's that's the that's
[19:41] the mystery that you and I have to see
[19:44] in this end time amen is that what's
[19:46] inside of you is more real now at the
[19:49] new birth now if you're not born again
[19:50] you still got the old adamic nature you
[19:52] still got the old uh black soul right
[19:56] right you still got the old old nature
[19:59] that will let you do the things of the
[20:01] world and back to my point there was no
[20:05] fighting or Waring in your
[20:07] members right right but now that you're
[20:10] born again or even if you just be
[20:13] justified you've come to a Consciousness
[20:15] right that something's wrong that's
[20:18] right and even in your justification and
[20:20] sanctification you may still reach for
[20:21] the beer because in justification you
[20:23] still got the old
[20:24] nature everybody understand that I want
[20:26] everybody to understand this this is
[20:29] this is what we teach in this church
[20:30] that justification only chops off your
[20:33] past sins that's right you're still a
[20:34] sinner amen now some way by Grace if
[20:38] you're if you die during that time God's
[20:40] going to give you eternal life I believe
[20:42] that because you've been Justified your
[20:45] sins have been forgiven if you die then
[20:47] you go to heaven but you don't come up
[20:48] in the bride you don't come up in the
[20:50] resurrection you got to go to the white
[20:52] Throne cuz your sins have to be judged
[20:54] there amen but now you're born again
[20:56] today if you're born again filled with
[20:57] the Holy Ghost you've got everything you
[20:59] need it's all done and finished that's
[21:01] right but let me finish that
[21:03] statement we're not that way out here
[21:06] that's right that's why we need that
[21:08] that's right exactly right see that's
[21:10] what the seals have given us an
[21:11] opportunity to do it's not only to to to
[21:14] have these virtues working in our life
[21:17] but the absolute love of God the love of
[21:19] God was before the foundation of the
[21:21] world he had children that's the love of
[21:24] God the love of God if you you got to
[21:26] have something to love right that's true
[21:28] right that's right so when you were out
[21:30] in the world and you love the things of
[21:31] the world it didn't bother you to get up
[21:32] and put a cigarette in your mouth and
[21:33] light it I mean it just wasn't common
[21:36] nature for me to just reach and get a a
[21:38] pouch of tobacco and stick it in my
[21:39] mouth you know or I'd get condemned when
[21:41] Daddy and Mama come by you know they
[21:43] like that thing
[21:47] out but that was the condemnation why
[21:50] because the Holy Ghost was in them
[21:52] condemning
[21:53] me right right you sisters put on a pair
[21:56] of pants if you wore pants some of you
[21:58] never have but if you put on a pair of
[21:59] pants back in the world did you get up
[22:01] in the morning and go I shouldn't do
[22:02] this no no you just put them on you just
[22:05] put them on you just War that's right
[22:07] didn't think about it that's right but
[22:09] when you come to a Consciousness that
[22:10] that was wrong even though you were may
[22:13] be justified and you still put them on
[22:15] there was that little bit of a little
[22:16] click that said you should do that
[22:19] that's right but now you can still overr
[22:22] in justification and put them suckers on
[22:24] go right out the door never bother never
[22:25] bother you a bit that's right but now
[22:28] when you come to sanctification all that
[22:29] stuff needs to start going out okay
[22:32] sanctification cleans you up and puts
[22:34] you in ready for service not in service
[22:37] but ready for
[22:38] service all right ready for service not
[22:41] in you're not filled with the Holy Ghost
[22:42] then that's right all right right but
[22:44] you should start getting a better
[22:46] consciousness of the things that hey I
[22:48] need to go to church right I need to
[22:51] read my Bible I need to be around a
[22:53] different group of
[22:55] people cuz brother R said he gives you a
[22:57] new Spirit at sanctification that you
[23:00] can even tolerate your own old self cuz
[23:03] you got a lot of the old self still
[23:04] there true okay that's right and even
[23:06] when the Holy Ghost comes listen you can
[23:08] go through justification sanctification
[23:09] baptism the Holy Ghost in 2 minutes or
[23:12] you can take two years or you can take
[23:14] 10 years it doesn't matter but the Bible
[23:17] says those who is Justified he already
[23:19] glorified so if he just if he truly
[23:21] Justified you he knows you're going to
[23:23] go on now you don't I don't the preacher
[23:24] may not know but he knows you're going
[23:26] to go on
[23:28] okay so that's to me if you stop if you
[23:32] stop anywhere in your in your in your
[23:34] Christian experience if you say I got a
[23:36] doubt go back to that justification and
[23:38] say God forgive me of my past sins I
[23:40] don't ever want to do them again and
[23:42] then change do something different you
[23:44] know brother R made a statement one time
[23:46] I get to preach and and quit doing
[23:48] Sunday school amen but brother BR said
[23:51] one time he said if you are
[23:54] stingy don't go pray and fast no he he
[23:58] said just start giving stuff away he
[24:00] said do the vice versa you're like
[24:05] man that's just too easy that's the
[24:09] problem it's too
[24:11] easy if you're stingy he said give you
[24:14] money
[24:16] away in other words so if you're if
[24:18] you're if you're this you said well I'm
[24:21] I I don't go to church to church okay
[24:25] car going to
[24:26] church why don't read my Bible start
[24:29] reading your
[24:30] Bible Well I watch too much television
[24:32] throw it
[24:34] out or at least unplug
[24:38] it we got to remember we got to tithe
[24:40] our time God wants our time more than he
[24:42] does our money he wants our time more
[24:45] than he wants our money that's the thing
[24:46] that this man right here has given us
[24:49] he's given us less and less time because
[24:51] now everything so instant Y come up out
[24:54] of that thing the other night you know
[24:57] coming from camping and all and soon as
[24:59] you hit where you can get Sal service
[25:00] your phone starts going ding ding ding
[25:02] ding ding ding ding you got emails right
[25:03] and left well you know what that takes
[25:06] up your
[25:08] time God wants your time more than your
[25:10] more than your money God don't need your
[25:13] money but he needs your time that's
[25:14] right all right so this man right here
[25:17] and this I wrote the beginning of death
[25:19] and that's what it is this is the
[25:20] beginning of death because this is where
[25:23] Satan is coming he ascended watch what
[25:25] he done then we look at him but now
[25:27] let's go to Second Thessalonians we read
[25:29] it but let's read it
[25:31] again and let's see what that man comes
[25:39] to you see nobody's been
[25:41] able verse two or chapter 2 nobody's
[25:45] ever been able to understand the devil
[25:48] until
[25:49] now simply because he fed everybody
[25:53] during the ages the father Son and Holy
[25:55] Ghost
[25:55] baptism right right God winked at that
[25:58] ignorance people were saved and
[26:00] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[26:01] Ghost under that but see that couldn't
[26:04] get that couldn't get their body
[26:07] change they could receive the baptism of
[26:09] the Holy Ghost and may even believe in a
[26:12] trinity that to us that would
[26:15] be we couldn't do that in this age you
[26:18] can't believe a trinity and be born
[26:20] again once you seen the light that's
[26:22] true that you're in now that's right you
[26:25] can't do that that's right no way no
[26:27] that's right no way you can't take three
[26:30] Gods that's true you can't take three
[26:31] Gods you can't believe in a trinity and
[26:33] be born again right I just don't believe
[26:35] that I you can't cuz who you getting
[26:38] born again by that's right the Father
[26:40] the Son or the Holy Ghost one of which
[26:42] one which one amen but we realize the
[26:46] father Son and Holy Ghost is the same
[26:47] person brother BR said that person
[26:50] person comes to you at the new birth and
[26:53] burst you into the body
[26:55] that's that one person so so now we got
[26:58] people that that you know Catholics pray
[27:00] to the father and and he takes it to the
[27:03] or I mean to the Holy Ghost and they
[27:05] take it to the Sun see Satan just got
[27:07] them all pulled apart it's true but we
[27:09] come under the understanding of the
[27:10] message of the hour there's no other way
[27:13] you can receive the true the true Holy
[27:16] Ghost and that doesn't mean one was
[27:17] false true because in Revelations it
[27:20] says the faithful and true witness
[27:22] talking about Jesus Christ brother Ry
[27:24] said that's not true like in it was
[27:25] false it's like in your SE being the
[27:28] full like remember I was saying before
[27:29] you know like
[27:31] thish last Sunday you know that doesn't
[27:34] do away with the room but this is all
[27:35] you can see well believe in what you see
[27:38] true and that's what theyve done during
[27:39] the ages they believe in what they
[27:40] believed in what they saw yes right but
[27:43] Satan was still working through all that
[27:45] you know why cuz there was not a son of
[27:47] God took a body change under
[27:49] that see if Satan can defeat us and keep
[27:53] us dying and going by the grave he can't
[27:56] bring the the Saints can't come back to
[27:58] this earth right scripture says one
[28:01] scripture keeps them from coming back
[28:03] Paul said we which are
[28:06] alive and remain to the coming of the
[28:09] Lord shall not prevent or hinder those
[28:12] who are asleep now that
[28:13] scripture holds them from coming back
[28:16] just because an end of time or God's
[28:19] finished or the last one comes in even
[28:21] when the last one comes in people we got
[28:23] to take a body change to get them people
[28:25] here that's right God's got to be
[28:26] standing on just like he was at the
[28:29] resurrection to call those people out of
[28:31] the ground cuz he said I am the
[28:32] resurrection and the life so there's not
[28:34] any
[28:34] other so he's got to be standing on the
[28:37] earth not him
[28:39] physically right cuz his body doesn't
[28:41] come back till the Millennium but we are
[28:43] his
[28:44] body if Satan can do this right here you
[28:47] and I should be more than able to do the
[28:50] other that's read this before we go
[28:52] up verse three let no man deceive you by
[28:55] any means which that happen see Paul's
[28:58] telling them don't let no man deceive
[29:00] you but they have deceive to S to
[29:02] Believe In Father Son Holy Ghost no
[29:04] eternal hell I mean eternal hell and all
[29:06] those things that's why brother BR come
[29:08] back to TI the loose end bring them back
[29:10] to Paul and then preach his
[29:12] message which is to tell you
[29:15] that you didn't sin in the first place
[29:18] but you got to realize that you can't
[29:20] just walk up to Satan and say I didn't
[29:21] do that he's going to go yeah you did
[29:25] and I'm going to prove you did cuz I'm
[29:27] make you do it again but with god with
[29:30] God on the scene see the day of Christ
[29:32] is at hand which is here let no man
[29:34] deceive you by any means for that day
[29:36] shall not come what the day of Christ
[29:39] what is the day of Christ I believe it's
[29:40] the day when Revelation 10:7 when that
[29:43] when Christ came down in that Mighty
[29:45] angel came down on the earth and and
[29:48] went through brother brandham and and
[29:50] spoke through him because it's the voice
[29:52] spoke through him to me and you so
[29:55] Christ is here he's not coming there's
[29:57] not a uh the Rapture is already in
[30:00] progress and he's here now okay but
[30:02] there's a physical coming but this is
[30:04] his coming right here right in the group
[30:06] of
[30:07] people except there come a falling away
[30:10] first and that man of sin be revealed
[30:12] all right that's the guy back over that
[30:13] we just read about that wanted to be
[30:15] like God this guy don't be want to be
[30:18] like God now in second
[30:21] Thessalonians to be like God is
[30:23] Antichrist he wants to be
[30:25] God all right who opposes and exalteth
[30:28] himself above all that is called God now
[30:30] that don't sound like that powerless guy
[30:32] back over y this is the guy that's
[30:34] exalting himself and making himself God
[30:36] or that is
[30:38] worshiped so that he as God not like God
[30:43] as God that's one of them little bitty
[30:46] words as and if all that as God sth in
[30:50] the temple of God showing himself that
[30:52] he is God
[30:55] God he's moved from Isaiah looking at a
[30:58] at a at a man that was just powerless
[31:00] and a bluff and nothing to him and we
[31:03] walked by and you know it'd be like this
[31:05] for just an example it'd be like
[31:08] us we never saw this man just just think
[31:12] in your mind we never saw this powerful
[31:14] guy say say it's a president of the
[31:16] United States but we never saw him he
[31:18] he's he's this something we hear about
[31:20] but we never see his
[31:21] picture and he's just got this grip on
[31:24] all of us and but where is he getting
[31:25] his power through the people that he
[31:28] gets in their mind and says hey this man
[31:30] is powerful this man this and we just go
[31:32] about our time and we got this great
[31:34] ruler over us and he's mean and and
[31:37] exalted and arrogant and and makes us do
[31:40] things that we don't want to
[31:42] do and then somewhere we get an
[31:47] understanding and can look through the
[31:51] veil or through the White House in other
[31:53] words walk in the White House and you
[31:55] see this swiveled up about 100 50 year
[31:57] old man that can't get out of a chair
[32:01] can't even
[32:02] talk drooling all over
[32:05] himself and you
[32:07] say is that the
[32:10] man is that the man that made all the
[32:13] nations bow to his
[32:16] feet somebody say yeah that's that's
[32:19] that's the guy that's
[32:21] right now what would that make you and I
[32:23] feel
[32:24] like oh man we feel stupid
[32:28] right well that's what we look got to do
[32:30] with Satan we got to see that that's
[32:31] what he is you say oh no he no he's not
[32:35] he's not he's powerless unless you and I
[32:37] give him the power that's true that's
[32:39] why that first seal is so important
[32:41] because the first seal saw a
[32:45] separation from a prophet here stands
[32:47] the Lamb with a book in his hand and
[32:49] there rides off the White Horse Rider
[32:52] riding away from his Revelation brother
[32:55] Bram had a revelation of who God was one
[32:58] true and living God and Jesus was his
[33:01] name and that man was he said if you got
[33:04] two he said one's God cuz there's only
[33:07] one God that's right he said there's one
[33:09] God he said if there two people he said
[33:11] one of them must be the devil same thing
[33:14] with you and I if you got a good thought
[33:15] and a bad thought like the white dog
[33:16] black dog see now let me finish this one
[33:18] time now that we are born
[33:20] again now see that's where the War Began
[33:24] yes all you need to really smoke that
[33:25] cigarette all you need boy look that
[33:27] pretty girl over there boy look that
[33:29] what sure back beer she looks good you
[33:30] know that old that old you is still
[33:32] there right that old thinking mentality
[33:35] I wish I could forget all the things
[33:36] that I did but Satan make sure you don't
[33:39] but you know what those are just
[33:41] thoughts that's true that's the man of
[33:43] sin that's the power that we are giving
[33:46] him because we set and dwell on it right
[33:49] let's just realize one thing we're not
[33:50] worth anything that's right none of us
[33:52] there's no big eyes and little you
[33:54] that's right the only thing that that
[33:56] that I have is a little gift to be able
[33:58] to talk to you and and what I do is is
[34:00] throw out words that's true right sister
[34:03] John I throw out words right that's like
[34:06] sister Johnny said last Sunday she you
[34:07] know she wanted me to draw that big
[34:08] thing that I did about the new birth and
[34:10] how you made them she said I got to
[34:12] realize I got to understand that not let
[34:14] somebody else do it for me not in other
[34:15] words not somebody draw it up and hand
[34:16] it to me well that's what people been
[34:18] doing with quotes they say here I got a
[34:20] quote for this I got a quote for this I
[34:21] got a quote for
[34:23] that this must disappear
[34:25] right into here right once this is
[34:29] Brother B said as long as it's on the
[34:31] pages see if it's on the pages it's got
[34:34] to come from Pages through your what
[34:37] Your Eyes which are part of your body
[34:41] which is
[34:42] fallen and then it's got to go where
[34:45] into the
[34:46] Battleground Satan is in here too the
[34:49] Battleground then you either are able to
[34:51] kick it out and let it go down 16 more
[34:53] in or you sit here and dwell on it and
[34:56] don't let it get to your heart that's
[34:58] you stop up the flu that's right read
[35:01] the greatest battle ever fought brother
[35:03] talking about flu getting stopped up
[35:04] well that's what happens right here with
[35:05] the Statue of perfect man I like to turn
[35:08] I'd got to turn these up this way and
[35:10] have faith going up this way and what
[35:12] happens with us we pack that flu with
[35:15] junk and let the faith just go to right
[35:17] here let the knowledge just go to right
[35:20] here Temperance go to right here
[35:21] patience go to and what we keep it
[35:24] suppressed right right but as the word
[35:26] opens up and as we see more and more
[35:28] what God has for us already here then
[35:32] all we got to do is say hey satan even
[35:36] though you may destroy this body job
[35:38] said in my flesh I shall see God so
[35:40] Satan you may drop you may drop an a
[35:42] bomb on
[35:43] me but not a literal one but I'm talking
[35:47] about his bomb which is unbelief right
[35:50] and may go by the grave but guess what
[35:52] we don't ever live we never live that
[35:55] first shield shows me one thing we don't
[35:57] lose right we don't lose when we see him
[36:00] riding off that means he has no
[36:03] power if you see something riding away
[36:05] from you is he going to harm you if he's
[36:07] riding away from you he can't harm you
[36:08] when he's going in that direction cuz
[36:10] there's not one coming from this
[36:11] direction right you got that lonox man
[36:13] and Eagle protecting the
[36:16] temple right lonox man and Eagle we'll
[36:19] read it in Ezekiel that's what we're
[36:20] coming to we read it in Ezekiel where
[36:22] that Lineo man and Eagle everywhere
[36:24] brother R said every time you need them
[36:26] they turn in that direction and he said
[36:28] they're always going
[36:30] forward so if Satan is riding off and
[36:32] you can see him that's the Revelation
[36:34] you and I have to see that Satan has
[36:36] rode away from your Revelation and you
[36:39] can understand his tactics we're a whole
[36:41] lot closer to home whole lot closer
[36:44] let's
[36:49] go
