[1:59] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[2:01] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[2:04] seat of scornful
[2:13] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[2:15] the river of water that bringeth forth
[2:18] his fruit in due in season his leaf also
[2:22] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[2:25] shall process

[3:28] said unto me thou art my son thy this
[3:32] day
[3:33] have i begotten thee
[3:44] thou shalt break them with a rod of iron
[3:47] thou shalt dash them in pieces like a
[3:50] potter's vessel
[3:59] shall the lord with fear and rejoicing
[4:02] with tremble
[4:03] serve the lord with fear and rejoice in
[4:06] with trembling
[4:08] kiss the son lest he be angry and ye

[12:38] amen god bless you this morning
[12:42] thank the lord there's a lot of demonic
[12:43] power sicknesses out there so we have to
[12:46] keep fighting and trying to keep
[12:48] ourselves under the blood and it just
[12:50] it's just a lot of sickness going on
[12:52] mine my granddaughters were said to be
[12:54] home this morning
[12:56] back down to about the myrtle beach area
[12:58] where the church
[13:00] my baby daughter live and
[13:02] my wife had to get up early she said she
[13:04] left out before six o'clock right after
[13:06] six and drove him all the way down so
[13:09] and so but you know by god grace we're
[13:11] still gonna get the victory
[13:13] i'm not gonna get my mind worried about
[13:15] sickness don't worry about healing
[13:17] i don't i'm a tight person i don't study
[13:20] i'm sick the people read all this stuff
[13:21] i want to know i don't need to know
[13:23] about it i need to know how to stay
[13:25] healed
[13:27] i mean you know i think god i didn't
[13:28] come here to study demonetia a demon
[13:31] power i couldn't understand the power of
[13:32] the holy ghost hello we thank the lord
[13:35] this morning so this morning i'm going
[13:37] to take a title this morning from that
[13:38] scripture right here i stand at the door
[13:41] and knock if any man hear my voice he
[13:44] said i would open and open the door i
[13:46] will come in to him and he suffered him
[13:49] and he with me and i took the title from
[13:51] now unlock god
[13:54] hallelujah and i reason i took this
[13:55] started because i realized here that god
[13:58] had been locked out not uh having been
[14:00] locked out uh people that in the church
[14:03] were going on and on and said we're
[14:05] gonna have church but to really they
[14:07] already god has never been in
[14:09] you cannot have churches have god being
[14:11] inside hallelujah the word so they say
[14:14] we gonna have a church but they have
[14:15] locked god out by some tradition about
[14:18] something that uh on something that do
[14:21] not give god the glory we call ourselves
[14:23] a religious nation but we have locked
[14:25] god out he's on the outside he's not in
[14:28] hell
[14:33] i was enjoying the sunday school lesson
[14:35] he just started using every quote i had
[14:37] wrote down i said man this
[14:39] but god if that goes to show this is not
[14:42] about one man hallelujah this is about
[14:44] the power of the holy ghost in control
[14:46] of his ministry how do you say brother
[14:49] said the bride will have the same mind
[14:51] saying the same thing how do god have
[14:53] called one man over here to have a
[14:55] different revelation with his one holy
[14:57] ghost how did that work i liked the
[14:59] brother wade brought it out this morning
[15:01] and it was real clear people said well
[15:03] they uh
[15:04] they didn't have the holy ghost and
[15:05] martin luther
[15:06] they didn't have the holy ghost and
[15:08] wesley by the way brothers and every age
[15:10] had a different holy ghost
[15:12] and underwear every hands had their own
[15:14] revival but the dividend would have
[15:16] lived as we begin to mature in the world
[15:18] the bride come to full adoption
[15:21] to full
[15:22] perfect revelation to change her body
[15:25] honey that's the only thing to do with
[15:27] her he gives us enough faith and enough
[15:29] revelation to change our bodies
[15:32] thank you lord hello begin to look at me
[15:34] i'm talking here he said look god out
[15:36] right here
[15:37] god been locked out and i began to take
[15:39] on these things i said you know we we we
[15:41] we're trying to find a way
[15:44] in the day that we we we even know that
[15:47] we're in the message but because you
[15:49] said i mean the message do not mean that
[15:51] god is in you all
[15:53] that mean that you've been around the
[15:54] message
[15:55] i need another one there was plenty of
[15:57] people that was in the message when
[15:59] moses got when moses was called on the
[16:01] scene to bring him out of egypt i knew
[16:03] that was in the message
[16:05] but when it was time to go across jordan
[16:08] they were not in the mission was not in
[16:10] them
[16:11] they come out but they didn't go in
[16:14] being in the message and when you come
[16:15] out in redemption at two points go come
[16:18] out and go into and they come and come
[16:21] out unto moses but they did not go into
[16:23] joshua hallelujah so we found her they
[16:26] would be uh they don't run so god was
[16:28] locked out right
[16:29] they had god they know what they were
[16:31] doing that was in the message but they
[16:34] never unlocked god honey that way
[16:36] because unlike god it's when they went
[16:39] into the cross over in the cave of land
[16:41] and took the land and eat the old corner
[16:44] of the land and god was in control
[16:47] hell they said we begin to go and look
[16:48] here so i begin to just think on the
[16:50] things i said so the job was at the
[16:53] crossover
[16:54] and our job of the day is to receive the
[16:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[16:58] honey and in the world you say i mean
[17:00] the full baptism oh my god and
[17:04] not just the anointing of the holy ghost
[17:06] but to live your life the literal person
[17:09] of jesus christ living on the inside of
[17:12] you the same yesterday today after amen
[17:16] right
[17:16] i begin another here i begin to realize
[17:18] here he said brother josie because
[17:20] people didn't know god
[17:23] and underwent people that knew god
[17:25] and then had
[17:26] had uh understanding how he uh uh uh who
[17:30] he was and this is jesus and everything
[17:32] when jesus was on earth that did not
[17:34] mean they were saying right come on how
[17:36] do you remember people saying the people
[17:39] that had it i had to do that i i i know
[17:42] god i i i i see god and i know we're
[17:45] here how did i know i'm saying that did
[17:47] not mean they would say that mean that
[17:49] they had a uh understanding or maybe had
[17:52] some knowledge of who he was
[17:54] but they could not be saying like
[17:56] brother that bloody saved him they could
[17:58] not be saved as long as jesus was on
[18:00] earth they could not be saved on the day
[18:02] of pentecost
[18:04] anyway that's the only way they could
[18:06] let god in
[18:08] so god walked with him in the bottom and
[18:11] he walked with him but on the day of
[18:12] pentecost he walked in
[18:15] so we begin to look here i begin to take
[18:17] these thoughts here and uh and uh uh
[18:20] beginning to look at these things here
[18:21] so i'll be thinking of what i'm gonna
[18:23] deal with because we are we are fighting
[18:25] the most religious
[18:28] they mighty they're into all ages
[18:30] how did that work so these engines that
[18:32] we fight against
[18:34] while people having so many problems so
[18:36] many battles and so many things are
[18:38] going wrong so many times
[18:49] get the holy ghost
[18:51] because you ain't gonna be able to
[18:52] handle the spirits we're dealing with
[18:53] the probably gonna use the quotation
[18:55] from future home
[18:57] i'm gonna use this here because we gotta
[18:59] understand what age we're living in so
[19:01] we can understand why we're going
[19:02] through these things that we're going
[19:04] through right i mean why i'm having
[19:05] these problems i'm having why don't you
[19:07] know your people trying and then
[19:09] somebody said brother when will i quit
[19:11] having evil thoughts i think when you
[19:12] die
[19:14] all right
[19:15] you can't stop a bird from flying over
[19:16] your head that's right honey but you
[19:18] could you can stop it for building the
[19:20] nest there it ain't no burning on land
[19:22] on my head and build a nest here if i
[19:24] can help it right
[19:27] you like walking around with a bird nest
[19:28] in your head i know right now right then
[19:30] you need to go get some mental health
[19:32] right
[19:32] right
[19:33] because he don't blow him on my head
[19:36] holy he said he goes to use his
[19:38] message in future home page 11 he says
[19:41] uh what does it mean then
[19:43] he said that stencils
[19:45] and sickness and death
[19:48] and politics
[19:50] people's politics ain't gonna fix
[19:52] nothing no no hell you're gonna read all
[19:54] your life and you're gonna try to
[19:56] believe all your life when i vote the
[19:58] right man in you when y'all i'm dead
[20:00] when you get the right man and he'll be
[20:02] in the handing
[20:04] hey you won't get the right man in this
[20:06] edge
[20:07] how did we go he said that sister right
[20:09] there is not a devil i believe that
[20:12] politics is sinful man
[20:14] and sinful women's right and evil smith
[20:17] will be all
[20:19] be
[20:20] yeah be uh all be gone and done away
[20:23] with and annihilate
[20:24] see
[20:25] it has to to be done that way
[20:28] because we are going to live right here
[20:31] we approve that by the bible right here
[20:34] here is where we are living where we
[20:36] live and notice thorns
[20:39] germs all sickness and things will be
[20:42] completely taken away
[20:44] all this and these are all this is it is
[20:48] ex
[20:50] let me see
[20:51] y'all i didn't
[20:52] existing that is in the earth now
[20:55] man-made system politics
[20:59] politics said
[21:01] kinds of evil spirits
[21:04] that have been
[21:06] that the world is terminated with and
[21:08] all the
[21:09] heaven above is
[21:12] above us here is terminated with evil
[21:14] spirits
[21:16] now we're going to we're going deep here
[21:19] then he said we're going deep here uh
[21:21] lord are we going deep and and long in
[21:25] in this sea then i dropped down a few
[21:27] other pages and then brandon began to
[21:29] say sir and he used it he used another
[21:31] page he was right on there he said both
[21:33] the heavens and the earth is terminated
[21:36] with devils
[21:37] that can't accuse her before god
[21:39] hallelujah before god and jesus ended up
[21:42] making an intercession what uh will
[21:44] jesus make his intercession for us see
[21:46] why the devil they keep pointing their
[21:48] fingers they did this they did that but
[21:50] the blood hallelujah that blood still
[21:53] comes
[21:54] anyway we are in a way we've got to
[21:56] fight against the power devils
[21:58] hallelujah i want to and something else
[22:01] i'm going to use another quotation hero
[22:03] and he uses here he he talks about the
[22:05] feasts of the trumpets and he began to
[22:07] talk about the
[22:09] depression that was on israel why
[22:11] because of those
[22:12] demons hitler was let loose at 200
[22:16] thousand thousand dollars right they
[22:18] told me that the tormentor jews is here
[22:20] to fight the blind now and then when we
[22:23] and then what did he was saying here but
[22:25] i i demonic power is in the religious
[22:27] realm it's an ecclesiastical power realm
[22:30] ain't no supernatural devil how did we
[22:33] got two or two men devils to fight us
[22:35] every day
[22:37] maybe he said we would break down this
[22:38] attention every man might be fighting
[22:40] 200 devils a day
[22:42] extra
[22:43] i don't need no extra demons
[22:46] holy good lord
[22:47] but you if you're going to need extra
[22:49] demons you're going to be fighting
[22:50] against extra paddy minded power you're
[22:52] going to need our extra boost of
[22:53] revelation understanding honey that's
[22:55] why it took god to bring a word by to
[22:57] give us faith to stand against these
[22:59] demons i mean don't worry anyway so we
[23:01] got to understand here the things that
[23:03] we'll talk about you say what i'm going
[23:05] to do how can i how can i make this
[23:08] thing easy
[23:10] there's no easy way but i can say get
[23:11] born again how do you know you have to
[23:14] have a new birth to make it out of this
[23:15] age how did this is that nervous
[23:17] breakdown and every day why because
[23:19] demons is down accusing us right have
[23:22] you accusing us night and day before god
[23:24] holly and the point of it is if we don't
[23:27] realize who we are the devil gonna make
[23:28] us believe that we still is in that same
[23:31] condition right right right exactly
[23:33] i'm gonna take care of it now i didn't
[23:35] want to bring that out here before i
[23:36] start so i want you to realize this so
[23:38] we're in this uh we're in the battle so
[23:40] we fight it and we're going through
[23:41] trials and tribulations all the time and
[23:43] we try and people that they are giving
[23:46] up how they want they are giving up in
[23:48] the fight
[23:49] the reason people don't make it and hold
[23:51] on to the faith they're not willing to
[23:52] fight for it
[23:54] how do they want it to be easy
[23:56] but the problem because when we take the
[23:58] land and we will have to fight for every
[24:00] inch
[24:01] you got to fight against what you got to
[24:03] fight against depression you got to
[24:05] fight against demonic powers all kind of
[24:07] sure sign of depression you got to fight
[24:09] against hatred you got to fight against
[24:11] all these things if you want to land
[24:12] right
[24:13] back right hey you know you know the
[24:15] world show you nobody want to fight
[24:17] right
[24:18] in other words this is the age of layout
[24:20] let's see
[24:21] in this edge of relaxing and this red
[24:23] just self-living have put god kept god
[24:26] on the outside highly because nobody
[24:28] don't wanna i put forth a sacrifice i'll
[24:30] fight that way here hello there were you
[24:32] and what like he said the statue of a
[24:33] perfect man if you're going to get up
[24:35] there you got to be willing to fight
[24:36] right honey you got to read willing to
[24:38] say i'm going all the way and i'm going
[24:40] to receive what god got for me in the
[24:41] word how about people don't want to
[24:43] fight now
[24:44] honey
[24:48] uh second timothy two and verse four
[24:49] through seven how did paul say i have
[24:52] fought a good fight
[24:54] hallelujah
[24:54] i have fought a good fight in the world
[24:57] i am fight mother i am kept the faith
[24:59] right in other words why he had to fight
[25:02] he had to fight against a lot of spirits
[25:04] he had to fight against ray he had
[25:06] to fight against uh uh being bit by a
[25:08] beast he had to fight against hunger he
[25:10] had to fight but whatever he was power
[25:12] he had to fight against persecution he
[25:14] had to fight and fight against being
[25:15] rejected but paul did not give up right
[25:18] right hallelujah and in other words this
[25:19] is the end satan's job here is to make
[25:21] the people quit fighting
[25:24] and give up
[25:25] i like the way he says so something we
[25:27] begin to realize here
[25:29] as i begin to take this here right man
[25:31] using a quotation one time
[25:34] and i believe that he uh
[25:36] said it for a reason to show us what
[25:39] that we gonna have to take we're gonna
[25:41] have to take the left you said what
[25:42] brother jewel you say what do i have to
[25:44] fight you gotta fight to keep your hood
[25:45] anyway if if you know if something is
[25:48] not willing to fight for
[25:49] y'all you gotta fight for your stance
[25:51] right heaven to be the son of god you
[25:53] gotta let the world when you come down
[25:54] do you got to be willing to say uh i'm
[25:56] going to i'm going to stand for jesus
[25:58] and let the world go back hallelujah
[26:00] it's a fight to keep y'all staying in
[26:02] the fight to keep uh it's a fight to let
[26:05] the world know i'm not like the rest of
[26:07] the world i am a son and daughter of
[26:09] almighty god
[26:10] they might be able to disagree with you
[26:12] but i'm willing to fight for it right
[26:14] that's right hallelujah another word so
[26:16] we begin to look at what you know
[26:17] brother used a statement here and he was
[26:19] you it was a simple statement
[26:21] he says
[26:22] it's not the size of the dog in the
[26:24] fight right
[26:26] it's the size of the dog in the fight
[26:29] but it's the size of the fight that's in
[26:30] the dog
[26:32] in the world no matter how little hill
[26:34] but if he willing to fight
[26:36] to keep it the whole is a a position
[26:38] with christ so now we begin to go in
[26:40] here but i begin to think over here look
[26:42] how god for this age has been locked out
[26:45] how did i begin to think on these things
[26:46] here because why what is it the thing of
[26:49] it is that we are fighting against this
[26:50] day
[26:51] we find here that jesus said and and he
[26:54] i stand at the door and knock
[26:57] if you read on the previous said that he
[26:59] that was in an age that was rich
[27:02] and increased with goods
[27:04] and have needed nothing self-living hell
[27:06] actually smiling the peoples out right
[27:09] that was the day it's hard for young men
[27:11] to raise up and take a passing position
[27:13] because why it been too easy
[27:16] pressure come down he ready amen i can't
[27:18] deal with this how do you know why
[27:20] nobody will in the fight what are we
[27:22] going to do when he's older these old
[27:23] warriors start to die he gotta be
[27:25] raising them new warriors right holly we
[27:28] don't you say when the rapture be here
[27:29] now at 2 or 2 15. you say that
[27:33] you said that i'm not the point of a
[27:35] deal if god don't let it come in 215
[27:38] it'll be a lot more people go drop off
[27:40] right
[27:40] they got people that are trying to make
[27:42] it happen according to their minds
[27:45] god is not concerned about time
[27:48] they're thinking about the people that
[27:49] study prophecy under moses and they
[27:51] probably had studied the prophecy that
[27:53] the israel was going to be deliberated
[27:55] in 400 years and they knew this should
[27:57] have not it didn't go 440 years right
[28:01] people's already said days 2 15 gonna
[28:03] wrap it up i don't know
[28:05] i'm not gonna saturday but i know one
[28:07] day if we go to two if we go to 3015 we
[28:11] ought to still be fighting all right
[28:13] we all still be fighting because god is
[28:15] gonna it's gonna happen right right but
[28:17] didn't put it in he people gotta be told
[28:19] in this world everybody's gonna totally
[28:22] reject god just not to be there right
[28:24] right
[28:25] you can see there's a rejection spirit
[28:26] here but i want you to notice here
[28:29] we talk about fighting for a minute why
[28:31] we need to fight we gotta we got to go
[28:33] through things and and that's what it
[28:34] did because of the way it is man have
[28:37] been given up right right if there were
[28:39] and to give up when you got revelation
[28:42] is actually when you give up when you
[28:45] got revelation and you say well i don't
[28:46] know god going to do this for me you
[28:48] actually have acne accepted accepting a
[28:52] delusion by the devil
[28:54] something that a spirit that makes you
[28:56] quit serving god is a delusion
[28:58] have caused you to surrender to another
[29:00] power that was not god
[29:02] hallelujah you said yeah you know he
[29:04] used the quotation of christ and missing
[29:05] god revealed failed he says
[29:08] and he was dealing with this we hear
[29:09] what because he realized a delusion is
[29:12] what put god on the outside right
[29:15] he says here
[29:16] if a man says he's born to get paid 34
[29:19] of christ mr got revealed he said if a
[29:21] man says he's born again
[29:23] and try to place the promise of christ
[29:26] in the last day
[29:28] to some other age
[29:29] making him christ yesterday but not
[29:31] today making a different holy ghost
[29:34] right a different baptism of the holy
[29:36] ghost he ain't no good it ain't the same
[29:38] one how you making it if he was the holy
[29:41] ghost yesterday he'll be the holy ghost
[29:43] all the way through the book
[29:45] holy hell if he'd ever put forth another
[29:47] birth it'll be it'll bring the same
[29:49] baptism on the holy ghost
[29:52] hallelujah
[29:53] he says here make a new glass make him
[29:55] to somebody making him christ yesterday
[29:57] but not today that man
[30:00] or that person has been in a delusion
[30:03] by satan right
[30:05] satan
[30:06] spirits is to bring up the spirit of
[30:09] delusion
[30:10] a false idea
[30:12] a false a false
[30:14] or a false revelation
[30:16] a false a false seal hallel
[30:19] another word when satan saying you're
[30:20] making you think i don't got the holy
[30:22] ghost how did he got you under the power
[30:24] of delusion all right helen what are you
[30:26] doing he's keeping god locked out of
[30:27] your life
[30:28] because he know the holy ghost is the
[30:30] power of the holy ghost every video the
[30:32] prophet said as long as you confess i
[30:35] got the baptism of the holy ghost you
[30:37] got it right right but why so many
[30:39] people quit fighting oh well i don't
[30:41] think i got it well they look at that
[30:43] they're looking at the flesh they look
[30:44] at their mistake but they're not looking
[30:46] at the word
[30:48] the word says i got the holy ghost and i
[30:50] must keep my confession the same
[30:53] if i go through this trial if i have
[30:54] this problem come up i still got the
[30:56] holy ghost i'm going to keep fighting
[30:58] and i'm going to keep my confession
[31:00] until my body comes up into it
[31:02] hallelujah jesus
[31:05] he's a delusion
[31:07] by saying that if if that man says
[31:10] that he believed
[31:12] and that and it does not manifest
[31:14] himself through him then he quoted he if
[31:18] you notice here where mark 16 where he
[31:20] says that i'm trying to find it
[31:25] and jesus said in mark 16
[31:29] these signs should do what
[31:31] hallelujah another word these signs your
[31:32] what
[31:33] you the brothers you the people said
[31:35] don't
[31:36] they talk so much intellectualism they
[31:38] think they're gonna fight the devil with
[31:39] justin cohen out there being able to
[31:41] quote the message you gotta be able to
[31:43] demonstrate the message
[31:44] you to know that god gave you power over
[31:47] a clean spirit how do you do it where
[31:49] are they people doing this everybody's
[31:50] doing but yeah they might be they might
[31:52] be doing this but they're not in the
[31:54] land right right
[31:55] they had crossed the majority yet but
[31:57] you with the baptism the only god these
[31:59] sides shall follow you that believe we
[32:02] don't have to take the devil we don't
[32:03] have to back up right right we back up
[32:05] because of delusions right right
[32:08] exactly right hallelujah these guys are
[32:09] following them that believe in my
[32:12] uh
[32:14] to all the world and to every age
[32:17] casting out what
[32:19] devils
[32:20] what we're dealing with
[32:22] whole time and the whole earth is
[32:23] terminated with demons
[32:25] sicknesses all kinds of diseases how
[32:27] what we gonna do go in the shell put
[32:29] ourselves in a capture honey like
[32:31] michael jackson yeah
[32:34] yeah
[32:34] they slept in a two with ah
[32:37] getting the perfect iron and the clean
[32:39] and all that that's good

[32:54] mean i do i believe we ought to take
[32:56] caution sure hey i believe we ought to
[32:58] take caution that is that and this human
[33:00] that just comes in but i'm not going to
[33:02] walk around like fear of what the only
[33:04] disease is coming on the world that i'm
[33:06] going to be one of them that gets struck
[33:07] with this plan when the bible says if i
[33:09] stay by the word i knew that none of
[33:11] these diseases
[33:12] they might try to become but they would
[33:14] not be able to prevail over me
[33:19] these are the words he said to everybody
[33:22] that never speak with speaking with
[33:23] terms all these great manifestations of
[33:25] gifts
[33:26] that would follow
[33:28] he said they they shall not uh they may
[33:31] not they may
[33:33] they may be they aren't you but they
[33:36] will
[33:36] and heaven and earth shall pass away but
[33:40] his word won't so he's telling us as
[33:42] long as you got the baptism of the holy
[33:45] ghost
[33:46] i don't care what the devil tried to say
[33:47] honey we will be able right hey you got
[33:50] to put it in your mind i will be able to
[33:53] take whatever that's come my way
[33:58] but we talking about here
[33:59] we're just talking about heroin god has
[34:01] been put on he's been put out
[34:04] he's been put out at the church right
[34:05] now right another word people said in
[34:07] the word
[34:08] just because everybody said lord why do
[34:11] i why did myself why do i have to go
[34:14] through so much to be a christian
[34:17] i'm going to tell you what
[34:19] like he said in the statue of a perfect
[34:21] man
[34:22] god god every man got a punch coming at
[34:25] him exactly you know saying you got a
[34:27] punch coming at you
[34:29] in the words and god's gonna see how you
[34:30] stand
[34:32] so now we go to the book of peter
[34:35] here it is he is teaching us peter was
[34:38] he was telling us this this word right
[34:40] here and this right here
[34:41] does not
[34:42] you've got to have a strong arm of faith
[34:45] to
[34:46] operate in this realm that peter's
[34:48] talking about uh first peter 4 verse 12.
[34:53] let me find that yeah first peter 4
[34:55] verse 12 and verse 13 here watch what
[34:58] peter said first peter the fourth child
[35:01] he goes right here
[35:03] now he's telling us something that does
[35:05] not seem to
[35:07] come you know in our mind because we
[35:09] realize here this is what we don't want
[35:11] to go
[35:12] we don't want this to happen
[35:13] but it must happen
[35:15] holly and if it don't happen we ain't
[35:17] going to never get to where we want to
[35:18] go holy that way you said today what it
[35:20] is god got no grandchildren right god
[35:23] has no grand churches hallelujah it
[35:25] doesn't work you know my daughter's my
[35:27] daughter's is my problem i have a little
[35:29] problem with my daughter
[35:31] and because they saying dad
[35:33] when we was growing up
[35:36] we didn't get to jump on the couch
[35:39] we jumped on that counter we got snack
[35:41] down
[35:45] when the grandchildren's come over here
[35:47] they got candy on the couch they got
[35:50] crumbs on the count they jump on the
[35:52] couch and you don't do one thing about
[35:54] it
[36:25] tate scroll me right yeah paul says here
[36:29] beloved
[36:30] thinking not strange
[36:32] concerning what
[36:35] man trust
[36:37] oh but we this is what we don't want to
[36:38] do this is why god can't get in the
[36:40] church now hallelujah we go when a trial
[36:42] come in first thing you do i'm out of
[36:44] this church right here say ever since i
[36:46] got saved i'm going to do so many try
[36:48] people give up you know when people get
[36:49] baptized that is when the quickest time
[36:51] and one that is the most uh dangerous
[36:53] time of their life
[36:55] if you're not going to serve god don't
[36:57] go get baptized because once you get
[36:59] baptized you open yourself up
[37:02] you have opened yourself up for more
[37:04] devils to get in you all right
[37:06] if you're not really going to do it
[37:07] don't make a commitment like that come
[37:09] to get that time did not do it go all
[37:11] the way you are actually going to be
[37:12] worshipped right all right
[37:14] you know and the reason they don't go no
[37:16] further people don't move no
[37:17] because as soon as they do this
[37:19] they're going to get baptized
[37:21] like jesus you're like gonna do
[37:23] this you go through your you go to your
[37:25] desert experience
[37:27] and they feel like since i got baptized
[37:28] everything got worse
[37:30] i'm having worse battles than i ever had
[37:33] what did god do he proven do you really
[37:34] want it
[37:35] he proven that you're gonna keep your
[37:36] confession you know but i don't know in
[37:39] the word my mind seems like i'm having
[37:41] ever since i i i gave my heart to the
[37:43] lord i'm i'm going through worse of
[37:45] things than i ever been highly wise i'm
[37:47] going through this because god tried to
[37:48] get your wing from the boiler right
[37:50] honey you would not make this a rapture
[37:53] holy little demon or daddy you've got to
[37:55] meet god for yourself hallelujah amen
[37:58] glory ride he said thank you nothing's
[38:00] saying
[38:01] they cannot screen concerning the fiery
[38:02] trial is to do what
[38:06] try you yeah
[38:08] it's no way for me to get out of it
[38:10] there's no way for you to get out of it
[38:12] we're like he just preaching that we
[38:14] come into the statue of a man we're
[38:15] gonna have to come to a full adoption
[38:16] somewhere hell it's already been good we
[38:19] didn't walk through that we don't have a
[38:20] good we don't have that today that would
[38:22] have been pampered along with enough in
[38:24] this match when his sons of god gonna
[38:25] realize who they are right how did we
[38:28] serve you gonna realize him i'm a son of
[38:30] god and i let no demon power i'm letting
[38:33] no mind bottles i'm letting no
[38:34] depression i'm letting no anxiety take
[38:37] this out of my confession right right
[38:39] he says here and detroit you as though
[38:42] some strange thing happened unto you
[38:45] but this is right here
[38:47] i'm asking god to help me to get to this
[38:49] point right right i'm asking god to give
[38:51] me the script right hallelujah give me
[38:54] the script
[38:55] how do you know you know you know
[38:57] now you know it ain't nobody when trials
[38:59] hit you it's hard to say i want to
[39:01] rejoice
[39:02] honey so you know that could not be none
[39:03] of your virtues right how do you realize
[39:06] that is not a human virtue here this is
[39:07] not a human way to rejoice this has got
[39:10] to be something supernatural you're
[39:11] scared to do that
[39:12] and the only way you can do that you
[39:14] must be able to recognize who you are
[39:17] and why why are you going through this
[39:18] he's about to rejoice in so much
[39:22] as ye are partakers of christ's
[39:25] suffering right that when the
[39:27] but that when his he was using all this
[39:29] this morning i was thinking man
[39:31] he used the same thing as a whoa he was
[39:33] using these scriptures like this and it
[39:35] uh uh like in other words he said that
[39:38] some scream of christ suffered that when
[39:40] that
[39:41] when his glory shall be revealed that ye
[39:44] may be glad with exceedingly
[39:48] joy
[39:49] well i've got to go through this
[39:51] because christ is locked out until you
[39:53] go through this
[39:54] how there is a proving ground and you're
[39:56] going to be able to stand when the tests
[39:58] come how do you know it never would have
[39:59] been bad hallelujah got thrown in prison
[40:02] for something he did not do right
[40:05] children with the prison for a lie god
[40:08] should have took him out of prison why
[40:10] would god not stand behind it because
[40:12] god had a purpose
[40:14] and god knew that joseph had the right
[40:16] mental attitude toward the word of god
[40:18] even in prison i'm going to serve god
[40:21] honey even in my town i'm going to serve
[40:23] god but he went in prison and god bless
[40:25] the prison right
[40:27] right
[40:28] god in the world so now he says your
[40:31] brother what you tried to say
[40:34] i said you know what suffering do it
[40:36] reveals the true revelation
[40:38] suffering brings out
[40:41] you say that brother
[40:42] i'm preaching something
[40:44] in myself
[40:46] i mean i ain't gonna go around and pray
[40:47] for god to send a trial on me
[40:50] i ain't that dumb
[40:52] if it happened to me then it happened
[40:54] because god seen i have reached the
[40:56] level of maturity i could help it
[40:58] hallelujah but i'm not gonna go before
[40:59] time lord let the devil had a friend he
[41:02] prayed alone he he rejoiced he he was
[41:05] crying out to god god send the devil
[41:07] send the devil to me
[41:09] i think for you as one dumb dude
[41:13] he got what he acts
[41:15] about two months later he was holding
[41:25] i knew what was wrong with it
[41:28] he thought he wanted the devil
[41:30] he better let god make that decision
[41:33] but the point over here when you get to
[41:34] that place god will give you god that's
[41:36] the way god bring out the real you
[41:38] hallelujah he and he say another way to
[41:40] it bring that to real you that you would
[41:42] hey another word we got to have faith
[41:44] how are we going to be a faith in god if
[41:46] we don't go through something right and
[41:48] then when we go through something at the
[41:50] end of the day you look back
[41:52] and you find out that god never left you
[41:54] however when you way down in the valley
[41:56] you look back and you find out that god
[41:58] was standing beside you
[41:59] i'll be with you all the way to the end
[42:01] of the world hallelujah i'll never leave
[42:03] you
[42:04] i'll leave it but we begin to realize
[42:05] him but the problem is
[42:07] he said what kind of disease is in the
[42:09] church i said i said the disease of this
[42:12] age is amnesia
[42:14] spiritual amnesia right people that
[42:16] forgot
[42:18] people been in the message alone i never
[42:19] forgot what god come to do for
[42:22] how do god come to prove to the you that
[42:24] i don't care that we can beat the devil
[42:26] any place anywhere in the ground
[42:29] holly but the point of this amnesia
[42:31] telling us we can't do it right i forgot
[42:33] who i am how did i begin to realize him
[42:37] i'm gonna look at this agent for a
[42:39] minute
[42:40] find out what this edge is here
[42:42] we gotta we got a lot of we got we got
[42:45] by every circumstance
[42:48] it's as far as i'm concerned the full
[42:50] word have been preached
[42:53] until the full word have been preached
[42:56] holy in other words these guys that you
[42:59] find people that even peoples that have
[43:01] come in contact with the message have
[43:04] been able to take this message and make
[43:07] gain out of it because they got enough
[43:09] understanding in the word to preach and
[43:11] actually use that gift pervertedly to
[43:13] bring whatever they want to give look i
[43:15] just left a church in there's a church
[43:17] there's a church down in my town right
[43:19] now a man years ago was gavin they gave
[43:21] the message to this man
[43:23] a brother in our church gave him message
[43:25] books
[43:26] now this guy got a big church
[43:29] teaching them the serpent scene
[43:31] and the godhead right and also letting
[43:33] them have women preachers
[43:36] but what he done he would come in and
[43:37] realize
[43:39] that's that we had something and now
[43:41] he's using it for his glory
[43:44] just what brother wade was saying that a
[43:46] power now this important character is
[43:48] satanic it's not producing character
[43:51] it's producing knowledge and if you
[43:53] don't if they don't let that knowledge
[43:55] become life they're gonna actually
[43:56] condemn them right somebody they'll be
[43:58] going let me just say this so let's go
[44:00] and you look at nicodemus
[44:02] god was locked out
[44:04] when nicodemus met
[44:06] jesus
[44:07] he was locked out
[44:09] because nicodemus if you notice here
[44:11] nicodemus came he said lord
[44:13] he says no man can do these uh miracles
[44:17] except god be with him jesus went right
[44:19] to the new birth
[44:21] he went right to the new birth he's a
[44:23] god locked out of your life right
[44:25] hallelujah your understanding of what
[44:28] you've been taught he said
[44:30] actually god can't get in this
[44:32] he said you must be born again so he
[44:34] carried him to the new birth
[44:36] because he knew if nick and eva don't
[44:38] get born again it'll be impossible for
[44:40] him to stand against the towers that
[44:42] would get rid of faces
[44:43] but we're going to go in here looking
[44:45] i'm going to take another he said but
[44:47] i'm going to look at the excuse of the
[44:49] bride in a second here but the point of
[44:51] it is the bible says here
[44:53] that this suffering that we got
[44:56] that we got to go through this hour
[44:57] right is to do what to bring us to the
[45:00] revelation of obedience glory the bible
[45:03] said jesus learned he obedience by the
[45:06] things he suffered
[45:08] suffering is what teacher how to lean on
[45:11] god and not lean on ourselves all right
[45:14] in other words god if he didn't pull up
[45:16] he'd be don't pull the fire to the nest
[45:18] we're setting the messiness in this rot
[45:22] and all we'll say all our life
[45:24] i'm in the message
[45:25] huh and all you gotta do is believe that
[45:28] believe you're in the mess and you say
[45:29] no you gotta be willing to fight
[45:31] how they don't take the fight out of it
[45:32] but the point over there we got to fight
[45:34] our fighters that we
[45:36] we fighting against today is so uh it's
[45:38] so
[45:39] deceiving the way satan have uh
[45:42] and moved everything around we fight
[45:44] against little things and they call them
[45:47] little foxes
[45:49] little foxes is what we fight against
[45:52] something that seemed like
[45:54] there's really nothing wrong to do this
[45:57] but they'd been done over and over and
[45:59] over and over what does it do it's it's
[46:01] teaching us to lay down our weapons
[46:03] right and not fight right he said
[46:05] brother jewel let's look here let's look
[46:07] at a little fox real quick
[46:10] a little fox here something that was so
[46:12] simple but i said
[46:15] this is one of the strongest
[46:17] manifestation one of the strongest man
[46:19] of the station that i see amongst
[46:21] marriage message people
[46:24] i'm dealing with message people you say
[46:25] bro what you been talking about messing
[46:26] people i'm talking about missing people
[46:29] yeah i'm going to use one of the
[46:30] strongest demons that i find out
[46:32] domestic people use
[46:34] in other words
[46:35] you know it's a it's a it's a it's a way
[46:37] to cop out it's a way to not have to
[46:39] fight it's a way to lay down your weapon
[46:41] and sell them in the message hallelujah
[46:43] but i in other words let us see and know
[46:45] what we want we're going to deal with
[46:46] one of the strongest demons that i
[46:48] believe that that fight against massive
[46:50] people right now and i'm going to use
[46:52] that i'm going to use that up i'm going
[46:53] to use this uh a quote a scripture from
[46:56] the book of uh luke
[46:59] the 14th chapter and verse 17.
[47:03] i'm looking at that message people now
[47:05] we are we right at the time he said i
[47:07] stand at the door or not
[47:09] if any man open the door i'm gonna come
[47:11] in
[47:11] and
[47:12] everything so luke 17 him
[47:15] we finally we find this it's kind of
[47:18] coming to a time that never gonna we
[47:20] we're right at a match supper this is
[47:23] not this is not a this is not a morning
[47:25] meal
[47:26] this is an evening meal
[47:28] this is when the egg got skin on it
[47:31] chicken
[47:34] we right at that boy and then we might
[47:36] hear that he says that and he said unto
[47:39] a certain man and did he say a certain
[47:42] man making a great beast and being many
[47:44] and then he says
[47:46] and he sent
[47:47] and he and
[47:49] sent his servants
[47:55] i mean you know the morning i got up we
[47:57] hunting
[47:58] they i didn't really want no brothers i
[48:00] i got them got me a honey bun
[48:03] but last night buddy it was suppertime
[48:05] right man they throw them ribs on there
[48:08] man i was like wow
[48:10] man you can't be the supper man i don't
[48:12] wanna stop thinking about that let me
[48:13] show preacher
[48:15] i better preach myself hungry
[48:18] let me just leave that alone then the
[48:20] real just keep coming in my mind he says
[48:22] here and he said and it's summertime to
[48:26] say to them to them that that were that
[48:29] were ability to come
[48:30] for all things are what
[48:34] if it's ready that means that they were
[48:36] there the four edge of a full word be
[48:39] restored
[48:40] all things are ready
[48:42] so now this is when all the word is
[48:44] become fully
[48:47] word is ready
[48:49] the sales is open the word will be
[48:51] restored but the point of this the
[48:53] people is not ready for the fight
[48:57] so now we find her
[48:59] in in 18 verses says here and they with
[49:03] one consent begin to say
[49:05] and make what
[49:08] that is one of the most powerful words
[49:11] they've been used around the message
[49:12] everybody got an excuse why they don't
[49:14] serve god
[49:15] some say well i got to get a college
[49:17] degree i got to do this i'm saying well
[49:19] i ain't got time on i'm still young
[49:22] everybody got an excuse why they don't
[49:24] do what everybody got to excuse why they
[49:26] don't well i i would but you see this is
[49:29] that
[49:30] just
[49:31] it was all right you might have got by
[49:33] luther hitch
[49:34] right you might have gone by westlings
[49:37] but you will not get by in this edge
[49:39] right
[49:40] he says here and we make this d my this
[49:43] little word used used in the wrong way
[49:46] now there is circumstances
[49:48] don't get circumstances and excuses
[49:50] mixed up right there might be a
[49:52] circumstance to come up hallelujah that
[49:54] you cannot come and that's what
[49:56] circumstance but excuse me a devil
[49:59] doesn't put in your mind some way to get
[50:01] out of coming right now
[50:03] right don't let it be communion service
[50:05] he showed bring up a lot of excuses
[50:09] because there's a showdown
[50:11] find more excuses made on communion
[50:13] servant at any other time
[50:15] hallelujah but but let me leave that
[50:16] alone but but he says and when one can
[50:19] see it to make excuses
[50:21] the first said unto him
[50:23] i have brought a piece of ground and i
[50:26] must need to go and see it
[50:31] what kind of excuse
[50:32] you gonna do if i buy a piece of ground
[50:35] and i use this i might say this many
[50:37] times before
[50:39] it don't mind if i stay in church all
[50:40] day the ground has never got to be left
[50:43] right
[50:44] what kind of excuse it is and i'm not
[50:45] going to be dabbing the dumb enough to
[50:47] buy a piece of ground ain't seen no way
[50:49] somebody might be selling me a graveyard
[50:53] but people today you know they they buy
[50:55] themselves they didn't think later oh i
[50:57] don't know what i've been doing i'm not
[50:58] here with you they're done you don't
[50:59] actually you know the word that's
[51:01] illness i don't buy nothing i ain't

[51:55] to convince myself he tired

[52:15] his mouth and some white phone was
[52:17] coming out

[52:31] couple bites
[52:32] he laid down
[52:34] i said man eat man eat
[52:36] i gave him some milk and all kinds of
[52:37] stuff he lay down the next morning i

[53:46] excuse
[53:47] me
[53:48] and then he said that no he said pray

[53:52] another said i have brought five yolks
[53:55] of ox
[53:57] and i need to go and prove them
[54:00] i probably need to have me excuse so now
[54:02] this guy right here
[54:06] i see i'm sure you would accept that he
[54:10] is not going to buy no cows he didn't
[54:11] see
[54:13] he gonna probably go out there look at
[54:14] them calories before he buy them cow
[54:16] because he's gonna miss around let you
[54:17] sell him some calories with hard work
[54:20] i mean he get him home right soon to get
[54:22] home he got a bunch of infected cows and
[54:23] they all died overnight

[54:27] suicidal but here we are
[54:31] this guy right here gonna buy yoga cows
[54:33] or yogurt officers and he never even saw
[54:36] them
[54:38] i pray you help me execute everybody
[54:41] gotta excuse why they're not serving god
[54:44] everybody's gonna excuse not to hear the
[54:46] word we find today the problem you
[54:49] people don't wanna hear the word right
[54:52] that's right and another one saying
[54:55] the one that really need to be in church
[54:59] the one that really needs a prayer
[55:02] right
[55:03] and the other one says
[55:05] i have married a wife
[55:09] well you need to get injured as quick as
[55:11] possible
[55:12] cause you're gonna need it
[55:14] because when them test is coming she get
[55:16] to call you a big fat laser slob you
[55:18] better make sure you got tempers yeah
[55:22] yeah anyway because you're going
[55:25] everybody want marriage to be a romance
[55:27] oh he'd come out of the book
[55:30] and he brought me chocolates and and we
[55:32] went off on this big white chair drive
[55:34] and we live happily ever you better wake
[55:36] up
[55:38] it don't work that way in real life all
[55:40] right
[55:41] and she said and he said i am not a wife
[55:45] i'm not even gonna make no excuse
[55:51] i just got married man i'm not coming to
[55:54] church one year later he'll change that
[55:56] attitude right
[55:58] you know you know once the honeymoon
[56:00] right wake up once you what you really
[56:03] realize cause marriage is a test and if
[56:05] you're not willing to fight it won't
[56:07] work right marriage is a test right how
[56:10] do you say now you know what man said
[56:11] your brother i told the mother why i
[56:13] just showed them nothing like that yeah
[56:14] everybody wants every man want a perfect
[56:16] wife and they ask me what is the
[56:18] solution to get a perfect wife i say cut
[56:21] the tongue out
[56:40] she got her opinion she had to look at
[56:42] you there you go to me but the point of
[56:46] it is it's not that way right it's a
[56:48] fight to keep a marriage together it's a
[56:50] fight to keep yourself in the faith it's
[56:53] a fight for you to do whatever you do
[56:54] you might be willing to fight and suffer
[56:57] with christ to be able to do it he
[56:59] didn't win but excuses is the way to not
[57:02] suffer excuses is the way to give up all
[57:04] right
[57:06] i just can't do it myself i'm not
[57:09] willing i'm just gonna let down
[57:11] i'm just gonna i'm not even trying no
[57:13] more that's what kind of excuses coming
[57:15] up in this message and popping up
[57:16] they're all up here but now
[57:20] the danger part is
[57:22] once the word have been fully revealed
[57:25] to this edge
[57:27] you cannot get by with this
[57:29] romans 1 verse 20.
[57:32] want me to see we got too much light to
[57:34] try to use this for the excuse
[57:37] romans 1 verse 20.
[57:39] and they get that one
[57:41] we're gonna see why
[57:43] he says here this is paul speaking here
[57:45] in romans cause everybody got an excuse
[57:47] and they wanted to be excused but this
[57:49] is age you cannot get by with that right
[57:52] it might have worked it in westlings it
[57:54] might have worked in luther but it
[57:55] doesn't work today right
[57:57] he said for the invisible things of him
[57:59] from the creation of the world are
[58:02] clearly what
[58:03] and being under what
[58:06] by things that are made even his his
[58:10] what
[58:12] and what
[58:13] so that daniel went out what
[58:16] that is no excuse now
[58:18] you've got too much word you got too
[58:20] much revelation that try to find a way
[58:22] out right
[58:23] honey you better make sure you gotta
[58:25] it's something to come up that make sure
[58:27] you got it uh
[58:29] a good certain set but not an excuse
[58:33] in other words you know today
[58:35] i say you know people people get sick
[58:38] they get sick and when they're in their
[58:39] hears like this they'll get sick they
[58:42] won't come to church and they'll say
[58:44] well i was sick i would land at home and
[58:47] nobody come by and see me
[58:50] i said your problem is you ain't obeying
[58:52] the scripture
[58:53] don't get mad at brother sam if he
[58:55] didn't come by and see you a brother a
[58:57] brother brother wayne if he didn't come
[58:59] and see you because you ain't done your
[59:00] part right he don't say it for the
[59:03] elders of the church to come to see you
[59:04] it's like for you to call right if you
[59:07] want god if you want the man of god to
[59:09] come and pray for you you need to call
[59:11] him right so he could be in the
[59:12] scripture call for the elders of the
[59:14] church and they know what you do but
[59:16] people won't call right
[59:18] the excuse is they didn't never come and
[59:20] see me i'm quitting this shirt they
[59:21] didn't care about me yeah like the
[59:23] pastor got esp
[59:26] yeah
[59:27] like he know you laying home and people
[59:29] lay home they get a complaint then they
[59:31] get mad at the pastor right well i need
[59:33] it i've been down for months and my
[59:35] pastor didn't come and see me you'll be
[59:37] not for money and you didn't have enough
[59:38] faith to pick up a salvo
[59:42] excuses why we don't serve god right
[59:44] right that's what's been the biggest
[59:46] hindrance in this message now everybody
[59:48] got an excuse why they don't serve god
[59:51] everybody got the excuse why because
[59:52] nobody even willing to fight nobody
[59:54] willing to nobody willing to take go all
[59:56] the way with god and say lord i don't
[59:58] care what my trial is i don't care what
[1:00:00] come my way i'm not letting go of the
[1:00:02] word of god i'm going to fight forever
[1:00:04] in your ground that you gave me
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] amen hallelujah
[1:00:09] i'm going to get look here will you
[1:00:11] brother way use that this morning
[1:00:14] because we're gonna have to go through
[1:00:15] these things people
[1:00:17] in other words
[1:00:20] if we can find some other way easy way
[1:00:23] it would be good
[1:00:25] and we can just wake up in the day
[1:00:28] and it was nothing everything was
[1:00:30] perfect
[1:00:31] man you never had to worry about no more
[1:00:33] trials
[1:00:35] you didn't have to worry about getting
[1:00:36] sick anymore and
[1:00:38] you know that would just be the perfect
[1:00:39] day
[1:00:41] never got gray with blue skies all the
[1:00:44] time
[1:00:45] that would be the perfect day
[1:00:47] oh brother i wish i could have that day
[1:00:50] you will in the millennia
[1:00:52] in a new earth but just it's not the day
[1:00:54] forward right heather you gonna have
[1:00:55] days they're gonna say they're gonna be
[1:00:57] days that we gotta deal with and then we
[1:00:59] and we gotta go through this this great
[1:01:00] amount of a great amount of uh pressure
[1:01:03] in that way so god got something he's
[1:01:05] trying to bring out of us
[1:01:07] hallelujah in other words it got to go
[1:01:08] through this because gold got to be
[1:01:10] trying to do fine how did the show is
[1:01:13] beauty got to go through some pressure
[1:01:15] hallelujah another word so he goes here
[1:01:17] he uses the quotation out of a
[1:01:19] uh uh uh
[1:01:20] the churchill book
[1:01:23] and brother wade read this this morning
[1:01:25] i just already had this wrote down
[1:01:28] how they said we're going to read it
[1:01:29] again
[1:01:30] saying he was dealing with suffering
[1:01:33] because suffering is not
[1:01:35] your enemy
[1:01:37] it brings you to your profession right
[1:01:39] right right see and that we didn't took
[1:01:41] suffering as an enemy yeah holly you
[1:01:43] know some people suffering so long and
[1:01:44] they they feel like well why i suffer so
[1:01:46] bad lord but down on the inside during
[1:01:49] the time you're going through your
[1:01:50] weakest time you find yourself praying
[1:01:52] more
[1:01:54] you find yourself when you're going
[1:01:55] through your greatest trial you're
[1:01:56] calling out to god and you and you and
[1:01:58] you're getting desperate with god how
[1:02:00] did what does god do he's bringing his
[1:02:02] cacti out of you right
[1:02:03] oh yeah stephanie seven i'm just gonna
[1:02:05] throw up the town
[1:02:07] i'm gonna quit the message
[1:02:09] ever since i've been in the mission all
[1:02:11] this hell is against me it folded me
[1:02:12] against you right
[1:02:14] now you're gonna take the devil
[1:02:17] anymore one group of people to death are
[1:02:18] having problem with now
[1:02:20] he hadn't brought with bribe people
[1:02:22] how they got bribed people was trying to
[1:02:23] obey the word and then he realized here
[1:02:26] like brother what he said he do not want
[1:02:28] you to get to your final death your
[1:02:29] adoption that a capstone revelation
[1:02:33] a divine love so you know he won't fight
[1:02:35] you he knows in you right
[1:02:37] but he he knew he knew as you begin to
[1:02:39] realize who you are and then you begin
[1:02:41] to mature in the word and then sooner or
[1:02:47] god got later put you up there right now
[1:02:49] honey brother said i got right here he
[1:02:51] said my god he said go back down he said
[1:02:53] god got to put you up right right man
[1:03:00] now we realize him so he goes on and
[1:03:01] says here
[1:03:03] on page 117 of church of the book
[1:03:06] he read that this morning
[1:03:08] and he was dealing about suffering
[1:03:10] i don't know what paragraph is about the
[1:03:11] miller he said
[1:03:13] unless we all we are
[1:03:15] let me read right here let me see
[1:03:18] let me find my place
[1:03:21] and then he used him
[1:03:24] yeah i didn't remember his why
[1:03:26] does it does he stand by
[1:03:29] the re why you know where to see this
[1:03:30] yeah that's it
[1:03:32] let me go
[1:03:34] i just read right here
[1:03:36] he said
[1:03:37] unless we do what
[1:03:39] right suffer
[1:03:41] a trial
[1:03:42] we all got them right your child might
[1:03:44] not be minds
[1:03:46] my eyes might not be yours but god knows
[1:03:48] what i need to perfect me and he know
[1:03:50] where they need to perfect you
[1:03:52] hallelujah in other words sometimes you
[1:03:53] say well my child what god gave me a
[1:03:55] wife and she always get on my nerves and
[1:03:57] i'm talented living with her and i'm out
[1:03:59] of here no that white might be your
[1:04:01] problem that god put there so you can
[1:04:03] learn to pray right exactly right
[1:04:07] you know what people don't do that the
[1:04:08] most time i'm out of here i'm not
[1:04:09] dealing with this stuff
[1:04:11] that's what you know why because we
[1:04:13] don't want to deal with it right you
[1:04:14] said bro you must have the perfect wife
[1:04:17] well when i first got saved i married
[1:04:19] the baptist
[1:04:20] yeah i come to the messy boy
[1:04:23] it was rough
[1:04:25] but i had to suffer that's right
[1:04:27] she got the holy ghost yes sir buddy we
[1:04:30] went through it buddy it was not only we
[1:04:32] we've been together january 33 years but
[1:04:35] we went through our trials and
[1:04:36] tribulations
[1:04:37] hallelujah because men hud did not see
[1:04:39] eyes on religion how does she feel like
[1:04:42] i'm saved don't matter i'm always safe
[1:04:44] i'll say no you ain't
[1:04:45] look at that world turning and guiding
[1:04:47] lightning and searching for tomorrow
[1:04:49] you've got some problems
[1:05:02] so she gets saved just give her a chance
[1:05:03] let her grow don't do that
[1:05:05] don't do the stupid thing i say i gotta
[1:05:07] say next week i kicked everything out
[1:05:11] those young people don't do that
[1:05:13] that was a stupid mistake
[1:05:15] right hey unless we suffer with him we
[1:05:17] cannot do what right
[1:05:19] and you
[1:05:20] have to do what
[1:05:24] how could god trust a man
[1:05:26] that didn't they hadn't been through a
[1:05:28] trial right right god prove a man in any
[1:05:31] way when god get a man you know if i'm
[1:05:33] gonna if i'm gonna deal with a doctor
[1:05:35] they're going to cut my body open i want
[1:05:37] to make sure i found a doctor that done
[1:05:39] done the surgery
[1:05:41] you ain't going around i'm not going to
[1:05:43] be searching for a man if there's going
[1:05:44] to be a real contingent service surgery
[1:05:47] he's going to do this on my heart or
[1:05:48] something like that i'm not gonna go get
[1:05:50] him he just graduated from college he
[1:05:52] ain't cutting my heart out
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:56] he's not experimenting he better be done
[1:05:57] done it
[1:06:00] you know that's the way people mind him
[1:06:01] because we want somebody that hasn't
[1:06:03] been through it
[1:06:04] somebody that's been under the operating
[1:06:06] pressure of doing this operation and
[1:06:09] been on a
[1:06:10] uh uh when they name doctors there's a
[1:06:12] lot of scratch when they don't operate
[1:06:13] and i've been under the stress of it
[1:06:15] right i want somebody to get in there
[1:06:17] and all of a sudden he said my heart
[1:06:19] landed on the table yeah i can't taste
[1:06:20] it
[1:06:21] nobody
[1:06:22] no you can't give up now
[1:06:25] that's exactly right well that would
[1:06:27] weigh people
[1:06:28] in the words so here and here in the
[1:06:30] world we have to summon the ring that's
[1:06:32] the reason the reason for this
[1:06:35] now the prophet answers the question
[1:06:37] right
[1:06:38] there's a reason for it
[1:06:40] will i be perfected oh yes
[1:06:42] by the time god gets through with you
[1:06:44] by the time you go through your trials
[1:06:46] by the time you have your test is here
[1:06:48] by the time you do it you'll be ready
[1:06:50] yeah all right
[1:06:51] he said he said for the reason the
[1:06:54] the reason for this is that character
[1:06:57] it simply is never without what
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] character is a what right
[1:07:05] a victory
[1:07:07] and not a gift
[1:07:09] a man without character cannot ring
[1:07:12] right because power apart from character
[1:07:15] is what
[1:07:16] we talked about there this morning
[1:07:18] everybody want to be going to church
[1:07:19] everybody want to say that in the
[1:07:21] message but when it's time to prove that
[1:07:23] in the message right why you think
[1:07:25] people walking away now because it's a
[1:07:27] time to prove
[1:07:28] or you're going to stand for jesus or
[1:07:30] you're going to go back to the world
[1:07:32] right that way we found out such a
[1:07:33] falling away today because pressure been
[1:07:35] put down and people were reading all
[1:07:37] kinds of junk off the internet and they
[1:07:39] began to make decisions do reasoning
[1:07:42] i don't know if this message right or
[1:07:43] not
[1:07:44] the point of this you ought to ask
[1:07:46] yourself did you have you received the
[1:07:48] holy ghost since you believed
[1:07:51] had god come into your life and not a
[1:07:53] book a person of jesus christ honey
[1:07:56] they're keeping you from day to day i
[1:07:58] didn't what have the message done for
[1:07:59] you i tried the baptism i tried the
[1:08:02] pentagon that didn't do nothing but when
[1:08:04] i met christ in this message
[1:08:09] i'm not basing it up on brother brandon
[1:08:10] i'm based on the goddess
[1:08:12] hallelujah abrasion upon the goddess
[1:08:15] how did that word anyway it did not it
[1:08:17] changed it did something on the inside
[1:08:19] of me how did it any any what man done
[1:08:22] it's what god has done
[1:08:24] my revelation didn't come by man and
[1:08:26] revelation come through god
[1:08:29] so this year anyway it went out without
[1:08:31] power without the suffering yeah
[1:08:34] i went to god i had to go through a lot
[1:08:36] of trials
[1:08:37] i've seen church splits i've seen this
[1:08:38] happen
[1:08:39] i see men's that i had
[1:08:41] confidence falling backslide oh yeah
[1:08:43] holy things happened in it
[1:08:46] but instead of drawing me away from god
[1:08:48] did they begin to draw me closer to god
[1:08:51] when people begin to turn the mess it
[1:08:53] down and and blaspheme the message on
[1:08:55] the internet and stuff these things did
[1:08:57] not draw me from god
[1:08:59] he they began to draw me closer to god
[1:09:01] because i realized that the word got to
[1:09:03] be crucified again right i realized that
[1:09:05] the word got to be rejected again and
[1:09:07] i'm looking at i'm looking at prophecy
[1:09:09] that people begin to turn the message
[1:09:10] down and begin to blaspheme god honestly
[1:09:13] not the man that's being the holy ghost
[1:09:15] right they deliver the word for this day
[1:09:17] i didn't realize here it's time to go
[1:09:19] home
[1:09:20] amen he said
[1:09:22] but power with character is fit to do
[1:09:24] what
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:27] and since we want to uh say we want us
[1:09:30] to show
[1:09:32] even even his throne on the same basis
[1:09:34] that he overcame overcame what overcame
[1:09:38] the principalities right jesus battle
[1:09:40] was just as much physical as they were
[1:09:42] spiritual he fighted just many
[1:09:44] spiritually with all oil for as many
[1:09:46] spiritual devils and he also fight in
[1:09:48] physical spirits right how does
[1:09:50] suffering have a lot of time we go
[1:09:52] through sickness and we go through
[1:09:53] weakness in our body but some faith on
[1:09:55] the inside keep driving us
[1:09:58] that is not you that keep coming back
[1:10:00] some people you see coming to church
[1:10:02] you'll be thinking why is he still
[1:10:03] coming because that's a power on the
[1:10:05] inside of him
[1:10:07] that has nothing to do with his human
[1:10:08] script that's the power of god that's
[1:10:10] driving him to this right side ain't no
[1:10:13] suffering going to turn him away from
[1:10:14] god hello he says
[1:10:17] jesus overcame to sit down with the
[1:10:18] father is wrong then we
[1:10:20] have overcame and sat down with him
[1:10:23] and then you know in other words these
[1:10:24] things right here that we're going
[1:10:25] through now
[1:10:28] we got we are getting ready to we are
[1:10:30] getting ready to realize here people we
[1:10:31] got to keep we cannot let excuses we got
[1:10:34] to realize here god needs to be unlocked
[1:10:37] harley i want to see god come back with
[1:10:38] the power in his holy ghost how do i
[1:10:41] want to know that god is real in my life
[1:10:43] it's so real holy without a shadow doubt
[1:10:45] hallelujah without any spiritual by any
[1:10:48] trial i go through and i know that god
[1:10:50] is still real
[1:10:52] and if you don't have that revelation
[1:10:54] something wrong with your faith
[1:10:57] we don't done all these things
[1:10:59] what have this message brought us to
[1:11:02] oh yeah oh hell we begin to throw in the
[1:11:04] towel
[1:11:05] because we realize the whole atmosphere
[1:11:08] is filled with devil demonic power
[1:11:11] people's people it's so much depression
[1:11:13] is on this edge
[1:11:15] demons of depression is strong when they
[1:11:17] ever be
[1:11:18] it's just hard to almost even have the
[1:11:20] joy so much depression right i lit half
[1:11:23] of it is the scarecrows and people got
[1:11:25] so many giants out there how do we oh oh
[1:11:27] brother you don't see what's happening
[1:11:29] here oh brother you have you read the
[1:11:31] newspaper have you seen what russia
[1:11:33] gonna do hello oh what are we gonna do
[1:11:35] well i did what i'm gonna do i'm gonna
[1:11:37] try to get myself in a channel with god
[1:11:39] so when the rapture take place i'll be
[1:11:41] ready
[1:11:42] because if i be here when russia drop a
[1:11:44] ball i can miss the rapture right that's
[1:11:46] right hallelujah if we read the message
[1:11:48] and get rid of all this garbage of the
[1:11:50] newspaper so much and believe what god
[1:11:52] said stand saying what the world's
[1:11:53] saying
[1:11:55] we got people still stuck in in the
[1:11:57] media oh yeah oh every time you turn
[1:11:59] around brother sam had you here they
[1:12:01] cannot do nothing
[1:12:03] i think the devil cannot do nothing he
[1:12:05] cannot take god man right until god you
[1:12:08] do with it
[1:12:10] and people are like oh i'm going into
[1:12:12] russia but i'm scared russian gonna drop
[1:12:13] a bomb now either one of the two
[1:12:17] it ain't no something that's a drunk
[1:12:19] sober man
[1:12:20] you either have faith believe you're
[1:12:21] going in the rapture or you ask you're
[1:12:23] just going to get blown up
[1:12:25] that means you're going through the
[1:12:26] tribulation right but i i i'm being by
[1:12:29] god grace as we begin to yield ourselves
[1:12:31] to the word of god god giving us faith
[1:12:34] and confidence that we are triggers of
[1:12:36] god that we will not go through that
[1:12:38] tribulation right i'm not fearing all
[1:12:40] this news stuff yeah that is not my
[1:12:42] battle that's about that's the world
[1:12:44] that's worried about that my mother's
[1:12:46] not i'm already sealed in christ i got
[1:12:48] the holy ghost and my holy ghost is
[1:12:49] giving me covenant that i by rapture
[1:12:52] faith we will be there

[1:15:21] room
[1:15:22] but back
[1:15:30] satan is desensitizing the people right
[1:15:32] to softness that they won't know how to
[1:15:35] you know they don't want want to get out
[1:15:36] no more right
