[32:43] have some gifts given out and
[32:45] and uh
[32:47] honor the church by giving you a dinner
[32:49] down at Hidden Acres so when we get
[32:51] finished with this service
[32:53] which will be pretty short now and
[32:55] that's okay because I only got
[32:57] um one thing I'd like to to bring out to
[33:00] you and uh if if if Bob will quit
[33:04] preaching my sermons
[33:06] we'll just uh
[33:08] we'll just the way the Lord works though
[33:10] because we don't call each other
[33:12] and talk about it but uh
[33:14] I was thinking on this as he was showing
[33:17] the the history behind it but
[33:20] I was thinking more on the line of
[33:22] there was a guy stood up one day and he
[33:24] looked at the Lord Jesus and he said
[33:26] what is truth
[33:29] it was a question
[33:31] pilate was perplexed he said what is
[33:33] truth
[33:35] Jesus had already said many many months
[33:37] before I am the way the truth and the
[33:39] life of pilate didn't hear that pilate
[33:40] wasn't there
[33:42] but what is truth that's what we're
[33:44] going to talk about today
[33:46] um for just a moment remember brother
[33:48] Louise will be speaking for us Wednesday
[33:50] night
[33:52] get some of these announcements out of
[33:53] the way uh remember the prayer service
[33:55] will be this coming Saturday at seven
[33:59] o'clock
[34:01] coming we're just going to pray we're
[34:03] not going to like I said we're not gonna
[34:04] have any Fellowship uh coffee you know
[34:07] we're just going to come and pray we'll
[34:08] open the doors and have soft music on
[34:11] and background music and then you just
[34:13] pray in your own way and everyone is
[34:16] welcome to come
[34:18] I believe that's why we're having good
[34:20] Services is because the Lord is pleased
[34:23] that we're taking out a moment of time
[34:25] to come and pray sure you can pray at
[34:28] home you can pray in your car you can
[34:30] pray anywhere else but you make an
[34:31] effort to come here
[34:32] I believe the Lord to give you a little
[34:34] extra something special all right that's
[34:36] just how I believe it and we'll be
[34:38] praying for the watch night meeting
[34:39] which will be
[34:41] the 30th and 31st we'll have a Friday
[34:44] night service at seven o'clock brother
[34:46] Wayne Lawson will be here and a Saturday
[34:48] night at eight o'clock it'll be our
[34:49] regular what's not service and we'll be
[34:52] letting you know a little bit more about
[34:53] what to bring as far as finger food and
[34:55] things that we'll have before and after
[34:58] the service we'll just keep that in your
[35:00] prayer also remember February the 11th
[35:03] keep that on your calendar that will be
[35:04] our annual
[35:07] um
[35:08] Valentine's banquet I can't remember how
[35:10] many years I'm sure brother Joe and some
[35:11] of them could could find that out how
[35:13] many years we've had this thing and and
[35:16] all of you remember last year we almost
[35:18] got snowed in
[35:19] uh it was a three or four inches of snow
[35:22] before we got ready to leave so uh but
[35:24] that's all right everybody made home and
[35:26] safe but we'll be announcing that more
[35:28] but just put on your calendar February
[35:30] the 11th
[35:31] and we're going to do it a little bit
[35:32] different this year like I said before
[35:34] we're going to open it up where that if
[35:37] you are a couple then you can bring a
[35:40] couple with you
[35:42] they don't have to be believers
[35:45] they don't need to be drunks
[35:47] but I believe we ought to be as a church
[35:50] we ought to be an Outreach
[35:52] we ought to be able to bring the
[35:54] community or your we saw that in Ohio I
[35:57] know they're watching in now
[36:01] but it it softened up their in-laws that
[36:04] were really hard-hearted about the
[36:06] message
[36:06] because they saw love
[36:09] projected in you that went
[36:11] they had not seen it before they saw it
[36:13] and you that went
[36:14] all right so they didn't see it from
[36:15] somewhere else they saw it from you
[36:17] so we're going to project that a little
[36:19] bit further because all of them are
[36:20] coming down from Ohio plus the
[36:23] um the in-laws on one side and we're
[36:24] trying to work on the other ones but
[36:26] we're going to open it up to where say
[36:28] June and I can bring a couple with us
[36:32] and they got to be a couple and they got
[36:33] to be married
[36:35] and uh
[36:36] and we'll have a
[36:38] a good time in the Lord and and I'm
[36:41] still praying about it and I may have a
[36:43] a guest speaker just speak for maybe 20
[36:45] or 30 minutes and then we will have some
[36:48] fun like we always do we'll always have
[36:51] our games and prizes and and Freda and
[36:54] Paul will be able to come my goodness
[36:56] coach and um
[36:58] Lily and Zach we got some extras coming
[37:01] who knows it's February you never know
[37:04] between now and then
[37:06] oh anyway
[37:08] so just keep that in prayer
[37:10] did you have your hand up to me what you
[37:13] need
[37:15] sure come around
[37:26] y'all have to excuse me I do not like
[37:28] speaking in public
[37:30] um it was just on my heart last night
[37:32] and this morning
[37:34] to say thank you
[37:36] to God and to this church
[37:40] um when my dad died
[37:42] at the end of 2020
[37:45] I had nothing I felt like I was empty
[37:48] like my emotions were completely gone
[37:50] like I was a desert inside
[37:54] so I had started coming to church every
[37:58] other weekend driving here from

[39:22] that I am getting a promotion in a huge
[39:26] race
[39:27] [Applause]
[39:31] so I want to thank God for that
[39:35] I lived in Tennessee for a long time
[39:37] that place it became comfortable it
[39:40] became convenient it's where my mom and
[39:42] my sister is and some other my family
[39:44] when I moved here I missed a lot about
[39:47] Lebanon a lot
[39:50] and every time it gets to the point
[39:52] where I start second guessing where I
[39:54] should that I should be here or not
[39:57] somebody in this Pulpit always says put
[40:00] God first God has to be first every time
[40:03] and every time I hear that statement
[40:05] that goes away that feeling of second
[40:09] guessing whether I should be in Georgia
[40:11] or not goes away instantly because this
[40:15] is the church where I feel where I get
[40:17] fed
[40:19] I have been to other churches and I
[40:21] enjoy the services greatly every church
[40:23] I've ever visited but this is a church
[40:26] where I feel like I get fed by the word
[40:28] and where I get fed emotionally
[40:32] from you all
[40:35] so I just want to thank you all every
[40:37] single one of you to for being such a
[40:40] huge huge wonderful church family
[40:44] and I also want to thank God for healing
[40:47] my mother yes
[40:52] thank you
[40:53] there is one thing that God is still has
[40:56] to
[40:57] show to the world I I know that they say
[41:01] there's something still wrong with her
[41:02] but I'm just waiting for it to manifest
[41:04] but God says
[41:06] everybody we're already healed so I'm
[41:08] just waiting for that one thing to be
[41:10] finely manifested for dinner
[41:12] and I want to thank God also for healing
[41:16] my brother-in-law
[41:18] he was his heart was very very bad very
[41:21] very bad and not only did he get to take
[41:24] his monitor off his heart they're no
[41:27] longer saying surgery
[41:29] he just has to they said purely by diet
[41:32] he can he'll be fine so I just wanted to
[41:36] thank God for that too and there's
[41:38] probably one other thing I meant to say
[41:40] but look at it all y'all stared at me
[41:43] I'm nervous how about your house looking
[41:46] oh yeah that
[41:48] I it's not mine yet but I found I looked
[41:52] at a little house yesterday that was
[41:54] so cute in its perfect size perfect
[41:57] place to live I just I'm waiting for God
[41:59] to say yes that's yours or no that's not
[42:02] quite what I want you claim it so I'm
[42:05] hoping I'm praying that it's mine but
[42:08] I'm also saying it's God's Will and
[42:10] God's Will has to come first above my I
[42:12] won't that's right but I am saying God
[42:16] if this is your wheel I'm ready for it
[42:18] this is what I want but anyway I want to
[42:21] say thank you all I appreciate every one
[42:23] of you and I thank God greatly for
[42:25] putting me here where I'm supposed to be
[42:27] amen
[42:35] amen you believe that man I think we all
[42:38] have a testimony pretty much like that
[42:39] too so we pray for sister Janine and the
[42:43] family there and I know they missed
[42:45] their dad he was a wonderful guy but uh

[43:38] to guide us into all truth in Jesus name
[43:40] we pray amen let's read this real quick
[43:42] and you'll be seated uh we're still on
[43:44] hoods the son of man but I kind of
[43:45] wanted to me and the Lord were chuckling
[43:47] yesterday and uh yeah I believe he has a
[43:50] sense of humor and yeah thank you
[43:52] brother I think he does too
[43:55] and I'm gonna we're gonna talk about
[43:56] truth today
[43:59] just interject a little bit about truth
[44:01] but this time of the year
[44:04] is the most lying time
[44:08] untrue time
[44:10] you'll ever see and we'll look at that
[44:11] in just a minute so
[44:13] in the beginning was the word words with
[44:14] God the Word was God and the Word was
[44:16] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[44:18] beheld the glory the glory was only
[44:19] begotten of the father look full of
[44:20] grace and what truth all right so let's
[44:23] read Psalms 85 10. the Bible says mercy
[44:26] and Truth are met together
[44:28] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[44:31] other
[44:32] truth shall spring out of the earth what
[44:34] Earth down here no earth right here all
[44:37] right everybody with me truth shall
[44:39] spring out of the earth and
[44:40] righteousness shall look down from
[44:42] heaven you may be seated O Lord that is
[44:45] blessing to the reading of the word now
[44:46] we've been talking about the Statue of a
[44:48] perfect man but I was thinking yesterday
[44:52] and talking to the Lord a little bit
[44:53] about truth because you you look and you
[44:55] see you know you have phrases like
[44:57] Moment of Truth and and it ain't nothing
[45:00] but the truth and and you hear all that
[45:02] and like I said before it was chuckling
[45:04] yesterday I mean this time of the year
[45:06] we've got a man that flies
[45:11] all over the world at the same time
[45:14] delivering presents
[45:17] in a sleigh that flying reindeers Drive
[45:21] and one of them's got red nose
[45:25] we laugh but that's what you taught your
[45:27] kids
[45:29] we try to keep them from lying but we
[45:32] tell them the biggest lie as soon as
[45:33] they're born and growing up uh we have
[45:36] deer that fly we have snowmen that come
[45:39] to life and talk
[45:45] and and frosty goes away and comes back
[45:47] next year
[45:50] have you ever thought about the
[45:51] silliness of that we're laughing today
[45:53] but 99 of us older ones
[45:57] have told our kids the same thing right
[45:59] we told them an untruth and this world
[46:02] is full of untruth but there is one
[46:05] truth and it shall spring out of the
[46:07] earth that's what I want to talk about
[46:08] just for a few minutes today
[46:10] because what brought me to that point is
[46:14] is someone called me the other day and
[46:16] we were talking about something and and
[46:18] what it was was a doctrine that this
[46:21] Minister had just you know sold his soul
[46:24] on and and preached it for years and
[46:27] years and and and and and now that you
[46:29] came here with eternal life that you
[46:31] came here with a seed inside of you and
[46:33] you were always Eternal and you never
[46:35] were lost and all that and then about
[46:37] two weeks ago he got a revelation
[46:42] he said well it could be the other way
[46:48] it could be the other way well now
[46:50] you've you've built your foundation and
[46:52] everything that's why I said about when
[46:54] we when we go out into the world and we
[46:56] talk to people and we and we give them
[46:59] the gospel listen give them the gospel
[47:01] give them the truth of Jesus Christ
[47:02] first but there is a part of the message
[47:04] that sometimes they're asking well why
[47:06] you do this and why you do are you going
[47:07] to tell them well I know you're gonna
[47:08] tell them the truth amen
[47:10] and if it's contrary to their truth come
[47:13] on they get ill so do you
[47:17] if I preach a doctrine that you don't
[47:19] like you get ill
[47:21] you the person get ill yeah
[47:24] now if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy
[47:26] Ghost doesn't get ill
[47:28] but you get ill that's why we talk about
[47:30] the memories and conscious face and
[47:31] Imagination you go back on your what on
[47:33] your past
[47:35] but I want to read you something
[47:37] and it came from a man named M Richard
[47:41] Oliver
[47:43] listen to this
[47:46] letting people be wrong about you are a
[47:50] situation
[47:52] false Doctrine while keeping your peace
[47:56] and focus
[47:58] is the most
[48:00] misunderstood power move that you will
[48:03] ever make
[48:05] let me break that down one more time
[48:07] letting people be wrong about you
[48:11] like that brother with the false
[48:13] Doctrine he kicked people out of church
[48:15] he didn't want to fellowship with people
[48:16] and we've done the same thing in the
[48:18] past Maybe
[48:19] but letting people be wrong about you or
[48:22] a situation while keeping your peace in
[48:25] focus
[48:26] focus on the truth
[48:28] instead of trying to go back and
[48:31] in other words jump into his pit and try
[48:33] to straighten him out
[48:35] right but Focus your peace and focus is
[48:38] the most misunderstood power move you'll
[48:41] ever make
[48:42] because what's happening is we've got a
[48:44] group of people that left the church
[48:47] we've got groups of people I don't know
[48:48] some left here because the doctor no not
[48:51] because I think we preach pretty much
[48:52] the truth all the truth
[48:55] but we have some of you left other
[48:56] churches that come here because of a
[48:58] Doctrine right
[49:00] but I hope we're to the point to where
[49:03] we know one thing's for sure
[49:06] if it's truth
[49:08] it will always prevail
[49:10] if it's truth it will always Prevail it
[49:13] doesn't matter if you've got 75 listen
[49:16] Jesus was what the way the truth and the
[49:19] life amen he was hated
[49:22] by the whole world
[49:25] hated
[49:27] because it was the truth he didn't just
[49:29] tell the truth he was the truth and if
[49:31] you got him inside of you what does that
[49:33] make you
[49:34] truth shall spring out of the earth your
[49:37] Earth but when you come to truth and you
[49:40] stand there like this quote says you
[49:42] stand there and you focus and have peace
[49:44] in what you are amen amen you're
[49:46] standing in the truth guess what if
[49:49] they're a child of God I say they with
[49:51] false Doctrine folks that are untrue
[49:54] guess what
[49:56] they'll come around
[49:58] because because God's people's always
[50:01] got to come to truth
[50:03] if you're a child of God you will come
[50:04] to truth it doesn't matter what but but
[50:06] don't get so muddled up to say I'm the
[50:08] only one didn't Elijah do that one day
[50:11] Elijah said look for it wow I'm the only
[50:14] one
[50:14] bound to bail
[50:16] lord said hang on a minute Elijah
[50:19] I got about 7 000 in some other cities
[50:22] that you don't know about they're
[50:24] children of mine too and I said that he
[50:26] said they just believe the same thing
[50:27] you believe
[50:29] they just weren't right there where
[50:30] Elijah could get on Facebook and contact
[50:32] them
[50:33] our column or whatever you want to say
[50:35] social media I can't get away from
[50:37] social media everything's on social
[50:39] media now
[50:40] but uh and they use it for a Pulpit
[50:42] which I hate but there's nothing you do
[50:44] about but keep your peace and focus in
[50:46] that time that you think you think that
[50:49] you have the whole world's against you
[50:51] listen the whole world's against this
[50:53] message didn't they tell Martin Luther
[50:55] said Martin Luther the whole world's
[50:57] against you he said tell the whole world
[51:00] I'm against them
[51:02] because if you're against the truth if
[51:05] you are the truth the way the truth and
[51:07] the life if this message and I'll read
[51:09] it to you in a little while if this
[51:10] message is the truth there's none other
[51:12] that's
[51:14] right there's none other that's right
[51:15] right it's false listen you and I were
[51:18] born on a lie
[51:21] right right every one of us were born on
[51:24] a lie
[51:26] well I told several thousand years ago
[51:29] to a woman in a garden that's right
[51:31] it was a lie
[51:32] there was some truth in it but it was a
[51:35] lie
[51:36] that you're born by that's why you have
[51:38] to be born again and then what become
[51:41] truth
[51:42] if Jesus says I am the way the truth and
[51:44] the life we've got to come to that yes
[51:48] listen to this
[51:51] I want to read them in just a few
[51:53] minutes I'll read a uh
[51:55] a definition because the definition of
[51:59] Truth has a lot to do with faith
[52:03] because they go together
[52:05] amen faithfulness and truth faith and
[52:07] Truth they all go together all right
[52:09] because listen you got to have faith in
[52:11] what you believe that's right
[52:13] that's right all right so listen listen
[52:15] so what happens is here in June we've
[52:17] been reading this before but it kind of
[52:18] struck me again that you should honestly
[52:21] and what for the truth
[52:23] am I changing the Bible no earnestly
[52:26] content for the truth which was once
[52:28] delivered unto the Saints the truth of
[52:31] the what of the first church age no
[52:34] false Doctrine but look what happens
[52:36] certain men come in what unawares
[52:38] telling untruth
[52:40] are killing lies Paul even called him
[52:44] Fables
[52:45] men preaching Fables
[52:48] Santa Claus
[52:50] Mr Bunny
[52:53] think about it ungodly men
[52:57] but not ungodly man is dragging you off
[52:59] to the Beer Joint
[53:01] he's teaching an untruth in the Pulpit
[53:04] right
[53:05] because he turns look turning the grace
[53:07] of our God into lasciviousness and
[53:10] denying the only Lord God in our Lord
[53:12] Jesus Christ
[53:13] second Timothy 2 4 15 says study to show
[53:16] yourself approved
[53:17] amen unto God a Workman that needeth not
[53:19] to be ashamed what rightly dividing the
[53:22] word of Truth amen
[53:24] amen rightly dividing today you're going
[53:26] to divide whether this is truth or not
[53:28] right all right
[53:30] now Jesus said my words there what truth
[53:32] and life
[53:34] so if we preach the word to you today
[53:36] that's truth in this life yes yes
[53:38] everybody with me on that
[53:40] but just understand listen we live in a
[53:43] world of lives we know that we were born
[53:45] alive we tell our kids allow our kids
[53:47] tell us Lies We lie to everybody and
[53:49] everybody everybody lies to us I know we
[53:50] don't as much as Believers but 99 of
[53:53] everybody else are they gonna lie
[53:56] right oh don't get quiet on me
[53:58] yeah no they gonna lie
[54:03] but why
[54:04] Jesus told him said you're of your
[54:06] father the devil and he said the truth
[54:09] is not in you
[54:11] the truth is not in you that's why you
[54:14] lie
[54:15] listen this right here the word truth in
[54:17] Hebrew the Hebrew lexicon when you see
[54:19] the word truth in the Bible this is what
[54:21] it means isn't it the word truth is in
[54:23] the Bible 271 times all right starting
[54:26] back in Genesis all the way to Jesus's
[54:29] time and on into Peter
[54:31] firmness
[54:33] faithfulness
[54:35] sureness reliability
[54:38] stability
[54:40] continuance
[54:41] now you think back on on what today
[54:44] every one of you sitting here today has
[54:46] some basis of truth in your head right
[54:48] now
[54:49] I'm sorry your truth in your head right
[54:51] now may not be the truth but it will be
[54:54] maybe some semblance of Truth well I
[54:56] don't think this I don't think that well
[54:58] when we're not talking about your
[54:59] thoughts we're talking about what
[55:01] something stable I remember you know I
[55:03] read the scripture to you several times
[55:06] in the last few weeks that a
[55:07] double-minded man is unstable
[55:10] in what in his word or in true he's
[55:13] unstable he don't know what to believe
[55:15] he believes this one day believes this
[55:16] another day
[55:18] that's right we've got to come to one
[55:21] truth amen not two not three one truth
[55:24] amen
[55:26] that's why if we get Jesus Christ in our
[55:28] heart that'll boy that'll help a lot to
[55:31] get you to the truth because he is the
[55:33] truth but look faithfulness and
[55:36] reliableness
[55:40] there's not many liars that I trust
[55:44] well that hurt everybody's feeling there
[55:47] no I don't trust a liar right you can't
[55:50] cause you don't know what he's telling
[55:52] you maybe he'll laugh and you know what
[55:54] a lie is wrong
[55:58] but reliableness faithfulness
[56:01] you take a pastor like brother Dale
[56:02] stood here for 50 years we relied on him
[56:07] to teach us the truth
[56:09] amen we rely on the ministry to teach us
[56:12] truth we don't rely on the drunk to
[56:14] teach us truth we don't rely on The
[56:17] Neighbor Next Door if he's not born
[56:19] again to teach you the truth
[56:21] he can't because Jesus said the truth's
[56:23] not in you
[56:26] let's go to Proverbs 16 verse 6. just
[56:29] for a moment like I said we'll get done
[56:30] about 11 45 and we'll head on down to
[56:32] the Hidden Acres some of you are new
[56:35] that hadn't been it wasn't here last
[56:36] year
[56:37] um going to the Hidden Acres just follow
[56:39] somebody it's only about eight miles
[56:40] just follow somebody and they'll get you
[56:43] there because 99 of you has been there
[56:46] but we got a few new ones and we sure
[56:47] appreciate that we appreciate God
[56:49] sending us some some good young people
[56:51] and some and some good old people
[56:57] Terence was going
[57:00] we'll wait on you brother Connor
[57:01] told you not to be running in the
[57:03] hallway
[57:06] brother
[57:08] step back under
[57:10] a little faster than he does now
[57:13] but you know what
[57:15] the truth came through the door
[57:19] that was true you saw truth walking in
[57:21] the door they've been faithful him and
[57:23] brother Doherty's been faithful the rest
[57:25] of you may have been but I'm telling you
[57:26] brother Kylie and brother Doherty has
[57:28] been just absolute pillars in this
[57:31] church amen come here Sid
[57:37] brother Doherty's wife can't make it to
[57:39] church but the collie's wife passed away
[57:40] several years ago you know what that'd
[57:42] been a real good excuse not to come to
[57:45] church guess what they come to church
[57:47] and they're in their
[57:49] late 70s now
[57:53] and they just drive right on an hour and
[57:55] a half to church shame on you people
[57:56] that can't drive 15 minutes to get to
[57:58] church that's right
[58:00] I'll say Amen myself
[58:02] Proverbs 16 Verse 6 is look by Mercy and
[58:04] Truth watch iniquity is purged
[58:08] by Mercy and true truth will drive out
[58:11] iniquity now what the Bible tell us
[58:14] about iniquity in this age in this last
[58:17] time iniquity shall what abound
[58:20] and the love of many shall wax cold why
[58:23] they don't know I and and forgive me but
[58:28] it's the only way I can preach yesterday
[58:30] we had a a little Christmas thing at
[58:32] Gillsville at the town and uh yeah we
[58:35] have Santa Claus but uh that was a that
[58:38] was a pastor there from another from a
[58:41] Baptist Church and I was going to have
[58:43] him pray when he came in and well he
[58:45] comes in and he's got this big
[58:48] yeah why did you in the back in his
[58:52] mouth
[58:53] and I started not to but I had already
[58:55] asked the brother I said where's your
[58:56] pastor and he said well he's right there
[58:58] I can tell
[58:59] he's just like somebody working on a
[59:01] farm a little backer in his mouth you
[59:03] know
[59:04] but you see that and then he stands in
[59:06] the pulpit and preaches the gospel now
[59:08] we all have faults and failures but
[59:10] that's a sure sign that if I look at it
[59:12] and you looked at it
[59:16] there's something he needs to overcome
[59:19] right he hasn't overcome the world yet
[59:22] amen
[59:24] so that's what we but see we look at it
[59:26] and maybe his truth
[59:28] come on somebody maybe his truth said
[59:30] it's okay right
[59:32] right the people that run the restaurant
[59:33] they went to a baptism yesterday closed
[59:35] the restaurant their Catholics they went
[59:37] to on the little sprinkling things
[59:40] because listen in a Catholic Church
[59:42] Rosanna in a Catholic church if your
[59:45] baby's not baptized it goes to hell
[59:47] right right if that baby dies
[59:50] it goes to hell
[59:53] don't pass gold no collecting on 200 if
[59:56] you're not sprinkled that's why they get
[59:57] them as quick as they can they take them
[59:58] to the priest and have them sprinkled or
[1:00:00] whatever they do but you know what
[1:00:02] though they took that as truth
[1:00:05] the nice and Council took everything
[1:00:07] they had as truth and man has walked in
[1:00:10] that for years right that's why we had
[1:00:13] to have somebody to turn us back to the
[1:00:16] truth the truth of the Saints
[1:00:19] of the first church age and thank God
[1:00:22] you and I are recipients of that today
[1:00:25] amen the world is not recipients of this
[1:00:28] you and I recipients of this
[1:00:31] by Mercy and Truth iniquity is Persian
[1:00:34] by the fear of the Lord
[1:00:35] men depart from evil
[1:00:38] John 1 14 we read it just I'll read it
[1:00:40] all the time look the word was made
[1:00:42] flesh look full of grace and truth that
[1:00:45] should be me and you if you've got the
[1:00:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost full of grace
[1:00:48] and truth
[1:00:51] John 1 verse 17 and we'll read you a
[1:00:53] quote here in just a few minutes but you
[1:00:55] take a minister of the Gospel like
[1:00:56] brother Dale in different ones the
[1:00:58] ministers here that are preaching the
[1:01:00] truth and and they have a responsibility
[1:01:04] Beyond any other Baptist Methodist
[1:01:06] Pentecostal whatever and most of the
[1:01:08] people in The Met they have they have a
[1:01:09] responsibility to teach you the truth
[1:01:11] right because what that truth is going
[1:01:13] to do is what what's the truth is going
[1:01:14] to do when it comes to you I'm sitting
[1:01:16] back there with you now the truth is
[1:01:17] going to set you free
[1:01:20] it's not going to bind you that's why
[1:01:22] when people look at the message out they
[1:01:24] say oh your people
[1:01:28] this man you got to wear your hair long
[1:01:31] and you gotta wear your dress is long
[1:01:34] what do you mean you can't wear pants
[1:01:37] they wear pants and shorts to church now
[1:01:39] so
[1:01:40] I mean come on
[1:01:42] but we don't
[1:01:45] but they're saying you're not in the
[1:01:47] truth
[1:01:48] there's got to be a separation somewhere
[1:01:51] but there is like I said before we've
[1:01:53] got to establish a truth
[1:01:56] and say this is it yeah
[1:01:58] yeah we gotta establish the truth look
[1:01:59] for the law was given by Moses but Grace
[1:02:03] and Truth came by Jesus Christ you got
[1:02:06] to mix that Grace and Truth together
[1:02:07] everybody with me on that get here real
[1:02:09] quick John 4 verse 23 said but the hour
[1:02:12] coming and now is when the true look
[1:02:15] when the true worshipers
[1:02:18] all right so that excludes
[1:02:22] the non-truth worshipers
[1:02:24] I'm reading you the Bible I'm not
[1:02:25] discluding people the Bible remember
[1:02:27] what brother Brown said he said Jesus he
[1:02:30] said God is a segregationist amen amen
[1:02:33] God says get away from that thing
[1:02:37] it's the devil
[1:02:39] but the hour cometh and now is with the
[1:02:41] true worshiper shall worship the father
[1:02:43] in spirit and in truth now this is Jesus
[1:02:46] talking
[1:02:47] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:02:50] him he goes and looks for a good
[1:02:53] congregation that'll worship him that'll
[1:02:55] sing a song like we just heard a few
[1:02:56] minutes ago and everybody said oh that's
[1:02:59] me that's my God
[1:03:01] he moves them unmovable
[1:03:06] God is the spirit and they that worship
[1:03:09] Him must worship him and what Spirit
[1:03:11] everything is connected to truth you
[1:03:14] can't say just worship Him in spirit
[1:03:17] because remember power without character
[1:03:21] see this offense right in with the
[1:03:22] Statue perfect man power without
[1:03:23] character is satanic amen but when you
[1:03:26] take the spirit and you put it in Truth
[1:03:29] it's got to be right that's right well I
[1:03:32] don't know if it's right or not you
[1:03:34] better get in the altar somewhere
[1:03:37] because I'm gonna read you a quote here
[1:03:39] in a few minutes
[1:03:41] and remember one more time truth always
[1:03:44] prevails amen I don't care who it's
[1:03:46] coming from truth will always Prevail
[1:03:49] over non-truth you just gotta stand
[1:03:52] there and hold it you got to stand there
[1:03:54] with some patience and some knowledge
[1:03:56] and some Temperance to know that that
[1:03:58] brother is an error and you don't go out
[1:04:00] and lambaste him you pray for it that's
[1:04:03] brotherly kindness you pray for the
[1:04:04] person that's right and guess what a few
[1:04:07] months later God May soften his heart up
[1:04:09] and he'll come back and say
[1:04:11] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:04:12] folks
[1:04:13] there's one truth that we have in this
[1:04:16] church that a lot of people don't have
[1:04:17] and that's the truth of that in 70 weeks
[1:04:20] now some of you may not understand it
[1:04:21] but that's okay there is a there is a
[1:04:24] truth of Daniel 70 wheels and and most
[1:04:27] people 99 of the people in this message
[1:04:29] do not have it
[1:04:32] I hear ministers say man some of you may
[1:04:34] not know that but I'm just telling you
[1:04:36] if you've been in Minister's meetings
[1:04:38] and you've been to brother Colleen's
[1:04:39] been doing way back long y'all were
[1:04:41] talking about this 40 years ago amen and
[1:04:44] what did they do then they ostracized
[1:04:46] you they cut you off and say ah you're
[1:04:48] false yeah amen oh that ain't true that
[1:04:51] ain't what he said
[1:04:53] you just hang on though yeah
[1:04:55] yeah just hang on brother Claude
[1:04:57] weisinger when I started going out there
[1:04:58] a lot preaching brother Josh was still
[1:05:00] alive brother Jeff said brother white
[1:05:02] said I said come out here and preach us
[1:05:06] I think we had a Friday Saturday and
[1:05:09] Sunday he said now he's at the pastor
[1:05:11] come he didn't say Daniel 70 weeks but
[1:05:13] he said come out here and preach us a
[1:05:15] Doctrine preach us something teach us
[1:05:17] for three days pick a topic oh buddy I
[1:05:20] picked Daniel 7 weeks
[1:05:24] what y'all do that for
[1:05:27] mine
[1:05:31] go to the contention in the message
[1:05:33] about Daniel 70 ways brother Noel
[1:05:36] Johnson's he says that's a shin kicker
[1:05:38] you understand what I mean you know
[1:05:39] under the table kick somebody in his
[1:05:41] chin that ain't right
[1:05:42] so I went out there for three days and I
[1:05:45] poured my heart out I gave them the
[1:05:46] charts I read them the message I read
[1:05:49] them the Bible
[1:05:52] and and I got some feedback
[1:05:57] No Rotten Tomatoes
[1:05:59] but I got some feedback
[1:06:01] brother Jeff said he really didn't
[1:06:03] understand it
[1:06:05] brother Claude said that ain't right
[1:06:09] and one of the deacons wrote me a long
[1:06:10] letter that ain't right
[1:06:12] I said okay prove it to me well brother
[1:06:14] Brown said I said hold on a minute one
[1:06:16] more time the Bible's right
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:22] what is the truth the Bible's the truth
[1:06:25] you got to make that quote that seems
[1:06:28] wrong match the Bible
[1:06:31] and the Bible says that there's
[1:06:34] after the Antichrist puts out a contract
[1:06:38] there's one we left
[1:06:41] and I even told him I said I really
[1:06:43] don't care about my brother I'm saying
[1:06:46] because you're making him say something
[1:06:47] false yeah right
[1:06:49] that's not what he's talking about amen
[1:06:51] you're not understanding that weak he's
[1:06:53] talking about because he can't change
[1:06:55] the Bible that's right man but then I
[1:06:57] kept talking brother Claude he kept
[1:06:59] calling me and I kept talking to him
[1:07:00] kept talking to that Deacon and we'd go
[1:07:02] you know I remember I was going out
[1:07:03] there about it for two weeks when they
[1:07:05] were you know looking for me to be the
[1:07:06] pastor or something oh a long time ago
[1:07:09] but um I'd go out there for two weeks
[1:07:11] and boy that's the first thing I get off
[1:07:13] the airplane
[1:07:14] clark'll be going all right I've been
[1:07:16] studying this what does this mean right
[1:07:18] here well now let me just get skip to
[1:07:20] the end of the story the end of the
[1:07:22] story is
[1:07:23] he understands it just as clear as a
[1:07:25] vowel
[1:07:28] I waited on him to come to the truth
[1:07:33] I let him ask the question and the
[1:07:36] Deacon asked the questions and then once
[1:07:39] it all cleared up they said well they're
[1:07:40] like Haley Wright well that ain't
[1:07:41] nothing but the truth
[1:07:43] see that's bringing athletic truth
[1:07:46] habits work let truth have its day but
[1:07:49] it may not be the first day
[1:07:51] it was several maybe months before
[1:07:55] they come to the truth when I see Claude
[1:07:58] understands that the the Deacon
[1:08:00] understands it but now people can't
[1:08:01] understand when Claude preaches it yeah
[1:08:03] so
[1:08:06] listen you're not going to understand
[1:08:07] something if you don't want to right
[1:08:10] you just cut yourself off and you'll not
[1:08:12] understand it you know that's for the
[1:08:15] Jews it's not for us well it does have
[1:08:17] something to do with your Redemption
[1:08:19] right hey man amen and the truth of that
[1:08:22] Redemption so so what am I saying is if
[1:08:24] somebody has something against you even
[1:08:26] like brother Dale 1970
[1:08:29] before he preaches to Daniel 70 weeks or
[1:08:31] 71.
[1:08:34] 74.
[1:08:36] 74. he preaches Daniel 70 waves proves
[1:08:40] that we could go past 1977. hold my word
[1:08:44] huh
[1:08:47] Antichrist
[1:08:48] you're going against brother random I
[1:08:50] have a quote
[1:08:52] well are we still here
[1:08:55] are we still here
[1:08:57] huh are we still here
[1:08:59] are we still getting filled with the
[1:09:01] Holy
[1:09:02] holy we still
[1:09:03] live are we still what Christians we
[1:09:05] still believe the message of the hour
[1:09:07] then there must have been a truth hidden
[1:09:09] in there somewhere there must have been
[1:09:11] something that
[1:09:13] sorry give him give him credit he
[1:09:16] listened to God he didn't listen to man
[1:09:18] he didn't listen to those people and
[1:09:20] said if 1977 didn't we don't take a
[1:09:23] Rapture I'm turning my books in
[1:09:26] a lot of them did right pop
[1:09:28] a lot of people turned their books back
[1:09:30] so I'm out of the message brother Brian
[1:09:31] was wrong
[1:09:32] he preached that for a purpose
[1:09:36] to get those naysayers out of the way
[1:09:39] come on man so in 1977 could be a year
[1:09:43] that we started our Jubilee that's right
[1:09:45] don't worry already open and not that
[1:09:48] God sent us a prophet but God sent us a
[1:09:50] prophet with a message and that message
[1:09:53] is what's going to take us out of here
[1:09:56] but he had to stand on that where nobody
[1:09:58] else they left them to score
[1:10:01] he had a dream about Anna I had a little
[1:10:04] seven or eight-year-old girl
[1:10:06] black-headed you know he told the dream
[1:10:08] told dream is a dream that's all brought
[1:10:10] down you're gonna miss him you're gonna
[1:10:12] miss the Rapture because she's gonna be
[1:10:13] she's gonna be way older than that 1977
[1:10:16] way younger than that 1977. so you're
[1:10:19] gonna match that tells us you're gonna
[1:10:20] miss the Rapture and and you're gonna
[1:10:22] have a daughter in the tribulation
[1:10:23] period
[1:10:26] that's what they told him
[1:10:28] that wasn't the truth
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:33] better listen to him they wouldn't have
[1:10:35] had so much headache and heartache in
[1:10:37] 1977. Plus
[1:10:40] hey man that was the truth that's why
[1:10:42] Jesus said hey
[1:10:44] I'm the way the truth and the life
[1:10:47] any man that comes to the father's got
[1:10:49] to come by me
[1:10:52] all right
[1:10:54] so we'll get off of that but I mean
[1:10:56] there's got to be a there's got to be a
[1:10:57] truth
[1:10:58] and you've got to realize it that it's
[1:11:01] not a man
[1:11:03] it was a man yielding himself so that
[1:11:05] God could speak to us
[1:11:07] same way with brother Brown same way
[1:11:09] with brother Dale same way with brother
[1:11:10] Aaron same way with brother Bob brother
[1:11:12] Louise all the different ministers it's
[1:11:14] God it's you yielding yourself and
[1:11:15] letting God speak through you
[1:11:18] but you rightly divide that word of
[1:11:20] Truth by bringing in and talking about
[1:11:22] Daniel 70 weeks and the seals and the
[1:11:24] different things that we've talked about
[1:11:25] and you don't worry about somebody that
[1:11:28] can't understand it or say it calls you
[1:11:29] this or that or the other that don't
[1:11:31] bother me a bit amen
[1:11:33] my dad's always said if I can talk you
[1:11:36] out of your salvation
[1:11:37] you didn't get it to start with that's
[1:11:39] right right
[1:11:40] like you always said we get them in with
[1:11:43] a hot dog get them out with a hamburger
[1:11:45] do you understand that that means we get
[1:11:47] them to come to church we give them a
[1:11:48] supper and feed them and get them to
[1:11:50] come to church but if the next Church
[1:11:52] down the road gets a steak and baked
[1:11:55] potato they're gonna go down the next
[1:11:56] time
[1:11:58] foreign
[1:12:09] 31. we'll be done in just a second I
[1:12:11] just want to make a few points about
[1:12:12] truth today
[1:12:14] like I said this is the time of year
[1:12:15] where it just lies
[1:12:17] it's just lies being told to your kids
[1:12:20] life being told and I'm you know if you
[1:12:21] tell your kids that that's okay
[1:12:23] we all grew up in it so you can't sit
[1:12:25] over and go
[1:12:27] don't bother me none yet does bother you
[1:12:30] right yeah to my saying man thank you
[1:12:35] thank you sister
[1:12:37] John 8 verse 31 says then Jesus then
[1:12:40] said Jesus to those Jews which believed
[1:12:42] on him now look if you continue in my
[1:12:45] word then you are my disciples indeed
[1:12:47] and you shall know the truth
[1:12:50] and the truth shall bind you
[1:12:53] the truth will make you
[1:12:55] oh Lord help it'll make me want to come
[1:12:58] to church
[1:12:59] it'll make me want to not curse it'll
[1:13:01] make me not want to drink oh it'll make
[1:13:03] me not want to wear pants it'll make me
[1:13:06] not want you what
[1:13:07] hey now what you want if you get the
[1:13:09] truth inside of you that's exactly what
[1:13:11] you'll get
[1:13:13] it and look the Bible says that you'll
[1:13:15] know it yeah
[1:13:17] well I don't know if this is right or
[1:13:18] not you know people in the message right
[1:13:20] on the borderline right well if one
[1:13:23] preacher preaches we'll step over here
[1:13:27] and he believes in return Ministry so
[1:13:29] we'll step away
[1:13:32] but now bro damn brother we don't
[1:13:33] believe it so we're gonna step back over
[1:13:35] here
[1:13:38] double-minded right
[1:13:40] you better get set on what you believe
[1:13:43] because if you don't you're off the word
[1:13:46] that's right me or anybody
[1:13:49] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:13:51] truth shall what make you free
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:55] John 8 43 why do you not understand my
[1:13:58] speech hear God Almighty said well you
[1:14:01] understand what I'm saying
[1:14:05] because you can't hear my word well wait
[1:14:07] a minute they were hearing it
[1:14:09] physically right
[1:14:11] right just like you said in a in a
[1:14:14] Minister's meeting you know they start
[1:14:15] talking about something and you you and
[1:14:17] you get up and you give this whole uh
[1:14:20] even brother Noel Johnson the other day
[1:14:21] actually he looked to me and Dad we were
[1:14:23] at a restaurant together and he said I
[1:14:25] have never heard it explained so simple
[1:14:27] and so to the point than what you and
[1:14:30] Dad you're and your dad did at that
[1:14:33] Minister's meeting several years ago
[1:14:35] but now he was one out of 40.
[1:14:38] the other 39
[1:14:41] didn't believe that
[1:14:45] um
[1:14:46] you are of your father the devil and the
[1:14:48] lust of your father you will do he was a
[1:14:51] murderer from the beginning and a bold
[1:14:53] not in the truth
[1:14:56] because there was no truth in him
[1:15:00] when he speak it's a lie he speaketh of
[1:15:04] his own listen when you tell a lie it's
[1:15:06] yours
[1:15:09] right amen it's not of God so you cut it
[1:15:13] off right there but if you speak the
[1:15:15] truth come on somebody if you speak the
[1:15:17] truth it is of god it come from God
[1:15:19] because he's the only one with the truth
[1:15:21] that's right
[1:15:23] now look
[1:15:25] because there's no truth anyway when he
[1:15:27] speaketh the LIE he speaketh of his own
[1:15:29] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:15:32] and because I tell you the truth you
[1:15:35] believe me not
[1:15:37] listen that's why I made that big so we
[1:15:39] can see that and because I tell you the
[1:15:42] truth you believe me not
[1:15:44] John 14 6 Jesus said unto them him I am
[1:15:47] the way amen the truth and the life no
[1:15:50] man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:15:53] John 14 16 said I will pray the father
[1:15:56] and he'll give you another comforter
[1:15:57] that he may abide with you forever what
[1:15:59] even the spirit of Truth
[1:16:02] whom the world cannot receive
[1:16:05] this world hates truth that's why
[1:16:07] they're CNN Fox News
[1:16:09] oh don't get me started on that
[1:16:13] because it's their opinion
[1:16:16] have an opinion over here and we have an
[1:16:18] opinion over here
[1:16:19] but where's the truth amen
[1:16:21] amen even the spirit
[1:16:25] I'm not neither knoweth him but you know
[1:16:27] him so if you know him you know the
[1:16:30] truth yes for he dwelleth with you and
[1:16:33] in you John 15 26 I'll hurry through
[1:16:36] these real quick because I want to read
[1:16:37] this quote to you but when the comforter
[1:16:39] has come whom I will send you unto you
[1:16:41] from the father even the spirit of Truth
[1:16:44] what which is the Holy Ghost which
[1:16:46] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:16:49] testify of Me John 17 17 sanctify them
[1:16:52] through thy truth
[1:16:53] that word is true
[1:16:56] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:16:58] so I upset them
[1:16:59] you into the world and for their sakes I
[1:17:03] sanctify myself that they also amen
[1:17:06] might be Sanctified to error
[1:17:10] oh what'd I say
[1:17:11] truth in it the truth that's the only
[1:17:14] way
[1:17:17] listen to this
[1:17:19] I read you this not too long ago
[1:17:21] Galatians 4 16. am I therefore become
[1:17:23] your enemy because I tell you the truth
[1:17:26] which one I mean you're born in sand
[1:17:28] shaping and you're born a lie
[1:17:31] so you can't stand truth
[1:17:35] come on we try our best to tell the
[1:17:37] truth we do I'm talking about in the
[1:17:39] world
[1:17:41] but how many of y'all
[1:17:43] were Liars
[1:17:45] I'm right got my hand up
[1:17:49] I was a liar because the truth wasn't in
[1:17:51] me then when you tell it lies I told my
[1:17:54] kids when you tell a lie you got to tell
[1:17:55] another one to cover that one
[1:17:57] then you gotta what tell another one but
[1:17:59] if you ever tell the truth you tell it
[1:18:01] one time
[1:18:03] that's right and you can tell that same
[1:18:04] story all the time one time it doesn't
[1:18:07] deviate but when you lie that's why
[1:18:09] lawyers keep you keep getting keep
[1:18:11] asking you the same question
[1:18:12] you should lie
[1:18:14] I'll get you to tell your lie
[1:18:16] so studies show yourself approved or
[1:18:18] work but not need to not be ashamed look
[1:18:19] Riley dividing we already read that
[1:18:22] look watch this talk about Phillips and
[1:18:24] how many minutes they listen to Paul's
[1:18:26] preaching they got a untruth from Paul
[1:18:29] but Paul was preaching the truth
[1:18:31] who concerning the truth have aired
[1:18:33] saying that the resurrection has passed
[1:18:35] and overthrow the faith
[1:18:38] or truth
[1:18:40] of some
[1:18:43] first Peter wants to see you have
[1:18:44] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[1:18:47] you don't just believe it you got to
[1:18:49] obey it amen through the spirit unto
[1:18:52] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[1:18:54] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:18:55] fervently and then being born again not
[1:18:57] a corruptable seed but if incorrupted by
[1:19:00] the word of God which liveth and body
[1:19:01] forever ever Third Street third John one
[1:19:05] verse three look for I Rejoice greatly
[1:19:06] when the Brethren came and testified
[1:19:08] what of the truth that is in thee
[1:19:11] even as thou walkest in the truth I have
[1:19:14] no Greater Joy than to hear that my
[1:19:17] children
[1:19:18] walk in truth you're not gonna how do I
[1:19:20] please God Walk In Truth
[1:19:22] amen
[1:19:23] now the word truth according to
[1:19:25] Webster's Dictionary is a body of real
[1:19:28] things
[1:19:29] real events and facts
[1:19:34] actually
[1:19:35] the state of being the case a fact
[1:19:42] talks about spiritual but look a
[1:19:44] judgment a proposition or the idea that
[1:19:46] is true or look or accepted as truth
[1:19:50] see that's not of God
[1:19:53] if he's accepted as truth it's something
[1:19:56] else
[1:19:57] like the trinitarian doctrine it was
[1:19:59] accepted as Truth at Micaiah but it had
[1:20:02] no truth in it at all everybody with me
[1:20:04] on that that's what that means all right
[1:20:07] the body of true statements
[1:20:14] and propositions
[1:20:16] the property of being in accord with
[1:20:19] what fact or reality do you know if you
[1:20:22] tell a lie
[1:20:24] it's not real
[1:20:27] think about that when you tell a lie
[1:20:30] that means you fabricated something
[1:20:32] that's not true
[1:20:34] in your mind
[1:20:36] because if you tell the truth it's
[1:20:38] exactly what that is this is a black
[1:20:39] boot
[1:20:42] Not Gonna Take It Off
[1:20:43] this is the black boot that's the fact
[1:20:46] but now some of you that can't say it so
[1:20:48] well I think it's white
[1:20:50] well you fabricated a lie
[1:20:53] cause that's black same way with the
[1:20:56] word of God you fabricated the truth
[1:20:58] it's got to be a lie and it can't be
[1:21:00] anything with substance that's why hell
[1:21:03] has no substance hell has no bottom to
[1:21:06] it because it's a lie we weren't
[1:21:08] supposed to none of us go to hell
[1:21:10] what created for us that's right
[1:21:15] sincerity and action character and
[1:21:17] utterance Fidelity or constances I want
[1:21:20] you to listen to this quote right here
[1:21:21] anybody with me we'll close right here
[1:21:24] we'll sing maybe one song
[1:21:26] watch this right here now this is from
[1:21:28] the token 1964. I want you to listen to
[1:21:31] this
[1:21:34] listen
[1:21:35] do you believe that Jesus Christ lives
[1:21:38] and Reigns today
[1:21:40] congregation says all right
[1:21:43] do you believe that I've told you what
[1:21:46] I've told you is the truth
[1:21:50] it's the token the requirement
[1:21:53] I only can speak
[1:21:56] what is truth
[1:21:58] this is brother Brian
[1:22:01] if I believe it was a prophet right I
[1:22:02] want to make sure we're in the same
[1:22:03] congregation
[1:22:04] I only speak what I see
[1:22:08] what I hear and what's revealed to me
[1:22:12] listen to this
[1:22:13] and why I say this of the tens and tens
[1:22:17] thousands of times I looked up if you
[1:22:19] look up that word truth
[1:22:21] brother Brown says that probably 90
[1:22:23] percent of the time he says it in a
[1:22:24] prayer line do you believe I told you
[1:22:25] the truth
[1:22:26] do you believe I told you the truth you
[1:22:28] believe if I've told you the truth God
[1:22:29] will do this you believe I told you the
[1:22:31] truth God will do this
[1:22:32] and they say yes you know what God
[1:22:34] manifest what he said by telling them
[1:22:37] they were from another country or they
[1:22:39] were riding a horse yesterday or old
[1:22:40] driving a blue car or something
[1:22:43] and why I say this of tens and thousands
[1:22:45] of times not one time has ever failed to
[1:22:47] be what true why because it was a fact
[1:22:50] he saw it happen
[1:22:53] now that has to be God
[1:22:56] that has to be God he says it twice well
[1:22:59] would God give a Ministry like that come
[1:23:02] on somebody would God give a Ministry
[1:23:04] like that to somebody that didn't know
[1:23:06] what they're talking about
[1:23:11] would he identify himself as that Seer
[1:23:15] there and then turn around and give him
[1:23:17] a mixed up word
[1:23:19] the guy that denies that's the one
[1:23:22] that's mixed up
[1:23:24] and God ain't mixed up God is his own
[1:23:27] interpreter
[1:23:32] people leave his message all they want
[1:23:34] to they're the ones that's mixed up
[1:23:35] that's right
[1:23:36] if you don't believe that then you know
[1:23:40] there's a moment of truth
[1:23:42] all of us are going to come to a moment
[1:23:43] of truth there's going to be a countdown
[1:23:46] brother Brown said there's going to be
[1:23:47] something that's going to come and we're
[1:23:49] going to come to a place
[1:23:50] you don't have to make a decision well
[1:23:52] you are going to have to make a decision
[1:23:55] what is truth
[1:23:56] that's Paula says what is truth I don't
[1:23:58] have enough information well you got
[1:24:00] enough information amen
[1:24:02] listen to this one more time this and
[1:24:04] then we'll close and then we'll just
[1:24:05] tell you what we'll stand and then we'll
[1:24:07] pray and then we'll go eat all right
[1:24:08] because it's 11 48 now we need to be
[1:24:10] down there in about 20 minutes
[1:24:13] now they don't have this one I just
[1:24:15] pulled it off the computer
[1:24:18] Moses after he received his commission
[1:24:20] this is Cadence born in 1956 went down
[1:24:22] into Egypt and delivered the children of
[1:24:24] Israel one great mistake we find and one
[1:24:27] great thing as it was in that day so it
[1:24:28] is today when we find out that Moses
[1:24:31] went down he got the children of Israel
[1:24:32] and brought them out the phenomenal had
[1:24:34] been done now here it is I don't want to
[1:24:37] hurt you I don't want to shake you a
[1:24:39] jerk to hide off of you for I wish to
[1:24:41] preach the truth
[1:24:42] there's one thing about it brother the
[1:24:45] truth will never make you popular
[1:24:48] right right the truth will never make
[1:24:51] you popular
[1:24:54] but the truth will make you honest
[1:24:57] that's the one good thing and well
[1:25:00] hadn't you rather be honest than to be
[1:25:02] popular
[1:25:05] listen this we'll read this I got to
[1:25:06] read this quote it's a good one
[1:25:08] All Nations and kingdoms Must Fall 1957.
[1:25:11] brother Brown Faith once delivered to
[1:25:13] the Saints every Mortal must give away
[1:25:15] the immortality don't disregard those
[1:25:18] those words because it comes from an
[1:25:19] uneducated person talking about yourself
[1:25:21] don't regard it because that person the
[1:25:24] person that I am but regard it because
[1:25:26] they that's the word of God
[1:25:29] everybody with me and that God himself
[1:25:32] that's what he's saying he's fixing to
[1:25:34] get a prayer line
[1:25:35] if I've told the truth we'll vindicate
[1:25:38] it to be the truth if I'm false then my
[1:25:41] preaching's false then my Doctrine is
[1:25:43] false then I'm false with it
[1:25:47] and if I preach perishable Doctrine and
[1:25:50] a perishable Christ I'll perish with it
[1:25:54] but if I preach the imperishable word of
[1:25:58] God and an imperishable God I'll live
[1:26:01] forever with him I've done my best I
[1:26:04] can't do no more except to God to shake
[1:26:06] your heart to believe amen once more I
[1:26:09] ask him in Christ's name to let this
[1:26:11] happen again tonight for the glory of
[1:26:13] God let's stand our feet
[1:26:18] but God didn't do
[1:26:24] is to get me and you confidence to do
[1:26:26] the same thing
[1:26:28] we must believe that we're being
[1:26:30] preached the gospel too the truth of the
[1:26:33] Gospel
[1:26:35] and know that you know that you know
[1:26:37] that you may have to stand alone this
[1:26:39] church may have may have to stand where
[1:26:41] nobody else wants to fellowship with us
[1:26:42] I don't
[1:26:46] know I'd rather be right than be popular
[1:26:49] that's right amen there's a lot of
[1:26:50] popular preachers in this message
[1:26:53] that ain't telling the whole truth
[1:26:56] okay
[1:26:58] but you got to decide that there's
[1:26:59] powerheads
[1:27:01] Lord today we come to you I know it's a
[1:27:04] hurried time of the year
[1:27:06] we laid a lot of things aside
[1:27:08] we've heard some beautiful singing
[1:27:11] some worship Lord and I pray that the
[1:27:13] word of gods went forth
[1:27:15] as we were
[1:27:16] like I said yesterday we were kind of
[1:27:18] giggling about the world telling so many
[1:27:21] lies and wanting our kids to tell the
[1:27:22] truth but I believe you said you were
[1:27:25] the way the truth and the life
[1:27:26] and his brother Bob brought the truth of
[1:27:29] Saint Nick the truth of this part that
[1:27:31] Santa Claus we know that we know that
[1:27:34] father you were born in April you were
[1:27:36] not born in December
[1:27:39] but Lord maybe this will remind us that
[1:27:42] you had to be born
[1:27:44] and that you were born
[1:27:47] by the word of God
[1:27:49] you were the truth
[1:27:51] you were the life maybe they'll remind
[1:27:54] us in this time of as your Prophet
[1:27:56] preached those many sermons why it had
[1:27:58] to be Shepherds God's wrapped gift
[1:28:02] your Prophet I believe like Christmas
[1:28:04] like I do because a lot of people are
[1:28:06] are more jovial and friendly and kind to
[1:28:09] each other and Lord but let us realize
[1:28:12] you had to be born because when we come
[1:28:14] up in April and in Easter we're going to
[1:28:16] celebrate your death and Resurrection
[1:28:19] so Lord just for a moment you had to be
[1:28:21] born a baby
[1:28:22] and Lord we had to be born again as a
[1:28:24] baby
[1:28:25] but Lord you grew up and you grew in
[1:28:28] Grace and knowledge and you stood up one
[1:28:29] day and you said I am the way the truth
[1:28:32] and the life let us never forget that
[1:28:34] Lord You're the basis of everything we
[1:28:37] do every quote that brother brownham
[1:28:39] quoted was had a basis of you behind it
[1:28:43] and Lord I believe that and for those
[1:28:45] that are not believing Lord I pray that
[1:28:47] you should help them
[1:28:49] that you'll touch their Heart Lord
[1:28:51] soften their heart Lord take that Stony
[1:28:54] heart out that that maybe they want to
[1:28:57] have something different or want to or
[1:28:58] want to not be a part of this bride of
[1:29:01] Jesus Christ
[1:29:03] Lord I pray that you'll touch their
[1:29:04] hearts and maybe this time of the year
[1:29:06] maybe you'll unwrap them as a gift Lord
[1:29:09] and give our wayward ones back to us
[1:29:11] Lord as we unwrap that present at home
[1:29:14] sitting around the fire maybe sitting in
[1:29:16] our living room may we remember the ones
[1:29:19] Lord maybe that are sensing Lord the
[1:29:21] ones that are out in the world the ones
[1:29:22] that are not with us right now Lord I
[1:29:24] pray that you just as we unwrap natural
[1:29:27] gifts that Lord they'll come a
[1:29:30] knock on the door
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:43] I see you stood for the truth you've not
[1:29:45] waved you've not been Wayward you've
[1:29:49] stood for the truth
[1:29:50] and I want some of that truth what may
[1:29:53] we be that way
[1:29:54] and that be the greatest gift
[1:29:57] that was ever given
[1:29:58] is to have a soul
[1:30:01] this back in the fold of God
[1:30:04] Lord grant it father be with us as we go
[1:30:07] eat a natural meal
[1:30:09] we'll have gifts down there Lord and I
[1:30:11] will have prayer for the meal father I
[1:30:13] pray that as we Fellowship though that
[1:30:15] we continually remember
[1:30:17] that we are in the truth I believe that
[1:30:20] we just got to make sure that we follow
[1:30:22] the truth
[1:30:24] and follow it not as a wayward child but
[1:30:27] follow it as the followers of you
