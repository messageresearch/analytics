[7:08] would
[7:09] again just one more time come Among Us
[7:11] Lord
[7:13] not be a bystander to record our
[7:15] thoughts and our ideas but be an active
[7:16] participant in the service father you
[7:18] take over
[7:19] you'll be the one that Lord does the
[7:21] singing does the playing that does the
[7:23] speaking that does the hearing
[7:25] father faith comes by hearing and
[7:27] hearing by the word of God
[7:29] we've come to a place in all of our
[7:30] Lives to where Lord It's 2015 who would
[7:34] have thought
[7:35] that it would have went this long but
[7:38] we're here
[7:39] Lord we want to get out of here because
[7:42] there's a lot of promises and things
[7:44] that are coming our way that
[7:46] that we need to line up before they get
[7:49] here
[7:49] the promise of a change the promise of
[7:52] adoption the promise of speaking the
[7:53] word all those promises we've got to go
[7:56] through a journey before we get there
[7:57] father
[7:58] we pray Lord now that you would help us
[8:01] through that journey be our guide
[8:03] if someone does not know you as their
[8:05] God Lord please do not let them sleep

[8:12] realize that they're lost
[8:15] and on the way to a sinner's hell
[8:18] with no hope without you father

[8:23] heart
[8:25] because it's coming close to the time

[8:31] going to need the things that you have
[8:33] already the provisions that you provided
[8:35] in the word we're going to need them
[8:36] then
[8:38] and not just ask for them at that time

[9:06] need anything else just be with us now
[9:08] Lord take care of us protect us in Jesus
[9:10] name
[9:11] amen
[9:14] if anybody gets too cold hold our hands
[9:16] up except sister Gail and sister Joyce
[9:19] I always absolutely ignore both of them
[9:21] but sister gamble just put on her shawl
[9:25] now Joyce she's already got what she
[9:27] don't have a colonel Hallelujah
[9:30] it's 87 degrees in here that's the
[9:31] reason
[9:33] I'll never forget that day Danny me and
[9:34] you were at uh we were out west hunting
[9:37] in Kansas and
[9:38] sister uh
[9:40] brother Jim Schroeder's wife I mean
[9:42] honestly people
[9:44] candles this big around that come out
[9:47] you know they got a candelabra that
[9:48] comes out from the wall and goes up
[9:49] about this far and there's candles this
[9:51] big around right about that big around
[9:53] not little bitty one big candles we come
[9:56] in there you know when we first started
[9:57] hunting well the candles are kind of
[9:58] bent over like this they're about this
[10:00] tall and they're bent over
[10:02] we could tell why it was 80 something
[10:05] Danny was sweating like he couldn't he
[10:07] couldn't even see to eat
[10:09] it was so hot in that room it had bent
[10:11] those candles she had to take those
[10:13] candles and put them in the microwave
[10:14] and reheat them again to straighten them
[10:16] up and put them back up well they just
[10:17] fall over again it was 86 she said it's
[10:19] just 86 degrees in here just 86 degrees
[10:23] in here
[10:24] I don't think so but we're trying to
[10:26] escape a hotter place this is not too
[10:29] bad now at 70 something degrees so I I
[10:31] turned the air on just for a few minutes
[10:33] and if you want it turned off just walk
[10:36] over there and and touch it but uh
[10:38] second Peter one
[10:40] we're going to review a little bit and
[10:42] then I may have to do a little lengthy
[10:44] reading today but for the introduction
[10:46] this is it may seem boring to some of
[10:48] you but but the word of God should never
[10:50] be born
[10:52] a group of people stood for six hours
[10:54] because they heard a word they'd never
[10:55] heard before they found a set of Scrolls
[10:58] and they were so excited they stood for
[11:00] six hours
[11:01] it didn't say just the young ones did
[11:03] for six hours they said they all stood
[11:05] for six hours and listened to that word
[11:07] being read so I think we can uh
[11:11] we can praise God that we're not six
[11:13] hours long we've been we've sat through
[11:14] a few couple two three hour ones here
[11:17] with uh brother moat and some of the
[11:19] ones but you know what that's what we
[11:20] needed it was time to to pack the word
[11:22] in so so now we can
[11:25] we can try to do the same thing again
[11:27] but not do three hours worth of it so
[11:29] Simon Peter are servant Apostle of Jesus
[11:31] Christ
[11:32] to them that have obtained like Precious
[11:34] Faith with us through the righteousness
[11:36] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace
[11:38] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[11:40] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[11:42] lord according as his divine power
[11:45] have given us all things that pertains
[11:48] unto life and godliness so we're going
[11:50] to be talking about life and godliness
[11:51] when we get into these virtues we're
[11:53] going to get into life lessons all right
[11:54] we're going to get into life and
[11:56] godliness through the knowledge of him
[11:58] that has called us
[11:59] to glory and virtue
[12:01] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[12:03] great and precious promises that by
[12:05] these you might be partakers of the
[12:07] divine nature having escaped the
[12:09] corruption that has won in the world
[12:11] through life now that's Peter's making a
[12:14] point here verse one through four he's
[12:15] making a point you got to be born again
[12:16] you got to have the divine nature of God
[12:18] Amen see now watch this this this this
[12:20] proves the whole thing where people
[12:22] think you got to get the new birth up
[12:24] there no you got to have a new birth to
[12:26] begin with because it says and besides
[12:28] this look at verse five and besides this
[12:30] what besides having the new birth
[12:33] because we're going to read sister
[12:34] Shepard's dreaming a little bit and and
[12:36] she was worried about she was born again
[12:37] she was born again but there were some
[12:39] things that was going on in that dream
[12:41] that will prove that we still need a
[12:43] cleaning out after we're born again okay
[12:46] being born again as the same person that
[12:49] wrote this Peter did and beside this
[12:51] giving all diligence in other words you
[12:54] can't be dilatory
[12:56] you got to have diligence add to your
[12:59] faith virtue and divert your knowledge
[13:00] into knowledge ten percent Temperance
[13:02] patience to patience godliness the
[13:04] godliness brother kindness the brother
[13:05] kindness charity
[13:07] for if these things be in you there's
[13:09] that word if
[13:10] and abound
[13:12] overflowing
[13:14] they make you that you shall neither be
[13:16] Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[13:17] our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:19] but he that lacketh these things as
[13:21] blind he cannot see it far off and has
[13:22] forgotten that he was Purge from his old
[13:24] sins
[13:25] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[13:27] diligence to make your calling and
[13:29] election sure for if you do these things
[13:32] ye shall never fall
[13:35] amen you Lord that is blessing to the
[13:37] word go and be seated we're going to
[13:38] read Ephesians 4. we're just going to
[13:40] background here for a minute until it
[13:42] cools down up here
[13:44] and uh
[13:46] then we will uh
[13:48] begin the lesson for the afternoon we're
[13:50] still in the introduction we still want
[13:53] to
[13:54] set a background
[13:57] for what we want to speak on
[13:59] for the next several services
[14:02] Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some Apostles
[14:04] now for the ones that were not here this
[14:06] morning are the ones just clicked on uh
[14:09] Peter
[14:10] told us
[14:12] what to get
[14:15] he told us what to get at divine nature
[14:17] add to your faith adverts but he really
[14:19] never said how to get it he said you
[14:22] must obtain it
[14:23] so Paul picks up picks up Peter same
[14:27] Holy Ghost but Paul picks it up and says
[14:29] okay this is how you get it and he gave
[14:32] some Apostles some Prophet some
[14:33] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[14:35] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[14:39] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[14:41] the body of Christ
[14:42] see you can't edify the body if you
[14:45] don't have somebody's got to have these
[14:46] virtues working in life somebody asked
[14:48] me a question a little while ago said
[14:50] why you know that is that the reason
[14:51] we're still here yes somebody must have
[14:54] all these virtues working in their life
[14:56] go up to the Holy Spirit go up to love
[14:59] and be capped as a adopted son of God
[15:03] and then still
[15:05] something's got to happen
[15:08] you say what's going to happen well
[15:10] brother Branham got brother Branham was
[15:12] standing there just like this and he's
[15:13] in the grave
[15:15] he's waiting on someone to come to full
[15:18] maturity but maybe just not one person
[15:20] it needs to be all of us that's the
[15:22] reason we all are still here
[15:26] that's right the reason we're still here
[15:28] it's just the planes it's not that I've
[15:32] said many times before and I hope it
[15:34] rains home God didn't just put a day on
[15:37] a calendar and exit and say this is when
[15:39] I'm coming that's right
[15:41] he knew when the he knew when it would
[15:45] happen
[15:46] right but it's not a red letter day that
[15:48] he's got axed off it's when his people
[15:50] get ready right man it's when his people
[15:53] are at the place to where God can work
[15:56] in them them like he did in Adam and Eve
[16:00] I said Adam and Eve before the fall they
[16:04] were co-equal right because it's got to
[16:06] be Christ in this bride to finish the
[16:08] program right it can't just be one or
[16:10] the other for the perfecting of the
[16:12] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[16:13] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[16:16] we all come into the unity of the faith
[16:18] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[16:21] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[16:24] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[16:26] and Christ was the fullness as we looked
[16:28] in the chart this morning that's the
[16:30] fullness of Christ
[16:32] The Headstone that man when he walked on
[16:35] the face of the Earth he was the stature
[16:37] of a perfect man amen all right
[16:40] he was the one that we looked to
[16:42] that we henceforth be no more children
[16:45] Ephesians 4 14 tossed to and fro and
[16:49] carried away that's our problem
[16:51] our problem is is we are still
[16:54] some still children we still like milk I
[16:58] still like milk but I don't drink it
[17:00] every day
[17:02] I like strong meat
[17:05] I
[17:06] it's like I told somebody not too long
[17:09] ago you know God somebody was talking
[17:11] about being a vegetarian I said God give
[17:13] me the wrong teeth for that that's right
[17:16] oh hey Benny hey
[17:20] he gave me incisors and he gave me
[17:22] canines
[17:26] canines are meat eaters
[17:30] Jesus eat fish that's a meat so I'm okay
[17:33] that we henceforth be no more children
[17:35] though
[17:37] toss to and fro now see if you're tossed
[17:40] to and fro just say look I'm a child
[17:42] I'm just a kid in God I'm just a child
[17:46] and you see that as you carry yourself
[17:48] on in life
[17:49] you see you know I've been back to this
[17:51] church 16 years now and um well it
[17:54] didn't seem like that long but it has
[17:55] been 16 years and you see people leave
[17:59] and come back and leave and come back or
[18:00] leave and don't come back well one
[18:04] thing's for sure they really never got
[18:06] settled
[18:07] or they don't have the Holy Ghost to
[18:09] start with all right because you toss to
[18:12] and fro and carried about with every
[18:15] wind of Doctrine by the sleight of it
[18:18] didn't say man
[18:20] it says men so it's not just in one
[18:23] person and cunning craftiness
[18:26] whereby they lie and wait to deceive all
[18:30] right but speaking the truth in love may
[18:33] grow up see we henceforth being more
[18:36] children so we may grow up into him in
[18:40] all things which is the head even Christ
[18:42] so he is if he's the head of all things
[18:44] then we must come up to the head
[18:47] May grow up into him in all things which
[18:49] is the head even Christ from whom the
[18:52] whole body fitly joined together right
[18:54] and compacted
[18:57] not just put together I mean you really
[18:59] pound it together by that which every
[19:01] joint supplies according to the
[19:04] effectual working and the measure
[19:05] there's a measure
[19:07] of every part maketh increase of the
[19:10] body onto the edifying of itself
[19:13] in love right right all right so we've
[19:17] come to a place to where then we looked
[19:18] this morning we were talking about the
[19:20] The Headstone uh if you would pull the
[19:23] pull the the full number one
[19:27] uh picture up brother Anderson
[19:32] brother Anderson's name doesn't get
[19:33] called much he's really the one that
[19:35] puts these things up here
[19:36] if he's not asleep there we go okay but
[19:39] this is the phone
[19:41] this is the full oh I'm sorry it's it's
[19:44] Sarah's father
[19:46] I told him I said when that baby's born
[19:48] you'll only be known from now on it's
[19:49] Sarah's father you won't be known as
[19:51] Anderson you'll be Brother Anderson
[19:52] you'll be Sarah's father
[19:54] so but you see this is the fullness this
[19:56] is Jesus Christ now
[19:59] we see that when he ascended and left
[20:03] that The Headstone was rejected by man
[20:06] of course he was rejected and killed
[20:08] but there was nothing for it to fall
[20:10] back on except for that Foundation of
[20:13] Faith the apostles and Prophets right
[20:15] the day of Pentecost on the day of
[20:17] Pentecost take that away
[20:20] on the day of Pentecost
[20:24] this came here
[20:26] the faith
[20:28] the revelation of the Son of God the
[20:30] Holy Ghost came back on the day of
[20:33] Pentecost
[20:34] in the hearts of the Believers but the
[20:37] son of man Ministry was taken away
[20:39] because man couldn't handle it and one
[20:42] thing's for sure the son of man is the
[20:44] complete revelation of God not just part
[20:46] revelation of God
[20:48] he was the fullness of the godhead
[20:50] bottling all right that's why you see
[20:52] all that is the fullness of the godhead
[20:54] bodily well at one time when he took
[20:58] that away then we come down here and we
[21:00] start at the faith that was once
[21:03] delivered to the Saints now remember
[21:04] they had these virtues working in their
[21:06] life
[21:10] the first three ages basically we can
[21:12] say the first three ages I said we
[21:13] wouldn't go get into church ages but
[21:14] really the first three Church ages had
[21:17] the complete Revelation right and when
[21:19] we get into it later on you'll see in
[21:21] brotherly kindness where they had all
[21:23] things common brother Brown said that
[21:24] was a brotherly kindness for the ages
[21:27] they all had all things common right
[21:29] and we'll get into it and we'll see if
[21:32] you have the same reaction those who did
[21:34] downstairs with brother what brother
[21:36] Brown said about brotherly kindness
[21:37] just make sure you get you bring your uh
[21:40] make sure you bring your checkbook and
[21:42] your savings account book
[21:44] bring you a house no mortgage the house
[21:47] the uh and all that bring it with you
[21:49] that day and we'll talk about it
[21:51] because that's what brother Brown said
[21:52] in in the first church age they had all
[21:54] things common is they gave all their
[21:56] money to one person and he distributed
[21:57] it out
[21:59] um so anyway
[22:03] bring cash no brain trade but bring cash
[22:06] but when you start down here at Faith
[22:08] that's the foundation
[22:10] then we were talking in word Zechariah
[22:13] it talks about zerubbable
[22:15] where's the rubable which was a real man
[22:17] he comes and builds the the Jerusalem
[22:20] back right the house of Israel he comes
[22:23] back but it's removal obviously isn't
[22:25] tight would be Jesus Christ or it would
[22:28] be the message of the hour because what
[22:30] happened was down in the church ages all
[22:32] this was eat down to a degree to where
[22:34] it couldn't work there was nothing but
[22:36] just like brother Brown said in that
[22:38] fourth Church age just to believe God
[22:40] you got killed right
[22:42] just to have faith just to believe on
[22:44] God you were killed for that
[22:47] now
[22:49] you know they didn't have to have a lot
[22:51] of these virtues but you know what they
[22:53] did look at that though they had
[22:54] patience
[22:59] so if you got the Holy Ghost you got a
[23:01] certain degree of these because I'm
[23:02] gonna read you a quote in a man where
[23:03] brother Ram said you don't even have to
[23:04] have the Holy Ghost to have certain
[23:05] degree of the virtues but not the
[23:08] virtues of God there's a difference
[23:10] these are not just well I knew a man
[23:13] that well if he didn't if he wasn't born
[23:15] again he didn't have none of that
[23:17] you got to be born again first that's
[23:19] what we established and then we read
[23:21] also in the scriptures just trying to
[23:23] background a few minutes that he was
[23:25] that he was The Headstone but as they
[23:28] rejected him he comes down and becomes
[23:30] the Cornerstone
[23:32] put that one out right there he comes
[23:34] down and becomes the Cornerstone
[23:37] because the removable had to build that
[23:39] thing square with the plummet
[23:41] and you take those and that's just a
[23:43] mini pyramid in itself
[23:45] but there's your Cornerstone and the
[23:47] Cornerstone started back down here he
[23:49] had to start with a building his
[23:51] removable had to start that from a
[23:54] foundation right right and then build
[23:56] the temple up because everything sets on
[23:58] the foundation but then in the end time
[24:00] he not only comes here he goes right
[24:04] back up and becomes The Headstone again
[24:06] that's why the headstone was brought
[24:08] back into the church in the end time did
[24:10] everybody follow that okay this morning
[24:11] if you have any questions like I said
[24:13] jot them down and maybe
[24:15] maybe two Sundays from now we'll have
[24:17] one Sunday afternoon where we'll have
[24:19] questions but if you've got any
[24:20] questions just you know put them on a
[24:21] piece of paper and lay them up here or
[24:23] give them to me or brother Dale one and
[24:25] we'll try to answer them but what I'm
[24:26] trying to do is is set a
[24:28] to make a statement number one that this
[24:31] is not just a good drawing
[24:33] this is not just a good drawing that it
[24:35] looks good and brother random knew what
[24:37] he was doing no the almighty gave him
[24:39] this right
[24:40] right he was sitting out under a tree
[24:42] squirrel hunting he said this chart is
[24:44] what God this is what came to me all
[24:46] right so zerubbabel in the form of the
[24:50] Elijah of the day had to knew them that
[24:53] he had to build this church back up to
[24:55] the faith of the fathers all right
[24:57] because it had been the the word effects
[25:00] of the word had been eroded by man's
[25:02] tradition and brother Brown called him
[25:04] loose ends right it was loose ends that
[25:06] man see this is there's no loose ends
[25:08] you see anything loose about this no no
[25:10] that's Firm Foundation you got all your
[25:13] you know you got everything tied
[25:14] together everything's exactly where it
[25:16] should be so that's the way God wants it
[25:19] he doesn't want it to have holes in it
[25:21] or anything like that he wants it to be
[25:23] a firm building and you know what it
[25:24] will be
[25:26] it will be God's already promised it it
[25:28] will be so it's going to be a firm
[25:30] foundation
[25:31] it's going to be exactly what God wants
[25:33] okay so everybody okay with that
[25:35] he became the head of the corner
[25:38] we read that this morning there in
[25:40] Ephesians 2 19 Jesus Christ himself
[25:44] being the Chief Cornerstone
[25:46] verse 21 you don't have to pull it up in
[25:47] whom all the building fitly framed
[25:49] together groweth into it holy Temple in
[25:53] the Lord in whom ye also are building
[25:55] together for a habitation of God through
[25:58] the spirit so it has to come through the
[26:01] Spirit by fivefold Ministry to bring
[26:03] that headstone back into the place that
[26:06] it should be that's why the pyramids
[26:08] didn't have the head on it
[26:11] showing the crash would be rejected but
[26:14] Christ in being rejected he just went
[26:16] down there started building the
[26:17] foundation out of the same material that
[26:19] he had in the head right he started
[26:21] building that foundation and started
[26:22] going up then we read in First Peter
[26:24] about being Lively stones
[26:26] I'm just trying to catch up here and
[26:28] then become a stone of stumbling a rock
[26:30] of a fence if you're not in there if
[26:32] you're not in that pyramid then you're
[26:34] going to stumble over and I think a lot
[26:35] of people even Christians stumble over
[26:37] things
[26:38] right amen they stumble over things they
[26:40] stumble over and they don't uh
[26:42] they don't think things that are
[26:44] important or whatever but um
[26:47] can't make them you bring them to water
[26:49] but you can't make them drink
[26:50] then in Galatians it says after the
[26:52] faith has come we no longer under a
[26:54] Schoolmaster a Schoolmaster was what
[26:57] brought us unto Christ
[26:58] the school master was the do's and the
[27:01] don'ts to bring us there because
[27:03] honestly when we we're going to talk on
[27:05] a new birth next Sunday
[27:07] honestly in the New Birth people you
[27:10] know they say well I quit smoking I quit
[27:11] drinking I quit doing this I must have
[27:13] the new birth
[27:15] that's sanctification
[27:17] if you're still doing those things
[27:18] you're not even Sanctified you may be
[27:20] justified but you're not even Sanctified
[27:22] you're not even in order for this
[27:25] you're not even ordered for communion
[27:28] amen you're not order for doing anything
[27:31] you shouldn't be doing anything up here
[27:32] you shouldn't be doing anything if
[27:34] you're still doing those things and
[27:36] you're not born again we need born-again
[27:37] people
[27:38] we need people that God can work through
[27:42] hey there's all time we all had to be
[27:43] worked on
[27:45] we all have to be worked on we still
[27:47] have to be worked on but there's a time
[27:49] when you the old things are passed away
[27:51] the Bible says All Things become new a
[27:53] certain time where you guys say that's
[27:54] it
[27:55] and that don't happen to me no more
[27:58] you know you God can deal with you
[28:00] different ways
[28:01] but when you got a problem and you see
[28:04] that problem get wiped away and
[28:05] especially if it's a habit
[28:07] then you know it was God did it you
[28:09] didn't do it because you can't
[28:11] this is not alcohol it's anonymous
[28:15] we believe in Deliverance not
[28:17] suppression
[28:18] right all Alcoholics Anonymous does it
[28:21] just makes that demon go down just a
[28:23] little bit hides him a little bit makes
[28:25] you deny what you are they say once a
[28:27] drunk always a drunk no
[28:29] not when you get born again
[28:31] you're born again that thing will go out
[28:34] the door I promise you because I I I did
[28:36] I did the tobacco thing for 20 something
[28:39] years
[28:40] and the day I walked right there at that
[28:42] this spot right here I laid it down
[28:45] and the next day I didn't want it no
[28:47] more the next day I didn't want it no
[28:48] more okay so God knew that that was
[28:50] something I'd have to deal with though
[28:52] because you got to find out what God's
[28:53] got to deal with you also and then you
[28:56] got to but we gotta deal with it I'm not
[28:59] still dealing with it 16 years later
[29:00] it's still dead
[29:02] once something's dead is dead
[29:04] amen because remember we're going to
[29:06] talk about life and godliness all right
[29:09] that's what the statue of perfect man is
[29:10] life and godliness so it's going to talk
[29:12] about our life and the things that we do
[29:14] even after you say after you're born
[29:16] again absolutely after you're born again
[29:18] brother Brown said Satan turns every gun
[29:21] on you and man he'll start he'll start
[29:23] blowing it wasn't that I wasn't tempted
[29:25] about what I did
[29:28] I still had tobacco you know how
[29:30] cigarette smokers were those you smoke
[29:32] cigarettes you had one here you had one
[29:33] in the pocket you had two in your car
[29:35] you made sure you didn't run out you had
[29:37] them stuck everywhere
[29:38] same way with chewing tobacco and
[29:40] anything else drinking or whatever
[29:41] you're going to hide stuff somewhere
[29:43] and you know you always get around a
[29:46] bunch of guys and they always say hey
[29:47] here you know and they throw you
[29:48] something or beer or whatever you know
[29:50] but when you say no
[29:53] and you may know
[29:55] and you you know that that thing's gone
[29:57] right because then the other time you do
[29:59] it right right but when you know that
[30:01] thing's gone when you know that Demon's
[30:03] dead
[30:04] see what I've done is when that demon
[30:07] was dead see I don't have to go back and
[30:08] say well I'm worried about don't worry
[30:10] about that one go the next demon because
[30:12] I promise you there's a line of them
[30:15] if you made your seat was just one but
[30:17] they line them back there somewhere
[30:18] right
[30:19] one dies one pops up one dies one pops
[30:22] up
[30:23] oh so it doesn't just happen to me well
[30:25] praise the Lord
[30:26] all right so on the Statue of a perfect
[30:28] man let's go to that first quote
[30:30] and get started right here
[30:35] now we're approaching the Seven Seals
[30:37] we've just finished the seven Church
[30:39] ages and this is the message on teaching
[30:40] that ties the man in
[30:43] that's going to be Redeemed by the blood
[30:45] of the Lord Jesus and it's going to be
[30:46] in that church age that Eternal Church
[30:48] age at the end of the seal so now let us
[30:51] read first Peter and he continues
[30:52] reading that
[30:56] let's go to paragraph 35.
[31:00] you scroll it on up brother Brad was
[31:01] reading that in paragraph 35 says notice
[31:03] he's saying that I have obtained this
[31:05] Faith come out Peter
[31:08] and I'm addressing this to them that has
[31:11] obtained the like Precious Faith so see
[31:13] you got to be born again that that
[31:15] answers the question right there right
[31:17] it's not the Holy Spirit up here that
[31:18] we're dealing with right now it's the
[31:20] holy spirit that we're dealing with down
[31:22] at the bottom of the pyramid that we'll
[31:24] talk about next Sunday getting us into
[31:27] the body and getting us in line for
[31:30] service okay right because remember
[31:32] sanctification is clean and set aside
[31:35] for service
[31:36] the Holy Ghost is putting you in service
[31:38] well in service is going to start
[31:39] putting you up giving you these virtues
[31:42] if you want them
[31:44] if you want them it's not to the outside
[31:47] world this is to the church see those
[31:50] that are in Christ and he reads on up
[31:52] let's go on up just get save time go to
[31:55] the paragraph 36. now let that soak in
[31:57] real deep now preaching this morning
[31:59] just not preaching just teaching divine
[32:02] nature
[32:03] because this is the divine nature of God
[32:05] if you want to characterize God in any
[32:07] way
[32:08] that's why this is important if you want
[32:10] to say well how do you know what God is
[32:15] that's God
[32:17] that's the virtue of God the knowledge
[32:18] of God the temperance of God the
[32:20] patience of God the brotherly kindness
[32:21] of God the holy spirit of God and the
[32:23] love of God it's all God right there's
[32:26] no devil in there anywhere there's no
[32:28] place for Satan anywhere in that all
[32:30] right that's why we're still here
[32:32] because we still leave a place for the
[32:34] devil right
[32:37] somebody being amen or somebody owe me
[32:39] it doesn't matter
[32:40] it's the truth anyhow
[32:43] but look
[32:46] he talks about divine nature verse in
[32:47] number 37 see the world we've escaped
[32:49] that now he's addressing this to the
[32:51] church that's why we're here this
[32:53] morning is to find out what is the way
[32:55] what is God's requirement so they must
[32:58] be required there's not a person in here
[33:01] that loves God but wants to become more
[33:03] like Christ now it's laid out here so
[33:06] there's if you want to be more like
[33:07] Christ it's going to be laid out in the
[33:09] Statue of a perfect man amen now it's
[33:12] laid out here every Christian
[33:14] talk about old veterans so let's go to
[33:16] 1A now this is one we stopped on this
[33:18] morning so now let's bring it up just a
[33:20] little bit more let's go to 1A statue a
[33:23] perfect man
[33:24] I haven't escaped the corruption that is
[33:26] in the world having escaped that the
[33:28] lust the corruption of the world you're
[33:29] above that now that's the type of person
[33:32] that he's talking to the person that's
[33:33] escaped these things
[33:35] see the corruption of the world and
[33:37] besides this giving all diligence he
[33:39] read the scripture
[33:40] add to your faith version The Virtue
[33:41] knowledge knowledge Temperance tempers
[33:43] patience patience Godless godliness
[33:44] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[33:46] kindness charity right right now he has
[33:49] given us the outline here what to do
[33:51] know how to do it
[33:55] now as I said we're all trying to come
[33:57] closer to God that's why I chose this
[33:59] message this morning for the church all
[34:02] right so it's not for the world this is
[34:04] for the church all right let's go to
[34:05] quote number two
[34:08] all right quote number two is the statue
[34:10] of perfect man paragraph 69 we're just
[34:12] going to kind of read a few this is
[34:13] going to be kind of long but watch what
[34:16] he's talking about what is the
[34:18] Tabernacle now a body God tabernacling
[34:20] in a body God wants up high when he
[34:23] comes down on a mountain even if a
[34:25] bullock or cow touched the mountain he
[34:26] must be killed God is Holy
[34:29] now remember that's the same God that
[34:30] was back there the same God's supposed
[34:32] to be in you okay all right last evening
[34:34] when these angels covered their faces
[34:36] holy seraphims with holy faces don't
[34:39] even know what sin means and they have
[34:40] to cover their face in the presence of
[34:42] God cover their feet and humility now
[34:44] holy God could not condone sin so
[34:47] nothing could touch the mountain where
[34:48] God was
[34:49] then God was made flesh and dwelt Among
[34:51] Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son
[34:53] his creation then that son gave his life
[34:56] and the blood cell of God was broken
[34:59] that the life might come out of the
[35:01] blood to us amen all right come out of
[35:04] the blood to us through that blood we
[35:07] are cleansed and now our blood watch now
[35:11] our blood our life which came by living
[35:14] through sexual desire brought our life
[35:17] in the world that's obvious we're all
[35:19] sitting here we know how we all got here
[35:21] all right the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:24] cleanses us
[35:26] changes our nature
[35:28] by sending upon us the Holy Spirit right
[35:32] that's right then we become into the
[35:34] divine nature of God
[35:37] we come into that then we become a
[35:40] dwelling place for God everybody see
[35:44] that same amen
[35:45] amen that's what it means now let's go
[35:47] to paragraph 75.
[35:49] know how that God is in his church the
[35:52] church is now supposed to be taking the
[35:54] place of Christ right
[35:56] carrying on his ministry either
[35:57] believeth on me the works that I do
[35:59] shall he do also yet a little while in
[36:00] the world see me no more yet you shall
[36:03] see me
[36:04] for I will be with you even in you to
[36:06] the end of the world see there it is
[36:07] carrying on on his work
[36:09] now God or the Bible says here that
[36:11] Stephen spoke of Solomon building a
[36:13] temple
[36:14] and the most I don't dwell in temples
[36:16] made with hands so this is not a temple
[36:18] made with hands this is actually this is
[36:20] not a building it's a person
[36:22] all right it's a person it's not a
[36:23] building it's a person for Heaven is my
[36:26] Throne Earth is my footstool and where's
[36:27] the place of my rest well it's in you
[36:29] let me answer that question right but he
[36:32] doesn't want to just rest in you
[36:35] he wants to use you all right he doesn't
[36:38] just want to rest he wants to use you
[36:41] but a body has now prepared me amen
[36:44] there you are a body has thou prepared
[36:46] me scrolled all the way up if you don't
[36:47] mind so we can the ones in the back
[36:49] can't see it God dwells in the stature
[36:53] yes not statue
[36:55] stature of a man reflecting himself into
[36:58] that being
[37:00] perfect worship
[37:02] God in us being his Tabernacle God
[37:04] manifesting oh how we could stay on that
[37:06] till you would almost suffocate and hear
[37:08] from me notice God has always at all
[37:12] times reflected himself in man
[37:15] always
[37:17] at all times reflected himself in man
[37:20] didn't want him to work himself in an
[37:22] animal right right didn't want to
[37:23] reflect himself in the stars or this
[37:25] great ball of Earth he wants to reflect
[37:28] himself in a man because what we're Made
[37:30] In His Image we're his children right so
[37:33] he wants his children to have
[37:35] what he has amen now let's go to number
[37:38] three
[37:40] this is a good one I like this one in
[37:42] the next few now Peter is outlining
[37:45] something here for us that how to get
[37:48] there amen
[37:49] okay so he's telling us how to get there
[37:51] all right
[37:53] now I want to say this that there are
[37:55] some people who have a portion of this
[37:57] virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so
[37:59] forth that don't even profess to be
[38:01] Christian right now we just were
[38:03] teaching Sunday school and that's true
[38:05] there's some have a portion of this that
[38:07] don't even pretend to be Christian but
[38:10] that doesn't that won't do it right it's
[38:13] like a black bird trying to put peacock
[38:15] feathers in his wings to make him a
[38:17] peacock he only disgraces himself
[38:22] be better to stay a blackbird
[38:24] right see when he tries to exercise
[38:26] these things without being a Christian
[38:29] he's just simply out of place all right
[38:33] when you're trying to pretend and now
[38:35] let's go to 3A where brother Branham
[38:36] explains this in my in my words he
[38:40] explains it
[38:42] because what's he talking about unless
[38:45] we suffer with him this is in chapter
[38:46] four of the smyrnan church age now my
[38:49] computer it didn't have a
[38:51] it didn't have a paragraph number so I
[38:54] don't know what paragraph number it is
[38:55] but you ought to be able to look it up
[38:56] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[38:59] reign with him
[39:00] see these are sufferings
[39:02] like brother Keith 3 said this is the
[39:04] trials of life this is the things we
[39:06] must do
[39:07] because look people we got to be
[39:09] Overcomers
[39:11] we got we got to overcome something okay
[39:14] you have to suffer to reign
[39:17] the reason for this is that character
[39:20] simply is never never made without
[39:22] suffering this is the characteristics
[39:26] are the character of almighty God right
[39:29] these virtues are the characters so when
[39:32] I say virtues you say character in your
[39:34] brain when you say virtues you say
[39:36] character character virtues same thing
[39:39] okay because it's your characteristics
[39:43] character is a victory not a gift
[39:48] so he's not going to give you these just
[39:50] because you're a Christian
[39:54] a man without character can't Reign
[39:57] right right because power
[39:59] apart from character right it's satanic
[40:03] you remember the Simon the Sorcerer I
[40:06] believe it was he he followed Paul and
[40:08] uh and Stephen or somebody or Paul and
[40:11] somebody around
[40:13] and he saw him doing Mighty signs and
[40:15] wonders he said let me buy that I want
[40:17] to buy that from you I want to I want to
[40:20] get that from you and the movie that
[40:22] sister Johnny gave me it was really neat
[40:24] because uh Peter turned around and said
[40:27] God knows your heart
[40:30] and that's what it is God knows your
[40:32] heart he knows you won't use it right
[40:33] right so therefore he won't give it to
[40:35] you right same thing with that power
[40:38] without character is satanic we have the
[40:41] power
[40:42] we have the Holy Ghost that's the most
[40:44] power you ever need but without the
[40:47] character of God you'll use it wrong
[40:50] Elisha had the power
[40:53] he didn't have the new birth but he had
[40:55] the power
[40:56] right God did what Elisha said right
[41:01] if Elisha would have had character to go
[41:04] with that power he would have never
[41:06] called those she Bears to eat those 42
[41:09] children exactly that's the difference
[41:11] in the Old Testament and the New
[41:13] Testament David all those ones that you
[41:15] see God's power
[41:17] but they just didn't have the character
[41:19] to go along with it right so power
[41:21] without character is satanic right in
[41:25] other words you'll use it wrong right
[41:27] okay but Power with character is fit to
[41:30] rule and since he wants us to share even
[41:33] his throne on the same basis that he
[41:37] overcome
[41:38] and he sat down in his father's Throne
[41:39] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[41:44] and a little temporary suffering we go
[41:46] through now is not worthy to be compared
[41:48] to the tremendous Glory that we will be
[41:52] revealed and us when he comes
[41:56] oh what Treasures are laid up for those
[41:58] who are willing to enter into his
[41:59] kingdom through much tribulation unless
[42:03] we suffer with him we cannot reign with
[42:05] him because look people
[42:08] our human character
[42:11] is contrary to God
[42:15] our human character is contrary to God
[42:18] so God must change that and it must be a
[42:22] victory it must be a suffering
[42:25] that we must go through because it's not
[42:29] a gift
[42:30] character is a victory amen
[42:36] when you come to a place to where you
[42:38] see that God's dealing in your life and
[42:41] like some downstairs with uh most
[42:45] everybody had a problem with temperance
[42:48] Mr Johnny's got her hand up kind of like
[42:50] this
[42:53] but when you know that that person Cuts
[42:56] you off usually it's road rage
[42:58] Satan has got in our cars now like he
[43:02] wasn't there before
[43:04] but road rage is one thing that really
[43:05] you know it upsets people and sister
[43:08] Johnny said a lot of times that would
[43:09] happen to her because she's from New
[43:10] York but she don't mind me telling it
[43:13] but she's overcome that
[43:16] but you know what she had to go through
[43:17] it
[43:18] right to overcome it
[43:21] you can't just walk through you can't
[43:23] just walk through life and the rose
[43:25] bushes just clear back as you walk
[43:27] through yeah that yeah that's what's
[43:29] going to happen the rose bushes are just
[43:30] going to park and you're going to just
[43:32] walk right through and they're going to
[43:33] be throwing cotton at your feet
[43:41] character is a victory
[43:44] not a gift so God's gonna put you
[43:46] through that
[43:47] and the reason listen if you'll take a
[43:50] test like this the Reason God puts you
[43:52] through the test he knows that you'll
[43:55] pass the test
[43:57] or if you don't he's going to give it to
[43:59] you again until you do pass it exactly
[44:02] right because remember he doesn't have
[44:04] anyone fail now you can fail yes
[44:07] yes God won't fail you can fail you can
[44:09] fail and stop anytime you want to
[44:11] because I'll read it here in just a
[44:12] minute
[44:13] but Power without character
[44:17] is satanic right
[44:19] you have all the power in the world if
[44:20] you can't use it right
[44:22] it's not of God right right but Power
[44:25] with character is fit to rule and he
[44:28] wants us to rule and reign with him so
[44:29] let's go to number four still in the
[44:31] Statue of a perfect man paragraph 94.
[44:34] went out and then I'm talking to it like
[44:37] what brother Brown was talking about the
[44:39] the black bird that sticks the peacock
[44:41] feathers in that's power without
[44:43] character he's a bird
[44:45] the peacock's a bird the black Bird's a
[44:47] bird they're in the same family the
[44:48] birds
[44:49] it's just that the peacock I mean the
[44:51] the old ugly Blackbird wants to look
[44:54] like the peacock so he takes peacock
[44:55] feathers and he starts sticking them in
[44:57] well somewhere along the line they're
[44:58] gonna fall out and he's just going to be
[45:00] a blackbird well now that's the way it
[45:02] is trying to manufacture Christianity
[45:06] you can't do it the first thing you've
[45:09] got to do is be born again
[45:11] you've got to be chain see and when
[45:15] you're changed you become a new creation
[45:19] now you're getting right now
[45:23] so you don't have to worry about the
[45:24] feathers it takes care of itself
[45:27] all right I mean you know a lot of these
[45:29] people are
[45:31] uh you know they say well I always was a
[45:33] I always was a wheat plant well I've got
[45:35] quotes from Brother Brown said he was a
[45:37] kookaburra and had to be transformed
[45:39] right I think it's I thought it was it
[45:41] would be real easy for God to just say
[45:43] well you always was that yeah
[45:45] foreign
[45:50] no but for me to realize I was a black
[45:52] bird right but I want to be a peacock
[45:55] but it's not that I'm going to take and
[45:56] stay a crow
[45:58] or Blackbird and act like a peacock no
[46:00] God's gonna say you won't look like that
[46:02] peacock
[46:03] I'll change you into that peacock if
[46:04] that's what you want to be
[46:06] if that's what you want to be I'll put
[46:07] you over there because remember it all
[46:08] comes from the inside out brother Brown
[46:10] said he changed me from a from a cuckoo
[46:13] bird to a wheat plant
[46:15] we'll we'll talk about that maybe next
[46:17] week but um roll it up it's talking
[46:20] about a hog bent a Hog's a hog it
[46:22] doesn't matter what you do you can push
[46:23] the tuxedo suit on him and he runs right
[46:25] back into the water because he's a hog
[46:26] now notice you must be born again that
[46:29] is changed right
[46:31] right there's got to be a change now how
[46:34] many times he said that in the past
[46:35] several several quotes there's got to be
[46:38] a change you can't act like you acted
[46:42] even six months ago to certain degrees
[46:46] all right now there's certain things
[46:48] dirt and characters that we're going to
[46:49] have to deal with characters that we
[46:51] have that are traits that Donnie likes
[46:53] cars and I like to hunt that don't make
[46:55] us different
[46:56] that just makes humanly that he likes
[46:59] cars and I like and I like hunting I
[47:01] might listen I might endure him talking
[47:03] about cars and he may endure me talking
[47:05] about hunting
[47:06] but there's in these virtues that's not
[47:10] a well maybe I'll have a little bit of
[47:11] this virtue no you gotta have the virtue
[47:13] of God Amen it's God's virtue it's not
[47:16] human nothing right
[47:18] right if it was human anything we can
[47:20] manufacture it that's right
[47:22] and I think what we're doing is a lot of
[47:24] times we're trying to manufacture it
[47:25] can't do that you can't manufacture God
[47:29] because power without character is
[47:32] satanic now let's read this quote right
[47:34] here
[47:36] everybody kind of getting the gist of it
[47:38] watch one more time
[47:40] notice you must be born again
[47:43] I really don't see how people I you know
[47:45] we've seen daddy Brothers been with some
[47:47] people that you know turn the pyramid
[47:49] upside down and all this stuff and try
[47:50] to get the Holy Ghost here and there
[47:52] let's just see what the prophet says
[47:53] right
[47:55] now you must be born again and when
[47:57] you're born again you can't be born
[47:59] again without having
[48:02] faith faith is the foundation it's real
[48:06] wide you got to have a lot of it
[48:08] right
[48:10] so that's right so you see on my chart
[48:14] here I've got the very Foundation faith
[48:18] is the foundation of all of it
[48:21] for without faith it is impossible to
[48:24] please God you say that word impossible
[48:26] right right without faith it's
[48:28] impossible you cannot please God any
[48:31] other way
[48:32] but by faith
[48:34] that's right all right for without faith
[48:36] it's impossible to please God he that
[48:37] cometh to God must believe that he is
[48:40] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[48:43] seek him there's your reward
[48:45] see he must be and when you're a skeptic
[48:48] of the Bible when you're skeptic of the
[48:50] word being right you just might as well
[48:52] stay back until first you believe it so
[48:55] don't try to go up this pyramid without
[48:57] first knowing that you're born again
[48:59] know that you've got the faith of God
[49:02] and then when God gives the faith to you
[49:04] who is it it's yours right so then it
[49:06] says add to your faith all right what is
[49:09] sin unbelief
[49:11] watch here this is what I want you to
[49:13] see this he Nails it right here this to
[49:15] me nails the whole thing
[49:17] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[49:20] elements that control the human being so
[49:22] let's cut everything out except two
[49:24] things exactly that's either doubt or
[49:28] faith not doubt and Faith doubt our
[49:30] faith one or the other
[49:33] right you're possessed
[49:36] right
[49:37] you're possessed of one that dominates
[49:42] your life
[49:45] just depends on how much Faith you have
[49:50] how high you can rise he nailed it right
[49:55] there
[49:56] according to how much Faith you have
[49:58] is how high you can rise that's what
[50:01] he's talking about right is how high you
[50:04] can rise you say well I've got this
[50:06] temper my grandpa had it my granddaddy
[50:08] hadn't all that stuff and I've got it
[50:09] and ain't nothing to do about it well
[50:10] guess what
[50:11] ain't nothing going to do about it
[50:13] either right
[50:15] there's nothing God can do about it if
[50:16] that's what you're saying right right in
[50:18] other words it's like Daddy said you pet
[50:20] that devil you don't want to get rid of
[50:21] it
[50:26] but the requirements are that we do get
[50:28] rid of it amen
[50:30] amen the requirements are that we live
[50:31] in brotherly kindness godliness patience
[50:33] and all these things and we'll get into
[50:36] that later I just want to make sure that
[50:37] we see that this is number one
[50:40] very important it's the centerpiece of
[50:43] the message which takes us into the
[50:45] seals
[50:46] because the seals is for the Redemption
[50:48] of the body well if you can't get these
[50:50] things under control here how in the
[50:52] world that's why it tickles me with with
[50:55] ministers in the in the message that are
[50:57] that are preaching the third poll and
[50:59] preaching on The Headstone and preach
[51:00] that's good
[51:03] but if they got the virtues working in
[51:04] their life
[51:05] are they at the faith of the fathers or
[51:08] do they know that that they have so much
[51:11] brotherly kindness and godliness until
[51:13] God is doing the thing in their life
[51:14] that they're supposed to right
[51:17] okay
[51:19] okay cause that's got to come first
[51:21] God's plan is not is you get Faith and
[51:23] then you just jump all the way up to the
[51:24] headstone
[51:25] it's not
[51:27] but remember
[51:28] the third pull is the opening of the
[51:30] word
[51:32] but so was the first and second pull
[51:34] all right and then I've heard people
[51:35] preach at third pool is a new birth well
[51:40] the new birth contains the third pull
[51:44] it's the third pull is not all the new
[51:46] birth yeah
[51:48] nobody understand that let me say it one
[51:49] more time the third pull is in that new
[51:52] birth that you have
[51:54] okay it's in there
[51:55] but it's not totally all it
[51:58] right because if you say that then then
[52:00] Paul had the third pull working in his
[52:02] life in the first church age which he
[52:03] did not
[52:06] irenius Martin Columbus
[52:09] and that's what I want to I want explain
[52:11] something here we were looking at the
[52:13] doing the dimensions of the city and
[52:15] we'll get into that you know a long time
[52:17] from now the city Foursquare that's
[52:19] going to be a big place to live
[52:22] probably 90 percent of the people born
[52:25] again Christian
[52:27] bride with white raiment with the crown
[52:31] with being priests and Kings all the
[52:34] things that it says about us
[52:36] never even seen this chart
[52:42] never heard of William Branham
[52:44] never heard of the message of the hour
[52:46] yeah
[52:48] Paul didn't know anything about brother
[52:49] Ryan
[52:51] Wesley didn't know nothing about brother
[52:53] Branham but yet they're going to be
[52:55] there
[52:56] what I'm saying is this this part of
[52:59] this message
[53:00] is not new
[53:03] it's been around since Paul was here
[53:07] and God has made provision for this to
[53:09] work in people's life all down through
[53:12] the seven Church ages the only thing we
[53:15] as the Bride of this day is standing
[53:18] needing
[53:19] is this
[53:21] I sure we need this but unless if we get
[53:24] this that's the next thing that's coming
[53:26] that headstone to be put back onto the
[53:29] church bringing that man back
[53:32] brother Dale's the fullness of the
[53:34] godhead bodily now if he was the
[53:37] fullness of the godhead bodily
[53:39] 2000 years ago the man I'm talking about
[53:41] him
[53:42] he was the fullness of the godhead
[53:43] bothered two thousand years ago
[53:45] if that was the son of man Ministry and
[53:47] that's the son of man that took a change
[53:49] that same man's got to be back here
[53:54] I swear we're missing it that same man's
[53:56] got to be back here amen but not in one
[53:59] person anymore because when he came back
[54:01] on the day of Pentecost he divided
[54:03] himself
[54:05] and it and Paul there's no way that Paul
[54:08] could have the fullness of the godhead
[54:09] bodily Irene is Martin all the way up
[54:11] until this age now we can have the
[54:14] fullness
[54:15] that that means that that man can come
[54:18] back in a group of people
[54:20] living in a group of people but the son
[54:23] of man Ministry had to be back sure he
[54:26] lived in the people down Through the
[54:27] Ages
[54:28] Son of God as the spirit God we're going
[54:31] to see me no more I read it the world
[54:32] see me no more but you'll see me
[54:35] but in the end time he's got to come
[54:37] back not literally as a person
[54:40] but he's so literal in his bride because
[54:43] all the other ages couldn't put it
[54:45] together
[54:47] they'd lose something here there'd be a
[54:49] piece off here there'd be a piece of the
[54:50] building they couldn't do a Paul said I
[54:52] looked through a glass Darkly but he
[54:54] said what I see Jesus
[54:55] in other words I'm looking to the author
[54:57] and finisher of my faith but we're
[54:59] standing right here looking at the altar
[55:01] in the finisher of the faith right here
[55:03] today the son of man Ministry now that's
[55:05] getting way on Down the Line because we
[55:07] got to have all these first
[55:09] but the importance of that is we can't
[55:10] have that without having this
[55:13] this has got to be back in action and it
[55:16] is
[55:19] but not in his fullness God wants
[55:21] everybody to be adopted God wants
[55:23] everybody to to have enough godliness
[55:26] and patience and Temperance to act like
[55:28] God
[55:30] the book of Ephesus remember they were
[55:32] called Christians because they acted
[55:33] like the man that walked on the Earth
[55:36] black brother what brother William say
[55:38] he's talking about being Christians or
[55:40] being religious
[55:41] the devil is religious but he can't be a
[55:43] Christian right
[55:45] there's no way the devil can be
[55:46] christ-like
[55:48] now he can be close
[55:50] but he can be very religious
[55:53] so I don't want to be called a religious
[55:54] person
[55:55] come on the people in Ephesus were
[55:57] called Christians because the people
[55:58] looked at him and said you act just like
[56:00] that man that was here 40 years ago or
[56:03] 50 years ago and that's the way we've
[56:05] got to be we've got to be to where we
[56:06] act like that man that was walking on
[56:08] the face of the Earth
[56:10] 2000 years ago
[56:14] that's power with character amen right
[56:17] right that's power with character
[56:20] everything's coming together in the end
[56:21] time
[56:23] we can't short ourselves
[56:26] but even as we come up to the new birth
[56:30] that's not all God requires right
[56:33] he requires more
[56:36] because we do have
[56:38] memory reason conscious affection and
[56:42] Imagination we've got that Spirit realm
[56:44] that we have to deal with because
[56:47] remember in your soul it's either Faith
[56:50] or doubt not faith and doubt one more
[56:53] time it's not faith and doubt right it's
[56:56] Faith or doubt
[56:58] okay
[56:59] you doubted when you were born and come
[57:01] up and before you got born again you
[57:04] were a doubter
[57:07] right then when Faith come
[57:10] you become a believer
[57:13] it's pretty simple
[57:15] but the people in the message most of
[57:16] them have faith and doubt in there can't
[57:19] have faith and doubt right it's Faith or
[57:21] doubt now what happens is you may have
[57:24] you got faith inside there but that
[57:26] doubt comes out a little bit into that
[57:27] next Realm
[57:29] because where do you doubt from now your
[57:31] memory reason conscious affection
[57:32] imagination that's where you doubt from
[57:34] if you're born again in your soul that
[57:36] Soul can't doubt right
[57:39] right but it's got to go through so many
[57:40] filters to get down in there
[57:43] I'm trying to find that quote where
[57:45] brother Brown said somehow the Holy
[57:47] Ghost gets into your soul but yeah it's
[57:49] not worded right but he said somehow he
[57:52] said it takes a miracle and that's what
[57:54] it does it takes a miracle because
[57:55] you're a miracle
[57:56] all right it's a miracle how this thing
[57:58] works so what we're going to do now is
[58:02] we've set them we've set the tone
[58:04] the introduction is that we need this
[58:07] it's a requirement
[58:10] it's it's required for graduation
[58:13] so it's a required subject it's
[58:15] something that we must have and we must
[58:17] teach it correctly
[58:19] but it also requires you
[58:22] to have a desire to want it right okay
[58:25] and if you have the new birth you do
[58:27] have the desire to want it
[58:30] right if you have the new birth you
[58:32] might you've got to have that desire now
[58:34] whether you suppress it or not it's your
[58:36] business it's according to how much
[58:38] Faith you got is how high you'll go
[58:40] all right because remember brother Madam
[58:42] preached the message doors indoors
[58:45] you let God in your house
[58:48] right right so you're born again he let
[58:50] you let God in the house
[58:52] but you say God now don't go behind that
[58:54] door right there
[58:56] he made it doubt and fear and self or
[58:59] something else he made several different
[59:01] things he's because remember he said the
[59:03] Holy Ghost is timid see if it'd be me
[59:05] and you see this is power without
[59:06] character
[59:08] you walk in somebody's house you say
[59:09] what's behind that door yeah what we got
[59:12] behind that door let me see what's
[59:14] behind that door
[59:16] right not the Holy Ghost
[59:18] he said you got the door shut that's
[59:20] fine I won't do anything I'll wait on
[59:22] you because brother Ramsay he's a
[59:24] gentleman
[59:25] now if you say okay you can go in that
[59:27] door you open that door
[59:29] and you open that door and you open that
[59:31] door and you open that door if you don't
[59:33] want him to take your ungodly temper
[59:35] away from me he won't
[59:37] right if that's what you got to deal
[59:39] with we all got certain things we all
[59:40] got all these to deal with it's just
[59:42] certain levels we have to deal with them
[59:43] at all right
[59:45] um
[59:47] I told him downstairs Temperance and
[59:49] patience is probably two of the worst
[59:50] they're sitting right there beside each
[59:51] other and you you can kind of
[59:52] interchange them but
[59:55] let's read this I think they're going to
[59:57] pull it up
[59:58] this is on Blasphemous names and it's a
[1:00:01] pretty long read but I want you this is
[1:00:02] Brother Branham
[1:00:04] everybody has ever read sister Shepard's
[1:00:07] dream
[1:00:08] sister Shepherd's Dream came before
[1:00:11] before the statue of perfect man was
[1:00:13] preached but he said and I don't know if
[1:00:15] I got it in here I kind of edited some
[1:00:17] of this out for saving time
[1:00:19] but what happened was she told Brother
[1:00:20] Brown of the dream right before he
[1:00:22] preached statue of perfect man but they
[1:00:24] didn't have it written down where he
[1:00:26] could read it so he waited till the next
[1:00:28] week on Blasphemous names and read it
[1:00:31] and saw that how it went so well with
[1:00:33] what he was preaching the statue of
[1:00:35] perfect man so let's read it I think
[1:00:36] they have it back there
[1:00:38] it's kind of a long read but you know
[1:00:40] about 15 minutes we should be done I'm
[1:00:42] gonna try to keep holding to my hour and
[1:00:44] 10.
[1:00:45] Blasphemous names
[1:00:48] Jeffersonville 1962 1104 it was the week
[1:00:51] after he preached
[1:00:54] the week after he preached it
[1:00:56] Anderson you sleep
[1:01:03] sister Skipper's Dream It's about there
[1:01:05] somewhere
[1:01:06] I'll start reading some of it now I'm
[1:01:08] backgrounding this so that you will see
[1:01:10] when the sister's dream is being told
[1:01:13] now these things here absolutely must be
[1:01:16] in the Christian before the holy ghost
[1:01:18] ever seals them amen you see that what
[1:01:21] he's talking about he's still got his
[1:01:22] chart up
[1:01:24] he'll refer to it in a minute he's still
[1:01:26] got his chart of the Statue of a perfect
[1:01:27] man up all right so he's referring to
[1:01:30] that chart
[1:01:32] brother Joey may not have it on there so
[1:01:34] that brother Joe knows where it is
[1:01:37] so now these things here absolutely must
[1:01:39] be in the Christian before the holy
[1:01:41] ghost ever seals them now he's not
[1:01:44] talking about the new birth
[1:01:46] he's talking about having the virtues
[1:01:47] and having the virtues sealed in you all
[1:01:50] right before this comes down on top and
[1:01:54] makes a complete unit everybody see what
[1:01:56] he's saying all right now our sister's
[1:01:59] dream now she was worried whether she
[1:02:01] had the holy ghost or not when she laid
[1:02:03] down across the dewfold where her
[1:02:05] husband was reading a paper and she got
[1:02:07] little ones as I have and they're always
[1:02:09] making noise and so in this she fell
[1:02:11] asleep for approximately 10 or 15
[1:02:13] minutes and she dreamed she never could
[1:02:16] understand it or get it all together
[1:02:17] from a year ago almost I'm sorry it was
[1:02:20] a year ago until this message
[1:02:23] paragraph 98 there you go
[1:02:26] almost until this message was taught
[1:02:28] then while I was teaching it it all came
[1:02:30] back to her that's what it was and she
[1:02:32] dreamed that she was praying
[1:02:35] all right
[1:02:38] keep going up to uh
[1:02:40] 99. there you go all right
[1:02:44] 99 there you go she was walking the
[1:02:46] floor first before she dreamed and
[1:02:48] ringing her hand saying Lord have I got
[1:02:50] the Holy Ghost can you prove it to me
[1:02:52] prove to me some says some say it's
[1:02:55] because that or that I shouted or some
[1:02:57] said because I spoke in tongues and we
[1:02:59] believe in all that but have I really
[1:03:00] got it
[1:03:03] I believe in all those things paragraph
[1:03:06] 100 keep reading those verses speaking
[1:03:08] in tongues shouting all kinds of
[1:03:10] demonstrations I believe in every bit of
[1:03:11] that but if it's there without this
[1:03:14] I believe he's talking about this
[1:03:16] because he's still got his chart there
[1:03:18] if it's there without this there's
[1:03:20] something wrong see and I see you see
[1:03:22] you you got a shell notice and she was
[1:03:25] worried about it she just laid down
[1:03:27] across the dewfo which her husband was
[1:03:28] reading and she went to sleep
[1:03:30] and she dreamed she was up on the
[1:03:32] mountain now remember I want you to
[1:03:34] listen for a minute
[1:03:35] she dreamed she was up on the mountain
[1:03:37] but she didn't stay up there
[1:03:39] she came back down
[1:03:41] okay
[1:03:43] don't want you to get because some
[1:03:44] people think well she was up on the
[1:03:45] mountain she had all these virtues no
[1:03:46] just watch what he's watch what he's
[1:03:48] saying you have to kind of read slow
[1:03:52] and I think slow so it kind of helped me
[1:03:54] and she dreamed she was up on the
[1:03:56] mountain
[1:03:58] and in this mountain the best I haven't
[1:04:00] got the paper before me but I think it's
[1:04:02] like this she dreamed that she saw a
[1:04:03] rock box
[1:04:05] like a framework sitting right on top of
[1:04:07] this mountain
[1:04:08] and her husband was just behind her and
[1:04:10] she saw a large man standing there with
[1:04:12] work clothes on sleeves rolled up
[1:04:15] bailing the most pure water that she
[1:04:18] ever seen now think of the scene of a
[1:04:20] man standing right here because the Box
[1:04:22] the box is going to be right here
[1:04:26] we're going to keep reading but the box
[1:04:28] is right here because he's gonna he's
[1:04:30] gonna nail it with brotherly kindness so
[1:04:32] the box is right here there's a man
[1:04:34] standing here on this mountain pouring
[1:04:36] water into the box
[1:04:38] everybody got that same
[1:04:40] man pouring water into a box right on
[1:04:42] top of that all right
[1:04:45] so a large man standing with work
[1:04:46] clothes on sleeves rolled up Banning the
[1:04:48] most pure water she ever seen pouring
[1:04:50] into this box this Rock Box sitting on
[1:04:53] top of the mountain
[1:04:54] and The Rock Box would not hold the
[1:04:56] water and it rolled right out of there
[1:04:59] and just boiled up listen
[1:05:03] boiled up trash
[1:05:07] and sticks
[1:05:10] now you're gonna find out a minute she's
[1:05:11] already born again
[1:05:13] but where the water is coming in is
[1:05:15] right here and what's it doing it's
[1:05:16] bubbling out and pouring down over the
[1:05:18] mountain
[1:05:20] so you think we still got rocks and
[1:05:22] sticks in US yeah we still got rocks and
[1:05:24] sticks
[1:05:25] but that's what this statue of perfect
[1:05:27] man is doing it's not cleaning your soul
[1:05:29] out your souls as clean as it'll ever be
[1:05:33] hey if you're born again your souls is
[1:05:35] clean it don't need this
[1:05:39] but it's so captured by what we have on
[1:05:44] the outside it's it's like a capsule
[1:05:48] well the the ways of sin and all the
[1:05:51] things of the world and the junk that we
[1:05:52] go go through there's a lot of filters
[1:05:54] for it to go through but the the Holy
[1:05:57] Ghost is not it's not boiling the trash
[1:05:59] out of her soul
[1:06:01] it's boiled up all the trash and sticks
[1:06:03] and everything in there
[1:06:06] and boil it out and rolled it down the
[1:06:09] mountain
[1:06:10] and it rolled over her feet and she was
[1:06:12] standing right in that stuff only it
[1:06:14] didn't stick to her
[1:06:17] right and then she asked why the Box
[1:06:19] didn't hold it and the man said this is
[1:06:21] not water
[1:06:22] this is the Holy Ghost
[1:06:24] so the man's pouring the Holy Ghost down
[1:06:26] into here
[1:06:28] and what's it boy it's boiling all the
[1:06:30] trash out and down the mountain
[1:06:34] George ball in the trash I I love this
[1:06:36] because and I know brother Brandon was
[1:06:38] shouting inside for sure nothing will
[1:06:40] hold it and said then he went back and
[1:06:42] got another big bucket and it was full
[1:06:45] of honey
[1:06:47] and poured the honey in there said now
[1:06:51] it will hold this
[1:06:53] and she thought that the box was a rock
[1:06:55] box
[1:06:56] was going to burst out and spill the
[1:06:59] honey but it didn't it finally stuck
[1:07:01] together and held it right all right
[1:07:05] she turned and went down the mountain so
[1:07:07] see she had to go back down she went got
[1:07:09] down the mountain going down the
[1:07:10] mountain she stopped at the bottom of
[1:07:12] the mountain and looked back
[1:07:14] she saw five streams of pure Crystal
[1:07:16] Water not contaminated by the things
[1:07:18] that it had went through
[1:07:21] still pure and clean coming swiftly then
[1:07:24] it slowed down almost faded out and she
[1:07:26] was wondering would it ever reach the
[1:07:28] bottom of the mountain five streams and
[1:07:30] she woke up
[1:07:32] I think that's just about as close to
[1:07:33] being right isn't that sister Shepard
[1:07:35] because she was there in the meeting
[1:07:37] now no more than I picked up the letter
[1:07:39] and opened it before I read it I saw her
[1:07:41] dream that's what a prophet does the
[1:07:43] prophet sees the vision all right seize
[1:07:45] the dream that's the way dreams are
[1:07:47] interpreted now many of you has come to
[1:07:49] me with dreams and say things to me
[1:07:50] about dreams I say wait a minute you
[1:07:52] never told it all see and go back and
[1:07:54] pick it up then if you can't tell what
[1:07:56] you dream how you know the
[1:07:57] interpretation is right or not see
[1:07:59] you've got to see that's what Daniel got
[1:08:02] into
[1:08:03] with interpreting dreams Daniel
[1:08:04] interpret those dreams he would see the
[1:08:06] dreams and he'd tell them the dream and
[1:08:07] they knew exactly that it was true
[1:08:09] because he told them the very Vision
[1:08:10] that they had in Daniel back in the in
[1:08:14] the Old Testament you've got to you've
[1:08:16] got to see the dream a vision has to
[1:08:18] show the dream and when you see the
[1:08:19] dream that the person dreamed and can
[1:08:21] tell them before they tell you then you
[1:08:23] know the interpretation all right now
[1:08:26] here is the interpretation of her dream
[1:08:27] so it's got to be right because you just
[1:08:29] said it was she was bothered about the
[1:08:31] Holy Spirit now there's so much that
[1:08:33] she's seen the box in the top of the
[1:08:34] mountain was the rock rock box is Rock
[1:08:36] confession
[1:08:38] now like Jesus said in the scripture he
[1:08:39] said Peter said who Jesus said who does
[1:08:41] man say I the son of man am one said
[1:08:44] Thou Art Elias and Moses and so forth
[1:08:47] and he said but who do you say I am he
[1:08:49] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:08:50] Living God
[1:08:51] now we're going to go back to here now
[1:08:53] some people say now the Catholic Church
[1:08:55] says the Roman Catholic Church said that
[1:08:56] his The Rock was that Jesus said Upon
[1:08:59] This Rock I'll be on my church and the
[1:09:00] Gates of Hell will not Prevail against
[1:09:01] it they said it was upon Peter and Peter
[1:09:04] was that rock because Peter means a
[1:09:06] little Stone upon this little Stone I'll
[1:09:07] build my church and upon Peter they
[1:09:09] Apostolic secession they built the
[1:09:11] church then the Protestant Church says
[1:09:13] that's wrong that it was upon himself he
[1:09:16] built the church talking about Jesus now
[1:09:17] not to be disagreeable but to me my way
[1:09:20] of seeing it it's both wrong because he
[1:09:22] never built it upon Peter neither did he
[1:09:24] build it upon himself right
[1:09:27] right because he was just not a man
[1:09:32] but it's upon Peter's revelation of who
[1:09:35] he was
[1:09:36] exactly okay Peter's revelation of who
[1:09:38] he was
[1:09:40] all right
[1:09:41] Dr Christ is under the Living God
[1:09:44] bless the Lord thou Simon son of Jonas
[1:09:46] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:09:47] you some Seminary see but my Father
[1:09:49] which is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:09:51] you there Peter Upon This Rock of
[1:09:53] confession upon this Revelation I'll
[1:09:54] build my church and that's been each
[1:09:56] Church age has had that rock confession
[1:09:58] on up to this rock confession of the
[1:10:01] laodicea right up to the top because
[1:10:03] remember when he poured the water down
[1:10:05] in it went down in here and he'd come
[1:10:07] back out so the Holy Ghost covered every
[1:10:09] age
[1:10:11] and now you cannot make a holy church
[1:10:12] there's no such thing as the holy church
[1:10:14] or a holy organization right the Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit can be preached in it but in
[1:10:18] there you find good and bad Renegades
[1:10:20] indifferent and everything else
[1:10:22] so an organization will not hold you
[1:10:25] can't say we got it none of the rest of
[1:10:26] them has it no sir the holy spirit is
[1:10:29] poured out on individuals it's the
[1:10:32] individual
[1:10:33] so therefore the rock this Latter Day
[1:10:35] Pentecostal Church which has received
[1:10:37] the Holy Spirit they did at the site
[1:10:39] they did have received the Holy Ghost as
[1:10:41] they did at the first all down Through
[1:10:43] the Ages they received the Holy Spirit
[1:10:45] but not in the measure that they have it
[1:10:48] now
[1:10:49] right okay because it's a restoration of
[1:10:51] the first
[1:10:53] just like we took the picture with the
[1:10:55] with the
[1:10:56] Cornerstone it's restoring it back to
[1:10:59] the headstone all right as we take the
[1:11:02] candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they
[1:11:04] lit the first candle and it went higher
[1:11:05] and higher got dimmer and dimmer then
[1:11:07] comes back again see first and last and
[1:11:09] so forth
[1:11:11] now but in this church age the message
[1:11:13] is being poured into the church but the
[1:11:15] church body itself is all together like
[1:11:18] the this Tabernacle will say that's
[1:11:20] where she comes to church this
[1:11:21] Tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[1:11:22] Tabernacle there's no such a thing
[1:11:25] individuals that come into this church
[1:11:28] is Holy Ghost Tabernacles
[1:11:30] they are Tabernacles that contain the
[1:11:32] Holy Ghost that's right but not the
[1:11:34] church in the body a group therefore it
[1:11:36] runs out but what this man who was
[1:11:39] pouring the water the messenger to the
[1:11:41] church so who was it he just didn't want
[1:11:43] to tell the people it was him it was him
[1:11:46] standing there with his sleeves rolled
[1:11:47] up in the work clothes all right he just
[1:11:49] didn't say but he said the messenger to
[1:11:51] the church
[1:11:51] pouring the message into the church but
[1:11:55] what was the water doing
[1:11:58] boiling out all the trash that was in it
[1:12:02] that's what the Holy Spirit does balls
[1:12:04] it up now now the honey represented
[1:12:08] brotherly love that's the last thing see
[1:12:10] this is we're going to see in later on
[1:12:12] this is your hinge point this is if you
[1:12:15] can't get past that
[1:12:18] because look The Headstone won't fit
[1:12:20] down here
[1:12:23] it fits right there
[1:12:25] so you got to have that all right so
[1:12:27] that's what he's saying right here watch
[1:12:29] now the honey represented Brotherly Love
[1:12:31] brotherly kindness which is this age I
[1:12:33] just got through telling see a brother
[1:12:34] kindness the angel we live in now
[1:12:36] you might say look I sure I don't I
[1:12:39] don't like brother Neville or so don't
[1:12:40] like brother Jones I don't like brothers
[1:12:42] so-and-so and something like that but
[1:12:44] just let something happen to him brother
[1:12:45] your heart's broke and just nearly
[1:12:47] killed you see we can obtain brotherly
[1:12:49] kindness and feel for one another but to
[1:12:51] maintain in a group of people
[1:12:54] look he's saying something watch we can
[1:12:57] obtain brotherly kindness and feelings
[1:12:58] for one another see but to maintain in a
[1:13:01] group of people right bunch of people
[1:13:02] right to maintain a group of people he's
[1:13:04] saying it's going to be hard right why
[1:13:06] do you care for that brother because
[1:13:08] you've broken bread with him here at the
[1:13:09] altar or you will tonight your
[1:13:10] fellowship with him you shook his hand
[1:13:12] you worship with him he's your brother
[1:13:13] and you might do something in the flesh
[1:13:15] that you would disagree with but you
[1:13:17] just kind of stay which you ought to uh
[1:13:19] to do but shun him a little but in the
[1:13:22] bottom of your heart if something
[1:13:23] happened to that brother it would just
[1:13:24] nearly kill your or that sister I'm an
[1:13:26] old man I was once young now I'm old
[1:13:28] I've seen it down through the age do
[1:13:30] that hear people say I won't have no
[1:13:33] more to do with him and something
[1:13:34] happened to that man it nearly kills him
[1:13:35] he thinks oh God I let my precious
[1:13:37] brother go without making friends with
[1:13:39] him you see see it's brotherly love it
[1:13:41] looks like it won't stick but it does
[1:13:43] stick the honey sticks
[1:13:47] now look here's what he's telling her
[1:13:49] now in so much that she come down from
[1:13:51] there down the hill to the bottom of the
[1:13:53] hill now this glorious water was gushing
[1:13:55] over Hills in five strands now five is
[1:13:57] the number of grapes
[1:14:00] j-e-s-u-s-f-a-r-t-h-g-r-a-c-sc five is
[1:14:02] the number of Grace five strains were
[1:14:04] pouring from up here at the trough down
[1:14:07] through here
[1:14:10] each one of these ages has that rock
[1:14:11] confession the saints were sleeping
[1:14:13] waiting waiting waiting to see on till
[1:14:15] this age but soon the Holy Ghost being
[1:14:17] poured out from Christ will come and
[1:14:19] will seal up his church
[1:14:21] now you're not talking about the New
[1:14:22] Birth here
[1:14:24] he's talking about that Holy Spirit
[1:14:25] right there this is jumping a little
[1:14:27] head but this is the whole dream we're
[1:14:29] going to tell the whole dream and then
[1:14:30] we'll start over again but soon the Holy
[1:14:32] Ghost being poured out from Christ
[1:14:34] will come and we'll seal up the church
[1:14:36] then the church will be raptured it will
[1:14:39] be a complete unit of God a bride for
[1:14:41] Christ who will be the head of all
[1:14:43] things you follow me now congregation
[1:14:45] says amen
[1:14:46] now she was wondering now in Her Dream
[1:14:48] she was wondering would this little
[1:14:50] stream with this little stream ever get
[1:14:51] to the bottom see it was drying up now
[1:14:53] being that she herself now here's what I
[1:14:55] want to get to you now she herself was
[1:14:57] wondering about her own self did she
[1:14:59] have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] now I shouldn't saying this a few days
[1:15:04] ago thinking that the church would be
[1:15:05] spiritual enough to catch it and maybe I
[1:15:08] better turn this tape off right now
[1:15:10] because I don't want it to get out
[1:15:12] amongst Brethren but you could speak
[1:15:14] with tongues you can shout You Can Dance
[1:15:16] you can cast out Devils do anything you
[1:15:18] want to and still not have the Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost
[1:15:22] didn't them disciples come back rejoice
[1:15:24] and shouting becomes the devil was
[1:15:25] subject to them and Jesus right among
[1:15:27] them was Judas amen did not Jesus say in
[1:15:30] that day when he come that day many will
[1:15:32] come to me and say Lord
[1:15:33] have not I cast out devils in your name
[1:15:36] done many mighty works and I'll say
[1:15:38] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[1:15:40] didn't know you these things are not
[1:15:42] indications of the Holy Spirit right
[1:15:45] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:15:48] right now you say brother Branham do we
[1:15:51] should we speak in tongues absolutely
[1:15:52] that's gifts of God but those gifts of
[1:15:54] God without these virtues listen
[1:15:56] but these gifts of God without these
[1:15:58] virtues in them makes a stumble block to
[1:16:01] the unbeliever
[1:16:03] it's not accepted by God exactly right
[1:16:06] you see that
[1:16:08] those gifts of God
[1:16:11] without these virtues in them makes a
[1:16:15] stumble block to the unbeliever it's not
[1:16:18] accepted by God
[1:16:20] this has to be first amen I believe he's
[1:16:24] pointing to that because Seacoast said
[1:16:26] and when you have faith virtue and all
[1:16:27] these temples patience Godless and
[1:16:29] brotherly kindness then the Holy Ghost
[1:16:31] comes down and seals you as a unit
[1:16:34] the same as he seals the church ages as
[1:16:36] a unit the way he makes his bride is the
[1:16:39] way he makes his individual made out of
[1:16:41] the same material like Eve was made out
[1:16:43] of Adam a rib from the side here is the
[1:16:46] thing that you have to have first
[1:16:49] I think he's pointing to that
[1:16:51] here is the things that you have to have
[1:16:53] first you can't impersonate them you
[1:16:56] cannot imitate them they've got to be
[1:16:59] god-sent and God born right imitation
[1:17:03] only causes confusion
[1:17:06] and that's our problem
[1:17:08] we've had a lot of imitation and a lot
[1:17:10] of confusion it's like I said could you
[1:17:11] imagine seeing a buzzard sitting there
[1:17:13] with a dove feather stuck in his wing
[1:17:15] saying see I'm a dove he's not a w the
[1:17:17] Buzzard could you imagine a black bird
[1:17:19] with a peacock feather in his wings say
[1:17:20] see that's something that he's stuck in
[1:17:23] but it has to come from the inside out
[1:17:26] and it produces Christianity God by the
[1:17:30] power of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:32] our sister had her feet wet when she got
[1:17:34] to the bottom all of us know Sister
[1:17:36] Shepherd to be charitable and he talks
[1:17:38] about opening up her house and all that
[1:17:40] oh God accepted that her foundation part
[1:17:43] see look she fed the people she shared
[1:17:45] form look whatever it is they'll feed
[1:17:47] them do anything they can to help them
[1:17:48] oh God oh God accepted that her
[1:17:52] foundation part
[1:17:54] that's down here this is the foundation
[1:17:56] part he accepted that
[1:17:58] all right
[1:18:03] and here's now get this lesson here's
[1:18:05] what's wrong with the I turn on for this
[1:18:08] here's what's wrong with the Branham
[1:18:09] Tabernacle you see there's two different
[1:18:11] kinds of Faith right
[1:18:13] there's two different kinds of virtue
[1:18:17] as I had it the other day two different
[1:18:19] kinds of knowledge
[1:18:20] two different kinds of temperance
[1:18:23] one thinks it's prohibition they got
[1:18:27] that ain't the kind of temperance that
[1:18:29] God's talking about
[1:18:30] it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper
[1:18:33] you've got and things of that side fast
[1:18:36] back fuss
[1:18:37] patience and so forth there's a mockery
[1:18:39] of it a pretend to be a nature given
[1:18:42] Faith a nature given virtue there's a
[1:18:45] nature given Temperance all these things
[1:18:47] are nature given and the biggest part of
[1:18:50] our faith look at the biggest part of
[1:18:51] our faith is mental faith
[1:18:53] okay by hearing the word it brings us to
[1:18:56] a mental recognition of God
[1:18:59] but if this coming from above
[1:19:03] oh brother if it ever strikes this
[1:19:05] there's a Godly spiritual face I believe
[1:19:08] he's talking about up there
[1:19:10] coming from above oh brother if it ever
[1:19:13] strikes this
[1:19:15] there's a Godly spiritual faith
[1:19:18] then what does that Faith do that Faith
[1:19:21] recognizes only the word amen
[1:19:24] amen no matter what anything else says
[1:19:26] it only recognizes a word because in the
[1:19:28] beginning was the word words with God
[1:19:30] the Word was God and the word is still
[1:19:32] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:19:34] dwelt Among Us and when the word itself
[1:19:36] is pouring into our faith our mental
[1:19:39] Faith becomes a spiritual revelation
[1:19:42] and upon this Foundation I'll build my
[1:19:44] church not upon a mental conception of
[1:19:47] church joining a mental conception of
[1:19:49] that but upon the Revelation when them
[1:19:51] streams of Grace has poured into that
[1:19:54] mental faith that you've got then upon
[1:19:57] this a spiritual Revelation I'll build
[1:19:59] my church in case they won't Prevail
[1:20:00] against it that shows they would be
[1:20:02] against it but it'll never Prevail oh
[1:20:04] what a glorious thing now you see the
[1:20:06] faith these five strengths
[1:20:09] he's talking about bringing a piece of
[1:20:10] chalk to to do some writing but what but
[1:20:13] the five streams you see coming down
[1:20:14] through here tempers this together it's
[1:20:17] been the Holy Ghost holy spirit that
[1:20:19] made the Ephesian church it was the Holy
[1:20:21] Spirit that birth
[1:20:23] this morning church the holy spirit that
[1:20:25] give the Perkins Church the entire
[1:20:27] church in the Dark Ages it's the Holy
[1:20:28] Spirit that's building that bride built
[1:20:31] that bride the elect that's pulled out
[1:20:32] of all the organization systems down
[1:20:34] Through the Ages like that there's an
[1:20:36] elected a predestinated bride of Jesus
[1:20:39] Christ that the Holy Spirit has called
[1:20:41] out the elect and it's been the Holy
[1:20:43] Ghost in This age that age that age he
[1:20:46] keeps going that that that that on up to
[1:20:48] the top the Holy Spirit
[1:20:50] and now as in the individuals these
[1:20:52] virtues and things are knowledge and
[1:20:54] Temperance is added to our faith then
[1:20:57] when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit
[1:21:00] cements it together
[1:21:02] there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:04] that's why it's so short today
[1:21:07] may you see here I got some text wrote
[1:21:09] down here let's see how the picture
[1:21:10] drawn out for a dream you can't see it
[1:21:12] from there now coming from the Holy
[1:21:14] Spirit what comes then when he will give
[1:21:16] it to you Supernatural faith
[1:21:20] spiritual faith that here at the bottom
[1:21:23] then that spiritual Faith recognizes
[1:21:26] only the word so how are you going to
[1:21:28] get the virtues only by the word amen
[1:21:30] all right no matter what anybody else
[1:21:32] says it don't it don't do no good that's
[1:21:34] all that only knows the word if somebody
[1:21:37] says the date of Miracles has passed
[1:21:39] that Faith only knows the word somebody
[1:21:41] says there's no such thing as a baptism
[1:21:43] of the Holy Ghost that Faith only knows
[1:21:45] the word that's real spiritual Faith you
[1:21:48] see see it only knows the word then that
[1:21:51] was number one
[1:21:53] that number one coming to you your
[1:21:55] mental Faith right here comes the Holy
[1:21:58] Spirit coming down into your mental
[1:22:00] Faith making it a spiritual Faith then
[1:22:03] the spiritual Faith only recognizes the
[1:22:05] word then he talks about two three four
[1:22:07] and all the way down all right from your
[1:22:09] faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in
[1:22:13] with Christ
[1:22:14] then you become one
[1:22:18] amen get these things out of my way it's
[1:22:21] hard on your arms talk about something
[1:22:22] else you become one see you and Christ
[1:22:24] live together
[1:22:26] at that day you'll know that I am in the
[1:22:28] Father the father in me I and you and
[1:22:31] you and me see that's the sealed unit
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:35] right see your Soul's sealed in when you
[1:22:37] get the new birth right your soul is
[1:22:39] sealed in with God Satan sailed out God
[1:22:42] sealed in but that's not in your
[1:22:44] memories and conscious affection
[1:22:45] imagination in that Spirit Realm because
[1:22:48] remember this thing out here is memory
[1:22:50] reason I mean is a seed tastes feel
[1:22:53] smelling hair it only reacts to those
[1:22:55] two zones inside right it has it does
[1:22:57] not it's actually amoral just like the
[1:23:01] brick
[1:23:03] this body of mine can't sin
[1:23:05] that's right that's right unless I make
[1:23:08] it
[1:23:09] that's right right
[1:23:14] think about that
[1:23:17] think about it
[1:23:21] but our problem is our second realm
[1:23:24] memory reason conscious effects and
[1:23:26] Imagination that's where we have to deal
[1:23:29] with these and that's what we're going
[1:23:30] to deal with each one then that's a
[1:23:32] sealed unit of the Lord God now he's
[1:23:34] talking about right here now that's why
[1:23:35] he put that Holy Spirit right there
[1:23:37] because it's got to seal all this in
[1:23:39] right
[1:23:40] all right
[1:23:43] and then they are Vindicated and placed
[1:23:47] when that time takes place they become
[1:23:50] Vindicated
[1:23:51] not Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:23:52] Vindicated
[1:23:54] Sons and Daughters of God because you
[1:23:56] know you're a Son of God or a daughter
[1:23:57] of God right here
[1:23:59] right but you're a Vindicated son and
[1:24:02] daughter of God the world knows
[1:24:06] the world knows who you are
[1:24:10] you know why they kill Peter and them
[1:24:13] because they were Vindicated
[1:24:16] because they had this right here where I
[1:24:18] mean Peter had this in his life he was
[1:24:20] Vindicated that's why they killed him
[1:24:23] right because he was a Vindicated Son of
[1:24:25] God
[1:24:26] you and I
[1:24:29] have not only just got to have the new
[1:24:31] birth
[1:24:34] which is number one requirement
[1:24:39] but the requirement now is is to let
[1:24:42] that new birth work out that's right
[1:24:45] let that new birth work out right and
[1:24:49] it's like I was talking to a a brother
[1:24:51] the other day he said I can't stop X
[1:24:55] or what you know put it whatever your
[1:24:58] problem is or his was I can't stop acts
[1:25:01] I said well
[1:25:03] if it you know if it was you know
[1:25:05] something and he
[1:25:07] I said well
[1:25:10] they don't bring them to your house and
[1:25:11] give them to you
[1:25:12] you got to go buy them
[1:25:15] and I said you don't have people buying
[1:25:16] them for you so you're the one that goes
[1:25:18] and buys them cigarettes or whatever
[1:25:19] right they don't bring them to your
[1:25:21] house I've never seen them deliver them
[1:25:23] to your house you gotta go get them just
[1:25:25] like you got to go obtain these virtues
[1:25:27] you have to go you have to Brother Brian
[1:25:29] said you have to go out on Satan's
[1:25:31] territory
[1:25:32] right you have to go out there so it's
[1:25:35] your free moral agency that goes out
[1:25:36] there and does the things and brother
[1:25:39] Brandon said one time he said if you're
[1:25:40] stingy
[1:25:42] do the vice versa
[1:25:44] you say well how's that
[1:25:46] you say well it's a demon well it's all
[1:25:48] a demon
[1:25:50] demons are talking to you right now
[1:25:52] okay
[1:25:54] demons are talking to you right now
[1:25:55] they're real
[1:25:57] but brother Brown said just do the vice
[1:25:58] versa if you stand you start giving
[1:26:00] money away
[1:26:02] if you got to go to the convenience
[1:26:03] store to buy you some cigarettes just
[1:26:04] need to quit going to convenience store
[1:26:06] or go over to the chewing gum aisle
[1:26:07] instead of going over there until God
[1:26:09] delivers you from that right right
[1:26:10] because remember
[1:26:14] you're not going to get rid of it unless
[1:26:15] you want to get rid of it
[1:26:17] nothing you do you're not going to get
[1:26:19] rid of nothing if you pick that thing
[1:26:21] and let it bother you you won't get rid
[1:26:24] of it if you like it
[1:26:27] right what God's got to do is is God's
[1:26:30] got to preach the thing out of you
[1:26:32] that's how you cast out Devils right
[1:26:36] right the word of God is how you cast
[1:26:37] out devil
[1:26:39] but these virtues
[1:26:41] are there people listen these virtues
[1:26:43] are there they're in you
[1:26:46] they're just ready to be
[1:26:51] manifested right
[1:26:53] right they're ready god listen God does
[1:26:57] not mind for us to call him and ask him
[1:27:02] but the Bible says speak to this
[1:27:04] mountain right
[1:27:05] the Bible says lay hands on the sick and
[1:27:07] they shall recover it doesn't say pray
[1:27:09] for them
[1:27:10] doesn't say shake them
[1:27:12] doesn't say knock them down
[1:27:14] and God's not death
[1:27:16] you don't have to scream and you know
[1:27:18] what I never heard of brother Branham or
[1:27:19] even Jesus Christ screaming at the Devil
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:22] I've heard preachers scream people and
[1:27:25] kick them and and that might be all
[1:27:27] right but I've never Jesus
[1:27:30] the demons are even so much when Jesus
[1:27:32] walked up to the demons they said you
[1:27:33] want us to leave
[1:27:36] he wants to leave in other words while
[1:27:38] you come here before your time you want
[1:27:40] us to leave and he said yeah he said
[1:27:42] leave and they said well can we go don't
[1:27:44] let's cast us out can we go over there
[1:27:45] in the swine Jesus said go on
[1:27:47] Jesus wasn't messing with him he knew
[1:27:49] who he was he didn't have to shake
[1:27:51] Legion and scream at him he said right
[1:27:53] what'd the Bible say go that's all Jesus
[1:27:56] said was go
[1:27:57] makes it Go and the Bible says resist
[1:28:00] the devil and he'll flee from me so how
[1:28:02] are you going to cast out devil resist
[1:28:04] him right resist that urge to do the
[1:28:07] things that you used to do before
[1:28:09] next week we'll get into Lord willing
[1:28:11] into justification and sanctification to
[1:28:14] get us into the body
[1:28:16] so that we can start talking but what we
[1:28:18] wanted to do today was just an
[1:28:19] introduction to show you number one how
[1:28:21] important this is right that is that
[1:28:23] it's not a it's not a what you call
[1:28:26] those things that you took it's not an
[1:28:28] elective
[1:28:29] remember in school you had things you
[1:28:31] had to take then you had some electives
[1:28:33] like basket weaving and all them
[1:28:35] football players take all that you know
[1:28:36] pottery and all that stuff
[1:28:39] but there's a required subject to
[1:28:42] graduate
[1:28:43] this is not an elective this is a
[1:28:45] required subject to graduate so we got
[1:28:47] to have these and you know what we got
[1:28:49] to graduate
