you understand it it's been told me that a lot of people are texting again so don't do that that's that's disrespectful to the services of the lord for you to sit and text and and do uh if something is so important that you know you can not do without your cell phones and texting then that's a different thing we have a telephone number that everybody's welcome to use to call and brother joe will answer the phone and deliver the message to you you know i know some people have said well you know so-and-so sick someone says this well they can get the message through back there but don't just sit there and text and talk on the phone and just you know do things and all because that's that's disrespectful uh you you're not supposed to do that uh you know you're supposed to be interested in what's going on yeah but so-and-so is trying to get in touch with me what you want a million dollars yeah i mean you know we've got a number back there if you somebody hit the lottery with life and talking about it today down there and i said that you know if you somebody hit a lottery call you know but don't text and backwards and forth that's disrespectful to the house of god now what we're doing here is to be with god in doing right now not to be done just to haphazardly are coming in and all like that and if you know i mean my family don't call me my family don't come to my house on sunday to visit why because they know i'm not going to be at home right and so you let people know well there's a phone number here to call there's a thing here that you can contact you know i mean that's that's that's it you know and all but then you're just sitting there and deliberately just texting me don't tell me you can you're interested in what's being said when you're texting to somebody you know whether it be kids or grown-ups it's not right so don't be doing it that's just disrespectful in the house of the lord amen so then we we go with that uh we made all the announcements everything remember brother forney will be with us lord willing this coming sunday and preaching for us and remember to pray for all of these things keep these in your mind of brother siriano hadn't heard anymore they're from him in the philippines but just remember those things and keep those in your mind and the family there of the brother that passed away brother kinser remember that family and he had two churches he's involved with so just remember those things and keep him in your prayer i mean them and your prayers the families and all the loved ones and all like that and just remember to pray for one another all right romans 8 and genesis 4. heavenly father we thank you lord we love you we thank you for your grace and love unto us and we just praise your great name we ask you now to be with us this afternoon as we try to speak about you may you come and open our eyes because that's the very desires of our heart lord is to be of use that someone else could see you what could be greater than to help somebody to see god and become a christian become a son and daughter of a living god what could be greater president of the united states no owner of the world now that wouldn't be no good it would just all be in doing in you lord we love you and we thank you and just come now and speak to us let your grace be sufficient to all of our needs in jesus name amen romans 8. we're sitting down here today having a good discussion i generally always slip away and and uh you know come up and try to take a nap because it's getting 73 sometimes you need those little power naps you know to do but we got to talking about the message today and i just sat down there with you so don't worry about it don't you worry about you're going to burden me with it i was having a good time i really was and brother tony talked more than i've ever heard him talk in his life so i appreciate it i enjoyed it i mean i sat there and just said come on you know this is this is something to just enjoy fellowshipping and don't worry about saying well i don't agree with you that don't bother me you know that doesn't bother me for you to look me in the face and say i don't agree with you you know because every day i didn't agree with myself either you know but you know just have a good time talking about the lord and and the things of what you see and fellowshipping because that's what it's all about we're going to have an eternity to do that with us together so why not enjoy here right okay romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren now remember that when we get on over into the begotten you know he's the firstborn all right we'll understand that one of these days more of whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us that's something isn't it okay we'll just read one scripture pick up our thought this afternoon and it'll be taken from genesis 4 and 15. and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we have we're trying to cover to the point and uh you know getting an understanding of the scriptures and the things of why that it would be a certain way see we we we kind of i say we we all do we kind of we get set in our ways southern says sought you know we get shot in their ways and and somebody crosses us it uh it kind of jiggles a little but that's good right you know and i don't mean that about uh discussing the message you're talking about i mean in the basis of of what i try to do sometimes preaching to you i try to bring out things that will make you interested enough to think interested enough to study interested enough to pray and to seek god and even if it's wrong the bible is always right he said there must need to be heresies among you that they that are proven may be made manifest well even if i preach wrong and you get what's right look at a great thing out of it all you know but we you know we try to do the best we can all right but i asked you this morning i kept asking a question and i'll keep asking it for a few services why does it say between thy seed speaking of the serpent you know and her seed speaking of the woman when the serpent the devil the serpent see it's not the beast that way it's the serpent that's being dealt with he doesn't have a literal seed his seed is unbelief and that's not a seed all right the only way it can become one even than anything is for us to receive it and and become a part of us all right but he doesn't have a seed see he's a spirit being we read this morning and doesn't have a seed all right the woman doesn't have a seed she has an egg but why does it speak of that and why is so much time spent by the prophet covering the seed of the woman right in answering to it when he states that this genesis 15 he said all bible scholars know that that's the first time that it's speaking of the coming of the christ the messiah the promised to be and that's why i was bringing it like i did for you to think about it that god didn't just leave us alone and throw us away when we sinned he was right there and he made an atonement through the animals took the skins made an atonement but that atonement was only a covering of the sin it could not eradicate it but it was speaking of a coming messiah right but not a direct we call it prophecy but when you come over to genesis 2 and or 3 and 15 then it's a direct prophecy nailing it down that i'm going to do something now watch that at the end of the message because he says i'm going to do it he's not saying you're going to do it he said i'm going to do it i will sinned all right now in that doing then and satan not having a seed and eve not having a seed and in knowing that mary never produced an egg you know that would have been mankind bringing forth and it would not have been the seed of the woman because now if you'll get the point you'll see what i'm driving at the seat of the woman then would be the promise of god that's a promise amen all right we can lay our life on that i mean all right but it's saying that i'm going to sin this seed of the woman and it could not be that mary would bring the egg so that would be mankind doing it so it wouldn't be him saying it see you'd have to change genesis 3 15. you have to say you'd have to put it like this i i i will come down and i'll use that woman one of these days and because she was one that went wrong and i'll come down and i'll use her who said she's got to have something to do with it and she's going to produce the egg so you'd have to rewrite the bible right it doesn't say that it says i will but enmity so whatever is done it's the promise of god to you and i to bring forth he would do it well right now as i'm saying this morning then surely by what we know of foreknowledge that god knew we would fall and he knew what he'd do now if we get back to it over a few more messages i want to go through that old testament and just try to bring christ and see that and the right of the the christ to the old testament and then the ride of the the you know the seed of the serpent and remember when you're talking about the seed of the serpent then you you've got a uh you've got to get an understanding that some way it's got to be brought to a seed because the the seed of the woman right that was the last thing we read this morning see the seed of the woman was the the coming forth of jesus christ without the help of mankind you know all right but then we would discover the seed of the beast or serpent would be the coming forth by some form of human doings and wouldn't that be we then tie back to where that cain started it but he said now lord i've done this you know now you can take it or leave it and that's what the religious world is doing he's saying take it leave it no i forgot to welcome our little visitor this morning sister johnny's grand son is here and we forgot to say to him welcome this morning okay good to see you we always say welcome to you so you know that'd have him but we just blowed that in this morning and he got off all right but now and we're saying i watch the literal way we ended up on page 102 of the these in church age by saying that this would show the way the seed of the serpent would come into being but brother branham used the coming forth of the seed of the woman and he brought it forth in jesus christ you know mary and and the virgin birth all right so we're not looking for a virgin birth in the serpent seed we're looking for the wrong birth you know the messed up things all right and we know that's what we've all done and uh you know i know a lot of people don't want to believe that they're the seed of the serpent but now i'm just honest now whether you believe it or not that's up to you but i believe it's so intermingled you know and i can bring it down with brother branham i'll be glad to do it he brings it down one time and brings it straight to judas as to bring in judas coming down as the seed of the serpent i've got them laying on my desk because see i always run off everything try to study it and you you say well well you know i don't understand that i don't either because judas came from the same tribe jesus came from did you know that have you studied your bible judas came from the same tribe the tribe of judah so then you can't go physically see it gets all messed up and then to wind up with the lord jesus giving us a parable i mentioned this morning he's talking about the sore going forth or so and he said that was the children of the kingdom he said but the wicked one went forth to sow his seed so what do we got two seeds right god see the devil's seed then wouldn't it be as they're saying about the mark of the beast we all have the prophet said to mark of the beast unless we're born again well wouldn't it be that we were all as the prophet would say born between satan and ever now that's not degrading of anything that's just telling it like it is it's just being straight and honest to what we are we're all as the psalmist david said born in sin shave it in the nick would spouse my mother's womb went forth a liar we all need the new birth right we all need to be born again we need to get that straight it's not how good we are or what we do or how we go to church or what we do or give or anything it's all whether or not we're born again all right and see then that two seeds would come down why would jesus look at those pharisees that was raised in church not a marker against him and what'd he say he said you are of your father the devil now we ain't got to understand that you look at cain and say cain we love that wicked one that's right right that's kind of all right but look at religious people totally religious one mark against them they'd be killed and he said you're of your father the devil well now brother daley wasn't talking to them people he's talking to one in there that's okay how'd he get in there you know so that means we're all a.l.l all lost and need a savior all right now adam needed a savior just like eve come on he didn't just make coats for eve and send adam out naked okay he made coats for him too when it comes to the offering of the sacrifice abel was offering a sacrifice as well as cain was offering a sacrifice so abel was lost as well as cain but see why would people get into their mind to think that if we were born to some holy lineage we could be saved why would we consider even stuff like that i told you i wouldn't care if i knew that i was a direct descendant from the beast i'd glory in jesus christ because it don't have nothing to do with anything other than the new birth now but see the literal way that god was to come into the human race was by creation but satan couldn't do that so he used the the beast to achieve what he was trying to do and through an unlawful act we were reading out of oneness there eve brought forth all right but see he promised her a savior now get what i'm getting at see people wanted to say now you got to say this distracted and probably says you gotta say it well okay amen i'm trying to but i want you to say something all of us men got left out because only the women can be saved you believe i can prove that in the bible because it's her seed so we don't have one come on you see what i'm trying to say see we want to say this for example we'll say let's say brother branham said one day he said luther denominated and died and went to hell heart denominated and died let me correct that don't mate what the hell this brother said see i say what the prophet said i said you say it he said what do you mean i said well then if he denominated and died he missed it he caught what he's saying i said come on now you say it you just quote brother branham he wouldn't do it because he was caught and that's what we're doing we want to take the bible and the things and just what we want to say you know but i believe in putting it all together and it comes out to make a beautiful picture but what is the seed of the woman now you know the seed of the woman was called something else one time in the bible now i'm saying seed of the woman we know who the seed of the woman is it's christ right but you know it was called mary's seed that which is born of thee merry seat all right see we have to tie a lot of things together and where i want to start at brother brown said and given the scripture said when it comes over to genesis where eve said i've been appointed the seed appointed a seed it says in about the fifth or sixth chapter there i've had it somewhere in the notes but it said to rip in other words in place of say uh abel said whom came slew appointed why did it say appointed see the bible's right we just misinterpret the point of what it's talking about what did why did eve say appointed why didn't you what did she say he gave me a seed because when that what happened i mean didn't he give a seed in the place of of abel it was flu but eve didn't say that what she said he hath appointed me a seed because she just said he had given me a seed that would have been christ come on and she never according to brother branham eve never claimed that cain was her son she claimed abel she claimed seth she never claimed cain has to be in her son all right now he has appointed me a seed now we were reading this morning it doesn't say then he has pointed me an egg that wouldn't work but he has appointed me a seed didn't say he's given me seed that would have been christ and that definitely didn't happen back there she was appointed a seed in the facts of seth carrying on the human race because at that time the human race had stopped on the basis of that now adam and eve were having children so but there's no record but there was children born to them but the point i'm getting at she had to say it correctly she has he has appointed me a seed he has given me seth to replace abel all right seth was not to promise seed no more than isaac was the promised seed he was a promised natural seth was the promised natural to carry on to human rights all right but then if you can see it then you can see why she didn't say he'd give me more seed because that wouldn't work you know see she said he had to point it that means in place of to carry on the human race but it was not the christ that was brought forth there the christ was the promise to come that would be then called the seat of the woman now you mind we don't have much company today you might just preach a little bit without quoting so much you know reading so much we'll just try to do that a little see because when you come over to eve i mean mary for her to bring forth she had to have something to do with it on this basis she said be it unto me according to thy word but it's already a promise now that a virgin shall conceive so now you're following me what i've been on predestination and for knowledge and etc he knew mary would say that word right he knew she'd say it rightly but she had to say it he knew you would be a christian but you had to accept it right right so you can't overwrite a free moral agency amen see then when it would be brought forth mary would say be it unto me according to thy word she wouldn't say now because she didn't understand to say it she didn't say uh let me supply an egg right because that couldn't be involved right it's going to be involved for her to say be it unto me according to thy word well i thought the bride in the end time was supposed to say that you know all right so back there when the literal act took place the literal act between eve and the beast brought forth the seed of the beast you agree right but it wasn't called that because that had been called the seed of the beast so you know the whole world would have known what was going on the whole religious world would have known it so he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent but he said it exactly right what about god being able to say something right and us so misunderstand it he said the surface most subtle of all beasts he just went right on you know he didn't explain that right so eve and the beast brought the seed of the beast right but satan perverting her thinking into unbelief turned it from being called the seed of the beast to the seed of the serpent because satan was the one that was responsible because the animal right even though it would be taken and have to be sacrificed the animal didn't have anything to do with it it was just used but as we were ending up this morning talking about what that that was satan's way of trying to enter the human race now he knew he could not use that beast and enter the human race the way god could use mankind no follow me through and you'll get a good thought don't you know what happened on the day of pentecost god and man become one god came down in a man to give him the new birth satan can't do that so the closest thing he can do try as brother tony was saying good point he was trying his best to kill us what was satan's point in the beginning to kill us and you know i've always said and i believe it i've always said that i believe satan he literally believes that if he can get enough people on his side he's going to be able to whoop god somewhere you know i believe that i've always thought of that the point why would he want to do it but by killing us see he's trying to destroy the human race that god would live in right he doesn't want to destroy the the uh now he doesn't care about his death that's what it means it means death you see but which one did satan rather destroy and he'd rather destroy a slot drunk is that the other garbage can or had he'd rather try to destroy someone that was trying he's already got the other all right so then the seed of the serpent would bring nothing but death upon the human race it could not bring life god's the only one that can bring life his was the seed of unbelief and that seed of unbelief is what's killing you and me right now brother there ain't no unbelief in me well pray for me all i've got to say about it but now remember we spend a lot of time talking about the seed of the serpent when we really ought to be doing this it's trying to bring forth the the seed of the woman to understand it you got to cover the other to bring it forth see eve having no seed she couldn't bring forth the promise now watch what i'm saying she had an egg mary having no seed just an egg she couldn't bring forth right but god didn't come and energize or make alive the the egg that mary produced she couldn't do that i mean he couldn't do that and be mankind brought around said having part to do with it and see what i love in the bible is the way god does things you know they offered abraham a burial plot to bury his wife in and what's it mean if you birds your wife there you're gonna bury your family and different things you know man offered to give it to him a man had probably paid him to took it but he said no i'm going to buy it you realize if it had been given to him that would have been a type and then jesus christ would have messed up but see and satan when he offered him all of that he said okay i'll take it but not abraham said no i pay fart when it come down jesus christ said no satan i'm not going to take anything i'm going to pay for it and then you don't have no earmarks left on it to do anything with me and when it would come see then it would be the fulfilling of that i will put enmity if you're following what i'm saying then see if mary had anything to do with if he had anything to do with it it couldn't bring forth the i will well that's kind of what people wants today i think they want to alter the i i they don't want the eye to be him you know and that that won't work out but the prophet said he first appeared in genesis 3 15 according to the messiah e14 as the anointed one the christ that christ would come forth back there not how now listen one saying the reason i'm giving you that so you can go ahead and pull up number 10 if you want to or 11 excuse me pull up 11. the messiah my brother around and said the first appearing in genesis 3 15. we got it 61. from a seat of the woman which was to be the anointed one now the promise of the messiah we know when the messiah came right but what about a promise so great until god saw that promise me 4 000 years before it transpired to him it was already done and it would be called the anointed one then you can see that anointed one coming through the old testament to be able to tell god a better way of doing things the christ the prophet said he didn't wait 4 000 years to start bringing that promise to pius when he walked out of that garden as i was quoting this morning and he says listen i love you and i can't let you go like this i got the quotes laying on the desk or either back in the studio he said i'll come down and go out with you see if he'd stayed in the christ couldn't come you you get me if he stayed in the garden the christ couldn't come but by coming out with them there came the christ all right and that christ could come down through which was to be the anointed one all through the scriptures all the prophets spoke of that coming one the anointed king i like that word anointed god anointing one and he was to be a king who was to be israel to freedom and all like that but yet who is the anointed king who was the real king david wound up with to be the king anointed to do it but jesus christ is the king who was it in david it's christ all right see i've got to move from that because i want to get on that point see who is the messiah then who is the anointed one the christ the messiah to redeem according to marriage and divorce the messiah to redeem but he didn't wait 4 000 years to start coming into being he would be back there through the old testament as the atonement right of the animals but he would be there as the christ who took care of david who took who fought the battles of simpson and all of those great warriors the christ coming down but yet when you call it the seed of the woman well let me let brother brown say it go ahead with number 13 future home paragraph 3 20 through 23 or something you saw him and i'll put in between your seed and the serpent seed is it right and the woman don't have any seed did you ever think of that she has a field not a seed see the serpent had already placed his seed there then if the woman doesn't have a seed she has to remain to have a seat now don't stop that all the way back under i'll warn you that you might find out i'll use the same quote later on when we talk about the seed of the woman that come down all right you see through the sexual and of course there had brought from satan the serpent which was not a reptile in the legs because his legs went off of him he was the most subtle the only beast that would would do would co-ordinate with the woman a bc won't do it now once and nothing else they've tried it it won't work see the seed life out of the mail won't go into a female woman it won't do it know what he's saying you can't take the snake now and do it you know they've tried but the closest thing is what a chimpanzee and it won't work they've tried those things but now think about what i'm getting the point he would promise the seed of the woman and she brother brown says has to remain to have a seed which would be jesus christ right but she held on to that promise and that promise then of the seed of the woman would be called something else in the bible that would relate to this day it would come to revelations 3 14. to the lady you'll see an age and what does it say the beginning of the creation of god that's the revelation to this age so the seed of the woman would be the beginning of the creation of god all right i'm trying to get a point to you to see what this seed of the woman really is it was christ we know the promise of the messiah but when he got here he was called the seat of mary he said well no it's not in the bible how did he get here sure it was a virgin birth but yet mary said be it unto me that's what brought the promised son come on am i right was there mary to say be it unto me according to thy word all right and it would bring into being something that would seem odd it would bring into being the beginning of the creation of god now i don't want to spend a lot of time on that because that'll be wednesday the lord willing but the beginning of the creation of god brother ryan said where did god begin he said it began in the wound of a virgin that's where he began well because you're talking about creation when we get to it he was the only begotten but he's called the beginning of the creation of god and he's called the seed of the woman so then the seed of the woman has to be the beginning of the creation of god sensible a equals b b simon a all right but you see the beginning of the creation of god is god being born in human flesh you're not talking about back there in the beginning and the coming down and the you know the logos the theophany et cetera that we preached about all that's right but talking about the seed of the woman when she doesn't have a seat so what link can you put you see why i like it and when companies not too much but at least i can get down to saying something and the way i want to say it a lot of times you can't do it because of company and i don't mind company being around i enjoy preaching that way but see we covered a little bit this morning tapped it come on down this evening talking about it's called mary's seed i'll be glad to give you the quote for it brother random in illustrating mary's seed he's not talking about her giving an egg and god's supplying that right he's not talking about that he's talking about the immaculate or virgin birth that would bring him into being but he's talking about that she must say be it unto me according to that word so when she says that you know what it becomes her seed amen come on think with me when she said be it unto me according to thy word it became her seed it's mary's seed see it came right to her what was said in genesis 3 16 15. was fulfilled in her and she gave birth to the beginning of the creation of god now what does that beginning of the creation of god mean to you after all these years we preached about it it wasn't a time of god beginning the great eternal does have no beginning it was a time when he brought into being himself into flesh we've got a good one when we get over to it when we go back to john 1 14. he said and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us see the seed of the woman is called the word but you see it became mary's seed when she accepted it all right it couldn't happen in eve you couldn't accept it it couldn't happen down through there because it would not be the match-up or the scripture being fulfilled but the promised christ would come and not just be a christ in mary come on you agreed with me willian said that it takes a egg and a sperm to make a seed let's see if you can keep agreeing with it because see when mary said that in her wound become a physical seed that's right you agree yes amen a literal seed and that literal seed would be the seed of mary well because it was given them to her eve couldn't have it but she could have appointed until one would come right but if she said he'd give me seed christ would have come back there so it only appointed but when mary said be it unto me that word she said brought into being into her wound a literal seed and it would be the seed of the woman you say well how could that be because it was given to her may i quote a little this is my eye i come because god give it to me come on i'm in the message you need those quotes this is my hand god gave it to me see when he gave mary that seed it became her seed the seed of the woman came into being come on the promise of the coming messiah would have to have a place to be literal or it would be spiritual i've got to quote where brother brown said if it's spiritual you know is the seed of the serpent is spiritual right right you know if it's just spiritual oh it's just unbelievably spiritual well then jesus christ was spiritual right because the same thing it says about the seed of the serpent says about seed of christ oh god what is the seed of mary the seed of the woman god creating his own body to be able to fellowship with mankind but also to make a per a product that would wind up to be the body that god would have to remove himself and let die that's why it's called the seed of the woman because that's who it belongs to that's why then it would be called the beginning of the creation of god what it would be god creating again he wasn't through creating when he ended it with adam and eve that just ended the physical the prophet said creation you know human race here's one that's going to be borne that when he before he's born he's called the seed of the woman amen but when he steps forth out of that he's the beginning of the creation of god god in human flesh john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the seed of the woman the seed of the woman was what mary gave birth to so that didn't have anything to do with mary did it it was just fact it belonged to her but she gave birth to it i don't mind going ahead with it i'll preach it when i get back to it i thought we were supposed to give birth to the word in the end times i thought the prophet of god said it like this one time he said that he's the beginning of the creation of god he said we're the rest of that creation so the seed of the woman didn't stop back there in genesis it didn't stop in matthew as we call it we have to give birth to the word in this day but it won't be no rapture all right but see what is giving birth to the word you know what is it did we say we got to give birth to the word well i mean i've read it i've read it i've read it read it read it read it read it how do i give birth when that word and that spirit becomes one is the only way to give birth right it takes a word and spirit to be one word by itself is no good letter of the word it's just intellectual understanding but when god comes down and gives life to that word that we hold in there amen and when it does you know we're going to give birth to the seed of the woman if not right why is the 144 000 called the remnant of the woman's seed what your prophet called it they're the remnant you know the piece of material you lay out and you've got a pattern you go by that's the seed of the woman the remnant that's around is the same material right it's just not chosen for that so it's the remnant of the seed of the woman the seed of the woman is the dress you're making while i'm saying that some of your sisters are letting them slips get up a little bit in the back so work on it all right trying to be a little different about the way i preach just drop in there once in a while let it go but listen church i'm trying to get a point across why is it called the seat of the woman because that's exactly what it is it was mary seed that was given to her she gave birth this bride is giving a word to birth and to bring forth christ again the way he's supposed to be and he's the beginning of the creation of god and we're the rest of that creation i'll repeat these things but brother dale you seem to be making there's something have something to do with it did not the prophet cover it you want to read it where it says be it unto me according thy word he set a bride one day i think it's spoken words reasonable seed but he said one day the little bride will say be it unto me according to that word he said sparks will fly that's the way he says it he said sparks will fly why because it'll bring life if mary said be it unto me according to thy word brought jesus christ god in human flesh what was the birth of the word brain christ again no wonder there's going to be a rapture what could you do if you got christ back here like he was in the beginning you don't think he's going to be killed this time do you see he's going to be here visible the prophet said among us but he's not here physical that's another quote right so you got to get the two together he said we'll be back here in a corporate body he said we meet that now but he said he'd be visible among us and raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture well that's close to physical hallelujah it's very close but it's still not that because he can't be here physically what do you need to be here for he's got a body we are the people to give birth to the word right as mary said be it unto me that's what we're supposed to be saying lord get rid of my ideas and my thoughts get rid of me and my ideas and let me take what you're saying and believe your word he said because i will and i'm going to drill on that just a second then we'll get into the point i want to ask you this simple question i got wrote down here to lies when he said i will put enmity that means he's going to do it amen right when he said i will that means he's going to do it all right we spent 45 minutes talking about how he's going to do it but yet he's going to do it himself because the seat of the woman is not me and you no more than mary was the seat of the woman she gave birth to the seat of the woman come on mary wasn't the seed of the woman because it had to be in it would have been back there and even would have said he had given me seed and christ would have come to her no he said i will what is the promise of the messiah i will he just borrowed the wound right but you know by barring that wound that put her into an elevated position right come on very very elevated position that made the world testify that there was a virgin mary that received god's word and gave birth to god's word emmanuel god with us and it would mean a bride that would receive god's word in the end time and give birth to the word it's called the seed of the woman because it was given not because she could produce it mary couldn't produce a word she had to have a husband to get any kind of a child joseph couldn't get it by itself right well that's not even a child you're talking about that's where people that i don't even read you run your genealogy sometime i wish you would run your genealogy and you'll find out your genealogy comes to joseph boy that messes things up now you say what the bible says it comes to joseph it don't come to mary because women are not in the genealogies that's right in the listing joseph's journey wasn't the father of jesus but you're reading the bible it says joseph was his father right but you see we think we know so much the seed of the woman is exactly what it says a seed would be given and it would come by the woman why because she was a fall to start with her wound was polluted to start with right why did he have to come through the wound if it was apples you could lay him out on the table he'd come through an apple but see whatever god would bring to be the seed of the woman would have to come through the wound of the woman because it'd be given to her but yet in the beginning god never said anything about me and you he said i will i'll put enmity i'm gonna do it i'm coming out of the garden and going with you i love you so much i can't let you walk out i'll put enmity between the and the between the serpent seed and the woman's seed you'll have to wait four thousand years and when you do then i'll bring a virgin birth he said i'll place it into a wound of a woman if that don't prove serpent see not just like brother brown said on the on the future home he said if i don't show you the serpent seed he said you're blind why did you have to come through a wound god could create on a rock and bring a child right come on if he's going to create eggs firm okay come on let's see if you follow this he was going to create egg in the sperm why couldn't he put it in the monkey oh you're silly brother dale no just showing how silly we are see the seed of the woman then would be the seed given to her because she fell it wouldn't be given to him be given to her because she failed what did the prophet say he said the greatest honor could ever be he said a woman can be used in both one side or the other he said the worst thing in the world said she could be a type of but he said she could be a top of the greatest in the world he said now you're sisters he said i'm not talking about you he said not to genuine ones you know the genuines are going to give birth to the word then it'll be the word made flesh again amen the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ born in a woman that's where he created egg and spirit put it in the wound and just borrowed it but when it came forth it was her seed see without her it would not have been a human being well it's okay prove it okay melchizedek spoke into existence and spoke out of existence so was the two prophets that went down to sodom but melchizedek could not die for you and i never he would have to be our brother to be able to die for us melchizedek couldn't pray the price of sin even though it was a body spoken into existence and he walked out there and ate the calf and done the things and then he was spoke right back out of existence of god but you see we think that we have it all figured out now i didn't mean to tie into things of the bride being the seed of the woman but you tell me what it is the seed of the woman was jesus christ the bride is to give birth to jesus christ the word luther gave birth to the word of his day wesley gave birth to the word of his pentecost to them we've got to give birth to the end time word but instead of that we wind up arguing quoting we say well just say what the prophet said now don't answer don't raise your hand don't say nothing okay i used to be bad to make you pull you out and open you know and just say well and pull you out and open but i found out how embarrassing that gets sometimes and i decided not to do it at least today i won't i said i won't next time i want to ask you a simple question and you say well how does this tie with it well it'll you'll see was adam under a conditional covenant or an unconditional covenant right down on your face you don't have to tell me well brother dale adam was under an unconditional covenant i got his quotes well you know you're right adam was under you don't need that tree out there nothing's alright but you know that adam was under an unconditional covenant how in the world can you be under a conditional covenant and an unconditional covenant at the same time how can you and i as human mortals think about giving birth to the word that solve the problem he said well brother dale i got all these quotes for that adam was under a conditional covenant if you will you don't protect that tree and that's right and they took of the tree and they fell that's right but to the bride it will give birth to the word she will ponder what is being said and to see what it truly is to be the seed of the woman see what it means be it unto me according to that word now we're not trying to give a physical birth right so when the bride says be it unto me according to thy word it's not a meaning of physical it's the birth of the word right now how can you give birth to the word and you believe a trinity well brother dale i love the lord i just love the lord i just love the lord i'm amen i love the lord too i believe he's three what do you what do you think no no don't believe in that well i've got a rock and we ain't got no rights bible don't teach the trinity does it it teaches one true and living god and if i asked a question there's a reason i didn't see if i asked a question i'd say where was the first unconditional covenant come into being you'd say in abraham you that have studied the message you would quote me to death right there abraham unconditionally i wonder about a prophet saying that adam was on an unconditional covenant how about it you believe it wade mentioned it here the other day and i asked him i said do you realize what you're speaking of and do you really understand it go ahead and get number 14 and we'll get this and i'll quit this is god's covenant with abraham and his seed priest in 1956 223 paragraph for e11 now then when god saw the weakness of man that how he broke his covenant with him in the garden then you notice god making the covenant of the coming of christ he never included anyone in it are you reading a covenant with adam don't eat of that tree he was included in that covenant right god making the covenant of the coming of christ he never included anyone in it he said i and i is a personal pronoun i'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent's seed unconditionally do you see it anybody wait do you see it unconditionally god said i will in other words send a savior not now adam if you will do a certain thing out here why we'd have never had a savior because adam would have never done it but he said i will and when god says i will it's already done now so you see adam was on a conditional covenant but at the same time of being a conditional covenant he was under an unconditional covenant you see it no i don't see it okay pray about it i don't see how you can see under conditional and conditional same time you ain't looking at it right god listen god has never made a covenant with nobody on condition what he did with adam and him no he just told them he just told them you don't eat you're okay god's never made a covenant with nobody except unconditional i want to see it in the word and i want to see it in the prophet's message the way i'm trying to bring it out the coming of christ the promise of the messiah was not a condition he never said adam if you don't need that tree i praying to never said it that way are you with me yes did adam you done broke the covenant that i gave you or the commandment that i told you not to eat it right you've done done that but i'm going to keep my word i'm still going to bring the coming of christ because i said it to start with and i'll keep it i will put enmity there is no unconditional covenant in god god don't make conditions you see everybody you're not listening when he come to abraham he said no if adam failed noah failed all of us failed right but he said abraham i've already done it we think that's an unconditional cut that's right but he told adam he had already done it he told adam he put he would not destroy him he broke the laws of god mankind broke the laws of god we can't keep the laws of god but god never gave a law for us to keep we brother branham said accepted law instead of grace so it was never god's intention to give the law well because it made the promise i got to think that oh well think it over while you do it pray pray is a whole lot better than thinking adam was told don't you eat he ate god had already before it ever come into being if you've been listening to me the tree of life was in the garden if you'll go back you'll find out trees were created on the third day he didn't wait until adam failed and then bring the tree the promise was before the foundation of the world i thought because i thought that's what revelation 13 8 said that he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world but when he told adam he said him i adam i'll put enmity it was his promise he never stopped no more man's went on conditions we've made it conditions if you don't if you do like brother branham said as listen we was one day and he said it like this he said people say what must we do to be saved during the book of acts he said we tell them what to quit doing what not to do and what to do he said that wasn't the question they asked they asked how do we be saved can we give them a book of rules he says repent everyone and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost said we asked them what to do and said we tell them what not to do well do you believe in just living like the devil no i believe in being born again that they of the devil jesus never come to destroy the law he came to magnify it make it honorable the scripture says because he was the seat of the woman that's who he was wouldn't it that was mary's seat that was the beginning of the creation of god what's the rest of it supposed to be like where are you listening i'm just using that point get us to see how we can so miss anything and want to quote ourselves to death well now brother dale uh that quote dire was before the seals broke so we don't believe that quote well tear it out you remember what i told the brother when he told me that about the gifts one time he said they already let him be in the bibles they don't be tore out i said give me a bible we solve the problem we just rip it out is that being silly i don't think i was the one being silly i thought he was silly to say that some part of god's word is not right amen brother brown said something go dig in there and find out what he's talking about read that last quote over and over i just gave you he's talking about the unconditional covenant being that god said i will it don't matter if you break this you're going to break it anyway i know she was going to break it and i already had that tree sitting there before you ever sinned i had the tree and knowed what i was going to do when you did sin that i was going to come on the scene and i was going to do it he said i'm going to leave the garden with you adam because one day the seed of the woman will come it did it said in the last days there'll be a bride of jesus christ that will realize who they are who are we church if we're the rest of that creation as the prophet said we were then we must be the seed of the woman amen but that's just too far now brother dale you're going a little bit too far no i ain't went far enough because if we are the seed of the woman and we do put everything on the basis of having a new birth then we're god made manifest in a human form called a bride now is that far enough to go we're not the god of heaven come on you follow the teaching of the godhead that i've been with you when jesus was here on earth he said i do nothing until the father shows me who was that talking am oh just a flesh what we were talking about at lunch i was trying to get those brothers to see where david said the lord said unto my lord now brother random said he was talking in the spirit when he said it see the reason i don't believe that i'm a oneness is because i just can't run back there far enough to get oneness out of it because the further i go back i find more manifestations of god i told you ain't preached all i can see on the god head yet but i'm getting to it you see i don't have a bit of trouble with the father and me praying to him up in heaven but me saying that he's living right in here i don't do away with that that makes the lord that can talk to my lord why would you call him your advocate why don't you call him father no as an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous when we give birth since the gail to the word in the end time it won't be me and you it'll be christ the seed of the woman that's when i've tried my best to preach adoption to people and looking at it most everybody preaches here's the the father just going off the scene he's leaving and we're going to take over well one of these days i'll speak the word well i didn't know that was anywhere in the bible i thought the one that claimed to be god in human flesh said i do nothing until my father shows me that's what i thought i thought adoption with the father coming on the scene in the nature of the sun right until the father and the son is identical and that's not two gods or two persons and then when it's all over with we can still look up there and say the lord said unto my lord amen you still haven't caught on to what i use in genesis genesis 1 it says elohim lord capital no it don't say capital in genesis 1. it says god in a lower case which is the word genesis 2 when he created man it says lord god capital l o r d small case g o d read a little while longer and it says small case l o r d and a big case g o d then you go over to hebrews 1 and it says god g-o-d large letters he said oh that's just the start of a sentence oh man then go over to worst what is john 5 what is it is it 5 24 where it says god is a spirit it started to send us with god as a spirit it's a little case you see folks we're just getting enough to understand god while we're here in this world we're just getting enough to know a little bit about him it'll be an ever learning eternity about god in his ways you know the ones that are going to be there to understand it are going to be those that are the continuation of the creation of god that continuation of the creation of god started on day of pentecost it didn't start in this last days it started on the day of pentecost in the bride of jesus christ it climaxes with a group of people in the end time realizing who they are and knowing what we're here for we're here to strip satan of every power that he ever thought he had and yet we get sick and we start crying yeah oh lord stand up and face him that's right just face him and say satan get out of here you know what you're doing you're looking in the mirror because you know who you're talking to the guy that's looking at you in the mirror just say bye stripes i'm healed and then just keep walking go to doctor glory we do everything we can to help ourselves in that way but we don't depend upon the doctor right that's why i think you ought to be at church when you're sick i never i don't understand that now come on folks i'm human there are sicknesses you can't be at church right but when we got a toenail hurting yeah well my foot hurt i wanted to sit at home and hold it up that's what the doctor told me to do yeah you yield to your sicknesses you're just accepting it but if you fight it ask brother gary about what his daddy told they told him what was it was it was 80 or something of his patients that told him the first day in in in medical school said if you won't hinder your patients 80 of them get well right think about it church seed of the woman be in the seed of mary be in the seed of christ being the beginning of the creation of god being the seed of the bride in the end time the word the word right let's stand come on brother took a little bit longer i thought i'd be too short because i didn't have just a few notes but it's all right i hope you understand i don't try to be smart by giving illustrations but i just wanted to illustrate it that we think about oh it's just oh adam was under a conditional covenant and that's right he was but as far as god is concerned he was on an unconditional covenant because god had done said i will do it he didn't say adam if you halfway try he said i've done done it he didn't ask mine and you're okay to bring jesus christ into the world two thousand years ago did he well the biggest problem we've had we'd be a hendrix right oh no no that baby yeah we'd be a hindrance to his word let's get rid of ourselves and get on into it what we got boys okay let's go uh our little sister's been complaining with stomach problems and vomiting and things father in the name of jesus christ the one we spoke of this day we condemn this sickness not us but the spirit of the living god speaking through us saying by your scribes and we thank you in jesus name sinners because the seat of the woman is going to be there somebody's got to give birth why don't we believe let's give birth to our part let everybody else part of the word that we are to be we're supposed to be somebody ask yourself what are you not the bride of jesus christ what right have i got to say anything else anybody else before we go oh if you want to see a beautiful picture of the bride in the end time turn over to revelation 19. and read where he said his wife has made herself ready she rides back with him how many promises brother ray enter in the message that the prophet told us that we would be dismissed remember the services two you
