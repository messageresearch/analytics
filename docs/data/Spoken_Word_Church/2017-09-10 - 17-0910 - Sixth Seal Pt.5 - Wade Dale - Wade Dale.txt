========================================

okay well it's been running since I mean it was like days you know a sometime you know the state of Kentucky getting ready to file bankruptcy on their state pensions anyway this is that guy's weekend we come in - yeah what we're talking about now we're in it okay so let's go to revelation 11 and we're all ready to go revelations 11 and that was human meat less read revelation Steve's first let's get the gist of they'll seal and I'll be able to win it opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood you know they had that great big earthquake in Mexico yeah and a lot of stuff happened there some come here yeah it's coming this way the stars of heaven fell into the earth and even this fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains in the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks following us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand now I was thinking this morning freeing myself about the people they're human beings no doubt but they made a choice and I'm sorry I mean when we leave out of here this little thing is happening in Miami is they Tuesday compared to what people is gonna have to go through right mass destruction like I was talking to the brother of Minnesota thirds me not for money two hours we just need to get out of here we need to make sure we're ready preserve here we may go through some hey listen but a catastrophe for us there's no power for a couple of hours not for days and weeks and not at all right ever it yeah I never get any so so we are to a degree less my brother Brown said America would be hit the worst why because we are land of easy we're land Comfort I like my air conditioner lame I hear there's more to it we respond so sure a lot of death and murder yes the world America is responsible and we keep our own data and we turn to profit down so that's more that's the whole thing that's less cause instead of the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb so that will same loud that give you the Holy Ghost that's protecting you that's the level protection is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said he has to have wrath because where there's where there's mercy there's also judgment he is a righteous judge I've told you many times before huh what kind of a love of a God though that would that would love us enough to die for and then take us out of here and then whatever happens it's just kind of happened we we can't I'm going to say this and not really mean all of it we got taking motion out of it we've got to take emotion sure we have human emotions in there you got to go back to that you have human emotion but if we're chosen people and we're the bride of Jesus Christ and we're the ones that we've got to this point by the revelation that we receive then we can't say never would we say haha no Jesus never said haha he said Father forgive in other words but we've got a job to do and I was probably the brother meant soda we got a job to get the dead out the ground that's our job the reason this is happening is because the manifestation of the sons of God has not come to a full impact come I got that because this manifested son of God like what brother Branham was Jesus all the ones that said storm stop stand still who could stand down in four and go storm go out of existence utilize the most major storm what does that matter going that's not even a blip on his radar right so we'll see what he is giving us those in power he killing us but you know what power without character right that's our problem we call judgment on people what we should be asking for mercy and so power without character satanic but power with character spit the room you'll know what to do in any situation that you're in and to me that's what these seals are doing there they're cutting away all the junk all the big pieces that we need to get out of here because remember this is the nature cleansing what's happening now as nature cleansing the land he's washed destruction what man wasn't here Limpy if man wasn't in you know we didn't have CP five million people in Florida it just go up through Florida the Tasman trees down they just taking the girl right back up everything comes right back you look into look out in Montana where those 250,000 acres burnt up you said well that's horrible no it's the most lush green place there is now why because stuff burns gets the canopy off the stuff burns then what all that green grows up and the animals actually thrive better in that condition than they do with the canopy over that nothing can grow to take a knee so you see how nature is nature now we know that Nature has fallen but still nature is what Creek this whole world is run by about make natural things son cloud rain alright and what is rain do rain washes things away sure wit sister floods if your if your auntie but if you're not he just cleanses the land so a nature cleansing then we must come and see that a nature cleansing has to come to you and I first so what I said last time these signs follow the believer all these signs we're seeing has got to be a sign that a believer is coming to a place first first yeah not not thought loved one down well we got all this natural stuff happening so we need to get right maybe too late maybe too late remember the foolish virgin woke up with the wise virgin right they woke up at the same time and the first thing they did was is realized they didn't have any oil so where do they go they go to the bride they go to the ones with oil they know where it's at why because they are spiritual to a degree but there are not sons and daughters of God they are not born again believers right because something has stopped them from being that teachings of man teachings of message people teachings of whatever you want to say I'm gonna do a sermon today on something that we all know about but once I got to digging that man in English just be and that's water baptism we got we got five people being baptized today maybe four or five and we need to we say well baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ why kebobs it well let's see what you gonna do that we'll do this happening right then we'll have a great baptism so baptism is not a Salvation issue but you will do it you will do it alright you can be baptized after you get born again you can be baptized before it happened in the Bible right the time right so we'll see that this afternoon and then you got the thief on the cross it was never baptized but now he wasn't a born-again believer he was in the Old Testament paradise and we lifted out a pair of oxen put into a place of holding after Jesus came out of the grave all right I was waiting for him I'm only there for a day remember ATV that Saturday rose up with Jesus or died Friday night rode up the deep something all right so everybody didn't raise up as a human he rose up and theophany and went into a place of holding to waiting while waiting on who oh you don't say you or me wait no me they're waiting on us because look because like I said last Sunday we were born under a contrary nature we were born faithless absolutely we were homeless people we got no faith we didn't win when you didn't when you were out the world doing your thing and some of you if you weren't out the world doing your thing you still was growing up doing things you were in healing this we're not faith-based right now everything is faith-based right right show me show me Jesus Christ show me how you died on cross I don't know that I'm just written a book show me the Peter existed I don't know just written in the book I'm not a big trouble right we don't have a picture of any church agent messenger except brother Branham I mean sure we have drawings but no photographs on you draw any picture you want you see what I'm telling you about us in this endtime week we are a fake they had to end literally in the first church age they had to take what was being preached every Sunday and listen to what they were saying and make that manifest they did not have a book to go back to they did not have a quote they didn't have a tape they have a Bible the Bible would actually put together to the 50 hundreds yeah that's just a few years ago okay so what are we looking at we look we're looking at a nature cleansing that did to me this is the nature cleansing and honestly that's the hardest one cuz it's right there next to love me brother Claude was talking about a couple nine years ago why is it right here he said why not brother not know why was it right there that's the hardest thing be to love somebody even though you think they're good and you know what God knows if you really love them or not you don't have to you don't have to pretend God knows your heart okay but when you know your heart did you love that brother and you don't agree with it but you're still loving it's my brother Billy policy brother around them you could totally the enemy jurors transwarp he treated them all the same now we don't do that we don't do that people we ain't do that place yet we don't do that somebody cross you sure you'll love them and don't knowbut push them on good side call them servicing giving a free pink pillow game go through - hey Louie good to have you enough hey Manny corner the whole thing you did but like Jesus with Judith's Jesus column Judas in the garden friend now he didn't mean that he was lying Jesus don't lie but he called him friend right right he call him brother he called me friend but he knew from the beginning when he picked him and no one knew it but Jesus that's this whole situation he knew juices from betraying not the other eleven even at the time of his going and doing the betraying no one knew but Jesus and Judas he's only two people two new same way with you and I should think that's why stare brother Brown you couldn't tell who his friend or an enemy for why he treated them all saying exactly the same that's hard to know people I'm telling you it's hard to do cousin hard remain a bit but jesus said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and he was on the cross and they'd beat him for a day and a half almost didn't beat him up right and listen if he didn't mean that he was a lot of them always said the things that Jesus said we think sometimes seems contrary but if he said them he can't like so whatever he said was the truth from his heart not just a show like a lot of oh I love you brother you hear what he said in the name yeah but remember the property guy told us he said God is the segregation let's let God do the segregate let God do it we don't need to be saved guys let's let God do the segregate run let God you know back and forth can feel that God doing it what's happening that's what brother kind of brother kindness is coming in and take it over same way with this nature cleansing why are you and I thank you just handle them when they'll put everything why do you think that this is going to happen and then what's going to happen during that time it is because we're going to skip to the two prophets in Israel now and we'll get back to us in a little while but the only way that nature cleansing can happen is by the spoken word watch what happened right here these two prophets don't recall books to the youth right the Holy Ghost is speaking through them and they are manifesting the message for their time three two prophets and the Jews realized now I'm gonna talk about all Jews after 144,000 alright and it was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles that's outside world right because remember we couldn't go into the temple with you on the first court but we couldn't go in the other course for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months that's 1260 days we covered that in Daniel 7 new weeks running that's 1260 days at 30 days to a month that's how you get you clover and sixty day kind of the Bible's in it I like it when the Bible back to everything and I will give power unto my two witnesses what is power spoken word that's the most powerful thing because when Jesus had his temptation we with Satan not one miracle not one miracle did heed to him not one he didn't go to he said it is written saying it is written it is written all right and I will give power to my two witnesses which we know that for a fact it's the spirit of Moses and the liveness not what was it allowed to come back reincarnated we know that but it's the spirit of Moses and Elijah the fifth coming of Elijah and Moses that was who was on Mount Transfiguration so they move over and come down in the spirit of the two men are in two Jews not two Gentiles do you angle in here Gentile ji was going to here you are one of the people let me say that one of their people and I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore threescore three times two is six that's sixty 1260 days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees that goes back to Zerubbabel and all that zechariah and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth all right any any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devours their enemies now they're not gonna stand there with my flamethrower symbolism people symbolism revive receive divers mouth not go go and then you're gonna stay up statute it's the words of important in power in power these have a power five proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed hmm whatever you want to Bible say whatever you meet out that's what you gonna meet back they're gonna trying to kill the two witnesses and they're gonna die trying so don't you think after about well I'm just gonna be conservative 20 minutes 60 days after about 40 days or two months let's say 60 days after 60 days the Mossad the KGB the FBI the CIA they don't try to kill these two guys till they're ghosts they're setting them there's no way they in touch with know if you think they're gonna try to be assassinated sure they are and they won't be able to touch him man why because the Bible protects them the what the spoken word or an event spoke so it will protect them 1260 days what about you and I all these things coming we ask for God's protection for his bride and he's already put it in place to be would these have power mmm to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy now that's going back to Elijah in the Old Testament he said it won't rain for three and a half years not even do a fall on the ground well that was some laughter Penta have here that place was dry come over no do because usually like even in Georgia it didn't rain last year in June July and August but they will always do on the ground so something staying green but could you mad and he said you won't even fall that's a miracle in itself they rain not in the days of their prophecy so for that three and a half year period showing the mighty glad to say three and a half years he was setting a precedent that when he comes by that spirit comes off when he comes come to this person here there's you three and a half years one glyphosate three and a half years back any old estimate why because these speaking of prophesied that it will happen again sorry I've got a boom bend them in the throat they rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood no we know Moses did that with the plagues in Egypt right excuse me and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will so this is nothing happening now this is just a precursor to what's going to happen all right yeah I do I said thank you and when they shall have finished their testimony 1260 days they finished their testimony for 1260 days the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them that between them who we know the Beast is Rome because Rome is going to make a pact with them after we're gone since what my brother have said we had to get through the dam of 70 weeks and get it right before we moved into the seals because this sixth seal is exactly is exactly that time period of the Daniel 70 week the last week go remember he show at the covenant with many for one week on the feet he is Papa Rome he is the one that can master and then who is going back it up the United States are gonna back it up because we are the image for the beach all right if I got this a man done see so here it all fits together and for 1260 days which is three and a half years he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week once half of seven in the midst of that week he's gonna break that covenant right here because the Covenant is I'm gonna let you go in there and do sacrifices I'm going to give you my Nora because the Catholic Church holds the menorah we've already been through there we saw me how Titus went in and destroyed the city and took the menorah he took them the ark he took everything out of that temple Rome has it I said over there in Italy now and so what the Jews are gonna say instead look we want to start back to him for worship we got the red heifer you've heard the other day the brothers from that they were genetically modifying or read them for here in the United States they'll remember the red heifer have to be read and only three hours could be different color that's pretty rough one big animal this big but they say they're getting once they do they get that red heifer they say okay we've done everything can we have our stuff back don't you think here's will smarten up know that he's got their stuff they know Papa Rome has got their stuff all right and then he's gonna make a covenant with many for one week right according to Daniel 9 they're gonna say okay here's your stuff back those brother branham told us once we leave they will watch they will start temple worship again black oh they think the Messiah's coming right and there sir there's their lives of talking to them and they're gonna turn him down I always said all these people did think brother grounds coming back you know before the general resurrection my general before the ridge race another of the bride they're gonna treat him just like they treat that lives right there but this Elijah's gonna walk into there and say look this is not you're not to Temple worship finished let me tell you about Jesus Christ and you know what they're gonna hate him so if brother Branham comes back and only pizza or black glad to buy he suit no wrong Oh y'all wrong Stefan just a few they're gonna do what they want that I want to deal with Jesus he said every Scripture in the Old Testament and they turned him down this Elijah Moses are going to fit every scripture in the Bible and they'll turn them down and kill all right so in the midst of the weed question we covered their diets every week what's going to happen the Pope is gonna walk into that temple walk riding the Holy of Holies and say I'm the god you're looking for because when he breaks that covenant all hell's gonna break loose the Jews now remember the 144,000 they're going to be taken up the two witnesses are going to be killed and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was crucified so we know left Jerusalem and they have the people and Kindred's and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies CNN Fox News MSNBC whatever's left at that time are going to do just like they're doing now you can't turn on them you can't die on your phone without somebody in Key West Warner right showing the damage from the hurricane so what about these people that for three and a half years they are absolutely a sore in their side the whole world not just Israel the whole world is going to want these two people dead that's why I said all these all these assassins are going to come in try to kill them but they'll be able to until right here after that covenant broke then the Bible says after they come that's growth in whatever happens happens but the Covenant is for 1260 days for three and half years and that's why the native seventy weeks is so important to get it right not but to get right to get the dates right to get everything right because remember if there's only three and a half years left according to most people in the message then none of this other stuff can happen because remember the end of the 70th week starts the Jubilee starts 250g which is the millennium so they're missing the time period for the Battle of Armageddon bringing in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in a normal totally they got to build a temple nothing they got to build a temple and all those things during that time so we know there's one week left after the rapture now we know there's only 300 and 1260 days left for the message of Jesus Christ to be preached to the - it's not be two witnesses there is not seven years of tribulation there's only three okay because when you get the Battle of Armageddon from Armageddon forward it's not tribulation that's great tribute that's the ending of everything tribulation is you go through something and you come out of it this is not this is you starting battle Armageddon you go all the way through your dear dad and then only the bride 144,000 coming that's the way she is ghostly that's one guy that is deceived he's trying to hide behind his wife that's like hiding behind her we're not trying to hide an outliner but their dead bodies they're gonna be killed so lay on the street which is cost articles are true and they of the people and Kindred's and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days in the half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put into graves why because everybody's having a party and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry see that goes right back to the old Roman Empire when they would defeat people they have a party for all those parties and stuff with compliment where another wreaths and all that stuff and it would give gifts to each other that's what's gonna happen right here but see that thing they've defeated them so they're going to start this new world order again they're going to start this no it's the beginning of the Battle of Armageddon and after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet now listen three and a half days without I mean they gonna be the high it's going up they not gonna look very good after three and a half days but the spirit of life is going to enter into them they don't get a body chain and then they're gonna take that 144,000 ride up with them they stood up on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them now can you imagine having a 360-degree camera view of these two people laying in the street for three and a half days indeed everybody else's party and then all of a sudden the reporters about half asleep and he looks up and they're standing up great fear yeah I'm sure he probably died and that was good to be bit but they don't have to go through a battle Armageddon the great fear fell upon him which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them come Heather and they had centered up into heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them same hour there was a great earthquake tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnants were feared affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven the second woe is past behold the third woe cometh look and then we know what the third woe is that's third world war that's the Battle of Armageddon that's the third world war we think one world war wasn't the first woe in 1917 right saenko what was 1945 well forty forty-five second world war third world war is the third woe that's what's coming that's why I say to you if you don't get back 70 weeks right you can't place all this you can't place you over grounder what about your plate it all connects because if that Daniel 70 weeks ends when those two prophets are killed if it's the ending of the whole 70 week the millennium has to start right then but obvious it's not you got a battle of Armageddon now remember the Battle of Armageddon is going to be a battle of forces of man they all come to the Great Valley of the Miguel dominant staying in it's just a very big valley they said the blood will go up to the to the bridle of the horse because everybody's gonna congregate into that one place excuse me and they're gonna have a war and then all they're gonna do is they're just not stop pushing the buttons there's room Israel has to what has the sense and the fact SAP's and the fact is if I'm gonna die you going winning memory push to push through the pillars of the walls they have a thing called the Samson effect quick look at a point but if they start getting blown up they got enough armory to blow everybody outside so everybody don't start pushing buttons that's when the great battle poppy okay but we're not going to be you see it you're here to see it then that's why that's called the woe woe unto you and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever we'll stop up there let's go back to revelation 6 because they want you to see something that I think I think the Lord have been dealing with me a little bit by going back in and doing the singles upstairs so we may just do them upstairs too but you got to remember watch this there's always an aerial there's always they they pause between six and seven brother they'll appreciate it 40 years ago right cuz watch there's one two three four five six heels now you would think the Sabbath would open immediately but not you got revelation 7 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners holding the four winds of the earth what is winds war that when should not blow on the earth nor the sea I saw another angel ascending the east haven't still wouldn't go there's an interval something that's happening then you come over to Revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal so there's a narrable same way with the trumpets I'm not getting us a whole nother subject but when you go to the trumpets because right here you start with the trumpets you start with you go one two three four five six trumpets what but when I'm go read them all right then revelations ten one comes in that's not a trumpet that's an arrow right then there lations eleven but we were just talking is but okay where I just stopped eleven the seventh angel sounded of the great voice in heaven program said the seventh seal is the same as the seventh trumpet the Jews right there when the seventh seal opens on this earth to a group of people that right there it's exactly what's going to happen you come to the a thing the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ because remember nothing can happen until we leave so Christ in Revelations 10:1 came down so we know Christ is not somewhere else Christ is here to take us out of here and then all this other stuff can happen but the world is waiting on you and I property God centered adoption time we're talking 4x4 and that's what's gonna happen to you and I when you see what pray to us to us I want to say that to us not to agree we've had people try to preach the thunders as being seven people and link them in brother Brown said it has to compare with every scripture in the Bible every scripture in the Bible right so we'll get into that so now the sixth seal happens through two prophets it's a nature cleansing mmm because remember to have this natural nature cleansing there had to be a spiritual cleansing before and who is that because that one you know let's go to Romans 8 one of my second favorite speaker 3:17 and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us Paul's prophesying that was revealed in call but there's dispensations of dispensation is over now we're at the end time dispensation this is the last call of the pride for the earnest expectation of the creature our creation [Music] waited for it to get itself together no that's not one said I said I said I read where it says waiting for the other but we're going we're waiting for all this together we're waiting for all this to get so I say about these all these different things that's happening it's happening because somebody has become to a manifestation for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God this nature cleansing now goes right to here for the creature our creation was made subject of vanity not willingly because Adam sold us all out sold the human race own nature out none of this happened before Adam sold us out tornado whatever death so what was each fall Adam could have said no so we give it to a Eve Allah but Adam could have just said let's start over Lord but he couldn't because Eve was a part of him right literally not vigorously bigoted weak literally for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation now if you get that word up there original formation the thing literally building creation the act of establishing building the act of creating alright so the whole creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature our creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same then hope in other words by man because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth that's what happens in Florida right now why because what nature is doing now is naturally so naturally cleansing the earth it needs that spiritual cleansing firstly it needs that spiritual we will not need a natural cleansing in the new city mother nature's taking care of mother nature that's great mother nation state you know what Dyson I'm gonna keep this thing clean whether you do or not basically what he said yeah but he's waiting that whole creature that's one of the one I'm look since you wants to eat you instead of being friend goes he that's not his right condition that's not his right condition that it's not right that the animal eat the animal that he ten will get on the food chain it's not right so what if man is the highest one and we're right here and we failed and everything below us fail now what happened because of their description it when we may read a little bit so asleep when we know the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now remember the ground for each birthing the earth is burning what and not only they co-creation but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit [Music] even we ourselves groan within ourselves you think we're happy there that's happening in Florida we think that's happy that my dog gets run over on cyber Rover or one more no we're not happy about that if you're happy about that you need the new buyers all right and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves why because the nature inside of us is wrong we need a nature cleansing now Jesus is dead now he didn't compensate look at that and if the same one dwells in him dwells in you now usually Oh got that nature attacks to you because remember he was born not of carnal we were born of carnal so we have that worry Paul said that worrying and remember that war is between the old nature and the new nature Christ I did not have a war until Christ came into my soul when I say about that wasn't face I just live my life but never watch my brother Graham said like I said he said the same phrase do you have to go get your car because that's what I did when I went to born-again Christian I keep down that car go didn't take a thing about it so we use that same faith now for what healing and all the things we need get car cranking up getting a word say what God said getting word say what God said right I talked about water baptism this afternoon because there's promise attached to that not just get wet in the water right there's a promise to that that if you're baptized correct there's a promise and I believe we're brother Graham state dogs obligated to give you the Holy Ghost if you get baptized right if you mean it that's right if you mean it now a little talk about that this afternoon if you mean it you got well you know what he's gonna know he knows your heart he's the only person that knows exactly why are you going to that water if you going just because you win or John Winifred Wagner or our because if I don't get baptized they'll talk about me well if you get back if you get baptized if you get baptized and you start acting like them if you was a prostitute before and I'm saying all of us men included you were a prostitute because you are a prostitute until you're born again you prosecute yourself to the whole world drinking smoking gambling all your prostitute you sell yourself to the world right that's why you gotta get rid of that whole nature that's why they donate just gonna die and then we're baptized and showing of a good faith but now we come out of that water and still because I'm still a prostitute we just got wet we just got wet but now if you don't ever do it and God's dealing with you to do your pump look up that sacrament and God's dealing with you to do because remember Satan will never deal with you to be baptized right he will try every trick in the
