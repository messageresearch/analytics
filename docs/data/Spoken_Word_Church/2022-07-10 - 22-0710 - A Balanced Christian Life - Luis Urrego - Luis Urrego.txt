========================================

it has to be a balance in everything we see that god is a god of balance we see it in nature amen the the sun can't be too close to us or it'll just melt us away right it's got to be a certain distance there's a balance there right we see that the moon amen has a certain distance and it and it does its job and it does what it's supposed to do um because god put balance in there amen and um so we we we see that that balance is is very important in a christian's life because i one of the things that i noticed that when especially new christians or or or or people that are just starting to serve the lord you know um if you've come from a certain mindset or if you have a certain mindset um you're gonna lean through that mindset constantly and and and so depending on your situation and depending on the things that you see or that you're going through uh it might make you it might make you rocky it might make you unstable you see so you have to you have to see things in a balanced way you have to look at things in a balanced way in order for you to keep going amen because uh many times and we've seen it you know unbalanced christianity usually leads to problems usually leads to issues leads to issues with other people uh i'm right and you're wrong and that's it finally but see sometimes we don't stop and look and and think all right what is this brother talking about what is this sister talking about because we sometimes we're so used to just immediately flying off the handle if they say something that's not it's contrary to what to what the way i see things and to me that's not balanced christianity to me is you just you're just you're just reacting to to how things are and and that's not how we're supposed to act i mean jesus didn't act like that he had balance in the way he dealt with things when they came to him and we'll look at two examples of that here in just a moment but now god talks about in in in the bible uh in proverbs chapter 11 verse 1 a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just wait is his delight now we know he he we we there was in in the old testament there was a god hated false balances in other words when when you would go to the market and you'd give them you'd say i want certain amount of of this item and and they kind of don't put that certain amount in there but yet charge you the same price god hated that because that was a cheat that was that was cheating that was you lying that was you uh um uh treating your brother or or or uh in a false way you see or your sister in a false way so taking it into spiritual amen a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just wait is his delight all right so we see that god loves balance right amen god not just loves it he delights in it right praise the lord we can also see in you know in uh proverbs chapter 16 verse 11 adjust weight and balance are the lord's all the weights of the bag are his work all right now you taking it looking at it from the physical but also think and think of it in the spiritual as well and then job 31 6 tells us let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity amen even job desire to have balance and so the only way we can have balance saints in this in this life is the holy ghost yes the holy ghost is the one that gives us balance amen we come to this world and we pass through this world we become christians and we bring all the weight that we had a uh from from from the world bring it into into christianity and there we're trying to balance things out and sometimes we let the things of the world or those old views amen take the take the most of us one of the examples that you that you can give is for example if you grew up in the pentecostal church or if you grew up in in a church where there was more emotion and there was more uh you know jumping shouting screaming and all of that you coming to the message that's what you're going to do you see the message you saw that god sent a prophet just like the brother who came from the baptist church you both saw the same thing but in the emotion realm you receive the word in a separate in a different way one is more emotional than the other doesn't make one better than the other that's right therefore we shouldn't be judging one another amen we should be patient with one another well this brother doesn't jump and shout like i do he didn't grow up that way but it doesn't mean that he's not receiving the word like you are right you don't know i don't either well this brother jumps and shouts too much and screams and and and he just he he speaks too fast does he serve the same god that you do does he love the lord does he want to go to the same heaven that you do we all have the same goal we all have the same amen so amen try to keep a balance don't be critical keep balance balance christianity job even wanted balance let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know my integrity praise the lord amen all right as we as we mentioned here in just a moment uh just a moment ago we see that there's balance in nature everything has to work in balance it can't be too much of something it can be too little of something right that sun has to be a certain distance in order for things to grow right in order to make things uh do what they're supposed to do and there's just so much that we see that goes on on the earth and if god didn't put things in the exact place and and in the right proportions where it needed to be amen then things would be out of cater you see and it's the same thing in christianity things have to be in the right proportions you can't have too much of it or you can't have too little of it it's got to be in the right proportion in order for me to make this thing run right praise the lord amen we so we see balance in nature we see balance in our bodies man your bodies have to be they have to be a certain balance they have to have a certain temperature right i believe it's 98.66 degrees something like that right it's just a ruse if if you get out of that temperature just a a degree right a a degree less or a degree more amen there's going to be health problems in your in your body just one degree it gets out of balance right when you get off one word a man or when you come in with a critical spirit one criticism coming to the church it takes the whole thing off cater it takes the whole thing off balance it takes your life off balance right and it makes everybody else amen get off balance because you know who wants to be around a critical spirit i don't first corinthians 10 13 tells us there hath no temptation i mean even there's balance in our trials that's what i just want to try to say look look what look what jesus said or what peter uh paul said there hath no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it even in your own trials and in your old temptations and in your own surprise problems that god allows there's a balance to it god has a balance he won't give you more than what you can handle and he won't give you less than you can handle right it gives you just exactly what he knows that you can handle oh lord i can't do it i can't you're going through it that means god is allowed that specially catered that trial just for you because you're going through it that's how much god loves you and he cares about balancing your life amen praise the lord so there's balance even in our trials there's balance right praise the lord so what is balance what is balance and and and these are the definitions of the word balance and even distribution of weight enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady all right so there's there is is an even distribution of weight so that something can stay upright right you know this bottle right here there's an even distribution of weight uh uh you know so they can stand upright right it was it was made in a way where the weight where it can the weight can be held evenly so if let's say if sometimes we get these bottles and they're shrunken up too much you know maybe the sun's shrunken up and you stand them up and they're like this that it lost balance there's balance that's been lost it's been affected by the elements and the trials or the problems that it has or maybe the way it grew up the way he grew up and he thinks he's right or she's right she's off balance like the tower of pisa in italy that we're about to look at here in just a moment and you walk you walk your life you think you're the one that's right and you're the one that's off balance and you don't even know it see somebody who somebody who thinks that they're who doesn't think that they're wrong uh you know a liar doesn't think he's a liar a cheater doesn't think he's a cheater a a person who constantly uh uh uh you know backbiting or or talking about people doesn't think that he's a gossiper or she's a gossiper they don't but you see it takes the word of god to show you those things and if the word of god shows you amen where you're at then it'll help you put your life back in balance right now you're the one who has to accept it take that word and say lord i'm off cater a little bit let me get back in balance that goes from the pulpit all the way to the janitor's room we all need to get back in balance it's also a condition in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportions amen also keep or put something in a steady position so that it does not fall okay yeah so if i put this right there look it's about to fall all right put it back here too much right here it's about to fall and if i put it right here in the middle it stays right it stays in balance and then brother branham always talked about the middle of the road staying in the middle of the road why did he say that because that keeps you in balance that keeps you steady when you're riding on the in on the road and let's say it's wet or or it's been raining usually it's the sides that's usually very wet and a lot of you know it makes you unstable but when you stay in the middle of the road that water is running towards the east side like this and when you stay in the middle of the road it keeps you better stable you see so it keeps you in more balance and better balance why is it important to have balance in our christian walk i want to ask you that why do you think it's important to to to have balance sister you will um ever imagine in your life how desperate you are to make everything right and have that balance until something like this until something rocks it yeah amen that's a very and it's a very good reason too because usually it's not until we experience something that we don't understand where we really are you see and so very important so so balance balance keeps you focused now let's let's let's look at a man on a tight bro brother wade has been talking about the that man i forget his name what was his name melinda wallander wallenda well linda he was a type walker and we have many tightrope walkers all around the world who practice this now in looking at a tightrope walker they have to stay balanced the whole way in order to get to the other side right so you have to stay focused so balance keeps you keeps you focused right it also keeps you thinking first instead of reacting all right think first instead of reacting brother so-and-so said something to me oh i'm gonna just say something back to no that might not be the way to handle the situation all right stay balanced what does the word say helps you to think about the next step is he a tight roll walker he has to think about the next step he takes it one step at a time and what is our christianity is one day at a time one step at a time amen one service at a time take it one step at a time and also balance keeps you moving forward right it keeps you looking ahead it keeps you looking looking looking at the mark it keeps you moving forward praise the lord so that's how typewrite walker gets across he's not looking all around the situations and the problems and that and that man pointing at him and and and and and clapping and things like that no he's looking ahead he's staying focused he's staying thinking about his next step not what everybody else is saying around him not what everybody else thinks about him amen he keeps looking ahead keeps thinking forward amen praise the lord james 1 8 tells us a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways amen one that flies off the handle and reacts amen when you tell him something you come up and then he just says something right back to you some snappy and something smart that's on stability that's instability praise the lord and many of us need to practice on that we we're so we're so quick to just fly off the just say whatever comes to our head amen but it doesn't help us and it makes sometimes it just makes things worse now what is balancing balance uh in balancing tires brother donnie you might know this right balancing uh when when you feel when you feel like the uh that you're there's too much vibration in in in when you're riding and then maybe you might need a tire balance your car may need a tire balance and there's a whole process they use weights and things in order to balance tires well even a vehicle needs to have the tires in order for the thing to run and in order for the thing to get to where it needs to go it needs to have a balance as well the tires need to have balance so if balance your spiritual tires when you perceive that there's too much vibration how do you do that balance it with the weights of the word amen looking in the word that's how you get balanced now i want to look at the statue of a perfect man here for just a moment but uh because even even in in in in food in in the in the things that we eat there has to be a balance as well right and the government gave us a supposed uh food pyramid we know that that doesn't that doesn't work many of us now don't don't work but just to give you an example this is what people's food pyramid is close enough [Laughter] hey i mean in a pizza slice i'm eating meat i'm eating bread i'm eating uh dairy and uh you know whatever else is in the pizza that's close enough but really in reality that that eating so many so much bread and grains and all that stuff that's why people are the way they are they look the way they are they eat too many too much bread so really that thing doesn't work but in looking and looking at that looking at the statue of a perfect man even adding to your faith right that's all these virtues that are working in our lives they're working in balance right right you have to you have to you god wants god wants us to have these virtues in our life in balance now there come there will come needs and situations in our life where we may have to work a bit more godliness than them patience at that moment or a little bit more temperance than and then than to use knowledge at that moment but all these virtues they're working in us amen in a balanced way you see why because they are holy ghost virtues and the holy ghost is not an unbalanced person he's a he's a he's a person of balance right and it all starts with faith and uh and and so in ii peter i can read the whole thing here but it says in besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and the bound right god wants these things to abound in us they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things you see that here's one in verse 8 that that peter is saying these things need to be abound but when they're lacking there's no balance right they need to they need there needs to be a balance but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see a far off right like that type walker he can't concentrate he can't he don't know what his next step is right when these virtues are not working in the in the christians life and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and in ephesians 4 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ and brother wade's been speaking about this too we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ amen watch that that we henceforth be not more children tossed to and fro carried about with whatever wind of doctrine or whatever is thrown at us or whatever sister so-and-so tells me whatever brother so-and-so says or thinks about me we don't get tossed to and fro about that amen we stay focused and we stay concentrated all right here's a here's a here's an example of a weak foundation this is the tower of pisa in italy the foundation was made of limestone and lime mortar however it was dug only three meters deep and built on dense clay which was not a very stable place to build a 14 500 ton tower the weight started to compact the solar until it found the weakest point and it started sinking in on one side and so the foundation was the way it was founded or the way it was the foundation wasn't right so when you have an unstable foundation when you have an unbalanced foundation which if it's outside of the word of god it's an unbalanced foundation any viewpoint that you have or anything that you bring from your old life or from your old denomination it's unbalanced if it's not part of the word of god and when it and when your life starts getting rocky and starts and starts tilting to the side people will see it people when they go see this tower of pisa they see that it's leaning and they've tried to fix this thing uh uh all and they and they were able to get it back straight a little bit but they can't do it fully because it was built on an unstable foundation right now you take the you take the pyramids for example the foundation of the pyramids were laid with limestone blocks mined by mason using copper chisels contrary to popular belief the egyptians built the giza pyramids up from the bedrock of the plateau not over a flat sandy base khufu is one of the pyramids in fact was built around a small rock knoll so these pyramids have been there longer than the tara pisa and yet they're still standing and they're not leaning right they may be crumbling maybe to the side the elements rain and all that stuff but hey they're still standing firm right and what is what is our life supposed to be in the holy ghost supposed to be a firm foundation stature of a perfect man it's got to start with faith right faith in jesus christ who is the rock right faith in the word and that's what will help you keep keep you grounded and i'm just going fast now matthew therefore uh well jesus here talking about uh you know building your house upon a rock and then satan brings all these things to make you unstable unsure lost and clear puzzle confused baffled that's what that's what satan he he he he's good but now here's two examples about of jesus when when in john uh in luke 9 uh says and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us and jesus said do you see the instability of of john and jesus says to him and jesus said until forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us amen you see somebody jumping shouting and screaming and and and and being happy in the lord don't don't you maybe you don't understand that you don't need to criticize it you see a brother or sister that's just too quiet you know they don't they don't say amen you don't know if they're saying amen in their heart don't criticize him stay bound also jesus being asked if tribute should be given to caesar or not he gave a balanced answer he said give to caesar with caesars and give to god what's god's that keeps you balanced amen praise the lord jesus so we'll leave you that was those two examples and when i have the musicians come balance christianity balance christianity we got to be balanced in our lives and because that will keep us moving forward it will keep us have healthy relationships with one another right and it'll keep us growing in the grace and the knowledge and the faith of our lord and savior jesus christ god bless you all thank you for your thank you
