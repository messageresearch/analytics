[22:55] matthew 7
[22:57] 7-8 says ask and it shall be given you
[22:59] seek and ye shall it shall be given you
[23:03] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[23:04] shall be opened unto you for everyone
[23:06] that asketh receiveth and he that
[23:09] seeketh findeth and to him that
[23:11] knocketh it shall be opened
[23:15] so
[23:16] now this is this is a
[23:18] looking james is speaking here in james
[23:21] chapter 4. it's a little bit
[23:23] a little bit different here but james
[23:26] says
[23:27] he says from whence come wars and
[23:30] fightings amongst you
[23:32] come they not hence even of your lusts
[23:34] that war in your members you lust and
[23:36] have not ye heal and desire to have and
[23:39] cannot obtain you fight more yet you
[23:41] have not because you ask not you ask and
[23:44] receive not because you ask amiss
[23:47] and ye may that you may consume it upon
[23:50] your lust ye adulterers and adulteresses
[23:53] know ye not that the friendship of the
[23:55] world is enmity with god whosoever
[23:57] therefore will be a friend of the world
[23:59] is the enmity of god is the enemy of god
[24:03] do ye think that the scripture saith in
[24:05] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us
[24:07] loveth to envy
[24:09] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[24:11] saith god resisteth the proud but giveth
[24:13] grace unto the humble submit yourselves
[24:16] therefore to god resist the devil and he
[24:18] will flee from you draw an eye to god
[24:20] and he will draw nigh to you cleanse
[24:22] your hands he centers and purify your
[24:24] hearts you double-minded amen god bless
[24:27] you tonight you have your seats
[24:30] and
[24:32] this is uh
[24:34] this is from the message
[24:36] and thy seed
[24:38] shall possess the gates
[24:40] of his enemies
[24:43] the brotherhood says now imagine when a
[24:45] trial come up
[24:47] what's the first thing a child of god
[24:49] has for refuge when a trial comes he
[24:51] says the greatest weapon was ever put in
[24:54] the hands of mankind prayer
[24:58] it even changes everything it even
[24:59] changed the mind of god one time god
[25:01] told his prophets go up and tell the
[25:03] king
[25:04] he was going to die and the king turned
[25:06] his face to the wall and said lord i
[25:07] beseech you
[25:08] to consider me i have walked before you
[25:10] with a perfect heart i need 15 years
[25:12] longer and god spared his life 15 years
[25:15] longer prayer changes things that's
[25:18] right
[25:18] and he says no doubt when these three
[25:21] hebrew children come to a prayer meeting
[25:23] that night
[25:24] what are we going to do
[25:27] there had to be a gathering and decision
[25:29] to be made no doubt they prayed all
[25:32] night long and the decision was
[25:33] unanimously because they were going they
[25:36] were deciding that they could not afford
[25:38] to go back on god in the time of trial
[25:41] he said wouldn't that be good for the
[25:42] whole church now when the decision is
[25:44] made shall i turn to the things of the
[25:46] world shall i go like the rest of them
[25:49] go that decision comes to every
[25:51] christian it comes to you daily
[25:54] how are you going to do it you've got to
[25:56] make your decision
[25:58] amen
[25:59] so i want to
[26:00] look here asking and believing and
[26:03] receiving and one of the first things i
[26:05] want to look at is the word ask
[26:08] and here's some definitions for the word
[26:09] ask it says to put a question to to
[26:12] inquire of and that's usually what we
[26:14] think of
[26:15] when when we talk about asking is we
[26:17] always talk about it being in the form
[26:19] of a question
[26:20] to inquire but it says to say something
[26:23] in order to obtain an answer or more
[26:25] information or request something to do
[26:28] or
[26:29] give something
[26:32] so here when we when we talk about see
[26:36] say something
[26:37] and one of the things i was when i was
[26:39] looking at some of these things what
[26:41] come to my mind is you know we have they
[26:43] have a uh program now
[26:45] in the united states and it says if you
[26:47] see something say something
[26:49] if you see something out of place or
[26:50] whatever you see something suspicious
[26:52] you're supposed to say something
[26:54] and
[26:55] i i was looking at some things and
[26:56] that's what caught my attention was you
[26:58] know if you see something then you ought
[27:01] to say something also if you see
[27:03] something in the word of god then you
[27:05] ought to say something because it should
[27:07] elicit a response from you because if if
[27:10] something catches your attention because
[27:12] you know then you have to say what
[27:14] what it is to you because you should
[27:16] amen that
[27:18] it should it shouldn't have you know
[27:19] nobody has should have to pull an amen
[27:22] out of you or glory to god or hallelujah
[27:24] or something that caused you to raise
[27:25] your hands it should always be something
[27:27] inside of you that's just bubbling up
[27:29] that somebody just say something and you
[27:31] say that's nothing but the truth it
[27:33] requires a response boy because there's
[27:35] something down on the inside because if
[27:38] it's if it's a fountain that's bubbling
[27:40] up then it's got to have a release
[27:42] somewhere it's going to come out
[27:43] somewhere and you know i was thinking
[27:45] about what brother brother wade's
[27:47] talking about now is the time that he
[27:48] talks about you know now is the time and
[27:50] the day in which we live it's time to
[27:53] let it out
[27:54] whatever is on the inside it needs to
[27:56] come out it needs to it needs to be
[27:57] exposed it needs to be manifest because
[28:00] if it's on the inside then it's time to
[28:02] let it out
[28:04] now many times you know what we
[28:06] talk about the word ask and we always
[28:08] talk about you know when we're little
[28:10] and we're teaching little kids you know
[28:12] to ask nicely
[28:14] you know and maybe make sure you use the
[28:16] right words you know don't say can you
[28:18] say may i do something
[28:20] because you don't say can because that's
[28:22] that's wrong because that's asking if
[28:23] somebody has the ability to do something
[28:26] but you're asking for permission
[28:28] but you know one of the things that that
[28:30] when we look here in the scripture you
[28:32] know when when you're asking of
[28:33] something of god you know
[28:36] god doesn't always want us to question
[28:39] or ask it in the form of a question you
[28:41] know because it's not asking but to
[28:44] understand who you are
[28:47] and what what is yours
[28:49] then when you go to claim
[28:52] or you have a need then it's not
[28:54] something where we have to sit and even
[28:56] though brother branham said you know god
[28:58] doesn't have to beg us but he said if
[29:00] there's any begging needs to be done we
[29:01] need to do it but it doesn't necessarily
[29:03] mean that we have to beg god to get
[29:05] something from it
[29:07] now here in the message the restoration
[29:09] of the broad tree brother branham says
[29:11] he said now if satan has robbed you of
[29:14] the privilege of being a son or daughter
[29:16] of god we have a right this morning by
[29:18] the holy ghost to enforce the claim of
[29:20] god bring them back if he's afflicted
[29:23] you and made you sick we have a right
[29:25] before god to enforce the laws of god by
[29:27] stripes we are healed amen bring it back
[29:30] turn him loose you're taking him out
[29:33] here under death and we claim him bring
[29:35] him back now
[29:37] that's the enforcement restore it back
[29:39] to its natural condition again a man is
[29:42] sick a baby is sick a woman is 6c
[29:44] they're not out they're out of their
[29:46] natural condition then we have a right
[29:49] to enforce our claim not our claim
[29:52] it's our claim because god gave it to us
[29:55] by stripes we were healed he was wounded
[29:57] for our transgressions with his stripes
[29:59] we were healed now we have a right to
[30:01] enforce that law
[30:03] and the lawgiver the holy spirit himself
[30:06] is here the agent of god to see that
[30:08] it's done that way amen
[30:11] now when when uh one of the things i was
[30:14] looking at when when here brother
[30:15] branham and he's speaking of this and
[30:17] he's speaking of having an enforcement
[30:20] and having a claim now when you go to a
[30:22] court of law and you make a claim
[30:25] and you file a lawsuit and you go before
[30:27] the court to make a claim you know you
[30:29] don't have to go before the court
[30:31] and and you don't have to ask can i do
[30:35] something because when you go before the
[30:37] court
[30:38] when you go into court the thing that
[30:40] you have to do is when you file your
[30:42] legal documents or whatever the first
[30:45] thing you have to do is you have to
[30:47] apply the law so you have to know what
[30:49] the law says and then when you walk in
[30:51] there then because if you say well this
[30:54] is my property and this is my deed to
[30:56] this property this belongs to me i have
[30:59] the sales receiver and all the different
[31:01] prop the paperwork for this shows that
[31:03] it's mine now when i walk into court and
[31:05] say no this is the law this is the right
[31:08] court for this is the judge that i'm
[31:10] supposed to be standing before here's my
[31:12] documents this shows that this belongs
[31:15] to me now what i want to do under the
[31:17] law certain law certain subsection
[31:20] whatever it says that i can do this
[31:23] this person right here that is on my
[31:25] property or has taken my property his
[31:27] brother bannon breeds here and i'm going
[31:29] to kick him out or i want my property
[31:31] back now this is the law and this is
[31:33] what it says now i don't have to go in
[31:35] there and ask the judge for that all i
[31:37] have to do is bring it before the judge
[31:38] and telling this is what the law says
[31:41] this is who i am so i'm in good standing
[31:43] in the proper standing to make this
[31:45] claim and this is my this is my
[31:48] documents and then all i have to do is
[31:50] apply all the other evidence and facts
[31:52] that are needed for the case and i
[31:54] present that before the judge and then
[31:56] then the case has to present go forward
[31:59] and where the judge can have to hear the
[32:01] from the other side and make his
[32:02] judgment i don't have to go in there and
[32:05] ask questions you know question and
[32:07] plead well all i got to do is go in and
[32:09] make my po so when the word says that i
[32:12] make my petitions known
[32:14] before god it's not that i have to go in
[32:16] there and plead and beg all i have to do
[32:18] is walk in and tell him i'm a son of god
[32:21] and this is my claims and i'm gonna
[32:22] exercise my rights and here i stand so
[32:25] when i come boldly before the throne of
[32:27] grace to make known my petitions i don't
[32:30] have to stand there and wonder if god's
[32:32] going to hear me or not
[32:35] i don't have to plead and beg all i got
[32:37] to do is stand up and claim my god-given
[32:40] rights
[32:41] as brother brown said claim your
[32:42] god-given rights
[32:44] so when i stand up there now all i have
[32:46] to do when i walk into a court is make
[32:48] my petitions known and show who i am and
[32:50] what i want amen
[33:00] so here
[33:04] i will read the i just want to read a
[33:06] few scriptures here this is matthew
[33:08] chapter six beginning at verse eight
[33:11] it's number three
[33:13] he says
[33:14] he says be not therefore like unto them
[33:17] when he's speaking
[33:19] of the pharisees and such he said for
[33:21] your father knoweth what things you had
[33:23] need of before you asked them
[33:26] he said after this manner therefore pray
[33:28] ye our father which art in heaven
[33:30] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[33:32] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[33:34] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[33:36] and forgive us our sin
[33:38] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[33:40] lead us not in temptation but deliver us
[33:42] from evil for thine is the kingdom the
[33:44] power and the glory forever amen
[33:47] now i read that for one thing is he this
[33:49] this is why
[33:50] jesus told the disciples he said under
[33:53] this matter this way you should pray
[33:55] and you know because he was talking
[33:56] about you know the the pharisees and
[33:58] such you know the scribes and all that
[34:00] you know they they want to make these
[34:01] long prayers and he thought well you
[34:03] know the longer they make their prayers
[34:04] and and these great flowing words and
[34:06] everything like and they think they're
[34:07] going to be heard because of what they
[34:08] say and god knows what you have need of
[34:10] before you say anything
[34:12] it doesn't no no that makes it makes you
[34:14] god want to listen to you
[34:16] but it's it's a it's a broken and a
[34:18] contrite heart it's somebody that's open
[34:20] and and bear before god and honest
[34:22] before god is who he's going to listen
[34:23] to so that's the way you present your
[34:25] case but one of the things i i want to
[34:27] read some of these because you know one
[34:29] of the things
[34:29] i read that you know there's never a
[34:31] question in any of that
[34:35] he didn't question any of that
[34:40] oh please god
[34:42] can you do this for me may i have this
[34:46] no jesus said give us this day our daily
[34:49] bread amen
[34:51] so when you go into just like when you
[34:53] went into a court of law you're not
[34:54] asking
[34:56] you're making your petition known so how
[34:59] do you do that you know what your
[35:00] position is and you know what you want
[35:02] and you make that known
[35:03] amen
[35:05] amen
[35:09] here's here's jesus also praying
[35:11] matthew in matthew 26 when he's in the
[35:13] garden and he's and he's praying
[35:17] before he goes to calvary and he says
[35:19] and and he says and he went a little
[35:21] further and fell on his face and prayed
[35:22] saying oh my father if it if it be
[35:25] possible let this cup pass from me
[35:27] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[35:30] wilt
[35:31] and then in verse 42 says and he went it
[35:33] went away again the second time and
[35:35] prayed saying o my father if this cup
[35:37] may not pass away from me except i drink
[35:40] it thou will be done
[35:43] so when he's speaking then he's not he's
[35:44] not
[35:45] questioning it but he's just making his
[35:47] petition known
[35:49] and then mark 11 23 and 24 says for
[35:52] verily i say unto you that what
[35:55] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[35:58] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[36:00] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[36:03] but shall believe that those things
[36:05] which he saith shall come to pass he
[36:07] shall have whatsoever he saith
[36:10] therefore i say unto you what so what
[36:12] things soever ye desire when you pray
[36:14] believe that you receive them and you
[36:16] shall have them
[36:18] so we don't so right back we're not
[36:20] we're not asking for something we're
[36:22] making our petition known
[36:24] so we're claiming what's ours and
[36:26] speaking to god amen
[36:29] now one of the things that that
[36:31] i wanted to say was you know i love that
[36:33] story that brother dale's told so many
[36:34] times about that man said you know he
[36:36] said i don't ask the god for anything
[36:37] anymore he said i'm working on
[36:39] commanding the lord
[36:42] because the bible says command ye me
[36:46] and pop said he just turned around and
[36:47] walked off because he knew he was
[36:48] talking to
[36:51] i mean what kind what kind of ridiculous
[36:53] thing but you know it's not because you
[36:55] you don't go in
[36:57] arrogant
[36:59] and you're not gonna you're not gonna
[37:00] force god into something
[37:03] but you know what god wants you to bring
[37:05] his word to him
[37:08] when you bring israel because what does
[37:09] he want to hear
[37:11] when you when you when he says confess
[37:14] when he says confess what what brother
[37:16] rhymes say he said it's to say the same
[37:18] thing
[37:19] so when you're confessing you're saying
[37:20] the same thing it's not that well lord
[37:22] can i have this
[37:24] no you said
[37:27] that i could have these things
[37:30] you know uh when i was when i was
[37:32] preaching to the brothers in india
[37:37] i use my i use my favorite quote
[37:41] and and you know i've read it many times
[37:44] and y'all may y'all may know it but i
[37:45] love it just it just first time i read
[37:48] it just thrilled my soul and you know
[37:49] brother in the message why he talks
[37:51] about that little sister that had that
[37:53] was poverty-stricken you know she just
[37:56] had all those those little pretty
[37:58] pictures that her son had sent her and
[38:00] she was about ready to starve to death
[38:01] and had nothing but somebody come by and
[38:04] was checking on her and asked her about
[38:06] you know you had a son yeah and you know
[38:08] he's got money and and all this type
[38:10] thing and it's like well you know it
[38:12] seemed like he'd be want to take care of
[38:13] his mother so well he probably don't
[38:15] know what kind of kind of condition i
[38:17] i'm in but you know went through all of
[38:19] those things and they said but i get all
[38:21] these pretty pictures from him
[38:23] and you know the man was in india and
[38:26] and he had all these pretty pictures
[38:27] that he had sent his mom and she just
[38:29] stuffed them in her bible and she was
[38:31] just laying there holding on to all
[38:32] those things and and then somebody come
[38:34] by and and they took those things and
[38:36] and said well let's see those pretty
[38:38] pictures so she went and got her bible
[38:39] and she opened up her bible and she
[38:41] began to look at and pull those pretty
[38:43] pictures out and somebody began to look
[38:45] at them and realize you know what they
[38:46] just want pretty pictures but they were
[38:48] bank drafts that had come from india
[38:50] that had been converted from indian
[38:52] money into american money and brother
[38:55] brown said what was it he said in the
[38:56] lids of her bible she had everything he
[38:59] she thought it was just pretty pictures
[39:01] but come to find out it had real value
[39:03] to her and brother brown says and
[39:05] brother when somebody tries to take you
[39:07] of a painted fire of pentecost that
[39:09] jesus is not the same as he was back
[39:11] then he said don't believe that he said
[39:13] because the promise is unto you and to
[39:16] your children and to them that's a far
[39:17] off even as many as the lord our god
[39:19] shall call he said he said that's a bank
[39:21] draft on heaven so when the money is
[39:24] already there he said all you got to do
[39:26] is make that claim is write that check
[39:28] on the bank draft of heaven and see if
[39:30] he won't fulfill it so when you're
[39:32] making the claim it's not that we're
[39:34] asking god that we have to ask god for
[39:36] something no god wants you he said ask
[39:39] that your joy might be full so when
[39:41] we're asking we're not asking if we can
[39:43] have something while we're just going to
[39:45] claim what's ours why because he's
[39:47] already given to
[39:48] if he's standing here today brother ram
[39:50] said if he was standing here tonight in
[39:52] clothes standing in front of us he
[39:54] couldn't do more for you than he's
[39:55] already done he said lord jesus could
[39:58] you heal me no i've already healed you
[40:00] the problem is is you've got to make the
[40:02] claim and you've got to walk into the
[40:04] claim and make that make that claim and
[40:05] stand and hold on to it so it's your
[40:08] claim have you made that petition known
[40:10] before god not wondering if god's going
[40:12] to do it no you make it known and put it
[40:14] in god's in god's life put it in god's
[40:17] hands and you know what then he'll take
[40:18] care of it
[40:19] but the problem is is we wonder if you
[40:21] know it's like as brother brown was
[40:23] talking about somebody stole their
[40:24] property and you know and the lawman
[40:27] comes to take him to jail and you're
[40:28] holding on to well i don't know if i
[40:30] should let him go
[40:31] no yes man you know i don't know
[40:34] he said you know what you're not ever
[40:35] going to get anywhere doing that
[40:37] he said you've got to turn him over to
[40:39] god and the devil take your property or
[40:41] take whatever from you then you let the
[40:43] you let the holy spirit take him and
[40:45] take him and pull him away and let him
[40:47] handle the situation then you can get
[40:50] what you have need of but if you've got
[40:52] your hands and you want to meddle in it
[40:54] and try to hold on to it and you're just
[40:56] being a being a hindrance to yourself
[40:59] but you've got to let god have it and
[41:01] handle it turn it over to him so then he
[41:03] can do what needs to be done
[41:10] see all these things
[41:13] are placed in the scripture for us
[41:16] james chapter
[41:17] james chapter 1.
[41:20] verse 5 and 6 says if any any of you
[41:22] lack wisdom let him ask of god that
[41:24] giveth to all men liberally and not
[41:27] upright of not and it shall be given him
[41:31] but let him ask in faith nothing weight
[41:33] nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
[41:36] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[41:38] wind and tossed
[41:40] so you can't you've got to turn it over
[41:42] to god and hold on
[41:44] by faith
[41:46] nothing wavering why because if he said
[41:48] it then you know what i'm just going to
[41:49] turn over to you lord because that's
[41:51] what you said and i'm just going to let
[41:52] you handle it because that's all i can
[41:54] do i can't let i can't do anything else
[41:57] you're the one that's in charge and
[41:58] you're the one that's made to make the
[42:00] petition known so i'm just going to let
[42:02] you handle it
[42:06] first john 5
[42:08] verse
[42:09] 14 and 15 says and this is the
[42:11] confidence that we have in him that if
[42:13] we ask
[42:14] anything according to his will he
[42:17] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[42:20] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[42:22] have the petitions that we desired of
[42:26] him
[42:27] so if we ask in confidence because we
[42:29] know where we're standing and if we know
[42:31] what the will of god is because we know
[42:33] that the will of god is his word so if
[42:35] we know what the word says then if we
[42:36] just take the word right here and we
[42:38] begin to read in the scripture and we
[42:40] realize that the word is this is ours
[42:43] and then whatever he says in the word
[42:45] belongs to us and there's no there's no
[42:48] qualms there's there's no wavering
[42:50] god don't waver on what he said god's
[42:52] not an indian giver he's not confused on
[42:55] what he said now sometimes we get
[42:57] confused on what he said but you know
[42:59] he's never been confused on it and the
[43:01] thing is is if he's ever done it brother
[43:03] i said if he's ever done it one time for
[43:05] any one person that if you make the same
[43:07] conditions that person meant then he's
[43:09] got to do the same thing why because
[43:11] he's he's honor bound by his word to
[43:14] fulfill it and you know what he wants
[43:16] that's his desire is for us to take him
[43:19] at his word and hold on and believe what
[43:21] he's saying
[43:22] and if he can just get people to
[43:23] actually believe what he said and walk
[43:25] in it and believe what he said that's
[43:27] all that was that's the greatest thing
[43:30] if
[43:31] that god wants us to have somebody that
[43:33] will actually take him and believe what
[43:35] he said
[43:42] now this is from the message
[43:45] and i read all that
[43:47] and you know there's no
[43:49] there's no questions
[43:51] no questions but just saying what you
[43:53] want
[43:57] now to believe and confess
[44:00] what the word says
[44:02] and this this is from the message look
[44:03] away to jesus
[44:06] and brother branham's and brother
[44:08] branham is at sister hattie wright's
[44:10] house and he and he's speaking and he
[44:12] says look look i said it is only
[44:15] the only thing is he is jehovah jireh
[44:18] just when abraham needed a realm god
[44:19] provided that rim and he provided the
[44:21] squirrels he can
[44:23] speak a squirrel
[44:24] just into existence because he is a
[44:26] creator creator just the same as he
[44:28] could speak the realm abraham never
[44:30] asked for it he was just simply going on
[44:34] to do it but he showed that jehovah
[44:36] jireh was there
[44:38] so he didn't ask for it why because he
[44:40] was fulfilling what god told abraham to
[44:43] do
[44:44] he god told abraham he said take your
[44:47] son and go offer him on the mountain
[44:51] but you know what abraham didn't waver
[44:54] he didn't get confused he didn't he
[44:55] didn't have any problems with what he
[44:58] said he took him and when he when the
[45:00] servants were there he said
[45:01] me and the lad are going yondered to
[45:03] worship but we'll come back
[45:07] because he had a confession he had had
[45:10] faith to what god was going to do
[45:13] he didn't know how god was going to work
[45:14] it out but he knew what god would do
[45:16] because he was the promised son
[45:19] because brother madam said in the
[45:20] message patriarch abraham he said he got
[45:23] god gave abraham a double test he made
[45:25] him wait 25 years and go through all of
[45:28] the journey that he had to to come to
[45:30] the place where he could actually
[45:31] receive a son and then the son was born
[45:34] and then he turned right around and told
[45:35] him to offer him as a sacrifice
[45:39] you know many times people people have
[45:41] to you know they get so
[45:44] troubled sometimes because they go
[45:46] through things and you know they they
[45:47] struggle with things and they have to go
[45:49] through a hard time and and it struggled
[45:51] and all this and just on and on and on
[45:53] and it seems like they got victory and
[45:55] as soon as they get through the victory
[45:56] then they got another battle and it's
[45:58] worse than the first one or they're more
[46:00] confused why why god why are we going
[46:02] through this i mean we just come out of
[46:03] this and now we're going through the
[46:05] same thing and not realizing if you're
[46:07] if you're the faith seed of abraham you
[46:09] know what then you go through one trial
[46:10] guess what god's made you and he showed
[46:12] you you can come through that one so
[46:14] when you enter into the next one then
[46:15] you don't have to complain why because
[46:17] if he brought you through the first one
[46:19] then he's giving you the grace to come
[46:21] through the second one instead of saying
[46:23] thank god i've got the victory then i'm
[46:25] just going to continue to walk in it
[46:26] instead of complaining and trying to
[46:28] look and have the wowzy wowzy woos and
[46:30] the molly grubs and everything else but
[46:32] to realize you've got victory he's
[46:34] already given you the victory
[46:40] see he brought us through
[46:42] see if he was he was jehovah jireh that
[46:44] he that he brought us through
[46:47] he said i said that a humble little
[46:49] woman the first time this ever happened
[46:51] the third pull
[46:52] being upon a human a human being was a
[46:54] little humble woman
[46:57] and he was talking about you know she
[46:58] only made
[46:59] like two hundred dollars a year another
[47:01] just strolling up bro
[47:03] but you know he talks about all this and
[47:05] you know he wanted to give her money
[47:06] back and he says and little had he said
[47:08] the right word
[47:10] said that's nothing but the truth
[47:12] and there she she said that brother
[47:14] banks wouldn't hear is one that was
[47:17] present that room filled
[47:19] like it was coming apart
[47:21] and the holy spirit said the same voice
[47:23] that spoke about those squirrels said
[47:25] give her what she asked for
[47:27] and i said sister hattie as a witness
[47:30] before god this is it now if there is
[47:32] any doubt in your mind you ask what you
[47:34] want to
[47:36] and if it ain't laid on in your lap then
[47:38] i'm a false prophet she said brother
[47:40] branham everyone was crying said what
[47:42] shall i ask for
[47:44] and then she began to talk about well
[47:45] you know you're poor and all these
[47:46] things like that but scrolling up says
[47:48] but whatever you asked for sister had he
[47:51] see now if it happens or not right now
[47:54] see if it
[47:54] happens or not right now
[47:57] and i said he just told me the same
[47:59] voice said give her what she asked for
[48:02] and she looked around and said what
[48:04] shall i say brother branham
[48:06] i said say
[48:08] didn't i didn't say i said say what you
[48:10] desire what your desire is think of your
[48:13] greatest desire and say it
[48:16] and her voice was even snickering and
[48:18] laughing and she said the greatest
[48:19] desire that i have is the salvation of
[48:21] my two sons i said i give them to you in
[48:24] the name of jesus christ and there they
[48:26] went and they have been faithful in this
[48:27] church with communion them little boys
[48:29] sitting there watching feet with the men
[48:30] and things like that and we are witness
[48:32] to that she had a real choice her mother
[48:36] has to die so does she all of them but
[48:38] what she asks will be eternal and the
[48:41] salvation of her children that is the
[48:44] third time it happened so when she began
[48:47] to say when they asked her what was what
[48:49] was
[48:49] the you know what shall i say brother
[48:52] branham what shall i ask for
[48:54] he didn't say that she had to ask he
[48:56] said say what you want make your
[48:59] petition don't say
[49:01] because you're standing there because
[49:02] you said the right word
[49:04] and you know what struck me was
[49:08] i was sitting on i was sitting on the
[49:09] roof and i was thinking about you know
[49:11] but what sister hattie wright said put
[49:14] her in the right condition
[49:16] and it left her in a position for her to
[49:19] say whatever she wanted to
[49:21] and i was sitting on the roof and i and
[49:23] i and i thought that and i and i
[49:24] repeated it back to myself and it's like
[49:26] man we play that left right game there's
[49:28] a there's a red light right left thing
[49:30] because you know what because sister
[49:32] hattie wright said the right thing and
[49:33] it left her standing in the position to
[49:35] say the right word because she had the
[49:37] right thing to say
[49:42] that confused some of you but you know
[49:43] what i had to laugh on when i said it on
[49:45] the roof and i said you know what i'm
[49:46] going to have to say that in church
[49:47] because that
[49:48] i just love that but you know what it
[49:50] puts you in the right condition
[49:52] by saying the right thing it leaves you
[49:54] in the right place to say what you have
[49:56] need of
[49:58] and many times people's like well you
[50:00] know it's just like being trying to get
[50:02] say well you know i'll come to church or
[50:04] i'll come to god when i get good enough
[50:06] you know what you're never going to get
[50:07] good enough to come to god all you got
[50:09] to do is follow the word and come to god
[50:11] and he takes care of the rest and lots
[50:13] of times people think about all the
[50:15] things all the sins that we've committed
[50:16] all these things you've got to get
[50:18] beyond all that and put that under the
[50:20] blood because he's faithful and just to
[50:22] forgive you and cleanse you from all
[50:24] unrighteousness then make your petitions
[50:26] known but if you let the devil play in
[50:28] your mind then you'll wonder about all
[50:30] these things that you've done you can't
[50:32] stand there and hold the promises of god
[50:34] and worry let the devil play in your
[50:36] mind you can't have let the devil have
[50:38] any place in any of this you've got to
[50:40] stand there and say devil you're done
[50:43] you're finished get behind me because i
[50:46] because i claim the blood i have stood
[50:48] i'm righteous before god that i have the
[50:50] right to stand boldly before the throne
[50:52] of grace and make my petitions known
[50:55] i can claim what he said why because he
[50:57] gave it to me
[51:00] the desire that god has is for us to
[51:02] claim what belongs to us
[51:10] but many times people want to
[51:12] hold on to the wrong things
[51:14] we want to
[51:15] people people have their desires so
[51:17] messed up that they get they get so
[51:19] bound down by things that are false and
[51:22] and wrong
[51:26] that's the reason i was i was reading
[51:27] here in james where it talks about you
[51:29] know all these fightings and wars and
[51:31] things
[51:34] when when here's james speaking to the
[51:36] to the believers
[51:39] you know when you get all wrapped up and
[51:40] things
[51:41] why because there's things in this world
[51:43] that people people want
[51:45] you know because we're human we like
[51:47] nice things we like comfort
[51:51] i mean and it's not wrong to have those
[51:53] things
[51:55] but the problem is that sometimes people
[51:57] desire to have have the things of the
[51:59] world
[52:01] then they have more have more desire the
[52:03] things of the world than they do of the
[52:04] things of god
[52:08] and he says
[52:09] he said ye ask and you receive not
[52:14] he said he said ye he said you lust and
[52:16] you have not you killed and you desire
[52:18] to have and you cannot obtain you fight
[52:20] in war
[52:21] yet you have have not because you ask
[52:23] not
[52:24] why because people people are out they
[52:26] get up early in the morning and they're
[52:28] struggling and striving trying to get
[52:30] something but you know what they never
[52:31] ask god for anything
[52:34] they get out people do things and they
[52:36] the last person they ask is god
[52:40] they never bring anything before god to
[52:41] find out what needs to be done what
[52:43] god's will is or anything like that
[52:45] they're spinning their wheels and they
[52:46] wonder why things never get to the place
[52:48] where they want them to get to why
[52:49] things don't ever change
[52:51] why things don't get any better and it's
[52:53] like why because you've not asked
[52:56] and he said he said you asked and
[52:58] received not he said because you ask
[53:00] amiss that you may consume it upon your
[53:03] own lust
[53:04] so when you're asking for something
[53:06] brother if you look up the word i miss
[53:08] it means something that's improper so
[53:10] you're asking for something that's
[53:11] improper that you may feel your own
[53:12] desires
[53:14] and not the desires of god what would
[53:16] what would you have me to do
[53:18] what is that your desire for me to do no
[53:21] it's i'm chasing my own dreams i'm
[53:23] chasing my own things and you know many
[53:25] times we have a lot of young people and
[53:27] they they start to wonder about what
[53:28] they're going to do in the future and
[53:30] all these things like that and it's like
[53:31] well just seek the lord
[53:34] just seek the kingdom of god and his
[53:36] righteousness and all these other things
[53:38] will be added unto you but you've got to
[53:40] seek god first if you put god first in
[53:42] everything that you do you never go
[53:44] wrong
[53:45] but the problem is we get we get messed
[53:47] up on things because we get out of step
[53:51] now one of the one of the the
[53:53] definitions of of
[53:55] the word of mist is when you start to
[53:57] look at the word of mist and when you it
[53:58] means improper it means wrong
[54:02] one of the one of the words for that is
[54:04] sick
[54:07] when jesus speaking to the pharisees and
[54:09] and they're asking why are you eating
[54:11] with the sinners and the publicans he
[54:12] says a physician is not needed by the
[54:14] well people it's by the ones that are
[54:16] sick it's the same word a miss is the
[54:18] same word it means sick it also means
[54:21] diseased
[54:23] it also mean anything anything that's
[54:26] out of place out of out of order
[54:30] so you know when you think about all
[54:32] these things when you're asking for
[54:34] something and then when you when you
[54:35] start to get something and things don't
[54:38] go the correct way then you wonder why
[54:39] because you've asked the wrong way
[54:42] because you're following the wrong way
[54:46] now when when brother branham was
[54:47] speaking here in the message the inner
[54:48] veil
[54:50] he was speaking of of the children of
[54:53] israel and he says notice this how god
[54:55] sets in the church this is number 10
[54:58] brothers he said now notice is how god
[54:59] sits in the church and what he does
[55:02] you're eating the same manna
[55:04] now
[55:06] he said now here was one wall of
[55:09] justification one man can come to christ
[55:11] and
[55:12] no man can come to christ unless the
[55:14] holy spirit calls him and the holy
[55:16] spirit is god and you know it no man can
[55:19] it's the same holy ghost and these
[55:21] people out here in the in the justified
[55:24] state a fellow trying to serve god out
[55:26] here in the courts was eating the same
[55:28] kind of manna
[55:29] they were that was on the inside of the
[55:31] holiest of holies but the thing it was
[55:34] it ran out
[55:36] it got contaminated he said they were
[55:39] all saying there's wiggle tails in it
[55:42] and the problem is what is what he say
[55:44] he said you must go out every morning
[55:47] when the when the manna fell he said
[55:48] they had to go out and pick up their
[55:50] portion every morning
[55:52] but they couldn't hold any of that over
[55:55] except on the on the the sixth day for
[55:58] the seventh day because they had to hold
[56:00] get that double portion because they
[56:02] wouldn't fall on the on the sabbath they
[56:04] had to get that double portion but
[56:06] anytime anybody tried to hold over any
[56:08] of that manna that failed they go well i
[56:11] don't have to go out and do this
[56:12] tomorrow because i'm gonna hold this
[56:14] over well the next thing you know they
[56:15] had a big disease rotten mess on their
[56:18] hands because it was full of wiggle
[56:19] tails and then and when the children of
[56:22] israel done that then moses got mad at
[56:24] him and told him so why did you do these
[56:26] things knowing this contrary to the word
[56:28] it's contrary to what god told you
[56:31] he said he got contaminated says all
[56:35] they all say it had wiggle tails and he
[56:36] said that's what's the matter with a lot
[56:38] of people's experience tonight it's got
[56:40] wiggle tails in it rotten maggots it's
[56:43] because you permitted it there you are
[56:46] living out here eating the same manna
[56:50] now the man could eat here he was
[56:53] he was eat all right but he got he got
[56:55] hungry real quick that's the way with
[56:57] the people saying i can
[56:59] i just can't hardly
[57:01] hold
[57:02] yeah
[57:03] you're not far enough
[57:06] right
[57:07] you'll come to that holy place watch
[57:09] aaron the high priest when once a year
[57:11] anointed went in behind the curtains and
[57:13] when the with them curtains dropped
[57:15] behind him the world was shut off
[57:19] so what is it because the the same
[57:22] brother said the matter was a type of
[57:24] the holy ghost it's the same holy ghost
[57:27] all the way through that's leading you
[57:29] brethren said also types the message so
[57:32] it's the same word that's coming all the
[57:34] way through that's leading you in the
[57:35] beginning it's the same word that you're
[57:37] feeding on the problem is is people
[57:39] don't follow the same way because you've
[57:41] got to continue until you get into the
[57:43] holy of holies but so when you when
[57:45] you're in the outer court or in the
[57:47] inner court that's good but you got to
[57:49] continue on till you enter into the
[57:51] holies of holies because the problem is
[57:53] is all of that on the outside yeah it
[57:55] run out there was they had to continue
[57:58] to go back but he said the thing is when
[58:00] you went behind the holy of holies that
[58:02] group that owner of of mana that was
[58:05] collected was put back there in that
[58:07] area behind where the holy of holies
[58:09] when it said back there you know what it
[58:11] never got old it never got stale and
[58:14] every time each priest when they had the
[58:16] opportunity to go back there when they
[58:18] came into the priesthood then they were
[58:19] offered the opportunity to come into
[58:22] that same place and taste that same
[58:24] manna that nobody else knew anything
[58:27] about but they could come into there and
[58:29] they could eat of that same manner that
[58:30] fell in the wilderness that was showing
[58:32] that god that god kept his promise
[58:37] you know it's you know they call it the
[58:39] the
[58:41] the ark of the testimony
[58:43] well why was it called the ark of the
[58:45] testimony because it was a testimony of
[58:48] god to the people showing that he was
[58:50] true to them he fulfilled his promise
[58:52] but they never kept their end of the
[58:54] bargain they never kept their word to
[58:56] him
[58:57] because each one of the times that you
[58:59] see why was it because when they when
[59:01] they went up there when moses went into
[59:04] the mountain and he went on the end of
[59:05] the mountain and god gave him that was
[59:06] giving him the ten commandments and god
[59:08] was communing with him for the 40 days
[59:10] what were the what were the children of
[59:11] israel doing they were down there
[59:13] committing idolatry
[59:16] and what was it when moses came down he
[59:18] break up the stones on the golden calf
[59:21] destroying that why because it was a
[59:23] testimony to them because god had went
[59:26] in there to bring the law down to them
[59:28] and they're out there committing
[59:29] adultery
[59:30] committing idolatry
[59:33] spiritual fornication because they were
[59:35] out there just i just well you know what
[59:37] aaron we want you to raise up another
[59:39] god to us because this moses ain't
[59:41] coming back we ain't seen him in forever
[59:47] but that's not what god said god was
[59:49] still god and god kept his word to him
[59:51] and then he told moses later on after he
[59:53] rebuked the people and he ground up the
[59:56] gold and he made him drink the water and
[59:58] then he went back up into the mountain
[59:59] and god told him said come back up here
[1:00:01] and i'll give you the law
[1:00:03] the tablets that you broke and he
[1:00:04] brought them back down
[1:00:06] to the people and he showed them the
[1:00:08] tablets said this is a rebuke to you
[1:00:10] because you know what if you hadn't been
[1:00:12] in idolatry if you hadn't got away from
[1:00:14] god and his word then you know what we
[1:00:16] wouldn't had this problem because we
[1:00:18] would have had the original ones
[1:00:20] so here they come bringing the second
[1:00:21] ones in because it was a rebuke to them
[1:00:23] because they didn't follow the word
[1:00:26] and then they went here they are
[1:00:27] murmuring and complaining against moses
[1:00:29] and aaron because he didn't like they
[1:00:31] didn't like the way that god chose them
[1:00:33] well i don't think god really chose you
[1:00:35] i don't think you're really called of
[1:00:36] god
[1:00:39] then what did he do he took one he took
[1:00:40] each one of the tribes and wrote their
[1:00:42] name on they told him you take a man you
[1:00:44] take a stick you write their name on
[1:00:46] each stick and you put it in in the holy
[1:00:48] play in the holy of holies
[1:00:51] and see which one god
[1:00:52] vindicated why because it butted and
[1:00:55] brought forth the almonds why because it
[1:00:56] was a proof to the people who god had
[1:00:59] chosen
[1:01:02] you know what that wasn't something that
[1:01:04] moses done that wasn't something that
[1:01:05] aaron did that was something that god
[1:01:07] done for
[1:01:08] them and here they are when they go out
[1:01:11] and god brings them out into the
[1:01:12] wilderness and leading them
[1:01:15] and and told them we're going to the
[1:01:16] land of milk and honey and every time
[1:01:18] they had a need when they were short of
[1:01:20] water he always gave them water but he
[1:01:22] told them all the way in this journey
[1:01:24] you're going to have food that you're
[1:01:26] going to eat that's going to give you
[1:01:27] the strength and then you're going to be
[1:01:29] well and you won't have any problems all
[1:01:31] the way through this journey and all
[1:01:33] they were walking and going and every
[1:01:35] time they had a need every time they had
[1:01:37] a battle whatever would come their way
[1:01:40] god was there to answer the need and
[1:01:42] meet their need and all they could do
[1:01:43] was murmur and complain about what god
[1:01:46] had done and they stood there and said
[1:01:47] we blow this light bread moses we're so
[1:01:51] tired of this get us something else
[1:01:54] go to god we want something else because
[1:01:56] we're tired of what comes from heaven
[1:02:00] so what'd he do he took a whole homer of
[1:02:02] that and put in there as a testament but
[1:02:05] because each one of those things spoke
[1:02:07] against the children of israel why
[1:02:08] because god does exactly what he was
[1:02:10] going to do and what he would do for
[1:02:12] them and they rebuked and
[1:02:15] done away with it
[1:02:18] murmured and complained against what god
[1:02:19] had done for him
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:22] you know what no wonder that god didn't
[1:02:25] told him
[1:02:26] don't come up on this mountain
[1:02:30] you know
[1:02:31] he wanted he wanted to have fellowship
[1:02:33] with him he wanted he wanted to speak to
[1:02:35] each one of them
[1:02:37] but they didn't want it
[1:02:40] that's right
[1:02:45] and many times god wants to speak to
[1:02:47] different ones and he wants to speak to
[1:02:48] us
[1:02:50] and many times you know we don't want to
[1:02:51] listen
[1:02:52] and people don't want to listen to what
[1:02:53] god has to say why because sometimes it
[1:02:55] doesn't come through the right person
[1:02:57] and you know and they don't like the
[1:02:58] person that's saying it and you know
[1:03:00] they don't like the way the person says
[1:03:02] it and and you know they don't like they
[1:03:04] don't like their english or or whatever
[1:03:06] else that you know they don't like the
[1:03:07] color of their necktie whatever else the
[1:03:09] problem is you know they always have
[1:03:10] some kind of issue with it that they
[1:03:12] don't like
[1:03:14] and you know it's like you know that
[1:03:16] when you when you want to
[1:03:18] if you have if you need to find a excuse
[1:03:20] why the lord's all or the devil's always
[1:03:22] there to give you an excuse or whatever
[1:03:25] you want
[1:03:26] no matter how flimsy it is
[1:03:28] and but
[1:03:30] but you know they you know the lord
[1:03:32] wants to try to help people and and
[1:03:34] speak to people's hearts but you know
[1:03:36] it's what your desire is whatever you
[1:03:38] what your desire if you want to hear
[1:03:40] from god or not
[1:03:43] when we speak here when we look at
[1:03:46] so when we have this
[1:03:48] he said you have you asked not you ask
[1:03:51] and you receive not
[1:03:52] because you ask amiss
[1:03:54] so when we speak of this word i miss and
[1:03:56] we look at these things that that are
[1:03:59] that are improper and all these things
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:02] you know you think about all
[1:04:04] you know you
[1:04:05] all of this
[1:04:07] what am i you know just trying to put
[1:04:09] this in words but you know you think of
[1:04:11] something that's that is so
[1:04:13] sickening
[1:04:15] and something that's diseased
[1:04:17] or something that's rotten
[1:04:20] you think you think of all these things
[1:04:21] and people would rather hold on to that
[1:04:23] than what god has for them
[1:04:26] you know
[1:04:27] and
[1:04:28] here is a from the message uh the seed
[1:04:30] is not heir with the shuck brother i'm
[1:04:32] speaking and he says um he said it
[1:04:34] reminds me as i was coming from phoenix
[1:04:36] the other day coming to tucson from the
[1:04:38] meeting the spirit lord called my
[1:04:39] attention to something as my wife and i
[1:04:41] were going along talking and the
[1:04:43] children were asleep in the back of the
[1:04:44] car getting late called my attention to
[1:04:46] a hulk
[1:04:47] and i watched that hulk a little bit and
[1:04:49] studied him he's a very type of the
[1:04:51] church today
[1:04:53] now the hulk as we all know has lost his
[1:04:56] identification of his original creation
[1:04:59] that's exactly right once he was similar
[1:05:02] to an eagle is
[1:05:03] his greater brother a hawk was but now
[1:05:06] he doesn't fly in the skies no more to
[1:05:08] hunt
[1:05:09] his heavenly mana but he's he's gotten
[1:05:12] soft he don't fly in the skies anymore
[1:05:14] he hops on the ground like a vulture
[1:05:17] sits upon a telephone post hops along
[1:05:19] hunting for dead rabbits the hulk wasn't
[1:05:22] made to do that no he was made to be
[1:05:25] similar like an eagle now just like
[1:05:28] like the church it was made similar to
[1:05:31] the eagle it should take the place in
[1:05:33] the heavenlies but instead of that he
[1:05:35] it's got soft it don't fly into the
[1:05:38] unknown anymore into the blue no sir
[1:05:40] it's depending on its modern ways of
[1:05:42] adoption of education and theology and
[1:05:44] some man-made denomination looking for a
[1:05:47] bunch of dead rabbits half rotten that
[1:05:49] something else had that's right hopping
[1:05:51] along on the ground now you see that's
[1:05:54] right a hulk see that's what tails
[1:05:57] the eagle hasn't changed a bit
[1:06:00] it stays an eagle
[1:06:02] and brother brahma says in the in the
[1:06:04] message the queen of the south
[1:06:06] he said where the carcass is the eagles
[1:06:08] will be gathered together he said i'm
[1:06:10] talking about eagles now not buzzards
[1:06:12] i'm talking about eagles that like eagle
[1:06:14] food out of the word of god not out of
[1:06:17] some creed book or almanac but out of
[1:06:19] the word of god that teaches that jesus
[1:06:21] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:06:22] forever and he never fails he just
[1:06:25] remains the same living god amen amen
[1:06:29] and he continues only speaking to the
[1:06:31] queen the queen of sheba she was going
[1:06:33] on and you know she was hungry because
[1:06:35] she wanted to she wanted she had a
[1:06:36] desire to see those things that she had
[1:06:38] heard about the things that that solomon
[1:06:41] you know of all the people had been
[1:06:43] passing through the land and they were
[1:06:44] telling her about the wisdom of solomon
[1:06:46] all those things that she had seen that
[1:06:48] they had seen and heard and they began
[1:06:50] to tell and it began to create a hunger
[1:06:52] inside of her it had a desire inside of
[1:06:55] her to go see those things and you know
[1:06:57] what when she made up her mind to go and
[1:06:59] see the things of solomon then you know
[1:07:01] what it didn't it didn't matter what
[1:07:02] anybody else said whether whether the
[1:07:04] religious people wanted her to go or
[1:07:06] whoever else didn't want her to go it
[1:07:08] didn't matter she's like i'm going to go
[1:07:09] see this for myself because it has
[1:07:11] stirred something inside of me that i
[1:07:13] have a desire to go see that and it
[1:07:15] didn't matter that she took up all of
[1:07:17] her all her jewelry and fine things with
[1:07:19] her and to set off with her servants and
[1:07:21] she was going to go see those things and
[1:07:23] brother i'm talking about those 90 days
[1:07:25] through the desert and all the the
[1:07:27] perils that she had to go through and
[1:07:28] all the the dangers that she went
[1:07:30] through but you know what it didn't
[1:07:31] matter to her because there was
[1:07:32] something that was driving her forward
[1:07:34] that she was coming to that place and
[1:07:36] when she got there and began to speak to
[1:07:38] solomon and see those things and she was
[1:07:40] like all the things that i have heard
[1:07:43] and that and all the things that they've
[1:07:44] told me about all this she said the half
[1:07:46] wasn't even told well how great it was
[1:07:49] and when she began to see all of not
[1:07:51] just to hear the wisdom of solomon but
[1:07:53] to see all the things that were built
[1:07:55] and all of the servants and everything
[1:07:56] that was there she was just amazed how
[1:07:59] all of that was put together and how it
[1:08:01] was so wonderful she said the half
[1:08:03] hasn't ever been told how great it was
[1:08:06] and you know because if you only see how
[1:08:10] good it is
[1:08:11] you know because many people people you
[1:08:13] know they don't see how great god is and
[1:08:16] how what god has in store for you and
[1:08:18] they they just get so far but they don't
[1:08:20] go any further and not realizing how
[1:08:22] much greater things are in store for you
[1:08:25] just to hate it
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] now this is from the message the world
[1:08:33] falling apart
[1:08:35] and brother ram says now watch god he
[1:08:38] gave us a program the father's word
[1:08:40] and the true believer holds on to it
[1:08:43] because he can't help it it's the
[1:08:45] kingdom of god in him
[1:08:47] and like abraham he calls everything
[1:08:49] contrary to god's word as though it
[1:08:51] wasn't and if anybody tells you that
[1:08:53] denomination is of god you stay
[1:08:56] what like abraham if anybody tells you
[1:08:59] you must be sprinkled or some kind of
[1:09:01] little something system or something
[1:09:03] contrary to god's word don't you believe
[1:09:05] it you can count
[1:09:07] you count it as though it wasn't
[1:09:10] and you know about women cutting their
[1:09:12] hair and wearing slacks and all these
[1:09:13] different things and he said in that
[1:09:15] system that tells you that it's all
[1:09:16] right to do that don't you believe it
[1:09:18] it's false anointed it's a false christ
[1:09:20] it's against god's word the righteous
[1:09:23] hold on to the word of god because it's
[1:09:24] the program of god's eternal word he
[1:09:27] said when god made a man he made him one
[1:09:29] way made a woman he made him a nut made
[1:09:32] him another way made her another way
[1:09:34] there's two different covenants two
[1:09:37] different plans two different all
[1:09:39] together between them and they don't
[1:09:42] look alike they're not they're not look
[1:09:45] alike
[1:09:46] they're not to act alike they're
[1:09:48] different all together
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] and he said a woman they're trying to be
[1:09:52] like men and a man so cystified he's
[1:09:55] like a woman and i thought that was good
[1:09:57] i seen a woman the other day
[1:09:58] seen a boy yesterday in cincinnati it
[1:10:00] looked like mrs kennedy the kennedy that
[1:10:02] hair
[1:10:04] the way it was like that god wants a man
[1:10:06] to look like a man wants a woman to look
[1:10:08] like a woman
[1:10:11] said i tell you this jezebel system of
[1:10:13] the devil's got the whole world in
[1:10:14] corruption not a sound place sin it's
[1:10:17] all purified source source of cancer
[1:10:19] malignancy of the devil that's eating
[1:10:21] the very core out of the systems that
[1:10:24] they've got set up here
[1:10:27] satan is a vulture feeding this is so
[1:10:29] satan is a vulture feeding upon his own
[1:10:31] kingdom
[1:10:32] he's a devil
[1:10:34] he's in he's an impure he is the father
[1:10:36] of lie he feeds upon the flesh of his
[1:10:39] own people the devil
[1:10:42] now
[1:10:44] i
[1:10:45] i was thinking about
[1:10:46] i was listening to somebody the other
[1:10:48] day and they were talking about
[1:10:49] abraham
[1:10:51] and man i tell you what
[1:10:53] he was this man was talking about
[1:10:55] abraham and the seed of abraham and man
[1:10:57] i tell you what he was he was a little
[1:10:59] snippet of a sermon and man i tell you
[1:11:01] what he was laying it all down about
[1:11:03] abraham the seed of abraham and being
[1:11:05] christ and being christ like all the
[1:11:07] things that abraham went through and
[1:11:09] we're just like that man he was laying
[1:11:10] it down just all right down the line see
[1:11:13] to abraham man we're overcomers all the
[1:11:15] things man he was laying it down just
[1:11:17] perfect and then
[1:11:20] i seen another clip from him the other
[1:11:22] day and he was out there and he was
[1:11:23] laying it down and he was talking about
[1:11:25] paying tithes
[1:11:26] and he said well you know in the new
[1:11:28] testament there's no place that tells
[1:11:29] you we're supposed to pay attention
[1:11:31] and he was leading he was going through
[1:11:33] all these scriptures and everything like
[1:11:34] that but the only scripture that's in
[1:11:35] the bible that talks about that was
[1:11:37] you're supposed to give cheerfully unto
[1:11:39] god that's the only scripture that he
[1:11:40] was talking about he went through all
[1:11:42] that and i thought man did you learn did
[1:11:43] you ever remember your sermon where you
[1:11:45] preached on on the seat of abraham and
[1:11:48] you remember about seed of abraham and
[1:11:49] you just kept laying down the seed of
[1:11:50] abraham seed abraham going on down that
[1:11:52] line i said do you remember that seed
[1:11:54] abraham when he met melchizedek he gave
[1:11:56] a 10th of all
[1:11:59] he's like man that's really good you
[1:12:00] won't talk about being the seed of
[1:12:01] abraham until the time it comes time to
[1:12:03] pay in tithes and then we forget that
[1:12:04] we're belonging to the seat of abraham
[1:12:09] he was just amazing but you know i just
[1:12:10] thought you know that's the way people
[1:12:12] are they they just want to pick and
[1:12:13] choose what kind of part of the you know
[1:12:15] what i i want all the blessings i want
[1:12:18] all this but don't let me have any
[1:12:19] hardships don't let me go through all of
[1:12:21] this and don't ask me about my money
[1:12:24] yeah don't touch my any of my money i
[1:12:26] don't want to have anything to do with
[1:12:27] that
[1:12:31] but you know what it's it's if you're
[1:12:32] going to belong to the seat of abraham
[1:12:34] that it's in the good times and the bad
[1:12:36] times the hard times and the difficult
[1:12:39] times
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:47] but you know what if you're if you're a
[1:12:48] cheerful giver why would it why would it
[1:12:50] matter if you gave 10 or not
[1:12:55] i just thought that was
[1:12:56] kind of interesting how people
[1:12:58] you just hear people talk about things
[1:12:59] that just kind of stood out to me when i
[1:13:01] heard that
[1:13:04] says here christ is the king of kings
[1:13:06] and lord of lord the anointed messiah
[1:13:07] the believer holds to that word god and
[1:13:10] his word is one
[1:13:12] i and my word are one you and your word
[1:13:14] are warned they don't lean then don't
[1:13:16] lean use your own thoughts use his
[1:13:19] thought then you're a part of
[1:13:21] of god because his word and you become
[1:13:23] the same see then you're in the kingdom
[1:13:27] abraham called anything that was
[1:13:29] contrary to god's promise as though it
[1:13:30] wasn't
[1:13:32] see
[1:13:33] like man made things today we don't hold
[1:13:36] any of those things
[1:13:38] but you know if if you look at where he
[1:13:41] was talking about you know
[1:13:43] holding on to the things of of the devil
[1:13:46] and the things that the devil says and
[1:13:48] he says you know here they are putrified
[1:13:50] sores cancer malignancies and all those
[1:13:54] things and it's like well you know i
[1:13:55] don't i don't know if i want to give
[1:13:56] these things up
[1:13:59] well sometimes when you begin to see
[1:14:01] what what it actually is then you know
[1:14:03] what i don't want to hold on to anything
[1:14:05] the devil has
[1:14:08] i don't you know whatever whatever the
[1:14:10] devil tries to put on me i don't want to
[1:14:11] have it
[1:14:14] now he's gonna paint you you know he
[1:14:15] wants to paint a beautiful picture of
[1:14:17] all this he wants everything to look so
[1:14:19] beautiful and and everything like that
[1:14:21] and it's like but when you begin to see
[1:14:24] what it actually really is
[1:14:27] then you know what then you realize you
[1:14:28] know what it's not the way
[1:14:31] it looks
[1:14:33] you know i
[1:14:35] i was thinking about a story
[1:14:37] that we read in school years ago and and
[1:14:40] it was this uh
[1:14:43] it was this man who married this
[1:14:45] this
[1:14:46] new new wife and he was bringing her
[1:14:48] back to town on the train and and they
[1:14:50] come in and everybody saw her from a
[1:14:52] distance and was talking about oh how
[1:14:53] beautiful she was and and all her
[1:14:55] fineries and all these great things that
[1:14:57] she came with on the train and and
[1:14:59] everything like that and this man had
[1:15:00] lots of money and and all this was
[1:15:02] coming in and as they were all cheering
[1:15:05] as she come into town and they were all
[1:15:07] excited to see this woman but you know
[1:15:10] as they begin to get closer to her and
[1:15:12] they begin to see spend more time with
[1:15:14] her and and all these different things
[1:15:16] then they begin to see you know what she
[1:15:17] had a lot of flaws in her
[1:15:19] and there was a lot of things that just
[1:15:21] you know just wasn't as as beautiful as
[1:15:23] everybody thought they were and and all
[1:15:26] this as time went on then people began
[1:15:27] to realize you know what
[1:15:29] this ain't all it's cracked up to be
[1:15:32] and they were and it was telling all
[1:15:33] this and and so you know lots of times
[1:15:35] when you read stories in school it's
[1:15:37] like okay i read the story now you tell
[1:15:39] me what the story's supposed to mean
[1:15:42] because
[1:15:44] i don't know
[1:15:46] you tell me what it's supposed to mean
[1:15:48] it's like because if you don't know what
[1:15:50] the author's trying to tell you
[1:15:51] sometimes when you read these stories
[1:15:52] it's like
[1:15:54] i know what it i know what it says but
[1:15:55] what's the underlying what's the parable
[1:15:57] here you know what's the underlying
[1:15:58] meaning
[1:15:59] but the story the the meaning of the
[1:16:01] story was this man had great wealth and
[1:16:04] he was bringing this new woman in and
[1:16:06] she was bringing all these fineries in
[1:16:08] and what it was talking about was the
[1:16:10] change from the old agricultural way of
[1:16:13] america coming into a technological and
[1:16:17] mechanical
[1:16:18] uh industrial way of of living and and
[1:16:21] everybody began to look at all these
[1:16:22] great things and they thought man this
[1:16:24] is so beautiful because we're going to
[1:16:25] have you know all these great fineries
[1:16:28] and wonderful things all these great
[1:16:29] inventions are going to come in you know
[1:16:31] we're going to have washing machines and
[1:16:32] all these other things you know we're
[1:16:34] gonna have cars and and all these things
[1:16:36] everybody thinks hey this is so great
[1:16:37] they're gonna start recording music and
[1:16:39] and all these great things we think man
[1:16:40] this is so great
[1:16:43] and then all of a sudden later on people
[1:16:45] start getting into those things and
[1:16:46] realizing you know what
[1:16:48] it's not as great as you think it is
[1:16:52] so as we've you know as i was saying
[1:16:54] about where uh
[1:16:56] brother branham was talking about
[1:16:58] john and uh charles wesley's mother you
[1:17:00] know having 17 children and being able
[1:17:03] to pray with each one of them and all
[1:17:05] those things he said you know we we had
[1:17:06] all these all these things when we had
[1:17:08] to work on the farm and we'd done all
[1:17:10] these things and now we you know we're
[1:17:11] supposed to have more time and we've got
[1:17:13] less time for god and it's like you know
[1:17:15] we're supposed it's supposed to
[1:17:16] alleviate the burdens of our lives and
[1:17:18] all it does it takes up more of our time
[1:17:20] and we've we've lost we've lost the the
[1:17:24] time we think we're saving time and
[1:17:25] we're not saving any time because we're
[1:17:27] not any closer to god than we was before
[1:17:30] and it's like no so when you're reading
[1:17:32] these stories and it looks so beautiful
[1:17:33] and and it looks so great but when you
[1:17:35] start getting closer to it and you start
[1:17:37] to really dig into it it's like it's not
[1:17:39] as pretty as it looks
[1:17:41] it's and so many times you know the
[1:17:43] devil wants to paint you a pretty
[1:17:44] picture of something and he wants it to
[1:17:47] look so rosy and everything but when you
[1:17:48] start to get into it realizing it's not
[1:17:51] what you think it is it's not as great
[1:17:53] as you think it is
[1:17:54] it's not as beautiful
[1:17:57] but you know what you can't you can't
[1:17:58] say the same thing about god's word
[1:18:01] i tell you what the more you get into
[1:18:02] god's word the more it opens up the more
[1:18:04] beautiful it is the more fulfilling it
[1:18:07] is the more great it is and then when
[1:18:09] you get to a place where you can't you
[1:18:10] can't put enough words to describe how
[1:18:13] great it is
[1:18:18] this is from the
[1:18:22] this is from the anointed ones at the
[1:18:24] end time brother brown says he said
[1:18:27] he said no notice
[1:18:28] moses never give
[1:18:30] give them what was moses time he said
[1:18:33] we'll build an ark because that's that's
[1:18:35] the word you know noah built an ark one
[1:18:37] day no vultures was eating on that
[1:18:40] no no this is this is a promised word
[1:18:43] notice for his message he had from god
[1:18:46] he had the genuine predestinated word
[1:18:49] of god for his hour neither did jesus
[1:18:51] serve them moses leftovers moses had the
[1:18:54] word for that hour but moses was a
[1:18:56] prophet here is god himself see he never
[1:18:59] served them moses leftovers but just
[1:19:02] look at the vultures there in that
[1:19:04] organization was gutting over it he said
[1:19:07] we know we got moses we don't have time
[1:19:09] we don't have to have you he said he
[1:19:12] said if you'd have known moses you'd
[1:19:14] have you would know me because moses
[1:19:16] spoke of me see oh my i said where the
[1:19:18] carcass is the eagles will gather eagles
[1:19:21] the fresh kill of the word
[1:19:23] the word that's raised up and fattened
[1:19:26] that's been made manifest and give out
[1:19:27] to the food from for the children now
[1:19:30] the old carcass that's laid there for
[1:19:32] hundreds of years that that'll be
[1:19:35] there it'll be same now luther had a
[1:19:38] message of repentance but you bunch of
[1:19:40] lutheran buzzards message baptist had a
[1:19:43] message but you baptist buzzard see the
[1:19:46] pentecost had a message coming
[1:19:48] home now the pentecostal buzzer but
[1:19:50] where the carcass is he said there the
[1:19:53] eagles will gather
[1:19:55] so all of the time that you go through
[1:19:57] all of the the ages and all the things
[1:19:59] that that's taken place all the way down
[1:20:02] through the to the yes it was truth god
[1:20:05] had truth but you know what it only
[1:20:06] takes the truth of this day not any
[1:20:08] truth
[1:20:09] we build on what was said in the past
[1:20:11] but you know what you can't hold on to
[1:20:12] what was back there you have to continue
[1:20:15] on and you know because any of those
[1:20:17] things that you let down on any one spot
[1:20:20] and if you don't go further from where
[1:20:22] you are today then you know what then it
[1:20:24] all begins to get wiggle tails and it
[1:20:26] all becomes rotted it all becomes
[1:20:28] putrified source because you know it's
[1:20:30] wonderful to talk about what god done
[1:20:32] yesterday or done last year or 20 years
[1:20:34] ago or whatever like that but you know
[1:20:36] if if it's not greater today than it was
[1:20:38] back then then then we need to have a
[1:20:41] reconversion we need to get back in the
[1:20:43] altar of god because we need to get back
[1:20:45] to the place where it's greater today
[1:20:47] than it was yesterday i don't want to
[1:20:49] live on on the things that that have
[1:20:51] taken place in the past i'm i'm going up
[1:20:53] higher and higher and higher i want to
[1:20:55] continue on i want to because why
[1:20:58] because if there's a if there's a new
[1:21:00] fresh manner there's a new fresh keel of
[1:21:02] the word in the opening of the word
[1:21:04] today then that's what i want to be in i
[1:21:06] want to feed on that i don't want to
[1:21:07] feed on on the other things
[1:21:11] brother bram said when you when you
[1:21:12] recognize that the very word of god was
[1:21:15] eagle so he said you left the other
[1:21:16] thing he said it's time to leave all
[1:21:18] that other he said he said when you he
[1:21:20] said when you formed into the living
[1:21:22] image of the living god he said you've
[1:21:24] heard from your theology
[1:21:25] so when you when you've heard from one
[1:21:27] because you realize what the word is
[1:21:29] that you're hearing from it's what you
[1:21:31] are
[1:21:33] yeah
[1:21:35] i i tell you what you know it's hard
[1:21:37] it's hard to sit still sometimes when
[1:21:39] you realize you know i came from god and
[1:21:41] that's who i'm hearing i'm hearing from
[1:21:43] the one that created me i'm this is this
[1:21:45] is who i am
[1:21:47] why because we are one it's not that i'm
[1:21:50] that god is one and i'm somebody else no
[1:21:52] i'm a part of him
[1:21:54] when you realize who you are that you're
[1:21:56] a part of him when you're a part of the
[1:21:58] word amen when you're a part of the word
[1:22:01] made manifest
[1:22:03] then when you realize who you are then
[1:22:05] you know what i can believe what the
[1:22:06] word says why because it's a part of me
[1:22:09] i'm not believing somebody else's word
[1:22:12] i'm believing the word for me why
[1:22:14] because if i receive the word as the
[1:22:16] word has gone forth and after i've
[1:22:18] received the word then i've become the
[1:22:20] word then you know what then how can i
[1:22:22] deny the word just like jesus couldn't
[1:22:24] deny the word and god couldn't deny his
[1:22:26] own word
[1:22:30] because you know what i am that word
[1:22:32] amen well people as brother ronnie was
[1:22:34] speaking of you know when you're looking
[1:22:36] for the revival who is the revival i'm
[1:22:38] the revival where is the word the word
[1:22:40] is in me
[1:22:43] and you know it's like whether i i'm
[1:22:45] going to continue to claim that and
[1:22:46] believe that it's like well you know
[1:22:48] what you still got faults well you know
[1:22:49] we're all going to have faults but you
[1:22:51] know what i'm going to overcome them
[1:22:53] you know what there's still more grace
[1:22:55] to continue on
[1:22:57] glory
[1:22:58] it's not the man that falls down it's
[1:22:59] the man that gets back up
[1:23:03] i didn't start this race
[1:23:06] it was god
[1:23:08] god started me on this journey i didn't
[1:23:09] start it on my own i didn't choose this
[1:23:11] he chose me but he started me on this
[1:23:14] way and he began to continue and then so
[1:23:16] when when i realized who i am that i'm
[1:23:18] walking the way god wants me to walk and
[1:23:21] you know what if and i realize that if i
[1:23:23] get off the way if i get out of step if
[1:23:25] i get out of
[1:23:26] out of balance somewhere then you know
[1:23:28] what then the word of god is is
[1:23:30] obligated to come to me and speak to me
[1:23:33] to bring me back to bring me back into
[1:23:35] balance to bring me right back into the
[1:23:37] sight in the right place
[1:23:39] then you know what i can believe what
[1:23:40] god said so when i when i'm asking i can
[1:23:43] make my petitions known
[1:23:46] because that's my desire i want to know
[1:23:47] where i need to be lord show me where i
[1:23:49] need to be let me step into this word
[1:23:51] right here and feast on this word lord
[1:23:53] put me in the place that i need to be
[1:23:55] give me the words that need to be said
[1:23:57] that can speak to others in order to
[1:23:59] encourage them to edify them the lord
[1:24:01] just not just to be saying things but
[1:24:04] let's say something that's going to
[1:24:05] benefit the people let's let's get into
[1:24:07] the word and let's become the word
[1:24:10] and show the world who we are amen
[1:24:14] that's my why because god said in those
[1:24:16] last days that he's going to have a
[1:24:18] bride without spot or wrinkle or any
[1:24:20] such thing
[1:24:21] he's going to show the devil
[1:24:24] this bride this eve will not fall like
[1:24:26] the last
[1:24:28] that's that second he won because he's
[1:24:29] promised that to you then you know what
[1:24:31] whatever you have need of you can claim
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:35] then i can i will receive what's mine
[1:24:38] i've made my petition known i say thank
[1:24:39] the lord thank you lord because you've
[1:24:41] made that known to me i'm i'm claiming
[1:24:43] what's mine
[1:24:45] but you know what if you don't read if
[1:24:46] you don't read the wheel how do you know
[1:24:48] what your what your possession is
[1:24:50] how do you know what belongs to you
[1:24:54] but that's that's what we have this
[1:24:56] evening
[1:24:57] so god bless you let's all stand i want
[1:24:59] you i want you to be edified and get
[1:25:01] into the word of god whatever you have
[1:25:02] need of then you know what
[1:25:05] i'm so thankful that god said if you've
[1:25:08] got questions
[1:25:10] then you know what he said he'd put
[1:25:11] somebody in the pulpit to answer your
[1:25:13] questions
[1:25:15] praise god and you know what
[1:25:17] i think we got we've got a great
[1:25:20] fifo ministry here and if you have a if
[1:25:22] you have a need then you know what it's
[1:25:24] not it's not the men but i tell you what
[1:25:26] it's the god
[1:25:27] that's living in the in these men
[1:25:31] in this five-fold ministry that god will
[1:25:33] answer the questions
[1:25:36] and you know what because if you have
[1:25:37] confusion god's not the author of
[1:25:39] confusion
[1:25:42] he is the he's the author that he's
[1:25:44] going to bring you clarity amen right
[1:25:46] yes sir yes because the word is i said
[1:25:50] yes
[1:25:51] amen amen let's have the musicians
[1:25:53] coming
[1:25:56] so if you have a need this evening then
[1:25:59] he's here to meet your need that's right
[1:26:01] amanda
[1:26:02] and all you gotta do
[1:26:04] is i look like my little story
[1:26:07] you know all you got to do is that's a
[1:26:08] bank draft on heaven so all you got to
[1:26:10] do is fill it out
[1:26:13] and you know when you when you've got
[1:26:14] when you've got access to a bank account
[1:26:18] like wade
[1:26:19] when he had a business you know and you
[1:26:21] had money in the bank
[1:26:22] and you had to write checks and and do
[1:26:25] things like that you know when you write
[1:26:27] checks and everything like that you
[1:26:28] don't have to ask them because you know
[1:26:29] what it don't belong to them
[1:26:32] it's your money and i'm gonna do with my
[1:26:34] money
[1:26:37] so if it's your possession that god gave
[1:26:39] it to you then it's a bank draft on
[1:26:41] heaven then you know what then you know
[1:26:42] that don't be afraid i you know because
[1:26:44] let me tell you what
[1:26:46] if you have kids they they don't have a
[1:26:48] problem spending your money
[1:26:52] unless unless your kids are different
[1:26:56] i ain't met a kid yet don't mind
[1:26:57] spending your money
[1:27:00] i think it was i think it was levi
[1:27:03] levi was a what was the most generous
[1:27:05] kid we had
[1:27:07] he had friends and he hit by him ice
[1:27:09] cream and and all kinds everybody needed
[1:27:12] something he was buying it up and he'd
[1:27:14] always and sarah was trying to figure
[1:27:15] out where all his lunch money was going
[1:27:18] it's like listen you can spend your
[1:27:19] money like that quit spending my money
[1:27:21] like
[1:27:22] it's to help some folks out but not in
[1:27:25] it
[1:27:26] i think about what margaret thatcher the
[1:27:29] former prime minister of britain said
[1:27:30] the problem with socialism was after
[1:27:32] sooner or later you run out of other
[1:27:34] people's money
[1:27:36] that was a problem you're running out of
[1:27:38] our money
[1:27:41] but if you have if you have
[1:27:43] the money
[1:27:44] then you know what then spend it
[1:27:47] yeah to get the things that you have
[1:27:48] need of it's a bank draft on heaven
[1:27:51] yeah
[1:27:53] so you know because you know
[1:27:54] healing it's it's the it's the
[1:27:56] children's bread it's yours
[1:27:59] you don't have to worry about it
[1:28:02] will god heal me
[1:28:04] it's already finished work at calvary
[1:28:08] so whatever you have need of and it's
[1:28:09] like well i i've
[1:28:11] if you're seeking the holy ghost now you
[1:28:12] know what it's for you it's a promise
[1:28:15] that's right
[1:28:16] and he said well lord i'm born again but
[1:28:18] i don't know where i want to come the
[1:28:20] statue of a perfect man
[1:28:22] i want to get these virtues then you
[1:28:23] know what they are required but you know
[1:28:25] what god's made a way for you to get
[1:28:27] them
[1:28:28] then you know what there's and there's a
[1:28:30] prescription right here if you get in
[1:28:32] the word and you begin to feed on the
[1:28:34] word then you know what it comes to you
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:40] and so it's just like everything else
[1:28:42] it's as you feed on the word and you
[1:28:44] grow
[1:28:45] and the lord begins to reveal things to
[1:28:46] you he begins to open the word to you
[1:28:49] right
[1:28:50] but you know what it's it's not it's not
[1:28:52] hard
[1:28:56] all right
[1:28:57] you know you know
[1:28:59] i know y'all won't believe this but i'm
[1:29:01] going to tell you anyway
[1:29:02] it might be hard to believe
[1:29:04] but you know what i didn't have to
[1:29:06] struggle
[1:29:08] and strive and go through all of this to
[1:29:10] get this big
[1:29:13] i know y'all won't believe that but
[1:29:14] that's true
[1:29:18] you know what
[1:29:19] because i used to tell you richard not
[1:29:22] here but i used to tell her he's kidding
[1:29:24] he said well
[1:29:25] aaron was on like his 30 seconds before
[1:29:28] i could get to my second plate of food i
[1:29:29] was like well you're slow yeah
[1:29:32] i come to get mine i don't know about
[1:29:33] you
[1:29:36] but you know what you know it's like you
[1:29:38] know if if a whopper was is good a
[1:29:40] double offer is better
[1:29:44] if a big mac's good a big mac two big
[1:29:47] macs is better
[1:29:49] and that's and that's that's how you get
[1:29:50] here
[1:29:54] if one shot piece of chocolate is good
[1:29:56] two's better
[1:29:57] and what you do you just keep on you
[1:29:59] just keep on feeding
[1:30:01] well let me tell you something it's the
[1:30:02] same way in the gospels
[1:30:06] if one message is good then you ought to
[1:30:08] have two
[1:30:10] man and you know what if if and
[1:30:13] and it's i talked to people and i tell
[1:30:15] them i said you know what they sing that
[1:30:17] song sweet hour of prayer i think this
[1:30:18] reason they took it out a lot of
[1:30:20] churches because nobody ever does it
[1:30:21] anymore people people couldn't figure
[1:30:22] out what an hour
[1:30:24] of prayer was anyway but uh
[1:30:27] maybe five ten minutes whatever but you
[1:30:29] know what if prayer is good then you
[1:30:31] want more prayer yeah
[1:30:32] he said how do you get closer to god he
[1:30:34] said if you just read your bible and
[1:30:37] pray
[1:30:37] then just continue to feed and you know
[1:30:40] i i
[1:30:42] i like being at work i get on the roof
[1:30:44] sometimes by myself and i i put my
[1:30:47] earbud in i get my phone out turn it on
