========================================

foreign [Music] faces I hope everybody is comfortable your bellies are full I want one person to be uncomfortable the devil I want him to be so uncomfortable that he leaves this way and God will come in and just bail us off that's been my prayer for months brother Andre and I have got together and thought that we would put this together I know that some of you don't know us because you're younger but we used to come up here seven years 80. and and then life and and things happen and and uh some of us run away from the message some of them stayed but now we're back together again and we don't worry about the path we're looking toward the future we're looking forward to the future of the future home so that we can get out of this place but we've got to be United together first we've got to be able to can't live together here we're not going to live together that man [Music] somebody say amen amen thank you but that's why we come together to Fellowship one with another we're going to hear the word of God that's the most important thing I appreciate all of our this is our people here come from Spoken Word Church in Lewis Georgia we thank you all for absolutely another call your name but but I know what language for sure brother Jerry where yeah Lee you wouldn't even have American hot dogs being promoted to guys not only systems in the local assembly we are sure to appreciate that brother Andre has been a friend for a long time and we sure do love him and we appreciate him and thank him for opening the door to let us come in and I told him I said you open the door bro we're going to take over so but we want to take over for the Lord amen we don't want to take over for any publicity we want to take over from the Lord so we brought a big group up with us and we sure do appreciate each and every one of you we appreciate brother Joel Brown coming in and speaking for us and he's a real servant the Lord he's a local fellas so he's not far from here so we appreciate him we there's one thing for sure how many people in here are left-handed Dorothy raise your hand you're left-handed aren't you left-handed people you're gonna have a preacher tonight that's in his right mind brother Joel Brown is Left-Handed so he's going to preach to us from the right side of his brain we sure do appreciate him being right we had a we have a meeting a couple years ago I think it was me and you and another narrow Ward and I told the congregation I said man you've never seen three preachers in their right mind in one place we were a good big wave of you and good to see you let's enjoy ourselves brother Joel I mean I keep looking over there not y'all we got brother Joe over here he's going to leave singing about Andre but before we do if anybody has a an unspoken prayer request I know we don't have time to to call them all out but if you'll just raise your hand to the Lord I know we all have special requests family and friends somebody that's sick and let's just bow our heads and pray for these needs Heavenly Father Lord we pray tonight that that you'll meet every need father because every hand that was raised defied gravity they raised their hands Lord to you but now I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that you'll touch every need Lord some physical Lord we pray for our families and friends and different ones Lord that are not serving you we are sick even here in the building father and body and we pray Lord that you would lift them up Lord for your honor and Glory father we pray that you'll take total preeminence of this service tonight Lord use each one the musicians song leader music's one in a special way Lord and just be with us now in the further on this service we give it to you father in the name of Jesus Christ Amen brother Andre now when we get finished we can hang around in Fellowship there'll be more food to eat so they'll bring it out and we'll be able to Fellowship around the food also but let's Fellowship around the word of God first God bless you research unless you may be seen for alone would say the nicest thing you can say to anyone is God bless you amen and God bless you and so we'll get to see you here tonight we thank the Lord for giving us this opportunity as David said in Psalms 133 how good and how pleasant it is well together in unity and again our lord said in Saint John 17 when he was praying to the father that they made me want amen towards the holy spirit that brings that Unity now the body in this and this is Brother Brown have said the same the holy ghost that justified the lutherans that Sanctified the Westlands that baptized the Pentecostals is uniting the broth of the Rapture in the South and when we seek the move of God damn it how thankful we are for me and my brother Wayne who under the leadership of the Holy Spirit knowing that it would take the you if there is anything we want to get that behind us and put it under the blood we want to do that amen how thankful we are tonight to have brother Joel brown with us and I've been knowing brother Joel for many years and we appreciate you and his ministry his lovely family we thank the Lord for our wonderful pastors here brother Sandra Dale has meant so much in all of us all of us I remember when I was doing missionary work down in the Grenada DNA Islands in a place called Pizza me Monica and I met this saint there and she said to me brother Andre I have a tape and I've learned so much on predestination and I asked her who is the pastor who's preaching on that tape she said it's a brother Samuel Dale do you know and I said I am married everybody [Applause] we love you and we thank you and I for the ministry that God has given you has just been a great blessing to us to know our position predestination and foreknowledge election ordination many things that you've taught us over there through the scriptures that's helped us to know who we are and where we come from and so we thank the Lord for our precious brother Dale and you can't forget sister Peggy and she is so special and except the community thank you assistant baby I'm not quoting from a country song that we love a lady that stands by her man unless you really amen amen how we thank the Lord for brother Wilson Anderson Wilson what a teacher of the scripture amen you know when I first heard brother Wilson many many years ago and there was a couple of Brothers Brother Joseph Kansas and I Brother Moore and different ones and I thought Mom what a wonderful gift that God has placed in Brother Richard Wilson's Ministry his life man and brother Wilson you are indeed when Jesus or the Apostle Paul quoted in Ephesians his father speaking of the gifts that God gave to his body office gifts that he put for the perfecting of the Saints and one of those gifts not only pastor but also a teacher to be able to teach and show us where we are in this scripture and so let's just give the Lord a handful of them [Applause] and of course his lady too sisters we're their neighbors they've been there for many years and so they were making reference to the neighbors but the other neighbors and when they were talking about the other neighbors I was telling my wife I'm glad we're not those Neighbors but we thank the Lord Janice he is such a lovely lady and God has rich with blessed her and her husband she's got a lovely family with you yesterday and just had a great time and and brother uh Terence and his wife they've been looking after his mom and dad there and so it started to get ended by Wilson's son also amen and we want to say this how we thank the Lord for you all making the sacrifices to come up from Georgia well in reality I am the Georgia Boys George is always on my mind when my wife is not on my mind George is on my mind but I I'm I'm thankful for the sacrifices you've all made all of you so I see you right I know your names and when I can just thank Lord they come up I had tears rolling down my face when I thought Lord give them traveling nurses folks that are coming up and with stop to get something to eat or they get gas in their car and so it takes sacrifice to do that if you did not have to come someone to come we're not able to come right but you did come and so I want to thank you all for coming and being with us and showing that as the Apostle Paul said we're many members but we're one God Amen Christensen Haven right we're thankful for all these wonderful musicians that they brought up and of course I always thank the Lord for my dear friend Brother Joseph Canada and I want to say this you know and then I'll hush I apologize being intimate for so many years and missionary work for so many years 20 something years of missionary work different countries that the Lord has permitted me to go and helped start churches and etc etc nothing that I had planned to do only the will and the grace of God Amen but when I see this group that we have here in Irwin Tennessee yeah I love them Erwin I love you amen I've worked with with the Venezuelans with the in Colombia in in in in Brazil the islands lived in grenade all those places the Lord has sent you you're all beautiful you're all wonderful the group here that God has I said I'm your brother I love this group in Irwin and we don't want to you know I'm a former U.S marine we don't know so I think brother I've been with all such a foundation and always standing for True amen and him and his wife his family we lifting up Sister Sherry there yeah no in this time the precious time for her and all these men in our church there's some that are not here tonight they all wanted to be here we're thankful for that and one more thing and then we'll give it to Brother Joseph it's a special day today I remember my mother she's going to be with the Lord but she told me a long time ago it was her birthday and her birthday is February 15th and she asked me she said Andre she said you know what today is tomorrow it's February 15th and she said shame on you and I said shame on me he said yeah it's my birthday and you forgot it you get my birthday on your mother and so from that time on I never forgot my mother's birthday I always and then when I my jobs I would pay my mother every year I would take her to Florida she loved to go to Saint Augustine we'd go to Saint Augustine we'd go down to Disney World and she didn't care about Mickey Mouse but she she loved Universal Studios and those places and we'd also goes to SeaWorld and then head over to Busch Gardens and then on our way up to Okeechobee in those places I'm only saying that to say this it's just it's another ladies birthday today to special lady we love her here her husband my dear dear friend by the heart he went to be with the Lord there a year or so ago and how we miss him and love him looking forward to seeing him through Resurrection but won't you put your hands together for sister tree Peterson is her birthday today [Applause] okay [Music] Disney go it is anyone anyone things are already different so it took how many is nervous raise your hand to be nervous I got mine up I bring you greetings from Word of Life Church formerly Happy Valley Reagan's pastor and God is just good that's all we can say now it's not so much that you know who I am other than Joel Brown I'm just an old simple country boy from Virginia originally grew up in a holler no running water we carried in total fence just like the prophet talked about just simple poor people and um you know but one day I met somebody who changed my life forever now I grew up in the message per se I was about two years old my mom began you wouldn't have receipt for just a moment when my mom just to do a little bit of an introduction to get rid of some of my nervousness I know some of you are wondering because there's nosy people everywhere you go now this is just me I'm gonna be me all right because quite frankly I don't know how to be anybody else so if you're looking for somebody that you can just tweak a little bit and make them do and say what you want them to do do I need that one okay so if you're looking for somebody that you can manipulate I'm not the man I'm not the person huh just a just a a simple simple guy but coming to know before my mom was about I was about two years old and my mom started going to a message church so I grew up in the message and I was familiar with that voice but but one day when I was in college actually almost 21 years old there was just something happened in my life and to this day I I I don't remember the exactly what was said I went to a meeting on campus it was a minister there uh just a denominational guy and he held Services periodically and just something spoke to me and said it's your time it's your your time so there was no uh flashing lights the ground didn't shake and all of that but it was just my time and maybe something to tonight will be said in this service that will change your life forever now there's two things that I'm certain of two things that I'm certain of for this service is that I'm a simple and I know that I'm supposed to be here [Music] and because of those two things it allows me to know one more thing that there's going to be somebody whose life is going to be impacted now the Bible tells us that those once you are converted strengthen your breath now I've come to say it this way those of you who are Sanctified who are saved and are okay in your walk with the Lord you can strengthen your brother your sister that's sitting beside you by saying Amen to the word of God because that amen will begin to create an atmosphere amen praise the Lord but God is good A little unconventional this is it totally completely out of the ordinary for me I was so I was talking about being nervous I was so nervous I forgot to print out my notes so don't don't be don't be fooled by this thing I don't I don't do it you know this is this is not me this is not how I normally do things but so with that being so I know God's going to do something special amen God is good I don't think I'm gonna sing I won't do that I I do say that I don't think so God bless you musicians thank you amen so this is a youth service how many young folks we got in the place tonight praise it I expect to see every hand because see we're on our way to an eternal youth service so we're just getting in practice for that youth service let me ask that question again how many young folks we have in the bill amen get stirred up tonight praise the Lord if you have your adoption papers stand with me your Bible that's your adoption paper saints come on now I need some amens I can't do this hmm well the way talking about left-handed total and preachers being in our right Minds I hope to give you my whole heart tonight yeah but my heart accepted the door dropped in my heart to give to you a special gift from God himself amen turn me to be the first Samuel 17. first Samuel chapter 17 and verse 40. my my isn't God good isn't he wonderful while I'm thinking of it my wife my two sons and our three sons are here and some of our friends from South Carolina some of our family friends from South Carolina but one of one of one of the young girls had a she had a seizure episode right before they was getting ready to leave all remember her in prayer it's the devil stirring once again but God is good first Samuel 17 verse 20 so they they would have been here my wife would have even been here if she wanted wanted to come 40 and it reads and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in the script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Felicity let us bow our heads Heavenly Father it's an honor of standing before your purchase or tonight and orders I've already shared with the people I'm just a simple person and I have nothing Within Myself to bring I have no agenda no objective I have no ulterior motive other than to show forth your glory and to express your heart to your people tonight or God may we be changed by the things that we hear May that we be changed by the things that we receive that we know that your word is light and your word is life so illuminate our paths dear God by your very word your very presence change even more so now the atmosphere in this room you come on the scene and do what only you can do and do as you've done many times before in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have deceased it's good to know the Lord is it not but you know I'm sharing with the brothers yesterday some of them even more so it's better to be known of him there are so many people that can say they know the Lord but does the Lord know you has he came and identified himself within you the prophet tells tells us that in the message hearing him I think back in 1956 he says we must be inspired by the word of God listen that will bring God to his word and make it act and do like it did in the days of old so the word in itself will do nothing you can sit and you can read the word of God but the prophet tells us we have to be inspired by the word of God and sometimes I heard this just the other day sometimes when we read the word of God there's no effect there's no emotion there's nothing happens it's just it's just dry but that don't mean we stop just because that's so because even in the natural realm with natural food you don't stop eating just because you didn't like what you ate you come back and you get some more and eventually it's so Inspire your taste buds that you wanna you wanna go home and make that very thing [Music] so maybe something will be on the buffet tonight that will suit your taste and you will take it home you say I want to concoct that same recipe at home but to be inspired by this word of God now in our opening scripture and I pray truly that I won't be long and I'm really not a long-winded preacher but I know a big God with a lot of things to say I'll just I'll just place it that way is that all right but I I want us to to just think of the thought uh this evening the choosing of the stones we're all familiar in fact this very story David and Goliath is probably one of the most told stories in all the description we've learned it since we were just a little bitty talks little bitty things and so we've heard it over and over and over but something a few months ago captivated my heart with just this very act alone of him going to that Brook and choosing those stones he was preparing himself for battle [Music] and he didn't even realize what he was up against he didn't even know what he was going to be faced with he didn't even know what he would hear that would cause him to be truly hunted or inspired by God himself but the choosing of the stones and so I sang in my prayer we know that God is light and God is life and and we know how the prophet displays it that that God in his mind he had all of these thoughts and these attributes and he wanted he was just God he existed by himself he was just God with his thoughts and he began to express those thoughts and and the way the prophet places if you all forgive me I'm gonna shut up right here oh Mom if if you all the folks didn't have to have every word y'all again y'all got the wrong guy blame it on another way he was the one that called me you're welcome but the tremendous effect of the word of God as it went forth as he spoke those things the prophet began to say was like a a clinker he spoke it and and and those words projected out and it it failed for maybe millions of years and then he stopped it it was a storm was the Earth all of these things beginning to come forth but but as he projected those words there had to be something to receive those thoughts those words there had to be something that that would be a receding post for what God was giving out and there there has to be tonight in this service there has to be somebody someone to receive this word because God doesn't do anything without purpose God has never been without a witness since the beginning of time there has always been someone who can testify to the realities and to the the the fullness of who God was to give an effect to to respond to what God was doing so a receiving post there's something that that's going out that's being projected and just because it's not happening within you right now just because it may not be happening at your church the start of one man Lou it's not a one Church move it's a body move as I often said so many times you get up in the middle of the night and you stop that little bitty pinky toe on the bedpost the little toe I don't know how that thing hurts is that right and what do you do that one member you take these five or these ten things that you go and you minister to that need God said to tell you that to say this if you know somebody's in trouble don't just dismiss them because of who they are and who what they've done to you or what they said to you you go minister to a need this is about a new way let's shut up the receiving post the prophet says and if you can be the receiving post to receive the word of God then it's real to you listen to how he says this then it's real to you and it'll live like it was then people say well I want to do something for the Lord be a receiving host and the moment that you receive something from him to receive the word of God then it becomes real to you huh the voice of God is ascending post so there has to be a receiving host and the voice begins to pulse out in conduit or carrier of the juice as the old folks is as I said I'm just a retouchable way we called it juice when I was growing up you flip that switch you know forgive me like we didn't flip a switch we pulled that chain in the center we didn't have switches just poor old chain in the middle of the of the ceiling light bulb screwed in to a socket but there was juice there was power [Music] yeah and so here we have in in the natural realm of that that very thought the power of the juice there had to be a carrier of that current that circuit there had to be something to carry that and from the line to the transformer into the house and and all that these reducers and all of these things so all that is the juice or the power once you've become that receiving post everything that the juice is everything that the power that the two embody is now in in you and it'll make you walk right it'll make you talk right it'll make you treat everybody wrong we have to love Saints that's that's the embodiment of who Jesus Christ that's what he came to do is to show us how to love and if we can't love right then we've missed the whole thing don't care how much you rally around God sent a problem if you're not loving right everybody everybody don't care what they look like what they smell like what they've done what they are doing what they're going to do we have to love and I love what they're doing but we have to love but this juice this power sometimes there's an interruption in the connection and what happens there's no more power everything goes quiet you're gonna flip that switch and nothing happens you sit down to read the word of God and nothing is ignited nothing happens because somewhere the conduit has been clogged somehow someway you've lost power but the reality with that thing is the power has to be restored in order for you to be sustained in your life in your journey you can't go through this Walk of Life without the power the juice of God you can't do it especially with the forces and then everything that that's encroaching in upon the land today because it's encroaching him it's it's tight yeah you've got to have power to escape these things the choosing of the stones we're we're here we're just filming Foundation but there has to be a restoration of power and until that power is restored till that force of Life comes back into the house so to speak into the body is is the the house as far as it being a house is no longer effective it can't function in the fullness of it being a house you can't function fully as a child of God if the source of if the power is not fully coming in yet [Music] the pulsation get this yet the pulsation this is simple I know but I'm a simple person because you know my I say this constantly my simple understanding is going to Simply get me out of here one day I have no desire to try to complicate this thing in fact I don't know how to do it anyway only thing I know is to tell how I know it thank you tell it how I know it but even though there's an interruption in the source of power the pulsation is still there the fullness of its potential has not diminished in force the fullness of its potential has not diminished in power or ability God is going to be God with you or without you [Music] you may think that you're all that and that God really needs his work done no he don't he don't belong because the power of that juice the power of the the force the fullness of that power is still pulsating it is trying to get it's still being carried through the line it's trying and it's right there it's right there at the socket it's it's right there all we have to do is plug in get connected you think you can stay away from church no that's not gonna work no you've got to be connected to the source of power and oftentimes all it takes is inspiration to get that that power back on [Music] inspiration on the spiritual side of things we find out in Matthew 26 Mark 14 and Luke 7. we're introduced to a woman who didn't realize she was recently she that she herself was a receiving post for the power of the most high God she didn't know it Mary the prostitute she didn't realize who she was because the circumstances of her life the things that she had done brought up on her a reputation that was vile and looked down upon upon by those around her because of the circumstances saying that she herself had done regardless if it was something that happened in her life that caused her to be be that way or things that that took place in her life is irregardless in respect to what I'm trying to bring tonight but the fact is where she was was not giving her the ability to know that she could be plugged into that source and as the accusers begin to throw their tongues around at her and all of these things were going on and we know that it was there the feasts at Simon's house you're familiar with the story and I know you're well versed in these things so I'm gonna I'm gonna skip on a lot of the details you all just kill it in later but even in the midst of where she was and her condition of her life and all of these these these men railing accusations that are wondering why she was here Jesus said to her of the accusers he said let her alone let her alone [Music] sometimes we listen sometimes we go to Medellin where we don't need to be mental Jesus is saying let her alone because you see saying self-righteousness will always always cause you to overlook others and exclude them from the economy of God a self-righteous spirit will exclude and keep me oh it's just gonna be me ain't nobody saved but me ain't nobody saved but me ain't nobody saying well maybe two or three ain't nobody saving me self-righteousness will cause you to exclude others and it's always some practices is always ready to send others to hell and not realizing the state that they're in is going to take them there too is that right it's tight Saints remember the prophet talked about that woman she was walking that line in those High he'll choose and they got a little more narrow to what the furthest and the closer she got and she began to wobble and Teeter take off your spiritual high-heeled shoes I pray to God you don't have any real ones on it's by the way it's false so here she was she was trapped in a condition that nobody would ever think about that trapped in a condition that no one was there to help him she might herself even believe that there was no hope for her because she's gone so long in this lifestyle hearing things trapped in that condition [Music] she's gone so long in that that she began to believe it possibly even herself and after all she was the one that committed these acts it was her there was nobody else that didn't she was guilty of the active self and the things that she did huh now you cute folks can think that I don't I believe that that you've never done anything wrong if you want to we forget where we come from sometimes sakes I know we were Justified just as I never did I know all those quotes but self-righteousness will keep you out of the Kingdom praise God for our position in Christ and where we are but there's more to this thing than you I gotta find a hiding place [Music] but the thing is she happened to come upon a scene one day and the outcome would bring power back to her house she came up on the scene Jesus with dirty feet weren't for me with the the message that the prophet spoken and I'm always amazed at listening to that how it would just break him he just began to weep and cry and he couldn't you know the leadest man I know and all these messages just break him couldn't even preach but here Jesus was with dirty feet how could we come to a service and not welcome him in [Music] young people you've got a role you have something to do you can wash his feet too and then you can do these things brother Brown says of Mary here he says that she only had to be inspired to go into action she only had to be inspired she wasn't even supposed to be where she was she was already doing something that probably illegal or that that she wasn't even in the proper place but inspiration struck her heart she peeped through and she saw him there she said how in the world could could this I've heard about him and now I see him with my own eyes how could it be that he's sitting there with dirty feet how could the people come to the house of God with Andre how could they be hearing the word of God and just sit there and not be inspired not being who I don't understand it I know the problem talks about my people the black people being you hey inspiration will cause zizo white feet to move sometimes too tell me I'm wrong huh because he said anything without emotion is what dead what do you do with dead things you bury them huh okay all right that's okay don't be scared don't be afraid but inspiration she only had to be inspired to go into action she went forward without anything listen to how the prophet words is she went forward without anything showing she could do [Music] there was nothing that she could lay her hands on there was no scripture there was no quote of the prophet lay your hands on and say definitively I can do this thing no she was inspired to do what she did and he goes on to say and she went forth on her inspiration [Music] we are well familiar with the story of Job gather into the stones talking about inspiration being that con being that that receiving post here we have another individual who who was hunted by inspiration but the thing was even with job he too lost power to his house is that right everything that he knew everything that he had he lost it was gone even his wife was talking crazy his little sweetheart his Queen so somewhere along the way he lost power but unlike Mary that we were just talking about Job the prophet talks about Joe had the mechanics in order he had everything he he he he he knew all the rituals he he had it all in order the mechanics were right there he was just lacking the Dynamics in Prophet said now message folk don't like to hear those things my Dynamics let a storm will come ruined in your house you know the thing about homosexuality and why am I going here morning Mercy little thing about this that that very thing is it's it's it's it's round against until it happens in your house dude comes knocking on your door yeah until it's your little baby your granddaughter have mercy is that right but Joe he was just lacking the Dynamics and it's interesting I think the prophet says Joe needed a Channel of inspiration he had it open Mary didn't even have a channel to know that she could be a receiver of power and here you have an individual that had a channel and he had it he even had his channel open because the prophet says he had a channel to communicate with God by his inters job was a prophet prophet I ain't doing that I don't shut up on that I'll get in trouble but he had a channel to communicate with God by his inspiration he had listened away the prophet I love this he had a way of moving himself out and let the word of God move it oh my job had a way of moving himself out of the way and giving God the opportunity to move [Music] I shall not be I shall not be moved that's what some people do they sing that song and they moved one in 50 years shame on you you're going to a land of Eternal Bliss we're going to a land of Eternal youth he said when my back hurts I don't care praise the Lord anyhow not being told us to her I just have to praise the God praise the Lord anyhow [Applause] sometimes we gotta praise our way through our circumstances [Music] [Applause] Joe couldn't get a word from God but the prophet says I love this Joe couldn't get a word from God but the devil couldn't move him yeah I haven't heard not speak and deal with me I haven't felt the move of God in years but the devil could not move you you young people let that be your foundation tonight you settlement with your walk with the lord the devil is not going to lose me even though he slayed me I'm still gonna trust him because the prophet said Joe had a grip on God could you could you imagine that this Prophet this man of God he had such a grit on God why because it was a revelation and once you get a revelation there's nobody anywhere that can take that thing away from you from you it don't matter if Mama understands that Daddy understands that Grandma who you love with all your heart understanding it's a revelation that's just for you [Music] I was preaching just a few weeks back and as I was ministering this little thought just dropped so real into my heart I was just speaking about how Mary when the angel of the Lord came to her and spoke those words and she said be it unto me let it I will I receive it I'll do this very thing to you that you're wanting me to do yes did she understand it no could she fully comprehend it no but she said I will and the moment she did that that eternal life that she was to protect and shield think about it a little teenage girl here we are to you a little teenage girl received a word from God and said I will protect this word with all that's within thee and when that word was burnt forth it changed the world forever yeah and the way the thought came to me then was this the as the word is going through even tonight is the word is going forward if you will receive the word of God and allow that word to be birthed in you and you protect and shield the prophet says you protect this message the way that it's going you will receive it and protect it eventually you will give birth to the very word and that word that you protected that God instilled within you that entrusted you and it will change your world somebody that you would have an influence somebody at school you said well I'm homeschooled maybe it'll change your daddy my kids pray for you Mom and Dad pray for your dad Lord first Samuel 17 1 says now the Palestines gather together their armies to battle and we're gathered together at shokon which belong us to Judah and pitched between shoka and azika in ephesdament that word sure God means bushy but the thing that captivated me with this verse in particular is this the Philistines had gathered together the enemy had gathered themselves together on land as the Bible says that belonged to Judah what's due to me praise the devil had done camped out on their praise This Is My Land this is my territory this is my opportunity this is the place where I praise the Lord this is my home this is my daughter this is my son you don't have to knock up from the Devil because the enemy the Philistines have come together on the the land of Judah he's coming to approach himself upon your land of praise no doubt they have started out the the the the Felicity said staked out the land beforehand and and and thought this will be a pretty good place um you don't think the devil's not plotting on you [Music] right since he's seen how you've been reading your Bible he's seen the sincerity of your heart [Music] and he's staking you out he's watching you because he's going to try to come in and take your praise he's going to try to come in and take your experience but don't let it [Music] the prophet talked about how the the uh the serpent how he courted Eve he took his time he staked out that land huh and coming on down through chapter one go read it later but again you're familiar with the story we learn of and are made very familiar with Goliath we learn about his stature how big he was and we learn about his position his Rank and he was this Champion oh champion we learn about his posts we learn about his armor but how he was dressed and how he was arrayed and all of these things and we also see how his words cover the valley with depression and anxiety you hear me now depression and anxiety is such a strong Spirit that's attaching itself to the youth today listen it's time you be set free if you're battling with that thing depression anxiety suicide now the the thing is many times you talk about certain things and these are real things that are happening in the land today but as parents sometimes we don't want to talk about because it's uncomfortable you might be setting your child up for Destruction you have those hard conversations listen Mom listen dad you have those who are tough conversations with your job even if you had it last week have it again if you see the new the news there well you take it whatever you want you know [Music] [Applause] but his words covered the valley with depression and anxiety he made his voice verse 11. when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistines Watch what it did they were dismayed and greatly afraid because of the words of the devil made them afraid greatly afraid not just fearful but greatly afraid that we're dismayed means to be shattered be dismayed be broken be abolished be afraid be scared to be terrified how many's been afraid before [Music] praise God we got some saints Among Us that never been afraid of anything I want to rub shoulders with you tonight get a little bit up on me but we're trapped in this thing called time and these sometimes circumstances and things happen that we'd be shaking in our boots but even yet in that time that present time that the circumstances that they're railing around us and the winds are blowing we can stand steady in our faith knowing that our God is more than able because Goliath's message if both depression and anxiety running around saying well I've got like I live in the mess knowing that they're trapped they're on their way to hell hell the devil's pulled one over on them you stay in this word young people you stay in this word young man stay in it you say brother Joel I don't understand it you don't have to understand it be inspired by and say God I I I I I've read and I go to church and I hear the word I don't understand it but I believe it help thou my unbelief give me a grip like Joe had and nothing can shape me even death itself could not shame so he said they weren't just afraid but they were exceedingly afraid and I found that just humanly I understand it I get it but yet at the same time I'm thinking what these are the children of Israel vision of the stone that word Israel means god prevails so every time you see the word Israel and you read it in the Bible God prevails but yet because of the words of the enemy they were shaking in their boots and they didn't know what to do and after all Israel was God's favorite people they were called out they were they were the church natural huh they were the ones who were led by the angel of the Covenant which was Christ we've also been led by the Angels [Music] we received a sure Word of Promise we received the message that has transformed that once again the entire world but yet we found ourselves of Fame and fearful sometimes because why the enemy comes in and makes his boast so here we have these things going on Goliath in this battle and as we know the stories that unfolds on the scene comes Little David and this particular scripture this story rather it was before David before he was known as as we know him now of course all these great things he hadn't yet killed the lion 's standing on the scene but see David was just a teenager [Music] somewhere the historians and things say the the scholars and things say somewhere between the age of 13 and some even say 60 that most have it tagged between 13 and 15 but some put him around 16 so that puts him in your category Little David doing this mighty mighty wonderful thing so all of this is going on and David arrives on the on the scene with food for his brothers Prophet says in the message God is commissioning Moses the prophet old Goliath came out and made a great day [Music] that's more really get it okay but it comes out and he makes this great big boss in these he's he's laughing and he said it one too many times he said it one too many times devil it's time for you to shut up under expression not even knowing what he was getting ready to do huh there happened to be a little fellow over there just about so high you know with a little sheepskin coat wrapped around him and he said who's that guy you know probably you know he was coming to bring his brother's food I could just imagine maybe you know he's making this a little strong he don't know what's happened so far and he's just me and David just being a kid you know wow who's that guy and he looks over here and sees his brothers and sisters and all of the the the the hosts of the army rather and they're just shriveling and shaking why isn't that even fearful he hadn't yet got the report but even once he gets the report what does he do he stands firm in his faith because he knew if God can do it once he can do it again [Applause] but he says who's this fellow why they said that's Goliath not he's just got everything stumped around here and David says why do you mean to tell me that you will let that uncircumcised Felicity stand there and Define the armies of the Living God now Mom and Dad you need to tell me you're gonna let that little child of yours that's the spirit on that child is that right that's the spirit on it and you have the authority dance take your position in the home you have the authority if Dad's not there Mom you have Authority to bring that Spirit under control is it going to be easy probably not but you're called to do it God entrusted that little character into your care you remember that little baby that you just love so much you should have taught it something when it was three and four and five I know brother Donald he's mentioned so many times he says you won't raise your kids and then when they get 14 15 16 and they're they're just Wayward and they're just crazy and then you bring them to me and expect me to wave some magic wander and bring them to another Andre bring another wave of the deal bring them to the minister expect them to do something great for tremendous it should have started when they were just wee little bitty face well I want you to come back it's okay you're gonna hear the truth tonight [Applause] that was what David he says no sir Hallelujah there was a lot of fight in that boy nah yes sir he knows what God had promised and you need to tell me that you will let these uncircumcised for listening tell you that the days of Miracles has passed what Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's Hebrews 13 8 he either is or he isn't he intermented or he didn't now the thing is you either Believe it or you don't that's the summation of my wrong with the Lord God either meant what he said or he didn't and I had to believe it or I don't know don't care about all this other stuff you're trapped up have that cow eating grass in the top of a tree how the cow get up there you put him up there could you imagine what it would take to get a cowl up in a tree the working effort that it would take you to get a cow in a tree yeah but all that you had to do is believe the Lord how simple is that um and he said oh if some of you guys come out here and fight me this was a lot to say I will make you a proposition now when the devil thinks he has the upper hand he's going to make a lot of proposals but the moment that he realizes that there's power that there's deity in you young sisters young Brothers Listen the moment the devil realizes there's deity in you you are tabernacling them deity is in you and the moment he realizes that he's going to back up the problem Illustrated it wonderfully he said we and I love that of all the quotes in the message the one that I love the most with the comma and the word devil and that's boo think about it he said the Devil comes in making his voice and he says all we have to do is rise up within the strength that's within us and say food back foreign [Music] [Music] let it echo through these walls and across the way all the way through Earth and let it Echo out boom boom devil because he's coming in with such a force he's Mighty in the land he's a self-proclaimed champion of them all but there has to come some little Davids the choosing of the stones and I can imagine stated he heard that post and he heard that what the enemy was trying to bring now I'm sure he didn't just run down to the brick Brook and just well the the area there just snatch up some rocks he was deliberate and intentional with what he chose because why he was inspired because anything just won't do the problem tells us don't you let anybody just cram any kind of Revelations down your groove that just pick up any stones be intentional be deliberate by what you pick up because God's going to use it to do something tremendous choosing of the souls God had a little boy back there with a shepherd's coat on who knew God and knew God kept his word how many notes God keeps his word he promised us that he would do these things there happened to be somebody there that believed God David had that grip I believe Bill that had a grip on God just just uh uh as as as Joe had was covered over with steel all up and down like that just one little spot and here he comes across to be them a little bitty fellow about like this it collides about like that standing there with his Spirit ready to pick him up and hang him up on a tree somewhere here come little David just a bouncing in the spirit bouncing in the spirit he wasn't doing this he didn't come to church like this are you happy to be here tonight how many love the Lord no they've been come bouncing across the territory he come to church excited he come to church already stirred up hmm yes sir thank you well Julia wants to be like you know I want you to get a hold of something that will inspire you yeah yes yes he had five smooth stones and a sling five fingers wrapped around a sling the prophet tells us j-e-s-u-s-f-a-i-t-h sh that's what he had he got the things to working out and around and around and around he began to take that little sling begin to go around turn around he got it worked out just right he did what he had to do and witnessed the prophet says and when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in a perpetual motion in your soul not lip service huh but something working and stirring up in your soul or a Perpetual that's a big word for Kentucky hillbilly perpetual motion in your soul something's going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scattered young people this isn't too just for Mom and Dad this food is for you as well here David loves us the little bitty guy he was a teenager hear me he was a teenager doing these fine he got a perpetual motion and I love that Perpetual emotion in his soul and something's going to take place you discourage you're depressed you're you're you're you're under anxiety you're suicidal get some Perpetual emotions maybe something tonight in this message will just stir you up and say I will rise to my feet and I'm going to be that overcomer the Holy Ghost shot that rock that stone the Holy Ghost took that Revelation right up to that Philistine and killed it he goes on the same when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in the perpetual motion watch this something's going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scattered like Roaches on the floor in the summertime when the lights turned on roaches roaches to clean your room Joe I'm not talking about the natural roaches he's talking about these spiritual little things they are there all you have to do is turn on the light living in darkness you will never see the roaches come out of the condition that you're in come away from sin come away from depression come away from anxiety and flip on the right of the world in your life and allow the roaches to scatter and here's the thing SS scattering what do you do you go find them you go chase after them lunches yourself what these are my new shoes stop those roaches I'll buy you hey I'll buy some noodles oh man all right all right stop those roaches that's what the prophet said I'm gonna read that again because you didn't like it sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scattered like Roaches on the floor in the summertime when the lights turn on the reason why you don't think you have ruptions because you are you're not leaving the light on long enough you don't let the power go out in your source for the lights to come on and roaches all around you and they're eating your food the food that you pick up and eat too [Applause] hello cute Folk who is this for Blame It On by the way brother Andre oh [Music] roaches roaches roaches but it's always making me feel more I hope I do get it out of your life turn on the light get plugged in you go over that switch and nothing happened you're not plugged in the conduit's plugged up somewhere the smoke sack is plugged up somewhere let's let's get it cleaned up every time I start the principal brother I'm telling it send the rock to The Killing place I love that and downwind Goliath that perpetual motion that around and around and around and around it set the rock right to the killing Place David instruct this thing David didn't figure this thing out David didn't have the intellect David didn't have the ability but he had a God that was on the inside of him that inspired him to do something that nobody else was willing to do [Applause] maybe Mom and Dad won't do it young people you rise up and you do it do it you call a family time of prayer and I know things are crazy a time has been that time is approaching but just ain't so busy but you come Mom and Dad let's have devotion tonight you watch the atmosphere change it'll drop conviction in your daddy's heart I promise you I promise you want to see a change in that you want to see a change in mind you call the Family altar well you see the path that Mom and Daddy owned you see the destruction that they're headed towards love them dearly you call Little David little Mary you call you say be it unto me Lord I'll do it under your expression not even having the the know-how to do it you do it that you're saying I promise you therefore David ran and stood upon the Palestine and took his own sword drew it out of the seat thereof and slew him he cut off his head there with him so the thing with this the choosing of the stones and I know I said a lot but my thought this inspiration came with just the deliberateness that David took you can't just run through life you can't just have an experience you can't just come to church and you know that there's there there's more to this message than just this message [Music] there's more to God sending a prophet than God sending a prophet there's a life that comes behind it many people that will come up to Calvary and they'll camp out at the base account and that's a good place to be don't don't misunderstand what I'm saying but they'll just come to Calgary and they'll go no further but there's a life on the other side of the country there's something yet to do once you've come and let this resurrected savior yeah there's more to do 17 51. therefore David ran to stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out and just read that but the thing is with this one of the points I want to bring you is that once you kill once you destroy the bigger Thing Once you destroy Goliath what happens in verse 51 and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead what could they do they fled [Music] so these little things that are bothering you you find out what that big thing is and you kill it you destroy it don't toy around with it don't play around with it you destroy it if you have to unplug your phone if you have to get rid of your laptop your computer you do that if that thing is destroyed leading you to destruction you get rid of it [Music] Tick Tock keeping you up late at night get up and you're irritable in the morning you fuss it with your brothers and your sisters and your mom and your daddy shut it down your energy at least off on the devastated man y'all come with me together but you destroyed the bigger things in the others of the encampment will flee that word for listening means an immigrant they don't belong here they didn't belong in the land in verse one which belonged to Judah but they had encamped on that land to listings and immigrants huh so the illegals had gathered together on a land that wasn't even theirs all in order to wage a war the devil's coming into your house and saying he's going to start a fight no it don't work that way devil Mom Dad listen to me it don't work that way the devil's gonna come in your house ah it don't work that way it's all right so the illegals had gathered together this was judah's territory this was a land of praise and worship because David was just a little teenager now giant Slayers don't have to be old so many times we get in our minds as young people I didn't think well I gotta wait till I turn whatever age that magical age 21 whatever you know we think well I got to be old and before God conceives me no we've heard clearly we've seen in the scriptures God will use teenagers God will use and has used and will continue to use young people even to the dismay of the older ones that are doing nothing for him thank you David was a teenager but he took his time when he chose those rocks he had to make sure that he chose the right ones he didn't even know listen to this he did not even know he was going to kill Goliath he had no idea he just come out there to bring his brothers so much that's all he came to do you just show up at school one day with your backpack on your back not knowing that you're getting ready to kill her Goliath that thing is coming you at your locker day after day after day and you get more depressed and more depressed and you're more suicide no more more suicide but today will be the day that you kill that Goliath gang strip gain some inspiration yeah the people in the halls there at school they're not under the same inspiration As You Are right they're giving the victim and smoking and having uh sex and all of these things y'all know what's going on help me out old people sit back and requite about these things and our children and our children's friends are dying inside well it's not how I want to say I don't want to offend but you're gonna lose your child this stuff is real [Music] huh I done told you I know I'm supposed to be here and I know God's going to change somebody's life I know this word was supposed to be spoken it's broken up and it may not make sense to you but it's making sense to somebody we're closing shamgar his defeat listen his defeat was affecting his entire family year after year it affected they took their crops so they were dwindling away in their health it was affecting his family because he was being defeated by something over and over a besetting sin that in your life it's affecting your family yeah God Speak Lord because David's action caused a reaction and when David did what he did it brought courage to the Israelites a rock a stone is a revelation the power of God had been revealed to David and he took that Revelation and he put it into motion round and a Perpetual emotion he didn't just stick it in his pocket and hide it he didn't put it under a Bissell oh no I'm gonna let it shine David said huh this little light that I have I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna put it into action hmm these books and these take this message of the hours not to be kept on a shelf somewhere that's some little rally there's some little thing that we're fashion this is my message books on my bookshelves have you read one in the past huh put up to the preacher preaching what uh-huh no what happens if the preacher leaves what happens if the preacher fails whatever the preacher walks away from the message that's right is that true what have the preacher passes away what are you going to do what are you going to do a relic just tell something on me I've never been one that have that you know I love the things of the message but you know the little Trinkets and things that you know that that's all well and good not say anything against that but I've never really been inspired by those things so much that you know but I went to Jeffersonville one time and I went to ship's uh candy and got my little thing of a little uh another little hot thing red lights so yeah we got already remember but I had it on myself my bookshelf that's when I was single so it wasn't my kids and what my wife and and that was a brother that that was was coming into the message and he was living with me for a while and uh I came and I told him you know and I meant it and I still beat it now you know you come to my house we don't have much but what you have is yours if you need it but I told him I said whatever you need or the food I came home from work one day and brother had opened open red yeah my little trinket but we set these things up don't let this message set on the shelf and die there's life in this message foreign [Applause] [Music] he took God at his word and even among all the clamor of doubt and unbelief David still knew David had a revelation all the noises going on in the world today it does not matter if you have a revelation of who you are if you haven't realization of what what he wants to this is more than meat it's more than our natural me and here we are in a similar scene tonight it's being played out once again thousands of years later we have to put a string the washing of the Water by the word the port the stream is Flowing is that light here we are once again and a giant is coming into our land and he's making a ghost and he's telling you young people you can't live this thing you cannot do this that's what he's boasting that's what he's telling you but take courage Little David and go down by that Brook and you find use of stones you find yourself f-a-i-t-h you find you some j-e-s-u-s and you take that thing in your hand and you put it in Perpetual that word means constant you can't slack up on
