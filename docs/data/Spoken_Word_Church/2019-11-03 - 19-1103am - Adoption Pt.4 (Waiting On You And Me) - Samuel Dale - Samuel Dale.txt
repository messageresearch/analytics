leaving up there and come down here all winter and you know cuz I'm 40 and 50 below that no way no way Lord don't send me that away won't work amen but bad to have him with us we had a real good time yesterday in the the kids and the Bible study and the things and all the fellowship and all it worked out real good and I thought you know we had a good time in it and I hope you enjoyed all of the things that went on so let's give our the hands to the ones that you know took it and done it and and done their part to make it to work that it would work and it did work out real because it's in there so we appreciate that remember now the Bible study will be at brother homers I'm excuse me and brother brother Tony's on the third Saturday fellowship meeting okay get it brother Tony's on the third Saturday of December so keeping no no I know it's November but I'm trying to think I thought we had one in December I guess it is November okay November the third Saturday in November and brother Tony's okay remember that and everything 3:30 in the afternoon so just to be in that amen and 7 17th of November having our time together brother all tickle be here the Lord willing with us in December and preaching forests are the weekend of the the church together and you know that we have two times together or I don't know so remember that one will announce that any other Father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you for everything Lord and we just praise your great name and we honor you and we ask you now that just be with us and coming this Lord you take over the service and just have your way in your that your heart and your love dwell among the people because that's our desire more than anything to see where we're at right now where we've been where we're going is wonderful but where we are now is very very important and guide us Lord and keep us forgive our sins you said you sent your word and healed us so remember all the sick ones among us sometimes and just touch these wounded remember sister Rebeka their Lord having a lot of problems touch her and all of the others that are sick lord have you where our hearts and desires there's one thing that we could Lord live before you as you desire for us to be got us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name I mean if you'd like turning these scriptures turn to Hebrews 11 and then we'll go to Romans 8 he roos 11 and Romans 8 they try to continue our thought on the adoption and also remember those things okay Hebrews 11 now I want you to think all of these in Hebrews 11 they're basically now you can interrelate the life story verses of Hebrews 11 to come down to fear talking about us but the basics of Hebrews 11 up until you get to the lies - its reverses is actually to Israel all right now I want that in your mind because when we say it later on I don't want you to flinch or what women see it ends up by saying they went out us cannot be made perfect well now even if you had Jacob even if you had you know Israel even if you had just Joseph even she had one or two it would still have the same meaning right that they're waiting on us okay now what is our thought that we've we've having we're talking about adoption but what not looking back not looking forward but looking where we're at right now because to me that's the only thing important is what's happening now I was listening to her reading yesterday or day before wonder and brother branham it it shocked me what he said he said the sign of the end was the material building the building have you ever seen a time when they're building like they are now I mean these homes coming up there's there's just condominiums there's everything coming building is running just right down the road he said that was big one of the signs would be building and going on cuz you know the what is it and is it anyhow it says crash you'll prosper and things like that you know we'll be in this day you know and all of those things but just remember that okay so think about it now don't get lost in well now that's the bright no that's not the bride totally here so let's pick up what we're talking about on verse 33 and read down through this to pick up 11 to 40 okay who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword cut the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed violet in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised is to laugh again and others were tortured and accepted the and others were tortured and exit not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yeh moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins see that can come right down to where we're living right about us you can and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in the desert and the mountains and the dens in the caves of the earth these are all having obtained listen and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise all right now they didn't get to promise what God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect all right that means complete that doesn't mean you were going to raise them up and preach to them in things it means to come to full points or what you're aiming at all right now let's go to Roman's eight twenty-two and twenty-three where we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word as I said what's been our point not to look back that's great that's faith builder right because you can see this did happen it took place but not to look back to that because that will not change you that is already past it's done it won't change you all right now the future is out beyond so if your thinking of the future being beyond how can anything beyond where we are now change us were rad so let's get to right here let's get right where we're living and just think about it as I said about that listening and thinking of a reading there and the Prophet said you know all of this building that was going on it's a sign of the end well alright all this be able to going on the side of the end that was his point that he was making and showing what we could look at we can look around us and see the things happening in the world today and realize the end of all things that's come upon man alright and in doing that then we can say our time is at hand when you see Jerusalem compassed about all right like I'm saying the other day you know there for a little while they kind of pull back away from them not all the countries in time with a pull back away just a little bit back a few years ago but what do they do it now slowly gradually putting our troops right back into harm's way you know and see it's compassionate about on all sides all right now see then that means this is the day because that'll that's our thought that's what we're talking about now the Prophet said and it will read it in a minute when is the time or today that was to be like it is today of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God all right what is manifestation well we think it as being great signs and wonders okay that's part of it we think it's the dead raised the sick healed and the thing and we and that's part of it but our problem there is we say I just don't see that going on no more oh we saw it in the Prophet but we don't see it now well wake up look around the world I can stand here and preach about the denominations and show you they're having a great revival in a lot of respects right look like more than us but that's not what it is what is manifestation is to make known well see that's to me is all that I've ever thought about on making known as one thing if you make God known he'll make you know if you just make him known if you go out and talk about him and testify and do the different things like that and I'll he'll come behind that and heal the sick and cast out devils and do all kind of work why because you've brought him on the scene by your testimony about him are you're making known of him all right no see then we firmly believe that God sent us a prophet and he brought us the word we're not looking for another one to come we believe the word that we have and all but we believe that it has to be made known that's all that I'm trying my best to do is to peace to speak to you about what the Prophet brought to us and having to make you know doing with that being something that is being made known not future and not past I'll keep saying that over and over because that's where I want your mind thinking I want your mind thinking of what's happening this day because it was a time came to our that Jesus when he stepped over he said this day this scripture is fulfilled no all right out of 6,000 year or save for thousands or some 5,000 years up to the iron he was making something personal that day this day can we make it personal if we don't see it as to where God is personal to each one of us then what kind of a God do we have what are we doing what what's the point thing and like I said now you remember this point you make him known brother branham made God known and then what'd he say he said now if I've preached the word let him come well you know he never failed to come why because he's made he'd known even though the Prophet would say he'd say starting now I don't know whether he'll come or not right well because he's God he can make up his own mind what he wants to do or not do they said how nobody said we'll believe it well you know what he never failed he came on the scene and and brought the word through the Prophet all right now if that's the point then if it's a manifestation of the sons of God that the whole world is waiting on then it was not just and I don't mean derogatory I've been playing will you always have been that it's not to say that it's just waiting on the prophet to come he's part of it I think God there wouldn't be anything else there wouldn't be any manifested sons and daughters of God if the Prophet had not have brought the word how much more honor could a give to that and see that that means I'm not tearing it down I'm putting him up he's the one all right but to us to just sit down and wait I don't agree even though you might know exactly what you're doing I mean to me I'm like this if I knew three days from now God was gonna come at a certain time of the day what would I be doing I'm supposed to be planting potatoes ahead right is that his way of making it natural I'm supposed to be busy about wouldn't you want to be busy wouldn't you want to tell everybody wouldn't you want to call everybody and say the Lord's coming in three days yeah because I mean why would we like run around I remember your saying one time he was talking about you know you say something about God being this out of the other and it scares people and he said why would you be scared Wow why would you be scared why would you you think that brother Dale you shouldn't preach so hard you scare my children you know about the day that we're living I think it's time to defer them to get scared you know I think it's time for them to understand what's taking place right now I think that's what we've been missing and that's my whole point now so we we start from that to do all right now then as I said about Romans we take Romans to come up with the point of looking at there is to be manifested sons and daughters of God and the world everything is groaning waiting upon the sons and daughters of God to come on the scene to make him known right see if we think as I said I'll repeat it again where we understand we think that it signs and wonders well don't worry about knowing that's going to be signs and wonders that's my old point that's why I'm trying to get us looking something right now I turned the denominational world and their signs and wonders taking place there's healing tzer's delivered since there's all kind of things yeah until I say it and without words no backing up that sometimes look like they're doing better than we are listen it can't be based on that but it's got to be based upon what the revealing of God's Word because there is the making known it's not your standing up now I want to introduce God to you everybody here you do see me standing right here you know no but it's not signs and wonders and things like that either all that's well and good but it's when you preach the gospel because the gospel is the power of God unto salvation you say well I'm a woman I don't have to preach we preach to your kids all right but now follow that thought now as we go through because looking then taking that the whole world is waiting on you and I that's my thought for the point waiting on you and I all right now so if we're if the world's waiting on you and I we ought to be started trying to get on the line to what to find out what do you know we're we're living in what we're taking place on it see and then what was our last thought now our last thought was dealing with the dispensation of adoption the time of adoption all right now there was something now I'll click there so wait you you preaching Wednesday okay you ain't gonna believe in going on away you are for winners okay okay huh you're leaving Wednesday okay how do you get through preaching Iran are you gonna be here with him see he's in the moving process so Aaron I'll be ministering Wednesday okay now get that strap oh we go but all right waiting on you and I now if you're waiting on something it doesn't mean that it's already priced a little no Piper you know here if you're waiting on something it can't be what was you know heist that's done right yes that's plain sensible right they don't need a revelation it's finished you're not waiting on them to have a or go to the moon no they've been to the moon so all that's done so it's not waiting on it like that alright but it's neither is it to say I'm waiting on the future because a lot of things can happen alright and it will take place that what the world waiting on will take place but it's not waiting on a time or date or it's waiting on a group of people that's that's the thing that I've always tried to get you to see it's waiting on you with what part of God that you have we've all got to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ all right now the Prophet said it I didn't he said that God is not complete without you well I this it was waiting there's there can't be as we're gonna read it in a minute where he says waiting on the manifest is right right here now it's not out there in the future all right let's see get the point of Hebrews the Hebrews 11 is talking basically of the Old Testament people now I know what goes with this line god I know the story but listen to what I'm talking about the Old Testament people are waiting on you and I no no no that was waiting on Jesus go well alright Hebrews 13:8 doesn't mean anything in bringing Saint personal to you yeah but Jesus ray see I'm sory gonna say I know that people say well the Old Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus now in the New Testament we're waiting on somebody else yeah they try to make that part of the story but one night the story like that well not make it like it is you realize those Old Testament Saints are not in the seventh dimension they're not in the presence of God now if it is the Bible's wrong cause it said that he's the only one that's reached the immortality all right no all right they were waiting on him to raise yes they were waiting on him to come yes but that part never done anything for them right because they didn't accept it all right we're here in the end to her that they're waiting on you and I now we're gonna read what brother Branham says so you can you can argue the point was with him he says the Old Testament people waiting on you and me well I went way back under yeah they're not in there want to be right state all right then when it says how long how long they're longing to be changed and brought to a different position so they're waiting on something to take place if you understand what I'm getting at we'll catch it when we get back on another message or to see here is the day that God sent His Word right the Prophet came in this day to bring the word all right he had a lot to do in what he was doing okay and it's identically laying out to the same order as to the Lord Jesus and and what he done the Lord Jesus had a River Jordan right then he had a time through there of manifesting God then he had a time he had to go to mount Transfiguration okay that's no problem brother Branham had her Ohio River and then he had a time down through there trying to teach us the word all right and then he went to Aaron you know after Arizona met with the angels of God come back and preach the seven sails I saw well and good but you know what brother Branham said about it you've got to have your own Mount Carmel experience you heard him say that you've got to have your Mount Carmel I've told you about it when I was there in Israel you know and when we got to Mount Carmel well I learned is a great big image up here like you know Elijah with his foot down on the heads of the prophets Bale you know a veil and a big old knife and all like that well that was what everybody's going to look at this our lives are doing it well I enjoyed that but I just walking around and you know not going around looking and Peggy was following me and always walking along and while I said dirty wish I was looking for Sun you know what I was looking for they were how you pronounce that the Madonna though the Virgin Mary I knew there had to be somewhere because Mount Carmel was Catholic so I was looking for the shrine to her more than I was to a logical I knew what Elijah done but I knew also that would be there so I had to search and in there it says you know and I thought how many people's looking at this thing and some of them can even see Elijah but not seeing who's really in charge because Mount Carmel was Catholic Reverend said all of Christians have a Mount Carmel experience you're born to get experience and they were coming out of denominationalism the Mount Carmel experience see then that all ties together that's what I'm trying to get you to think about see those Old Testament Saints then they are waiting on you and I because the only one that has reached their mortality is the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham when he went beyond the curtain of time he could not see the Lord Jesus he said he's above he's in another dimension now he couldn't do it we think we can do it no he couldn't do it he knew then he had to come back and bring the message to try to draw it dark he could see people dark but the people that I was depending upon him right that's a wonderful experience we're not two and brother round them up to a great big thing or not belittle laymen are doing we're trying to put him in the right place the world means a lot but yet to be there ourselves see they're waiting on you and I did a lot of people don't believe I was trying to get that point to you about dispensations I know the quote from brother Branham he will say one time I believe in dispensations you say the next time I don't believe in dispensation no he says both ways I've seen I don't want you to get lost and and we talked about dispensation and then you come up with a quote we look at this quote well see I'm already telling you the quote I've already studied the story alright see then that dispensation means a time a place position or whatever it can mean or Authority it can mean a person you know to deal with words dispensation honor but what would be our dispensation it's the dispensation were that we come to the position to realize who we are and what we're doing here why are we here I'll even drop in a little bit to you we're going to think about later the Lord Jesus wouldn't adopt it on the River Jordan it was adopted on the Mount of Transfiguration drop a little thoughts to you what do you think about that so what are they saying that all right then when I make the point see then you if you're listening you'll catch it all right listen but he said dispensations one time he'll say I don't believe in it negative time he'll say he believes in it but I tried to express that with allies point there last week of what of thinking about why would he make those statements that away and to realize then what he's saying is you can't change if you change you got the wrong dispensation you don't try to change it you leave it like it is and words that in Hebrews 13:8 of either the right point all right so brother Branham wasn't looking for a time to come that would change things what was he looking at what was happening was wonderful and all of those years it had been the message he was bringing and that was the dispensation comes to me the dispensation of adoption when we read here and the Prophet said that it was waiting on you and me to me that dispensation started back in the days of the early ministry of the Prophet and that's what he's here for to bring us to a time a dispensation a positional point in word that we can believe what we're doing here and think about why we here and think about why has it been 50 years just the going of the Prophet because we've been in a dispensation a dispensation that he started preaching in the 30s it wasn't meaning that it wasn't here before that's what's the work on how to get to and we'll get the message part of it those disciples listen we're in the dispensation of adoption of their day but that adoption part of their day was not the headstone coming it was not what we've looked for well yet they were not fully manifested adopted sons and daughters of God into bringing forth the word to change the bodies what the prophet picks that up cuz you picked that point up as we go along they watch them this is the time all right go ahead let's read number number three brothers well back up to number one let's get it if I this have to do with its read and we'll we'll get it eventually you know we'll get changed we've on the other side and we sat down talked about okay listen what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God the making known of the sons and daughters of God if you don't see your day in this hour how can you be in the manifestation okay it's waiting for the church to become in to its position who was the sons of God when Adam where was his domain the earth he had dominion on the earth is that right he wasn't LOL l a-- him then he was jehovah and that is i am god and I've made some lesser ones under me who's that that's been kind right and I give them a Dominion and their Dominion the meant Dominion under them is the earth what was Adams domain the earth he had full control of the earth right that was set for him all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested another was wrought their way they're waiting on somebody to stand forth and say this is it right so what did the Prophet come forth he come forth back there in the 30s started preaching the great teachings of a lot of things he hits we don't go but 247 but then you jump up to about 1950 and he preaches the message of of the inner veil they've changed the title to another title later but go read that message and look at I'm talking about a living moving instrumentality walking on two feet of a people of God he was already preaching those things the denominations couldn't follow him because they knew nothing of adoption and I told you we taught adoption but we taught it as just a basis of an adoption that didn't relate to us having anything and surely we couldn't go on to the adoption of the change of the body call we all had to get us a new one cause we're smoking winter we couldn't do those things we'd waiting on another body well I showed we didn't understand what the Prophet when he did he didn't beat the pentecostal he tried to correct the pentacle he said that's where you've made your mistake thinking you've got everything to start with and he said you just got to the beginning no wonder he wasn't understood then surely as he goes along in the message and progresses progresses more and more they got less and less to be able to understand him but listen and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested do you believe that well I see that brother Branham back yonder I've seen him back in all right now what you gonna do come on if it's back there I remember the story if it's back there you can't depend on that part well of course it's already finished and see it was it was not to be just the Prophet he was to come to make manifest make known God but where did he make God known or deported brother on him like God don't in a bride right it's that problem is that any trouble he made known abroad he was part of that bride didn't you know what he was waiting to Sam all right he's in the grave now weightings not that's just too much now you're doing away with ain't doing away with nothing I'm telling you the truth you're the one that's got it all built up doing away with something ain't doing away with nothing yeah I'm still standing exactly where I was nineteen what 58 60 excuse me I believe you damn I believe it now what there's no way in the world you and I could ever come to a change of the body outside of this prophet come on roll it on up a little to the next one is that right waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this is ours there's my spirit flowing free nobody's exampling what's taking place you know there he is that I can work here get him another one over here and place him I can place them adoption placing manifesting taking him out and put a put a saw ceremony on it visit him with an angel tell him something well didn't brother branham come and make god no and then God took the prophet to the backside of the desert not in Arizona and made itself known to it he give him something he told him to come back to Jeffersonville it would mean the seal food we may know what if I always tried to teach to you what is the headstone the seal because that's part of the word and the cornerstone was the work so what about it and if he's told the truth now if he's just making up something like we were talking there kind of yesterday this this man in a certain place years ago he got up you know he's young and Overlord is a minister he got up and he said I take every spirit in this building under my control and I'm not making fun of it making no light I'm just telling what I thought okay I thought God don't let no demon in this building because he ain't got no authority over it and I ain't either so I know what's gonna happen the door is going to open he's gonna leave and I'm gonna be left so I said Lord don't let nothing come here he ain't got what he's trying to say he's got those he left town orden what's the money okay all right listen now if he's told the truth if he's just making up something won't work we've seen that it don't work we've had a lot of that but I mean but I mean manifestation of the sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends him out now how does a child of God go how did God send his son he came down and went in him right is that true now he came down and when he how did he send astir he came down and went in his church so it's him in the adoption not me and you this is not now I'm gonna say this it's gonna sound contrary to what that the point I'm trying to make but it's not he's not coming to make you and me me and you manifest God's coming to make yourself manifest the words God he's in me and you so automatically it's gonna make us manifest that's pointed out trying to get want to go we make him know he'll make us known right all right then he goes forth and what he says is true what he does is the truth what he does he manifest Christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word now how do you judge a son or daughter of God how they stay with the word all right jump on over to number two which is questions and answers on Hebrews until the Gentile dispensation now you people that don't believe in dispensation what about that that's what I don't understand it comes over here he says he believes in this Messiah over here he says he don't believe in this one so you get what he's talking about he don't believe in changes there's been no change listen Luther brought justification Wesley brought sanctification the Pentecost were brought to baptism when the Holy Ghost the Prophet stepped out on that right and he believed what they believed and stepped out with them because they were teaching the baptism of the holy ghost or it hasn't changed there's not a dispensation of let's say already than anyone said there's a dispensation of the Holy Ghost he says these discipline stations of John the Baptist but now put it all together and all that you've got what have you got you got Christ made manifest this is making known our Father it's not the son being known that's where we're going wrong in our thoughts listening to the point trying to make a son now it's us making our father don't see that we make him known he'll make us know right come on kids you you go to school and everything any and you ashamed of your mom and daddy and you walk around you know and you ashamed of them or you know what if I do if I seen one of my kids doing that when he come around for the paying ticket he'd be the problem when he come around to say daddy I need some money on sight I've not see daddy you want to go you had a daddy some whorehouse cuz and I'm on that you know you're crazy I agree we but it works alright so if you don't believe in dispensations you're out but don't believe in a changing dispensation that to me is what the prophets doing don't believe in things changing to another thing it's not it's the same Holy Ghost can I quote the Prophet the same Holy Ghost that justify the Lutheran sanctified the Methodist is now setting in order to coming of the Lord that God can pour into us his fullness and the Baptism and take us in the rapture they changed this is the same Holy Ghost that come on the dev's of Pentecost see and come right on down into the day of reducer Street Pentecost it's the same Holy Ghost it's not something different it's not a different dispensation it's all in the same dispensation this is the dispensation of making him know when that prophet stepped out there that's what God was waiting on right he was waiting on one band that could believe his word and he was pleased to dwell anyway now that's all I've ever asked to be in you and all of us is God pleased to dwell in minyan if we have the new birth he is if we have the new birth he's pleased to dwell in it oh you make it live it no I don't make it strong enough listen let's go ahead then I'm trying to find out one yeah this is one won't go ahead and number number three blowing up number three under the adoption the mystery how much serious this is where we ended up the other day and the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then over into the New Testament I'd sewn together here well mr. Eve is coming mr. of his will mr. Evans setting of setting together remember it cannot be taught in a seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now read that with common sense what has been waiting for the foundation of the world do you read correctly I thought we're supposed to read all of us the same way and come out to the same point so listen what he said it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation in the world now there's a minister's been hidden with the Foundation's work I'm gonna read what he said on that in a minute so come on listen waiting for the manifestation of Sunday well what's been the mystery that that the whole world has been waiting on what's the mystery the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God God living in his people doing and declaring these things the adoption of his children that's the mystery come on [Music] you are you listening to what I said well ago but a run said to God he is not complete without you you realize then according to Christ the mystery according to Christ the mystery the bride is part of the mystery and is to be revealed that's what your prophet said recross the mystery go back to it and listen to it the mystery is the brightest part of the mystery what I said you make him known he will then make you known and he'll say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell I'm pleased to take what he says I'm pleased to do what he's calling for but if you can't see it in the bride now listen if you can't see it in the bride it you need to look back and see it in the profit all right if it was in the profit that means they've got to be somewhere somebody to finish this that's no problem Twyla no problem looking back or whatever I have no problem with all of these returns and administrators that I believe in it I just believed a little bit different from what a lot of people thinks about it but I believe it but see that profit came to preach the message and you know what you and I are the message that he come to preach that were the bride across where God made manifest that's what he says now look waiting for the manifestations of sons of God now watch what he said tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when you come in through and got into Lutheran Westland him it had fallen away so far until you didn't have the faith of the father's being dealt with right and you couldn't call that adoption town yet they were children we'll get to that as we go along if you'll listen you'll understand Luther name had the baptism when the Holy Ghost but they were children that were born into the family but they had no tutor they had no point it didn't he didn't send that because that's not the time of it because there's a long gap now I'm saying some things that eventually when I say it you'll in order click the Lord Jesus Christ stood on the River Jordan and brought his message three years he walked in that message right telling all the things showing all of the thought Yeti wasn't adopted to the Mount of Transfiguration because the hearing him never come on the River Jordan it came about a transfer garage right and you know he didn't have but a six months message come on you pick up right around his ministry in about sixty two spoken word to regional seed right in there or where he's talking about what is it uh is this the time search right in there 62 and you go through his ministry and you got three and a half years everything lays perfectly in top if you listen and think about it so brother branham didn't have a long ministry you have short ministry the Lord Jesus had a short ministry but we got so far away we've had fifty years that God is waiting on me and you 50 years since they're going to the Prophet waiting on me and you well I didn't know what's waiting on me well who's it white now a bus okay outside of this time when were there ever a time in the history that manifests the time to deliver all nature now he's getting into adoption about total deliverance he's coming into the change of the body right so that's not coming till this in time the next were self groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation of wine before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost would ever poured out before that all now that's Old Testament right and I'm down there there couldn't have been manifestation he it had to wait till this time I told you what I said while ago was you listening I believe this dispensation of adoption started with the prophets ministry back to her in like 33 or something when he began to bring forth that's just their personal opinion we'll see he had to go to Arizona and connect with the angels of the Lord before he could come back and tell you what the seals were right so he must have had his adoption he said well brother dad when do you think brother Branham was adopted I believe he's adopted dinner and it in Ohio River I don't you don't my Bible the church people don't have thinking about what the Bible means you take brother runs ministry and compare it exactly with the Lord Jesus it comes out right - exactly River Jordan Mount of Transfiguration Ohio River Tucson Arizona opening of the seals bringing forth of things the plan of redemption perfectly identically lays that away but now where's our part they've got to be a people to make the word manifest that's all I'm preaching there's got to be somebody to make manifest what the prophet talk I'm not trying to teach something else no I'm not trying to teach something else he didn't teach I'm trying to teach what he taught because only through that can it be broke all things is broke comes shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men right so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ too little join him and his church together why can't we believe then the Prophet brought the message but there's a fivefold ministry to take it on right how are you gonna get it all right listen go ahead to number five what was the Holy Ghost given for but now when we need it the Spirit of God raises a standard now what is the standard is that what he's saying the Spirit of God raises up a standard what is it what's the standard now Azusa Street you know had it fine but the book of Acts is you standard right come on I go way back there that was the standard now watch what he's just saying though Spirit of God raises up a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit and those who are resting out younger in the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you am I reading something strange the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into his and to us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture that was after a while that just those who are he wanted to talk about it later filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture for the rest that did live not for the space of a thousand years that's right just Holy Ghost filled people is what went in the rapture so we know what's going in the rapture all to go still people but the whole world is waiting on you and I you said well brother tail I want to find my place all right my place is in the word I know mine I'm a minister I know what I'm supposed to do that's supposed to preach the gospel I know that how that's to be what do you know yours it can be just a benchwarmer you remember the story that the lady that was cleaning the Pew in the church the seats and she was praying lord blessed this person here Lord blessed this person and just going down the line just cleaning the pews and spraying for the people that sit there you know what it started a revival it can work what about it authority go to the next one we pick up to hear him those that were at the end of something everybody knows that civilization can't stand any longer she's just weaving and shaking what's it waiting for it's way past view as it was in the days of Noah long-suffering it slapped over for the elects sake it's left over for the elect state way pious but God's waiting to get his church in order he's waiting on you and I may he grant the blessing now God now listen to the point where I'm trying to make we've read I know to God's waiting on you and I but we don't have nothing to do we just sit around waiting on the bus full of and God's waiting on you and I when he can pour in his fullness and the baptism and take us in the rapture you say well what's wrong why are we here fifty years and because we have I realize yet that he's waiting on us and what's it matter to me if it's fifty more I'm gonna be old but if he's ordained it to me I'll be right here right if he's ordained it to me I'll be right here what about you well I think don't know imma call it a fifty years a lot of times well you don't believe in God correctly then cuz why can't he bring us another hundred years what about God waiting on you and me I thought was waiting on him waiting on him to do what he wants us to call him on the same row try it sometime you know what it might work you know I don't mean that Crockett or making a joke I means the truth sometimes the reason we don't get what we ask well I mean what we're wanting is cause we don't ask for it I was just looking at one there's one right here somewhere close we're brother Branham it may be the next one where brother man's talking about it and he says not now you remember mark 11 not if he says if you say not if God says it if you say it and doubt nod your heart it take place well if it don't take place you know what I got enough sense know one thing boy ain't got writing my heart good he said it a lot let's quit blaming him and waiting on him and start moving out into the message 50 years it are the week we can move a little bit we order at least me to the basis that we're not flimflamming along in the message and don't know what this is what brother Sorrell said this is what brother listen said is that whenever we just don't know what to believe why did the Bible change did the prophets message know well I just don't I I just can't see nothing going on what does that mean it ain't going on at least you'll have enough sense to say that's what I think you know instead of trying to make it that it ain't working we have seen God move among us you're looking for great manifestations why not look at the simplicity and see that God has moved among yeah but he's that see there you got the whole time he's out there you know cuz he's poured out his spirit now if you're gonna holler he's out there I'll holler with you let's go out to our if you think God is more than he is here let's go there right oh you don't talk my language hungry way I talk different because I know what I'm talking about God is waiting on me and you he's done everything he could do he's give us the message he's give us tapes books etc until everything is our fingertips we just push a button we used to I have spent three months trying to find one quote to preached one sermon from back in the old days right now you just there it is and even if you do wind up with 50 you can still sit down until you find it because you know it's one of the 50 right and God's give us many shortcuts you know who I'm talking about we had to come through the dots to learn a lot of things but then you know that's all right I learned how to shortcut the message so I wanted to get what I wanted but when they come up with the winders that was exactly what I was doing I just did now the ability to shortcut it enough I could cut it from 50 quotes to 30 but when they come up with a Windows they can cut it from 50 to zero or one right he said what are you getting that I'm saying Church God has done everything he could do he has put everything at our fingertips put it to where we have it we can read it we can pull it up in an instant then what's he waiting on but God's waiting to get his church in order he's waiting on you and I may he grant that blessing what's he waiting for God is waiting now here's the emphasis will drop back the Old Testament Saints have not reached immortality you said I don't agree with that okay go ahead that's alright you show me how they can that's all I ask for when the Lord Jesus was the only one that reached immortality and brother branham verified it or cleared it up for it when he went beyond the curtain of time and he couldn't go where Jesus was he said well words all rest up Matt don't ask me but I know this has to be cubicles or something up in heaven places for these people to go because you've got foolish virgins you've got filled sealed you you've got a lot of things that God has to have a place for them to be because they're not dire we're talking about it yesterday he can run around and wet be under curtain or town he didn't see Paul's people he saw his people right why because the others was in another dimension and you can't put them in another dimension because you can only put them into six dimension so that six dimension must be monstrosity of people right because every Church ages there we get there in different places and brother Brennan went back there and saw his people he didn't see Paul's people he didn't see then he saw his own people and they told him he said do I have to go back and he said you know go back and they said well we're depending on that in other words what about this age depending on the Prophet but you see I can make it stronger than that from the foundation of the world to where we are today God was waiting to bring a message in this life days through a little man named William Branham to bring it to the basis of Malachi 4 and fulfill it he doesn't understand a lot of times if you don't believe me go read spoken words original seed he gets over there and he said Lord I got him out on a limb what can I do the Lord says pick up your pen and write he picks up his pen and rots and there is exactly his answer because in that he says as of yet God telling him he had to tell that prophet he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled there's a brother I won't call it or to put it on the internet but as a brother that said at one time he said he said to brother Branham said brother Branham are you Malachi 4 you know is that your ministry he said yes he said what why don't you tell everybody he said I can't do it he couldn't go forth and tell it he had to keep moving slowly see and he didn't know his part but when he told he was forward reading a seed oh what a part he had to tell he said to think about that new birth if you're born of the word and spirit he said it puts you back like who should have been without the fall what a wonderful thing this message has declared unto us to look at it and see that you're now are not just sitting here waiting we have supposed to have been studying the message to prepare now I don't make statements to make it derogatory and make it hateful or anything but I do make straight statements if you're looking for brother Branham to come back and preach now I'm saying this if you don't know what he's already saying it what's any need of him coming back right is that is that trying to make a doctrine or an idea no it's telling the truth we've got to be prepared for whatever God does and see that's what I've been doing for 40 years is trying to provide this church for a short ministry because I've always known what the Prophet says he said Jesus come to mount Transfiguration I mean unnoted from when I first read it he said he went straight to Calvary it's about six months difference between Mount of Transfiguration and Calvary and the Lord Jesus was heading towards his death and I've always said it because I've always believed this message if it don't take me and you to our death to our self then we're not in the message we're not in the message if it's not killed us I ain't meaning physically all right spiritually if that brought us to a place that we're dead to ourselves and walking in Christ then the message hadn't done us any good so you said brother down what do you expect in the message to do kill every one of us how many of you remember brother Fred Hooper you remember the Jim Jones situation that happened down there you know nothing and at that time they asked Fred don't work they said Fred said if Sam ever tried to get you to kill yourself he said everday that ever died all around he trying to get me to kill myself the work roschin live see that's what God's waiting on a church like that not the fact of you saying it I mean him saying you must say it let me find one in it then we'll quit okay well this is often the message adoption in in number 17 with with learners for expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation the manifestation what is the manifestation making known the whole world the Muhammadans are we under there looking for it the Muhammadans are looking for the sons and daughters of God yeah cuz the whole world is waiting right there looking for it where is there those people or where is these people excuse me where's the people he's looking for but we fail to hear looking at all of those things fell to hear this steal small boys I'm looking for one specific is groaning waiting the whole world is waiting he's just waiting waiting now with his long suffering that his coming already past due waiting to get the church in order so the Second Coming can take place waiting on the church to get the Second Coming to come to pass I'm trying to find one certain quote if God be in you all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured poured into the church so it's God above us God with us God in us we followed in a lot anything but listen and bring his people God kind of sending down making a way for me to get back and bring his people back to manifested sons of God like they had them in the manifestation of the sons you know in the Garden of Eden the whole world groaning waiting for that hour for the manifestation of sons of God he has no voice with our voice he has no hands with our hands he said I'm divine you're the branches I was looking for the one where he's talking about the Old Testament Saints but that's alright I'll find it can't even find something my own notes go ahead masseuse musicians coming here and I'll see if I can find that while you're coming cause I wanted to read down this is one I like Melchizedek the Great Prince number 11 when we're really when we rally dire with Abraham Isaac and Jacob those who were heirs of the promise looking forward to us not to fail you mean Abraham I don't know for without us they can not be made perfect looking for us not to fail you mean that all that happened down through there is gonna wind up with us sitting in church glory we're in the message we believe that everything we're ready for the Lord we just don't know what's holding it off I know what's holding it off me I know what's holding it off you no problem because when the bride gets ready God is ready why because he's waiting on God is waiting on you and off you don't get nothing out of the message they get that God is waiting on you and I too speak the word and go forth and did the probably preach a message coke why cry speak maybe you oughta try speaking sometimes come on may I quote the Prophet I draw the house in wild fire then no fire what I tried it one time they didn't work we'll go try it again I prayed about being sick didn't get well but that didn't stop me from praying the night Tom I gots it Church I'm just trying to get you and I for one time God's waiting on me and you the whole world's waiting on you and me and what are we doing dilly dallying around not studying not praying not seeking God well yet we're a yeah that's what used to tickle me you know people you hadn't seen him in a long time and you know what I'm talking about him and seeing people in a long time and they come up and you say well how you doing oh I'm doing wonderful that's one brother one time he said he'd left the church here and he said I said how you doing brother he said doing the best I've ever done well good then you know we going turf then oh I'm not going I don't go nowhere I said oh you all right you know and I said now I want to restate my question I said how you doing brother he didn't answer the first question like he didn't say I'm doing great he said brother to hell I'm in bad shape now he got serious now he'd got honest with his first statement oh I'm doing better I'm doing better I don't go to church or not but I'm of the Lord's with me you ever heard people say that the order been out here the other day when that woman was telling me in Terence how bad we was they had that little tent sitting right out there trying their best getting some of your houses or backyard now you say well brother Dale you're to help that lady I did we took her down to commerce and we give her two nights in the motel and gave her $200 to go on her way you said well you're too broad all right next time I'll bring her to your house that'll set it up you won't condemn me for what I do because the next time I'll bring her to your house I'm not joking I didn't want I told that lady yesterday we can't leave you setting out here but I said I can't do what you won't I see you're condemning me upside down with with all of these things you're saying that I'm not a Christian and a Christian would help other Christians and do good I said you want to condemn me you're doing a good job but I still can't do what you want so I can't call some of my people up and sound sinning this lady down there and let her put a tent up in the backyard goes like well I said you know for certain what it would be come on you would have somebody out in the backyard with a tent and it's raining like crazy you ain't gonna leave them out to her you gonna go get them in your house and about time you get them in the house you ain't gonna get them out you done fell for it that's what one brother I called him I said what about he's he I know the lady said but don't send her my way and said for heaven's sake don't let her in your house I said lady I can't open his church door and let you stay here that's what insurance won't cover I said I'm doing the best I can do lady I'm doing everything I've offered I told her I said you go you tell me where you want to go I'll take you to the bus depot and pay for your ticket to California to anywhere in the United States I said I'm not stupid I ain't sitting over the world well I'll send you anywhere you want to go well I don't have nowhere to go I said well you better find something cause we got to do something so we had to do it thank God for Terrance taking the parts of it and starting it off and then June help me end the life part of it I'm not joking Terrence started here at 9 o'clock in the morning with her in June and myself had her turn down at a motel that commerce at 7 o'clock so we spent all day with that lady trying our best to get her to go somewhere and let us put her up but there was no way what would you think if I caught us it hey this lady wants to set her tent up in your backyard he said well of course if you put me up in your backyard in time since you and I found the jobs that you'd have to take me to work that's a lady you're doing a good job condemning me I still ain't gonna do what you're asking you say well brother Dale you wrong we'll all right next time on center of your house we'll solve that problem I had two brothers one time you were every tell his people coming in and he priests say they've done a good job the preacher did what the two brothers didn't know what I knew because that brother had just left this man's house to come here to preach for us and he said nice thing he said he said saying those don't want gays home did that man has been in my house for three months no stuff he's been in my house three months I said thank you I'll take care of it so when he got through and it was mrs. snow you know I walked outside I

own them in your house three months I'll give them to me I said next time I'll send him home with you boy I ain't never had no problem since a nobody has made question my judgment I don't mean that wrong I just mean the truth we're Christians living here but we don't have to take care of that like that not when we would put somebody up in a motel to give it was no way in the world I was gonna leave that lady's right out there I mean there's no way I was gonna do it but what was I gonna do no so it took about eight hours to figure out how I was to do but you see Church we think we're Christians well you didn't act like a Christian because you took the lady would you done it oh you can say now yes I would but the next time I call you are you gonna be at home okay I'm making a lot
