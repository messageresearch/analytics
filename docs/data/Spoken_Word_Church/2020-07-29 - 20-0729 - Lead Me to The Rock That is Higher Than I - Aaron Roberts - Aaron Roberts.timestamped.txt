[20:28] and it seems like every day there's
[20:30] there's more believers that
[20:31] that uh keep contacting and posting that
[20:36] they are testing positive so a lot of
[20:39] them are
[20:39] really facing a lot of uh of these
[20:42] symptoms
[20:43] and uh especially you know it's a lot
[20:45] harder on the older ones
[20:46] and also some
[20:49] friends of mine
[20:53] you know it it's one thing
[20:56] for me when i was working
[21:00] and they cut our hours i got
[21:02] unemployment i got money from the
[21:03] federal government
[21:04] but if you are like i guess brother tony
[21:08] some of them that are
[21:09] self-employed but gary you know
[21:12] it's hard and i i've had some i've got a
[21:15] i got a friend and some other ones but i
[21:17] got one friend that
[21:18] lives in alabama and he's he's really
[21:20] struggled with this the last
[21:22] little while i'm trying to fight with
[21:23] the department of labor trying to get
[21:25] money because it's like hey it's not my
[21:27] fault you know
[21:28] and uh and especially you know
[21:31] he was able to get some money through a
[21:33] loan but then they're supposed to have
[21:34] loan forgiveness well
[21:36] uh it's really easy when they loan you
[21:39] money
[21:39] to forget what the terms are and and i
[21:42] was like
[21:43] you owe us money it's like no there's
[21:45] you got to follow the
[21:46] black and white here but so he's uh and
[21:48] then you call
[21:49] the department of labor and then uh they
[21:52] play elevator music for you
[21:55] and just please hold please hope he's
[21:57] over and so you can stay on hold till
[21:59] tomorrow
[22:00] and so y'all well let's just remember
[22:02] the different ones that are that are
[22:03] really struggling
[22:05] you know i mean it was hard on some
[22:07] people but it's still hard on
[22:08] others and you know the lord take care
[22:10] of his own
[22:12] and you know i mean not just message
[22:14] believers but i mean
[22:16] people that are real christian people
[22:18] that are trying to
[22:19] you know sincere and try to live for the
[22:21] lord and uh
[22:22] you know y'all just y'all just remember
[22:24] them because you know i think about it
[22:26] every day the lord blessed me i was able
[22:28] to have money and our bills got paid and
[22:30] everything but i don't know
[22:31] what it was like to you know if you're
[22:34] if you've got two incomes and all of a
[22:36] sudden
[22:36] you lose one and you know your wife his
[22:39] wife's work and trying to pay for
[22:41] everything and it just makes it hard
[22:43] trying to take care of the kids and
[22:44] everything so let's just remember all of
[22:46] them and
[22:47] but you know the lord knows all our
[22:49] needs before we ask but you know he said
[22:50] he said for us to ask he asked that your
[22:53] joy might be full
[22:56] and so you know it's a pleasure to ask
[22:57] him because he wants us to all right
[22:59] amen so before we read the scripture or
[23:01] not let's uh let's just all speak to the
[23:03] author and i know
[23:05] we speak to him but you know what
[23:06] brother brown said we can't pray enough
[23:09] you know we talk to a lot of people and
[23:11] we run our mouths and we have the gift
[23:12] of gab but there's one thing
[23:14] we can't do is talk to the lord amen

[26:42] thinking of
[26:43] of something and i couldn't really
[26:47] put it together into any anything but uh
[26:49] you know we went and seen uh we went to
[26:52] kentucky
[26:53] and and seen abraham lincoln's
[26:54] birthplace and everything then we went
[26:56] to springfield illinois where he grew up
[26:57] and
[26:59] and you know there's a lot of things
[27:00] about lincoln's life that's uh
[27:02] just really fascinating and it's just a
[27:05] real testimony of jesus christ and
[27:10] you know there was just some other
[27:11] things that happened just kind of
[27:13] dovetailing this morning i just
[27:15] had a little thought i wanted to speak
[27:17] on tonight so y'all just pray for me
[27:20] it says hear my cry oh lord attend unto
[27:23] my prayer from the end of the earth will
[27:25] i
[27:25] cry unto thee when my heart is
[27:27] overwhelmed
[27:28] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[27:30] i for thou hast been a shelter for me
[27:32] and a strong tower from the enemy
[27:35] i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i
[27:38] will trust in the covert
[27:40] of thy wings see life
[27:43] and then we go to first corinthians
[27:45] chapter 10 is the next reading
[27:48] and it says moreover brethren i would
[27:50] not
[27:51] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[27:54] our fathers were under the cloud
[27:56] and all pass through the sea and were
[27:58] all baptized unto moses in the cloud and
[28:00] in the sea
[28:01] and did eat and all eat the same
[28:04] spiritual meat
[28:06] and did drink all the same spiritual
[28:07] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[28:10] rock
[28:11] that followed them and that rock was
[28:13] christ but with many of them god was not
[28:16] well pleased
[28:17] for they were overthrown in the
[28:18] wilderness now these things were our
[28:21] examples to the end
[28:22] to the intent we should not lust after
[28:25] evil things as they also lusted
[28:27] neither be idolaters as were some of
[28:30] them
[28:31] as it is written the people sat down to
[28:32] eat and drink and rose up to play
[28:34] neither let us commit fornication as
[28:37] some of them committed
[28:38] and fell in one day three and twenty
[28:40] thousand neither let us tempt christ
[28:42] as some of them also tempted and were
[28:44] destroyed of serpents
[28:45] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[28:48] murmured and were destroyed of the
[28:49] destroyer
[28:51] now all these things happened unto them
[28:52] for our examples
[28:54] and they are written for our admonition
[28:56] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[28:58] wherefore letter
[28:59] let him that think as he standeth take
[29:01] heed lest he fall
[29:04] there hath no temptation taking you but
[29:06] such is common to man
[29:08] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[29:10] you to be tempted above
[29:12] that which you are able but will
[29:15] with the temptation also make a way of
[29:17] escape
[29:18] that you may be able to to bear it amen
[29:21] god bless you tonight
[29:22] be seated and
[29:32] i uh
[29:36] think of them you know we have a
[29:40] have a rock and david's speaking of
[29:44] he said when my heart is overwhelmed he
[29:46] said lead me to the rock that is higher
[29:48] than i
[29:49] and you know we're living in a time
[29:50] where a lot of people are overwhelmed
[29:52] with a lot of things
[29:54] and you know you you see that you see
[29:56] the condition
[29:57] that the world is in today and and
[30:00] you know you you can't
[30:06] you can't play with god and you can't
[30:09] play in in this area because you know
[30:11] now this is
[30:12] this is the time of manifesting and this
[30:15] is the time where it's going to be made
[30:17] known
[30:18] and you know this is the hour you've got
[30:20] to have the goods
[30:21] you've got you've got to have you've got
[30:23] to have the life you've got to have
[30:26] you've got to have the holy ghost
[30:28] because you just can't play with
[30:31] in this in this hour because you know
[30:32] there's many people that you see
[30:34] and you know i was thinking about as
[30:38] brother ernie villanueva always says
[30:40] we're living in a ripley's believe it or
[30:42] not world because we we live in such a
[30:44] time that is so
[30:47] mind-boggling to see the condition that
[30:50] the world is in
[30:51] and to see what what people have done
[30:54] and what people consider
[30:55] normal and and you know we see all these
[30:57] things that are taking place today
[30:59] and you know you you need to know where
[31:02] you stand
[31:03] you've got to have the play you know
[31:05] where you've got to where you need to be
[31:07] and you know because hearing and paul's
[31:09] speaking to the corinthians and he's
[31:11] and he's speaking to these things and
[31:13] and he says brothers i don't want you to
[31:15] be ignorant of this because he said you
[31:17] know
[31:17] some of them understood these things
[31:19] they they knew that they knew the
[31:21] history they knew what took place
[31:23] but he said i want to drill down on
[31:25] something i want you to have
[31:26] emphasis on this he said because he said
[31:28] i want you ignorant of this he said
[31:30] because well they all they all knew that
[31:32] moses
[31:33] god called moses to to lead the children
[31:35] of israel and they had a pillar of fire
[31:37] at night in a cloud by day
[31:39] but you know and he said but he said i
[31:40] want you to see this he said
[31:42] all of these that walked with moses he
[31:44] said they walked through
[31:46] with moses moses led them through and
[31:48] they had all these things
[31:50] and he said he said they ate of this
[31:51] spiritual meat and he said they drank of
[31:53] this rock
[31:54] he said they had this rock that followed
[31:56] them through the wilderness
[31:58] and he said and that rock was christ and
[32:00] he said i want you to understand he said
[32:02] christ was with them the whole time it
[32:04] was grace to them
[32:05] that there was a there was a pillar of
[32:07] fire there was a prophet in their day
[32:09] and all these things that they took
[32:10] place
[32:11] he said it was grace to them but he said
[32:13] they didn't pay attention to that
[32:15] and he said and all this and he said and
[32:16] look he said they went all those
[32:18] all these things that god done for them
[32:20] and leading them the whole way
[32:21] and he said but look he said but god was
[32:23] not well pleased with them
[32:25] why because they didn't have faith in
[32:26] what and what he's
[32:28] and what he said and what he was doing
[32:30] for them and you know
[32:31] brother brennam uh in in the message
[32:35] uh spiritual do uh spiritual food and
[32:38] due
[32:38] season you know brother brennan when
[32:40] he's when he begins to speak here he
[32:42] says
[32:42] he said i want you to to get built up in
[32:45] this
[32:46] he said in the holy oracles of god and
[32:48] the faith
[32:49] the faith of this hour the faith it's
[32:52] going to take more faith than ever
[32:54] was in any age for this for this has to
[32:58] be rapturing faith to be taken up
[33:00] and he said we won't we want to want you
[33:03] to believe tonight
[33:04] in all that you have seen heard the word
[33:07] that you have heard
[33:08] preached the signs and wonders that you
[33:10] have seen done we want you to accumulate
[33:13] all that together in your heart and
[33:14] consider it whether it
[33:16] be of god or not
[33:20] so they brought it up but uh
[33:23] when you when you speak he's speaking of
[33:25] having faith
[33:26] and you know paul's speaking he said
[33:28] they didn't have faith but all these
[33:30] things that they done he said this was
[33:31] for our example
[33:33] here they were being led and being by a
[33:36] promised word to a promised place
[33:38] a promised destination that god had told
[33:41] them
[33:42] told their forefathers years before told
[33:44] abraham and all the different ones that
[33:46] here they are they're going to be
[33:47] brought through
[33:47] all these things and yet they did not
[33:49] have faith to believe what was going to
[33:51] take place
[33:52] and all the times that god met their
[33:53] needs when they didn't have food
[33:55] he fed them when they didn't have water
[33:57] he he gave them water
[33:58] he gave them everything that they have
[34:00] needed no there wasn't a feeble one
[34:02] among them
[34:03] and and all the things that took place
[34:04] that god had done for them and yet
[34:06] they didn't have faith to believe what
[34:08] god was going to do for them
[34:09] and all the things that god had done and
[34:11] led them through they didn't see it and
[34:13] then and then he begins to tell us
[34:14] you know not to be idolaters or commit
[34:17] fornication
[34:18] or temp god all these different things
[34:20] that people can do
[34:21] he said don't do any of these things
[34:23] because you see what they've done in the
[34:25] past
[34:25] god doesn't want us to fall fall victim
[34:28] to all these things but he said he wants
[34:30] us to have
[34:30] faith in what he's done because it's a
[34:33] finished work
[34:34] at calvary but god wants us to believe
[34:36] in that and walk in that
[34:37] amen we need to we need to and brother
[34:40] branham said one time
[34:41] he was he was speaking he said he said
[34:43] it's time for us to go
[34:45] to the rock go to that the rock is
[34:47] christ he said he said because david was
[34:49] saying he said
[34:50] when i'm overwhelmed he said there's one
[34:52] place for me to go he said is go to the
[34:54] rock
[34:55] he said because thou has been a shelter
[34:57] for me and a strong tower from the enemy
[35:00] he said they know what god had done for
[35:02] him and it was a place for him to go to
[35:04] and there's a place for you and i to go
[35:06] to and that's in the rock of jesus
[35:08] christ
[35:08] [Music]
[35:10] the jesus that rock is a revelation of
[35:12] jesus christ
[35:15] and god wants to reveal himself to you
[35:17] in a in a personal way
[35:19] greater than you have today you think
[35:21] well you know i have a
[35:22] i have a revelation god has spoke to me
[35:24] i know what god has revealed to me but
[35:26] you know what there is a greater
[35:27] a greater revelation that god has for
[35:29] you a higher place than
[35:31] than you are today he said lead me to
[35:33] that rock that revelation that is higher
[35:35] than i am
[35:36] right now because there is a place that
[35:38] god is calling us to
[35:39] and he said we need to have a greater
[35:41] revelation a greater faith today because
[35:43] we are the group that's
[35:45] going to be raptured out of here
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] yes sir
[35:51] amen god has
[35:56] allowed us to live in the closing hours
[35:59] of the gentile dispensation and we
[36:01] and you see what god has called us to
[36:04] you know there's many people that's been
[36:06] through the
[36:07] through the bible all the different ones
[36:09] that the uh
[36:11] all the prophets and the different ones
[36:12] you know they desire to see our day what
[36:14] a great
[36:15] hour and a great day that we live in
[36:17] this great day
[36:18] and you know what we don't realize that
[36:19] we are the ones that's going to bring
[36:20] the culmination to this
[36:23] you know all the ones we look back at at
[36:25] the great heroes of faith
[36:27] and we talk about you know all the ones
[36:29] that
[36:30] we go back and look through the
[36:31] scripture in hebrews and we talk about
[36:33] moses and abraham and
[36:35] and joseph and and all the great uh ones
[36:38] of the bible all the
[36:39] all the prophets and everything like
[36:41] that you know and they were all speaking
[36:42] about
[36:43] us we're the ones that they were looking
[36:45] to us to finish this
[36:47] you know what what a great opportunity
[36:49] we have what an awesome responsibility
[36:51] that we have
[36:52] that god wants us to come to this place
[36:54] that we can finish
[36:55] this god didn't god didn't call you know
[36:57] as brother branham said you know if god
[36:59] asked me if i could live in any time in
[37:01] the world he said i'd want to live in
[37:02] this day
[37:04] and this is the day that god caught you
[37:06] and i to live in and here is the time
[37:08] that we
[37:09] that we can live that we can manifest
[37:11] who jesus christ
[37:12] is in this day to the to a lost and
[37:15] dying world
[37:16] you know because there's a lot of people
[37:18] out there they're looking they're
[37:19] looking
[37:19] for jesus christ they're looking for a
[37:22] genuine christian
[37:24] you know there's a lot of people in the
[37:26] world they know they are professors but
[37:28] there's no possessors
[37:29] there's many people that can get up and
[37:31] talk a lot and they
[37:32] and they know the scripture but the
[37:34] problem is is they don't know the author
[37:36] they have no idea who the author is and
[37:38] they don't know it because they know it
[37:40] by the letter but they don't know it by
[37:41] the spirit
[37:42] and the spirit and the letter kills them
[37:44] and they are dead
[37:46] and and you know as as jack coe said
[37:48] that time he said
[37:49] churches want to get together and he
[37:51] said they want to have chicken and ice
[37:53] cream and
[37:54] and tea and he said the problem is he
[37:56] said the chair
[37:57] the churches are as dead as the chicken
[38:00] they're as cold as the ice cream and
[38:02] they're as weak as the t
[38:06] and he said that's the whole problem he
[38:08] said because why god
[38:09] is trying to find somebody that will
[38:11] actually take him at his word
[38:13] and prove to the world that there is
[38:16] there is one standing upon the earth
[38:18] that is going to fulfill exactly what
[38:20] this scripture says
[38:21] you know there's many people that you
[38:23] meet and and they're and they're good
[38:24] people and man they can talk to this
[38:26] they can talk to you about the
[38:27] scriptures
[38:27] but the problem is is they don't believe
[38:30] it know there was a man
[38:32] that was talking and and it just blows
[38:35] my mind you know
[38:36] because i was listening to this man
[38:39] and he was and he was talking about uh
[38:42] having miracles i was like well if we
[38:45] don't if you don't believe that
[38:46] that god still does miracles then we
[38:48] need to turn tear out hebrews 13 and 8
[38:50] we need to tear out
[38:51] corinthians and all the different places
[38:53] why because if he still don't if he
[38:55] doesn't doing miracles anymore he only
[38:57] done that when the apostles were here
[38:58] well then guess what then all the way
[39:00] through
[39:00] church history from the time of paul
[39:03] irenaeus
[39:04] martin all the different ones all the
[39:06] john wesley all the different ones
[39:08] that done miracles all the way through
[39:09] the scripture then we need to take
[39:11] all of them out and write them off
[39:12] because none of that happened
[39:15] because all you look at you look at
[39:18] moody
[39:18] and and sankey and spurgeon and all the
[39:20] different ones and and
[39:21] that were minister that preached all the
[39:23] way down through history and all the
[39:25] things that god done in their
[39:26] in their lives if we don't see that god
[39:28] was still doing miracles
[39:30] he only done that for the apostles well
[39:31] then you know what the rest of the early
[39:33] church
[39:34] and all the way down through time then
[39:36] you know we need to write all of them
[39:37] off because they were all heretics
[39:39] because they didn't fulfill any of that
[39:41] because you know what if he's still not
[39:43] the same
[39:43] yesterday today and forever then we need
[39:45] to find somebody else because
[39:47] you know what then we just need to take
[39:49] our bibles and throw them in the trash
[39:50] can because it's not even worth
[39:52] the paper that it's printed on but you
[39:54] know god wants somebody because you know
[39:56] you're looking you know they talk about
[39:58] divine healing and all these different
[39:59] things you know
[40:01] god is a saying if it's written in the
[40:03] scripture right here
[40:04] you should i can tell you where i can
[40:05] show you where he put it in the
[40:07] scripture
[40:08] and he called for the church the bride
[40:10] to fulfill the and do these things we
[40:12] have
[40:12] he said the works that i do shall you do
[40:14] also and greater works than these
[40:17] he said so because i go to my father
[40:19] well he said i can show you where he put
[40:20] it in the scripture you tell me where he
[40:22] took it out
[40:26] why because he's the same yesterday
[40:27] today and forever
[40:30] well because this well paul said that he
[40:32] put the but he put the gifts in the
[40:34] scripture
[40:36] that he put the gifts in for the
[40:38] perfecting of the of the body
[40:39] that this all works together and then he
[40:41] and then and then people you know they
[40:43] don't even believe in you know
[40:44] uh if you talk about a a prophet
[40:48] well you know it well then we need to
[40:50] take that out because ephesians 4 is
[40:51] wrong because you know there's prophets
[40:54] the bible talks about prophets so what
[40:55] you talk about some people you talk
[40:57] about a prophet people just get all
[40:58] nervous you know
[40:59] they're you know they don't know what
[41:03] what you're talking about well you know
[41:06] the thing is is
[41:07] people have gotten to the place now
[41:08] where they just can't actually just sit
[41:10] down
[41:10] and wait for and just look at what the
[41:12] scripture says in black and white
[41:14] and and just pray to the lord comes and
[41:16] speaks to you
[41:22] you know what brother brandon said one
[41:23] time when he's talking about
[41:26] when he was talking about people getting
[41:28] in the scripture and reading what the
[41:29] scripture has to say
[41:30] and he said he said now if you run
[41:32] across something he said no you're
[41:34] talking about him preaching brother
[41:35] around preaching and you're listening to
[41:36] one of his tapes
[41:37] and he said now listen he said stop the
[41:39] tape
[41:40] and take it to the bible and read the
[41:42] scripture and say and study it out
[41:48] and so look in the scripture does it not
[41:50] say these things
[41:52] so then so if he the things that he done
[41:55] and and and then the what he calls the
[41:57] apostles to do what he called them to do
[42:00] is the same commission that he give us
[42:04] it's the same commission that we're
[42:05] given the same commission that they had
[42:08] so when when we get together you know
[42:10] then we can then we can call for the
[42:12] elders
[42:13] and anoint people with all and they will
[42:15] get healed
[42:16] you know we can we can call for those
[42:17] things you know you don't have to have
[42:19] be a preacher
[42:21] you don't have to be anybody all you got
[42:23] to be is a born-again son or a daughter
[42:24] of god
[42:25] and have faith in what you believe and
[42:26] realize that's your commission
[42:28] god told you you could do that you could
[42:30] call for the things that you have need
[42:32] of and believe that god will do it
[42:34] that's it if you have if you have a need
[42:37] if it's in your body if it's financial
[42:39] whatever it is if you have lost children
[42:41] whatever it is
[42:42] then you can call for it you have the
[42:45] ability to speak the word
[42:48] but people people you know but people
[42:50] get so scared and they
[42:52] and they kind of get likes about it
[42:53] because you know the devil just allows
[42:56] things to wash over people and push them
[42:58] around
[43:00] but you don't realize you know when
[43:01] things things like that happen in our
[43:03] lives
[43:03] god is trying to bring us back to the
[43:05] place that he wants us to be
[43:07] as david said when i'm overwhelmed when
[43:10] i'm pushed around when i'm
[43:12] tossed about when i'm on this
[43:14] life-sinking sand or when i'm in this
[43:16] ship that's tossing me to and fro
[43:18] he said there is a rock that i can go to
[43:21] there's a place for me to go to
[43:28] you know many people have
[43:32] you know they just kind of get lacks and
[43:35] and you know they
[43:37] and and it doesn't make them bad people
[43:39] it's just that some people you know they
[43:40] just don't realize where they're at and
[43:42] the danger
[43:43] that that this hour has and people don't
[43:46] realize
[43:46] how how we need to be fervent and what
[43:49] we're doing we have to have to always be
[43:51] on guard
[43:51] and many people have become likes about
[43:53] things and you know and
[43:55] you know and you see the you see all of
[43:57] these things that have washed in
[43:59] and draw people around and people get
[44:01] nervous about things that people don't
[44:03] know where they're standing
[44:04] and it just shows the hour in which we
[44:06] live because people don't have what they
[44:08] think they have
[44:09] you need to have what you what what the
[44:11] bible says and if you don't it's the
[44:13] time to be checking up and it's time to
[44:14] be praying through
[44:15] to get what you have need of
[44:19] you know because we've had many people
[44:20] that have come in and they and they've
[44:22] they've walked around this message and
[44:24] and and you know they've
[44:26] preached this message for years and all
[44:28] of a sudden you know we've seen this max
[44:30] mass exodus that have all these people
[44:32] that have left the message and went
[44:34] and all and their whole goal and their
[44:36] whole
[44:37] thing that they live for in this world
[44:39] is to tear this message down
[44:41] and all they're trying to do is plant
[44:43] seeds of doubt in people's minds
[44:45] and trying to get people wishy-washy and
[44:48] and you know trying to
[44:49] trying to tear up churches and all kinds
[44:50] of different things that has nothing to
[44:52] do but see the thing is
[44:53] it doesn't matter if you know where
[44:55] you're standing if you're in the rock of
[44:57] revelation of jesus christ he said upon
[44:59] this rock i'll build my church well you
[45:01] know what if you have that
[45:02] he said the gates of hell shall not
[45:04] prevail against it it doesn't matter how
[45:06] much
[45:07] seeds of doubt people try to try to sow
[45:09] you know what i know where i stand and i
[45:11] know what what god has shown me
[45:13] and it doesn't matter there's not enough
[45:14] devils in hell that's trying to
[45:16] that's going to drive me away from it
[45:19] but you've got to come to that place
[45:20] because people you know because if you
[45:22] start to have
[45:23] a doubt or you and it's not wrong to
[45:25] have questions
[45:26] the problem is is people allow those
[45:29] things to overtake
[45:30] them it's because you know you've got to
[45:32] come to a born-again experience
[45:34] that you know that you know that you
[45:36] know you've got to have a typos that
[45:37] you're tied to
[45:38] that you know exactly what god's done
[45:40] for you
[45:44] because if you've got if you've got the
[45:46] one that's wrote this scripture
[45:47] then you know what he's going to lead
[45:49] you and guide you through it
[45:54] but many people
[45:57] and i i hate to say that but you know
[46:00] there's a number of people that that
[46:01] have gathered around
[46:02] and you know they still don't know where
[46:03] they stand and you know and and and the
[46:05] other thing is is this
[46:06] there's there's no need there absolutely
[46:10] no need to listen to that
[46:14] absolutely i mean you know you know i
[46:16] don't i don't
[46:17] i i don't i don't agree with the
[46:19] catholic church there's no need of me
[46:21] listening to mass
[46:24] i don't i don't listen i don't listen to
[46:26] you know all these different teachers
[46:28] and
[46:28] and different ones and you know i i've
[46:30] i've listened to enough of them just to
[46:32] you know every now and then to hear
[46:34] things that that people have said
[46:35] but you know you know if you don't agree
[46:37] with it then there's no need to try to
[46:39] listen to it
[46:42] you know if it's not a faith if it's not
[46:44] of god then you know what there's no
[46:45] need to listen to
[46:46] don't even don't even entertain it it's
[46:48] just time to put it aside
[46:51] and you know all these people want to
[46:52] start arguments you know it doesn't
[46:54] matter you can you can tell them
[46:56] everybody's got their arguments about
[46:58] things in the message and you know what
[47:00] that's fine but you know you can you can
[47:03] talk to your blue in the face
[47:06] and it don't matter you ain't going to
[47:07] change their mind and you know what they
[47:09] ain't going to change yours and all
[47:10] you're doing is wasting your time
[47:12] trying to argue with somebody they're
[47:15] they're ain't they
[47:16] that's all they want that's all they
[47:17] want is find somebody that they can poke
[47:20] and prod and just you know irritate and
[47:22] agitate somebody
[47:24] you know it's time to listen brother i
[47:25] don't i don't have time for this you
[47:27] know i'm going to tell you what brother
[47:28] branham said this is what's in the
[47:30] scripture
[47:30] you know if you if you don't agree with
[47:32] it that's fine i mean you go on and do
[47:34] your thing
[47:34] and i'm going to do mine but there ain't
[47:36] no me of me and you trying to argue and
[47:38] fuss about it
[47:41] you know uh i'm gonna i want to share a
[47:45] story with you
[47:46] if you if you don't mind uh uh
[47:50] you know there was a a man you know
[47:53] y'all might find this interesting uh one
[47:56] of one of the things
[47:58] studying on abraham lincoln's life uh
[48:02] do y'all know who one of uh abraham
[48:04] lincoln's most
[48:05] uh well i wouldn't say the most
[48:08] favorite but he uh a political opponent
[48:11] that he faced
[48:12] more than once in his political career
[48:14] was a man by the name of peter
[48:15] cartwright
[48:17] if y'all know if y'all know who peter
[48:19] cartwright is he's the
[48:20] evangelist the uh circuit riding
[48:24] preacher that brother man talks about
[48:26] that you know he was in that saloon that
[48:27] time and he was washing the windows and
[48:29] the man told him said hey you can't have
[48:31] service here and he said
[48:32] he said well the lord told me to he said
[48:34] well if you if you're going to have
[48:35] service here
[48:36] he said you got to whip me and he said
[48:38] well that's just the next thing that
[48:39] i'll do
[48:40] and peter cartwright jumped on him and
[48:42] you know just about beat him up and then
[48:44] he
[48:44] you know he told him he's like you know
[48:45] if you you had enough and and
[48:48] you know he said the next you know he
[48:49] said the night this night or whatever
[48:50] when the
[48:51] when they had church so he said that man
[48:53] came in and got saved
[48:55] but you know here here was a here was a
[48:57] and i wanted to tell you that you know
[48:59] lincoln and peter cartwright they uh
[49:02] he had he had him uh they both ran for
[49:05] the illinois
[49:06] uh legislature they also ran against
[49:08] each other for congress
[49:10] and you know it was so amazing to read
[49:12] about these two men it's like well you
[49:13] know
[49:14] you can't find you can't find men like
[49:15] that actually run for
[49:17] uh political office nowadays that you
[49:19] know actually had men that had
[49:20] convictions and
[49:22] and those things but you hear these two
[49:23] men that are
[49:25] from different political parties and had
[49:27] different ideas about things even had
[49:30] differences about religion and you know
[49:32] there was lots of times that you know
[49:33] they
[49:33] uh had had uh argued about different
[49:37] things and
[49:38] not as far as arguing but more like
[49:40] debating things and
[49:41] you know and as they went along you know
[49:43] they had differences and all these
[49:44] different things
[49:45] but you know there was one thing that uh
[49:48] i thought was really good was
[49:49] um all the way through there through his
[49:52] life and i think
[49:54] peter cartwright was about 25 years
[49:55] older than lincoln but anyway uh
[49:57] as he as he got older and you know he
[50:00] uh when lincoln became president
[50:04] later on in life he was there and uh
[50:08] there was an occasion at a uh conference
[50:11] it was a gathering and a lot of people
[50:14] had got up and they were
[50:15] it was in the it was in new york and
[50:16] they had really been critical of lincoln
[50:19] and uh they had really just raked him
[50:21] over the coals
[50:22] and peter cartwright got up and and he
[50:25] told him you know
[50:26] he said he said he said i had this man
[50:29] as a political opponent and he said
[50:33] he said i i lost him he said we both ran
[50:36] for a seat in congress he said
[50:38] he said when it came to the ballot box
[50:39] he said i went down in defeat
[50:42] but he said i want you to know one thing
[50:44] he said i went down to the feet
[50:46] to a gentleman and a patriot
[50:50] yeah and he told him he said y'all all
[50:53] here and y'all all have negative things
[50:55] to say about
[50:56] lincoln but he said i want you to say i
[50:59] want you to know one thing
[51:00] he said we have the men in office
[51:04] to lead our country through this crisis
[51:08] and you know he talked about the kind of
[51:11] he said because he has a he has a
[51:12] god-fearing love for his countrymen and
[51:15] he has and has the
[51:17] cool-headedness and he goes through and
[51:18] he talks about all the other things
[51:20] about
[51:20] the life of of president lincoln why
[51:23] because he went through all these things
[51:24] and he said even though the different oh
[51:26] they had you know differences in and
[51:28] different things and you know they had
[51:30] argued and you know they had bad
[51:32] feelings against each other
[51:33] but you know what he said in the end he
[51:35] said they they never lost their respect
[51:37] they never lost their love for one
[51:38] another
[51:39] and he said even in the end he said
[51:41] because of the
[51:42] of the of the life that that he said
[51:44] because of the integrity that
[51:46] that president lincoln had through his
[51:48] life you know he he stood up
[51:50] to them those men and he told them what
[51:52] kind of what kind of men that they were
[51:54] that
[51:54] he said here's a man that has stood up
[51:56] and and he he's lived the life
[51:58] and he said you know y'all can say
[51:59] whatever you want to but he said here's
[52:00] a man
[52:01] that has come and he said we have the
[52:02] man that will lead this country through
[52:05] and you know that's the thing it doesn't
[52:06] matter how much you can argue and
[52:07] disagree with people
[52:09] he said but don't ever lose your love
[52:10] for each other he said he said no matter
[52:12] how much you disagree with somebody
[52:14] he said have love brother man said he
[52:16] said you know he said no matter how much
[52:17] i
[52:18] disagree one end from the other from he
[52:20] said if i don't have the same love that
[52:22] i did in the beginning
[52:24] he said then i need to come to the altar
[52:25] he said because i should never lose my
[52:27] love for somebody
[52:28] over things like that and it was really
[52:30] it was really touching
[52:31] to understand how these how these two
[52:33] brothers you know and
[52:34] and seeing the kind of life that they
[52:36] had went through and all the different
[52:37] things and through politics and all the
[52:39] different things
[52:40] but you know what they still admired one
[52:41] another and you know
[52:43] they never lost that from each other and
[52:45] you know and it doesn't matter all the
[52:47] you know people
[52:47] people can disagree with you and people
[52:49] can walk away and all those type things
[52:51] and you know
[52:52] i'm not i'm not the of the kind that i'm
[52:54] just going to write people off you know
[52:55] just because somebody turns down this
[52:57] message you know that's up between them
[52:58] and god i'm not
[52:59] i'm not i'm not somebody that you know
[53:01] i'm not going to walk around and have
[53:02] them under my foot
[53:03] and you know always going to you know as
[53:06] so many other people have done
[53:07] you know they they because you you got
[53:09] to realize you know
[53:10] your words are a c that you're planning
[53:13] and you know
[53:13] the things that you do the things that
[53:15] you say is is
[53:17] is show the life that you live it shows
[53:20] it's a demonstration of the life of
[53:21] jesus christ
[53:22] it's it's your testimony
[53:28] god help us that we never get into a
[53:30] place that we can't
[53:32] love you know i you know i i don't have
[53:36] i don't have hard feelings against
[53:38] people you know because they just do
[53:40] their own thing but i'm going to do my
[53:41] thing
[53:42] i'm going to do what god wants me to do
[53:44] i'm going to live my life
[53:47] i don't i don't want to be so hard on
[53:49] people and
[53:50] but i want to do what god wants us to do
[54:00] second this is uh second corinthians
[54:03] chapter four
[54:09] verse 3 and it says but if our gospel be
[54:12] hid
[54:14] it is head to them that are lost in whom
[54:16] the god of this world has blinded the
[54:17] minds of them
[54:18] which believe not lest the light of this
[54:20] glorious gospel of christ
[54:22] who is the image of god should shine on
[54:24] them for we preach not ourselves but
[54:26] christ jesus the lord
[54:28] and ourselves your servants
[54:32] for jesus sake for god who commanded the
[54:35] light to shine out the darkness has
[54:36] shined
[54:37] in our hearts to give the light of the
[54:39] knowledge of the glory of god in the
[54:40] face of jesus christ
[54:42] but we have this treasure in earth and
[54:44] vessels that the excellency
[54:46] of the power may be of god and not of us
[54:49] he says we are troubled on every side
[54:51] yet not distressed
[54:53] we are perplexed but not in despair
[54:56] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[54:58] but not destroyed
[55:00] always bearing about in the body the
[55:02] dying of the lord jesus
[55:04] that the life also of jesus might be
[55:07] made manifest in our body
[55:09] for we which live are always always
[55:12] delivered
[55:12] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[55:15] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[55:17] our mortal flesh
[55:19] so then death worketh in us but life in
[55:21] you
[55:22] we having the same spirit of faith
[55:24] according as it is written i believed
[55:26] and therefore
[55:27] have i spoken we also believe and
[55:29] therefore speak
[55:31] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[55:34] jesus
[55:34] shall raise up us also by jesus
[55:38] and shall present us with you for all
[55:41] things are for your sakes that the
[55:42] abundant grace might
[55:44] through the thanksgiving of many abound
[55:46] for the glory of god
[55:48] for which calls we faint not but though
[55:51] our outward man perish yet the inward
[55:53] man
[55:53] is renewed day by day for our light
[55:55] affliction which is but for a moment
[55:58] worketh for us a far
[55:59] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[56:01] glory
[56:02] while we look not at the things which
[56:04] are seen but at the things
[56:06] which are not seen for the things which
[56:08] are seen are temporal
[56:09] but the things which are not seen are
[56:12] eternal
[56:14] amen so
[56:21] you know we if those that have
[56:24] that have been blinded by this by the by
[56:27] the word you know then
[56:28] it's to them but it's it's a glorious
[56:31] light for us
[56:32] and then you know we can we walk because
[56:34] god calls us to the light
[56:36] you know it's it's the grace of god that
[56:38] has brought us to this
[56:40] and you know you know you can you can
[56:41] only share the light with somebody but
[56:44] you know brother branham said you know
[56:45] if somebody is just like that man that
[56:47] he decides you know that you know he
[56:49] don't believe in the sun anymore and you
[56:51] know he don't want
[56:51] he don't want to stand in the sunlight
[56:53] he goes down in the basement he's
[56:54] gets in the basement and he stays and
[56:56] he's in total darkness down there and he
[56:58] don't want to
[56:59] realize that and he doesn't believe that
[57:01] there's a son out there and he wants to
[57:02] be all hidden
[57:03] in this in this little cramp corner you
[57:06] know and hide from everything well then
[57:07] you know that's
[57:08] that's what he does you can't you can't
[57:10] change his mind you can't
[57:11] force him to to recognize what's going
[57:14] on but you can tell him about it you can
[57:16] shine the light but you know you can't
[57:17] make them walk in it
[57:18] you can't you can't make them accept it
[57:20] and you know there's many people that
[57:21] that have received
[57:22] the light and you know it's just like
[57:24] you know a medicine you know if you
[57:26] you can have the medicine but if you
[57:27] don't take the medicine
[57:29] you know many people many people have
[57:31] walked around and
[57:32] you know it you know they they walk
[57:34] around and they and they have a
[57:36] prescription
[57:38] you can have you can have a prescription
[57:39] in your hand and say well you know i got
[57:41] i got what i need right here but you
[57:43] know what it takes more than just having
[57:45] that prescription in your hand you know
[57:48] it's just like saying well i'm gonna get
[57:49] full because i got a cookbook
[57:51] i got a cookbook right here you know i
[57:53] just got a cookbook like you know but
[57:55] that's not going to feed you
[57:57] you can you can have all you can talk
[57:59] about all about the things you know and
[58:01] see
[58:01] all these great pictures of all this
[58:03] great food but you know what they don't
[58:04] put a single calorie in your body
[58:06] and you can have you can have this great
[58:08] all this stuff about this medicine and
[58:10] have it
[58:10] and like brother branham said you have
[58:12] just like that man standing up sitting
[58:13] on the
[58:14] doctor's doorstep and die because he's
[58:16] right there at it and you know you give
[58:18] him the medicine but he don't take it
[58:20] you you can have the everything but you
[58:22] know you've got to do something with it
[58:23] so if you've been given the prescription
[58:26] that for whatever you have need of
[58:28] here's the prescription god has wrote it
[58:30] in his bible well then you've got to do
[58:31] something with that prescription
[58:33] there's a place to take that
[58:34] prescription because it has to be full
[58:37] to has to be filled and so you know god
[58:40] wants you to bring him the word and show
[58:42] him the lord this is what you said and
[58:43] that's what i claim that's what i want
[58:45] that's what i have need of
[58:46] then say lord this is so i'm gonna stay
[58:48] right here till i get what i have need
[58:50] of
[58:51] you know just like as uh jesus talked
[58:53] about the
[58:54] the woman and the unjust judge you know
[58:56] she just stayed there
[58:57] until she got what she wanted and just
[58:59] you know he just thought about oh this
[59:01] woman she's just driving me crazy
[59:03] all the time just continually being
[59:05] there well you know what people
[59:06] you know they they start down this road
[59:08] and they go and then all of a sudden
[59:09] it's like well maybe the lord don't want
[59:11] me to have it
[59:12] well you know what your your deliverance
[59:14] or whatever you have need of it just may
[59:16] be right in front of you but you decide
[59:18] that you're gonna
[59:19] you're gonna quit or i'm just gonna let
[59:22] up off the gas a little bit or i'm just
[59:23] thinking i'm just gonna coast or you
[59:25] know
[59:25] i'm just gonna just take a day off or
[59:27] you know i'm gonna wait you know just to
[59:29] see what's gonna happen
[59:30] no if you've got this desire if you've
[59:32] got this fervency then you got to stay
[59:33] with
[59:34] it all the time until you get exactly
[59:36] what you have need of you got to stay
[59:37] with it
[59:38] you got to pursue it and keep going
[59:40] that's right
[59:42] don't give up many people have
[59:50] you know because you know and and so if
[59:52] you if you just
[59:53] you start to give up and you know
[59:55] brother said
[59:56] sight and time is is the two biggest
[59:58] hindrance to god because people get to
[1:00:00] this place
[1:00:00] and you know they get so hung up and
[1:00:02] then they say well you know maybe that's
[1:00:03] not for me or
[1:00:04] you know they see their surroundings no
[1:00:06] we don't look at none of that
[1:00:08] we don't look at those things we look at
[1:00:10] things that are eternal
[1:00:13] paul said you know the things that are
[1:00:14] around us they're temporal we don't look
[1:00:16] at our we don't look at our situations
[1:00:18] we don't look at the things that are
[1:00:19] around us we need to look at what god
[1:00:20] said we need to look at
[1:00:22] the things that god said because if if
[1:00:24] he done it for one then he'll do it
[1:00:26] again
[1:00:26] if he's done it for one that's right
[1:00:29] if if he's ever done it then you know we
[1:00:32] don't have to worry about whether god's
[1:00:33] gonna heal somebody why because he's
[1:00:35] already healed you
[1:00:36] if he was standing here tonight he
[1:00:37] couldn't heal you because he's already
[1:00:39] done it
[1:00:39] if he's gonna save somebody he can't
[1:00:41] save him because he's already done it
[1:00:43] if he's going to fill anybody with the
[1:00:44] holy ghost he's already done it the
[1:00:46] thing is is whether you decide that
[1:00:47] you're going to accept it or not
[1:00:49] are you going to make a way for god to
[1:00:50] give you exactly what you have need of
[1:00:53] amen that's just like just like brother
[1:00:55] wade trying to go out and deliver mail
[1:00:57] to somebody and they ain't got a mailbox
[1:00:59] where was they gonna put the mail if you
[1:01:01] go if you expect mail then you know what
[1:01:02] you need to go buy a mailbox and put it
[1:01:04] up
[1:01:04] so the man can bring the mail to you
[1:01:08] you need do you need to have something
[1:01:09] where because you know there's a way
[1:01:11] there is an order for these things to
[1:01:12] take place well you know what if you
[1:01:14] don't do those
[1:01:14] things in order then how are you
[1:01:16] supposed to get what you have need of
[1:01:20] because if you don't if you don't go out
[1:01:22] and every single day we don't
[1:01:23] we don't pray and we don't study and we
[1:01:25] don't we don't show ourselves approved
[1:01:27] and we don't
[1:01:28] spend time waiting on god to speak to us
[1:01:30] because many times you know
[1:01:31] people think prayer is just talking to
[1:01:33] god well prayer's not talking to god
[1:01:35] it's let him talk to you
[1:01:39] you know many times brother always talks
[1:01:41] about you know when you get woke up
[1:01:42] early in the morning well lots of times
[1:01:44] i get up some
[1:01:44] i wake up sometimes an hour or two
[1:01:46] before i have to go to work and that's
[1:01:48] the first thing i like to do is say lord
[1:01:49] you want to talk to me about something
[1:01:51] you know
[1:01:52] and sometimes i don't get nothing but
[1:01:55] you know what i'm still waiting on him
[1:01:56] to maybe he won't stalk to me
[1:01:59] you know sometimes i don't know about
[1:02:01] y'all sometimes i woke up in the middle
[1:02:02] of the night early in the morning and
[1:02:04] you know it's a good time to talk to the
[1:02:05] lord
[1:02:06] you know he said well lord you don't
[1:02:07] talk to me and you know sometimes the
[1:02:10] only thing that happens
[1:02:10] is a song comes on my mind
[1:02:15] and sometimes i'm just sitting there and
[1:02:16] i'm just and i'm just i just start
[1:02:18] singing
[1:02:20] it's just you know just in my mind or
[1:02:22] sometimes just really low
[1:02:23] but you know i'm i'm sitting there and
[1:02:25] all of a sudden i start singing to the
[1:02:26] lord
[1:02:27] and you know it's it's you know maybe
[1:02:28] the lord don't speak to you
[1:02:30] something but you know what it's that
[1:02:31] time together that you that you know the
[1:02:33] lord you know the lord that comes and
[1:02:35] speaks to you
[1:02:36] and all of a sudden you know there's
[1:02:37] times that i've gotten woke up and it's
[1:02:39] like
[1:02:40] lord what do you want to tell me and all
[1:02:41] of a sudden somebody comes on my heart
[1:02:43] and you know it's time to pray for
[1:02:44] somebody you know you start interceding
[1:02:46] and sometimes you don't know what's
[1:02:47] wrong you just you just know that i
[1:02:49] have gotten this person on my heart and
[1:02:51] i just pray for them and sometimes later
[1:02:53] on you'll find out you know
[1:02:54] they're sick or they have a need or you
[1:02:56] know there's there's something that's
[1:02:57] going on in their life and you know it's
[1:02:59] time that you can intercede for them
[1:03:01] it's god wanting you to
[1:03:02] intercede on their behalf but you know
[1:03:04] many times we don't sometimes we think
[1:03:06] well you know that's just kind of
[1:03:07] simple or you know but you know you we
[1:03:10] need to understand that
[1:03:11] you know god doesn't call us just to do
[1:03:14] simple things and
[1:03:15] you know there's nothing in god that's
[1:03:17] insignificant
[1:03:18] you know many people many people think
[1:03:20] well you know i'm not i'm not brother
[1:03:22] dale or i'm not brother wade you know so
[1:03:23] i i can't do these things i can't have
[1:03:25] the lord you know i'm not this person or
[1:03:28] you know i'm not an
[1:03:29] eloquent person or all these different
[1:03:30] things you know it doesn't really matter
[1:03:33] people people are well you know i'm i'm
[1:03:34] a teenager i'm this you know they want
[1:03:36] to find their
[1:03:37] excuses you know that god can't speak
[1:03:39] together but many times it's you that
[1:03:41] god wants to use
[1:03:42] god wants you to understand that you are
[1:03:44] able to do
[1:03:45] god's able to use you
[1:03:51] let god use you
[1:03:58] so
[1:04:01] if it
[1:04:06] we have these things you know all these
[1:04:10] he says we are troubled on every side
[1:04:12] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[1:04:14] not in despair you know
[1:04:16] you know there may be trouble all around
[1:04:18] you but you know you don't have to be in
[1:04:20] distress like a lot of other people
[1:04:22] you face problems and trials and
[1:04:24] heartaches but you know
[1:04:25] we we know where we we can know where we
[1:04:27] stand and you know
[1:04:28] it's just uh as the old saying is he
[1:04:31] said when you get to the end of your
[1:04:32] rope just
[1:04:33] tie a knot and hang on just hold on
[1:04:36] because you know that's
[1:04:37] that's the place where god wants you to
[1:04:38] be amen and you know he always
[1:04:41] like was reading the scripture he said
[1:04:43] you know with every temptation there
[1:04:44] comes a way of escape
[1:04:46] and you know many times we just got to
[1:04:48] wait on the lord and he'll show you the
[1:04:49] way that you need to go
[1:04:51] you know and this this is a very
[1:04:53] perplexing time
[1:04:56] you know people people look at the the
[1:04:58] things that as went on in the world
[1:05:00] today and
[1:05:00] and all the things and and you know you
[1:05:03] see and and you wonder
[1:05:04] you know where where people's minds are
[1:05:06] and and all these things and
[1:05:08] i was uh listening to a man who's
[1:05:12] who's supposed to be a preacher and and
[1:05:14] he posts these things on
[1:05:16] online and and uh
[1:05:19] he's he's really against this uh wearing
[1:05:22] a mask and you know
[1:05:23] and he just gets on this thing about
[1:05:24] wearing a mask and he just can't believe
[1:05:25] people wear masks and clothes churches
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:28] and all this type stuff and he's like
[1:05:30] well i go in these stores he said i'm
[1:05:31] not going to wear a mask and he said
[1:05:33] they're not going to stop me
[1:05:34] and he said he went to some restaurant
[1:05:35] they told him said you can't come in
[1:05:37] here without a mask on
[1:05:38] and he won't get belligerent with the
[1:05:40] with the man because he's like you're
[1:05:41] not going to make me wear a mask
[1:05:44] and the man told him so well you know he
[1:05:45] said he said you're going to leave and
[1:05:47] he said you come back he said i'm going
[1:05:48] to lock the door on you
[1:05:51] and then he got in he got into this
[1:05:53] little altercation with this man
[1:05:56] and this man's supposed to be a preacher
[1:05:57] and he gets on there and he says
[1:06:00] well if you try to do anything to me i'm
[1:06:01] gonna kick your teeth in
[1:06:05] and i thought my goodness i if i said
[1:06:08] that i wouldn't get on
[1:06:10] if i got on if i got on facebook or
[1:06:11] something and i was going to tell
[1:06:13] anybody i threatened to kick somebody's
[1:06:14] teeth in
[1:06:15] the first thing i'd be doing is i'd be
[1:06:17] apologizing
[1:06:20] i can't i can't and you know and he
[1:06:22] thinks he's okay
[1:06:24] i don't know what kind of testimony of
[1:06:26] jesus christ that you're going to get up
[1:06:28] you know
[1:06:29] if i said something like that i'd be
[1:06:30] embarrassed
[1:06:34] what kind of what kind of what kind of
[1:06:35] person is that i mean well
[1:06:37] you know and they said well we're we're
[1:06:38] preaching the gospel
[1:06:42] i'd be ashamed of myself if i got to
[1:06:44] that i'd go sit down
[1:06:48] i could you know and and people and
[1:06:50] people think this is this this is this
[1:06:51] is
[1:06:52] this is courage this is this is
[1:06:54] christianity no it's not
[1:06:56] that's right you know and everybody's
[1:06:59] like well you know
[1:07:00] we've got all these people out here that
[1:07:01] all these different different groups and
[1:07:03] you know they're out you know
[1:07:04] if they don't if you don't if you don't
[1:07:06] meet their demands and if you don't
[1:07:07] treat them right the next thing you know
[1:07:09] they tear up your store and
[1:07:10] set car on fire and do everything else
[1:07:12] and they think this has really changed
[1:07:14] we're really doing something
[1:07:17] and you know you know and the problem is
[1:07:19] is the world is growing insane but when
[1:07:21] the when
[1:07:22] when the church people start acting the
[1:07:24] same way how in the world are you
[1:07:25] supposed to be trying to preach jesus
[1:07:27] christ and bring salvation to a lost and
[1:07:29] dying world
[1:07:30] when you're acting the same way they do
[1:07:34] how in the world are we supposed to show
[1:07:36] show the love of god
[1:07:37] when people like well you know what you
[1:07:39] punch me well i'm gonna punch you right
[1:07:40] back
[1:07:43] i mean it's terrible
[1:07:47] that's right one because you know the
[1:07:49] the problem is is people don't
[1:07:50] people don't have a real genuine
[1:07:53] experience and the people that are in
[1:07:54] the pulpits don't have one either so
[1:07:56] nobody has any way of explaining it or
[1:07:58] teaching
[1:07:58] or preaching anything to anybody because
[1:08:00] it's just a bunch of
[1:08:03] theology that doesn't get you anywhere
[1:08:05] that it's not anything that has to do
[1:08:06] with
[1:08:07] that's anything that's in the lids of
[1:08:08] the bible it's not it's not anything
[1:08:11] and then this is what people want to
[1:08:12] preach and talk about
[1:08:16] it and it's a terrible situation to see
[1:08:18] you know because you know
[1:08:21] we're this is not our home that's right
[1:08:23] man
[1:08:24] you know we're just passing through this
[1:08:27] this is this is not this is not my
[1:08:29] this is not my fight that's right my my
[1:08:31] goal is to make heaven my home i'm
[1:08:34] just getting out of here you know y'all
[1:08:35] can fight but you know people argue and
[1:08:37] fuss over stuff but you know i tell them
[1:08:39] listen y'all y'all just rearranging the
[1:08:41] deck furniture on the titanic this
[1:08:42] thing's going down
[1:08:44] you know because people don't realize
[1:08:45] you know the thing is what are you going
[1:08:47] to do
[1:08:47] because one of these days that your your
[1:08:49] soul is going to be required of you
[1:08:51] and the question is have you made
[1:08:53] preparations
[1:08:54] right amen that's right are you are you
[1:08:56] going to are you going
[1:08:58] when when time comes are you going to be
[1:09:00] able to cross that veil are you going to
[1:09:02] have to face
[1:09:03] a living god you have to face a just god
[1:09:05] with the things that you've done
[1:09:06] when you've heard when people have heard
[1:09:08] the salvation of jesus christ and know
[1:09:10] what god has given
[1:09:12] and preached a message to show you
[1:09:13] there's a way to escape this world
[1:09:15] to escape the sin of this world to
[1:09:17] escape all of the destruction
[1:09:19] and all these things to get that we can
[1:09:21] receive eternal life have you made
[1:09:23] preparations for that
[1:09:26] have you made preparations to get out of
[1:09:28] here
[1:09:31] we see every single day we see
[1:09:33] california having earthquakes and all
[1:09:35] these different things and
[1:09:36] and you're seeing all these things and
[1:09:37] you know what every single year you look
[1:09:39] you look over the last 10 years
[1:09:41] and people don't realize that it's just
[1:09:42] gotten worse and worse
[1:09:44] and worse and worse and worse but you
[1:09:46] know like like paul said
[1:09:48] it's the the blindness see the blindness
[1:09:50] has come upon the people
[1:09:51] and they don't realize it satan has
[1:09:53] blinded their eyes to not see
[1:09:55] what is taking place they
[1:09:58] they just get loud just rock to see
[1:10:00] their sleeping they think they're okay
[1:10:03] they don't realize how worse this thing
[1:10:04] is getting because a thinking man
[1:10:06] a man that had eyes that could see man
[1:10:09] they would be ready to go
[1:10:13] as as wade was preaching on talking
[1:10:16] about the uh
[1:10:18] the passover you know when when they got
[1:10:20] ready you know they saw the things that
[1:10:21] had taken place in egypt when all of the
[1:10:24] uh
[1:10:25] plagues and all the things that had
[1:10:26] taken place and seen the things that
[1:10:28] were going on down there in the
[1:10:30] destruction
[1:10:31] and all those things and saw where they
[1:10:32] were standing and when he told him he
[1:10:34] said now it's time to take your lamb
[1:10:36] and get it and put the blood on the
[1:10:37] doorpost and on the lentil and get ready
[1:10:40] have your shoes on
[1:10:41] get ready to eat this meal and be ready
[1:10:43] to get out of here
[1:10:44] it's time to go well then you know what
[1:10:46] then you and i should be doing the same
[1:10:48] thing
[1:10:48] we should have ourselves ready to go
[1:10:50] from head to toe
[1:10:51] with uh with everything that we have to
[1:10:53] have that's put on this whole armor of
[1:10:55] god to be ready to go
[1:10:56] with our staff and our hands our shoes
[1:10:58] be ready and then be able to be
[1:11:00] eating this lamb
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:04] well you know that's the only thing that
[1:11:05] should be ready is is
[1:11:07] eating the word it's being ready to go
[1:11:13] but people think it's going to be okay
[1:11:15] and not realize
[1:11:18] how bad it is
[1:11:21] but god has called us to get out of here
[1:11:25] and make ourselves
[1:11:26] and and to tell the world what kind of
[1:11:28] condition this world's in

[1:30:06] back home and that's
[1:30:07] that's the scary thing about this whole
[1:30:09] virus is you're up there by yourself
[1:30:12] you have no support um and the doctors
[1:30:15] and nurses are probably as scared as you
[1:30:17] are
[1:30:17] you know as far as what's going on with
[1:30:19] this covet thing but
[1:30:21] um god knew this was going to be here
[1:30:26] he any any i believe he prepared us for
[1:30:28] it sometimes you
[1:30:30] uh as i said before you know characters
[1:30:33] built in the battle
[1:30:34] characters not built sitting at home

[1:30:39] it's built in a it's built in a battle a
[1:30:41] battleground that's for character
[1:30:43] is a victory it's not just something
[1:30:46] that you get
[1:30:46] so it's just something we got to go
[1:30:48] through don't worry about it
[1:30:50] but sunday we will uh try to continue on
[1:30:54] with the lord just
[1:30:54] pray for brother dale bless his heart

[1:31:30] that does miracles right that's right
[1:31:32] the devil can do whatever he wants to do
[1:31:34] that's okay
