[6:52] getting taught by
[6:54] them but it's not it's just revers we're
[6:58] going to be the ones in the Temple
[7:00] teaching the ones outside all right but
[7:03] now there's not in this right here this
[7:06] is

[7:09] home at this point but yet it could be
[7:12] the future home at this point all right
[7:15] to the house of God of Jacob and he will
[7:17] teach us of his ways and we will walk in
[7:19] his paths for out of Zion shall go forth

[7:31] sword against Nation neither shall they
[7:33] learn War
[7:35] anymore this can be a twofold this can
[7:38] be either in the Millennium or the
[7:39] future home all right now let's go to
[7:42] Isaiah 9 that brother joh just
[7:52] read this is the promise of the baby
[7:55] Jesus coming let's read
[7:56] verse six For unto us a child is born
[8:01] unto us a son is given and the
[8:02] government shall be upon his shoulder
[8:04] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[8:05] counsel of the Mighty God the
[8:07] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[8:10] of the increase of his
[8:12] government not our government you know
[8:14] we we're glad today that that we have a
[8:17] government that's
[8:19] independent
[8:20] um not very good at all we know that the
[8:24] United States is going to get their
[8:26] judgment but still I'd rather live here
[8:28] than anywhere on the face of the Earth
[8:29] amen right maybe Alaska but that's still
[8:32] the United States of America
[8:36] okay of the increase of his government
[8:39] and peace there shall be no end upon the
[8:42] throne of David here is the promise to
[8:46] the Jews that David's son will sit on
[8:50] the throne Rule and Reign Over his
[8:54] people that's the Millennium that's the
[8:57] remember brother randam said that that
[8:59] that God comes in
[9:01] three right Son of God Son of Man son of
[9:04] David all right and um or son of man Son
[9:07] of God Son of David all
[9:09] right but he was actually Son of God in
[9:11] the Old Testament which is Spirit God
[9:13] Son of God is Spirit God son of man is
[9:16] is God In the Flesh that's son that's a
[9:18] son of man all right then remember he
[9:21] left and come back on the day of
[9:22] Pentecost as a Son of God in the end
[9:24] time he's come back as the son of man
[9:26] but he's promised in the Bible to come
[9:28] as son of David to the Jews because they
[9:31] missed him the first time so he's to
[9:33] come in the Millennium to rule and Reign
[9:36] a thousand years over the 12 tribes and
[9:38] right here is the the prophecy upon the
[9:41] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[9:44] order it and to establish it with
[9:46] judgment and with Justice from
[9:47] henceforth even forever the Zeal of the
[9:50] Lord of hosts will perform this all
[9:54] right so that Throne of
[9:57] David is the the davidic Covenant you
[10:02] can if you got a scoffield Bible he'll
[10:04] tell you to go to 2 Samuel we won't go
[10:06] there for saing time 2 Samuel 7
[10:11] 8-17 now the
[10:14] promise sure we know the natural promise
[10:16] of David was was to Solomon sit on the
[10:18] throne all right and
[10:21] then he did but the spiritual promise
[10:25] the one the the real son of David was
[10:28] Jesus Christ all right so he's promised
[10:31] to come in the Millennium now he won't
[10:33] set he in the Millennium he's going to
[10:35] set is the son of
[10:39] David but he won't be son of David in
[10:41] the future home what's he going to
[10:45] be all in all right all right
[10:49] Revelations let's turn over to
[10:51] Revelations
[10:53] 20 excuse me
[11:09] one
[11:10] verse chapter 21 chapter
[11:14] 21 verse
[11:16] one now this is the future home we're
[11:19] going to kind of parallel a little bit
[11:20] today and then we'll go back and just
[11:21] stick with what's going to happen in the
[11:23] Millennium all right and I saw a new
[11:25] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[11:28] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[11:29] away and there were no more sea now this
[11:32] is the Battle of Gog and Magog it's all
[11:34] finished the white Throne judgment is
[11:36] over all the Sinners are in hell all the
[11:40] Christians are in heaven but where is
[11:44] heaven and I John saw the holy city New
[11:48] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[11:52] heaven so where are we going to live
[11:55] right here on this earth right we're not
[11:57] going to heaven Heaven's coming right
[11:58] here this is what God made this Earth
[12:00] for all right there is no heaven to go
[12:04] to brother BR said heaven was silent
[12:06] nobody was up there right right we're
[12:08] all down here and I saw the holy city
[12:11] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[12:13] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[12:15] for her husband because when that City
[12:18] comes down it is for you and I remember
[12:22] we we read last week that in the
[12:26] Millennium in Isaiah 65 it says that we
[12:29] will build and
[12:31] inhabit future home is not that way this
[12:34] is what's coming down from John 14 and
[12:39] I'll read it you don't have to turn to
[12:40] it but I'll read it John 14 is the
[12:43] future
[12:47] home let your not Hearts be troubled you
[12:50] believe in God believe also in me and my
[12:52] father's house or many mansions if I
[12:55] were if it were not so I would have told
[12:56] you I go to prepare a place for you and
[13:02] if I go and prepare a place for you I
[13:04] will come again now in Isaiah it did not
[13:06] say that Isaiah said we would build we
[13:10] would
[13:11] inhabit right we read it last Sunday
[13:14] this says Jesus is going to prepare a
[13:16] place for us and if I go and prepare a
[13:18] place for you I will come again and
[13:20] receive you unto myself that where I am
[13:23] there ye may be also and whether I go
[13:26] you know and the way you know and we
[13:28] know who who the way is now let's go
[13:30] back to chapter
[13:32] 21 so where is the future homecoming to
[13:35] this Earth but it's a city already built
[13:39] and it's going to sit down right on top
[13:40] of a mountain in the Millennium there
[13:43] will be a mountain the mountain of
[13:44] Olives right but we're going to build
[13:48] and inhabit that piece of land here is a
[13:52] future home coming
[13:54] down and I heard a great voice out of
[13:57] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[14:00] God is with men and he will dwell with
[14:03] them and they shall be his people and
[14:05] God himself shall be with them and be
[14:08] their God and God shall wipe away all
[14:11] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[14:12] no more death nor sorrow no crying
[14:14] neither shall there be any more pain for
[14:16] the former things are passed away and he
[14:18] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[14:20] make all things new and he said unto me
[14:23] right for these words are true and
[14:24] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[14:28] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[14:30] the end I will give unto him a thirst of
[14:31] the Fountain of the Water of Life freely
[14:34] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[14:35] things and I will be his God and he
[14:37] shall be my son right there he's taking
[14:40] away all Jew
[14:42] Gentile
[14:44] Heathen blah blah blah he's taking all
[14:47] that away he's come to one spot he that
[14:49] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[14:51] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[14:55] all right and that's where we're coming
[14:57] to there now that that's
[14:59] not in the Millennium that Revelation 21
[15:03] is in the future home all
[15:06] right in the Millennium he's the son of
[15:09] David we're there as a
[15:12] what honeymoon we're there as a honey
[15:15] the Millennium is
[15:17] really nothing to us except we're going
[15:21] to be there because we're already
[15:23] Eternal Body Spirit and
[15:25] soul we don't have anything to do with
[15:27] the Jews natural
[15:29] right and we don't have to We Can't Live
[15:31] A Thousand
[15:33] Years we're Eternal that's
[15:36] right somebody's got to live a thousand
[15:38] years but it's not that that that
[15:40] Millennium is not saying the bride's
[15:42] going to live a thousand years we're
[15:45] going to live in eternity we started in
[15:46] eternity when you receive a new birth
[15:48] here but our body's going to be changed
[15:51] here all right so when we go into
[15:53] Millennium the Millennium is nothing
[15:55] more and I don't want to make it so
[15:56] little that it's nothing but it's really
[15:59] not anything to the bride cuz we don't
[16:02] have to when we accepted Christ we went
[16:05] into that Eighth Day we come out of that
[16:07] thousand years that God said the day you
[16:10] eat thereof that day you die we're
[16:12] already in that now cuz the day you eat
[16:14] of whatever you you know Methodist
[16:16] Baptist bromite whatever you eat of that
[16:20] fruit you'll die in that day all right
[16:23] so we've come through all that we got
[16:25] all that out of the way that's done so
[16:28] in the Millennium we're just there to
[16:32] relax um I don't think we'll just sit
[16:34] around you know on a log doing nothing I
[16:37] think there's things we'll
[16:39] do soon you probably going have to get
[16:42] up all
[16:43] right so now in Isaiah 9
[16:48] though it promised that the Jews would
[16:50] have a son of David sitting on the
[16:54] throne ruling the 12 tribes of Israel
[16:58] all right okay so
[17:00] now you got you got a question go ahead
[17:04] um in my Bible I had written a while ago
[17:07] from someone U where it says that there
[17:10] was no more sea there was no more mixed
[17:14] multitude of of Mind people would be one
[17:17] mind like you said
[17:19] right yeah there'll be no more SE and
[17:21] that of course C is like I said see
[17:23] water is people seea is people but I see
[17:26] that too is that when brother random
[17:29] explain see it said there would be no
[17:31] more sea didn't say there wouldn't be
[17:33] any more ocean right said there would be
[17:35] no more sea all right now this is just
[17:39] my thoughts on this
[17:44] matter this is
[17:46] Israel right here's the Mount of Olives
[17:49] what is this right
[17:53] here well every how you smell every how
[17:56] you smell that
[17:59] the Mediterranean
[18:02] Sea 1,500 miles that mountain is going
[18:05] to push up what's it going to do it's
[18:07] going to do away with the Mediterranean
[18:09] Sea
[18:10] right because from Israel to to Rome or
[18:15] Italy that comes down like the boot
[18:17] thing is about 1500 miles so if that
[18:21] mountain pushes up there's not going to
[18:23] be any more sea no more Mediterranean
[18:26] Sea the Mediterranean Sea it'll just
[18:28] push out out cuz the Mediterranean Sea
[18:30] is kind of you know in a a big Gulf like
[18:32] thing it's just going to push out and do
[18:34] away with the
[18:36] sea but it can't do away with the ocean
[18:38] cuz I don't think God created the oceans
[18:41] and the whales and the Dolphins and all
[18:43] that for them to just disappear I don't
[18:45] think that'll happen Okay so that's way
[18:47] I look at it in a carnal sense or in a
[18:50] natural sense of what's going to happen
[18:52] and then in a spiritual sense there'll
[18:54] be no more seed there'll be no more
[18:56] mixed like she like said there be no
[18:58] more mixed m you to people that's got
[19:01] this opinion and that opinion so like he
[19:02] said he that's overcome I'll be his God
[19:06] and that's what you're going to see
[19:07] because even in Revelations
[19:09] 21 on
[19:11] over it says I saw no Temple therein so
[19:14] for the Lamb of God Almighty and I mean
[19:16] the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are
[19:18] the temple are
[19:21] thereof okay so there's not going to be
[19:24] sacrifices you know Jews everybody's
[19:26] going to come into one mind I don't
[19:29] think the people outside the city are
[19:31] going to have the knowledge that we have
[19:33] because they'll have to be taught things
[19:37] right all right go ahead one more what's
[19:41] what do you think David's Position will
[19:42] be in the future home do what David King
[19:45] David what do you think his position
[19:47] would be in the future
[19:49] home Ian will he have a province here we
[19:53] go back again I don't want to be mean
[19:55] but I really don't care I mean it has
[19:57] nothing to do with us I mean really
[20:00] David I don't think he'll sit on a
[20:02] throne ain't going to be but one Throne
[20:04] that's what I just read you right here
[20:05] right a going to be one throne and we
[20:08] going to know who that man
[20:10] is because there's going to be one
[20:12] throne and God's going to be sitting on
[20:14] it see and that's it there's going to be
[20:18] not another
[20:19] Throne sure we're the Throne of God but
[20:22] there's going to be one throne and that
[20:23] King Jesus is going to be sitting on
[20:25] that Throne they ain't going to be a
[20:26] King David they ain't going to be a king
[20:29] whoever right Solomon ain't going to be
[20:31] a King Solomon there going to be a King
[20:33] Jesus and that's going to be it because
[20:35] we know he's the one that did all the
[20:37] work for us right and that gives me that
[20:40] gives me hope that I don't have to say
[20:43] well do I have to go to this King to get
[20:44] to this king or go to this to get no
[20:47] that's like you just Jesus all and all
[20:49] King Jesus that's what he said he said
[20:50] I'm all on his shoulders exactly the
[20:53] government's on his shoulders it's his
[20:54] it's his see John 14 is his problem to
[20:57] to fix right understand what I'm saying
[21:00] let's just be plain street Lan John 14
[21:02] was his problem to fix and he fixed it
[21:05] right see this is this is kind of um
[21:08] man's problem the Millennium because God
[21:11] said you eat a thousand years you know I
[21:13] mean the day you eat there of that day
[21:14] you die man's the one that messed it up
[21:17] I know God's got to bring it back but
[21:19] still even in the Millennium there's
[21:21] things going to transpire we're going to
[21:22] actually use our hands to do things
[21:24] we're actually going to probably build
[21:26] and put together and you
[21:33] know I don't understand all that but I
[21:36] know one thing's for sure in the future
[21:38] home that was my next
[21:41] Point you're going to see King
[21:45] Jesus and that's
[21:48] it see you got you got things that are
[21:51] transpiring in the Millennium because
[21:53] scriptures having to be fulfilled once
[21:55] you get to Revelations 21 and 22 there's
[21:57] no more scripture to be fulf F right we
[22:00] just go Rush straight into into the you
[22:02] know into the the glory of the Lord and
[22:05] they'll be King Jesus and he'll be the
[22:06] light and we're not going to have to
[22:09] worry about going you know I think
[22:11] what'll happen is that that the people
[22:14] on the outside of the city when you talk
[22:17] to them I believe they're going to say
[22:19] hey those people are so connected to God
[22:22] to their God in human
[22:24] flesh because when I go somewhere with
[22:26] my son he's connected to me because he's
[22:28] my son son right M right right can't
[22:31] deny it can't get away from it and if in
[22:34] the natural he thinks like I do then how
[22:37] much more the spiritual that the the the
[22:40] the God of all glory has G you the mind
[22:42] of Christ well if he's given you the
[22:44] mind of Christ then that mind that's the
[22:46] same mind if if Christ is thinking that
[22:48] same way you're thinking that same way
[22:49] right how do you think in the Bible it
[22:51] says before we even think it God will
[22:55] already have it there that's right right
[22:57] well that's not a human mind human mind
[22:59] can't do that human mind is pretty fast
[23:02] but it's not that fast right that when
[23:04] you say I'd like to have a house built
[23:06] and boom there it is he's already got it
[23:08] there for you asked for it right you
[23:10] know I'd like to have you know this and
[23:12] that and the other so and what a
[23:14] wonderful thing but on in the Millennium
[23:16] he's going to be the son of David in the
[23:19] future home he King Jesus and and let's
[23:22] put this to right here all in all
[23:29] and we're not going to listen folks he's
[23:31] not going to
[23:33] lose you know the Bible says sunship
[23:35] will terminate because through the son
[23:37] you and I get born again through the Son
[23:40] of God Son of Man coming and dying
[23:42] releasing the life which is the Son of
[23:44] God that makes us newborn babies in
[23:46] Christ and then we grow in Grace and
[23:47] knowledge but hey when we get to right
[23:50] here that's King Jesus and it's all in
[23:54] all but we're not going to ever forget
[23:57] that he was Jesus on Earth Earth that
[23:58] died for our sins we're not ever going
[24:00] to forget that he was the son of God
[24:02] that came to you one day to give you the
[24:03] New Birth when the Bible says the
[24:05] sunship will terminate that's where
[24:06] people in the meage say oh you're saying
[24:08] Eternal sunship he's always going to be
[24:11] Eternal Son of God he's always going to
[24:13] be Eternal son of man he's always going
[24:15] to be Eternal son of David right because
[24:17] that's what the Bible this is the
[24:18] Eternal Word of God and if it said in
[24:20] here it can't go away right but when we
[24:23] get
[24:24] here we've been through this already the
[24:27] son of d David part has been
[24:30] manifested but when you manifest
[24:32] something that don't mean you do away
[24:33] with it that means it just becomes a
[24:35] part of you okay everybody understand
[24:37] that become a part of do what will that
[24:40] part just be a memory that part will be
[24:42] a memory but we
[24:44] remember
[24:45] how the surely the the the Jews will
[24:49] will realize it more than we did cuz
[24:52] that's what they're looking for they're
[24:53] looking for God to come and sit on a
[24:55] throne in Jerusalem and rule over the 12
[24:58] tribes just like he promised him he
[24:59] would it be more like a revelation
[25:02] exactly it'll stick exactly memories
[25:04] don't stick Revelations do the
[25:05] Revelation you got a one God is not
[25:07] going to go away when we get in a future
[25:09] home right when we go into eternity and
[25:11] walk through the streets of gold we're
[25:13] going to come back to that basic one God
[25:16] principle and we're going to know he's
[25:18] that one God we're going to look at him
[25:19] right straight in the face right and and
[25:22] and not forget the journey because the
[25:24] Bible says the former things will pass
[25:25] away the bad things m former things will
[25:29] pass away even in our human mind there's
[25:30] a lot of things remember they say that
[25:32] if something catastrophic happens in
[25:33] your life that your mind will cut it off
[25:37] well guess what God will do he'll just
[25:39] throw that thing over and the see of
[25:41] forgetfulness and you won't
[25:42] remember I mean I don't know about you
[25:46] but let's turn to Isaiah 11 and get that
[25:48] finished before
[25:50] we I don't know about you but uh I'm
[25:54] going enjoy talking about Fellowship we
[25:56] had down here amen
[26:14] verse
[26:18] six now
[26:21] this can be applied to both Millennium
[26:25] and future home all right the wolf shall
[26:27] also dwell with the lamb and the leopard
[26:29] shall lay down with a
[26:30] kid I want us to get one thing in our
[26:34] mind God does things in steps so that we
[26:38] can understand it cuz remember in his
[26:40] mind it's already finished anyway but he
[26:42] does things in steps to let us see
[26:44] things
[26:46] right so what's he doing here he's
[26:49] showing us that he's bringing everything
[26:52] and restoring it back cuz remember if
[26:54] this pen
[26:56] drops I got to pick that pen back up to
[26:58] the same place not down here not up here
[27:00] same place for that to be restoration so
[27:04] man was at a place to where this right
[27:06] here actually went on in the Garden of
[27:12] Eden before the
[27:15] fall before the fall lions eat
[27:20] grass
[27:22] huh man ate
[27:25] fruit okay so that's exactly what we're
[27:27] going back to cuz what did we fall from
[27:29] we fell from that condition the Earth's
[27:31] got to come back to that condition but
[27:33] it's going to be done in stages the
[27:36] Millennium is something that God has put
[27:38] in there to show that when he told Eve
[27:41] he said the day you eat thereof that day
[27:43] you'll die then we read last Sunday
[27:45] where a day is a thousand years and a
[27:47] thousand years is a day all right so to
[27:50] God he was saying that hey you eat of
[27:53] that fruit you're going to die you're
[27:56] never going to live a, years
[27:59] years if you eat because what Eve's
[28:03] problem was is she partook of what
[28:05] happened in the garden we know it's not
[28:07] fruit it was a sex act fruit in the
[28:09] garden cuz remember you're what are you
[28:11] you're the fruit of your mother's womb
[28:13] okay the Bible says many many times
[28:16] you're the fruit of the womb all right
[28:18] so that's what he was talking about but
[28:21] you take God in the garden he said the
[28:23] day you eat of that day you die well
[28:25] when Eve done what she done she didn't
[28:28] didn't die that day she didn't die the
[28:30] next day she didn't die the next day so
[28:33] she built her a denomination she built
[28:36] her an idea that hey I'm helping
[28:40] God and the devil's going see there you
[28:43] didn't die let's do it
[28:46] again so she took it to her
[28:49] husband you didn't die instantly God
[28:51] said you'd die don't you know the devil
[28:53] was standing there when all that
[28:54] happened you know that he wasn't off
[28:56] somewhere on vacation he was standing
[28:58] right there okay so the day you eat of
[29:02] that day you die well now what God what
[29:04] what has God got to do methusa live
[29:07] 969 years and that's the oldest man ever
[29:10] to live all right so nobody lived a th
[29:14] now to prove that the sin curse is done
[29:17] away with somebody's going to live at TH
[29:19] what was the sin curse back in the
[29:20] garden
[29:22] right right not to break God's law but
[29:25] to prove that God was promising them
[29:27] that if you eat that and you do that and
[29:29] you sin that day you're going to
[29:32] die so now to prove that that's over
[29:35] with somebody's going to live a thousand
[29:37] years and like I said it's not us that's
[29:40] right we're not even in a day we're in
[29:42] an eighth day we're in an eternity so
[29:44] it's not to us it's somebody's going to
[29:45] live a natural 1,000 years during that
[29:48] Millennium to prove that's why I say is
[29:51] it going to be if you ever thought about
[29:53] this is it going to be a millennium of
[29:54] 360 days 365 days right because in the
[30:00] back in the garden the Earth was
[30:02] standing straight
[30:05] up so it's 360 days cuz you got to go
[30:09] back to the restoration right you don't
[30:11] go back to January February March April
[30:13] and then you have to have a leap per of
[30:14] a fourth year no it's 30 days to a month
[30:17] somebody will live A Thousand Years
[30:20] prove that the sin curse is over then we
[30:23] go into whatever the Battle of Gog and
[30:25] Magog or the white Thor judgment but you
[30:27] see like I'm saying it's not just boy
[30:29] when that Thousand-Year day is up
[30:32] remember God Blends everything together
[30:35] it's not something for God stops and
[30:36] starts something again all right so this
[30:39] Millennium the wolf shall dwell with the
[30:41] lamb leopard shall lie lay down with a
[30:43] kid calf and the Young Lion and the
[30:45] fatling together and a little child
[30:47] shall lead them and the cow and the bear
[30:49] shall feed not on each
[30:51] other their young on shall lie down
[30:54] together and the lion shall eat strong
[30:56] like the O and the suck sucking child
[30:59] shall play on the hole of an ass and the
[31:01] weaning child shall put his hand in the
[31:03] cockatrice den see that's the Millennium
[31:06] cuz there won't be any children in the
[31:08] future home now brother brandham they
[31:10] ask him said will children be born in
[31:11] the Millennium probably because of this
[31:13] scripture he said some way I can see yes
[31:15] some way I can see no but that doesn't
[31:17] matter to me and you don't get hung up
[31:19] on that cuz you and I are not going to
[31:21] be doing that right in the Millennium
[31:24] we're
[31:25] Eternal the the desire of of husband and
[31:28] wife is going to be over with we're
[31:30] going to have a much higher love than
[31:32] that right but somebody may do that I
[31:35] don't know cuz there's got to be a
[31:36] person somebody's got to live a natural
[31:39] Thousand Years all right we better
[31:42] go we's see you next
[31:50] Sunday what
