[6:39] the beginning in the end of the creation
[6:41] and holy name of our Lord Jesus we pray
[6:45] amen let's let's sing that little song
[6:50] this world is not my home
[6:51] whose want to go home pretty soon as
[6:54] soon as our work is done I want to go
[6:56] home whatever is holding it up
[6:59] I find us to know about it we can do
[7:01] something about it this world is
[7:14] [Music]
[7:26] [Music]
[7:40] [Applause]
[7:48] [Music]
[7:52] [Applause]
[8:09] [Music]
[8:46] no way in the world will get worse than
[8:49] the bride gets better well I'm excited
[8:52] to be serving God I believe that God can
[8:55] do anything because of me in the last
[8:58] four months I have a van stolen and all
[9:01] that was such a bummer remember of
[9:03] leaving to going to the Walmart and
[9:04] leave my keys there funny little feeling
[9:07] as I looked at them keys I got my man
[9:09] standing and praying and praying and
[9:12] praising it dawned on me the other
[9:14] evening and of course God knows where
[9:17] the van is
[9:18] and you know also knew that they were
[9:20] sorry for leaving the keys in the car
[9:22] and a lot of the things that I do it was
[9:25] just a moment between God and I remember
[9:27] the next morning it yeah right before we
[9:30] get up as you're kind of talking to the
[9:32] Lord that you kind of also get that last
[9:33] couple little weights and I was thinking
[9:35] about that van thinking what a
[9:37] powerfully wasn't that phone ring and
[9:39] the police call this is with information
[9:41] on that van it's other one got that old
[9:43] van after almost four months so got to
[9:46] do anything he really wants to get our
[9:50] attention first and I believe as soon as
[9:53] he taught me whatever it was he was
[9:55] teaching me in it there's a few things
[9:57] which I don't want to mention most about
[10:00] that guy in the mirror but uh it was
[10:03] happy to give it back amen because happy
[10:06] to answer your prayers
[10:07] I think we're failing because we quit
[10:10] right before we get there I think we're
[10:14] beginning if we're not careful to listen
[10:16] to the devil's bluff because I can write
[10:18] a book and all the reasons why we've
[10:20] never seen
[10:21] my carnal mind it was packed down into a
[10:24] 400-foot square piece of metal it was
[10:27] gone it would never come back but in the
[10:30] mind of God that was not so and when my
[10:32] mind and God's might begin to talk
[10:34] together I realized he knew where that
[10:36] families and in one little moment I
[10:38] realized he knew that I was sorry
[10:41] and I could talk to him mrs. Lawry could
[10:44] we bring this to a conclusion the next
[10:46] morning
[10:47] EEMA very very grateful amen the only
[10:50] part they messed up the keys so that old
[10:52] key would work you know we just got
[10:55] ourselves another kid we took up an
[10:57] assembly we started that thing sometimes
[10:59] our lives are like that you have to
[11:01] start over you have to destroy what
[11:03] doesn't work or or what's been corrupted
[11:06] yeah and get what's right because if
[11:08] it's right it'll start that's what the
[11:11] message is it's powerful because it has
[11:13] a restarting ability you've never done
[11:15] when you're in the message of the hour
[11:16] you can totally blow it you can you can
[11:18] be as bad as the Apostle Paul was
[11:20] killing Christians and still your life's
[11:22] just about to begin
[11:23] yeah that's one more reason why I love
[11:26] this message because he just just
[11:28] doesn't lose you
[11:31] let's sing one more song all you saints
[11:34] of life proclaim Jesus the light of the
[11:36] world
[11:39] himself my child it will take away from
[11:42] this understanding the promise to Jesus
[11:45] and promises the revelation of the word
[11:48] amen

[13:56] [Applause]
[14:00] [Music]
[14:17] [Music]
[14:52] the eyes of the world it just looks like
[14:54] a very small little meeting small little
[14:57] building a small little people but in
[14:59] the eyes of God it's the greatest thing
[15:01] that's happening on planet Earth is this
[15:03] moving this message amen and we're part
[15:06] of it how many can say you're part of it
[15:09] for the good for the bad for every bit
[15:11] of pain that caring preaching ears every
[15:14] bit of overcoming you're part of all of
[15:15] it amen amen let's sing that song you
[15:19] ask me why I'm happy

[18:30] [Music]
[18:38] [Applause]
[19:09] [Applause]
[19:56] there's something about you ever lose
[19:59] something mom would always tell me go
[20:02] remember where you had at last brother
[20:05] Brandon when he was dealing with that
[20:07] one believer who had lost his is closest
[20:11] to the Lord his joy in the Lord they
[20:14] said go back to where last you remember
[20:16] when you had God and I think we can all
[20:20] say there's a point where we went up to
[20:23] the altar and we put our all in it on
[20:25] that altar and we threw ourselves before
[20:28] the cross and said Lord forgive me in
[20:29] such joy fill our souls that's a great
[20:32] place to start if you're just if the
[20:34] world side attracts you you can look
[20:35] back to that cross and you can trace
[20:38] your steps from there and see where he
[20:39] went wrong yeah I was ever so ready to
[20:42] put us right back on that path he does
[20:45] it for me pretty much every day because
[20:46] this world is a nasty mean place but God
[20:50] has ever been as good as as as we need
[20:53] to combat that amen
[20:55] let's sing that song it truly is the
[20:58] center of our universe the cross is the
[21:00] center of my universe at the cross

[23:16] [Applause]
[23:18] [Music]
[24:07] [Music]
[24:27] Thomas next thing usually right after
[24:30] the cross that you feel this is an
[24:31] intense gratitude to the Lord to think
[24:34] when they say such acts of love I've had
[24:39] that where I was in a hard spot and
[24:42] someone I didn't even know would just do
[24:43] so much for me and that brings about a
[24:46] real feeling of love and gratitude when
[24:49] Christ did it in spite of me being the
[24:51] worst I could possibly be he reached
[24:54] down like that if that doesn't fill you
[24:57] with love not only for him but you're
[24:59] for each other then we need to go back
[25:02] to the cross and try again because it
[25:05] truly is overwhelming when God reaches
[25:07] down to us amen and start the course

[55:56] evils come in very good very good love
[56:06] the Lord brother branham was talking one
[56:09] time when he's praying for someone who
[56:10] could not hear he said Satan was
[56:14] blocking that eardrum he said but the
[56:17] Word of God move Satan out of the way
[56:19] and stimulated the eardrum again Lyman
[56:22] could hear and he talked about there was
[56:25] a light in the body yeah I think today
[56:29] don't lose that light and Satan is that
[56:32] he is good at making us despair or be
[56:35] frustrated don't believe and just
[56:39] believe the song instead believe those
[56:41] believe the anointed of God songs and
[56:44] and the life that you've seen it's a
[56:46] bluff the devil cannot win and so he is
[56:50] gone to every despicable tactic he can
[56:54] and at the same time the bride is coming
[56:57] to a righteousness that was never known
[57:00] since the early days of Pentecost and

[1:12:01] way it is you know we in America were
[1:12:02] burdened down with all the mojitos and
[1:12:04] insurance and cars and guns and this and
[1:12:07] that is that they don't have know that

[1:12:21] people three automobiles three
[1:12:23] automobiles they've all wrote bus you
[1:12:26] know whatever
[1:12:27] - your many blessings Romans chapter 10
[1:12:36] I know probably something I'll probably

[1:12:41] open-heart surgery and I thought I was
[1:12:43] gonna get to go home but more than not

[1:12:59] I'm feeling better and more no they
[1:13:02] think so brother hum right they I don't
[1:13:04] think I'll never get as old as you are
[1:13:09] you been through so much we love we love
[1:13:12] all the ministers brother all of you
[1:13:14] the bride we just listen this is the
[1:13:18] greatest truth has ever struck there
[1:13:19] this is our bleep revelation of Jesus
[1:13:21] Christ right Anna that's right I've been
[1:13:22] in 38 years I wouldn't trade it for
[1:13:24] anything there's nothing out there
[1:13:25] there's no place to go there's nothing
[1:13:27] to trade it for there's nothing worthy
[1:13:29] obviously this is it so I'm just happy
[1:13:35] you know but I was saying it in the
[1:13:39] Bible or conflate revelation 10 7 but in
[1:13:41] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:43] angel you know thinking about the boys
[1:13:45] you know and because we had one push for
[1:13:49] this generation not Satan Pence standing
[1:13:51] so he he's have to manufacture and
[1:13:53] actually pervert many voices so he's got
[1:13:56] hundreds thousands of voices all kinds
[1:13:59] of horses I mean you could go through
[1:14:01] maybe you go through politics you could
[1:14:03] go through every avenue there's all
[1:14:06] kinds of voices out there to try to
[1:14:07] stumble you know to get you off the
[1:14:09] beaten path and cause you to doubt and
[1:14:11] not believe what report are we gonna
[1:14:15] listen to yeah
[1:14:17] in fact we're gonna talk about that a
[1:14:20] little bit this afternoon
[1:14:21] listen you know use that preacher when
[1:14:23] he dances he preaches usually drinks of
[1:14:27] something increased before but I've been
[1:14:29] studying on this trip for months I've
[1:14:30] never preached this before I guess so
[1:14:31] guess what you all are the first for
[1:14:34] this Romans chapter 10 verse 13 reads
[1:14:38] like this for whosoever shall call upon
[1:14:43] the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:14:45] Mars 14 how then shall they call on him
[1:14:48] and whom they have not believed and how
[1:14:50] shall they believe in him whom they have
[1:14:52] not heard how shall they hear without a
[1:14:56] preacher how shall they preach except
[1:14:58] they be sent as it is written how
[1:15:01] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:15:02] preach the gospel bring glad tidings of
[1:15:06] good things but they have not all obeyed
[1:15:09] the gospel before he saying sir Isaiah
[1:15:12] said who has believed our report as
[1:15:15] isaiah 53:1
[1:15:16] and he said in summer of 76 so then our
[1:15:20] answer is old navi's - he's a secret who
[1:15:23] has believed our report so then faith
[1:15:25] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:15:29] word of God the notice there's something
[1:15:33] very interesting well this parade
[1:15:35] mileages be seated Heavenly Father were
[1:15:37] so thankful Lord to be in the house of
[1:15:39] God yes so thankful is the brother said
[1:15:41] to be the house of God but thank the
[1:15:42] Lord that you desired even from the
[1:15:45] foundation of the world you knew the
[1:15:47] fall you know about it you orchestrated
[1:15:49] everything they had to be followed but
[1:15:51] all of them through time there was a
[1:15:52] plan of redemption you desire to live
[1:15:55] and Tabernacle back in human beings
[1:15:57] again and here we are in the last day
[1:15:59] the last message the last time before
[1:16:02] the two prophets of revelation 11 rise
[1:16:04] up and take them this same gospel to
[1:16:07] Israel but we've had a Gentile prophet
[1:16:09] to bring this great message to
[1:16:11] we might have the complete full
[1:16:13] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:16:15] we love you less Lord I pray the word is
[1:16:19] already anointed and don't mean to speak
[1:16:21] the point to people that hear hide me
[1:16:23] behind the cross may something be said
[1:16:25] that would be a eternal value as we
[1:16:27] leave the building this afternoon we
[1:16:29] could say did not our hearts burn within
[1:16:31] us as he talked to us along the way
[1:16:33] bless your children in Jesus name
[1:16:35] everybody says maybe they're gonna meet
[1:16:37] my seat for the invitation appreciate
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:42] just Tommy this is real many many years
[1:16:46] ago back in Arkansas we go way back
[1:16:52] choosing the right report so faith
[1:16:57] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:16:58] Word of God now it's very interesting
[1:17:02] when you take this suit your faith
[1:17:04] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:17:06] word by the Word of God that you go back
[1:17:08] and look that up in the Patti dialogue
[1:17:10] and it reads like this so faith comes
[1:17:12] and of course the Fatih dialogue is just
[1:17:15] the original Greek word by word they
[1:17:17] just put it in a flowing way it's so
[1:17:20] that faith comes from a report and the
[1:17:23] report through the Word of God says the
[1:17:25] same thing that's actually just a little
[1:17:26] bit more clear where it says it's faith
[1:17:29] cometh by hearing but you you've got to
[1:17:31] have something to hear what are you
[1:17:32] hearing you're here to report so faith
[1:17:34] comes from my report and the report
[1:17:37] through the Word of God so he's saying
[1:17:40] who has believed our report and I was in
[1:17:43] 53 up there's 12 verses east he talks
[1:17:45] all about the oldest sufferings and the
[1:17:47] prophecy of the Messiah so he's asking
[1:17:50] you and he before it actually comes to
[1:17:52] pass that who out there is gonna believe
[1:17:54] my report before it happens that takes
[1:17:58] faith to believe a report before it
[1:17:59] happens
[1:18:00] so therefore must be run through the
[1:18:02] Word of God it must be channeled through
[1:18:05] the Word of God it must be backed up by
[1:18:06] the Word of God so we will continue my
[1:18:09] face we've got done we better be careful
[1:18:11] what report we listen to that's right
[1:18:13] amen so in deal with us off we want to
[1:18:16] examine the effects of Katies cornea
[1:18:19] we're gonna learn something this
[1:18:20] afternoon my ministry is kind of
[1:18:22] teaching him and I didn't know and I'm
[1:18:26] sure you're going to learn some things
[1:18:27] in fact Hades Barnet that you didn't
[1:18:29] know because I did several months ago
[1:18:31] and actually what really happened to
[1:18:34] Katie's cornea it's a game-changer
[1:18:35] when you learn just a few what really
[1:18:37] happened you'll see more why those
[1:18:40] twelve spies tenderly tended and to
[1:18:43] bleed tended believe you're going to see
[1:18:45] why
[1:18:46] what they did was such an awful harm
[1:18:48] palm the state that they dedicate then
[1:18:52] we uh read some application out of that
[1:18:56] probably one of the most important
[1:18:58] principles actually happened to Kate's
[1:19:00] Barnea and so I'm going to labor that go
[1:19:02] to detail so I want everyone to see in
[1:19:05] fact the church Berlin see it stands at
[1:19:07] Katie's right now I'm gonna read a few
[1:19:09] posts the tabernacle right now stands at
[1:19:11] Katie's carnea look that he was so close
[1:19:14] till they even tasted that grapes out of
[1:19:16] the land they eat the grapes when came
[1:19:19] over them whenever came back with the
[1:19:21] grapes in fellas pulled off some and eat
[1:19:23] them oh that are good but we can't do it
[1:19:25] and there they have tasted the good word
[1:19:28] of God have tasted the Holy Spirit seen
[1:19:30] the good
[1:19:31] tasted of it and it tasted the Word of
[1:19:34] God see not none of the enemy have not
[1:19:37] one of them ever permitted to go over
[1:19:39] they perished in their own land
[1:19:41] over here in the wilderness they never
[1:19:42] went over yet they was so close they
[1:19:44] can't even taste it
[1:19:46] how close are we today come on so close
[1:19:49] to promised to actually crossing over so
[1:19:52] close they taste it but not enough grace
[1:19:54] and pace to take it that's what it is
[1:19:55] another place residences oh brother
[1:19:57] sister word it take the screen off of
[1:19:59] her Nina you're tasting it now another
[1:20:01] place he says Rick hey sweetheart
[1:20:03] scuse me and pages partying and God's
[1:20:06] Word said we can take it we're getting
[1:20:09] ready to cross over plus we really are
[1:20:11] brothers Daniel we ought to get II
[1:20:13] rented the car to cross over let's go
[1:20:16] back to Ankara here we kind of pick this
[1:20:18] up and just kind of go through some
[1:20:19] background just a little bit I want you
[1:20:21] to get this background and Genesis 15 3
[1:20:24] you don't have to turn to and he said a
[1:20:26] neighborhood no I'm a charity that
[1:20:28] dynasty shall be a stranger in a land
[1:20:30] that is not theirs and she'll serve them
[1:20:33] they still afflict them 400 years
[1:20:36] so here's the process they're going to
[1:20:38] be down there for 100 years I spent in
[1:20:39] 430 verse 14 and also that nation whom
[1:20:43] they shall serve when Iowa generates an
[1:20:45] expert you know they come out with great
[1:20:47] substance on my kids were coming out of
[1:20:49] Egypt to see the seed of Abraham will be
[1:20:53] in a strange land for 400 years you know
[1:20:55] what happens with people get in a
[1:20:57] strange land
[1:20:58] they miss the strange things and it's
[1:21:01] our
[1:21:01] strengths yeah and sometimes they would
[1:21:03] come straight you this is a strange idea
[1:21:05] you you and I endorse that and think
[1:21:09] about it too long you're going to become
[1:21:11] that so stay away from that strength
[1:21:13] ideas yeah Jacob in his family they
[1:21:16] finger pretty well down Itza well Joseph
[1:21:18] was still alive but you know they wrote
[1:21:20] after Joseph died the Rosa Rosa for
[1:21:23] failure who forgot thee the death that
[1:21:25] that Joseph really because what he did
[1:21:27] eat you OB Joseph this one multiplied
[1:21:30] each a got real concern then after that
[1:21:33] they'll also freedom just kind of kind
[1:21:35] of go suit some offense they've become
[1:21:37] slaves and Natalie in the land of
[1:21:38] bondage and remember for about three
[1:21:40] hundred years the two individuals they
[1:21:42] were actually influenced by and ography
[1:21:44] so you see after after the failure of
[1:21:47] the new Jose after he died a new Pharaoh
[1:21:49] come home then he forgot about the debt
[1:21:51] that they hope to Jacob and Joseph with
[1:21:54] his really Joseph in his family and so
[1:21:56] they begin to insert beginning to
[1:21:58] multiply so they begin to make slaves
[1:22:00] out of my persecutor we put them in
[1:22:01] bondage now because for the about three
[1:22:05] hundred years they actually was so
[1:22:07] influenced by tradition of tradition to
[1:22:09] my dollar Creek just like Laodicea and
[1:22:11] how many how many years are have we been
[1:22:15] actually influenced by the traditions
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:19] we've back in the pinnacle the Church of
[1:22:21] different churches we come out up I mean
[1:22:23] we had to forget one idea to come into
[1:22:25] the message but we was influenced by
[1:22:27] that for years whose influence but we
[1:22:30] had to lay all that data coming to the
[1:22:32] truth and finally their afflictions got
[1:22:35] some bad thing
[1:22:36] they finally prize for deliverance
[1:22:37] Mosul's is born races favor us house
[1:22:39] trials delivered Israel course he failed
[1:22:42] then he pleads to the desert marries it
[1:22:44] has a family
[1:22:45] finally he meets God in a burning bush
[1:22:47] it's a gun survey he met God he finally
[1:22:50] got hold of something real even though
[1:22:52] he was ordained to that he met God it
[1:22:55] returns back to Pharaoh says now let my
[1:22:57] people go but see by this time this to
[1:22:59] to me to ask people doing half-million
[1:23:02] people they were really ready to go
[1:23:03] because they've been mended bodies for
[1:23:05] all these years
[1:23:06] beaten the mistreating and slaves and
[1:23:09] they kill their babies in horrible
[1:23:10] conditions just like layoffs see today
[1:23:12] kind of like the day the horrible
[1:23:14] conditions we're losing our freedom that
[1:23:16] killed the babies idolatry our message
[1:23:18] is persecuted we know we've had faint
[1:23:20] roads we've had Kennedy in Johnson and
[1:23:22] Nixon Clinton and Obama and who knows
[1:23:26] what we got how you know well he's
[1:23:28] better than then Hillary I guess but
[1:23:30] then another who's going to go what you
[1:23:32] say well we've had a little reprieve I
[1:23:34] don't know we've had a little free of me
[1:23:35] this his wife comes up Melania starts
[1:23:37] Catholic so we don't know where he's
[1:23:39] going but we know where it's going we go
[1:23:42] where it's going so that's the main
[1:23:43] thing so we can have all kinds of Figaro
[1:23:46] soon and they begin to you know they
[1:23:49] went with when God began to bring them
[1:23:51] out of the land of Egypt they saw all
[1:23:53] kinds of miracles there's all the ten
[1:23:55] plagues and fell on the Egyptians
[1:23:57] ourselves now
[1:23:58] all that ten evil plays but you know the
[1:24:02] children fizzled out they found favor
[1:24:04] with your hoho God so the kind of the
[1:24:06] Red Sea and this imposing what she did
[1:24:08] what she already do it God delivers
[1:24:10] again and they dance and shout you know
[1:24:12] I'm married with the tambourine because
[1:24:14] they were delivering this all you know
[1:24:17] Pharaoh and his army was drowned they're
[1:24:18] delivered one more taxing Wow yeah we're
[1:24:20] on the world I wrote to the promised
[1:24:22] land

[1:24:24] legroom we're coming out of Egypt we've
[1:24:26] seen all these planes now happy you know
[1:24:29] I just found favor with us we found
[1:24:30] favor than him just through it Egypt you
[1:24:33] know the chariots are gone we're being
[1:24:34] women the problems they pretty soon so
[1:24:39] that was excited yeah and this listen
[1:24:41] let's gotta get the picture yes sir
[1:24:43] you know that they were really excited
[1:24:45] about what's taking place now in Exodus
[1:24:47] chapter three years now that the promise
[1:24:49] sin I had company after deliver them out
[1:24:52] of the hands of the Egyptians and just
[1:24:54] bring them up out of the land the land
[1:24:55] into a good land and a large land and
[1:24:58] flowing with milk and honey
[1:24:59] unto a place of the Canaanites and the
[1:25:01] hittite hasn't memorized the PERS rise
[1:25:02] in the high rise and Egyptian get
[1:25:05] besides and they they absolutely knew
[1:25:07] that God had promised him back land now
[1:25:09] I promise you that man the land that God
[1:25:12] promised us her after he promises
[1:25:15] away
[1:25:19] but somebody somebody's gonna listen to
[1:25:23] the wrong report but somebody has done
[1:25:25] this to the rider floor Leviticus but I
[1:25:28] have said you you shall inherit their
[1:25:30] man what a promise and I will give it
[1:25:33] unto you to possess it laying the folks
[1:25:35] with milk and honey hind the Lord your
[1:25:37] God with him separated you from other
[1:25:39] people God always we want to his bride

[1:25:43] separate he said you're not even
[1:25:44] wrecking for the nation's he wanted to
[1:25:47] be separated and that's why when you
[1:25:49] come out of her revelation 18:4 second
[1:25:51] competing at 6:17 we are supposed to be
[1:25:54] a separated people right and a lot of
[1:25:56] people want to deal it down Ali with the

[1:26:14] other so actually they had a promise
[1:26:17] that covenant a land of their
[1:26:18] inheritance and actually just looking at
[1:26:21] it this way God actually had been
[1:26:23] preparing this Promised Land for these
[1:26:25] four hundred years while they were down

[1:26:44] didn't know it but they did yeah they
[1:26:48] actually I mean they actually got the
[1:26:50] land prepared for them

[1:27:33] so excited we're inheritance we'll have
[1:27:36] just a few weeks did it now stay away
[1:27:41] don't you understand in this background
[1:27:43] now they traveled they left Egypt they
[1:27:46] traveled one year in one month and came
[1:27:48] to Mount Sinai
[1:27:48] they spent 11 months is now Sonia remain
[1:27:52] about 20 stop including outside here in
[1:27:54] Phoenix Barnea
[1:27:55] and finally they arrived at Katie's
[1:27:57] party and two years later two years
[1:27:59] right we times out of Egypt two years
[1:28:02] later they arrived at Taste party now
[1:28:06] Davis Barney is a very very special
[1:28:08] place a very special place memory now
[1:28:14] there in the world of forty years after
[1:28:16] two years their taste
[1:28:18] Katie's for Nia is actually the border
[1:28:21] of cross the ends of the promised land
[1:28:23] Katie's partying is actually the gate
[1:28:25] length into the Promised Land
[1:28:27] because the people or today's journey
[1:28:28] that actually would be there yes now
[1:28:35] that case let's talk about caves a
[1:28:38] little bit
[1:28:39] this is where this is where the plot for
[1:28:42] the thickens and as I said you're not
[1:28:44] going to we I didn't even know this
[1:28:46] until I really got this researching this
[1:28:48] and it changes the whole aspect of how
[1:28:50] we look at this spies in the spy mission
[1:28:53] brother Bennett says now that game is
[1:28:56] change party up in Cadiz Barney was at
[1:28:58] one time of the judgment seat of the
[1:28:59] world the place had great big whale big
[1:29:02] Springs there was many little Springs
[1:29:05] out of it a palm grove like in the
[1:29:07] desert what a beautiful place
[1:29:09] they tied a great judgment seat of God
[1:29:11] in heaven where God's Word is a law book
[1:29:13] and their judgment at the bottom of
[1:29:16] heaven and every little spring
[1:29:18] representing the church where the
[1:29:19] judgments of God go for breaching
[1:29:22] judgment when they found there they were
[1:29:23] on the border of the promised land you
[1:29:27] can understand that a cage party was on
[1:29:29] the book as actually was a game range
[1:29:31] but when he came down on the corner when
[1:29:34] he comes to the border of the promised
[1:29:36] land on the border that's where they
[1:29:38] made their big mistake they stopped the
[1:29:41] border net was an emotional scene as
[1:29:45] they made their fatal mistake when they
[1:29:47] fail to go home
[1:29:48] they were on their journey not not very
[1:29:50] many miles more they could have made it
[1:29:52] in a few days with all this two million
[1:29:55] people out of it out of the desert if
[1:29:57] they stay on the path but when they came
[1:29:59] to a place called cage Barnea Hades
[1:30:02] party at what time I'm told the great
[1:30:04] judgment seat it sends a great spring of
[1:30:06] oil there and many little wells a
[1:30:07] perfect time for the church the church
[1:30:09] is the judgment seat maybe you say
[1:30:14] something the churches we know the Bible
[1:30:16] says we all got to stand before the
[1:30:18] judgment of God now worry is gonna take
[1:30:20] our judgment here or we're going to fix
[1:30:22] it there in the church and
[1:30:25] the house of God people don't want to
[1:30:28] come to church and hear our preaching
[1:30:30] and have get reconciled back to God
[1:30:33] cause we're gonna have to face it come
[1:30:53] to the house of God preached to me tell
[1:30:55] me what I'm doing wrong
[1:30:56] don't resist love it these don't have to
[1:31:01] so we're gonna get in one place or the
[1:31:03] other
[1:31:04] collision in the mail because judgment
[1:31:07] is mixed with mercy here yes when we
[1:31:09] talk about judgment well we're not
[1:31:11] actually our sins is already judged we
[1:31:13] know that but is a house of correction
[1:31:16] we've got to be corrected human beings
[1:31:19] are just not flawless we've got to be
[1:31:21] corrected yeah hey man
[1:31:25] so remember now half of its in we're at
[1:31:28] taste party oh right now now Cadiz was a
[1:31:30] special place you know what a nice party
[1:31:32] it means
[1:31:33] hey the word Cadiz means holy the word
[1:31:38] Barnea meets a desert of wandering so
[1:31:43] what it means a holy place in a desert
[1:31:47] of wandering so they were a caged Barnea
[1:31:50] actually it was a little oasis out there
[1:31:53] in the desert
[1:31:54] it was a holy place of the judgment seat
[1:31:56] of the world at one time he says it's a
[1:31:58] holy place in the desert hundred and it
[1:32:01] was part of the desert of Cu which isn't
[1:32:03] that big a desert you know so it's a
[1:32:06] little oasis out there
[1:32:08] that's where the church is we're read
[1:32:09] where in case where the judgement seat
[1:32:11] and go that it is an oasis hadn't we
[1:32:14] have an oasis had we had the word come
[1:32:16] and we exceed on it and the water supply
[1:32:18] three minutes oh brother if you talk
[1:32:20] about those oasis we had an Alexa we're
[1:32:23] happy going say that they're being a
[1:32:26] water would be in there to remove innit
[1:32:28] you got last amen brother a holy place
[1:32:34] in a desert of wandering so let's look
[1:32:37] at Deuteronomy chapter one okay now what
[1:32:40] happened page he said well I don't know
[1:32:43] the story no you don't know the story
[1:32:46] and when I think I like yoga well you
[1:32:51] don't have to but we get to over two
[1:32:53] numbers one again Deuteronomy one I want
[1:32:55] you to follow with me but just listen
[1:32:57] there are only one 119 when they
[1:32:59] departed it from Horo they went through
[1:33:01] all the great terrible illness which he
[1:33:04] saw by the way to the mountains of the
[1:33:05] MRIs as the globe and I God commanded us
[1:33:07] and we came to case Barnea and I said if
[1:33:10] you you are coming to the mountains of
[1:33:12] the amorite which the Lord our God
[1:33:13] doesn't give unto us behold the LORD thy
[1:33:16] God has set the man before they go up
[1:33:18] and possess it and the Lord my God my
[1:33:20] father's hand since the fear not needs
[1:33:23] going to be disturbed or - a fear not
[1:33:24] because he knew there's going to be some
[1:33:26] bad yeah but he said I've given you this
[1:33:28] land
[1:33:30] so now here's here's something that we
[1:33:33] were looking at this is a key than
[1:33:35] available state already Katie's Lansing
[1:33:38] place who requested the spy mission to
[1:33:43] log shoot we know that I mean well God
[1:33:45] Bible says God God the ordered this five
[1:33:48] issue of did he well this seems me did
[1:33:51] who requested the spiders because human
[1:33:54] requested is actually the real critical
[1:33:57] crux of the whole issue mind already
[1:34:01] listen remember I already do about the
[1:34:04] land he you know he made the land he's
[1:34:06] but he that didn't happen it's good
[1:34:07] there he proved you know that he was God
[1:34:10] he's gonna make it to Lana I've given
[1:34:12] you the land but they artists all the
[1:34:14] miracles Wow well I wanted so who would
[1:34:17] his fastest I turned any Bibles to
[1:34:22] numbers chapter 13 what you don't you to
[1:34:24] read it out your vitals cuz we're gonna
[1:34:27] read two different places that I'm gonna
[1:34:29] actually I want to show you something
[1:34:30] and parallels very closely the water
[1:34:33] baptism as far as disappears number
[1:34:36] thirteen and one when everybody to read
[1:34:40] follow it you gotta say man numbers 13
[1:34:48] find the Lord spake unto Moses say the
[1:34:50] Lord spake unto Moses saying see the
[1:34:53] Delvian this they may search the land
[1:34:55] which I give unto the children Israel
[1:34:58] and every tribe of their fathers ye
[1:35:01] stand
[1:35:02] and each one of the room among them and
[1:35:05] Moses by the commandment of the Lord set
[1:35:08] them from the wilderness of Paran all
[1:35:11] those men were heads of the gym of
[1:35:13] Israel said well that sells well does
[1:35:18] that's one scripture now I want to ask
[1:35:21] you a question if I ask you to give me a
[1:35:24] scripture about water baptism and so you
[1:35:26] give me Matthew 28:19 and just one
[1:35:29] scripture does that once picture
[1:35:32] give me the identification of the answer
[1:35:39] not myself
[1:35:41] right not the understanding and we
[1:35:43] didn't have that understanding years ago
[1:35:45] but now I want to see that one scripted
[1:35:47] but see in the mouth of two or three
[1:35:49] witnesses that never were to be a
[1:35:50] statute all right so here we have it was
[1:35:54] with sig's like in the Bible says by the
[1:35:56] Moses by the commandment of the Lord sit
[1:35:58] them over there okay all right that's
[1:36:00] good now let's read the rest of the
[1:36:02] story that's what he Deuteronomy chapter
[1:36:04] 1 now in Deuteronomy chapters one two
[1:36:07] and three this has written the fortieth
[1:36:11] year and Moses actually is Greek
[1:36:13] recounting the whole 40-year wilderness
[1:36:17] journey and the experiences in the
[1:36:19] wilderness and so he's given up a notary
[1:36:21] for you or a review in chapters 1 2 or 3
[1:36:24] of Deuteronomy 1 and he's actually just
[1:36:26] reflecting back and telling a pretty
[1:36:28] detailed how things went you know in the
[1:36:34] woods and the reason he did that is
[1:36:36] because you know everybody in over 20
[1:36:38] years old had died at all so he was
[1:36:40] explaining to the young
[1:36:41] Generation Y was so important to knocked
[1:36:44] out but to believe God's Word why they
[1:36:47] had to stay 40 years
[1:36:49] why didn't God ever intended them to
[1:36:51] just be able to use his will because he
[1:36:53] never intended that he intended to take
[1:36:55] them right straight to the promised land
[1:36:57] yeah for two years they should have been
[1:36:59] in there they should have been there now
[1:37:02] and Deuteronomy chapter 1 let's start
[1:37:07] with the person I think you'll you'll
[1:37:11] see something here in just a minute
[1:37:14] everybody read with me and when they
[1:37:16] departed from Mora
[1:37:17] we came through all the great terrible
[1:37:19] wilderness which he saw by the way of
[1:37:22] the mountain of the hammerites as the
[1:37:23] Lord our God commanded us and we came to
[1:37:26] Kay's far near and I said it to you ye
[1:37:29] are come to the mouth of the anoraks
[1:37:30] which the Lord our God give us unto us
[1:37:34] and behold the LORD thy God hath sent
[1:37:36] the land before thee go under possess it
[1:37:38] that's that's the or go tackle and go
[1:37:41] comes in and as the Lord God the Lord
[1:37:44] God of Our Fathers hath said unto thee
[1:37:45] fear not neither be discerned now look
[1:37:49] at verse 22 and ye came near unto me
[1:37:54] every one of you and said we should send
[1:37:58] man before us and they shall search us
[1:38:01] out the land
[1:38:02] and bring us word again by what way we
[1:38:05] must go up into what cities we shall
[1:38:08] come really what the congregation the
[1:38:14] congregation where the people requested
[1:38:18] the congregation requested this
[1:38:20] population we go to Canada and Moses say
[1:38:23] and ye came near unto me every one of
[1:38:26] you and say will see it appear before us
[1:38:30] in the land and bring us word again by
[1:38:43] what we went wait we must go and into
[1:38:46] the cities we shall come the
[1:38:49] congregation yes certainly did
[1:38:51] and listen verse 23 and in the same
[1:38:53] please me well and I took 12 minutes you
[1:38:57] won't have a try I thought God did now
[1:38:59] mother said he did what do you see
[1:39:02] general Underwood 22 is actually the
[1:39:05] explanation specter of numbers 13 3 just
[1:39:09] like just like acts 2:38 is the
[1:39:12] explanation scripture of Matthew 28:19

[1:56:03] now Israel he is ready to make their
[1:56:07] choice either leave the two spies on the
[1:56:10] positive part or believe the 10 spies
[1:56:14] and therefore they can't make for the
[1:56:16] report so they had to decide but which
[1:56:20] one with an illegal can you take the
[1:56:22] later we're going to take the land or we
[1:56:25] can't take so you know what they did
[1:56:28] it took the easier right now yeah you
[1:56:31] know why because he get that the second
[1:56:34] 12 spies do came back with the grapes he
[1:56:39] came back from the crops

[1:56:48] grabbed me complain that God gave me the
[1:56:50] land and I don't care how big these
[1:56:51] giant so if this 40-foot tall God slay
[1:56:53] that 10 is fine go back to report it was
[1:56:58] not God's Way over the other 140 years
[1:57:00] that was there for the Heisman 40 days
[1:57:03] is fine 40 years of the wielders one day
[1:57:06] one year that's your punishment
[1:57:08] you shouldn't have to request this - why
[1:57:10] didn't even request this - I gave you go
[1:57:13] ahead go take it now you're punished
[1:57:15] because you're gonna stay here and
[1:57:17] you're gonna wander around and read over
[1:57:19] 40 long years and guess what the
[1:57:22] old-timers are gonna die off because
[1:57:24] they didn't believe him straight to
[1:57:28] claim to be a happy a wholly obedient
[1:57:30] people but they could not enter because
[1:57:32] of their unbelief didn't unconsecrated
[1:57:35] leaders who depended on strength at
[1:57:38] numbers instead of God tennis club's
[1:57:41] leaders brought back and either in
[1:57:42] report let's put it this way didn't
[1:57:45] those preachers both brought back an
[1:57:47] evil report but all those things down at
[1:57:53] God said they despised the promised land
[1:57:57] God said that in Psalm 106 2048 they
[1:58:01] despised the pleasant land they believed
[1:58:04] not his word but murmured in their tents
[1:58:07] and hearkened not unto the voice of the
[1:58:08] Lord therefore he lifted up his hand
[1:58:10] against them - overthrew them in the
[1:58:12] wilderness so what happened to you and
[1:58:15] I'm so excited they were so excited
[1:58:17] about being a director I mean feeling a
[1:58:19] promise like no so it's in thews how
[1:58:21] about going into the
[1:58:22] after two years or ten or 15 or 20 or 30
[1:58:27] however many of expense that you've been
[1:58:29] in a basin what happened in those years
[1:58:32] you've seen the hand of God you've seen
[1:58:35] that this you've indicated you've seen
[1:58:37] what truth is why are some still falling
[1:58:41] away what happened in those two years
[1:58:46] they saw ten evil plagues public
[1:58:49] Egyptians now that's all ten even
[1:58:51] preachers let an evil report following
[1:58:53] them cause of unbelief
[1:58:55] no mrs. now the yellow faith
[1:58:58] two million Israelites this is
[1:59:02] tremendous take the innovative too busy
[1:59:05] to be initialised the case for Nia was
[1:59:08] sowing the result of the negative
[1:59:11] influence and recommendation of
[1:59:13] temperatures 10 spies so you don't
[1:59:18] believe it absolutely I'm gonna say that
[1:59:21] you know too many lives elasticated was
[1:59:24] sowing there was the result of again the
[1:59:27] negative influence and the negative
[1:59:30] recommendation of these ten spies that
[1:59:32] came back said we just can't take the
[1:59:33] lead
[1:59:34] yeah God gave them the land the ten
[1:59:37] preachers talked about of it was a lie
[1:59:45] to begin with said how was the life we
[1:59:48] want proof okay forty years later Ram
[1:59:51] who was living in the promised land when
[1:59:54] they went over there she said to those
[1:59:56] two men that came up spy out the land
[1:59:58] which God actually Saints in next two
[2:00:00] minutes five missions she said to them I
[2:00:02] know this is 40 years later and she's
[2:00:05] living
[2:00:07] you know then this man needed something
[2:00:14] habits in we're like grasshoppers
[2:00:15] nearside this and that this talk about
[2:00:18] life it was a ladder to get brain I
[2:00:21] didn't believe that right she said she
[2:00:24] said I mean I know that the Lord has
[2:00:26] given you the land and that your terror
[2:00:29] is folded on us and all and all and all
[2:00:33] of the inhabitants of the land they
[2:00:34] change because of you
[2:00:43] that was the first terrorist that was
[2:00:46] the first terrorist no he said your
[2:00:48] terror has been all of our
[2:00:50] people but we have heard listener who
[2:00:56] hath believed our report before it comes
[2:01:01] to pass when you came out of Egypt and
[2:01:14] what he did for the two kings of them
[2:01:16] rest on the other side of Jordan Sidon
[2:01:18] and on whom he utterly destroyed and
[2:01:21] assumed as soon as we heard
[2:01:27] or courage in any manner because of you
[2:01:46] but the 10 spies said we're afraid we
[2:01:49] can't make their great
[2:01:51] there's something that their hand
[2:01:52] against theirs then zoom in sir whatever
[2:01:54] their giants we can't take the lid say
[2:01:59] you can go without your brother that's
[2:02:06] not going to be easy to take this
[2:02:07] rapture but he'd give it to us and we're
[2:02:10] gonna take it side of the Pope and
[2:02:16] everybody else we're gonna be there
[2:02:23] amen
[2:02:24] I hear this evil report calls to them
[2:02:27] the whole congregation think of it the
[2:02:29] influence of teen man cause the whole
[2:02:32] car wish to die spiritually die
[2:02:35] spiritually can you believe that Jesus
[2:02:38] said here call the city mana and the
[2:02:40] witness and there every woman who that
[2:02:42] said Eterna separates it not one of them
[2:02:44] say forty years old too many people my
[2:02:51] halls a town because of unbelief and
[2:02:54] they were God's chosen and to and then
[2:02:56] go around and show excited wonders and
[2:02:58] miracles and and bang it up and took
[2:03:00] care of her like a father with his
[2:03:01] children and then they disregarded and
[2:03:04] mother mum murdered and groomed and was
[2:03:07] going to kill the property chosen to
[2:03:09] take this Lord would you think about why
[2:03:20] why did they ever request a spy mission
[2:03:24] oh brother sister all the cause of an
[2:03:30] egg report I wonder what would be the
[2:03:32] faith of those who left the message
[2:03:33] instead and you know who listened to
[2:03:36] relieving the sign or believe the us or
[2:03:38] perhaps that you don't really need
[2:03:40] oh ministry and we don't forget a lot
[2:03:42] about the bridge you know they don't
[2:03:43] know what's going to be in everything I
[2:03:45] think what their fate is we the same
[2:03:47] fate as those two being died in the
[2:03:49] widow's touch my mind want to do my
[2:03:52] prophets of all right what
[2:03:56] so if faith comes by hearing so faith
[2:03:59] comes from a report and report through
[2:04:01] the Word of God so now I needed by the
[2:04:06] other hour but I'll take about ten
[2:04:07] minutes all right
[2:04:10] want to bring a little pair little
[2:04:12] application here so we found that we
[2:04:14] found out what really happened Kate's
[2:04:16] Barney was like we always saw the
[2:04:19] congregation requested this finally said
[2:04:21] worst worst thing that that was their
[2:04:23] fatal mistake where say they ever did
[2:04:26] God said go take it they should just
[2:04:28] whatever it took yeah they probably
[2:04:31] would have some cash be some loss of
[2:04:33] life be said he'll take it but if you
[2:04:35] believe he believed Donovan hey they
[2:04:37] they want any loss of life at Jericho
[2:04:39] they believe God did what God said
[2:04:41] Thompson we said yeah what happened yeah
[2:04:44] what happened with Aiken somebody got
[2:04:48] greedy somebody didn't follow the
[2:04:49] commandments of the Lord
[2:04:50] yeah now these teens 5 10 10 it's one of
[2:04:57] theirs up it could be a parallel
[2:04:59] anywhere an application with 10 I got to
[2:05:01] think about that the 10 plagues need you
[2:05:03] did evil spies 10 the 505 you to report
[2:05:08] and I'm going to maybe because Abraham
[2:05:11] Katie
[2:05:11] Hagar 10 years after Nathan came to know
[2:05:14] that that wouldn't be
[2:05:15] application but we sure see the ill
[2:05:18] effects of what happened when Abraham
[2:05:19] went into Hagar the Arabs in the and
[2:05:21] it's they've been fighting ever since
[2:05:23] the Lord since the God I want to know

[2:09:44] actually a said it's a trick of the
[2:09:45] devil's what it is yeah they hit them so
[2:09:48] addicted there and they go through the
[2:09:50] school and because this social media
[2:09:52] everyone sticks in this room does Texas
[2:09:54] with this one didn't get as many taxes
[2:09:56] get as many thumbs up this was not as
[2:09:58] painful so actually what it's actually
[2:10:00] caused that injury already has caused

[2:10:05] worse many of them feel rejected because
[2:10:07] we I don't have this and all my friends
[2:10:10] coming and they're getting all these
[2:10:11] texts and invitations this this it's
[2:10:14] immediate social mission media has it's
[2:10:16] actually infiltrated the minds and the
[2:10:19] brains of young people they just can't
[2:10:20] handle they can't cope with it yeah
[2:10:22] let's get out come for this this intense
[2:10:25] amount of information made much of the
[2:10:28] time is this it's negative and it's evil
[2:10:31] and it's it's it's not even encouraging
[2:10:34] I'm creeping they feel that down and
[2:10:35] then destitute despondent yeah brother
[2:10:39] said that these school shootings is it
[2:10:42] sure is not dummies out there but
[2:10:44] they're people that help they become
[2:10:46] despondent with school and they've been
[2:10:48] bullied and they've been dad and they
[2:10:50] take them you know and I'm gonna kill
[2:10:52] you know what you don't worry it's not
[2:10:55] the guns it's not the guns you say what
[2:10:58] you also it's not the gun I think what
[2:11:00] it is it's it's the damnedest things if
[2:11:03] they have watched 40 on television and
[2:11:05] movies and stuff like that killing and
[2:11:08] beaten and killing and murdering and for
[2:11:10] all these year they have seen it and
[2:11:12] watched it and see it and what what do
[2:11:14] you think it happened to the brains of
[2:11:16] these young people so brainwash with
[2:11:19] this television for all these years what
[2:11:22] do you think's in their mind yeah we say
[2:11:24] human beings are imitators yeah
[2:11:27] imitators if a baby if a baby was born
[2:11:31] to say babies born in America okay he's
[2:11:33] six months old
[2:11:34] okay you take that baby to Russia he
[2:11:38] lives in Russia for seven years he comes
[2:11:41] back to America
[2:11:42] yeah no no no word of English cozy and
[2:11:57] her English I had a person told me one
[2:12:00] time I was home guys
[2:12:01] you know take your children to church
[2:12:03] take him to church train him up in the
[2:12:05] way it looks it no I said I would never
[2:12:07] just like to make their own choices when
[2:12:09] they get to be 18 years old they can
[2:12:11] make the right choice that's a mom again
[2:12:14] chattering that they already do but
[2:12:18] yours I think they're they're born it's
[2:12:20] insane to me but it's time this Ross
[2:12:22] speaking hi they don't have a fighting
[2:12:23] chance to begin with but if you take
[2:12:25] them to church for 18 years they might
[2:12:27] at least have a chance to be same
[2:12:31] position those guys already taught me
[2:12:33] the devil didn't make that distinction
[2:12:35] for this giving me hope given television
[2:12:38] movies him
[2:12:40] video games give this fridge up there
[2:12:43] I'm the devil be the thing yeah shove
[2:12:47] the afraid of the very appearance of
[2:12:49] evil right the military you preach see
[2:12:52] more of this I'm tell my recent hard
[2:12:53] enough this this is where our generation
[2:12:57] has come to you know because they
[2:12:59] listened to the wrong report that's why
[2:13:05] it's so important to forsake not the
[2:13:07] assembling even some even said Mike
[2:13:09] still more as you see how are they
[2:13:11] approached read your Bible listen to
[2:13:13] tapes listen you know I know there's a
[2:13:15] lot of controversy about take turns and
[2:13:17] so forth and I don't believe take
[2:13:19] Turkish you know think hey you ain't got
[2:13:20] a place to go to church whatever but
[2:13:22] that's all fine and dandy but it did it

[2:13:26] line ministry I believe in the five hole
[2:13:28] ministry that's like
[2:13:29] that's gonna stay all right that's the
[2:13:32] terms of the word of God but a lot of
[2:13:34] people want to take the easy way out

[2:13:37] they don't deal with people you know
[2:13:39] just good it's good Church this to take
[2:13:41] go to sleep and whatever more yeah yeah

[2:21:20] when I was in the Air Force I always
[2:21:23] want to be a pilot there won't be a
[2:21:25] fighter pilot Vietnam so I didn't get to
[2:21:26] be a pilot really got to be crew members
[2:21:28] like I deflower c-130s c-130 big cargo
[2:21:31] plane so I got fined a few hours and
[2:21:33] you're flying cargo all over here and so
[2:21:36] I all of the hours that I flew on the
[2:21:39] c-130s improvement routine we got I got
[2:21:41] a pop in the flight mech with a pilot
[2:21:43] copilot navigated flight engineer so I
[2:21:45] was always on the headset and either
[2:21:47] take off the landing instructions but
[2:21:49] there was two times
[2:21:51] my flying career that I actually was
[2:21:53] skiers yes all the rest time I wasn't
[2:21:56] afraid I was on the headset there was
[2:21:58] instructions order one time we speech to
[2:22:01] make a landing and I was not on the
[2:22:02] headset at the time so I didn't know
[2:22:05] what the landing instructions were I
[2:22:07] want you to read between the lines down
[2:22:08] going home landing instructions so here
[2:22:12] we're off the coast of Spain is a little
[2:22:14] out and we're going to talk about some
[2:22:17] cargo with this allowed in the runway in
[2:22:19] that those islands over there they're
[2:22:22] just clips you know they've got a steep
[2:22:23] cliff you know 50-100 feet then just so
[2:22:27] happened that the runway span from this
[2:22:29] cliff to this cliff then once you run
[2:22:32] away little bitty small line okay so I
[2:22:36] didn't watch now you know for the pilot
[2:22:37] copilot but I think it landing
[2:22:39] instruction so I'm going sit out
[2:22:41] everyone come in flat fifty percent
[2:22:43] decrease in this thing landing gear down
[2:22:46] no more decent everything look good and
[2:22:48] I you know I just need a little bit more
[2:22:51] distance and I saw the runway or just
[2:22:52] the end of the runway as was coming in
[2:22:54] and he's over the landing at threshold
[2:22:56] he's little bit too fast but too high
[2:22:59] but he's gonna set it down
[2:23:00] I said he gonna be able make he'll make
[2:23:03] it so we're finished I was scared
[2:23:07] first time I've ever been scared
[2:23:10] well I knew he's gonna sit down I'm
[2:23:12] gonna be flying we're weeks weeks weeks
[2:23:15] I know
[2:23:16] set it down but he couldn't set it down
[2:23:18] because he'll stop click on the other
[2:23:19] hand she's just about to I realized he
[2:23:24] can't set it down
[2:23:25] he's making it right bacon pulled out I
[2:23:27] can look over my runaway boy was there
[2:23:29] was a shepherd on the runway about
[2:23:31] either 75 she made a low pass to run her
[2:23:33] sheep off the runway I said oh thank god
[2:24:05] [Applause]
[2:24:10] amen what a part of the message
[2:24:14] revelation takes away all of fear let's
[2:24:23] say the song wants to worship and just
[2:24:26] celebrate our victory over the devil
[2:24:29] really all the things God did when they
[2:24:32] were getting out of Egypt I was at a
[2:24:34] fair for that little place called cage
[2:24:36] for me how they fail that to such a
[2:24:39] vindication that God was with Moses but
[2:24:43] you know we're not gonna fail we believe
[2:24:44] the vindication never centerplex believe
[2:24:47] that it's no good for nothing
[2:24:49] but something deep in your soul makes
[2:24:52] the choice for Jesus Christ he is the
[2:24:55] spirit of Revelation learning listen
[2:24:58] that song to God be the glory
[2:25:01] [Music]
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:35] with this
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:46] till love on the seat we'll be seeing
[2:25:49] for a little minute some of the sisters
[2:25:50] left their detention
[2:25:51] just to prepare the meal some of them
[2:25:54] didn't get to come because they were
[2:25:56] preparing the food well that was a great
[2:25:59] feast I think what a surety we should
[2:26:03] have amen isn't it something that the
[2:26:06] direction of the people of God was taken
[2:26:09] out of the hands the supernatural
[2:26:11] and put into the minds of Tim spice plus
[2:26:14] pies and only two of them remember in
[2:26:19] that same joseline Caleb they did get
[2:26:21] their reward I'm glad
[2:26:29] I think sometimes work too fast as a
[2:26:36] society we fear the silent places but if
[2:26:41] it's a little Sun that's the time to be
[2:26:42] thinking where are we taking home with
[2:26:44] us we've gotta be in a boat our last
[2:26:48] land for this race we've got to just
