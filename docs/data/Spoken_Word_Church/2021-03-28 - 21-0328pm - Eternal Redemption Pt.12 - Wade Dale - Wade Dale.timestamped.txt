[17:26] if you would have your seats and
[17:27] musicians go ahead and sit down we've
[17:29] got a
[17:30] special testimony this afternoon from
[17:33] sister esther blatt
[17:34] esther black come and
[17:38] give us your testimony
[17:50] so um basically
[17:53] i got saved and here's how it happened
[17:56] um for a while of course i've wanted the
[18:00] new birth and
[18:01] uh recently it was just kind of like i'd
[18:04] get close to god then i'd kind of go
[18:06] back
[18:07] out then i'd get close to god it was
[18:08] just a constant tug of war
[18:11] and um i was tired of it you know i had
[18:14] had enough of it
[18:16] and so um i just really wanted the new
[18:18] birth you know and everyone would tell
[18:19] me you know you just have
[18:20] faith to believe and i was like yeah i
[18:23] grew up in the message
[18:24] i know these things i know the steps and
[18:26] stuff but i was like
[18:28] i don't know how to believe i don't know
[18:29] how to get the faith i need
[18:31] so um i was basically trying to do it on
[18:34] my own which was the problem
[18:36] you don't want to do that um so
[18:39] yeah it was just a constant tug of war
[18:41] between uh god and the devil you know
[18:44] and um so i just didn't really know how
[18:47] to be sincere in my heart
[18:48] so i started praying and asking god like
[18:50] please reveal to me
[18:51] like please show me how to get the faith
[18:53] i need just give me the faith i need
[18:55] so um i had started really praying about
[18:58] it maybe
[19:00] a week about a week before brother
[19:03] brother trevor came to preach
[19:07] and so god gave me an answer through his
[19:09] testimony
[19:11] and his testimony was that you know that
[19:13] brother face timed him and he said you
[19:15] know just confess just confess
[19:17] and so i was like okay you know
[19:20] you know i hear you talking to me god so
[19:23] um
[19:24] me and zach were riding in the car later
[19:27] and we were just talking about the
[19:28] services and
[19:30] um we were just talking about that and i
[19:31] i was telling zach you know like you
[19:33] know i was really struggling
[19:34] i don't really know how to have faith to
[19:37] get the new birth
[19:38] and zach was like well just do a i told
[19:41] uh
[19:42] him about how brother trevor had said
[19:44] just confess and he was like well
[19:46] then confess and the thing is i had said
[19:48] the words you know i decided to discuss
[19:50] my savior but you know i had said those
[19:52] words but nothing really seemed to
[19:53] happen and of course i had
[19:55] experiences at camps and stuff where the
[19:57] holy spirit would fall on me
[19:58] but i was never like satisfied after you
[20:00] know
[20:02] and um so he was like just confess it
[20:04] right now and it was kind of like how
[20:06] brother brandon would go in the woods
[20:07] and he would be like two plus two is
[20:08] four two plus two weeks four
[20:10] and it would just get stronger and
[20:11] stronger and so
[20:13] um he just said just keep confessing it
[20:16] and so i said okay
[20:17] i accepted this question my favorite he
[20:18] said say it again and at that point the
[20:21] presence of god with it was there and he
[20:22] was like say it again and i said i
[20:24] said jesus christ my savior and then he
[20:26] said say it again
[20:27] say it like you mean it you know and i
[20:29] was like i said jesus christ my savior
[20:30] and he said claim your heritage and say
[20:32] it again and at this point
[20:33] i knew that it wasn't it was
[20:36] god speaking through zach
[20:39] and not that creepy and it was like a
[20:42] spiritual connection
[20:43] and right there in the passenger seat of
[20:46] zach's car accepted jesus christ
[20:48] my savior and um so
[20:51] we got home and he told me just keep
[20:53] packing the word in
[20:55] just keep packing it in and that's what
[20:56] i did so i opened the bible app on my
[20:59] phone
[21:00] and there happened to be psalms 116 open
[21:03] and i knew for a fact that i had it
[21:05] after reading it and
[21:06] let me just read all this scripture it's
[21:08] not long this is my new birth scripture
[21:11] but it says i love the lord because he
[21:13] because he hath heard my
[21:15] my voice and my supplications because he
[21:18] hath inclined his ear unto me
[21:20] therefore will i call upon him as long
[21:21] as i live
[21:23] the sorrows of death compass me and the
[21:25] pains of hell get hold upon me
[21:27] i found trouble and sorrow then called
[21:29] that upon the name of the lord
[21:30] o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul
[21:33] gracious is the lord and righteous
[21:36] yea our god is merciful the lord
[21:38] preserveth the simple
[21:39] i was brought low and he helped me
[21:41] return unto thy rest o my soul for the
[21:43] lord hath
[21:44] dealt bound to flee with thee that's
[21:45] right for thou hast delivered my soul
[21:47] from death
[21:48] my eyes from tears and my feet from
[21:50] falling i will walk before the lord in
[21:52] the land of the living
[21:53] i believe therefore have i spoken i was
[21:55] greatly afflicted
[21:57] i said in my haste all men are liars
[21:59] what shall i render unto the lord for
[22:01] all his benefits towards me
[22:03] i will take the cup of salvation and
[22:05] call upon the name of the lord
[22:06] i will pay my vows unto the lord now in
[22:08] the presence of all his people
[22:10] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[22:12] death of his saints o true
[22:13] o lord truly i am thy servant i am thy
[22:16] servant and the son of thine handmaid
[22:18] thou has to loose my bonds i will offer
[22:21] to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving
[22:22] and will call upon the name of the lord
[22:24] i will pay my vows into the lord now in
[22:26] the presence of all his people in the
[22:28] courts of the lord's house in the midst
[22:29] of the o jerusalem praise you the lord
[22:32] and so yeah that's the scripture i read
[22:35] after
[22:36] and um it was the most amazing thing
[22:39] ever knowing that my chains were finally
[22:41] gone
[22:41] and i had been set free and um i just
[22:44] thought that this part was interesting
[22:46] but zach ended up going downstairs
[22:48] to hold my dog daisy and
[22:52] i was upstairs reading my bottle and i
[22:54] just heard daisy barking downstairs
[22:55] like really loudly and she usually
[22:57] doesn't act like that daisy's like a
[22:58] good dog
[23:00] and so zack comes upstairs he's like oh
[23:01] my gosh you won't believe what just
[23:02] happened
[23:04] so he said that he was downstairs
[23:06] holding daisy and she just starts
[23:08] barking at the couch like crazy just out
[23:10] of the couch and a hairstyle
[23:12] stand up on her back and she's just
[23:13] barking going crazy
[23:15] and um he said that he sets her down and
[23:18] she's just kind of circling the couch
[23:19] like barking just looking at the couch
[23:22] so he says he gets close to that spot
[23:24] and the presence of god
[23:26] is just so strong there so i don't know
[23:28] if my dog saw like an angel appeal if i
[23:30] don't know what she saw but
[23:32] the spirit of god was in that room
[23:35] but um
[23:39] uh since then i've been pressing onto
[23:42] the christian
[23:43] and seeking more and more revelation and
[23:46] i was also gifted by god
[23:48] by something not many people have the
[23:50] opportunity to be to be gifted with and
[23:52] that's
[23:53] parents that pray for me and uh
[23:56] press through and pray for my salvation
[23:59] because i probably won't be standing
[24:01] here giving this testimony if it wasn't
[24:02] for them
[24:04] they're probably pretty relieved right
[24:06] now but
[24:07] yeah anyways thank you that's my
[24:16] testimony
[24:27] that dog saw a ghost the holy ghost
[24:32] man you you need that yeah you get all
[24:36] excited and you
[24:37] lose your face mask you're welcome
[24:42] all right now who's next
[24:47] who's next hey man who's next the door's
[24:50] open
[24:53] amen goodness what a testimony now i'll
[24:56] tell you something else that was um
[25:01] sunday afternoon when he was going home
[25:03] right yeah
[25:05] so brother trevor comes to the house
[25:07] sunday night and i think he
[25:08] before even he talked to bob on monday
[25:10] morning and he kind of was
[25:12] um he wasn't
[25:16] yeah he kind of was it was a little
[25:18] dejected that
[25:19] that there wasn't as much participation
[25:22] the second service
[25:24] and um i i told him i said well look
[25:27] we're just a cautious bunch of people
[25:28] you know we're taught to be cautious
[25:30] that's the only thing i could say
[25:31] because some of y'all sit there
[25:32] like your stone face and you know he
[25:34] said i didn't know what anybody was
[25:36] getting or doing or anything he said i
[25:38] just felt like it was you you no you
[25:39] didn't say useless but
[25:41] you know i just didn't feel like
[25:42] anything came about and
[25:44] of course i didn't know about it that
[25:47] esther had
[25:48] that that had happened to sister esther
[25:49] on the way back home
[25:51] from his testimony that he had testified
[25:54] and and i'm kind of like bob when he was
[25:57] when he was at my house i'm like man
[25:59] look
[26:00] there's a purpose for everything you're
[26:03] not gonna get
[26:04] i know for a fact that today with 90
[26:07] people in the building downstairs and
[26:09] upstairs
[26:10] maybe 30 of you are going to get
[26:13] something
[26:14] you got to decide which dirty you are
[26:17] because the rest are going to you know
[26:18] they're going to work on their tractor
[26:19] or they're going to
[26:20] you know be cutting grass or something
[26:23] in their mind and waiting for tomorrow
[26:24] to get here and i'm talking about holy
[26:26] ghost filled people too i'm not talking
[26:27] about just people that just don't care
[26:29] okay because that's the diversity of our
[26:32] mind
[26:33] that things happen not saying good or
[26:35] bad but i'm just saying that
[26:36] i told brother trevor and i i'll you
[26:38] know i've been trying to talk to the
[26:40] ministers when i was a young guy well i
[26:42] wasn't young when i started ministering
[26:44] but i was young in the lord
[26:46] if you if you base everything on the
[26:48] response of a congregation
[26:50] you're going to be sorely disappointed
[26:53] right but brother dale said told me a
[26:57] long time ago he said
[26:58] and he's told you he preaches to your
[27:00] soul
[27:02] so your soul whether you're sitting
[27:03] there asleep or not
[27:08] maybe getting something subliminally
[27:11] like we were talking about through that
[27:12] fourth dimension but
[27:13] but i don't i told him i said bro trevor
[27:15] if you keep basing your
[27:17] um your success on feelings and emotions
[27:20] and then i took him back to where
[27:21] luis um you know he's got the uh
[27:24] ten thousand worlds brother brown said
[27:26] one soul
[27:28] one saul and brother trevor brought up
[27:31] the
[27:31] um instance where brother rhino said he
[27:34] went to do a meeting and he said
[27:36] he said i got the lamb that i was
[27:37] looking for last night
[27:39] but he didn't discontinue the service
[27:41] i'm sure those other people got healed
[27:42] and other people got saved
[27:44] but the one you come for may just be one
[27:46] so brother trevor and i uh
[27:48] brother bob and i talked monday and and
[27:50] he made a good point he said brother
[27:51] trevor he said once you preach a word he
[27:53] said
[27:53] the bible said it will not return void
[27:56] it will accomplish whether you think see
[27:58] where our expectation has got a slide
[28:00] rule you know we we
[28:02] think wow boy since the i've been in
[28:04] congregations to where the people were
[28:05] shouting speaking in tongues
[28:06] running the aisles and did not know what
[28:08] the preacher was talking about
[28:10] amen amen
[28:14] so what i mean what'd you get the man
[28:17] was bringing the word of god and you
[28:18] were you know
[28:19] blowing it out not you not our
[28:21] congregation that's for sure
[28:22] a lot of congregations blowing it out
[28:24] the whistle and not listening to what's
[28:25] being said
[28:26] but see brother trevor could have come
[28:27] down here the whole weekend we enjoyed
[28:29] both
[28:30] services both services were good and
[28:32] enjoyed his fellowship for a couple of
[28:34] days and he got to fellowship with
[28:35] brother bob bro luis and
[28:36] brother joe and and their families
[28:38] because they've got big message families
[28:40] and they can congregate together and
[28:43] bring a crowd with them when they come
[28:45] but he just came for one person
[28:49] now whether you got something out of
[28:51] it's your deal
[28:53] but he came the word
[28:56] the word in flesh came to get esther
[28:58] black
[29:00] not discluding anybody but she received
[29:03] what it
[29:04] what came and and you know what 10 000
[29:07] worlds
[29:09] you can't buy what she got just by a
[29:11] testimony
[29:12] sunday you can't buy it with money no
[29:15] money in the world can ever buy that
[29:18] so you know what if you think ministers
[29:21] or even some of you that speak to people
[29:23] if you tell them the word it will never
[29:26] return void
[29:26] it will accomplish what it set out to
[29:29] accomplish
[29:30] it may it's not going to accomplish
[29:32] empty in hospitals it's not going to
[29:33] accomplish saving everybody in the
[29:34] building that would be wonderful
[29:36] but it gets what one here one here
[29:39] that's what we're in now we're in the
[29:40] gleaning part
[29:41] we're in the we're in the cutting of the
[29:43] corners or getting the corners like ruth
[29:46] she's getting they're leaving little
[29:47] handful of god's leaving little hands
[29:48] full of purpose for one lady
[29:52] ruth to get enough barley
[29:55] to sustain her in her life so that's
[29:58] what we're getting now and i
[30:00] i just want us to realize that that it's
[30:01] not uh it's not always the
[30:04] this was successful and this was not
[30:08] preach the gospel if you preach the
[30:11] gospel
[30:12] higher low slow or fast if it saves one
[30:15] soul
[30:17] it's worth everything that any any
[30:19] effort
[30:20] that we do studying and preaching and
[30:23] and
[30:23] laboring and what brother dale's been
[30:25] doing lord for 50 years now
[30:27] almost or longer is
[30:30] getting the people ready for for a body
[30:33] change
[30:34] but it also catches the fish too and and
[30:37] as brother branham
[30:38] you saw on the this morning he was
[30:40] talking about you know throwing the net
[30:41] out
[30:42] he catches the fish along with the frogs
[30:44] and the snakes and everything else but
[30:47] everybody goes where they're supposed to
[30:48] go though the fish you know
[30:50] are there to be eat so thank god for
[30:53] sister esther for you
[30:54] for your testimony and um remember
[30:57] wednesday night brother aaron will be
[30:58] speaking
[30:59] also next sunday i'll be in arizona
[31:02] leaving friday until
[31:04] tuesday we're coming back so we're going
[31:05] to spend some time with brother chris
[31:07] and
[31:07] sister joanna and so bob will be taking
[31:09] second service brother they'll be taking
[31:11] first service next sunday
[31:13] and god bless our brother and sister and
[31:15] their family from chile that was a
[31:16] wonderful
[31:17] wonderful um they just have a musical a
[31:20] whole musical church and
[31:22] and uh you know
[31:26] where's louise louise in there tickets
[31:28] are 750 dollars
[31:32] to go to santiago it's 100 yeah i just
[31:34] looked at that
[31:35] okay you want to go okay again
[31:39] we could drive down there if we could
[31:40] get across that sue i mean not suez
[31:42] canal but
[31:43] the canal we could get across that canal
[31:44] we could go but we can't do that it'd be
[31:46] a long drive
[31:48] their country is 3 000 miles long and
[31:50] 200 miles wide
[31:53] it's desert in the top and they got
[31:55] glaciers in the bottom so they have a
[31:57] very diverse
[31:59] country but you know what we all come
[32:01] from one family
[32:03] the family of god and he knew they'd be
[32:05] chileans he knew they'd be americans he
[32:07] knew they'd be all different kinds
[32:09] and so that's why he loves diversity if
[32:11] you will let's turn our bibles to
[32:15] hebrews 9 11 and let's continue on and
[32:18] for the sake of
[32:19] of our brother and sister being here
[32:20] we're going to kind of back up just a
[32:22] little bit
[32:23] and slow down maybe a little bit
[32:27] i doubt it but we've been talking on
[32:30] speaking on eternal redemption and i
[32:33] hope you're getting something from this
[32:35] because
[32:36] that this thing goes on you're going to
[32:39] be talking about this and you say well
[32:41] boy it's just
[32:42] you know when we carry on a conversation
[32:43] here when we carry on a
[32:45] a church service or a conversation with
[32:48] people
[32:48] you know it goes so far and then it just
[32:50] kind of dwindles off because you just
[32:52] you you get you got something to talk
[32:55] about
[32:56] and then all of a sudden you've already
[32:57] talked about all that so
[32:59] it it dwindles down to where just uh and
[33:01] uh and uh well how about the weather you
[33:03] know you change the subject
[33:04] but not with this eternal redemption
[33:06] because eternal redemption is going to
[33:08] continue to go on
[33:09] it's not going to wane don't tell me
[33:11] anywhere in god's word that you're going
[33:13] to start right here
[33:14] and then you're going down no you're
[33:16] going to start here and you're just
[33:17] going to see more as you go
[33:19] and man it's going to expand by
[33:20] revelation even when we get across on
[33:23] the other side
[33:24] it's going to expand by revelation
[33:28] of all these great things that god has
[33:29] for us so let's bow our heads we've had
[33:31] a wonderful time today
[33:33] and uh we want to try to
[33:36] try to get on with this and get to get
[33:38] to something maybe
[33:41] because i like this word there's a word
[33:42] in the bible that i love
[33:44] more than well about more than any word
[33:46] in the bible it's called immortality
[33:50] immortality because see that sums up
[33:53] everything
[33:54] immortality you can put everything in
[33:56] there from from what we're talking about
[33:58] from
[33:59] eternal redemption all the way to the
[34:00] future home
[34:02] immortality paul says what
[34:08] abolish death and brought life and
[34:09] immortality to light
[34:12] to the gospel down here we know we're
[34:15] going to be eternal up there
[34:16] immortal but we're going to become
[34:18] immortal down here the bible tells us
[34:20] amen that would be that seventh
[34:22] dimension and we may not get to it today
[34:24] but we'll
[34:25] try our best so let's bow our heads lord
[34:28] thank you number one lord for being here
[34:29] with us
[34:31] and also thank you for bringing our
[34:33] sister lord into the family of god by
[34:35] the new birth
[34:37] lord what a it's an oddity now
[34:42] in the end time for a young person to
[34:44] say they get the new birth
[34:47] because satan has given everything in
[34:49] the world
[34:50] in their way to try to keep them from
[34:53] you
[34:54] but father thank god the foolishness of
[34:56] preaching
[34:58] that a fivefold ministry can open up a
[35:02] heart
[35:04] and lord pour your love down in the
[35:05] heart of an individual
[35:07] not even realizing what you're doing as
[35:09] a as a minister
[35:10] or someone testifying but lord when you
[35:13] go to working on their heart
[35:15] lord that's something we cannot do we
[35:17] can only produce the word to
[35:19] in front of them and lord that's what
[35:21] we're doing today let
[35:22] help us to present the word in front of
[35:24] the people so that they can receive lord
[35:27] but father let us not be judged by it
[35:29] let us let us take this lord and
[35:32] let it be something that we hold true in
[35:34] our heart
[35:36] and it will become part of us lord we
[35:38] pray that you'd just be with our
[35:39] brother and sister and family from chile
[35:41] lord we pray that you'd be with them as
[35:42] they journey back
[35:44] lord to their home knowing that it's a
[35:45] temporary home ours is a temporary home
[35:48] here but lord we'll all be together
[35:51] around the throne with you father not
[35:53] too
[35:54] many days from now forgive us of our
[35:57] sins bless this
[35:58] day take care of us lord be with us ones
[36:00] that are sick
[36:01] the ones that were that brother joe
[36:03] there is creating the list for
[36:04] to pray for lord we just pray that the
[36:07] list will get shorter and not longer
[36:09] father
[36:10] we know that you're a healing god and on
[36:12] time god
[36:14] and you sure are a salvation god
[36:17] lord thank you for these things in jesus
[36:19] name
[36:20] amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being
[36:24] come a high priest of good things to
[36:26] come by a greater and more perfect
[36:27] tabernacle not made with hands that is
[36:29] to say
[36:30] not of this building neither by the
[36:32] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[36:34] blood he entered into
[36:35] in once into the holy place having
[36:38] obtained
[36:40] eternal redemption for us you may be
[36:43] seated in the lord as blessing
[36:45] to the reading of the word obtained
[36:47] eternal redemption
[36:48] for us and as we were talking the other
[36:52] wednesday night listen for god to have a
[36:54] plan
[36:55] and for there be to be redemption number
[36:58] one
[36:59] someone had to fall but it had to be a
[37:01] group of people it had to be someone it
[37:03] had to be people not animals and plants
[37:06] and all these different things
[37:07] we know they fell because of what a
[37:09] human
[37:10] did they did not fall of their own self
[37:14] amen it was human being someone with a
[37:17] soul that's why brother louise there
[37:20] with the
[37:21] the quote of brother branham saying and
[37:22] he could only a prophet could look down
[37:24] and say
[37:25] your soul's worth ten thousand worlds
[37:28] how could you put a price on that
[37:30] you can't put a price on it one soul
[37:32] coming to god
[37:34] is worth more than 10 000
[37:37] and look at the economy look at look at
[37:38] this world what we have
[37:41] in in in resources and all that 10 000
[37:44] of those
[37:45] one soul is worth 10 000 worlds
[37:49] but to obtain eternal redemption for us
[37:51] that's what made that property
[37:53] become so valuable because god came down
[37:56] in human flesh
[37:58] and died didn't have to wanted to
[38:02] made himself not part of the plan but
[38:05] the plan
[38:06] he was the plan of redemption there's no
[38:08] other way to get redeemed the bible
[38:10] tells us there's no other way to receive
[38:12] jesus
[38:12] the other other way to receive this
[38:14] immortality
[38:15] except through the gospel and who is the
[38:17] gospel jesus christ he's the one that
[38:20] preached the gospel
[38:21] for three and a half years and that's
[38:22] what we got to work on
[38:24] we got three and a half listen we've had
[38:26] 60 years of listening to the prophet
[38:28] and he preached 30 years before that so
[38:30] we've had about 80 years of this great
[38:32] message being on the earth and what has
[38:33] it done
[38:35] what has he done we're still here
[38:39] like i said before he blasted those
[38:43] denominations he
[38:44] he tore him apart and not one church
[38:48] shut down
[38:49] not one organization said not we're
[38:51] going to quit our headquarters and we're
[38:52] going with this man no
[38:54] they just they've got more converts now
[38:56] to the to that false religion
[38:58] than they did when brother branham was
[39:00] here so you say well that didn't do any
[39:02] good
[39:03] he wasn't to them he was saying come out
[39:06] of her my people
[39:08] he was the one he wasn't in the
[39:10] denomination he was standing outside
[39:13] saying come out of her my people now as
[39:16] he was preaching he said the
[39:18] you know the the baptists were okay and
[39:20] the pentecostals were okay and
[39:21] and they were okay for their time billy
[39:24] graham i believe had the new birth for
[39:26] his time he had a place
[39:28] in the bible and that's what he came to
[39:30] and that's all he could come to
[39:32] amen nobody all right with that i mean
[39:34] he was directly
[39:35] um identified in the scripture by the
[39:38] prophet
[39:39] telling us who he was you say well he
[39:41] never accepted the message
[39:43] neither really did f f bosworth he was
[39:45] still a trinitarian
[39:47] all right so he didn't really come to
[39:50] the
[39:50] uh and it's not a concept this message
[39:53] is not a concept
[39:55] this message is reality this is exactly
[39:57] what jesus
[39:58] spoke when jesus was on earth this is
[40:01] exactly what he spoke
[40:04] he was not a denomination he didn't have
[40:06] a denominational idea he didn't have
[40:08] anything to do with
[40:10] what man has done to this eternal
[40:13] plan of redemption so if it's an eternal
[40:15] plan of redemption
[40:17] guess what never changes
[40:20] always the same never changes will not
[40:23] change
[40:24] and that's what we can depend on and as
[40:25] brother dale was speaking this morning
[40:28] you heard me amen more because look we
[40:30] don't have to go through judgment i've
[40:32] told you all that the great one of the
[40:33] greatest revelations that i got of this
[40:35] message is
[40:35] i don't have to stand a judgment i don't
[40:37] have to go through the tribulation
[40:39] period
[40:39] sure we're going to be whatever you want
[40:42] to call it physically bereft or have to
[40:44] i don't think we have to run for our
[40:46] life but i think maybe we're going to
[40:47] have to be like jesus christ was
[40:49] he you know just walk through a crowd
[40:51] and changed their vision and walked
[40:53] right on by
[40:54] amen
[40:58] now if y'all start going to sleep
[40:59] already
[41:02] i'm coming back here
[41:05] i'm going to stand among you well get me
[41:08] one of them big old
[41:09] whip thing listen
[41:14] this is huh what do you say
[41:18] yeah holy water yeah i listen brother i
[41:22] drowned some people
[41:24] because look hey when they like this
[41:28] you pour water in it would have to pray
[41:29] for them to raise them from the dead
[41:35] but you know what the problem is this
[41:38] has become common to us
[41:40] i'm looking at every one of you it's
[41:41] just become common i've already know
[41:43] this i've heard this for 50 years
[41:45] i've heard this for 20 years this thing
[41:47] you know this is just something we hear
[41:48] all the time
[41:49] and find something
[41:53] to rejoice about i rejoice that i don't
[41:57] have to go through the tribulation but
[41:58] you know what it's not just automatic i
[42:00] got to learn what's in this bible
[42:02] i got to let the holy ghost tell me why
[42:05] i'm not going to go through tribulation
[42:06] and tell me why i'm not going to go
[42:08] through the judgment
[42:09] cause i'm being judged right now
[42:12] and if you're being judged right now
[42:14] where do you stand
[42:18] number one phoenix arizona
[42:22] brother branham let's read the red says
[42:24] redemption is one of the oldest things
[42:25] in the bible
[42:27] did you know redemption was even before
[42:29] the plan of redemption was laid out
[42:31] before the world was ever formed
[42:33] think of that god foreseeing as brother
[42:35] dale's talking about this morning we've
[42:37] we're not beating this to death but i
[42:39] listen i want you to see
[42:40] that by foreknowledge this plan of god
[42:43] and we ever get to it listen this all
[42:46] originated from that seventh dimension
[42:48] that no one can go into but god himself
[42:51] but god allowed a prophet sure he
[42:53] allowed a prophet to go in the sixth
[42:54] dimension
[42:55] amen to see the the dead saints
[42:58] and he said where's jesus he's a little
[43:00] higher but now remember though
[43:02] when brother brown said let's go back
[43:04] into the back part of god's mind in
[43:06] christ the mystery of god reveal
[43:07] he took him into that seventh dimension
[43:10] that is god alone that's
[43:12] where his mind is that's where you can't
[43:14] and you can't make god just being a
[43:16] brain
[43:17] right right this is the mind of god
[43:20] if you're part of the word of god today
[43:22] if you're a born-again believer
[43:24] this is the peace or part of my of the
[43:26] mind of god
[43:27] that was before the foundation of the
[43:29] world thinking about this
[43:32] as it's being revealed so even look god
[43:36] foreseeing and making a way
[43:38] of redemption before he even made the
[43:40] world
[43:41] where god plainly says that christ was
[43:43] predestinated for ordained it was the
[43:45] lamb of god
[43:48] see he was the kingpin he was the one
[43:50] that he had to come and do that because
[43:51] nobody else could do it
[43:53] so he was predestinated eternally he
[43:55] knew he was going to have to die
[43:56] the plan just didn't develop when he got
[43:58] here like i told you many times before
[44:01] the
[44:01] the greatest quote that's an eye-opener
[44:03] in this message is that jesus did not
[44:05] come here
[44:06] to bring you an inheritance in other
[44:09] words he didn't develop an inheritance
[44:11] while he was here
[44:12] no your inheritance was before the
[44:14] foundation of the world
[44:16] and therefore christ had to come here in
[44:19] human flesh
[44:20] to fulfill what he already saw
[44:23] he'll be all right with that he
[44:25] fulfilled what he already saw
[44:28] in the back part of god's mind that mind
[44:31] you know you can't there's no way even
[44:34] though
[44:35] well you're too young well you're to
[44:37] roll somebody's mind
[44:39] bob
[44:44] he's fixing to be 46 years old 40 47
[44:48] 48 90. 46
[44:52] but still i need somebody in my in my
[44:54] grade level
[44:55] sorry you either buddy but you know we
[44:58] can
[44:59] we can the people that danny's closer
[45:02] than joyce she's way older than
[45:03] all of us but
[45:07] the way we grew up in our culture we
[45:09] understand things that went on
[45:10] you do the same thing like that brother
[45:12] dale tells about having to plow with the
[45:14] mew well how many of us have plowed with
[45:16] a mule
[45:18] one person so that's a generation
[45:21] but now we look at that and we say well
[45:24] that was a generation past
[45:25] but you know it had to be like that's
[45:28] why
[45:28] the analogy i'm using the eternal plan
[45:30] of redemption is god had already
[45:32] thought of this saw it develop because
[45:35] of foreknowledge
[45:36] and then he predetermined as trevor was
[45:39] talking about sunday
[45:40] there's a predetermining of each church
[45:42] age now remember
[45:44] those church ages there was a a city
[45:47] built
[45:48] that had the character of the church age
[45:52] but none of those people were the
[45:54] believers of that age does everybody
[45:55] understand what i'm saying
[45:57] in other words laodicea was a city back
[45:59] in
[46:00] whatever it was a.d something okay
[46:04] but none of us were there but the
[46:06] characteristics of that age
[46:09] of of our age was parallel to that
[46:13] city's
[46:13] characteristic so you know what god's
[46:15] doing he's saying look
[46:16] i had this i saw what they were going to
[46:18] do and i knew they were going to be this
[46:20] way and that's the layout to see an age
[46:22] and this over here is going to be the
[46:23] ephesian age and you know what that was
[46:25] the age that we didn't have a tractor
[46:26] that we were going to plow with we
[46:28] plowed with a mule now
[46:30] we got these great big things that could
[46:31] just hey they've got things that just
[46:33] take this
[46:34] building in about 15 minutes and flatten
[46:36] it to the ground
[46:37] you couldn't do that 100 years ago never
[46:42] what are you saying brother by the
[46:44] advancement of man you see the
[46:46] advancement of god
[46:47] as we were looking at the countdown we
[46:49] see a couple of quotes here on the
[46:50] fourth dimension
[46:51] we were talking about that on the
[46:53] countdown brother branham brings it
[46:55] and we'll read it again if we get a
[46:56] little further he comes to a place and
[46:58] he says
[46:59] we've had an astronaut now
[47:03] we got an astronaut now that has went
[47:06] out
[47:08] to outer space and has come back and
[47:11] told us
[47:12] you know what he was telling us
[47:15] he the prophet of god
[47:19] was able to go into that sixth dimension
[47:21] see what was in there
[47:23] and be able to come back here and say
[47:25] hey
[47:26] there's more out there's more out there
[47:30] and he came to say look there's more in
[47:32] here
[47:34] way more in here than we haven't even
[47:38] touched now brother dale read ephesians
[47:40] 1 so we're not going to read it again
[47:42] because he says according he has chosen
[47:44] us in him before the foundation of the
[47:46] world
[47:47] not chosen by him but for him and
[47:50] in him before the foundation of the
[47:53] world
[47:53] all right now look at verse 11 and whom
[47:55] also we obtain an inheritance because
[47:57] see you have to
[47:58] you have to take hold of that
[48:00] inheritance yourself
[48:03] now see sister astra was taught
[48:06] that if you don't if you're not born
[48:08] again hey sister i mean
[48:13] if you're not born again you're lost
[48:15] that's it
[48:16] period you're lost right
[48:19] there's no in-between you're either born
[48:22] again
[48:23] or you're in the process but still being
[48:25] in the process
[48:26] you're not part of the family of god
[48:27] unless you have the baptism of the holy
[48:29] ghost in your soul
[48:31] all right so sister esther had to obtain
[48:34] her inheritance
[48:36] now remember in the mind of god
[48:39] she already had the inheritance
[48:42] in the mind of god like i said before if
[48:45] you read
[48:46] if you read quotes and you can't keep
[48:48] those two separate
[48:51] you get confused that's right because he
[48:53] always was you always were an eagle you
[48:55] always were this
[48:56] that's in the mind of god listen i've
[48:58] read you so how many quotes have i read
[48:59] you
[49:00] you were born a cuckold cuckleber and i
[49:03] don't know if you have those in chile or
[49:04] not do you have a cuckoo bird in chile
[49:06] a sticker how would you say it louise
[49:10] something that sticks you or something a
[49:11] thorn or something like that
[49:13] you were born a thorn you were born that
[49:16] way you were born contrary to god
[49:19] so you had to look and also we have
[49:22] obtained an
[49:22] inheritance what being predestinated
[49:27] according to the purpose of him who
[49:29] worketh all things after the council
[49:32] of his own will and what is his will his
[49:33] will is his word
[49:35] all right so he did that by foreign
[49:36] knowledge we're just going to skip to a
[49:38] lot of this but let's go to number three
[49:40] and we'll read what the prophet said
[49:41] about being a kuckleberg
[49:46] so but realize if you read the quotes
[49:48] you read all the quotes from brother
[49:49] brown so you always were a wheat
[49:51] you all you came here already eternal
[49:53] you know all these things
[49:54] you have to listen to what he's saying
[49:56] right
[49:58] and the mind of god is already set right
[50:01] down here
[50:02] we are on free moral agency this
[50:05] is free moral agency for everybody so
[50:08] you have to obtain that inheritance
[50:11] but he saw that you would obtain it he
[50:14] saw that last sunday that
[50:15] sister esther had had enough and and
[50:18] look at brother zai
[50:19] you know all the different ones that you
[50:21] have those up and down i mean you know
[50:22] still as a christian we have up and
[50:24] downs
[50:24] but there's not so far up
[50:28] or they're not so far down we have
[50:31] little wiggles
[50:32] in christianity right amen
[50:36] we still have our problems but now when
[50:39] you do when you're up here and you say
[50:41] oh i got it i got it and then the next
[50:42] day you're cursing like a sailor
[50:46] you ain't got it now when you ma
[50:49] when one may run through your mind cause
[50:53] you can't help it that's god's
[50:54] playground
[50:55] and that is the devil's playground but
[50:58] you might have those days where you
[51:00] might want to say it
[51:02] but there's something inside of you that
[51:03] says nope
[51:05] you don't say that i don't do that
[51:06] anymore we've all experienced that
[51:09] amen we've all experienced we all still
[51:12] have the same
[51:13] memories and conscious effects and
[51:14] imagination and we still we still have
[51:16] that same recorder that's been playing
[51:18] since we were a young child
[51:20] right that we wish we would forget what
[51:22] we did
[51:24] but you know what god left that there
[51:26] for a purpose
[51:28] he left that there so that you can every
[51:31] day
[51:32] say father forgive me
[51:35] now listen don't ask for forgiveness for
[51:36] what you did 20 years ago if you've
[51:38] already asked forgiveness
[51:40] you're just wasting your time in god's
[51:41] too
[51:44] because he's going to say what you're
[51:45] talking about because if it's been put
[51:47] in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[51:48] brother brown said if it's been placed
[51:50] under the blood
[51:51] no one can bring it out not even god
[51:53] right
[51:54] thank god god can't bring it back up
[51:58] but now we had to come to a condition as
[52:01] sister esther says she's been up she'd
[52:02] been down she's been this she's been
[52:04] that
[52:04] zach was the same way i was the same way
[52:06] i just used that because he's right here
[52:07] in the front like brother trevor said
[52:08] i'm gonna talk about you because you're
[52:09] sitting on the front row
[52:11] all right but you did the same thing
[52:14] that's your testimony though
[52:16] what if you just what if we did just
[52:17] come into this world i may not get to
[52:19] nothing but
[52:19] we're going to talk about this for a
[52:20] minute we may we come into this world
[52:23] to have a testimony because the plan of
[52:27] redemption hinges on
[52:31] me because if i don't accept it i'm not
[52:34] in the plan
[52:36] amen but if i accept it and become part
[52:40] of the plan
[52:41] then now see that's the mind of god that
[52:44] knew
[52:46] i don't listen i didn't know that one
[52:48] day zach would walk in the
[52:50] in the brothers act would walk in the
[52:52] door walk in the room and have a
[52:54] powerful testimony
[52:57] and then you know brother trevor if he
[52:59] sees this i
[53:00] he didn't tell me not to say nothing
[53:01] about it but he said he was just having
[53:04] a struggle sunday afternoon
[53:05] i said join the crowd
[53:09] all right join the crowd
[53:13] but when he went home he just felt real
[53:15] dejected
[53:17] went home talked to bob but the next
[53:18] monday same same conversation
[53:21] i said don't worry don't let that bother
[53:23] you if you listen
[53:25] if you walk out that door
[53:29] and i'm telling you this is this is
[53:31] something that you should do even in
[53:32] your
[53:33] personal life before you walk out that
[53:35] door before i come out that door i go
[53:37] right over there you know what the first
[53:38] person i see because there's a big old
[53:40] full
[53:40] mirror right here behind this door i
[53:43] look at that mirror and i say god
[53:45] though i be a castaway though i don't
[53:48] feel like preaching
[53:50] though you throw me in hell you give
[53:53] somebody
[53:53] something today now i don't go now lord
[53:55] give all 100 people give
[53:57] give them all a blessing now that'd be
[53:59] happy and that'd be real nice
[54:01] sometimes it might happen i hadn't seen
[54:03] it yet but
[54:04] i said lord though i don't feel like
[54:06] doing this
[54:07] that has nothing to do with it i've
[54:10] studied
[54:11] all week i've run things through my mind
[54:13] and i'm not and listen you don't run
[54:14] things through your mind
[54:16] we're just not going to get in our
[54:17] sermon i don't run things through my
[54:20] mind and say well now
[54:22] now sister christine i know she's got
[54:24] this problem i can see it in the face
[54:27] and i can see it in the way she acts so
[54:29] i'm going to try to preach something
[54:30] that'll just help
[54:31] you can't do that that's right listen as
[54:34] i said before i told some of the young
[54:36] ministers you can't make something
[54:38] happen
[54:39] when you you that's the worst part
[54:43] when you say you or i
[54:47] i'm gonna make something happen this
[54:48] service boy i guarantee you they ain't
[54:50] nobody going to sleep today i'm going to
[54:52] have a message
[54:53] that's going to fire him up
[54:56] i don't know how you translated that
[54:59] it's going to fire him up and then it's
[55:02] just like
[55:04] you ever went down the road and had two
[55:05] flat tires
[55:12] right but you know what you don't let
[55:15] that bother you though
[55:17] because i've prepared all week something
[55:20] doesn't matter if it's just a few words
[55:21] how many times have i told you you're
[55:23] not going to get this whole hour sermon
[55:24] or hour and a half sermon or
[55:26] whatever it is you're going to get 15
[55:27] minutes of something compressed
[55:30] that you're going to get and say well
[55:32] that helped me how many times ministers
[55:34] we know that you walk outside and people
[55:36] walk by you never say a word
[55:39] nobody says good sermon harley anymore
[55:42] so if it's not it's not that's okay just
[55:44] tell me it's not say i
[55:45] that wasn't good
[55:48] but water but you know one or two
[55:50] persons they'll they'll grab you
[55:53] they'll grab you and they'll say boy
[55:57] see if you had trevor here that day or
[55:59] the day after what you'd say hey brother
[56:01] boy that was for me
[56:05] and me only well you know what
[56:09] that would just change his whole
[56:10] attitude
[56:13] everybody got that same way i told you
[56:15] when we have visitors here that are not
[56:17] message believers
[56:18] how important is it that i keep telling
[56:20] you over and over again
[56:21] i don't care if you've ever said amen or
[56:22] raise your hand in your life
[56:24] that's your business between you and god
[56:27] but please while somebody when
[56:28] somebody's here are visiting and they're
[56:29] not
[56:30] part of they're not message believers
[56:31] and i know these people are message
[56:32] believers
[56:33] but we get people coming here and
[56:35] brother dale kind of
[56:36] got you know he'll move over and start
[56:38] you know talk about water baptism or
[56:40] one of us you know we'll weave it in
[56:41] there somewhere about water baptism and
[56:43] about um
[56:44] trinity the trinitarian doctrine and we
[56:46] just sit there asleep
[56:49] because you know what that person's
[56:50] doing that person is going
[56:52] that man's on an island by himself
[56:56] he must be the only person that believes
[56:57] it because all these other people are
[56:58] not saying anything
[57:06] i'm excited that god sent a prophet
[57:09] i'm excited that all the that all the
[57:12] world
[57:13] is contrary to what i believe
[57:17] what martin luther said he said he said
[57:19] i he said i want the world to know
[57:22] right yeah all the world don't like you
[57:25] martin
[57:25] i want the world to know that i don't
[57:27] like what the world's doing either
[57:31] that's right
[57:37] but does that affect are we so much
[57:40] cuckobers that we just sit there and
[57:42] don't
[57:42] don't have any reaction listen folks
[57:45] we're human being remember what brother
[57:46] brown said that time
[57:48] he saw brother ram i don't want anybody
[57:49] brag on me he said that guy was lying
[57:52] right and he didn't have no have to have
[57:55] no prophetic
[57:56] discernment to realize that we're human
[57:59] beings
[58:00] all of us are human beings right and you
[58:03] know
[58:04] yeah i'd rather donny to come back to me
[58:05] and say hey
[58:08] you need to preach that over again you
[58:09] didn't do a good job that time
[58:12] then for you to say good sermon and then
[58:14] go home and go i don't know what in the
[58:15] world he was saying today
[58:20] what's that got to do with eternal front
[58:21] of redemption i don't know but we'll get
[58:23] back to it in just a second
[58:25] let's look at number three questions and
[58:26] answers but look
[58:28] how can i take a cocker bar and make a
[58:30] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[58:33] for me to do it just what i said before
[58:36] quit trying to make things happen
[58:41] if you're if you're studying for
[58:43] something we're getting back into our
[58:44] sunday school class
[58:45] study for something for the kids and
[58:47] don't say when i think you know this is
[58:49] going to be for jonas this day
[58:53] no you've left the whole class out or
[58:56] this is just for brother donny today
[58:58] or no you know what if you got the holy
[59:01] ghost and they got the holy ghost or
[59:03] even if they don't have the holy ghost
[59:04] in the congregation
[59:05] if they have a need and they need
[59:06] something then guess guess what god's
[59:08] going to do
[59:09] he's going to move you over
[59:12] right because we're only going to preach
[59:15] what you take
[59:19] amen that's why we like teaching and we
[59:21] don't have you know i didn't say
[59:23] i don't say we don't like the other
[59:24] things but we we like good teaching
[59:26] because
[59:26] what does teaching do teaching
[59:28] positionally places you in the body as
[59:30] brother dale's talking about
[59:32] going up to adopt to adoption to be
[59:34] placed
[59:36] when you see the the right of adoption
[59:39] watch what happens in galatians it says
[59:43] that you're under tutors and governors
[59:45] now how many of us have been
[59:47] school how many of us have been in
[59:49] school you know what school s-c-h-o-o-l
[59:51] school
[59:54] and we really enjoyed every day of it
[59:56] right
[59:59] especially some of us that was a little
[1:00:00] mischievous
[1:00:02] like sister kathy
[1:00:05] just kidding just kidding i'm sure she
[1:00:08] wouldn't
[1:00:10] but that's what god's saying i'm to take
[1:00:13] you to school
[1:00:15] and i'm going to give you school
[1:00:16] teachers
[1:00:18] school moms i'm going to give you
[1:00:20] principals
[1:00:22] now how many of us really liked going in
[1:00:24] the principal's office
[1:00:27] i didn't want to know that guy so it's
[1:00:30] the same way with god for us to go up
[1:00:32] this
[1:00:32] statue of a perfect man and get into
[1:00:33] this adoption that we're talking about
[1:00:35] which is part of the eternal plan of
[1:00:36] redemption
[1:00:37] amen it's part of the eternal plan of
[1:00:40] redemption because the eternal plan of
[1:00:41] redemption
[1:00:42] plan of redemption some group or even
[1:00:45] just
[1:00:45] one person has got to come to an
[1:00:47] adoption to wit the redemption of the
[1:00:49] body
[1:00:50] even if it's just one person but you
[1:00:52] know what if it's not me i don't want to
[1:00:54] stand in the way
[1:00:55] i want to rally behind whoever that is
[1:00:57] but you know what the first thing people
[1:00:59] do as human beings
[1:01:00] how many of you played king on the hill
[1:01:03] do they do that in chile they play king
[1:01:05] of the hill clint king of the hill i
[1:01:06] don't
[1:01:08] somebody's on the very top of the
[1:01:09] mountain and everybody wants that guy's
[1:01:10] job so they crawl up there and they
[1:01:12] throw him down and you get up there and
[1:01:13] you got to knock the next guy down
[1:01:16] that's the way it is a lot of times in
[1:01:17] in the message of the hour you know they
[1:01:19] all want to be number one
[1:01:23] i really don't care i think we're in the
[1:01:27] right message
[1:01:28] i don't think i know i know we're in the
[1:01:30] right message i know we're in the right
[1:01:32] place
[1:01:32] to hear what we need to hear i don't
[1:01:34] care who's on the hill
[1:01:37] if god put somebody on the hill you're
[1:01:39] not gonna knock him off anyway
[1:01:42] hey man if god places somebody you're
[1:01:44] not gonna knock them off
[1:01:46] same way with adoption i'm praying that
[1:01:48] somebody comes to that place
[1:01:52] are you well we don't have to worry
[1:01:55] about these viruses and have to wear a
[1:01:57] mask and after all this stuff
[1:01:59] there's going to come a place
[1:02:02] to where brother branham said we will
[1:02:05] speak and it'll be like
[1:02:06] popcorn popping pop pop pop in other
[1:02:09] words
[1:02:12] things are gonna happen but it's not
[1:02:14] gonna happen if we don't have the new
[1:02:15] birth number one
[1:02:16] and it's not gonna happen if we don't if
[1:02:18] we say well i always
[1:02:20] was this great thing see you've put
[1:02:21] yourself on top of the hill
[1:02:23] let god put you up there god's got you
[1:02:26] in his mind already up there
[1:02:29] you just don't know it that's why you
[1:02:30] and i that's why we preach the gospel we
[1:02:33] say
[1:02:33] boy we got we got old brother zach today
[1:02:35] you'll see his eyes he's
[1:02:37] and no so-and-so over here on this side
[1:02:39] of the church he's
[1:02:40] sound sleep well it might be the totally
[1:02:43] opposite because you know what you're
[1:02:44] not doing the work
[1:02:46] god's doing the work so you let god do
[1:02:49] the work
[1:02:50] right but how can i change take a
[1:02:52] huckleberry and make a grain of wheat
[1:02:54] you can't do that
[1:02:59] brother bob how many times have you
[1:03:01] tried to get your two oldest
[1:03:03] to be oh bro to be wheat
[1:03:06] i'm gonna y'all both got up here you
[1:03:09] you've been up
[1:03:10] i'm picking on you but you know what i'm
[1:03:13] proud of you
[1:03:14] that we can say you have become a wheat
[1:03:16] yes
[1:03:18] your mom and daddy tried to beat the
[1:03:19] kuckleberg out of you didn't he
[1:03:21] and mama maybe but really
[1:03:25] didn't i mean mama tried to save me for
[1:03:27] 30 years
[1:03:29] didn't happen because you can't do it
[1:03:33] you can pray but you know one day
[1:03:37] in 1998 it became possible
[1:03:42] by the transforming power of god
[1:03:45] to change me from my old kookaburra
[1:03:49] to the new creature in christ so see
[1:03:53] the mind of god that i always was weak
[1:03:57] manifested itself on earth just like the
[1:04:00] mind of god said i've got to go die and
[1:04:02] become the lamb's flame before the
[1:04:03] foundation of the world so i can cover
[1:04:05] everything and everybody but one day 2
[1:04:07] 000 years ago
[1:04:09] next week on sunday what we consider
[1:04:12] easter he produced what he saw before
[1:04:16] the foundation of the world
[1:04:19] and he had to wait for how old are you
[1:04:23] 18 never mind
[1:04:27] he had to wait some age of
[1:04:29] accountability maybe nine
[1:04:31] years on but you know what
[1:04:34] to god it was just like this he knew
[1:04:36] that but we're down here though
[1:04:38] mom and daddy's struggling mama's
[1:04:40] praying daddy's praying aunt and uncle's
[1:04:42] praying everybody's praying
[1:04:44] and god's going i know
[1:04:48] but you know sometimes he'll drop a seed
[1:04:50] in every once in a while he'll drop a
[1:04:51] word in there
[1:04:52] and it'll settle in you your you your
[1:04:55] parents heart
[1:04:57] that my kids are okay i mean they're not
[1:05:00] okay like they are
[1:05:02] but they're coming right amen
[1:05:05] but you need to realize that though that
[1:05:08] god will speak to you i told you this
[1:05:10] year
[1:05:11] please this year whatever you got inside
[1:05:13] of you
[1:05:15] and i mean that truthfully whatever you
[1:05:16] got inside of you you need to let it out
[1:05:20] good or bad see you let the bat out and
[1:05:23] let the good in
[1:05:25] that same way when you and i this year
[1:05:27] let that thing that's inside of you
[1:05:29] speak to you
[1:05:31] because it is the you are a part of the
[1:05:33] eternal plan of redemption
[1:05:35] sure you've still got a cuckold bear on
[1:05:36] the outside sure we get tired and we get
[1:05:39] frustrated but like i said before
[1:05:41] our ups and downs are not like the
[1:05:43] world's ups and downs folks
[1:05:47] like brother dale said this morning you
[1:05:48] better be know you've settled in god
[1:05:50] once you know you're settled in god
[1:05:51] death's not even gonna harm you
[1:05:54] oh yeah we have that little fog or cloud
[1:05:57] that we think well
[1:05:58] i don't want to leave my loved ones or
[1:06:00] uh you know i don't know what they're
[1:06:01] gonna do when i'm gone
[1:06:03] not up to you it's not up to you to pick
[1:06:06] your day
[1:06:07] god does but you know what you can keep
[1:06:09] pressing and keep pressing and keep
[1:06:11] pressing doesn't matter how old you get
[1:06:13] or how bad you feel you keep pressing
[1:06:15] and you're saying i'm going to be that
[1:06:16] one
[1:06:17] i'm going to be that one that's going to
[1:06:19] stand abraham
[1:06:21] said hey here i am lord i can't do it
[1:06:25] myself
[1:06:26] i've done walked with you for 20
[1:06:28] something years i hadn't produced a
[1:06:30] child got worse as it is
[1:06:33] but now i've met you
[1:06:37] see esther met melchizedek
[1:06:40] last sunday and not that's
[1:06:43] not that flesh melchizedek you
[1:06:45] understand what i mean we we've been
[1:06:46] taught right
[1:06:47] it's not that melchizedek that milk has
[1:06:49] it couldn't save you but the theophany
[1:06:51] that was in that milk has it
[1:06:52] that met abraham it's the same
[1:06:54] melchizedek that came down in your house
[1:06:57] that your dog got scared of
[1:07:02] let nature proclaim let nature proclaim
[1:07:07] that god can come down into this
[1:07:08] dimension
[1:07:09] any time he wants to and he'll change
[1:07:11] you from a cuckover
[1:07:13] to a wheat and he's the only one who can
[1:07:15] do it
[1:07:20] what john say john said if this don't
[1:07:23] happen the rocks are going to cry out
[1:07:28] if you keep silent blew the church
[1:07:31] the rocks are going to cry out
[1:07:35] because there's been a life of wheat put
[1:07:37] in that kookaburra
[1:07:39] and the life of the kuckelber has been
[1:07:41] taken out
[1:07:46] thank god and he's the only one that can
[1:07:49] do it because you know what when god
[1:07:50] makes you a wheat
[1:07:51] satan cannot ever make you a huckleberry
[1:07:53] again
[1:07:55] he can never make you a huckleberry
[1:07:57] again he can
[1:07:58] pound on you he can beat on you he can
[1:08:01] beat on that shell that you got on the
[1:08:03] outside
[1:08:04] but he'll never ever for an eternity
[1:08:08] touch your soul he takes his greasy
[1:08:11] hands off of you
[1:08:15] can't make you go in the fifth dimension
[1:08:23] that's what gets me about people
[1:08:26] you see what you got inside of you by
[1:08:29] the new birth
[1:08:30] you got a free ticket to glory
[1:08:34] but if you do have to pass away and
[1:08:35] you're laying on your deathbed
[1:08:38] everybody worries about that death angel
[1:08:42] i don't worry about it
[1:08:46] what's coming to get me is not a black
[1:08:48] guy
[1:08:49] in a robe that they proclaim that he's
[1:08:52] got a skeleton and he says i'm coming to
[1:08:54] get you
[1:08:56] no no no no that's not what's gonna
[1:09:00] happen
[1:09:01] god's gonna send the angels and he
[1:09:04] they're going to walk in
[1:09:06] and they're going to say no death angel
[1:09:09] you need to turn around and go back to
[1:09:10] where you're going
[1:09:11] they know death in this guy you may take
[1:09:13] that to the grave
[1:09:14] but we're going to a place that you know
[1:09:16] what when they step into that faster
[1:09:17] dimension
[1:09:18] satan don't even know he doesn't know
[1:09:20] anything about that
[1:09:22] he ain't got his greasy hands in that
[1:09:24] now listen i don't
[1:09:26] i don't see how but he can go in the
[1:09:28] seventh dimension where god is
[1:09:30] and talk to him remember that we know
[1:09:33] that he's the accuser of the brethren so
[1:09:34] he goes up and talks to god
[1:09:36] but that sixth dimension brother bob he
[1:09:38] can never
[1:09:39] i don't think he even knows where it's
[1:09:41] at
[1:09:42] i don't think he's privileged to even
[1:09:44] see in that dimension
[1:09:46] i'm sure one day in 1960 he was standing
[1:09:49] there
[1:09:49] in the fourth dimension scratching his
[1:09:51] head going why is this man laying on the
[1:09:54] bed
[1:09:55] and i can't see a soul nowhere
[1:10:00] hello
[1:10:03] there's a man laying here i see the
[1:10:05] huckleberry
[1:10:07] but where's his soul well god just
[1:10:11] slipped him over into another dimension
[1:10:14] and let him see the saints didn't have
[1:10:16] to worry about the devil the devil
[1:10:18] wasn't
[1:10:18] sniffing at his heels
[1:10:22] but he knew if he went back and got in
[1:10:23] that body
[1:10:25] the devil would be sniffing at his heels
[1:10:27] again
[1:10:28] but not when he was in the sixth
[1:10:30] dimension so in the sixth dimension
[1:10:32] is where we go if we have to pass away
[1:10:36] so let's skip to that real quick right
[1:10:37] there because we talked about paradise
[1:10:40] and i want to cover this
[1:10:41] you all know we went through the first
[1:10:43] the four dimensions the fourth dimension
[1:10:44] being
[1:10:45] radio waves and all these different
[1:10:46] things and then we talked about the
[1:10:48] fifth dimension which is
[1:10:49] the sin or dead which they're not
[1:10:51] burning in hell they're they're not they
[1:10:53] have not been judged yet they have just
[1:10:54] been caught in a place that they can't
[1:10:56] go to heaven
[1:10:57] or go to the sixth dimension and they
[1:10:59] can't come back here to the earth they
[1:11:00] have to go to a place of holding
[1:11:03] that's like a nightmare that you can't
[1:11:04] wake up from in the fifth th that's the
[1:11:06] fifth dimension everybody got that saved
[1:11:07] man
[1:11:09] kind of strange there was a there was a
[1:11:11] group called the fifth dimension
[1:11:14] remember brother claude preaching on
[1:11:15] that and they saw they they sang the age
[1:11:17] of aquarius
[1:11:19] which is the water boy or the man the
[1:11:20] son of man kind of interesting you know
[1:11:22] what the devil though
[1:11:24] the devil feels all these religious
[1:11:25] things and he perverts them and make
[1:11:27] them out in the world
[1:11:28] like trevor was talking about sunday
[1:11:30] about all these superheroes where they
[1:11:32] get all that from where they get
[1:11:33] superman
[1:11:34] and that's totally it ain't gonna happen
[1:11:38] right but the devil wants you to think
[1:11:40] it can happen on the earth
[1:11:42] that there's some little there's some
[1:11:44] you can get bit by
[1:11:45] um sorry electronic get bit by
[1:11:48] um a spider that's been in come on
[1:11:52] people
[1:11:53] you see how all this superman you know
[1:11:55] he comes from kryptonite and he does it
[1:11:57] i mean he comes from krypton and
[1:11:59] kryptonite's the one that bothers him
[1:12:02] see what the devil's doing he's
[1:12:03] diverting everybody's attention to that
[1:12:05] and it's not even real
[1:12:07] right right not even real but it seems
[1:12:10] real to the people that are like oh man
[1:12:11] he
[1:12:12] he died yesterday and come back to life
[1:12:16] or he conquered the world or he he moved
[1:12:19] the mountain
[1:12:22] well i thought that was left for us to
[1:12:23] do
[1:12:25] i thought that was a christian could say
[1:12:27] by the bible
[1:12:28] that if you have the grain of a mustard
[1:12:30] seed that you can have enough faith to
[1:12:31] move a mountain
[1:12:34] one grain of mustard seed you don't have
[1:12:36] to have your planet explode
[1:12:39] or or a or a spider about you that's
[1:12:42] been
[1:12:43] i can't remember where oh radiation
[1:12:47] a radioactive spider has bit you and now
[1:12:50] you can
[1:12:50] shoot things from you know whatever you
[1:12:53] see how satan knows wanting to change
[1:12:55] i was thinking about that when he was
[1:12:56] saying satan's wanting to change all
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:58] unreal to real
[1:13:02] unreal to the real and then seeing and
[1:13:04] they become a god in the movie industry
[1:13:06] because they can kill a guy and bring
[1:13:08] him back to life and
[1:13:09] they can have him disappear and reappear
[1:13:11] and they can have him walk through walls
[1:13:12] you see what he's doing
[1:13:14] but he's doing it though because there's
[1:13:16] a fourth dimension that he can work
[1:13:18] through right
[1:13:22] he's a fourth dimension that he can work
[1:13:23] through then we talk about the fifth
[1:13:25] dimension which was
[1:13:26] hell but not burning then we got to the
[1:13:29] sixth dimension so let's
[1:13:30] if y'all skip to that one we'll go to
[1:13:32] that one and then we'll
[1:13:33] not be real long today i want to read a
[1:13:36] real long quote here in a minute but
[1:13:38] everybody all right
[1:13:42] the sixth dimension on the countdown
[1:13:44] brother brown says now the sixth
[1:13:45] dimension is christ the saints dead
[1:13:47] saints or resting saints
[1:13:49] who is completely work finished on earth
[1:13:53] you see i don't want to be here for god
[1:13:54] if god's finished with any of us
[1:13:57] we want to go you pray for 15 more years
[1:14:01] you'll be like who was it you died
[1:14:03] he just made him he just made a mess of
[1:14:06] the last 15 years that god gave me
[1:14:07] but he wasn't ready to die is what his
[1:14:09] problem was
[1:14:11] he wanted to stay alive
[1:14:15] what oh work finished on earth and has
[1:14:18] entered into rest with christ
[1:14:20] under the altar beautifully you could
[1:14:22] parallel it like a wonderful dream now
[1:14:24] you paralleled the other one like a
[1:14:26] like another like a dream you didn't
[1:14:27] want to
[1:14:29] go to the fifth dimension to a dreamlike
[1:14:31] place the sixth dimension but he said
[1:14:33] look
[1:14:33] it's a wonderful dream that you don't
[1:14:35] want to wake up from it ain't a dream
[1:14:38] it's natural it's real but i'm just
[1:14:40] making a parable for you of course the
[1:14:42] seventh dimension
[1:14:43] is god alone now i want to clear up
[1:14:45] something real quick we talk about
[1:14:46] paradise and we talk about the dead
[1:14:48] saints
[1:14:49] raising and i want to tell you just like
[1:14:51] brother branham tells us
[1:14:53] somebody asked him where enoch was he
[1:14:54] said i'm going to tell you i don't know
[1:14:59] that's what he said i don't know and if
[1:15:01] he didn't know
[1:15:02] i sure ain't going to know but if he
[1:15:05] would
[1:15:05] if he was supposed to know and tell us
[1:15:08] and it become a part of the
[1:15:10] message of the hour god would have sent
[1:15:13] it
[1:15:14] i'm going to tell you folks brother
[1:15:17] adam's message did not
[1:15:18] leave stuff out we'll see a lot of
[1:15:20] people say well there was a lot left out
[1:15:22] and we got to fill it in hogwash
[1:15:26] baloney baloney because
[1:15:30] rapturing faith lies in the books and
[1:15:32] tape so what we got to do is
[1:15:34] is we got to get it out of there and
[1:15:36] present it to the people
[1:15:37] the way that it's supposed to be
[1:15:38] presented by the fifo ministry to
[1:15:41] perfect the saints
[1:15:43] just as the bible tells us but look
[1:15:47] whatever i'm going to read this
[1:15:48] scripture because some people say well
[1:15:51] some when the dead saints resurrected
[1:15:53] they come in their glorified bodies and
[1:15:57] listen we got some scriptures we got to
[1:15:58] deal with
[1:16:00] hebrews 11 40 says they without us
[1:16:02] cannot be made perfect
[1:16:04] now what is perfection to a to a
[1:16:07] believer it's not just your soul
[1:16:09] right am i okay it's not just your soul
[1:16:14] perfection in the believer is
[1:16:15] immortality
[1:16:17] which means you were mortal and now you
[1:16:19] are immortal
[1:16:21] everybody got that and i'm going to read
[1:16:23] you a scripture here in a few minutes
[1:16:25] where the bible says that
[1:16:26] that that he's the only one that's
[1:16:28] reached immortality
[1:16:30] so there's two scriptures that tells me
[1:16:32] one thing for sure the only
[1:16:34] person from adam to the
[1:16:37] to this day that's
[1:16:40] walking around in a glorified immortal
[1:16:43] body is jesus christ
[1:16:46] now there's others put in slots you've
[1:16:48] got um
[1:16:50] moses and elijah and you got enoch and
[1:16:52] those different ones
[1:16:53] is everybody okay with that but as we
[1:16:56] read this the people that came up from
[1:16:57] paradise
[1:16:58] they can't be in immortal bodies
[1:17:02] or you're breaking two scriptures
[1:17:06] why could brother branham not go to the
[1:17:07] seventh dimension
[1:17:11] because he had not become immortal yet
[1:17:15] the seventh dimension there's a man in
[1:17:17] that dimension that has
[1:17:18] come to this dimension died
[1:17:21] rose again ascended sent back to holy
[1:17:24] ghost
[1:17:26] amen but he is in another place because
[1:17:29] brother branham will read it when he
[1:17:30] went across the curtain of time he said
[1:17:32] where's jesus he said he's
[1:17:33] higher right you can't see him
[1:17:37] but when you get ready to come back to
[1:17:38] earth you're going to get he's going to
[1:17:40] judge you we'll read it
[1:17:42] you'll be gathered with your people
[1:17:44] remember paul wasn't in
[1:17:46] paul's in the sixth dimension no doubt
[1:17:47] but he wasn't in the dimension brother
[1:17:49] branham was in or he'd have seen him
[1:17:50] everybody got that we'll read it in a
[1:17:52] minute because why would brother brown
[1:17:54] say did paul make it well now
[1:17:56] if you're in a sixth dimension that's
[1:17:57] got millions of of people in it
[1:18:00] and and paul kind of got lost in the
[1:18:03] crowd somewhere over there no
[1:18:05] he's in a separate place because he said
[1:18:06] you'll be gathered with your people
[1:18:09] okay paul was gathered with his people
[1:18:11] irenaeus was gathered what
[1:18:13] not irene and it is irenaeus himself but
[1:18:16] it's irenius it's believers
[1:18:18] it's the ones that died under irena's
[1:18:20] message that's why you don't
[1:18:22] negate any church age messenger
[1:18:25] because they were all important they all
[1:18:26] brought one message from god
[1:18:29] and they were put in that slot when they
[1:18:31] died because listen
[1:18:35] i'm going to say this
[1:18:39] the dimension that those people are in
[1:18:40] now in the sixth dimension with brother
[1:18:42] branham sitting in there now
[1:18:43] they're a special group of people
[1:18:47] they got the last message of the hour
[1:18:50] they got they are it says bible says the
[1:18:53] last to be
[1:18:54] first and the first to be last so they
[1:18:56] are going to come up first
[1:19:00] and we which are alive and remain the
[1:19:02] bible says
[1:19:03] will never be alive and remain without
[1:19:06] what that prophet said that sitting in
[1:19:07] that sixth dimension
[1:19:09] right we're not going to get another
[1:19:11] messenger we're not going to get another
[1:19:12] great preacher to rise up somebody get
[1:19:14] up on the mountain again
[1:19:17] this is it we're all equal in the body
[1:19:21] of christ
[1:19:22] we have a five-fold ministry that has a
[1:19:24] special gift but there's no one special
[1:19:27] person anymore
[1:19:28] that we got to look to for our absolute
[1:19:32] amen so the sixth dimension then is a
[1:19:36] special place
[1:19:37] for the believers that died in christ
[1:19:39] because remember
[1:19:41] also we looked at paradise last time and
[1:19:43] let's read this real quick
[1:19:44] in luke 23 verse 42
[1:19:47] then we're going about an hour so we're
[1:19:49] good and he sent us
[1:19:51] and he said unto jesus well right under
[1:19:53] paradise we kind of skipped through a
[1:19:54] lot of this
[1:19:55] remember me when thou comest into thy
[1:19:57] kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i
[1:20:00] say unto thee today
[1:20:02] shalt thou be with me he didn't say in
[1:20:03] my kingdom
[1:20:07] because remember he had some parts to
[1:20:09] play and things to do to establish his
[1:20:11] kingdom
[1:20:12] because his kingdom is the baptism of
[1:20:14] the holy ghost amen
[1:20:16] the new birth is the kingdom of god
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] that was the promise that's day without
[1:20:21] us cannot be made perfect hebrews 11
[1:20:23] about
[1:20:24] 30 something says they all had a good
[1:20:26] report
[1:20:28] but not receiving the promise
[1:20:31] amen that's why everybody in everybody
[1:20:33] in the old testament
[1:20:34] no one got the new birth i proved that
[1:20:37] we talked about it
[1:20:38] we were reading paradise brother brown
[1:20:40] said they had to go in a certain place
[1:20:42] they couldn't go in the sixth dimension
[1:20:45] now where they went they went somewhere
[1:20:48] a place of holding bosom of abraham
[1:20:50] paradise but now paradise is emptied up
[1:20:53] and they're waiting somewhere
[1:20:57] to have their body glorified or changed
[1:21:01] everybody okay with that they don't i
[1:21:02] don't believe they're walking around in
[1:21:03] their glorified body right now
[1:21:06] right if not then the two scriptures
[1:21:09] you've got to pass those two scriptures
[1:21:11] we're fixing to read
[1:21:12] that there's only one man received
[1:21:14] immortality and that's the
[1:21:16] king potentate king of kings and lord of
[1:21:18] lords
[1:21:19] all right so you say where are they it's
[1:21:22] not going to bother me to find out they
[1:21:24] were
[1:21:25] but i just don't see how that they can
[1:21:27] be made perfect that's why i said i
[1:21:29] can't see how the woman at the well
[1:21:31] got the new birth before jesus died i
[1:21:34] don't see how the woman at the well
[1:21:35] got the baptism of the holy ghost in her
[1:21:37] soul and made her eternal before i did
[1:21:40] or before the before the 120 in the
[1:21:42] upper room did
[1:21:43] that's right not me the 120 up room i
[1:21:45] can't see that
[1:21:47] you understand i mean jesus even went to
[1:21:50] the disciples said receive ye the holy
[1:21:52] ghost
[1:21:53] now remember the bible even tells us
[1:21:54] that was a promise
[1:21:56] they didn't receive it right then that
[1:21:57] was a promise that on the day of
[1:21:59] pentecost they would receive it
[1:22:01] all right so paradise he said today thou
[1:22:03] shalt be with me
[1:22:04] in paradise now let's read one or two
[1:22:07] quotes of this if you don't mind number
[1:22:09] 12
[1:22:10] just keep going thank you brothers now
[1:22:12] this witch of endor this is demonology
[1:22:14] in 1953
[1:22:16] she called up the spirit of samuel and
[1:22:18] saul talked to samuel
[1:22:19] now you might wonder how that could be
[1:22:21] done it cannot be done today
[1:22:25] everybody see that brother branham says
[1:22:28] it cannot be
[1:22:29] done today
[1:22:34] no sir because the blood of bulls and
[1:22:36] goats was only a
[1:22:37] waiting for the time of fulfillment when
[1:22:40] a man died in those days preachers
[1:22:42] backed me up if you think is right
[1:22:44] when a man died he died under the
[1:22:45] atonement of an animal
[1:22:47] and his soul went into paradise and
[1:22:50] there he stayed until that the day of
[1:22:52] redemption
[1:22:54] and his soul was in there
[1:22:58] it's theophany because your soul is your
[1:23:00] theophany right
[1:23:01] right now watch demonology again
[1:23:06] number 13. i can see jesus go up there
[1:23:08] paradise there's old abraham isaac and
[1:23:10] jacob
[1:23:11] and them and there samuel and all the
[1:23:12] rest of them i can hear him knocking the
[1:23:14] door
[1:23:15] oh i love this it gets me right feel
[1:23:17] kind of religious now
[1:23:19] i can see look over there and hear who
[1:23:21] is that who is there
[1:23:22] this is abraham talking who is it i'm
[1:23:25] the seed of abraham amen i can see
[1:23:27] abraham come to the door to open the
[1:23:28] door
[1:23:29] he said i'm the seed of abraham look
[1:23:31] each one
[1:23:32] saw jesus christ in theophany form but
[1:23:35] they saw him in the revelation that they
[1:23:37] saw him in the old testament
[1:23:42] because look daniel said look here
[1:23:44] there's the stone now look
[1:23:46] we read it as the stone being hewed out
[1:23:48] of a mountain not made with hands
[1:23:50] and destroying the kingdom who was that
[1:23:54] that was jesus christ destroying what
[1:23:58] destroying the kingdom here now look
[1:24:00] and abraham there's one place where
[1:24:02] abraham says oh look sarah there's the
[1:24:03] man that
[1:24:04] that we fed the calf to
[1:24:07] so in his theophany he looked just like
[1:24:10] melchizedek
[1:24:13] i can hear the people say there he is
[1:24:15] i've seen him like dust under his feet
[1:24:17] clouds moving now this is ezekiel when
[1:24:20] the rams clapped their hands the leaves
[1:24:22] and all shouted oh i can see the
[1:24:23] different ones there in paradise
[1:24:25] waiting for him i can hear him say
[1:24:28] see i can hear job say without that i
[1:24:31] can hear job say
[1:24:32] there's my redeemer there's the one
[1:24:34] that's talked to me
[1:24:35] there's the one that spoke to me when i
[1:24:37] was down and out and all those different
[1:24:39] things there's the guy
[1:24:41] he's a never changing god but look they
[1:24:44] didn't ever see him as a person
[1:24:48] they saw him in the revelation for the
[1:24:49] time they had ezekiel the wheel in the
[1:24:51] middle of the wheel
[1:24:53] daniel saw him as the ancient of days
[1:24:56] but when he went down to paradise to
[1:24:58] pick him up they had a clarity
[1:25:01] they had clarity about who he was
[1:25:03] because you know what they knew they
[1:25:04] were
[1:25:05] already passed on they knew they were in
[1:25:07] a place of holding
[1:25:08] waiting a time that he was going to come
[1:25:12] and then there he opens the door well it
[1:25:14] might not have been a real door
[1:25:15] but it was a dimensional thing jesus
[1:25:18] stepped in that dimension and said here
[1:25:20] i am
[1:25:22] he had already been to the souls that
[1:25:23] preached in hell so he'd already been
[1:25:25] down there preaching to them
[1:25:26] i'm the one that that noah preached
[1:25:28] about for 120 years that you turned me
[1:25:30] down
[1:25:32] but he didn't stay there he grabbed the
[1:25:34] keys from satan and went up to the next
[1:25:35] dimension
[1:25:36] went to paradise open up the doors
[1:25:41] i can hear him say come on it's breaking
[1:25:42] daylight over in jerusalem
[1:25:45] you got to get out of here we're going
[1:25:47] up because you trusted in the blood of
[1:25:48] bulls and ghosts waiting for the time
[1:25:50] that my blood
[1:25:51] say but my blood's been shed up yonder
[1:25:53] on calvary i am the incarnate son of god
[1:25:56] all sin debt is paid we're on the road
[1:25:58] out hallelujah
[1:25:59] glory to god and you see abraham grabs
[1:26:01] sarah by the arm
[1:26:02] and here they come now look
[1:26:07] not old no more that was abraham and
[1:26:10] sarah yeah
[1:26:12] not old no more we were talking about
[1:26:13] that before we read where
[1:26:15] samuel was brought up out of paradise by
[1:26:17] the witch of endor
[1:26:19] and what happened he was still in his
[1:26:21] prophet robe and he still looked like
[1:26:22] samuel did
[1:26:23] because he'd only been dead two years
[1:26:26] brother brown says he'd been dead two
[1:26:27] years
[1:26:28] and he still looked the same so what
[1:26:30] paradise is different from the sixth
[1:26:32] dimension to me paradise
[1:26:33] you stu you were stuck in what you were
[1:26:35] in
[1:26:37] everybody understand that i don't
[1:26:38] believe the people in the fifth
[1:26:39] dimension are in young bodies
[1:26:42] see what i mean they're in the body they
[1:26:44] send in they're in there in the
[1:26:45] theophany that
[1:26:47] and whatever place it was that's where
[1:26:49] they're at and the condition they're in
[1:26:51] that's what they are
[1:26:52] because they got to come back here too
[1:26:54] and pick up their body that they send
[1:26:56] them
[1:26:56] and stand before the white throne
[1:26:57] judgment because they sure they send in
[1:26:59] their soul but they sin
[1:27:01] in that body that body's got to be
[1:27:02] destroyed the same way as the soul
[1:27:04] everybody got that saying ma'am that was
[1:27:07] too fast i'm sorry let's read number 14.
[1:27:09] so we got to get done with this
[1:27:14] here he comes climbing up brother she's
[1:27:18] coming daylight i can see the big
[1:27:19] morning star looking around the grave
[1:27:21] already it's coming on the third day
[1:27:22] hallelujah the first
[1:27:24] wait he's got somebody else over in
[1:27:25] paradise he don't forget nobody
[1:27:28] pass me not old gentle savior hear my
[1:27:29] humble cry over here in paradise lay
[1:27:31] some souls abraham isaac jacob sarah and
[1:27:34] those who've been faithful
[1:27:35] believing the promise of the prophet see
[1:27:37] he's going through hebrews 11.
[1:27:39] all the great men of faith but remember
[1:27:42] they had faith in what that he was
[1:27:44] coming
[1:27:46] now look we're on this side not having
[1:27:48] faith he's come coming
[1:27:50] he's here amen
[1:27:53] who've been faithful believing the
[1:27:55] promise of what the prophets
[1:27:57] and they're laying there waiting with
[1:27:59] only the blood of bulls and goats a
[1:28:01] shadow a type of his own blood
[1:28:03] i can see him go up paradise knock on
[1:28:05] the door abraham opens the door who are
[1:28:07] you i'm the seed of abraham
[1:28:08] i can hear daniel what the stone i've
[1:28:10] seen hewed out of the mountain without
[1:28:11] hands i can hear ezekiel
[1:28:12] so i'm coming with such speed to look
[1:28:14] like powerful with dust under his feet
[1:28:16] oh my
[1:28:16] i can hear the prophets say i wrestled
[1:28:19] with him all night
[1:28:20] that's jacob right wrestled with him all
[1:28:23] night down at the river before i crossed
[1:28:25] and this is the part i want you to see
[1:28:27] john the different ones recognize him so
[1:28:29] john recognized him
[1:28:31] he said behold the lamb of god that took
[1:28:32] away the sin of the world he said i see
[1:28:34] the results of that
[1:28:36] right i remember he got his head cut off
[1:28:38] before jesus died
[1:28:40] so he was over in paradise waiting the
[1:28:43] time
[1:28:45] just about 15 minutes before time with
[1:28:47] graves going to open up
[1:28:49] my righteous blood has been shed for you
[1:28:51] you were waiting on me
[1:28:52] under the blood of goats and bulls which
[1:28:54] could not take you into the presence of
[1:28:56] the father
[1:28:57] but i've shed my blood to take it away
[1:29:00] now we're on our road
[1:29:02] home questions and answers
[1:29:07] number 15. look jesus told his disciples
[1:29:10] taking their communion he said i'll eat
[1:29:12] no more the fruit of the vine until i
[1:29:13] eat it and drink it with you and you and
[1:29:15] my father's kingdom is that right
[1:29:17] so we when the dead dies a justified
[1:29:20] person standing in the presence of god
[1:29:22] goes into the presence as an immortal
[1:29:24] being now look
[1:29:25] immortal be not an immortal totally
[1:29:27] immortal
[1:29:28] immortal means that you were once mortal
[1:29:31] and now
[1:29:32] you're immortal because remember
[1:29:34] whatever souls in the fifth dimension
[1:29:36] whatever soul's in the sixth dimension
[1:29:38] they don't have their body they were
[1:29:39] born in
[1:29:41] hello the body's in the grave
[1:29:45] you don't take the body with you the
[1:29:47] body stays in the grave
[1:29:49] it's just the soul the soul is immortal
[1:29:53] you get born again your soul becomes
[1:29:55] immortal
[1:29:57] takes you into what heavenly places
[1:30:01] standing in the presence of god goes
[1:30:03] into his presence as an immortal
[1:30:04] immoral immoral excuse me immortal being
[1:30:07] and lives in the blessed realms of peace
[1:30:09] what
[1:30:10] until the day that he returns back now
[1:30:12] there was a time that the people didn't
[1:30:14] go into the presence of god when they
[1:30:15] died
[1:30:16] why blood of bulls and ghosts they
[1:30:19] weren't born again
[1:30:23] the justified that was in the old
[1:30:25] testament they went into a place called
[1:30:26] paradise
[1:30:27] and they're the souls of the just waited
[1:30:29] in paradise the paradise was a place
[1:30:31] where god
[1:30:32] kept the souls in like a dreamland until
[1:30:34] the blood of jesus christ was shed
[1:30:36] for the blood of bulls and goats would
[1:30:38] not take away sin
[1:30:39] it only covered up sin but jesus blood
[1:30:41] takes away sin
[1:30:43] you notice that his when he died at
[1:30:44] calvary and on his return he brought out
[1:30:47] from the grave those dead saints that
[1:30:48] had died under the atonement of blood
[1:30:50] of bulls goats and heifers let's read
[1:30:54] this rapture nut
[1:30:55] number 16. the old testament saints has
[1:30:58] gone into his presence
[1:30:59] presence paradise done away he's taken
[1:31:01] the order of the rapture
[1:31:03] paradise done away and the old testament
[1:31:05] saints ascended up
[1:31:07] at his loud voice when he screamed and
[1:31:08] gave up the ghost because why the
[1:31:10] sacrifice the propitiation of their sins
[1:31:13] that they had waited on believed that
[1:31:15] perfect lamb was coming
[1:31:17] they had offered the sacrifice the lamb
[1:31:20] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:31:21] ghost he screamed with a loud voice and
[1:31:23] the old testament saints
[1:31:24] awoke watched the shout the voice the
[1:31:27] same thing it is coming
[1:31:28] yielded up the ghost and when he did the
[1:31:30] sacrifice was perfect
[1:31:32] paradise was emptied out in the old
[1:31:33] testament saints came to the earth
[1:31:35] walked around on earth
[1:31:36] and entered into him at his rapture now
[1:31:38] i believe that
[1:31:40] because that's what the prophet said but
[1:31:43] they weren't in a human body
[1:31:47] no no one in the human body
[1:31:50] they weren't a theophany body the same
[1:31:52] one that they were in there they weren't
[1:31:53] theophany body everybody got that
[1:31:55] all right david said over there lift up
[1:31:57] the everlasting gates be lifted up he
[1:31:59] led captivity captive gave gifts to men
[1:32:02] and the old testament saints went in
[1:32:03] with him now where'd they go as my point
[1:32:05] was the other day where did they go
[1:32:07] because
[1:32:08] they didn't go to the future home
[1:32:12] homes not for them that's for us
[1:32:16] so they're in a place of waiting
[1:32:19] in a city because it's got gates
[1:32:23] but when brother rome went in the sixth
[1:32:24] dimension he didn't see that
[1:32:26] right he saw the saints that were like
[1:32:28] he said there was just
[1:32:29] plains and valleys and hills pla plains
[1:32:32] you know what i mean
[1:32:33] not airplanes lord don't get that
[1:32:38] started
[1:32:40] everybody everybody goes i'm glad he
[1:32:43] explained that
[1:32:46] no airplanes okay in the sixth dimension
[1:32:49] you will not need an airplane
[1:32:52] coming back here you will not need an
[1:32:54] airplane
[1:32:56] i don't know how that got started well i
[1:32:57] do the devil got that started
[1:33:00] but anyway there's in other words it was
[1:33:01] a it was not even a city
[1:33:06] he never recorded there was a city he
[1:33:07] just said people came running over the
[1:33:09] hills and
[1:33:10] and and hugged him and said god bless
[1:33:11] you my brother god bless you my brother
[1:33:14] so they're in a place of waiting they're
[1:33:15] in a holding place just like the new the
[1:33:17] old testament saints
[1:33:19] they're in a place to wait lift up the
[1:33:22] everlasting gates and be lifted up
[1:33:24] he led captivity captive give gifts unto
[1:33:26] men
[1:33:27] the old testament saints went in with
[1:33:29] him they said who is this king of
[1:33:30] righteousness the lord of glory mighty
[1:33:32] and host mighty host here they come in
[1:33:34] marching
[1:33:35] jesus led captivity captive now remember
[1:33:37] it that had to be set just for the old
[1:33:39] testament saints
[1:33:40] because that six dimension people are
[1:33:42] not in that group
[1:33:44] we're talking about paradise
[1:33:47] the only the first person that went into
[1:33:49] the sixth dimension after jesus came
[1:33:51] back on the day of pentecost
[1:33:52] was was stephen brother brown said he
[1:33:55] was the first martyr
[1:33:56] right he was the first one that went
[1:33:58] into that sixth dimension
[1:34:01] he wasn't lonely after that either they
[1:34:03] just kept killing every one of them
[1:34:05] amen but remember john wasn't in that
[1:34:07] group john the baptist was not now we
[1:34:09] know
[1:34:09] john the revelator was but john the
[1:34:10] baptist was not in that group
[1:34:12] he's in this group of the old testament
[1:34:14] saints everybody got that
[1:34:19] the lord mighty in battle the gates flew
[1:34:20] open and jesus conquered led captivity
[1:34:22] captive
[1:34:23] then they had believed on him and the
[1:34:25] word had come to them
[1:34:26] there the old testament saints laying
[1:34:28] there waiting he led captive captive
[1:34:31] captivity captain ascended on high took
[1:34:33] the old testament saints and went in
[1:34:35] there is one rapture already passed he
[1:34:37] was proven there's a rapture you know in
[1:34:38] the old testament
[1:34:39] and because that was an old testament
[1:34:41] rapture
[1:34:43] that wasn't a new testament rapture that
[1:34:44] was an old testament rapture
[1:34:46] got that the new testament rapture is
[1:34:51] happening in just
[1:34:52] hopefully in days weeks or months
[1:34:56] some of y'all's already happened the
[1:34:58] dead in christ shall rise first
[1:35:04] number 17. and now in this vision i
[1:35:08] believe i was caught up to that sixth
[1:35:10] dimension we're going to cover that
[1:35:11] just for a minute looking back down here
[1:35:15] and could see back
[1:35:16] see the sight isn't exactly with the
[1:35:18] eyes
[1:35:19] that's earthly but sight is a greater
[1:35:23] thing than the sight that they have
[1:35:25] there see
[1:35:26] they didn't lose their five senses they
[1:35:28] just had a greater sense
[1:35:30] the sight that they have there their
[1:35:32] contact is far beyond any contact
[1:35:35] that our natural senses would contact
[1:35:38] because remember
[1:35:39] and you may not like this but i'm going
[1:35:40] to tell you something brother branham
[1:35:42] was the prophet of the age but when he
[1:35:43] went across the curtain of time they
[1:35:45] were telling him where he was at
[1:35:46] what he was doing he was a leader and
[1:35:48] when he's why he's got to go back
[1:35:51] so they and even sharon rose was there
[1:35:53] as a young lady
[1:35:54] i gotta wait here on billy you go see
[1:35:57] mama
[1:35:58] and even his first wife that had died
[1:36:04] didn't even recognize him as her husband
[1:36:08] nope i'll read it to you this is kind of
[1:36:11] long i'm going to read it though and
[1:36:12] we'll be done here in just a second
[1:36:16] then y'all go find something that makes
[1:36:17] you happy and you stay awake for that
[1:36:20] having conferences chocolate ohio and
[1:36:23] something happened
[1:36:24] i felt myself leaving this body now i
[1:36:27] never had a vision like that
[1:36:29] i looking back seeing myself lying there
[1:36:31] leaning up against the headboard of the
[1:36:33] bed
[1:36:33] with my hands up he was back there doing
[1:36:36] this
[1:36:38] wasn't like no he was thinking remember
[1:36:40] he was saying lord
[1:36:41] and then he i'll cut a part of that out
[1:36:43] because he thought media was talking to
[1:36:45] him
[1:36:46] he said honey you're talking to me and
[1:36:48] he said she said uh she was sound asleep
[1:36:51] you know so leave me alone but it wasn't
[1:36:53] for her
[1:36:54] it was for him and i looked at myself
[1:36:57] and i thought i'm dying
[1:36:58] and i started moving out the first thing
[1:37:00] you know i come into a little place
[1:37:02] that kind of said something like that
[1:37:04] and as soon as i got there
[1:37:05] here come thousands of people and
[1:37:07] everybody looked young
[1:37:08] now i'm in a mixed multitude i'm your
[1:37:10] brother and you watch i say this in the
[1:37:11] name of the lord
[1:37:13] you'll each meet me there if you'll be
[1:37:17] right one of these people say brother
[1:37:18] branham you know what
[1:37:20] he's just he's the biggest liar that
[1:37:22] ever lived
[1:37:24] or he's the greatest man that ever lived
[1:37:25] beside jesus christ
[1:37:27] you got to make that choice because the
[1:37:28] people that turn this message down
[1:37:30] they have to turn this down every time
[1:37:32] brother brown says i've got the bible
[1:37:33] laying before me and i'll meet it at
[1:37:35] judgment
[1:37:35] now if he's as wrong as they say he's
[1:37:37] wrong that boy is going to split hell
[1:37:39] wide open
[1:37:41] and he will not i'll promise you that he
[1:37:44] won't be the one that does it because he
[1:37:45] was telling the god's honest truth
[1:37:48] amen you say whatever you want to about
[1:37:51] dates and times whatever he gave
[1:37:53] he gave us the pure message for this
[1:37:55] hour
[1:37:57] now but these young girls coming to me
[1:37:59] throwing their arms around me and
[1:38:00] hollering my precious brother now look
[1:38:02] when i was a sinner i never run around i
[1:38:04] was an artery to run around with
[1:38:06] women i don't care how saintly a man
[1:38:08] tries to live and how godly he lives if
[1:38:09] a woman puts his arm around a man
[1:38:11] it's a human sensation now you just
[1:38:14] might as well i don't care you can call
[1:38:15] yourself sanctified
[1:38:17] and i believe in sanctification too but
[1:38:19] you're still a human
[1:38:20] and exactly right and there's a
[1:38:22] sensation look he says i don't say you'd
[1:38:24] do wrong certainly not the power of god
[1:38:26] keeps you and you go on but even in that
[1:38:28] place
[1:38:28] that human cessation wasn't there and
[1:38:31] here comes people just throwing their
[1:38:33] arms around saying my precious brother
[1:38:34] and all the women had long hair white
[1:38:36] garments barefooted
[1:38:37] they were young look at me about 18 20
[1:38:40] years old
[1:38:41] they grabbed me and thrown arms around
[1:38:42] me said oh our precious brother and just
[1:38:44] hug me like that and walk away
[1:38:46] and somebody else i seen my first wife
[1:38:48] which is what hope right
[1:38:50] i see my first wife come up now she died
[1:38:52] when she was about 22.
[1:38:54] she hadn't changed he recognized her
[1:38:57] because she
[1:38:57] died at that age that they were in that
[1:38:59] dimension
[1:39:01] because remember he couldn't recognize
[1:39:02] sharon rose because he said in other
[1:39:03] words who are you said daddy
[1:39:06] daddy he she was a six month old baby
[1:39:10] when he saw her last thank god that he
[1:39:12] showed us all this
[1:39:14] and my first wife came up now she died
[1:39:16] when she was about 20
[1:39:17] 22. she hadn't changed she came running
[1:39:20] i said surely
[1:39:21] she'll call me husband and she walked up
[1:39:24] she began smiling throw her arms around
[1:39:25] me she said my darling brother then she
[1:39:27] hugged some woman that had just hugged
[1:39:29] me some girl
[1:39:30] so something in there is is is lacking
[1:39:34] that that they don't have their full
[1:39:38] consciousness because remember he has
[1:39:41] another dream that sharon wrote i mean
[1:39:43] that
[1:39:43] hope grabs this arm and media grabs this
[1:39:45] arm and they know that they were married
[1:39:47] to him and they walk up into paradise
[1:39:48] or in we can call paradise listen we can
[1:39:51] call paradise what we're going to
[1:39:54] but i'm not i'm not now i've left the
[1:39:56] paradise though that god set for the
[1:39:57] people in the old testament i've left
[1:39:59] that
[1:39:59] but we are going to the paradises of god
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] because paradise means a wonderful place
[1:40:06] all right so look
[1:40:07] and here come people just throwing their
[1:40:08] arms around me saying my precious
[1:40:10] brother

[1:40:16] looks like they somebody somebody
[1:40:19] um i quoted this and and i knew i'd read
[1:40:22] it
[1:40:23] i think it was brother timbo he's not
[1:40:25] here but he said
[1:40:27] where'd brother brown say that we'd have
[1:40:28] shaggy long hair
[1:40:30] well read it for yourself and here come
[1:40:33] men look like they were in kind of
[1:40:35] shaggy hair

[1:40:53] if you can do that god bless you have it
[1:40:55] to your down to your waist i don't care
[1:40:57] but you can't do it not not if you've
[1:40:59] been married you can't do it
[1:41:01] hello somebody shag your hair down on
[1:41:03] their shoulders because look it's all
[1:41:05] been done away with there
[1:41:07] all the sexual stuff and all that's what
[1:41:09] brother i'm saying he said then women
[1:41:10] just hugging him
[1:41:11] and they must have felt like women but
[1:41:14] there was no sensation there because you
[1:41:16] know what you don't lose your body you
[1:41:17] have your uh
[1:41:18] your theophany is what you are all right
[1:41:22] here come men look like where were kind

[1:41:30] thank god no dentist in glory
[1:41:33] right sister after right everybody's had
[1:41:36] teeth work done
[1:41:37] they were throwing their arms around me
[1:41:39] saying oh our precious brother and one
[1:41:41] of them hollered at the other one said
[1:41:43] think he's arrived he's arrived at last
[1:41:47] they were looking for him to come right
[1:41:51] they were looking for it they had to be
[1:41:53] some kind of connection there some kind
[1:41:55] of pull
[1:41:56] from this dimension to that dimension
[1:41:58] for them to know he's arrived at last
[1:42:00] and i thought
[1:42:01] have i died and this is i've come into
[1:42:04] glory is this it
[1:42:05] i thought it couldn't be because
[1:42:08] remember
[1:42:09] his revelation before that was is that
[1:42:11] he would be on a cloud
[1:42:12] brother neville would be on the cloud
[1:42:14] and they would just pass each other and
[1:42:15] he said their hand wouldn't
[1:42:16] be able to shake hands remember the old
[1:42:19] thing where we all want to play harps
[1:42:20] and sit on the cloud and play hard
[1:42:22] i'm in trouble our brother back there he
[1:42:25] might be able to play one but i
[1:42:27] i'm you know i want to be able to throw
[1:42:30] my arms around somebody because that's
[1:42:31] what it
[1:42:32] that we're humans they were throwing
[1:42:34] their arms around me saying oh our
[1:42:36] precious brother and one of them
[1:42:37] hollered
[1:42:37] and think he's arrived he's arrived at
[1:42:39] last and i thought if i
[1:42:41] and i looked and that voice that it
[1:42:43] spoke to me down in my room i heard it
[1:42:45] again
[1:42:46] i looked back and i see myself laying
[1:42:48] there on the bed
[1:42:49] i never had anything like that to happen
[1:42:51] it's done something to me i can never be
[1:42:53] the same no more
[1:42:55] i looked i thought what is this i
[1:42:56] thought well all them people looking
[1:42:58] young and i looked down and i was young
[1:43:03] if you're born again today and now the
[1:43:06] older people need to start running the
[1:43:08] aisles
[1:43:08] well walk in the aisles maybe
[1:43:12] but if you're born again today and i'm
[1:43:13] not being silly
[1:43:15] your soul is a 20 year old soul
[1:43:24] you when you got you got changed you got
[1:43:26] a new birth when he birthed you he
[1:43:28] birthed you back to a young man and
[1:43:30] woman
[1:43:32] it's just the cuckoo birds got to get
[1:43:33] changed
[1:43:36] what is this i thought well all then
[1:43:38] people look young i looked down i was
[1:43:40] young i had turned back to a young man
[1:43:42] again
[1:43:43] i said well this is strange and i looked
[1:43:45] i can't explain it
[1:43:47] there's no words that i can think of if
[1:43:49] i'd say superb or sublime or perfect
[1:43:52] that wouldn't touch it there was no
[1:43:55] tomorrow
[1:43:56] there was no yesterday there they were
[1:43:59] in eternity
[1:44:00] and they never got tired they never had
[1:44:02] to eat
[1:44:03] yet they had senses i could feel them
[1:44:06] they could speak
[1:44:07] they were looking at me they had senses
[1:44:10] i said i don't understand this
[1:44:12] that voice says this is perfect love
[1:44:14] isn't that what you spoke the holy
[1:44:16] ghost holy spirit was i said yes and
[1:44:19] this
[1:44:20] is perfect love so everybody in that
[1:44:22] dimension had perfect love which was the
[1:44:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:25] the new birth and just then a beautiful
[1:44:27] young woman ran up and said oh my
[1:44:28] darling brother she said we're so happy
[1:44:30] to see you welcome
[1:44:32] and she walked away i said praise the
[1:44:33] lord sister i looked around
[1:44:36] then i thought what is this now he
[1:44:38] didn't know who she was
[1:44:41] who was this i thought what is this
[1:44:44] what's going on what happened the voice
[1:44:45] said in the bible
[1:44:46] where it said that jacob was gathered
[1:44:48] with his people and the other one this
[1:44:50] is like and unto that where you'll
[1:44:52] gather with your
[1:44:53] where you will gather with your people i
[1:44:56] said all them branhams
[1:44:59] i never believed there was that many he
[1:45:01] said they're not brandons
[1:45:02] they're your converts they're your
[1:45:04] converts said that woman that you're
[1:45:06] admiring
[1:45:07] you know how old she was when you let
[1:45:09] her to christ i said i have no idea
[1:45:12] he said past 90.
[1:45:16] said see she's young forever and she
[1:45:17] looked up at me and said brother branham
[1:45:19] jesus will come someday and then we'll
[1:45:22] go back to earth
[1:45:23] said then we'll receive our glorified
[1:45:25] body then we'll live together forever
[1:45:27] she had pretty good revelation
[1:45:30] a little bit better than the prophet had
[1:45:31] at that moment in time
[1:45:33] boy it didn't go over good well i'm just
[1:45:36] reading what he said
[1:45:38] right oh let me see jesus
[1:45:42] oh you was a leader you led us oh let me
[1:45:45] see jesus
[1:45:46] if i passed over i want to see him and
[1:45:47] that voice said you can't see him now
[1:45:51] he will come and be first you know why i
[1:45:52] couldn't see him number one
[1:45:54] he was looking at his body right there
[1:45:59] that sixth dimension is the body of the
[1:46:01] believers the body of jesus christ
[1:46:03] you're the body of jesus christ not your
[1:46:05] human body
[1:46:07] your glorified body
[1:46:10] and that voice said you can't see him
[1:46:12] now said he will come but first he will
[1:46:15] come to you
[1:46:16] and said judge you by the gospel you
[1:46:19] preached and then i
[1:46:20] i took the part out save time he said
[1:46:22] well did paul make it
[1:46:23] the angel said paul made it he said well
[1:46:25] glory to god i'll make it too cause i
[1:46:26] preach just what paul preached

[1:47:28] fair now watch he's preaching the
[1:47:30] countdown
[1:47:31] we got it amen is being proved
[1:47:32] everywhere astronaut age
[1:47:34] we're living in it was made of things
[1:47:37] which do not appear so about the
[1:47:40] creation of the world see it was made of
[1:47:42] something out of heaven
[1:47:43] it's god himself here in that sixth
[1:47:45] dimension it's the power of god
[1:47:47] we've been in such a place to we have
[1:47:49] been lifted up into that dimension
[1:47:52] beyond this thing of going to the grave
[1:47:54] and weeping he's talking about himself
[1:47:57] but he's talking about an astronaut has
[1:47:59] been taken to a place a dimension
[1:48:01] he's the one that went in the sixth
[1:48:02] dimension we'll see them there now look
[1:48:06] they slitched up on me here oh right
[1:48:08] there thank you
[1:48:09] this thing i'm putting the crepe on the
[1:48:11] doorknob and saying goodbye forever
[1:48:13] hallelujah
[1:48:14] we done got in the astronaut and sailed
[1:48:17] off out yonder and seen where it's at
[1:48:18] and look
[1:48:19] and return back glory we're going to the
[1:48:22] home beyond the sky yonder beyond the
[1:48:24] reasoning of man
[1:48:25] how the old will be transformed into the
[1:48:27] moment of twinkling of an eye
[1:48:29] we shall see them there old men and
[1:48:31] women young again
[1:48:33] how do you know the bible teaches it and
[1:48:36] god
[1:48:36] shot an astronaut up in there we know
[1:48:41] what it's all about and come back
[1:48:44] there's no worry about dying remember he
[1:48:46] said afterwards he said i'm not gonna
[1:48:47] worry about dying no more
[1:48:48] dying's nothing sure it's living yes sir
[1:48:51] it's just getting your feet off the
[1:48:52] ground
[1:48:53] so we can go how
[1:48:56] wonderful so that we can go
[1:49:00] i want to read two scriptures to you
[1:49:01] real quick and we'll be done
[1:49:03] because we'll get into the seventh
[1:49:04] dimension later on because remember the
[1:49:06] seventh dimension is what
[1:49:08] god alone all right first timothy 6
[1:49:11] verse 15 says which in his time he shall
[1:49:13] show
[1:49:14] who is the blessed and only potentate
[1:49:17] the king of kings
[1:49:18] and lord of lords now look it's capital
[1:49:20] k lower case k
[1:49:21] capital l lower case he's talking about
[1:49:23] us
[1:49:25] transfer transforming from mortal to
[1:49:28] immortality look verse
[1:49:29] 16 who only hath immortality
[1:49:33] now what does immortality mean that
[1:49:35] means you were once mortal
[1:49:37] see the angels can't say that satan
[1:49:39] can't say that satan cannot be immortal
[1:49:41] he was never immortal to begin with
[1:49:43] angels were never mortals to begin with
[1:49:45] but you and i were mortals everybody
[1:49:47] that's gonna
[1:49:47] die that's lived on this earth look is
[1:49:49] either in the fifth dimension or sixth
[1:49:51] dimension
[1:49:52] are still alive in the first three amen
[1:49:55] there's nothing else there's no
[1:49:56] peripheral there's no other
[1:49:59] universe that we've got people on i
[1:50:02] don't believe that
[1:50:04] who only hath immortality
[1:50:07] dwelling in the light which no man can
[1:50:09] approach unto
[1:50:13] so the seventh dimension is only jesus
[1:50:15] christ
[1:50:17] because he was once a mortal and now
[1:50:18] he's become immortal
[1:50:20] everybody got that whom no man hath seen
[1:50:23] nor
[1:50:24] can see you know why brother brown
[1:50:25] couldn't see him because of that
[1:50:26] scripture right there
[1:50:28] he was barred from seeing him by that
[1:50:30] scripture right there
[1:50:31] to whom be honor and power everlasting
[1:50:34] amen let's read second timothy 1 verse 9
[1:50:37] who has saved us and called us with a
[1:50:38] holy calling not according to our works
[1:50:42] but according to his what own purpose
[1:50:44] and grace sounds like ephesians 1
[1:50:46] which was given us what in christ jesus
[1:50:49] before the world began
[1:50:51] but is now made manifest
[1:50:54] by the appearing of our savior jesus
[1:50:56] christ who has abolished death
[1:50:58] and has brought life and immortality to
[1:51:01] light
[1:51:01] through the gospel a way that you and i
[1:51:03] can become immortal
[1:51:06] is only through the gospel the preaching
[1:51:07] of the gospel by the five-fold ministry
[1:51:09] that's the only way you don't become
[1:51:10] immortal
[1:51:11] you can't press play and become immortal
[1:51:17] part of it but not all of it let's stand
[1:51:20] our feet musicians come we're gonna sing
[1:51:22] one song who's
[1:51:23] michael you coming okay we'll sing one
[1:51:25] song it's four o'clock
[1:51:27] god bless you we love you pray for us
[1:51:30] this next week next weekend we're gonna
[1:51:33] be at brother chris's for about five
[1:51:36] days so we'll be having a
[1:51:38] little time of fellowship out there but
[1:51:40] just pray for us with our
[1:51:43] plane flight and all that stuff keep us
[1:51:46] safe by the grace of god
[1:51:48] amen you love the lord listen you're
[1:51:51] part of the plan
[1:51:52] listen you're part of the plan whether
[1:51:54] you want to be or not
[1:51:56] because there's a place for the fifth
[1:51:58] dimension people
[1:52:00] amen you just got to what
[1:52:03] you've got to obtain an inheritance
[1:52:06] you've got to do like sister esther said
[1:52:09] you've got to just say
[1:52:11] i'm tired i'm sick and tired of being
[1:52:13] sick and tired
[1:52:16] now listen we all have troubles and
[1:52:17] heartaches we know that like i said
[1:52:18] before
[1:52:19] but listen they should not be like what
[1:52:22] we had out in the world
[1:52:25] then you don't have nobody to talk to
[1:52:27] you talking to the same dude that made
[1:52:28] you that way
[1:52:29] i'm talking about the devil but our ups
[1:52:32] and downs can't be like they were before
[1:52:35] look at that chaos that's going on out
[1:52:36] there in the world read some of the
[1:52:38] stuff
[1:52:39] that's going on out there in the world
[1:52:43] and they say they're normal
[1:52:47] listen we got a transgender by the
[1:52:49] stupid people that we
[1:52:51] somebody elected have got a transgender
[1:52:54] woman man
[1:52:58] as our health director
[1:53:04] she was an ugly man she's the worst ugly
[1:53:06] woman
[1:53:07] but i'm just saying listen god's gonna
[1:53:10] have to raise sodom and gomorrah and
[1:53:13] totally apologize if he don't destroy
[1:53:15] this nation
[1:53:17] and what that person's trying to do is
[1:53:20] instigate
[1:53:21] that we give our kids have you read
[1:53:23] about this
[1:53:25] a puberty pill to keep them from going
[1:53:27] through puberty so they can decide
[1:53:29] what sex they are uh-huh y'all look at
[1:53:33] each other if you want to but that's
[1:53:34] exactly you read your
[1:53:36] you read the write paper don't read the
[1:53:37] stupid stuff you're reading amen
[1:53:41] go read what australia is saying about
[1:53:43] the united states
[1:53:45] the biggest idiot of a president that's
[1:53:47] ever been in the face of the earth
[1:53:50] can't even hold a press conference and
[1:53:53] here we are
[1:53:53] great america i think we're so great the
[1:53:55] only great thing people is god
[1:53:58] but see you see what they're going to do
[1:53:59] though if they start requiring that you
[1:54:01] do that to your children
[1:54:02] you better never do that they're
[1:54:06] requiring they're
[1:54:07] they don't not yet but they're talking
[1:54:08] about it
[1:54:10] doing some kind of hormone replacement
[1:54:12] and waiting for your kids to come of an
[1:54:14] age where they can decide whether they
[1:54:15] want to be a man or a woman
[1:54:19] that's insanity if brother branham said
[1:54:21] we were that far from insanity we have
[1:54:23] went all the way over on the other side
[1:54:25] and made a circle all the way back
[1:54:29] but that's what we're looking at so
[1:54:30] they're calling us abnormal
[1:54:32] because we're christians and we're we
[1:54:34] have calm in the storm and we
[1:54:36] we don't talk about all that stuff and
[1:54:38] and you know we do have problems we do
[1:54:40] have
[1:54:40] we do have everybody's got issues we're
[1:54:42] human but your issues should not
[1:54:44] dictate your christianity your
[1:54:47] christianity should dictate your issues
[1:54:50] you want me to say that one more time
[1:54:53] like something like
[1:54:53] listen i and i i agree 100 we should be
[1:54:57] careful
[1:54:58] but listen there's some people that
[1:54:59] ain't gonna darken these doors again
[1:55:01] just because of this virus they're gonna
[1:55:02] they're gonna say it's an excuse from
[1:55:03] now till the day
[1:55:04] that jesus comes
[1:55:08] sorry but that's just the way it is but
[1:55:10] you know what it's separating time it's
[1:55:12] to find out whether you'll make gonna
[1:55:13] make it or not gonna make it
[1:55:16] we're gonna make it amen we're going to
[1:55:19] make it
[1:55:20] somebody's going to make it i'm just
[1:55:21] dumb enough to attach myself to it
[1:55:24] amen i just think that we've come to a
[1:55:27] time that right now is a decision time
[1:55:30] you're going to have to decide this year
[1:55:33] who you gonna serve
[1:55:34] because it's gonna get worse not better
[1:55:37] we see all these policies and stuff
[1:55:39] coming up
[1:55:41] we may not even be able to meet in six
[1:55:44] months who knows that
[1:55:45] right we don't know they're taking away
[1:55:47] our guns i really don't care you know
[1:55:48] what because i believe in jesus christ
[1:55:51] not an assault rifle okay but i still
[1:55:54] like my hunting guns where i go hunting
[1:55:56] when i want to that's my
[1:55:57] that's a that's a right that's not a
[1:55:59] privilege i have a right to do that
[1:56:01] amen get off of that sing a song
[1:56:06] just start singing a song while i'm
[1:56:08] doing that touching
[1:56:10] jesus is
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:40] and
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:49] if you need a touch from the lord
[1:56:51] because touching jesus
[1:57:00] yes lord
[1:57:11] just think about where you came from
[1:57:14] and what you are now
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:33] cause touching jesus
[1:57:37] is all that really matters
[1:57:44] then your life will never be
[1:57:49] the same
[1:57:56] and touches our sisters lord that it
[1:57:58] will do exactly what it said it would do
[1:58:00] lord
[1:58:01] that by your stripes were already healed
[1:58:02] and evil spirits that will go away
[1:58:05] from where they are lord we thank you
[1:58:07] lord we can do this
[1:58:08] in jesus name we pray amen thank you
[1:58:11] thank you sing it one more time
[1:58:21] that really matters
[1:58:26] and your life will never
[1:58:30] be the same
[1:58:37] there is only
[1:58:40] one way to touch him
[1:58:46] and
[1:58:54] you know you think about all those
[1:58:55] people in the old testament
[1:58:57] see we can look back and we can see that
[1:58:59] the savior died we know that jesus
[1:59:00] christ came and we
[1:59:02] but still we have to believe it by faith
[1:59:03] because we didn't see it physically with
[1:59:05] our
[1:59:05] physical eyes but they had to believe it
[1:59:10] a virgin shall conceive back in before
[1:59:14] before you know be in the bc
[1:59:17] they had to believe all that and they
[1:59:20] died
[1:59:21] having a good report the bible says what
[1:59:23] believing
[1:59:24] that there was one coming ezekiel said i
[1:59:26] know that that will is coming i know
[1:59:28] daniel said i know that ancient of days
[1:59:30] is coming even
[1:59:31] david in the psalms i'm sure he in his
[1:59:33] revelation saw jesus christ
[1:59:36] but when they saw that person they
[1:59:38] identified exactly who he was
[1:59:41] when you and i receive the new birth you
[1:59:43] ought to be able to identify
[1:59:45] that person that comes to you because
[1:59:47] he's not going to just come to you he's
[1:59:48] going to live in you
[1:59:50] and that's like the song says your life
[1:59:52] will never be the same
[1:59:54] but there's only one way to touch him
[1:59:56] and that's believe
[1:59:57] when you call on his name let's let's uh
[2:00:00] as we dismissed our brother
[2:00:02] and sister god bless them thank you for
[2:00:05] coming thank you for sharing your time
[2:00:06] with us
[2:00:07] thank you for coming by our way maybe
[2:00:09] we'll try to get your way sometime
[2:00:11] amen and get to visit with them if not
[2:00:14] then you know what we'll have a thousand
[2:00:15] years in the millennium we'll get to
[2:00:17] we can visit for a thousand years so
[2:00:19] that's gonna be hard for aaron to do
[2:00:20] that
[2:00:20] a thousand years but maybe when we get
[2:00:22] into eternity but remember him he'll be
[2:00:24] speaking wednesday night
[2:00:26] and then we'll be off on the journey
[2:00:27] wherever they're getting ready to go
[2:00:28] you're going back home now or
[2:00:30] no we will continue to go into tennessee
[2:00:33] jeffersonville salt lake city
[2:00:35] utah we gotta really pray for this man
[2:00:42] maybe you can teach those people out
[2:00:44] there something amen but let's pray for
[2:00:46] them they're going to travel around the
[2:00:47] united states and see this great country
[2:00:49] and and listen it is a great country as
[2:00:52] far as the country but politics is just
[2:00:55] dead rotten and we've let it somehow
[2:00:59] worm its way into our lives where i
[2:01:01] thought we'd come over here to get away
[2:01:02] from that
[2:01:03] so uh our founding fathers george
[2:01:05] washington and all them would turn over
[2:01:07] in their grave if they saw
[2:01:08] what was going on now but you know you
[2:01:10] what you pray for your pastor
[2:01:14] that's the most important person you
[2:01:15] need to pray for pray for your pastor
[2:01:17] and the spiritual leaders in the church
[2:01:19] because them you ought to be able to
[2:01:21] depend on
[2:01:23] everything else you can't depend on
[2:01:25] that's right you can depend on nothing
[2:01:26] else
[2:01:27] amen so let's bow our heads
