to get through a few a few more days this week amen they call this Wednesday hump day amen but hopefully amen it's a blessing to you tonight maybe the day was a hump day for you to maybe a little hump to kind of spring you through the rest through the word amen by the word praise the Lord Jesus appreciate the Lord and and we just thank God for his blessings let's just go ahead and go to the word tonight um Joshua chapter one turn to Joshua chapter one I don't want to keep you all too long this evening but uh hopefully it's a little a word of encouragement this evening amen praise God Amen we're just still we're still here at the beginning of the year and and sometimes you know Satan just wants to bring discouragement in and wants to bring bring uh um make you lose strength you see make you lose hope make you lose uh uh Focus amen but I'm reminded here in Joshua chapter 1 of someone that uh that had had a lot some big shoes to fill amen and uh and that was this thing that God told him four different times and the third time the fourth time actually was the people telling him at the end so let's just read about that this evening in Joshua chapter 1. now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you notice that he says it all in the past because it's already theirs amen as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong verse six be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them amen let's just borrow heads this evening our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word and we ask you heavenly father that through your word Lord God not through my words not through father God any of my opinions Lord but through your word father you'd bless your people father Lord may you forgive us for all of our sins any anything that we may have failed you and Lord this day father forgive us cleanse us place it all under the blood of Jesus Christ Lord for father we are frail and we make many mistakes but oh Lord how thankful we are for that fresh blood Lord God that we can always Lord turn to father and we can always hide ourselves under Lord not our not our righteousness not anything that we could ever done Lord for our righteousness is ours filthy rags before you but Heavenly Father Lord God you prepared righteousness before us Lord and it was through your blood shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray now Lord God that you bless your people now meet every need amongst us father and just have your way here tonight we pray I commit myself now unto you in Jesus Christ's name a amen you may be seated this evening praise the Lord amen good to see Michael here tonight praise God amen good to see all of you here tonight praise the Lord Jesus amen so we see here that in Joshua chapter one and and I encourage you all to uh I encourage you all to to read the whole book of Joshua you know brother Branham many many times especially in the adoption series he he talked about the book uh he would go back to the Book of Joshua and how he would parallel How Joshua parallels Ephesians Ephesians Paul talking about bringing us into uh claiming our our our our inheritance amen what God had already given you amen so Paul amen lays out exactly what that's what he was trying to bring to the Ephesians which of course amen that was for us also in this day it was the letter to the Ephesians but it was a letter for for every Christian praise God and so our inheritance in this day amen is is is is the holy spirit is the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord Jesus and so just as Joshua here in in at this time amen do you know this you know the the background of what they've gone through Amen to Abraham it was promised a hundreds years before amen that they would inherit a land and they would obtain a land and they would go and take a land and they was promised to him he said I will give you this land and and and that the number of the people that that of your of your descendants will be like the stars and we'll be like the sand in other words uncountable amen and it was a promise that was given to Abraham and Abraham Abraham didn't have to do anything but just say Lord you said it I believe it and just move on praise God that was Abraham without a Bible at that time that was Abraham without any any message books at that time that was Abraham without anything other than what he had heard God say amen and we have message books we have the word we have everything amen at our fingertips and sometimes we can't we have a hard time trusting God amen every single part of the word amen there's encouragement there's promises laying here for you that are good they were not just good for them but they're good for you now praise the Lord that you can walk upon amen and you can say Lord that's for me I take it and I claim it and just move on upon it amen that's how God wants you to do in this hour amen he don't want you to pitter-patter or or say but Lord but but but my situation no hey there's no situation amen too hard for God let me ask you this is there anything too hard for God the Bible says that amen so there's nothing all we can do is just take God at his word praise the Lord that's the best thing that's that's the best thing that you can do for God I heard someone recently I think it was brother Bob back in Nicaragua he said that's the best thing that you can do to please the Lord amen and it's just take God at his word amen praise the Lord so here's hundreds of years later and Moses comes on the scene amen because God was going to fulfill his word and here comes Moses on the scene and and and we all know the story they went through Egypt slaves for for over 400 years and then Here Comes Moses delivers the people and now Moses is tasked amen with taking the people to this Promised Land amen and and so if if it comes to a point where Moses wasn't able to take him in Praise the Lord because we see here in Joshua chapter 1 it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass praise the Lord Jesus amen and so it types it this types to me it types A lot a lot of what we have gone through and this is our day amen who was our Moses of our time amen the prophet brother Branham was our Moses praise God he typed different characters in The Bible one of those was Moses amen and so it says here now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass praise the Lord and we see here that Moses was dead amen just as our Prophet amen he's gone off the scene a lot of people are trying to resurrect them back again put them back in the Pulpit by playing the tapes at the church and all that which that's fine I mean we do it here but I'm just saying they actually literally believe that brother Branham is there speaking to them and to me that looks that seems to me like spiritualism I don't I don't know I don't know what else to call that spiritualism and that's our day amen because they're trying to put a man to live when he's gone off the scene brother Branham it wasn't brother Brandon's word it was God's word through brother Branham praise the Lord so that's where we're feeding off in this hour and so after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord I mean God said that he was dead amen he was dead brother Branham he's gone passed away he fulfilled what he was supposed to do amen it does does does it does not do us any good amen to to to to to uh venerate amen the the the things of of his you know uh His Ho his his belt or his boots or anything like that that does you no good amen if you don't obey the word that he preached that's what he would want you to do amen praise God so after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua amen and so Joshua in this our day we know he types the Holy Spirit even the name Joshua comes from the Hebrew word Yeshua amen which means Jesus our savior amen so it's very interesting that God actually makes Joshua amen a type of what Jesus was to us amen and who is Jesus the Holy Spirit and who is the Holy Spirit he's God Amen praise the Lord Jesus so it's it it's the same person and that's the person that's leading the church in this hour amen praise God it's the Holy Spirit working through the church amen working individually amen but working through a people Amen in order to do great things in this hour in order to fulfill his word how else is he going to fulfill his word amen if it isn't through a people praise God I'm just happy I'm just glad that that God God can use me God can use you Amen to fulfill his word now you say you might say well I don't know what kind of word he wants to fulfill through me I can't do any sort of big Miracles I can't I don't know what to do amen but but what about the word where it says it says husbands amen love your wives foreign of God how about the word that says and and wives respect your husbands isn't that the word of God well that's what God wants you to fulfill but that's the hard part that's the hard part when it comes oh my we we just it's it's wonderful laying hands on people and and and and and and praying for them and just thinking about great miracle things but when it talks about husbands love your wives and and and and and wives make sure to respect your husbands right I don't even know why I'm on this but it's Valentine's week so let's let's let's break that down a little bit you know you know the Bible does say husbands love your wives and and wives make sure to respect your husbands why why does it say that why doesn't it say wives make sure to love your husbands right because I know my wife loves me but I need to reassure her that I love her see wives need that reassurance but husbands don't really need that but that's why Paul carefully used the word respect see what we Thrive off of is respect right respect is what we need amen because when you respect that you're gonna get that love that just automatically comes with the with the territory and man you respect your your your your husband amen he'll do anything for you he knows you love him you don't need to show that or affection then that's and that's good and husbands when your wife is trying to show you that affection you need to be you need to accept that and receive that because remember in doing that you're showing her love right so it's Gotta it's got to work yeah it's got to work each each and every you know uh that way yeah and and and and then you know the the relationship it can just move good amen but there's problems that arise when when couples amen and and and married couples they they lose respect for one another and then they and then what turns out is that love starts declining in their lives as well and it's because they're not doing what Paul said to do so there is a word right there that you could you can go ahead and apply tonight when you get home and you can say Lord You're fulfilling your word through my life Hallelujah isn't that wonderful praise the Lord you know me I just like to bring things down home amen that you can take something home tonight and apply it tonight amen that's just what I like but you see God wanted to use Moses uh uh Joshua amen because Moses was off the scene amen and now it was time for someone to take the people into the promised land Joshua was with Moses amen doing learning and and and serving Moses all of this all of this time and he's gotten to a point now where God Amen has confidence in him amen where God can can put Joshua in a position where he he knows that he will obey what God tells him to do amen and so Joshua is here at this point and he's he it's scary just put yourself in his shoes it was a scary thing for Joshua amen with over 2 million people maybe I don't know exactly how many people were with him but it was a lot of people that he had to lead and he had to fill Moses's shoes in order to take the land that God had already given them but that's the key right there Saints that's the key and he he had to grab they had to take hold of the word that God had already given them throughout the years which was the land is yours I've given you this land it's yours just go and possess it amen and here comes the moment when they're getting ready to do that in verse 2 it says and Moses my servant is dead so he says it again now therefore arise amen go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel you know many times in in in in hymns before uh you can we're seeing some sometimes hymns and and they they type Jordan with with death and and and and and and dine but but when you look at what happened here it wasn't really a it wasn't really a death amen it was actually it's when they needed to start living out their life after after they crossed it was actually when when they crossed over it was hardships that that took place they had to start fighting for real then amen it wasn't Rosy and that's the same thing with you and I Saints amen it's when you become a Christian that you have to start fighting then before it was easy before it was it wasn't hard to say no to the cigarette and say no to the to the to to the to the blunt or to the weed or to the or to the cocaine bag or or whatever amen it was easy for you to take that in and and and say yeah but now amen something has worked started working in your life now there's a struggle yeah I always say if you're not struggling if you're not fighting something spiritually is not right there either God hasn't started something in your life or you just haven't come to it amen when you become a Christian amen when this when the Holy Spirit is worked in your life and is working in your life amen it becomes a it becomes a struggle becomes it becomes a fight then and who is going to win the one that you feed the most the black dog and white dog and then it's the one that that you feed the most is the one that wins Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise God tells Joshua go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel watch verse 3 every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given you amen every promise that God has made in his word that have I given you in other words amen every family member that I have given you amen that have I given you amen everything that God has promised you amen is yours just to rise and take it and believe it and just move on with it and you'll see it take place Hallelujah every place at the sole of your foot shall tread upon amen and you see it treading upon amen it wasn't just just staying in one place I'm gonna stay right here and that's it God promise God promised me yeah God promised you that part amen but God promised you more than that too why don't you go and take it but sometimes words stay still and we do and we've failed to realize the the the the the what's really out there for us amen we hunker down on one word we hunker down on one Doctrine or we hunkered down on one on one thing and that and that's it I'm not moving from this amen but it's but it's every word of God Amen is profitable and it's good for you and it's a promise for you amen if you can just take it accept it walk upon it amen it takes Faith Amen to move your foot and just move on to something that you don't even you don't know what's beyond the the those borders but that is what God is telling Joshua to do amen he's telling him to rise and every place that the soul your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you and watch as I said unto Moses wasn't Moses someone that you looked up to in other words Joshua right he obeyed my word or he he he he he he stayed with my promise he was looking to that promise yeah he had hardships he had struggles he had times where unbelief try to creep in if God is Lord why is this happening why is it didn't you promise amen but I kept my word all my promises amen you guys crossed the Red Sea I killed Egyptians for you in the middle of the sea amen I caused flies to come I cussed all kinds of pestilence to the Egyptians I did it so you have nothing to to worry about just listen to that word don't you think that brother Branham didn't struggle Amen to give us this word that we look that we that we enjoy this day amen I thank God that he did that he went through the things that he did because I learned lessons from that I take I I take I take from that amen and I learn and I say uh I know I'm not going to do that because look what happened and that's the exact same thing that in First Corinthians I believe First Corinthians 10 Paul says that the things in the Old Testament the things happen they man for our for for us to learn from amen you know we have siblings uh you you know uh uh sometimes uh siblings they they that if the younger one you know sees the older one she gets in trouble or he gets in trouble the younger one says I ain't doing that I know what not to do I ain't talking to Mom and Dad that way yeah yeah look what happened to my older uh brother or my older sister I ain't doing that hey man it gets edged in there all right because you saw what happened amen you saw the result you saw the consequences of that Disobedience or you saw the consequences of what of of that that took place amen well these things in the Old Testament were given for your benefit so that you could say Lord you know what I ain't doing that praise God I know better look what happened amen and so God is so mindful of us amen that he gives us amen he lets other people make mistakes for your benefit isn't that isn't that amazing other people made mistakes so that you don't make them today wow thank thank God amen but sometimes you know some of us we we have to make the mistakes in order to learn we see it in the Bible wow okay then we go off and do it anyway that's that's a hard head right there that one the Lord is gonna have to uh kind of work on just a little bit more [Laughter] because why he loves you I'm so glad that he loved me Hallelujah amen mistake after mistake fall After Fall amen but God said you know what I'm not leaving you there you're one of my soldiers you're a fighter amen let me go ahead and help you get up amen and a true Soldier doesn't stay down a true Soldier a man gets back up picks up his weapon amen what is our weapon our sword the word of God and moves on keeps fighting doesn't necessarily mean that there's not going to be another obstacle in the way does it necessarily mean that there's not another battle that's gonna that's gonna come and come come about amen but the his thing is about moving on and that's what I encourage you this this evening sayings just move on you know the word of God just move on keep walking keep possessing amen and God will take the rest I guarantee you amen you know as as Sunday we were we were talking uh brother Bob was mentioning with regards when we were in heading to Nicaragua and we got to a point there on that Wednesday when we left we were at the Atlanta airport and then the FFA thing came came out where they grounded all the planes and in our mind we're thinking okay well we'll just we'll just uh uh our plane from Atlanta to Houston is delayed that's fine but when we got to Houston that's when we all kind of started wondering like Lord is this really your will and then we got these we I get we got all these doubts we got all these all these all this uh all these things bombarding our mind as we're sitting standing three four hours in a line to talk to the customer service United customer service counter to see if they have when is our next flight that we can fly from Houston to to Nicaragua and we're there talking with each other and we're saying well if this don't happen then whatever then what we'll just tell them hey let's just take us back just send us back to Atlanta you know it's whatever but I I I got them together and I and I said I I said listen I I you know God brought us this far amen and there's a reason why amen God grounded planes that day amen and so let's just move on Amen with what we are we know we are tasks to do amen and God will take care of the rest I I don't know what it was you know we were hungry we were we were starving but we needed to get to that counter to see if they had some some flights a flight for all of us to get to and and uh when we got there we asked him we said listen it's eight of us that are flying and we really want to be together do you have a flight soon that we can fly to Nicaragua from Houston and miraculously they had a flight on Friday with eight seats available eight seats exactly what we needed so at that point we knew okay Lord you do want us to go but it's it's disheartening it's discouraging you see because we got we missed two days where we could have been uh the brother brother Bob was was supposed to minister on that Wednesday uh evening when we got there and and Thursday as well it was two days where we didn't get to minister but why did God allow that God knows and you know what the only thing I can think of is is maybe somebody who helped us at the hotel this those two evenings or even the place where we ate that fine barbecue there in Houston uh there was a young man that he Bob showed us a picture that that was so nice to us made us laugh it just made us feel so comfortable didn't he Michael so so so so good he was good to the bride and maybe because of that he might get an eternal life I don't know he was really good to us sit there talk to us and and and and and and and and just had just had some camaraderie with my wife about Filipinos and and and things like that and just and you know what we'll never forget that and we'll never forget him and maybe God grounded a plane just for him amen maybe God grounded remember when God grounded an airplane with brother Brandon to get on Just for that the shunamite woman that's that lady in Tennessee maybe God grounded us amen so that we can go eat barbecue at that place and that that that that guy amen get eternal life some sometime later on in life you know at the white Throne judgment I don't know but that's in God's hands but Joshua amen is is is is is in a position right now where he all he can do is say Lord you promised Moses and I just moved forward and that's what God wants him to do amen from the Wilderness and this Lebanon verse 4. even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great seed toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee let me just bring it down to our day as I was with brother Branham so will I be with thee amen as I was with you put a name there so will I we be with thee you mean even in this day that we're living in this crooked age that we're living in this this dark hour that we're living in yes this day praise God because God promised it and he his word never fails amen they're shown as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and so watch in verse 6 be strong and of good courage I looked up the word strong and and it's defined this way this is what the word strong is able to withstand great force or pressure let me say that again able to withstand great force or pressure now this is the first time here in this in this in this chapter that God tells tells Joshua that tells them to be strong I mean Joshua don't you think that Joshua didn't display strength already I mean he told the sun to stand still told the moon to stand still he he fought great battles won them he did all kinds of great things and he God knew that he Joshua was going to be was going to come to a point of fear amen you might have had great things happen in your life you might have seen wonderful great Miracles take place amen but it might come down to something in your life amen where you don't know how to get past that amen maybe sickness is declining uh your health is declining maybe uh your your children or or whatever it may be you come to a point now where God Amen knows that you were going to get there you were going to be at that point but I tell you this day amen just as God told Joshua be strong and very courageous amen in other words you are able to withstand great force or pressure amen what what kind of age that this is amen uh compared to other ages amen the pressure and the force that's upon the people of God and it's getting worse and worse and worse mentally psychologically amen uh it's just it's it's wickedness in every corner amen is one thing you know seeing things in every corner but now it's just mind battles constantly constantly mind battles going through your mind going through amen and but God even in this day tells you be strong and very courageous is this word not good for this day this the same thing and so and so the word courage this is it means the ability to do something that frightens one amen or strength in the face of pain or grief mm-hmm that's the word courage amen sometimes we don't know where how to make take the next step amen when when when when when the pressing moments and and and things come and hit you Amen in your life in an unexpected way that you didn't even think it was going to be that way amen but God tells you to be strong and take and be of good courage amen doesn't matter what it is I know there's battles ahead in my life that I'm gonna have to face but I'm gonna have to be strong and take courage because this word that God's given us this word that God's given you this word that that you have come to amen you can't just leave it to the side and say and say I I give up amen what is that gonna do that's not gonna bring that's not going to bring your family member back that's not going to bring amen anything positive amen the only thing you can do amen is be strong and take good courage and move forward amen that that right there amen might just be the changed amen that somebody else needs to see in your darkest moment in your darkest hour amen you took strength and you took courage in the word amen and somebody saw that yes and it helped him praise God so Joshua is told be strong and and and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide you will divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them and then he tells them again when God says something once twice more than twice that means pay attention because God knew that he was going to be under great pressure only be thou strong and very courageous and now he tells them very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all that the message says the law praise God you see now the law a man it could only come to a certain point the law couldn't really take them take them in amen the law can can uh can put you in prison as brother Branham said amen but it's the holy spirit amen that can give you Freedom amen now the law is is good they are up to a certain point but it condemns you it calls you and says hey you did wrong you deserve this punishment amen but the holy spirit is the one that gives Grace praise the Lord and I'm so thankful for grace in this hour amen so Moses could only take him up to a certain point because he was a representative of the law amen now Joshua the holy spirit is the one to take them over and desire only be thou strong very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right or to the left in other words don't get carried away by all wins a Doctrine amen amen amen stay balanced stay focused praise God because that is how people get get get sidetracked this day they go off on the shiny shiny what is a shiny syndrome shiny thing syndrome oh my this seems good look at this look what this brother's preaching goodness gracious oh my look at the way he preaches look at the way and then forgetting amen what God what why they even started serving the lord in the first place and then they find themselves amen following a man or a movement instead of the word yeah oh it's happened so many times throughout all these years amen you see it in the nominal world and you see it in the in the message too but God is telling the people in this hour amen amen stay balanced stay focused amen stay strong amen don't move over to the right don't move over to the left amen stay focused because that's the only way that the word amen will have an effect in your life and in other people's life don't get unbalanced don't get unfocused don't go with Fantastics as brother Brandon would say fantastic say man wow but what about the word of God amen what about the word it doesn't matter how many people raised from the dead it's such and such a church amen if the word isn't preached amen I want to stay with the word because the word amen that fantastic ain't gonna change my body but the word will change my body amen faith in the word will change my body Fantastics won't change my body Fantastics amen will help my body feel good for a little bit will help me jump around and and shout and good and and all that amen but after it's all said and done I'm just I'm just all sweaty yeah and I still I still got problems with my with in my body and stuff my body ain't changed amen but faith in the word will change my body amen faith in the word will amen it's just encouraging you this evening Saints amen don't don't get carried away with the Fantastics and I know here amen we're we're a solid group and I know you've seen those things we we know amen we've seen it throughout the year brother Dale I know you've seen it throughout the years amen when people get carried away with the Fantastics of the message and forget the reason why the message why we follow the message amen praise the Lord it says here which Moses my servant commanded the etern not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest you want Prosperity preaching that's that's it right there it's the best Prosperity verse ain't talking about money either young people listen to me you you want to be effective in life you want Direction in your life you want to uh be a better person uh um a better Christian some of us are coming into or just got married or coming into marriage amen you wanna you're thinking about how to be a good wife or a good husband and and you're coming to that point amen turn not from the left or to the right from this word let this word be what guides you and your partner amen let this be let that be the standard in your home and you will prosper whether so ever thou goest whether it be a church whether it be a home whether it be at work amen it doesn't matter amen if the word of God is forced and foremost in your life amen you will prosper and you may not Prosper uh financially God will prom promise he will give you what you need that I mean that's a word that's a Word of Promise amen he promised it in his word he said he I will not leave you comfortless amen and he will provide for us amen but sometimes amen we need what we need is prosperity spiritual prosperity over physical prosperity amen praise God some of us need that more so young people what are you putting more ahead of God in your life amen is is reading the word of God is is dedicating yourself to prayer is that going to lead you to the point that you desire to get to I believe it can right amen but what other things are you putting ahead of him you know what those things are what is hindering your life from moving forward amen you can name it from A to Z amen so let let you you just take a look at that in your life praise the Lord amen just give me just a few more minutes this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous look he says prosperous again you want prosperity amen that's right written right here and then Thou shalt have good success good success in this case it was Joshua amen going to go take the land going to go for fulfill the promises that God had already made to the Father Abraham amen but what is what is it in your case hey man I want to have a successful marriage I want to have a successful uh uh uh score in my exam my final exam I want to have a successful career I want to have a successful if you're an entrepreneur I want to be I want to be a successful entrepreneur I want to be a successful Minister I want to be a successful deacon amen I want to be a successful mother you put your yourself right there that is the that is the the path to follow right there that is the formula do not stray away from this word amen this is simple as that amen Don't Stray away from the word but I'll be the first one to tell you amen that I I get in trouble when I Stray away from the word and put otherworldly things ahead of the word of God you don't feel right you feel backslidden you feel you feel uh ashamed that you you feel and that's the reason why sometimes we don't even want to come to church because you put something else ahead of God and so you feel condemned and you feel backslidden and you don't feel like you can be in front of the people at the church amen but when you put the word of God before you amen you will have good success when the word of God is before you when the word of God is more important than anything else in your life you know a few months ago I talked about that how how important is the word of God to you do you even read the word do you even talk about the word amen do you even share the word amen is it that important to you or is it only just when we come to church that it's important yeah praise God now in in finishing off and you can read the rest of the chapter look at Verse 18 it says whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment this is the people talking to Joshua and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou command is him he shall be put to death only be strong and of good courage so they're telling him the same thing that Joshua was sharing with them that God told him to tell them amen so they got the word praise God now just real quick if you turn to Joshua chapter 3. they've come to a point now where they're getting ready to cross and it says here in verse 1 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and removed and they removed from shiddom and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel enlarged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it in other words what they're commanding the people to do is that when you see the Ark of the Covenant amen right that right over there when you see that being lifted up amen because that represents the word of God it represents many things right the word of God was being carried there it says when you see that first and then you see the priests the Levites bearing it then it's time for you to move amen because and this to me represents amen the the the fivefold ministry in this hour amen the faithful Ministry holds the Ark of the Covenant amen holds the ark amen they don't hold their own Ark they don't hold their own thing their own ideas or their own thoughts amen they only hold amen this word praise God and so the people were had to stand still unless they saw that word move ahead before them if the word don't say it you don't move if the word amen is not held before you amen you stand still right man if you don't understand something you stay still don't go off wondering let's say when are they going to move that Ark you know you just moved amen it's like like kind of kind of like freeze tag amen or Simon says yeah Simon Says and then you don't move until Simon Says right and Simon Says then then you do this then you move right but brother so and so said do this but Simon didn't say so so I ain't moving right how many like playing Simon Says amen and it gets people every time amen move your arm how Simon didn't say [Laughter] you're out that was the people here they were not supposed to move until that Ark of the Covenant was before them amen and in this day amen the Ark of the company is being by a five-fold Ministry in this hour amen it isn't the perfecting the the FIFA Ministry can't perfect you the Bible says by the Perfection but I can't perfect you neither can brother away neither can brother Dale neither can brother Bob or brother Aaron I can't perfect you I can only lift up the ark so that you can do it and then you have to take a a hold and start walking amen that's what brings your perfection amen I can only preach the word to you it's up to you if you want to go and Obey it I can only lift up the word Amen brother Wade can only lift up the word brother Dale can only lift up the word amen always that's all we can do it's up to you to see if you want to go home and Obey it in order to have good success praise God and so we should be we should be patient and we should be we should be uh have uh I think I'm listening the word of what I'm looking patient in other words discipline them amen to not move unless the word of God says amen praise God yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way heretofore amen there's things that we haven't come to it this at this Junction in time amen we we some of these things especially after 2020 some of these things are new to us traveling new grounds amen and sometimes we want to make certain assumptions and we want to make certain uh uh uh ideas about certain things amen but what does the word of God say amen that's where I want to stay hey man that that is that is what I am uh tasked to do is to look at that at that word because it's that word that's going to lead me through amen and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over before the people remember the Ark of the Covenant representing the word and pass before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee now I like that I like that there in the sense that even though it was the priests holding up the word it was still God working on the scene [Laughter] amen it wasn't the priest doing it the whole time or doing the miracle it was it was the whole thing was led by God but it was dependent upon them if they were going to obey amen that word or not you know what if the people said what if the priests took up the the ark and the people were like standing right there and then the the priest walked by them and they're like wait wait a second hold on a second you know getting ahead God wasn't then God was not going to be able to do what he was supposed to do what he wanted to do sometimes we think that we could get ahead of the ministry and we can we can uh we can put one over them in other words we're a little smarter than them you know but God called them for that position not you for that position amen and so all you can do is stay Amen in your position because I can't fulfill your position and you can't fulfill mine amen and the ministry man is one that ministered you see this is this was a task a heavy task for these ministers to do carrying carrying the it wasn't like that I'll tell you that it wasn't that size yeah this is good probably about this size or maybe more way weighed a lot and they had to walk you can just read the rest of the chapter where we're getting ready to finish walk through the through the through uh to the banks amen and they were get to the point I mean they they didn't know if if the river was gonna was gonna they were gonna walk on dry ground or not amen but they were just obeying what God Said walking with that heavy word amen and that's what a true minister is he labors for you amen he he's here to minister to you that's that's what a minister is he's here for you not to minister to him is for him to minister to you that's what a true minister is I'll always say that you know and I'll never forget that whenever you look at this picture when we're washing feet amen that was the greatest Minister that ever has been is the Lord Jesus Christ and he got down to watch some dirty feet amen greatest preacher ever and he humbled himself that's what a true Minister does he humbles himself hey man he's humble and and and he's Meek and he always holds the word of God before the people amen so it you read the rest of the chapter at a point they come and God Departed the waters and they crossed through Dry ground amen but they had to obey the word of God first you want to see miracles in your life be strong and very courageous stay in your place let God Amen obey what God Said in his word and God will take care of the rest you want to see your heart your your loved ones saved stay in your place stay in the word amen you want to prosper in your life stay in your place stay focused stay focused on what God has given you know sometimes we might think the grass is greener on the other side oh it's better it's prettier it's nicer at that church but you don't you don't know why the whole reason why you're here there's something that you've got to fulfill here otherwise you'd be there and if you can't do it here you're not going to be able to do it there you see oh but but brother such and such is such a church I mean he preaches very nice and he look at the way he he ministers I mean he's he's calm and you know he's amen but how are you dealing with it now maybe God is trying to teach you through the ministry here for something personally to you that you need to fix yourself amen so God is telling you hey there's a little something in your life that you need to minister to you need you need to work out in your life and I'm using that church over there to to grind at you that way so that you can get to where I need you to get husband because the way you are at this church it'll be the same way you will be over there hey it won't change it's a it's a personal problem that you carry everywhere you go that's why we have some people here there's Church hoppers and they're never satisfied because they think the problem is with the preacher or the church but the problem they're carrying it themselves they are the problem and they don't need that problem in their church I guarantee you that so God put you here amen so that you can be perfected through this ministry amen and I'm thankful amen I'm thankful that that you know sometimes you you you ask yourself Lord you led me this way and and and and and and and and you wonder about things in life and you may not know all the answers to everything neither did Joshua he didn't understand everything all he could take hold was the promise that God gave Moses and that's all you can do in this hour take a hold of the word that God's given our Moses that God has given Paul has given all the different all the different ones in the Bible they were there for your example for you to grow to come to the stature of a perfect man amen you believe that praise the Lord let's stand to our feet [Applause] be strong and very courageous amen as the musicians come let's just let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word Lord maybe this is where chopped up words father but I pray Lord that you would make him come to the exact place where they needed to fall Lord and that they would take fruit for that they would take uh take take take a hold heavenly father of someone and and it may change them Lord God and to move and draw closer to you Lord Jesus we ask heavenly father that you would just continue to minister all the needs amongst us Lord we think of sister Freda and we think father God of of of maybe the uncertainty that probably probably Lord plaguing her mind throughout all these these different weeks father God lord is the same uncertainty that Joshua had Lord maybe it wasn't through with his health but father in in a place in a position of uncertainty father and Satan would want us want us to be fearful about fear paralyzes you Lord but father God courage Lord Jesus doesn't take away fear oh but Lord father God it helps dissipate fear fear away it helps you to be strong against fear and so I pray that you would help her Lord and I pray that you would help all the other ones that are struggling with their health lordy or I'm remembering Lord sister Rosa this this tonight Lord God she's still in the hospital Lord Jesus and we know the Lord God that you can raise her up father God and Lord Jesus I pray to be with brother Lucas there in the church father there in Honduras Lord precious Brothers their heavenly father and I asked Lord that you would just bless and minister to them in this hour Lord God Lord bless your people here this
