Heavenly Father we thank you Lord this afternoon that you've given us this time that we can gather together and we can Fellowship around you and Lord we just invite you to come this afternoon and not be an onlooker of her her doings and all and a recorder but to be a preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives because that's our desire our prayer Lord is the center of Revival among us to revive each and every Hearts because we know a Revival is not to revive Sinners the revivalist to revive Christian the Lord that have been in the way and then Sinners will see that fire burning in their hearts and their lives and they'll they'll come to the fire and and get saved themselves and then they'll have a Revival life we love you and we thank you just have your way remember the sick ones Among Us and just bless each and everyone in Jesus name amen Revelations one and then we'll go to Revelations 19. this is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave them to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signifies it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God under the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein or the time is at hand right okay in Revelation 19. one Drew about verse 9. and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven I noticed in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he has judged the great which had corrupted earthquake or fornication and that the means the blood of his servants at her hands it's all done finished and again he said Hallelujah her smoke rose up forever and ever amen and the Four and Twenty Elders I notice who's here four in 20 Elders so that would be in this situation that would be your Old Testament Saints right and your 12 apostles see of the New Testament all right the four beasts fell down to worship God that said on the throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God for praise our God all ye servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and as I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude it is the voice of many Waters never Waters of people in that right and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God and never turn right around and said thousands of Little Voices thundering out the word of the Lord right let's be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and noticed and to her was granted me that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine lineness of righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God he may be seated the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word now immediately you see that in your reading there it says after these things all right after these things we'll read it in a second after Revelations 18 4. after come out of her right amen then you can see this happening in heaven because that's where it's at it's not a situation on Earth we have been through those things to cover the uh the things that happened to the ones who reject the word to turn down the word would mean that you would be rejected and you'd be a part of those people that will have to come over and uh to a 20th chapter I think is the next it comes to their 20 yeah 20. and it will talk about the uh you know you know but this is here at this situation in Revelations 19. now put it in your this in your mind we won't get to it tonight this afternoon but we will eventually go on into it Revelations 19 is coming back in the Millennium right all right that is the right into the Millennium but before that can happen you've got to cover verse 7 more of this group of people to be ready you'll be going to just jump on over more that's a great ride in this doing them and they've got a big ride and preachers that preached out we're going to come back down and we're going to fight well you know with people and like I asked you the other day what kind of a battle would it be you know I mean you're going to fight literal people but you're going to have eternal people fighting literal people now wouldn't that be fun and it wouldn't need to be nothing it wouldn't take but one person to just speaks the word and they're all gone it's not no it's not that away it's what we have conceived right there because of a ride of a victory or whatever but when you're riding in a victory ride the enemy is already defeated amen I mean that's what I thought right you know I I didn't think you went out and and cut Donuts at a racetrack Before the Race started I thought it was supposed to be after the race was over with and you're taking a Victory lap you know and you you're you know but that's the way people think but anyhow you said after these things all right after all that we've talked about for weeks and months and things how these things off of the uh situation of people in the tribulation period in all that will be will come upon Mankind and and it'll be a horrible thing we went through all of those things covering the the situations like that and I know we didn't do justice or didn't stay on it long enough but at least we could get enough to understand all right and then I've always understood that the bride goes up in Revelations 4 1 there you know amen where John was taken up as a type and not seen until this 19th Chapter you know and coming back with Christ all right and then see people will go into over what about 10-7 what about 18-4 you know come out over my people we're going to read in a minute that brought around said after this 18 4. you know after this come out of her my people all right I hope you caught this morning and have been with me long enough to understand that I believe the seals and things like that are to Israel amen but the Revelation is to you and I that's right but the first COC started back in Genesis and it wrote all the way through and it's still writing and actually is not into full manifestation even at this time because that would be the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God and we're supposed to be out of here in the Rapture before that transpires all right and then like the force fields it would start back there with a battle with uh Cain and Abel and things like that and would consummate or end up in the life's days in the battle that would come down to Armageddon and we certainly don't want to be there because that would be in the tribulation period but yet we as the bride of Christ can see these things and how they lead up to that see it didn't start out as a an antichrist it started out as a Deeds of Nicholas then he becomes a doctrine of the Nicolaitans right he didn't start out uh a pope or a priest or a Prophet he'd have to start out and just gradually work its way in to that situation well we're here during that period of time so then reading the Bible we can see a compound meaning out of it that it can mean these things but yet we can feed it because we can see how it's beginning to happen and it has a compound meaning to you and I of course come out of her my people right right that's for you and I mean as I said this morning ended it up there won't be a Revelations 19 ride if we don't come out of her right that's right and get into him I remember I was introducing the message to a manner at work and her whole group of them and you know when I've been kind of dealing with them and everything and they start doing a little preaching and talking and and this one man he I guess he'd heard enough of it and he'd said you know everybody's talking about come out of her come out of her he said when we gonna get into him and I said well he's at least he's caught on to what's what I'm trying to do you know you know I hope you know that now you can take and go back for about three months and listen to these tapes coming down because this is the service that it's pointing to to you know that we'll get to it in a minute the Lord willing to come out of her my people and then what the bride the wife right right that's made herself ready all right see that way these things we must come out of we must come out of man's ideas we must come out of of organized religion we must come out of things but we don't have to be kind of like a man in a church one time they they put up a little heading up there what their church was and it was so and so so and said org you know you know how you do that on the computer you got org well this man had been in the church I don't know exactly how long but he's been there quite as many years well he just got up and walked out and he said I ain't having nothing to do with organized religion well that was on the computer then said in that organization org you know on the computer but see that's the way we think we're right well you know what that person was because nobody else would have probably agreed with him or thought about that kind of a way so he was his own or RG he had become his own organization himself by thinking of what that was right we see we think we're so right you know until we'll stand and do whatever turn against everything yeah but now listen as I said when he would look at it see they ended up I did with with the point that the about the last verse 23 there of the 18th chapter it shows coming down to Great destruction that will happen and I was reading to you a word that wrote around said they would be bombs fall on the Vatican right to annihilate it I told you if you read the scripture then it says that they the merchants were living back away you know that that their gold and silver that's all over there it's just burnt up there's nobody wanting it because he's too dangerous you know to move over any closer and also they back away and and actually even more in the scripture says for the fact of the great City why because they lose everything right see you say what what would that matter about that well the gold is the economy right right everybody's on the gold standard and everyone who backs that up is the people that own you you know they don't brother Dave I'm free that's like Israel when they said to Jesus said we're under bondage to no man you know that description right amen and Romans out there killing them for what right but boy they thought we're free we've never been under bondage you'll be under bondage to your own self that's right you see ending It Up by saying to show that that the the bride is not there you wonder why I keep relating to something because I relate to it to make that dig into your brain all right first into the head okay from chapter four to chapter 19 is only three and a half years period of time right which is called the tribulation here in Jacob's trouble amen all right now then when it ends the ending of chapter 18 was what and The Voice of the bridegroom yep and divorce for the bride is no longer heard in her the world see this world system the religious system why because she done been taken out she was not there into this tribulation this period of Destruction you know in all that we've been talking about for right you know for months and months and see I'm sure it was boring to some of you but but this now you can look back and say hey wait a minute this was the foundation to be able to come over and say and understand come out of her my people you got to know what to come out of us that's right right or you get your coat and hat and move houses you know and just go to another church oh Lord you know boy and I've always told you I never introduced any of you to the message he's going to the house by trying to tell you the Catholic church was wrong and the Baptist was wrong and the message this was wrong and right I didn't do it that way I approached you on the godhead others dealt with those things but I approached you on the godhead but I've seen a lot of things I've seen that people who come out of organized religion because they believe organized religion is wrong brother Whidbey had a good point said to get you out with a hot dog did they just get you in with a hamburger somebody come along with something sounds a little better and you'll just flop right to it yeah but if you get people on the revealed word the revelation of the one true and living God right see then you won't be fighting organized religion trying to find out what it is when you're sitting in the middle of it right you'll be seeing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you'll see him alive that's my goal all right now so what is it then after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven right now if this is in heaven and you know and even Schofield and his notes of it he's showing you that this is the glorified Saints you know coming down through there he even speaks of it that way himself right yeah and see then you come down to see but this button remember it's in heaven see the Rapture took place in 4-1 right so the bride is in heaven when you see the bride in Revelation 5 she's in heaven that's right six hell's about the thing drops to Earth to give you Earthly scenes and Earthly happenings and and what's going on on Earth for that tribulation period but see now the bride is in glory the Rapture has come now I'm going to say it so listen if the Rapture has come you know hear this situation there will be a time it'll come right amen and you know what that means that means the wife has already made herself ready right right when you're coming down here it's just a a statement of being glad and rejoiced because it is not that we go into rapture and then we have to be taught something to make us a wife when we go out here in a Rapture it's the why has made herself ready you see a wife signifies a a woman of of uh in other words marital maturity right right man whereas a bride can be just engaged you know right they're the engagement we're getting the marriage to divorce when we finish this but if we ever get finished but anyhow but it comes to a wife it's not a little uh let's see let me go back and pick up something I don't want to drop a lot of time but you remember in the the book of of the songs of Solomon right and the songs of Solomon you hear a lot about it wrote around says that is referring to the bride and he is the bridegroom and and the different things happening but you'll notice when you get on over into the songs of Solomon you'll find a little sister is referred to that instead of a little sister and forgive me for quoting scripture but it is scripture and says she has no breast why would it emphasize that but yet it turns around as to the bride referring and says we'll build on her I remember brother uh for the Howard Carroll if you're ever out and he's out preaching away from his church most of the time he preaches out of the songs of Solomon I enjoyed it really good but see that little sister it says the bride see referring and the groom the first said we'll build on her well I think that's what's happening in the end time if the Bible's right that they without us cannot be made perfect amen which doesn't mean that we will raise them up and preach something to them to perfect them but we will bring them to the position of those that have passed on to a body raised upon Earth you know to go up in a Rapture then because they've got to come forth all right now if that's true then everything's dependent upon this end time people and this little bride that would start out maybe as Luther Wesley Pentecost not understand too much of the word of God she would be a little young girl and yet she grows into maturity it's kind of like delete armor Meat Packing man that went out to get a wife you know and he sees her and she's not fully matured at that time she's out there doing the things and he's not ready for a wedding right he's not even thinking about a wedding but he proposes to her and goes away and comes back about a year later well you know what she's ready so that'll be the point today is is the wife that made herself ready now yours two things will be covered y'all put it up front when it says the wife hath made herself ready right now there's only one quote of that and wrote about them in the scripture where he literally said the wife is made herself ready he'll always use the bride that made herself ready so I think he's referring to the same person don't you it's just his way of expressing it all right but if she's made herself ready then she has something to do with it right amen that's right now I've always tried to preach to you as much as I understand all right I don't hold up secrets and I don't try to trick you in any way to believe something I believe that salvation is of the Lord all right and I believe that scripture now I believe it's not anything you've done or didn't do we'll ever bring you to Salvation me you or anybody I don't believe that I believe salvation is purely of the Lord amen all right but now here is what I do believe I believe that when you're born again you can call it potential you can call it Earnest parts or whatever but see when you're born again never the baby's here they're they got every parked they were born with it other than an abnormality of something to happen all right and they just all they've got to do is just keep eating to fill that out well you know what putting that in the stomach there's some wet just keep pushing them bodies out don't it and they just grow well I thought that's what Christianity was about so then using this scripture now the white the wife hath made herself I'll cover this over and over in a message soon hang on to the point see she's got something to do with it right after you were born again you have something to do with your salvation and we're not talking about getting you saved right right if you don't volunteer for these virtues to be made manifest if you don't seek God for these things you're going to die of malnutrition and you may be a baby you may be a Christian but you're going to die of malnutrition amen so you do have something to do what make yourself available he's got everything provided you don't have to go out and do anything you just believe what he's got right well I quit this and I quit that that's honorable yeah and if it's coming from a heart of a true Saint it's glorious amen I Don't Preach to be saved right I'm glad that Prophet made those things straight he said if I never preached another sermon he said I'm not going to die until now do you know how salvation on what you do in the don't do it right but he said I preached because I love him amen well how could he ever quit preaching right how can a preacher retire all right you might not understand what I was getting at this morning I'm sure you don't but yeah I'm funny anyway but I'm right I mean I try to say what the prophet said do you don't go to preacher in you don't vote for me to be a preacher right you might have voted for me to come to this church and settle down with you and preach to you but you didn't vote for whether or not I'm the preacher God places in the church right right right right well we're going to have a vote I pray a lot about that way you're saying it yeah because you might have something else in mind right now you might be trying to figure out who's who's and no it might be God see God has placed in the body so you wouldn't understand it no it's all right forget it listen Church after these things you see a great group of people it says in heaven right shouting and Glory Hallelujah because of that amen they're there he's not wondering whether you're going to make it or not amen at this time of this writing and Revelations 19 when it tracks powers see because we're not there so it's not transpired yet you understand at that time would have already been in the Merit been to the wedding supper in the marriage of the Lamb amen and then we're coming back into the millennium and that's what we're going to get to in a second because that's the difference of thoughts of people but I'm trying to not argue with people I'm trying to preach the gospel I've always tried to do that I know and I get in trouble by doing it but that's all right I don't worry about what I preached that gets me into trouble I worry about trying to get menu out of trouble right that's right it's not we're in trouble we were born in trouble to help us get out of it you know which sometimes it's about like nothing brother Howe back there he he's a great turkey hunter but I'm making a story okay brother how use him as an example because he is a great turkey hunter great deer hunter's with him in pain you know and uh last time you Kirby turkey hunting we got three Corner where's that he said you didn't see that Jack come down through there and I said I didn't see no Jake he said walk right behind you well I didn't hear it you know but I wasn't a hunter but my point is this wouldn't it be something to me to come up to him now and say now brother how you've been doing this wrong and I'm about 18 20 years old and I'm going to tell him I said now you've been doing this wrong well first off it'd be kind of silly but second off if he's really a turkey hunter and I could tell him a better way of doing it right right you getting the point amen if I could tell him about where to do it and prove it yep they then keep saying hey wait a minute let me listen to this guy right well I I think that's what the Bible has been trying to get all me and you to do amen his dude at least settle down and say I could be wrong you know right and Lord just show me I'm wrong and improve it to me and get me you know help me get rid of it and get straight yeah no that's all I'm trying to do all right but you notice now this is in heaven and there's a great proclamation in heaven but verse 4 says and there's four and twenty Elders in heaven well if it's four or Twenty Elders in heaven that means the 12 apostles and twelve Patriot arches in heaven right right amen well to my understanding the 12 apostles would represent the bride of Christ I mean if I'm wrong you know old or young come and show me how turkey hunts you know right tell me where I'm wrong that's what used to bother me for you know for well ever since I've been studying the message over 40 years the wine Revelations 5 and in other Scriptures it would be in heaven then it would have 24 elders right together because I knew that 12 of them represented the New Testament and 12 represented the Old Testament right now at this place when we're fixing to come back into the millennium ah you can do it in a minute about the marriage supper all right and in doing that there's the bride of Christ and there's the Old Testament Saints right seen in chapter five because it's 2400. okay then the Millennium is going to be to Israel so at this period of time they have evidently done been raised and come to this position and they're here in chapter 19. as to make manifest the four beasts is that combat power among the bride of Christ amen but also those combat beasts was in high are showing back in the Old Testament of the children of Israel and the way they camped and I used to preach off of that you know that they count like three three three and three right and it'd be Dan and different ones you know it's the lion the ox the man the eagle and we're all come forth and types exactly and when they started making their Journey the line had to go first and then the ox the groups the way they moved the way they're done it protected the word we'll see the note four beefs within the Old Testament just as well as the new so this can be covered old and you right amen but this is in glory fixing to come back into the millennial Reign amen something is taking place now why would it say and the wife is later separated when I said that this is in glory this is after the Rapture she'd already proven to be ready amen but it doesn't refer to a bride right it takes reference to a wife someone seasoned in the gospel remember instead of a little sister that cannot handle it too well some of the ages gone by couldn't handle the word of God right and God did not bring upon them more than they could handle right because he promised he wouldn't put anything on you that you couldn't that's right we're standing amen so no matter how hard or troubles it gets just remember he gave me more than what you can handle the Bible says it right amen so guys it may look rough but it's not but get it see it references here to who's in heaven fixing to descend and we're worshiping God getting ready but we're coming to are going to the millennial Reign we won't cover hearts of that this afternoon I just want to bring it to one point and I want you to think about it verse 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have to make herself ready now see you would agree with the approach that I made a moment I reflecting ago you would agree to the approach I made which I deliberately done that to for you to think that if this is in glory then it's not referring to the fact of the wife getting ready all right it's referring to the fact that she had already amen right yeah come on Ricky scripture why half is that past tense right made herself ready right okay well now you would amen that wouldn't you yeah but will you amen the other part where it says for the marriage with our brother marriage of the Lamb is come I know you amen that one meaning you're heading to a marriage it's come yes comes it's right there in front of you all right it doesn't mean necessarily you've totally entered therein it means it's present all right take place right all right the reason I bring that out is because something that's always bothered me and I've heard it and I know and I quoted brother random about it and everything but uh most everybody that I've heard of in the message realm they use this and they'll say well we're already married we're the bride of Christ but what do you mean brother they'll win it right across we're already married we're just going to the wedding supper you know in the sky well you know you're right but you don't have all the story we are married to Christ by the new birth he is our husband by the new bird right all right but now you're going to Discount the fact of the scripture stating here or the marriage of the lamb has come and then you get on over to verse 9 it says blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb well brother Dale that just means a spiritual Happening Here see this that's our concept but I don't believe you can get your scriptures together correctly like that I mean I'm honest I can't we were discussing the other day and we we stay quiet about the uh three comings of the Lord you know going to redeem his bride he comes to get his bride and then he comes with his bride and so we held back on that and let them go ahead but see I only wanted to ask one questions and can we cross up scripture and get a good understanding you know the coming of the Lord in many ways in many forms right do you know that in the Millennium can be called The Coming of the Lord because that's what brought around that's the Israel in the morning that's us with him going through the Millennium right all right now see that way if you take a scripturally speaking of him coming to the bride and then you take another scripture of him coming to the Israel and you put them in the same place look what you've done right amen you crossed your scripture that may not mean a thing to you but you ought to at least listen say that though I'll agree with you on that it don't sound good you may not be able to understand why it's not a way but you couldn't at least listen to somebody that says it I ain't listening to that because that gets me confused no you're already confused all right now we're going to read and show from Brother running this afternoon the whole point is we are the Bride of Jesus Christ right now right by the new birth already married to him right and we're going to the wedding supper amen one day but then we're going to show that and I hope you don't get carnal on me when I make the word England I don't have another education we're going to show that we are not married to him and we're going to a wedding in the sky and then we're going to have a marriage supper because here we have a wedding right the little supper you gathered before then our customary ways here in America as we have a wedding and then we go to the wedding supper right it may be in Israel that they have the wedding supper first I don't want I don't want care I don't argue with that they may have their wedding supper before they have the marriage I don't I'm not worried about it I'm just trying to illustrate and bring a point you see I can say we're married to Christ and prove it to you scripturally that we're married to Christ amen but turn around and prove to you that we're going to a wedding in the sky because you didn't notice the reading of the scripture if you really read it pull it up for the job let's just really read this Revelations 19. we only need verse 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready see we're going to a marriage in the sky because this is in the sky this 19 is not on Earth we're ready to start with verse one it says in heaven and don't say that heaven was looking down to earth this group of people this marriage is wedding is after 18 4. which says come out of her my people right so now let's read what the prophet had to say let's get started because I want you I want to read two quotes and one of them going one way one's going the other one now they have to come we've missed a boat right so think about it now the message why I'm against organized religion I'd be 62 11 11 11 eat paragraph two twenty notice the 19th Chapter here's the next after these things now don't get that tied up with it there's like one two three four four times in the Book of Revelation that uses after these times one of them is after the seals break one of them is after this and one of them you know a pretty early in the scripture get where he puts it Revelations 19. all right okay did you notice in the 19th Chapter after these signs watch what I asked her what answer the message I'll come out of her that's you and I right now the message the prophet's message come out of her my people right right okay after these things watch is the shout of the Bride Saints with the bridegroom going to the marriage of the Lamb now why does the Bible say the marriage of the Lamb it doesn't say marriage of the father my little boy you really are saying yeah you have a young man why did it be like twice there in chapter 19. it's the marriage of the Lamb has come now the lamb has a very special reference in the scripture in order in the Book of Revelation chapter five you find that Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes can even be called into the bride for him and what are you dealing with when you're dealing with the lamb what did what did John say behold now watch this watch with scriptures you keep it in your mind what did he say Behold the Lamb of God but did not John say behold the son of man what does that know what he said he said when he said behold the lamb he was referring to the son of man God made flesh all right so you'll catch on the second what we're talking about how close are we then brother what's the last call what's the last call to you and I come out of her not my brother that's the reason I'm against it scriptural it's not Orthodox let's talk about organized religion and then it wasn't order things right it's been proven to be false God is not in it he never was he never will be now I ain't saying that there's not people in those organizations that's where the church was made up of right right right but as long as you stay into that system what's the last four words amen you're a part of it you stay there and you're part of the system you sit right here with organized religion in your mind you're part of the system don't make no difference right right okay but look what he says he said after these things the shadow of the Bride Saints with the bridegroom what going to the marriage of the Lamb he's placing Revelations 19. I got a quote in here they say the brother said we don't understand see where is revelation where is the marriage of the Lamb places before the Triple A one he said the marriage of the Lamb that's before the millennium which is true it has to be right you because when you're calling into the money what do you understand now Mark that Mark that in your mind going to the marriage of the Lamb that's what this is happening here you see we're going to cover something in a minute that I want you to listen very carefully go to the number two really Joe take it for the second coming of the Lord priests 57 4 17. paragraph 87 what would think of it mister we're not only engaged but we're married now he's talking about now right the church is married to Christ we are the wife of Christ bringing forth children you can go down through there and read the rest of that that everybody wants to deal with the sloppiness of the wife and the things and all that what has happened but the main point is what he said we was already married to Christ now he just said in the quote before then we're going to the marriage motherland is that contrary or do you understand what is really being said as I said it's very odd that it says the marriage the wife that made herself ready for what the marriage of the Lamb is come now we must preach a little bit on the god to make sure that we're clear we believe in one true and living God correct amen well we believe in many manifestations of that one God so in Revelations 5 brother random will take that when Jesus raised up and that's how the Old Testament Saints winds up in chapter 5. because he said they would raise rat your message right at the end of it he said then we'd raise and we'd marched through the sky going into Rapture going up it's his words but listen it says marriage of the Lamb because there's many manifestations of God now when he was here on Earth the Bible says that he was God With Us right Emmanuel but on the River Jordan the prophet covers that he become the fullness of the godhead bodily there's no problem because the anointing came down on him amen when the River Jordan right that anointing left him in the Garden of Gethsemane and quoting wrote around anybody out on the internet wants that call me um we're looking at things that are Supernatural trying to understand them with a peanut brain see then when Jesus would hear on Earth was he God Amen amen he was born Emmanuel but he entered his ministry and when he did he began to talk about the son of man who he was he was God made flesh right you left According to Hebrew John 1 and the word about verse 14. he was made flesh and dwell a moments right all right now brother there are you trying to tell me there's a there's a bride of the father and a bride of the son and you're trying to caring now you are for thinking that but I never preached nothing like that but if the Old Testament Saints winds up to be there now the Old Testament Saints is not Peter James John and them that's right right that's right that's right they was in the Old Testament they was part of the Old Testament but they're right right now what are you going to do with the Old Testament Saints the genuine Old Testament Saints never the Old Testament Saints Donald the prophet said do you not got it I love it I thought the prophet said that that was Jehovah's bride are you listening your Prophet said those Old Testament signs was Jehovah's bride yeah that's right he put him away how far did he put him away come on they never will come back to the right School ownership or a wife right but they will be in the millennium and if Revelations at 19 is correct with the 24 Elders they must be in heaven some way they got there he said well you're you're just confusing me now I thought that the Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new yeah is that correct are we still quoting brother Brown the Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new without seek and you can you visualize in the thinking that then those Old Testament Saints when they come up there some of them people face Jesus and they look right through and they seem that the Jehovah the old was standing back good until the death Pentecost when the Holy Ghost comes that's why Peter said I would I would up I said I have a more sure word prophecy that's right you mean a more sure where Peter than to be able to see Jesus glorified he said yes right why because he had a personal experience in Jesus Christ amen inside of him right that's right so he was a Jehovah of the old and there's only one bride I'm just married to Christ Those Old Testament Saints Peter James John when they came in too by the new birth that's what I've always tried to get you to see about Daniel 7 weeks people I've never seen Gentiles that always an individual an individual an individual amen whereas Israel is a whole right right why did Peter walk out there and say I mean Jesus welcome after Peter come on Jake John Mary come on because he would prove that was going to be a gentile disregation which means Jews can come into this dispensation but when they come into this dispensation they're automatically born again right a true Jew right and us old Gentiles with clubs on her back and automatically become the children of God about a new birth but when those Old Testaments was taken saints were taken up run around and said he went straight up and said he went up and he fell down before the father and he said father it's finished I've done the work was that two Gods one sitting up here and one down here or was it manifestations of the same God right he clowned upon the throne of surround right in the end time he leaves the throne some way mysteriously and the prophet said goes behind the throne or is back there said he walks out the lamb and said he takes the book out of the handle the one sitting upon the throne and the one sitting upon the throne is the father that's right your Prophet stepped down to seven Church ages it has been Son of God Amen right the father's strong Spirit right the new birth right so we are married to him the day you receive that new birth you're married to Almighty Jehovah God you ain't made your connection with the son of man yet that's right the lamb don't come to Earth anymore he stood here right 2 000 years ago and walking short of Galilee and said I'm the son of man Son of God said he come in the baptism where the Holy Ghost is the Son of God down Through the Ages that he's sitting on the throne he said one day you become the lamb is that another God and you missed what I said while ago because he picked out some of those Old Testament Saints and he Keystone them in himself you understand what I mean he stood between the old and the new yeah he picked that people out of the Old Testament as individuals to come in he gave those individuals the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he come on over towards you and I what a wonderful thing no wonder he said to that little woman when he said to her you know she said you know give us he said it's not right for me to take the children's bread the true Jews the Israelites and give it to the dogs you've got your gentiles she said you're right Lord looks at the dogs yes the crows that fall from the Masters table amen what did he say he looked back and heard he said I haven't found a revelation in Israel like you have you reminded him that he was coming out of good gentiles because she was a gentile that's right we said I hadn't found that kind of Revelation that kind of faith in all Israel she reminded him what he come to do he gave her what she asked for didn't it his black sister Hattie Wright still that day and said there ain't nothing but the truth and God said give her what she asked for amen amen you and I get that to where we can put everything we got on this word then we can speak it too right amen believed it amen amen and then we'll get a brother saying he said brother Dale he said I've been to the Tabernacle and seen God do things but he said absolutely in God in your life and said what's the difference all right in the goddess in your life and the God that was at the Tabernacle God you know what he got what he asked for right listen Church I'm not trying to split this thing up and make half a dozen weddings I'm trying to get it all tied together where it won't be confusing see we are married and we'll read another couple quotes we're married to Christ the word all right that's right right now marrying children to her husband who is the word amen amen but we're going one day not to just a marriage sufferer to celebrate that I will be one but we're going to a marriage in the sky do you not together and when we get there he's going to be who the son of the son of God it's like I've always preached to you what is Jesus going to be when we get there he'll be almighty God there won't be a pillar of fire over here and a little Cloud floating around here and all of these things it'll be there we'll see him as he is because the Bible said we'll be like him amen we're going to be in glorified bodies with him and that's the secret that people don't know that's right I don't want a fool with yep you would have someone to ask the question was talking about that the bride would go to the marriage supper for three and a half years and they said where do we go after the end see they didn't like the seven year periods and the different things they said where do we go after then right around tells you where you go where did who isn't it Isaac where did Isaac and Rebecca go after they got married honeymoon you're not getting the story they went to the father's house right we've got something coming it folks that you don't realize what's going on but we got our own ideas and we should try to sort out things and make it here right but we're married to him the Christ but when you start dealing as the next quote does when you start dealing with son of man you're dealing with the bride being the fullness or the godhead bodily when you're dealing with with uh John what is it uh Luke no Luke 17 30. in the days when the son of man is to be revealed everybody puts that in brother Brown well I thought according to the Book of Revelations about chapter 13 12 or 13 of verse 1 I mean chapter one that the one standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick was like unto the son of man gird about the path for the golden girdle and I thought that was the feminist party man of the bride of Christ yep you see why I want to get away from preaching about what's going to happen I don't want to talk about what we are there's a lot of things going to happen but just finding about organized religion ain't gonna put us in a rapture a pope coming out of the United States ain't gonna put us in a rapture all right that's what everybody thinks this guy could be killed tomorrow to meet two out of the United States that still wouldn't put us in the rapture I thought Rapture and Faith laid in the message of the hour remember that it is but the rest is an hour said that every month by the United States praise the Lord but the Bible had spoken many times Isaiah 42 blame I believe it's 42 brainly plainly describes what John the Baptist would do when he stood on Earth right but when he stood there how many people believed right come on how many people believe me when he stood on earth and the Bible had said he would do that yeah and Jesus even referred to him right right Jesus gave him the greatest coat the compliments could ever be and acquire him to be who he was right amen and how many people believed it I mean even the disciples that had sit and listened to Jesus talk about John why did the Bible says yeah you didn't know it didn't they said oh he's not about John the Baptist they finally caught on but listen Church let's just read these few quotes because it won't be too lonely let's read sometimes we'll go ahead to number three these are taken proven his word in 1964 816 run it up to where and just get the bottom and that day sure the son of man be revealed what to join the church to the Head we're gonna have a wedding here we're already married to him as Father Strong Spirit right and we're going to get so close here until you read it that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head Dr Ashman said well we're getting married going to be the headstone to the church I said I ain't going to tell you now you have to listen this evening listen to unite the marriage you're the bride so now the marriage is being covered as the son of man and a uniting upon earth right you're going to catch on when you realize why it says and the wife the wife is the son of man on Earth in the bride so we're getting mad we've done been married about a new birth but we're in a wonderful ceremony time a wonderful uniting with the word a wonderful time with our savior and our Master but we're still going to a marriage supper and we're still going to a wedding in the sky why can't everybody get it together no understand this way what about these folks well he didn't mean that well I'm okay watch what he said the bridegroom call will come right through this right to what his message right right through the head uniting with the bride I believe the headstone to the Bride of Jesus Christ is the opening of those Seven Seals amen the message of the Prophet from 63 on going upward that's your adoption that's your all of your coverings amen all right when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh how does it run around but what about our flesh do you not the two together don't let Brian ain't talking about Mr Prophet right the church has to be the word he is the word unto you not together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman okay not one person but we're not a clergyman and I don't know you see what I mean see it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that he'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper right now we're going to do Wings amen glory watch she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage I'm going to already married your flesh self all the Flesh of the Mighty Men and all that and the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper okay now when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians your son of man the word of God and the church becomes one what so whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing right all right let's read a couple more about getting married down here and now we're covering that we're married to him by the revealed word of the new birth now we're looking at married to him for the man they have to know United with the church look at this from 1965 the invisible Union by Christ 65 11 25 paragraph 177. he says they're crying speaking and song when I think what what are you married to Joneses are you married to Christ are you married to Christ the word that's the question if we have the new birth we are married to Christ amen with the word amen all right the growth maturity if we have time that we'll read in a second will be a wonderful thing then to think about it amen look the next one which is a repeat of number one if you remember the quote after these things why I'm against organized religion 62 11 11. e paragraph 220. after these things watch is the shout of the bright Saints with the bridegroom going to the marriage of the Lamb action Revelations 19. the last call has come out of her what's going to happen go to number six take them from the 60 of 63 323. it's time for The Sixth Seal pretty soon to be opening up and when she does oh mind the end the bride has done gone forth we've left see six seal we've done left everybody understand the Queen's done wet to take her place she's being married could a king while this was going on what an Israel's room is sealed and ready to go in Nature's let's loose Oh What A Time she's been married to him well Israel's getting their message the king but I thought we'd already imagine we are looking excellent questions and answers 57 1002 program at 534 what will we do right above get all you want to the Gentile church will be taken into glory and the bride will be married to Christ He makes himself known to his people look at the next one paragraph 7 18 of questions and answers on Hebrews part 3 57 tens well six and Christ become God dwells in that person marred body completely forever into eternity when the lamb and the bride is married in heaven she walks out in full possession absolutely Isaac and Rebecca came forth in full possession and while this ceremony is going on in the heaven of the Bride the Gentile bride being married to the prince God's son in glory while they're being married that's three and a half years it takes place while the Moses and Elijah so where are we going all right Revelations 19. go ahead number nine but we're going to start just a minute and just try to pick up something but get the point if I have to cut off on this and start Wednesday he said well you sure confused me no I don't see anything confuse you I tried to prove that we're already married to Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's only the marital part of the Soul right right we're not married to him yet in body you hear somebody say I don't have no more trouble with my body then you've got somebody that's done the devil's done got them so just forget it that's right is that too hard no it's just true we're married to Christ by being married to Christ then we're going to the wedding supper and that wedding supper is going to be in the sky right all right but see we're being married now to the son of man the bride becoming the word may flesh upon Earth she's being married now right to the word This is the End Time bride this is not all of the Bride down Through the Ages all of the Bride down Through the Ages is married to Christ the word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody understand that is it married to Christ the word and will be God but there's going to be an end time group of people that hath made herself ready right right made herself ready how can you make yourself ready brother Dale I thought God made us ready I agree with you but that's the same thing we're going to read here in a second where the the armor meat packet story all you ever hear preached is that that little girl saved all of her dimes and nickels you don't hear that he sent her money you ever heard that say it oh let's just see look at the message God's keeping his word so we're going to get on the bride is made ourselves ready and he'll use right like I told you there's only one actual quote where that wrote around uses a wife that's my intercept ready and I'll I'll give it to you because I don't have it on the plane it's in the Revelation chapter four uh part 1 16-12 31. he's talking about Revelation 19 Begins the seventh verse this is when the church appears again never appeared again until over in the 19th Chapter and he reads the scripture let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb that's come and his wife has made herself ready and I could preach on that till midnight and not have television look his wife has made herself ready that's the only quote that didn't find it he said have or has but he'll use Brides to watch from the message God keeping his word 57. I got 77. but God was determined God was determined that his word would not return to him he was going to keep his word he has to keep his word and he must do it in order to be God if he has to make it make a change of anything and by the grace he will do it that's the reason I say if the church does not get herself ready that's your duty right to get ready I got the Holy Ghost amen what kind of a wife are you you got the Holy Ghost makes you alive what kind of a wife are you well it don't make no difference what I do I'm ready to go well you know what that means we don't go you might have the paperwork but what's your wife doing well that'd be something to come home there's a lot of in there and run around my brain where he said wouldn't it be something to come home to your wife cheat out flirting around a bunch of men I don't live with them while you're going to work would that be a good wife you know she got the paper said she just wanted but the Bible says she's dead while she's living am I right had to make a change if your church does not get herself ready that's your duty to get ready the bride has made herself ready the Garment is packed garments is paid for they are ready but you must be ready to wire those garments the church has made herself ready you've got to be ready look at your next one let's read facts this is God's provided way 59 paragraph Eve 54. you remember the Bible said in the bride has made herself ready and the road to the righteousness of the Saints you see so that little girl only got 25 cents a week armor meat packing situation right the guy comes out to get it and that's the background oh but oh how happy she was that year just washing and singing and saving every penny she could rest of them went to town and bought them packs of cigarettes and want more you know and they're whiskey and carry on new decks of cards and had their big time but she just labored away why she was getting ready making herself ready you remember in the Book of Ruth Ruth ladybird sure until she got the six measures a meal right and then she rested right amen and then finally first thing you know she got to town she got the wedding garment and got the money that he sent her how are you reading it and got the money he sent her now see it's not her doing everything but it's not him doing everything right he's giving us the garments but we got to put him on he gave us eternal life remember I said he gave us the gifts he gave us some things but we got to put them on what I said a while ago trying to explain it salvation is of the Lord Jonah 209 I believe that's right you don't have anything to do with the Salvation you receive with Jesus Christ except the fact you accept it amen the rest of it is a free gift but from then on you better start doing some working like Ruth you better start laboring you better start studying and praying yeah right right that's all I've encourage people to do you know if you study and pray you don't have to worry about somebody deceiving you you can say Hey brother that ain't right but look the money he sent her and got the wedding garment and come back to all she had put with all he gave her she come back ready to get married she made herself ready go ahead in the next one the marriage or the excuse me of the Lamb preaching 62 121 the evening paragraph 53. and we know that there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in disguise that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready I love that quote so we don't need another Prophet we don't need somebody to tell us where the Prophet was wrong is that what he said yes right the material is on earth now if you notice she has made herself already so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me now once you illustrating she's made herself ready if the Lord will take this and he's ever said that this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you you got to do something to they had overcome children heard all things made it overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready I'll take that word you see God could not push you push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then saying blessed in he that overcome it that's right I thought God done everything he put us any pool tonight he said we couldn't say we're Overcomer these Church Angels do the overcoming right in the back of church they had nothing to overcome he just pushed us through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself I'm doing that we show our funny and respect to God you get it yes man he said that's up to you got a couple more that's all right I'll paraphrase it is he said the hour has come the bride is made herself ready oh my made herself ready she laid aside all of the things remember Esther was chosen and the others were rejected no one was Esther Jones the brightest that made herself ready we got the potential the holy spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick all of these things right in his his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age no way through right that's on the message birth pains started out 196. how did she make herself ready to becoming his wife and what does she what kind of a garment has she got on his own words right amen think about it please expecting us to put this word on this garment amen the righteousness of the Saints but I want to State it one more time then we're married to Christ by the new bird amen right and we're going to the marriage supper there will be one all right but now we are being united to the word of the hour this end time people not down to the ages the end time people a day without us cannot be made perfect that's that's the dependability upon you and I for that part and we're going to the marriage of the Lamb that says he said it is come it's there we're going to the marriage now think about it when we go out here in a rapture Israel is going to strike a tribulation period now for three and a half years while we are at the prophet ship marriage supper you know what that means that means we got married somewhere that's not the marriage of the Lamb the marriage of the Lamb is a revealed word our son of man you couldn't do that until the end time so there's only the end time bride is dealing with the son of man they never dealt with it down to the ages none of the writers even in the scripture spoke with the son of man that's right I ain't talking about Matthew Mark Luke and John in the recording that was what Jesus said no writings of Paul Peter Etc mentioned son of man right John goes over to Patmos and come back to the one like unto the son of man the church we got a wedding to go to amen and then we got a marriage supper after the wedding so we're going to get married when we meet him in the sky that's right just as Isaac and Rebecca got married and then it went to the father's house and they had a wedding supper it was a beautiful thing right around said there'll be a table foreign thousands of miles long listen to me he said we'll be standing at that table he said we'll look across that table and we'll see those brothers and sisters that made it and say there is Mark Richard Marlo now you say there ain't gonna be no crying in heaven that's right you better change your mind because I can quote real good the prophet said there'll be tears running down her cheek said he will come and walk away the tears from her eyes and say Well done done no good and faithful sir now enter into the things that have been prepared for you from the foundation of the world that's right and there's going to be a marriage in this Heaven amen that's right you see one when they would preach it and say we're getting we're married now they ain't gonna be marriage and no marriage in heaven that didn't ring with me real good I just I can't explain it so I in a better way against but see now I can see there's going to be a marriage in the sky when we meet him in the air is going to be a marriage and he's going to take us to the marriage supper and we're going to have a wonderful time and there's going to be a little period of time there's kind of blanks out there because Israel is going to precede us into the Millennium and build a millennium Temple that's where most people don't even believe that that's what your Prophet said he said to Ezekiel 40 to 44 was the Millennium temple being erected on Earth and you know what then after a while we come riding we'll get to that Wednesday Lord with us we come riding back with him come on musician into the Millennium that's right a wonderful story truly then we will be the bride the wife that has made herself ready bro that's why when John gets on over we'll get back to it later when he gets on over to make sure that you don't have no loophole John gets over and and the angel says to John said come and I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife that don't leave nobody out Don't Leave Nobody out that's right the bride is all down to the ages the laugh is the maturity of the of the end time bride nobody's left out I've had a wonderful thing what do we got What a Mighty Godly sir all right what a mighty God you know I know dark more remark how you say the word uh you see if there's any trouble the way things are showing up it looks like cancer Gray Brothers anybody help me Living Word great we've all been together Ray Every time to the right place I love you anymore foreign I imagine foreign Disney Infinity
