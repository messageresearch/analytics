TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now what we're going to do is we're going to go back over the quotes or gene asked my time not here ok I'll have them call me myself already all right good thing tail all right now where we finished that last Sunday was because they want to try to not finish today but get close to finishing and then we're going to go on to the Seventh Seal that's all right they'll take 1 through 13 7 so but I want to try to either this this only a next time to clear everything up show you all the quotes and then kind of I think the dates and all we're pretty familiar and everything okay with the dates we've nailed them down pretty good but when now we got to look at these clothes now once you remember one thing watch what brother Graham saying in here watch what brother random was saying here he is going through the 70th week of Daniel the 70th week I think he's going through these deputy you will right now that I all right but I wants to watch because when we go into the seal quotes what's what he says this is where people are so confused because they say brother branham was confused or he was wrong because what we definitely see in this 6-foot purpose quote and in the one that we're fixing to read more brother Brown said this is what the Holy Spirit cut all night the end right now as the Holy Spirit confuse brother Ralph not confused either but I want you to watch how this transpires because remember last Sunday we showed back over here right here this first quote we're going to read one more time to be third Sunday a watch this is 1957 it was the question magic 20 usually take another picture damn stood back over the old property said there would be 70 or weeds yet loaded to the Jew and the Messiah would come to France and will prophesied a mess of the 70th weeks which was the seven years he's talking about the seven-year Ministry of Jesus Christ he's reducing the whole seventy weeks of Daniel into one week okay which is the three and a half year Ministry of Jesus here or back in a t30 and two three and a half years Ministry of Jesus Christ here that's why we show that chart that Bob had done before you bring that it's not an extra week but it's committed it really shows what brother was talking about because he reduces that down to that Mossad watch how many times he says my side but he does not say that that much in gables instruction see full purpose he's talking about that 70th week this whole week all right cuz look the Mossad there is no scripture I want somebody to bring scripture to me to show me that Messiah was to come and in the middle of the week be cut off there's no scripture for that 0 Daniel 9 says after sixty two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself right and then he verse 27 shall make a covenant with many for one week that's not Jesus because that person breaks the Covenant and we saw all in here that we know it's the Antichrist ok so what prophesied the midst of the 70th which which was the seven years he'd be cut off in the myth what in the midst of that Mossad manosphere let son of man ministry he would be cut off but promise to come back to the Jews through two prophets and gather 140 1000 everybody got that right because he look there's three and a half years yet lauded to them to the Jews it's got kebaya all right Jesus was exactly pretty straight half years and was crucified right he's not talking about this week he was crucified by Kobe under right fist fighting back homie under please not on my this week he's talking about the Messiah ministry the ministry of jesus christ because it's going to be important when we keep going watching because she sings for purpose so the israel dinner on to god and in this 70th week what's going to happen name's not all about Masada all right 6mo purpose and the 70th year of Daniels 70th week rather telling to make the hint of sin keeps going alright what is the end time the end of the seven when that press ENTER cross will be revealed at this time making himself good right in midweek watch in the middle of this 70th week it'll break his covenant with Rome aroma break-ins come with Israel now he's talking about this week I have got the one according to the Bible there's one week left I'm carafe to the church alright so bro am calm break scripture from 100,000 time he can't make it say something they're gonna say all right he's talking about this right here he's giving us a commentary of this whole week because remember we're not even here so this is not to us but to finish that 70th week of Daniel you got to have all these things brought in okay now keep going 6mo purpose again let's go purpose they're what now I just caught it now it's fresh they are now nation recognizes that right programs they limit but they have not yet their temple worship and what am I going to get their temple worship and when they establish the temple worship the church will be gone that's the bride God will be dealing with the Jews as a nation and when they are brought into this Confederation Rome will break it in the middle of this 70th year nice so much this week right here got it watch continue on so much the seven if we'd now he's into the 70th week of Daniel he's talking about this all this stuff and then gets planted right 144,000 don't appear there that bearing on the third chapter that's us like a third remember we go up in Revelations for one we'll get into that in the seal so that's important we see all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week the last week you saw about this week right now they've already had 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way God said they would you don't seem very confused of it alright and lived it exactly the way that God said they would it happened exactly the way God said it would then there's one more week promise to the Jew now you can't say anything different than that right or he's lying right you can't say hey different that or he's telling life alright so now there's one more week promise with the dude now brother to get ready listen how close we are all right now here we got in the 17th week here we go again now watching he's talking he's telling exactly and there you are where we add right here where's it the Maasai get cut off exactly where the word said wherever that 70th week began not the Messiah we the seven if we could finish the seventy weeks of Daniel exactly after this church is cut off right want to clap after the rapture all right now got that keep going we're gonna read one in just a minute in the midst of the 70th week he breaks the Antichrist branch his covenant with the Jews got it after the kiprotich rough time he breaks it in the middle of the week all right now how about the two prophets they'll be killed our God is a terrible God when his anger but remember that's over in the 70th week and the churches in glory the waiting supper is going on now that's where we seen her coming back to the Millennial temple over here at the end of the Jewish days the anointed everybody got that all right all right the 70th week this golden eagle the little highlight the seventh week this goes on during the 70th week in the middle of it he brings hit because he killed those two Pentecostal preacher now that pretty that's pretty uh you know he's he says it's seven or eight times so he's not just staying at one time and then maybe made a mistake as they say in the message night the moment he started at 70th week or seven years the church is gone how many times he said that before time all right church is gone can you see it friends raise up your hand let's not be cheer children let's not be playful anymore we're at the end time look at 191 though 69 weeks hit perfect buffet 69 hit perfect that's already been fulfilled how much more to left one week our seven-year 69 weeks are finished those 69 weeks hit perfect the gone way of the dudes hit perfect the church age hit perfect red hand down and to the left in church a aren't know what right here this is one they don't like the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone how many time he said it this is what they Elijah now listen I'm quoting again re quoting so you won't forget and if you've got your book they actually highlighted it in the book in the Old look now if we did a new book then the old book gets paragraph 192 of the feminine week and he says this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my pen while I was writing that's the first out and argue with them they are you with that or the Holy Spirit's wrong one of those it and I don't see that he gets the wrong interpretation because this is what the Holy pit put on my pendrive all right so now whatever quotes we're fixing to see can't be contrary to that because the contention in the message is is that brother branham preach this whole three sermons and what's wrong and then God straighten him out in the seals that there's only three and a half years left to finish Daniel 72 week that's not true he can't break the Bible the Bible says is one winglet okay so you see that this is what those better put it on my pen while is right they may I ask you a question by go to that book show that quote alright so something must be happening though let's continue on with this one this is where I will preach the other night the 70th Jubilee making it 3430 years all right and then he keeps on with 77 will be the seventh if you believe since the beginning of you believe all right all right we're at the end time this is close to the end of the message and we're here at the end of the age at the coming in of the 70th week tell me quick now i watch he has not said one thing about my side right he's given you a chronology a chronological order of church goes one will the church be gone right here Wimbledon if anything we begin after that the Pope is going to come and break the Covenant he's not saying anything about on my side remember that because this is what's going to happen at what then go back revelations 11 who you come about these two prophets how many is it uh-huh thousand two hundred three score day 169 three half years and when they shall be killed in the street right in the midst of this 70th we put it perfect right all right all right mmm now then i watch how sure he wants to ask them how many seas Daniels 70th week now see what the 70th week is still haven't said anything about my side hi all right now let's go to the next he breaches this in 1961 doesn't say another word about the 70th week of Daniel until nineteen sixty three is the evening messenger all right I got that notice that the journey to tolerance has to be taken away first of the Jews the end of the seventy weeks of Daniel takes place the three and a half years Mossad prophesied days bringing in Messiah and then he was cut off the Pratt's in the middle of the 70th week now that sounds like that he's cutting Jesus off right here in the middle of this everything we are as they say in the message he was the three and a half years did he preached was the first half of the 70th week it is according to that Messiah week that that ball had on the chart they're back out there he's talking about my side now he's not talking about events this is events and this is according to the Bible and this is what the Holy Spirit foot on his pen to write he can't change it to what's he talking about he's talking about back over in that quote before 1957 of bringing everything to seven years three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here so when does Jesus prophesied in the last half of that 70th week that he's talking about are the last seven years the seven years of Jesus's ministry not the order in here all right that's when they get mixed up see then there's three and a half weeks left yet there is right there's not seven more years of Jesus's ministry level the only one week they'd only at three and half years of Jesus's ministry left he preached three and half over there pre-screen half here never got that he's bringing in my side watch how many times he says my side because one more time so my find me in the bout will work a Bible says that my side of the antigen we've got off in the midst of the week it's not in the Bible oh my god at them just real quick but I mean it makes perfect sense because we had Jesus as a ministry through the Holy Spirit to the seven churches in the juice get it through 720 them so journey oh absolutely i mean we get look let me interject something cuz we're going to get into it in the seal of maybe 6-8 months from now the first time jesus preached no one understood that three and a half years no 100 student until the Holy Ghost fell and then Paul and Peter them picked it up by the Holy Spirit got the revelation of the Son of God we preached it before remember the Son of Man revelation that had been had been taken up the headstone to be rejected but he is to come back in the end time to do what now in the end time we get the full seven-course meal because we understand what's going to happen here plus we understand what Jesus did back there so we get that last seven years of Messiah ministry the Son of Man ministry we get it in the end time the full revelation of in other words the revelation to deter cages they got apart but we get a full revelation all right now if I got that what he brings him aside he was cut off the cramps in the middle seventies week he's caught up in the midst of that seven-year period of Jesus is preaching there right but you can't make him say anything else know what they're going to ask him a question in the seals and it's exactly what we just read and programs anointed Senate now there's a problem somewhere and he never said I was wrong I'm changing it he'll say you didn't get what I said because what what's the most important thing about the whole thing that name you leave that seven-year Ministry of Jesus Christ three and a half years to begin with and this grant half right here that's going to redeem listen look that's going to redeem a hundred percent of Christian Kingdom I said Christian born-again spirit filled people that's a hundred percent of what's going to be in that sixth dimension it's already in there now what's deeds and we're coming back to rule and reign for a thousand years so that is the most important these dates and time thing you know like I said it's not a Salvation issue but it is an issue that if somebody comes up to you and said when I brother Adam was wrong and damaged during the week well if he was wrong in one place that's what brother said he left the message he said brother Brown said if I was wrong in one place he said I'm wrong everywhere one word off got us out the garden one word so you think that three sermons and then changing it back and forth see what that does it puts a question brother Brown said marriage and divorce he preached it because they quit of a question and people's mind what was the question misinterpreted theology that they had preached down to the church ages that it was alright married and horse marry and divorce men divorce right Moses give us a ride to divorce when he said yeah but from the beginning I wasn't them Jesus told them that so brother branham bracelet back there from the beginning it wasn't so one man one life so watch this now watch here we go come up to the fix to the fifth seal I know watching the town of Daniel now the second half at the 70th week massage he starts bringing in the Messiah how long did Christ preached on my preaching now he's now talking about a chronological event of order in this last week he's talking about Jesus preaching a message all right but there's determined yet to the people remember you got a weaning talk about the only city it is only three and a half years to get the people ready but to get that city and all this done over here you've got to have more time and then we proved by the Bible that we got you 30 more days and forty five more days lap it over into the millennium all right the buddy all right with that all right let's read this one but now when it comes to dealing with his room in this last part of the 70th week and not hear the last part of this Mossad wait what he deals with them as a nation he who Oh God Jesus the Messiah all right okay God will completely turn from the Gentile okay got that yes please talking about Amazon message a ministry he wasn't in the 70th week of Daniel he didn't say much about the message only that there's three and a half years left of the message to the Jews all right and my witness some of y'all staring off into space all right cuz we got to deal with this because this is the contentions of people in the message he was wrong over here but he was right here but he's never even in this whole messy to look at it in the sealed he never said I was wrong he never said tariffs that chart he never said I was wrong in it but now he did when he was none like a white horse rider he said God corrected me and I come to tell you now what a man would be God corrected him and he would take being that he preach preach sermons not just one little sermon on a shed somewhere he preached three sermons on the end said the Holy Spirit put that only intend to write that there was one we left Africa after that's why I said according to the Bible in the province message but now there's only three and a half years of Messiah message left son man ministry there's only three and a half years letting not settle all right last strand half years of Daniel 70 we promise to the juice is people remember now they have to prove that this is Daniel's last part of the seven eight week what you've got a question on that watch 70 weeks was promised which was seven years he brands every bit of that stem two weeks of Daniel 27 years the one that Bob showed on the chart that yell at the top if you'll see it it says three and a half over here the Jesus preached in pre and half he's got free from here include property right which was seven years in the mix to the seven weeks to Messiah was to be taught to make sacrifice from South Korean having that what he told her mesial ministry the ministry of jesus christ he preached green hat cough in the middle of that part which was seven years let me see what I'm talking about he condensed every bit of that down and many many times and I don't have time to read him you were reading I told you to read the book he says which is seven years he breaks all the seventy weeks of Daniel down to seven years 13 a half years of ministry over there three and a half years of ministry here and he wants to cut off in the midst of that week but there's no scripture for that right now 70 wheezes problem which was seven years in the midst of the seven weeks on the side be cut off to be made sacrifices he would prophesize three and a half years and then he would be cut off for a sacrifice for the people and there is still a determined three and a half years is still determined for Israel then when Messiah was cut off the Jews blinded look how many times he said my side my side my side he's talking about Jesus he's not talking about this seventy weeks of Daniel in a chronological order he's talking about now if not he said well that's just your opinion well the holy spirit was wrong then in the seventy weeks of Daniel book The Holy Spirit was wrong and now the Holy Spirit change his mind if that's what we're talking about the same week we're not talking about the same way all right here we are on a sixth seal this was my point the other day to do some of the preacher now we're in a sick sealed God has opened five seals he's in number six and he's not said one thing about I was wrong okay because what is the seals the seals are Redemption the seals are not dates and than putting this here and putting that left it's the redemption of us and two people Jewish people because these two prophets opened the sixth seal right here on earth remember revelations for 12 19 that's not to us well whenever where does the seal start revelation 6 1 but we get all the spiritual aspect of it the seals has to open to us before they'll open to the youth right all right okay so you see every time he's saying this last part of the 70th week he's not coming up this week he's going at the last part of the Messiah seven-year message of Jesus Christ everybody got that if not I won't say one more time if not then let's just be like the rest of the people in Saturday life are that he didn't know what he's talking about and got straightened him out remember go back to the quote the Holy Spirit put that only spend writing so listen that wasn't that book that dance in a week book was not in man's opinion that was God telling us something I said I onion field where you gotta keep peeling the onion back to get the real revelation because you can't make brother Brown say two different things and in him continue on in the greatest opening of the word that he's ever been in he was always already up to the six deal there would have been me if I would have been wrong and had been just you know so they did in all the other all the rest i remember the fifth seal Jew he said I was wrong he said I thought that was just sold on the offer crying how long he said that the fifth field you God was revealing it to him but he would come in and tell us he never said a word about home we're gonna get to that quote demented that's when they're supposed to be delivered what this life's ministry the last green hat here in Jesus's minute all right then he continued on one solar house how long is Daniel's having to wait last part of the 70 weeks 39 years so there's only three and a half years left of Jesus's ministry after we go after the rapture right all right now let's go to questions and answer I think 63 this is questions on the seals we want to kona Daniel 9.7 confirmed for a week now watch he he goes right over Daniel 9 27 does not have any plan to do with Jesus right but now rather random what about this that's what the Holy Spirit on my pen to write but what about the standard 927 no watch he goes right to Jesus Christ what happened was confirmed the Covenant when Jesus Christ on earth preaching to the Jews he never went to the Gentiles at all the codes and ciphers going Billy Gentile devil to the Jews alone now remember they they cut him off let his blood be on us when our children any priest for three and a half years here he watch talk preach Jesus Christ now down to 927 any way you interpret Daniel 9 27 they don't talk about preaching and it will talk about Jews Oh Dana 927 said he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the myth of the week you will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease I'm about putting it verbatim there's nothing in there about a message preached by the light so he must not be talking about that leak but I'm like what mom and bro Dale's always contended brother branham is picking up their thought their thought being that there's seven more years left of Jesus's ministry because watch i'ma tell you that's half of the 70 week now daniel said he would do they bring that's great know what let's go to this let's go right down to this one that everybody goes to this one right here you have brandy Anthony NAB was looking at some let's say go back I had but me and Papa will get up something this morning I'll find it in my archives here and get minute well he didn't say that I don't think he said there's one I had it ahead of time like I said we got into combat 8030 and I find them in about 15 you find it Bree says its own questions and answers just like 1964 right here here it is again I want to be like here's a question all right brother ground hope they might see this so this is the biggest one that all the preachers of the message use excuse me brother branham when you get a message on the 70 church week seventy weeks part of em Daniel I believe you mentioned that the phone last week or last seven years will begin when a bride was taking interaction how many times these want to ask you a question how many times did we just read reset win will that 70 we begin when the bride or the church is gone right that's right now watch he says no no no no good I name now he didn't say I got that wrong he said you got that wrong okay because the thought of this brother must have been was that they were seven years of Jesus's ministry level because watch he goes right straight again not to these events but not the full seven weeks now he just said seven times there was one week left after the rapture and that's what the Holy Spirit always pinned all right we must contend that that stays the same and that he's talking about something else now watch the week started when Jesus came on earth he never said that days anyway this week starts after the church is gone but the Messiah ministry started when Jesus came on earth the massage here he goes print show coming prophesied to the seven weeks he'll be cut off there's no scripture for that and Jesus preach know what goes to preaching Jesus preached exactly doing a half years which is half of the 70 weeks or seven days or seven week we'd dates he's talking he's going through a pretty bad and there's 39 years left all right to me it's very simple he's not talking about this week at all except the last half of that week see look you got that wrong he didn't say I was wrong and now I'm correcting it that would be the very time if the Holy Spirit was present during this time that's what what people the message thinking I'm the Holy Spirit boy you spoke about through brother vinyl but what about this what about the letter said to like wow he was probably wrong there no one man said that's what the Lord told him to write okay he shall come in from the side of the midst of the seven weeks he'll be cut off Jesus preach exactly three and a half years know why don't you watch this he goes on in go straight now this brother could this is a continuation of that question six then it seems like the first ran out years was fulfilled during the ministry ministry well here you've got it right here about Ministry of Jesus but the expression midst of the week seems to be applied only to the ant across breaking its covenant with know that enter Christ breaks is coming it at the end of the last three and a half years what the last three and a half years of Jesus man replace the midst of this 70th week so I got that bro all right as I understood Daniel tape the first 69 weeks ended when Jesus runner Jerusalem 8030 that's exactly what brother Brown said so he can if he tells him something different it's wrong so that the three and a half years of his ministry will be included in the stick to nine weeks and the bull last week or seven years would still be fulfilled and would begin at the Raptor now many times he said that the last week would happen after the right to the church no up you know brother sister everybody is asked question very fine but I believe you've got a little mixed up on what I said let's go back over here and take this book and read seven times just one week left out of the raft of the church seven time and then let's see how that fits with it Jesus came into Jerusalem that is exactly right that was and oh he went right straight in from there was crucified and he did promise I half of the seventy weeds which history and a half remember he condensed the whole seventy weeks of Daniel to one week Jesus preached three and a half years was cut off now he's got three and a half years more ministry left but that has nothing to do with the Bible he can't change brother I'm contains about okay Daniel 9 27 is the Antichrist it's not Jesus cry okay right because whether up listen even better and will tell you God doesn't ever break the Covenant man breaks coming no I never write to cover because if he shall prophesied heat and I'm sorry he shall confirm the couple minute for one week and then the midst of the week he'll know words you have caused sacrifice no places he's knowing him he'll do away with that treaty as that Jesus know not what what I look he did prophesied half of the 70 weeks prophesied days right to Jesus he's not own dates and times and bringing in the city he's talking about the Ministry of Jesus Christ during this time was to getting up the saints for the rapture church they continued on okay everybody got there yeah so the Messiah could leave if you pluck off the Gentiles and you put that together that's the one weakness I that's great and that's the reed moment the reason it is one week is because they cut him off in the first place if they would have accepted that first three and a half they to never been to see they broke they would be scripture God knew what they were doing I knew what they were doing at swank and ride because if they would have accepted the first three and a half years they never been another Korean happy they'd be no 70 weeks today milady been don't see one come up the predestination of God he knew what will it work so he brought it back and said hey I know they're going to cut this off they're gonna cut me off I know that because he had his eyes on that Gentile bride right right but that we also overlaps the 70th that's correct right here it overlaps right here we'll pull that chart up just a second let me read one more quote hey why you going back to what you were just reading there an answer when brother branham speaking the question is first read he serves talked about for seven years and they and then he says that you got it wrong me to go and the first thing does first singing engines is Jesus the Messiah right preaching right for that crown then right after that the sequim quote that he comes to the first thing he says is no Moses and Elijah right so it starts right thing because he's free so when he's speaking of it seven here's the first thing he's talking about his Jesus ministry the second thing he brings up yes he brings up Moses and Elijah and he says they they prophet saw 1200 and he says 64 days video I talked about the other through i have heerd rock layer and then he continues on and he's speaking and if i was a question product about cutting the mix in the midst of the lead back to my dad tries to know that but he's running on what he's talking about that seven here's he covers both house right together right now same thing here and i love community now in the last part this isn't questions and answers again 1963 down the last part the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of the tribulation period after the rapture of the church then there's three and a half years here that it will be confirmed to them again by prophets he goes right through like like Aaron said he always goes to Jesus and Moses and Elijah so that's the seven-year ministry that he's talking about Jesus Christ the Messiah son of man ministry alright so now just to put a little clarity on that and we'll we'll finish right here unless somebody's got anything else don't watch Jim get kissed by what is the charge how are you told me to delete it I deleted them all right let's say Bob and charge Bob and chart Bob and chart harbor freight all right don't you move it does car rental do thank you all right here we go dance chart yeah they're so in the parking lot you see that huge parking lot sale place us a huge party line real quick this might take a second to load up something does much so many wonderful things on it how long would be before we get that charge you know Bob we have a few things to readjust well hey listen if I want to put a charge less like that sermon last couple waves years ago don't put it out I want to make sure that everything's covered so I will I don't want somebody feel you know what they gonna pick it apart though over this your hair you about that all right here we go pieces of it because really he had right down here he had that Jubilee sounded in the Sabbath months of the 49th year he'd known it sounds in the 50 here or the first year of the next cycle if I got that no Logan I guess huh what does have three forty dollars in a row in 72 sure that is 49 in the 49 year cycle the cycle of it you let our English cheer to the honey nut all right right here right there is exactly why brother Brown was talking about the three and a half year gives his ministry here and a three and a half years use of ministry here not speaking of this whole 70th week because that's according to the Bible you can't break that that's according to the Bible alright Daniel 9 27 is when he breaks the Covenant I told him you going to move them bombs over there a little bit but here's your statesville purpose to me the six whole purpose again before we get when we finish this read your six volt purpose there is no way you can bring in our lasting right to seal up vision and prophecy and North the most holy which is us entering into the Millennial temple and then the valve Armageddon starts and destroys all of it and then we got to go do it again but this is exactly perfect my love i'm on the prophets message if you'll pay attention to what he said it okay Jesus was cut off in the midst of that Messiah Jesus's ministry not the same between that's the one week of Jesus's ministry because everything can be wrapped up into what he preached here and what he's going to preach to the Jews here everything everything hinges on us getting the revelation of this message of Jesus Christ and them getting the revelation them to use the people getting a revelation of Jesus Christ through to profits for that last half of that part of the 70th week that brother is
