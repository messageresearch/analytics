want to speak in Jesus name we pray amen Zechariah Chapter 4 this is going to be a little little bit different uh we're going to speak we're we're um downstairs we're in the Sunday school class we're going through the seals but we're going to we started in the breach about a month ago and I believe the breach was put where it was put for a foundation so we're going to speak on the breach a foundation now we know God in Simplicity was the first message God is getting the people to realize something something the greatest week known to man since Jesus Christ was buried or or killed and buried and rose again was a greatest week week when that Prophet broke those SEALS or actually when the lamb came down and broke the seals and delivered them to his people so let's read Zechariah 4 verse 6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel zerubabel means a prince With God all right saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts so it's not a man's spirit it's the holy spirit amen spirit of God who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundations of this house now remember zerubabel was a person he was a captain he came in and actually laid the foundation for the temple so this is not some fictitious character it's a character in the Old Testament that was real and he came and he built that Foundation but listen the hands of jeral have laid the foundation of this house right makes it personal his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you amen for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet now plummet is used by Carpenters it's lead fastened to a line to do what make something straight all right so now what is the prophet doing in the breach he's laying something straight for us all right you got to have a foundation before you can build and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubba with those seven in other words he had to come back and line everything up with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the the word if you would turn to Revelations chap 5 CU that's where we're going to be speaking from tonight so here we've got zerubabel building a house now anybody knows that human beings have to be led Christians have to be led because we are sheep all right but as being human beings God knows how we think because he was once a human being walking on the Earth himself and actually he is the one that wrote this so he knew it before the foundation of the world how it was going to happen he just came down and made it happen all right so in Revelations chap 5 we're going to see that I looked up the word breach the word breach has a has a meaning that maybe not so much as what we would think because we always say Well it it it's a it's the gap between you know the the church ages and and the seals there was a gap in there you know but U excuse me the Hebrew lexican the word breach means bursting forth Outburst right break open break through burst forth you've heard of the word called a breach of security what does that mean someone has broke something open an Open Door there was something sealed cuz when you when something's secure it's sealed up right right there was a breach of security somebody broke that seal and broke into something all right now the prophet of God was not a thief he wasn't breaking in to steal something he was breaking in to give us a revelation Glory all right so now in Revelations five to begin the seals you're not going to just start like we would normally think would be start with seal number one SE number two brother Rand preached God and implicity I'm laying a background here because you and I are humans we do things one two three you say no yes you do everybody knows today the first thing you're going to do in the morning you're going to get up and turn the alarm clock off you're going to go in the bathroom get all your stuff ready and go to work some of you that are Reet retired um don't have to do that right praise the Lord dick brother dick was shaking his head but the first thing you do you know what you're going to do there's a ritual you get up every morning do the same thing we're creatures of what habit all right so in being creatures of habit let's apply that to what brother Brandon was talking about in the seals because we realized this was not a man doing this this was God bringing this to us all right he had to bring it through a man zerubabel had to build a house but it was God working through that man to build a house all right so now he's starting with God in Simplicity showing that it's going to be simple but when he comes to the breach he's laying a foundation because he's coming out he preached the church ages and he saw that the church ages had ended in in in his Revelation he saw that now we're still living in the seven Church ages right so don't get me wrong don't get me in some doctrine that we're already passed that and in the Millennium no we are physically in the seventh Church Church age right we act like lay out of we drove a lay out of car right we got a new layot ofing honey well um thingy over there on the wall I don't see no wires cut off of it so when it's hot we're going to cool it down when it's cold we're going to warm it up so we're all still in the leosan age and we still have leosan habits all right but the Bri is called out of that age all right so here brother brandham is starting and he's bringing up to a point what God is wanting to lay a foundation so that he can break that first seal yeah right if not he wouldn't all right so in Revelations chap 5 we see that God has done something but now watch what God done to a prophet to start this thing and it's very simple but I'm going to read out of out of the seal book on page 60 out of this this book which I'm going to give you the paragraph number and since we're doing this downstairs we're just kind of going to run right along with it because I believe it's helpful and I believe it's something that if that was a foundation for us to work off of then the foundation never goes away right you still build on that same Foundation brother Brandman number in page 60 which is the breach but it's we're going to I'm going to quote the paragraph numbers in case somebody wants to follow with me the paragraph numbers are always the same uh in the old books they they vary by Pages all right but in the uh breach paragraph 11 now watch what God's doing God is showing a prophet something I want to just get this out of the way because you and I must have an experience with God but these seals can open to us there's a foundation that's got to be laid right that we got to not jump above that Foundation right we got to start on that foundation and we got to make sure that Foundation is solid right that it's not a foundation that'll go away not built on shifting sand ver in number 11 now here's a prophet he this is what he's saying before he begins to preach the breach he says I was standing there in prayer and something happened now something fell in my hand and I know if you don't understand spiritual things it may seem very strange but Str something struck my hand and when I looked it was a sword now everybody remembers we went through the story but now remember you going down a little bit further he's describing the sword but here is the key not even that it was just the king sword but he said it just fit my hand amen exactly right it was just like it was already his right like he'd already used it before cuz he said it fit my hand exactly then he said well I wonder and said it meant this is the king sword this is paragraph 13 and said I a king sword and it might have been that I would have understood it but it said the king sword so in other words he's talking about the word but look he goes on remember that's the he's getting the people to try to realize something during the whole week not look to him right but look to God because God was on the scene doing something amen he wanted them to see God was doing something through him and it's not just an experience that he is supposed to take because I'll read you something here in just a second in verse 14 he's talking about then taking that sword and dueling with someone see he goes on a little further it's not just the sword came in his hand and all that fit my hand exactly right he went on to the F on more of the foundation right he said in dueling you see I don't understand the word but one principle of dueling the rest of my understanding the knife striking across and then finally the sword if they lock the enemy and you lock swords like this so it's in other words just like this right all right then it takes the strength of the man dueling see how he going further he's not just talking about oh it' be wonderful just to have a sword no no no he's going further right then it takes the strength of the man dueling because see his sword will be pointed to my heart and mine would be pointed to his that's when they go forward if you ever watch fencing they do the same thing they they lock their their swords together and they're really close to each other's heart but they're locked as our knives strike each other and then they strike and then the swords come together and the one that can shove the other one down the sword is straight to the heart so it takes here's paragraph 15 even though the sword be the word right it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy amen all right now and that's what he's explaining now and he goes on and says he does not know what the first seal second and third but you see how God was bringing the people up not to look at him which they did but not to look at him but to see that that he was identifying that the word was a part of his life that he was a part of the word and that God was trying to get that out to the people right all right because remember he preached the church ages and now he's preaching the breach so keep that in mind all right let's go to 64 page 64 but I'll get to the paragraph Just a second Now watch how God is hiding in Simplicity but watch what the prophet says now he's he's speaking of Revelations 10 cuz he's talking about the book he's talking about the book now all right now paragraph 37 now see the mystery of this seven seal book will be revealed at the sounding of of the seventh Church Angel's message see the seventh angel begins to sound and there is the message wrote out here and we got it in tape and book form and he just continues right on with his sermon and never never you hear him on the tape he never even pauses he just continues right on with his thought at the beginning of the sound of the mystery said now we notice the book of mystery of God is Not revealed into the sth Angels message sounded he told him exactly where it was right right did you hear what I said he said there's the Mage wrote out there and we got it in tape and book form God was clearing the foundation off just a little bit more Amen to bring a message through this little man the message of what Redemption all right remember I hope they fix that thing over there I know the on and off button I promise you that Aaron don't have to be here Richard either one cut that cord but listen just for a second just kind of get you I know a lot of you are Fanning but listen to the prophet and we're going to start right here actually we're going to back up to chapter 4 but listen in the breach 1963 317 now now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the Seven Seals it is the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals now what is a breach a breach is breaking open breaking forth all right now there is also a sixth chapter uh there was a fourth chapter rather of Revelations and it in that it kind of re reveals something that would take place after the church going up that's Revelations 4 that the church goes up on the third chapter of Revelations and does not return until the 19th Chapter therefore the church misses the tribulation so here turns all you know everybody's like well he's got to come back in Revelations 10 he's got to come back down and reveal this that's where you get your return Ministry from but just really look at this very simple let's just take a minute we know Revelations 1-3 is the church ages correct that's not disputed Revelations 4 the very first verse there's a door open in heaven sister Anna and John hears a voice saying come up hither right in other words he's caught up right all right so now that doesn't end it for us spiritually right but it does end our Earthly Journey naturally and spiritually everybody understand right because what brother Brandon's trying to explain he's explaining that Revelations 4-19 is to a Jewish group of people on the Earth right a natural people because remember this Bible is written I know it's written to Christians but it's also written to the Jews cuz they're fixing to be a Christian right all right so it's written to them too and they literally get the happenings in this book amen all right but you and I get the spiritual application of it so in Revelations 4 let's look at it just run it through your mind just for a minute and if anybody has anything to say about it that's okay but Revelations to me chapter 4 brother Bram says right here he said and there's a fourth chapter rather and in that it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church going up amen see in Revelations 4 1 through 11 the whole chapter is showing us in heaven that we got there right how do you know you said why how do you know that there's one thing I can tell you when you see those combat beefs anywhere you see those combat beefs you see the bride right cuz remember on the fourth seal after the fourth seal what happened in the fifth seal brother Dan he said the Rapture took place cuz those combat beasts are gone right combat beasts are gone so when the combat beasts are gone where are they at they're in the bride so anywhere you see the combat Beast you see the bride right all right so here we see the combat beast in verse 6 of chapter 4 and he showing that the sea of glass remember brother Brown said it was sea of glass that judgment you know brass is Judgment showing judgment's done finished and we're there now in Revelation chap 5 to me God is working in order we're there then he drops back in Revelations 5 and shows us how we got there right right everybody understand that say amen amen okay that shows us how we got there right all right then Revelation 6 shows to the Jews but it shows us a spiritual application which that's we're not going to get into that right now stay in Revelations 5 cuz Revelations 5 to me is a foundation right it's a foundation that if you don't get it right a prophet had to bring the message and had to show it in continuity if not then you got all these doctrines that can't even that don't even they don't even read to me that's just like brother dick said that's just common reading to me that I can read that Revelations 4 that that it's showing us already there cuz if you come if you go up in a Rapture you've made it right but now Revelation 5 is we're going to know how we got there we're going to never forget how we got to heaven right that's going to be to me that's going to be an eternity eternity an eternal opening of how we got there all right so in Revelations 5 though shows a scene of that way that we got there all right so now start out in Revelation chap 5 the brides gone up the glory naturally right right then God goes to the Jews but now in the spiritual application because we got to look at this and see because remember remember what I said about a breach a breach is a breaking open or a breaking forth all right it's a breach of security or a bursting forth something is coming amen something is happening all right but in 41 we're in heaven verse 5 what happens let's start reading and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals right now that word seals came about there starting the thought process now I'm telling you this is the foundation so so when I get finished with this it's not going to we're not going to some Great opera we're not going to have a great ending here because this is going to continue all right but to get started sealed with Seven Seals now let's look and see in Ephesians what that seal is Ephesians 1 let's go back and just this may be Elementary to all of you and um you know what just let me stir up your mind okay let me just Stir It up and you know I found out one thing for sure at the at the uh Valentine's banquet we need to hear things over and over again cuz a lot of people got their left right and their right left and I told Daddy I said that's why you have to preach 60 something sermons on one thing we don't know our left hand from our right right yeah so in Ephesians 1: 13 and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth of the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed what is that building layers right you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise if you're born again tonight you're sealed amen if you're born again tonight you are sealed to the day of your Redemption right which is the earnest of our inheritance Earnest down payment first payment on the house not the full payment yet but the first payment right right until the Redemption of the purchased possession right flesh one more time flesh right God wants to dwell in flesh amen unto the praise of his glory now let's go to Ephesians 4 and 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed right unto something in the future right the day of redemption right all right now let's go back to Revelations 5 so let's keep in our mind that there's one seal amen the Holy Ghost has sealed you until the day of your Redemption exactly all right but I want to ask you a question we read that first verse John's the writer correct John yeah John's writing this he sees it so he's writing it John received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in ad30 right all right if you have a scofi Bible look at your right header note according to Usher Revelations was written in 96 John was a born again Christian for 60 years right okay yeah keep that in the back of your mind and I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof that's right verse three and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on right John is a born again believer amen I'm going to keep saying that and I wept much because no man was found wory to open and to read the book right neither to look thereon right John is a born again believer right believes in one God not a Trinity right believes in water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen believes in no eternal hell John is not a Baptist right or a Methodist or a presbyterian or Pentecostal he's a pure Born Again believer in that first church age cuz remember when John left patmas what did he do he went and pastored the church when Paul got his head chopped off he went to Ephesus and pastored the church in Ephesus until he died well my Heavens he was probably if he was 18 which he they said he was a young man when you know he laid on Jesus's bosom and he and he loved Jesus he was probably 18 years old he he's getting up in his 80s already cuz he's 60 years been born again 18 years that make him 78 already sitting on patmas so he was let me let me just put it this way John saw a lot am see I'm trying to bring this and humanize this this Foundation cuz we take when we say sealed everybody goes way up here no you're sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise right that's the seal all right and John is sealed right right amen born again Christian like I said he he don't have a denominational idea right amen he's a pure born again Christian why is he weeping you ever thought about that you said well what well hey he's crying about something right right John is seeing a scene unfold that he really can't comprehend yeah at that moment because remember remember John saw this is another key keep this in the back of your mind especially people in Sunday school class John saw Jesus in a glorified condition right on Earth before he ascended right so when he saw that Bloody lamb he turned and saw that Bloody lamb he saw Jesus amen and something caught him in his spirit and that's a little bit later own but just keep that as a key John saw Jesus go through the bloody lamb part sure the Resurrection The glorification and the Ascension and now here's John back writing he's sitting on patmas he's watching this Vision unfold and he looks and he does not see that man brother Bram said I think 97 and 9998 that in the breach he said everybody was there he even said Elijah Moses all the prophets all the great men when John wept he couldn't see anyone worthy exactly but wait a minute he's born again he's going to heaven yeah he's an eternal creature with God in his soul amen but 78 years old yeah he's dying right right John's having a problem everybody says they got their their you know their dissertation on why he we John couldn't see Jesus cuz remember what brother rown said remember he said the lamb was he said he couldn't see the lamb right cuz he was behind the The Throne we'll get to that in just a second but John is beginning to step in into something the foundation's been laid John is saw everybody in glory verse four in chapter 4 remember John's doing the writing yeah he saw everybody there in four now the vision has dropped back a little ways and he's like well how did they get there without that lamb yeah how did they get there John's born again the Holy Ghost Inside of him saying something's wrong yeah you you're still dying right all these people are already dead the prophets had already died they weren't resurrected but he saw them there in Vision correct all right he even said what brother BR said one time he said those that were dead were there all right but they weren't dead of course but they were there and here's John he's weeping yeah how can this be all right let's read know and back to verse three and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on right excuse me and I wept much because no man was found worthy John was looking for a man sure John wasn't looking for an angel John wasn't looking for some great glorious light he was looking for a man amen he was looking for a man with some skin right he wasn't even looking for he wasn't looking for a ghost or a spirit he was looking for a man right you know why cuz John had an understanding of what happened in the Garden of Eden right he knew what went on he knew what happened and in his mind he knew that that book was not in Adam's hand anymore right all right neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven SE seals thereof right now here's John listening to an angel a messenger amen someone saying something to him but he hadn't seen him yet okay right we still on the foundation let's don't get off stay on the foundation with me and I be held in low in the midst of the throne the middle right mid his middle in the midst of the throne and of the four Beast right and in the midst of the elders appeared a lamb stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes right which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth so John is seeing a repeat of Revelation chap 1 right one standing in the middle of the golden candlesticks what G about the P what Bride for him but now John sees this four Beast and the throne and he sees this lamb come forth just like he saw in Revelations 1 so here he's got um he's got that same man right in Revelations 1 he looked at him he said oh there's Jesus so I know everything's okay so he goes to rri all right so he goes to right and he writes all the way down through here and he gets to chapter 5 and he don't see that man but now he's come over here a little bit further and he sees that man again same characteristics standing in the midst of the candlesticks you don't have to say candlesticks but what's the seven horns and seven eyes right that's the kingdom the seven Church ages right the kingdom ages Church ages seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth so that's where it's going to happen in the church ages God is going to do the work of redemption through the church ages G but if this lamb does not take that book cuz see there's one sitting on the throne with a book in his hand if if if if that person doesn't get that book then the ages are going to just keep dying off yeah John's going to get older right he's going to feel it exactly all right but see in verse 7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now like the prophet of God said he said this is a scene and it's not a lamb right a lamb don't have a hand right a lamb can't take a book so it was in symbolic form it was Jesus doing his Redemption work through the ages right so there we see the foundation we see that God has built a found Foundation right Church ages lamb standing in the middle of it there's seven Church age Messengers to those Seven Ages all right but John beheld a lamb and he came and took the book so it had to be a human had to be a person couldn't be a lamb it had to be a person but he was doing the prophet said his mediatorial work and you know really when we talk about that we go back to the word breach because what did job want job come to a place to e just like John he saw a flower go down and come up he saw a tree go down and then leaves would come back up he said but I see man right go down and not come back right so elu had to come and speak to him yeah but he tells them and this is then for for him will I accept in Hamilton Indiana 1952 brother Brown says but yet job there's coming one a just one who will stand in the breach right and put his hands on a sinful man and a holy God and bridged the way stand in his place and make intercession for him then man shall rise again right all right also we see a second type Moses interceded this is in presuming 1962 God Called Moses out said I'm going to destroy the whole nation and see that's what God said to you and I after Adam forfeited that book remember you and I started dying right amen God didn't put a curse on us we cursed ourselves right like d said put we put oursel in the pawn shop all right God called out Moses out and said I'm going to destroy the whole nation just step aside Moses interceded throwing himself in the breach it was Christ in Moses you see God would have killed the whole world one time for sin but Christ throw himself in the breach for the whole human race Moses throw himself in the breach for Israel he said God you made a promise you made a promise that you would take them to the promised land Glory what did Moses do to God when looked like God was going to do something contrary he throwed the word in his way amen oh I love that now I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God can't walk over his own word John knew something had to happen or mind was going to continue dying good people born again people mind was going to continue to die unless not just remember wait a minute this was a bloody lamb he had died rose again but unless he took the book that Bloody lamb hear me out would do the flesh of man no good right some of his eyebrows are coming together did John did John die did Paul die they had the blood applied to them they accepted the blood amen but they died in flesh right right you see why I want people to understand it's just well you know those seals are it's just something so deep no it really is something that that's that's very simple if you break down the foundation get that Foundation get it good and hard get pack it down good that unless you and I receive the breaking forth of this revelation of this breach that we're going to continue to pass away right true because the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses all sin amen but if we don't accept it for this man right come on that's why John was weeping I'm going to say it again he had been born again for 60 years led by the Holy Ghost for 60 years yet he knew something else had to take place does everybody understand that something else had to take place right and you say why is it why are you nailing that down so hard because let me tell you something in this seal book in questions and answers on the seals the prophet I read it to him Sunday of course that's forward a bunch but they didn't ask him but one question about the seals they asked him about wearing blue you know pants to bed and all this stuff like that exactly but brother randam said it's gone from you you're not going to get it and you're not supposed to get it pretty hard to say to a group of people and I don't think they really heard what he said cuz they were shouting about something 5 minutes in the tape later yeah you know I would be going out the door or something my head I'd be down under the Pew or somewhere but what does he tell them to do he says live a good simple Christian Life let your light shine before man you know what he was doing he was saying there's nobody in this whole place is going to get what I'm saying in the fullness of the Revelation nobody you're all going to die brother dick that's what he was saying you didn't get it it's not for you and it's gone from you now folks it's time to look this thing straight in the face but watch what he said in continuation he said he talks about a radio he said there's waves going through this building he said there's radio waves in other words let me paraphrase it he said it takes a certain diamond to pick up a certain Channel you know what he was saying the diamonds wasn't there yet you know what I'm saying the diamonds are here now amen we have begun to dial in that radio you know how the of course a lot of you a lot of you kids are looking at me like I'm an idiot but there's there's something Beyond digital radio yeah used to we have to turn the dial and it was mostly a.m. yeah and if you didn't get it right on the right right it would pop and crack yeah and fade out right right I can remember when radio was an option in a car not just amfm was an option yeah I'm 51 seat belts were not even in a car you know or they were there you just never used them but anyway let's get what he was saying though he he was saying that that the right crystal was not there cuz in the old radio just to explain cuz I got a little time in a radio an old radio there was actually little Diamond crystals Y and Beyond the digital age you used to turn it down it had that little red hand it went across like this and it was on a runner but when you turn that dial and that Crystal run across a certain spot you could pick up that's why it was am55 is 55 mahz everybody understand that I sound like Aaron Roberts now 55 MHz everybody get this okay but at 55 mahz that diamond was cut a certain way that Crystal was formed a certain way that when that that when that wave come in from that antenna that stuck up all the time we don't have them anymore but that antenna stuck up all the time it comes down and when it comes in the back Danny what' it do it struck that just perfect and you picked up am55 then you had another one at a 650 and 750 and you see what I'm saying what brother R why did he use that illustration I don't think he just used common illustrations just to fill up time on a table amen I believe it was a purpose he said there's people going through this room and he said if we had the right receptor if we had the right cut of diamond we could pick them he said we could set a a radio right here and turn it on he was talking about TV but you can set a TV in here turn it on you can pick up that picture what was he telling that group of people brother brand to me was standing like John he was weeping cuz remember he said he said I'm only presuming if God don't come on the scene and open this book right brother Brandon was standing in the same place John was standing in right if something don't happen if that man don't take that book something got to happen happen and he didn't see it right then right cuz right here I'll read you in just a minute he said I don't know what the first seal is I don't know what to say silly he said we're only presuming he said I've been presuming for for down Through the Ages man has been presuming but there was brother Brown he'd been a born again Christian for about 40 years when he was breaking when he was standing in his place he was just like John he was weeping but when he turned he sees a lamb Glory but see brother brandham he had the book John didn't have this book right right John I don't know if John knew if that was a Bible or not but I know that brother brandham knew that it was a Bible yeah that that one was sitting on the throne with it in his hand so now here we've got brother brandom in the same place as as John but John in verse 7 the bible says and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne he who a man in flesh had to take that book then you'll remember brother randam goes to Revelations 10 and he says the mighty angel came down with the book that was open right right right exactly all right so now to see this scene let's just kind of kind of go forward just a little bit page 97 paragraph 290 this is way on in the message but listen to what he's trying to get the people to see now he preached the breach and then he preached the seals to 1 2 3 4 5 he preached number six on Saturday and he was going to preach he preached the U he preached the U questions and answers on Sunday morning and then he preached the seals on Sunday night right so it was on Sundays when he preached the revelation of the seven seal listen to this now watch when he done that watch what taken place you talk about a jubilee now he's talking about when the lamb takes the book now this is exactly the breaking of them seals take place we'll get into the half hour silent just after this watch this and we'll start in we'll finish this up next Sunday night right here everybody understand what I just said he said we'll finish this up finish this up next Sunday right here now what was next Sunday opening of the seventh seal right amen when all creation what took place when he did this in other words when he took the book so you see what did he do he took him right back to the foundation right the seventh seal wasn't something that went way out into history yeah right he took that seven seal and said we're going to come right back here to what Redemption when the lamb takes that book when he takes that book and what does he do he doesn't just hold on to the book he opens it right and when he opens it what does that mean you and I can look inside of it right right you and I can see the Revelation that been hid come on because Adam Adam lost that book Adam lost the ability to bring us all forth right right brother Tim he didn't have this book God had this book amen now listen you got to go back to symbols God did not have a literal King James Version Bible in his possession it was The Book of Life Glory Lamb's Book of Life cuz that's the only ones that's considered in Redemption right okay see because remember brother Brown speaks about the book and there sections in the book but this part in Revelations 5 is not talking about a foolish virgin right it's not talking about a cup of water in my name it's talking about it's not talking about just a regular book of life it's talking about the Lamb's Book of Life cuz who took it the lamb if it listen if this is my book and I take it this is Wade's book right when the lamb took that book it was his book amen so it was the Lamb's Book of Life right and who was he slain for everybody but the only the ones he came to get was the ones that was in that book right exactly so John knew that as long as Jesus didn't have this book may I say Jesus is that okay yeah cuz that was the bloody lamb right right all right not wasn't one sitting on the throne and then there's another person sitting out here come on people this is a scene God is on his foundation laying a foundation for us to be able to actually understand what's going to happen through those seals is that not true we got to get the foundation you say just Redemption John was already redeemed yeah right John was redeemed 60 years before this happened amen exactly but he was still dying right he was dead in his flesh right he had probably not saw Paul get killed but he knew Paul was dead yeah the great Apostle Paul was gone he was not there to help in Revelations 5 come on people right this scene better happen in our life right exactly amen and amen Foundation sword in a hand it's got to fit you right amen amen the word for the hour has got to fit your hand right foundation then you got to have enough strength to use it that's our problem amen that was John's problem amen he didn't have enough strength to use it and where do we get our strength amen amen right here this is where our strength comes from Glory right here not from gre's Almanac or McDonald's almanac for anybody listening in Jamaica yeah or it doesn't come from don't get me wrong all the preach sermons that we hear oh my and the Pastor said amen right amen it comes from what you got now that's the vehicle we get it from but it's got to come from you John typed the entire bride so if you don't see this not in the bloody Lamb's hand because where is the bloody lamb tonight yeah amen come on he's inside of you right so you who was that Bloody lamb that took the book yeah from the hand of the owner which was God Almighty himself son of man a man in human flesh right that was God not God sitting here you can't explain it by natural explanation exactly but I know Brother Dean and I talked about this a long time ago Lord Mercy you know 10 years ago when I first come back to the Lord you got to really you can't just see a you got to really be able to be there come on you got to really be able to be in that exactly in that Vision cuz if you look off somewhere that's just a story right that's a story being told right about brother dick Addison that's a song leader but if I become dick Addison right I don't have to ask questions about Dick Addison I've become dick Addison right right if I'm asking questions about Jesus Christ if I'm wondering about things guess what just become him like I said many times before somebody writes a book if some somebody writes a book and it's a wonderful book you can read that book and you're just an an onlooker John was an onlooker when he started weeping right John was looking at a SC right but see in my Revelation this is my part John sees that lamb come around from behind the throne right and take that book exactly something strikes John's heart he says that's my lord and savior he amen and amen he said although even though I'm born again right here inside there's something missing but now John as the literal person listen cuz he typed the bride but John as the literal person did not make a body change right but he saw that man in that scene take that book and when he took that book if John would have made it to the change John would have become that man right is that too much no if not it's a second person come on brother right say we got to read this Bible closer than we're reading it right amen amen because when I read a love letter about when June or I'm gone somewhere and I read a love letter it's like she's not sitting beside me she's me she's right here and I know exactly what she's thinking why' the prophet say that he never said he said no I I I can just feel her beside me no he said I know what she's thinking in her heart right not her in her heart her being right so when John saw that man take that book he said there's my savior now he has the complete plan and John this is just the way I see it John comes right over into that Vision because what does he do he has a shouting fit right but now even though John didn't make it now don't get me wrong John didn't take a body chain but he's typing the bride that will right right he's typing he he's come into that vision and he's not an onlooker anymore John wept because he couldn't what see a man amen but when he saw that man take that book I believe John just entered right into that Vision glory and John said let's read it and when he had taken the book the four Beast and the 4 and2 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vs full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou what slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kei Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth was there anything in there that said I because remember John is going I saw I I there's no more eyes yeah it's us right they right we right amen do you see what I'm talking about people we can't be an onlooker right we've got to be an active participant John was then not an onlooker he was an active par but and brother B said when he saw that said he shouted yeah and he said he shouted and I didn't bring it I was going to look it up but he said he shouted and shouted and shouted said he even looked and the vision broke and he actually saw his name wrote In the book right and that what he said saw his name wrote In the book now buddy let me tell you something John died but John Top's a bride can I say it again yeah John died but John topes a bride when the bride realizes who she is right and where she's at on and the position John saw position right let me tell you something folks if you ever see your name wrote in a book come on you can forget about everything else right right amen that's what I was telling the people downstairs I said look I said when that change happens we'll be finished here when that change comes the Bible says we which are alive and remain that's right to the coming of the Lord shall not hinder or prevent that's right those who are dead amen now folks let me tell you something it's going to take somebody alive to call those people out of the Grave I believe that it's going to take somebody alive to call those people out of the Grave right now folks let me tell you something they're already in their glorified body on if you have enough power come on that's it I'm not saying you but what's inside of you has enough power that's it to pull those people out of that grave and put them in a glorified condition let me tell you something folks death come up your sleeve death come on there's no way it's going to harm you there's no way it's going to harm you when you see those people and what the power of your speech come on Amen but let me give you another part of this story we're still in sinful bodies when that happens right come on we're still in sinful bodies when that happens when we call the dead out of the ground cuz the Bible says we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep that's right for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and they shall be changed then we shall be changed but it's going to be what you say that changes them before you even get changed so it's the power of what you have inside exactly so John entered in and become one with the vision amen everybody understand that cuz John was here John was like and I saw in the right hand of him and verse two and I saw and I wept but from verse 8 it ain't I no more right it's a group of people amen they when he took the book the four and four beasts yeah four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having everyone you know this doesn't say in the Bible that John did that that John screamed but brother BR said John screamed and started shouting right he must have been part of that group so he wasn't looking anymore he know he wasn't looking at anymore he was an active participant in what was going on so let me tell you something right here close the book had a few more things to say but I'm not going to say them listen to this you and I are now the crystals that's going to take this thing to a change exactly you and I have become God has tooken shave those crystals down that's what they do with diamonds right yeah and brought up people because look get this if you don't get anything else John typed the bride here we go again John was born again Christian for 60 years but John did not have a complete Revelation because Revelations 10:7 had not come to pass right but now folks Revelations 10:7 has come to pass right the tuner has tuned the dial right to the right receptor to the right to the right crystal those crystals weren't even in the radio when brother random was preaching this but he knew there was a group coming yeah that would accept this I believe that and would not be because even brother like I said brother brandham brother brandham would in his in his person was weeping don't tell me you was how can you preach to thousands of people and they and and God said right there's not a one them understanding what you're saying right wouldn't That Make You Weep yeah because what he saw this he saw a vision of a group of people right that was coming glory and they had not met yet but in the days of the right not the person not the man the days of the voice right of the seventh angel when he begins to sound that mystery that everybody was looking at that's right was finished amen when brother random preached the seventh seal then he brought them right back to Revelations 5 do you know he never read that scripture in the whole he said we going to come back right here next Sunday night he never read that scripture but he brought the two together right he brought the bride and he brought that Vision that John had in Revelations 5 of full Redemption Body Spirit and soul he brought them together amen now it didn't happen for him but he saw you hear what I said he saw right because he said in the days The Voice exactly of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound in other words you're going to become one with the mystery right most people think a mystery is something out here the greatest mystery go back to God in Simplicity is that God took a little man from Kentucky took him up the statue of a perfect man laid a foundation for the seals to be open and then through that little man through that whole week brought to Revelation right and then then what did he do he basically sealed it back up oh sure it was out there the boy you know I mean the message hadn't changed he didn't come back and preach anything else and he's not going to come back and preach anything else but what he preached was not understood cu the little crystals weren't here Gary Atkins wasn't here yet right dick Addison was still in the Presbyterian Church I was a baby I was a baby you still some of you weren't even born but listen God didn't lose you he knew you'd be right here right but we were out doing all things while this word was being made known but do you think he forgot nope cuz you were the receptor that he was looking for when I say he and I'm talking about brother brand I'm talking about God God was looking for somebody to accept that message but when he brought it you and I weren't there so guess what we're here amen let's take this now as a foundation glory and let's move on thank you Lord okay we've got to become one with this thing people amen amen we cannot be an active partic I mean we can't be an onlooker we got to be an active participant thank you Lord we've got to be able to not quote every quote not not know every mystery to say well boy I know this from here to here no but our calling is not just to live a good Christian Life Now L's stand it's not people I know it's I know that's that's 100% of it but it's not all of it right you live a good Christian Life you'll do like John right you'll die right amen was John was a born again again Christian for how long 60 years but when John come down to Revelations 5 because what happens right after Revelations 5 God just breaks right out into the seal amen it starts breaking one 2 3 4 all the way down okay so that's what I want God to do to each one of us right I want us to not not not say well I understand c one I understand Seal two I got number three oh grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed with Seven Seals one right one seal but there's seven in there that's going to change this whole body amen and it's going to make it in a glorified condition but when you're reading now when you're studying pray to God say God don't just let me know the message just remember last time I when I when I ministered I said let's don't let this just be a quote let's don't let this just be head knowledge right cuz head knowledge will take you nowhere but when but when John if John was able and type the bride and was able to come together and be one with that Vision then guess what that's for assurity brother Al somebody's going to do it right cuz remember it's a vision exactly when God shows a vision there in Revelations remember he sees from the beginning to the end he seen all that and it was finished because what see brother R have a vision he'd have a vision what it hadn't even happened yet naturally where did that come from that had to come straight from the mind of God cuz God knew what was going to happen God just let that Prophet enter into that vision and be able to see what was going to happen and I was telling him downstairs not just to see the vision but remember he talked about the Hat talked about things that had to be in place cuz if a hat was laying on a couch and he walked in that room and that hat was like laying on a TV he said watch let me give you this story one one last story I was going to do it earlier but let me do it now watch here's a prophet of God had enter had already entered into Vision saw what was going to happen right exactly but even he said I can't tell the people to move it right somebody has to walk in here and move that hat that's right and he said he sat there with that little baby screaming and crying and the mother saying brother Brown pray for the baby and he said I just sat there why the Hat wasn't in the place he saw it at the vision but now when whoever the was the woman come in she picks the Hat up She lays it over on the couch first thing he does he steps up he walks right over there and he lays his hands on the baby and God healed the baby amen you say well boy that's just that's just what that's what God saw and that's what had to happen but even a prophet of God couldn't move that hat right it had to be a human being right it had to be somebody somebody else right to move that that's right right think about that on her own right exactly exactly yeah he couldn't he couldn't make no suggestions he couldn't make no there wouldn't be no thought process you know the person just naturally walking through life he just reached over and moved the hat right and then what happened everything clicked right and that's what God's waiting on Amen he's waiting on for that Vision that he saw he wants everybody in their place everybody in their position everybody doing what they're supposed to be doing and then guess what the Rapture is going to take place let's sing4 194 and the red button let's sing and worship glorify godet a gentile number with

have you ever took your pen and H and and wrote over the words breach come on the days of underlining should be over I know and and that's that's not telling you not to ever do that what I'm saying is though we look at that book and we say boy that's a good quote and we underline it that means it's out there yeah but if we see that and it becomes here right then it's written Epistles known and red of all men you and I Glory let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord I pray that what we've said tonight Lord was pleasing to you Lord and I pray Lord that you would just go with us be with us fill us with your Holy Spirit Lord as the song says keep our lamps trimmed and clear Lord that's something we have to do Lord just take out all the things that hinders us Lord all the sin in our life and the unbelief Lord help us to become this not just yes Lord Lord uh looking at something and and saying oh that's that's too far that's too hard or or that's for someone else no I I the Bible said that the lamb had overcome and took the book what a bold statement he had overcome he had wrestled and won and Lord you didn't just be the Overcomer yourself but you being the first one you gave us an opportunity to become Overcomers and all down Through the Ages you had your Overcomers but Lord in the last age you made it personal father to end it up in Revelations 3 it says that you are giving us an invitation to sit with you in your throne not on not beside but in yes Lord as you overcame and set on your father's throne in your father's Throne Lord that means they become one and father that's what our prayer is tonight yes Lord that we become so one with you Lord till all the hatred and Malice and grief and worries of life and trouble and heartaches and and things of life just fade away because Lord you promised there in Revelations 5 we see that we're in glory and Lord you told us we'd be Kings and Priests on this Earth down here and Lord I pray that that a little bit of that would come to each one of our life yes Lord that not wait for over there to be Kings and Priests cuz we know that's going to happen but Lord you gave us you told us to come boldly to the throne of grace Lord I pray tonight any sickness any disease nothing is impossible for you Lord absolutely nothing is impossible Lord you had a man named John standing on that island he was old in age probably tired and weary but oh when he saw you take that book yes Lord when he saw you take that book and climb up and set down on the throne my what a place to be I believe John if he had arthritis it left him yes if he had anything wrong with him being tired and weary I think it left him cuz your Prophet said he shouted and Heaven heard him and Earth heard him and all even the ones Under the Sea everybody heard John singing and praising God yes Father just I pray just give us all a little bit of that and especially Brother Dean I pray you'd give him a double portion because tonight I feel very well so Lord you can take my portion and give it to him father come down and anoint us Lord anoint us for this journey that's what it is Lord as tonight we've started on a foundation that didn't end it zerubabel built the temple back to its condition and it become a shining glory for Israel for many years until they began to sin again and you destroyed it but but you did say that that same zerubabel would come back and build on the foundation and Lord this time it would be a mighty mountain and a mighty Mountain that will not be torn down yes Lord father I pray that you just be with us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit thank you for coming Among Us Lord in a special way sweetness and and humbleness of spirit father just go with us now may we take the things that's been said and and not just take them as Idle Words but Lord take them in our heart use them take that sword now we've got some more strength that's what I believe Lord every Sunday every Wednesday every time we listen to the tape talk about you that gives that Mighty hand of Faith just a little bit more strength because Lord nobody has ever took the sword of the word and put it through Satan's heart except you you took the keys of death and hell away from him and he's powerless and he's a bluff as we'll see later on Lord through the seals but you hold all the keys Lord help us to realize that that that key to death and hell is now laying on our side if we become one with you Lord then we have what you have we're HS and join HS yes Lord not a lesser person father that's what you wanted man to realize when you spoke in Genesis 1:26 you wanted man to realize that we are God on the earth and that you have given us the ability to rule and Reign because it comes down from Genesis 1 126 to rule and Reign and here we are in Revelations 5 it tells us to be Kings and priest Prest and the prophet said one time he said to be a king and a priest you got to have somebody to rule over yes Lord Lord just let our Holy Spirit rule over all things all powers all enemy anything that comes Among Us Lord let the Holy Spirit bind together and we'll take that sword and we'll take it I believe we've got it right at the devil's heart because there's only one thing left and that's death destroyed in these bodies father help us keep us be with us be with our pastor be with the deacons be with the elders be with everyone in the sanctuary Lord just take us and mold us into your image bless us and be with us father as we go as we take your name the lovely name of Jesus Christ with us everywhere we go amen amen
