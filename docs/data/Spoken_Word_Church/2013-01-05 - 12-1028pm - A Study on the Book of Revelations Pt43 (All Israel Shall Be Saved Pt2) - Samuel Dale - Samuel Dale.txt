got announcement to make just real quick brother Manny is kind of taking care of the Atlanta Journal papers those of you that went through the couponing flashlight last Sunday you may see last Sunday and just remember to get in touch with him because we're going to start doing it on a monthly basis we're going to start paying him up front that way he can get his money you shouldn't have that in your emergency fine or your coupon fund one but just remember to see brother Benny when you uh when you leave and also given your email address if you're doing your couponing thank you brother you need to show a pants to make too many videos oh who needs the papers let me see the video of who wants to watch the video that was not here for the true couponing class that sister Michelle did last Sunday who needs a copy of that okay excuse me 16. so just make about 20 copies again he's about 17 that's about right 17. all right but anyway and what we're doing is I want to just kind of give you a little brief overview this is not just something to waste time with it's saving money but sister Michelle kind of came to us and gave us a a way last Sunday of of getting a food bank started in your church the way the couponing thing works is you say different kinds of coupons during this during the course of a month out of both paper then you take that you do a buy one get one free you do a two for one you do all these things but anyway like like you know Benny gave me eight rolls of rock guard one day and I thought why are you wasting money he said I got them all for like 80 cents sell them to somebody they'll just give them away but you can't do that but what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to get a food bank or a personal hygiene whatever you want to do whatever you want to call it together as a church and that way like with brother Timbo and Esther getting married and if some of you fall on the hard times we can put it in a box we can store at my house downstairs wherever we want to store it we can take that box and give it to you and it will house how many are you going to use eight cans of rice or anything to rock garden foreign but you know you're saying what are you going to do with eight tenths what keep one for yourself take the other seven and put them up then when somebody comes along with hard times or somebody needs a can of this or a can of that you know sister Michelle showed us at Walgreens they had this big huge huge pallet full wasn't it this high right everybody was there that pallet was this High full of drinks and miscellaneous items and four buggies at Walgreens they spent four dollars and 17 cents and you said well Walgreens well they do that if you'll go to that true couponing website Walgreens has put an ad on the one I saw Thursday that's begging people to come we will take your coupons see they get paid by buying them they get those manufactured coupons they get that money back plus they get eight cents to handle it so they're not losing money they're making money but Walmart I mean Walgreens if you're bringing a pallet out and putting a pallet in the manager the store associates and all those people get a bonus off of what they sell the volume so even on that true couponing the one in Sarasota Florida said we will accept and help you with your couponing so don't be don't be shy with doing this this is a great way like sister Michelle said it's a great way to bless somebody else God bless you to do what you're doing then you bless somebody else Jim the other day just kind of didn't have a coupon but she was using some a coupon somewhere and got like how many things of chapstick you know so so you see what I'm saying put some of those up and we'll we'll get a kind of a thing going where we can save some of that stuff and somebody gets married like Timbo hey how many of you would like to have a stock shelf when you first got married hello everybody we all won you know you'd open yours up and the mouse is going you know when you and I got married you know the mouse was poor as we were so but now we'll be able to bless somebody what I'm saying is it's not a con game it's not something these people want you to do that you know why it's brand recognition if you'll study all this stuff a lot of you that are in that are in retail and in marketing it's brand recognition what you see if you see a lot of Right Guard then guess what sooner or later you're going to buy some Right Guard or this or that yo so use these coupons get with brother Benny if you have any questions go to that truecouponing.com it will help you buy groceries even actually the other day from work she got online she saved 33 dollars going to Kroger out of about 100 worth of product which she saved 30 percent you know on her own her bail on her group on her food bill so it's just something that's that's added to what we're doing with the Dave Ramsey course and I want to thank all of you that went through it most of you probably 90 of the church has been through it uh we paid off roughly in my figuring in my head about 75 000 in debt and from the two classes saved about thirty thousand dollars and avoided in close to four hundred thousand dollars in debt so give yourself a big hand because you're the one that did it and that's real money that's just not something that you play with so you know what God's Gonna bless you by blessing others all right and that's what we're here for we're here to bless other people not to bless ourselves you ought to know that from our pastor he's the greatest lesser of anybody I've ever seen in my life you know he does allow us to bless you so we're just giving some of that back so that we can help others and I want to thank each and every one of you for the gift on your last class you should not have done that but thank you to all of you that were in the second class you gave Junior and I a very nice gift a monastery gift that we're going to use and uh take off a weekend maybe and kind of recuperate a little bit so thank you each and every one of you I appreciate it it was money and time well spent and I hope that was in your budget I hope that was in your budget what you gave me because June and I because we didn't deserve that we did it we do it for free we always do it for free because we love you guys we want to see you do that if you do

found out this morning and it's true you need to share your faith every opportunity you get right yeah because if you don't one day you'll forget how right that's the next thing you know you forget you even say anything yeah that's good let's go about the day amen Open the Eyes of My Heart foreign all the way all the way home damn it then we used to look into the word and we'll find him amen see you back in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn them back where we've been reading from Revelations 1 and revelation 6. how to continue the thought on this morning but we'll back up and leave you just a little bit back over to where we were maybe and try to speak on a little bit remember the announcements remember that brother Forney will be here with us Lord willing preaching Wednesday and remember that this coming weekend will be Bible study yes you'll remember that and come and be with us all the other announcements father we thank you for your loving your grace and thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely and we thank you and we pray that you would just guide us now as we talk about you I'm talking about the Plan of Redemption that's it to see how others are redeemed and we see how that we are redeemed Lord we see that there's nothing worthy in any of us anywhere of any form or any people that have brought a Plan of Redemption unto us but it was because you promised it so now you've promised in this end time to open your word so now we ask you to do that and just got each one less the sick among us come and touch each one and just have your way in Jesus name amen Revelations one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants names which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God into the testimony of Jesus Christ remember what we're saying this morning now the testimony of Jesus Christ watch the others in a minute they have their own testimony but not this and of all things that he saw him they said is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony in which they hailed see not the testimony of Jesus Christ but the testimony they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true this thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled he may be seated the Lord had his blessings of the reading of the word now I was go back into the message this morning and then come back down to an end part so just bear with me who we've seen as the prophet said this is not the bride he used to think it was right that's right he used to think it was the bride of Christ the soldier under the altar that were martyred down through time right and he said that was not correct right and uh you know that he seen what it was and he said this is Israel to be saved as a nation right well see we never dealt with that Redemptive form of Israel being saved as a nation right we haven't dealt with that on the uh the prophet did but we haven't gotten into that to speak on it much because we've not heard a lot of ministers ministering on these things right amen but I believe it's time to understand the full Plan of Redemption and as I was telling my wife this morning if we don't get ever placed in other words each one in place of the Redemptive plan then we leave a gap in the Plan of Redemption seeing we wouldn't have to fully reveal Plan of Redemption so by way of the Prophet messenger my way that we've been bringing it see we can see the complete plan for everybody amen Old Testament Jews has a place the uh you know the bride of Christ has a place the uh the foolish virgins has a place to only 44 000 has a place amen and now we're talking about the fifth seal and their place and part in The Plan of Redemption that's right and I've told you over and over that to me and I've always preached it that way the greatest plant the greatest thought of of Grace it could ever be written in the word of God that's right he is not you and me you know right it is Israel right that God Will Save Right as a nation to give them eternal life one day and that they will you know then no way want it right they rejected it and they did not even 144 000 grew now to me when when you when I say 144 000 and you'll see more as we go along I'm putting that 144 000 together with the the Israel of God because you cannot separate that too no all right the brother said to him a while ago he said uh and then when they're crying how long he said they're wanting that 144 000 to come on you're right they want to see what's going on right you know and uh but just think on these things now so we covered this morning and brought it down to to seeing that uh Paul said all Israel Romans 11 26 right along in there talking about all Israel would be saved now if you enjoyed the verse after verse of the scripture the word is true like I said I believe God opened them all to understand it right because he cried out you may not have I may not have finished my point but Solomon wanted wisdom and God saw that in his heart so he gave him wisdom and understanding of him and all and Paul wanted his people he saw was burden for his people Israel that's right until I believe he was crying out constantly and he was constantly quoting the scriptures of the Old Testament prophets and things that would talk about the Israel of God and so he didn't I believe the Lord just opened his eyes and let him see right down to the time that he said all Israel shall be saved right well we know that all Israel is never the right point to use we'll get to it in a minute that were he never said all Jews would be saved he said all this will be saved right amen he didn't say all Jews he didn't bring it that way so you'll get the point in a minute when we get to it but to see the Plan of Redemption for Israel and see the crying in Paul's heart you see God answering that with a revealing of the word unto him about what would happen to Israel after we leave out here right that's a great understanding no wonder Peter would say Paul says things hard to be understood and he said they that are not learned rational to their own destruction you know I mean he was he Peter new Paul was saying things and Paul said I saw things I can't talk about right amen well maybe he saw that fifth seal Jew you know maybe he saw his own people saved and he'd come back to try to tell him how can you tell it right because you came early childhood at night you know you can't even hardly get the people to see that there is a people that will be there right because God promised them to be there right and it won't be that they get borned again here right they have to receive eternal life somewhere though right but yet they'll be there in the great times if our own and won't it be wonderful to be able to think about that I've always wondered about the scripture because it says it will sit down at the welcome table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob right and my brother Tatum he always loved that scripture he quote that a lot and you know they're going to be at the welcome table right well I've always took it to be the welcome table would be the the marriage supper of the Lamb you know I mean that's what I believe it is and it may be something else too but I believe they'll be there I believe there's going to be there's always company in the wedding you know man and there's always a group of people in a wedding supper other than just the quote family you know members you always have guests of honor and things you know to be there but now see what up I ended up talking about and we gave it that even this this sealed Jew and I had never tied that together until our Wednesday night as it began to unfold and that's when I love to preach all right man I love to preach when I'm seeing something unfold that I haven't been preaching on it like that you know amen and uh I always just took the 144 000 has to be in the uh partial it you know we'd be dealing with Daniel 70 weeks right but then we gave the quotes there this morning where the Prophet said in the sixth full purpose right that that those people were blinded Their Eyes Were blinded right see the 144 000 is blinded I'm not sure so this puts 144 000 in the field still Jew kind of together in a way of understanding because see the 144 000 were blinded just as well as the other parts that were killed down through there they were blinded and they would be part of those groups coming down right that it would be the Israel of God you know God's chosen Nation and he gave and we were reading where Paul said this is my Covenant with them well if Abraham had a covenant it was certainly an unconditional Covenant nobody done anything to deserve it nobody was something special that would make them uh think is the reason that they're saved that's right and you can just you you start preaching like that and you can see people's Expressions as a kind of you know and you're kind of wondering maybe do they think that there is some good reason that they don't forget the inside is there any good thing you could do for salvation when Paul would explain that you could even give your body to be burned right right you know I mean you give everything in the world you had and that's the only gonna save you that's right amen all right that's that's just let's just get it down to the fact of what salvation really is it's the grace of God imparted unto mankind you're regardless of what category we're in it's not so we saw as it said in the Gabriel's instructions to Daniel paragraph 48 and 49. that these people in the that he's talking about under the six-fold purpose without the end of their sins done away and finish the transgressions and the things and all and it will probably apply to them as they see it so then truly Paul was correct if we see the 144 000 and like I said this morning then we'll get into it maybe in another service we're down and even mistaken out yeah Joseph and Levi's put in by doing that we know for a certainty there's going to be more than 144 000 in the millennium the prophet said to this then the the 144 000 would be in the millennial range right man all right so there's going to be more there than just what we think maybe all right so let's pick up the point where Paul is saying truly all Israel will be saved right God is going to save his people right we were talking about it at lunch dinner and what's the difference in God's people you know they were a chosen Nation Etc sure why didn't they get eternal life well there's some specific reason why and I I don't know why but for some reason he chose a gentile bride I don't understand that I'm truthfully I believe it got a part of it but maybe it's because it would be a gentile which would not mean just all that has said all Africans are all Germans whatever it would be everybody including Israel would have an opportunity of Salvation because of this diet this part started off with Jews that's right absolutely 120 in the upper room would Jews right I mean all right so our roots it's Jewish of the natural and our roots are Jewish in the spiritual right amen dude he didn't go out and get all the Gentiles and bring them in right until after he brought the Holy Ghost name amen all right see then we're dealing with 144 000 you're dealing with only the elect not ever Israelite right amen when Paul was saying all Israel will be saved he didn't say all Jews he didn't say all Israelites he had he said that then God would have to save everyone but he said all Israel Israel is a reference to chosen it's like Jacob's name was changed right to Israel all right so then that means the chosen of God so there is a chosen group of people they were blinded amen so you and I could have eternal life amen so we couldn't need to quit tooting our horn who we are and look at who we are how did we get here right what did God have to do to get us a lot right amen a whole lot all right but now watch let's start off then where we left off on we was on number 10. so let's pick up the scriptures on number 11 and you'll notice we read this morning in Romans 11 13-26 or something 29 or something right Perfect all right so let's go to third number ten read it then go from there going down on a six-fold purpose you'll be Able's instruction oh I got 49. God cut them off purposely and blinded your eyes so that we can have a chance to see giving us an opportunity when we walk around like we're somebody yeah Paul tells him here take heed of how you do that take heed for God's spirit not the natural brain Israel how will we have any more Mercy will he have any more Mercy on the wild range right that's already what it's the Messer junk right do we walk around saying I'm Presbyterian I imagine this I'm bad this I'm Pinnacle I'm Grandma's now I hated that one right now okay let me add that one in there all right that don't mean nothing to God right no that's right amen you got to be born again of that Holy Spirit that come from the root that's right remember Jesus come from the tribe of Judah right not Naturally Speaking spiritually all right and remember he's not speaking of the Gentiles I'm just throwing this in here so that you can see where the Gentiles at they're changed they come to Phoenix with transgression make a finish of it right all right now let's read verse let's go to the Romans 11 go to verse 1 through 13. now and you see what God is saying I say then if God Cast Away his people nosy Thomas Israel God forbid right in other words no where I also am an Israelite of the Sea of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin I used to think that he was giving that to try to show his legs but you know I believe now what he's doing he's giving that to show that he's the dirtiest of all and if he can see the dirtiest of all because he said he's the chiefess of sinners and God can save him he can save anybody you know what Paul even caused them to blaspheme now that's pretty bad no wonder them Fellers were scared of me in the book of Acts I mean wouldn't you be scared of somebody to come in here and turn it all of us in and they come in here and wipe the whole place out just about it and then I'll come walking back in you know all right y'all love me don't you no one's afraid of me all right but he don't know what I might do all right but now watch God has not Cast Away his people which he forew would you not what the scripture said to visas there's Isaiah Our Lives civilization how do you make this intercession to God against the Israel say Now read Isaiah and see what he's saying Lord Lord is in is is pleading the calls with God and Lord they have killed our Prophets and dig down to an altars and I'm left alone and they seek my life watching but once said the answer of God unto me I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image above even so then at this present time also there's a remnant according to the election of Grace all right now ain't it by grace it is no more of words otherwise Grace is no more grace but if it really works then it is no more grace otherwise works is no more work man you know I kind of jumbled up don't it but look at it like this in plain sense it ain't nothing good what we've done or hadn't done that ain't got anything to do with it it's what he done and we can count our works as being something great work sin will just be worked right and all we've done is tired right you're tired because you work that's the basis of it just a good old mule right Murphy's a little chef to death he used to plow them they just plow all day long but you better be careful he's standing in the stall you think he's sound asleep and he walked by him and you kicked the far out of him worked them had a lot to do with them laughs the reason I did I've been down through there doing a lot of work in myself I would try I was good on you when I was in the bed right all right look what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh far right now watching the vehicle you ain't got it yet right right but the election have obtained it and the rest were blinded now if that ain't enough to show you what God has done right right yep the elect is those that come into the body of Christ the other is Israel has not obtained that which he seeketh far you haven't got it yet but the election hath obtained it the people have come in to be the bride Paul Peter James John Jews right right and the rest were blinded what according as it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see in the years that they should not hear unto this day and watch David now this is crying out for this fifth sealed Jew the children of Israel and David said let their table be a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them right let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back always he's not saying make that be he said that's what it's going to be how they stumble that they should fall God forbid amen but rather through their fall salvation is coming to the Gentiles part of provoke them to jealousy they're mad they're in there you go over it right man you get pushed around I was standing I told you about it I was standing getting ready to eat and I mean I was this close to the in the barn and the lady was serving us and this lady came up between me and nothing and got my food excuse me and then because she wouldn't go away all right I say to them have that strong limitation phone God forbid but rather through their false salvation just coming to the Gentiles more to provoke them to jealousy sure that's the dirtiest thing in the world for a Jew to think we're saved oh yeah absolutely I mean right you don't think we're saved he just using America you don't love America right evidently got something they can take the whole thing for right amen sure listen now to fall of them be the riches of the world because it extended down to time and do it right and the dimension of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness right amen what about a time now then you pick up where we left off this morning and all Israel will be saved all Israel will come to Salvation now listen to what the prophet had to say about it number 12. I have a question and answered on the sale of paragraph 120. now yes these dudes are not all the Jews will be saved no sir they will not be saved only those who when he's speaking of of Jews Jew just is a name that was given to give to them after they left I believe never can ever over begin to call them Jews first because the tribe of Judah was taken then and given the name of Jew so if you ever need that you know that the prophet is covering it where the Jews were come in but the first word Jew is in um the Book of Esther because they came down from Judah and that they got the name of Jew but now Israel is different Israel and Jew is all together different I really that's right every Jew ever Jew isn't an Israelite all right you only deal with one tribe no he's just a Jew right but in Israel Paul never said all Jews will be saved that's right he said all Israel will be saved why Israel's name that's that's the name of Redemption all the way back right amen Israel is a name of redemption then all Israel will be saved but not all Judea Judaism uh we'll be saying all the Judaism and all that they will they won't be saved that's right amen why because that's not to you know that's not to be right all right let's see who this group is 4 45 in the field seal he's talking about Elijah Spirit coming down and what would take place now we find out in revelation 22 8 the same thing now or to settle it for those who the old souls now watch it under the altar of the breaking of this seal and that's then you can see them right that had been slain in the between time between the death of Christ and the going up to the church so there's your field sealed Jew between the death of Christ and the going up all right of the church the Eichmann group and all that them true Jews with their names on the book sure no only the ones that will ever be redeemed is or named on the book okay no matter who we are amen it's got to be on the book before the foundation of the world right if you watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry out speak here and had all five sanctions yep now they sold run to the Alder if he'll Shield you that's where I used to have it wrong I used to preach it that the theophany or the souls like that under the altar didn't have any senses it was just eternal life but I had to correct that in my my teaching because I began to see that brother Brown when he went beyond the curtain of time and we'll get to that in another message that's called Souls under the altar do not defeated you now right right when you say soldier under the altar how long wrote a randomly apply that to the bride right but when you say soldier under the altar how long to avenge our blood can't be the bride no that's right all right so then you'll see that as we go along the time between the death of Christ and going up the Eichmann group and all that were their name their them true Jews with their names on the book if you watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry and speak here and our all the five senses do we know for certain that was the soldier on the altar because the Bible called that not sleeping in the grave unconscious we'll cover that in a message there is a doctrine of Soul sleep right and there is a scripture that says the dead no not so they use that to to try to say that when you die you just you're just gone you're called Soul sleeping yeah yeah but everyone said don't believe that so you'll see that's another message they were very much awake I'd like to do that because I couldn't want to go and Julie come by and she said over my head this morning when you said Dan and Ephraim yeah and I tied in so I just gave her the places in the church age book and it's under the seventh seal if you want to read them it's 270 Church age book up to about 281 or two write it down and read it tells you about all the things that happened and then under the seventh seal missing numbers but it's over in the seventh seal he deals with Dan and Ephraim being taken out and put back so if you want to study it it's not all right they were very much awake and could talk speak hear anything is that right oh help us so those Soul drunk though sold under the order the fifth sealed Jew is not just a dead much or nothing hmm me just like beyond the curtain of time those were a well alive bunch of people that run around could feel see here right all right but their name my point is their names are on the book go to the next one they're 14. or page 274 the church handbook sardisian Church age this is not to suggest that there will be more names from the tribes of Israel remaining be will be no more names from the tribes of Israel remaining in the book of life for many of those but molecules through the principle of election will be in the Gentile Church yeah that's fine and coming through the body of Jesus Christ joined up their names did indeed remain in the book also also we will show according to the fifth seal multitudes of Martyrs martyr Jews we'll be giving white robes and eternal life by the Lord also the 144 000 would be sealed in his coming proven that their names were not deleted all right now he always believed that the souls under the altar was the early church go ahead with that one I think I used it this morning but we'll reuse it again I got 104 The Sixth Seal I always lie that soldier in the altar into the early Christian Church Martyrs but we found out last night when the Lord broke that seal for us it absolutely is impossible right it wasn't them they were gone on to Glory talking about the bride right well I'm on the other side and the Earth day was we found out that they were Jews that would come up during the time when the from the calling now of the 144 000 watching now which we get into tonight and tomorrow and between the sixth and seventh seal 144 000 is called the word is this Jew gonna come up during so now he's putting 144 000 in the field sealed you right together in one statement are you reading it we found out that they were Jews they sealed you it would come up during the time where the from the calling now of 144 000. which we get into tonight and tomorrow night and between the sixth and seventh seal 144 000 is called and then we find out that they were martyred that had been killed and yet had not yet been had white robes on but their names had been in the last book of life and they were given white robes each one of them are you going there and separate 144 000 from the fifth sealed you come on Reed you're supposed to read you can't separate them he's got them all together well we got a quote we'll get to later on another message we're going to run and said they're giving why I rode under the seventh seal right then we'll be back in a minute talk about that as to when will they get those rooms and what will happen but I want to cover one thing for certain he said well now I'll just believe right around you just take everything from it's all right I think we ought to you and what's wrong can be corrected and he didn't correct it we better watch what we do with it but now he gives evidence of why this is not the bride right well let's go through that and then we'll drop back go ahead to a number 16. I took part of the evening message shoved it up into the morning and we go okay that's why it's not underlined all the other would get it underlined page or paragraph 252 the fifth seal yes they held the word of God they were Jews they had their law they stayed with it and watch what they said they had their wall they stayed with it they keep the law right now they still set the tables they do everything just as according to their passovers and they do everything even at the Passover like well he was covering years ago and to pass over they have a play set for Elijah and they get up and they go to the door they opened the door and if he doesn't come in to close the door and set another year until next year until next year no they're keeping that law sure he's not gone about Wall Street punch right right right real crew Jews right right look around to dinner plowing yep the wooden Blaster right now we used to have wood glass knocks but we know what they got they got one thing and it goes down we've seen them when we're over there not two animals like we do they got one plow tank he's going and they probably even use wooden clowns but if it couldn't be that mental out to do it and he was something else all right but what they had their Lawless name with it you're a real nice night now they stayed with that and they were Jews and had a law and the law was the word of God they stayed right by it that's right now that's the fifth field you right the one who stayed with the word yep not everybody see all the Israel's not Israel right right man I want to do it all Israel's Israel but not all Jews right this and he says in that which we've read for the testimony they held what is their testimony what is the testimony of a true Israelite we are God's people Rabbi Richmond said I can't blame you can't have it that God chose us imagine their testimony is not of Jesus Christ their testimonies of the word to Hell the law that Jehovah right had given them amen they were martyred and year was sold under the altar after the church has been gone amen now watch they added their blindness martyred their Messiah and they were rich now they were reaping for it yeah and would you mind reading that next few words for me when I put this cough drop in no congregation reading they realized it what did they realize yep now where are they going to realize it yep that's right when are they going to realize it he's talking about Phil seals you ain't talking about 141 000 right you tell me if they'll see what you do look like Phil see what you one day is going to realize amen right and we're at William that he recognize after it was going on they've seen then when they come before the altar of God that's right I thought we were supposed to believe amen they're under the altar of God absolutely I saw shows under the altar right is that Revelation 5 how many Revelations 6 verse 9 right yes what altar of God they got a place yep if you understand That Old Testament people had a place you know what that was the faith of Abraham right made a place made a paradox now these are not put over there in the paradise it was left no no no amen Paradise was taken up amen the Bible says the prophet says that's right so this is under the altar they sing when they come before the altar of God now some were they're going to see the truth absolutely they'll cry how long to avenge but now you show me how afternoon them crying how long I want revenge either when they come out of that Altar and see what's happened they don't want revenge anymore they're giving my robes and we read it to you in Revelations right and was told to rest a little season until their fellow Brethren right right list them 144 000 right right a sealed so right prior to the ceiling of the 144 000 are them being taken away in their Redemptive plan you're gonna have to have us fulfilled you to receive eternal life I've always thought and I've always taught it from Kristen Moon that they would have to go to the white Throne judgment and receive eternal life I no longer believe that no no because if they get white rose before the 144 000 are killed is a vast amount of time before the watch on judgment comes which is like a millennium a thousand years and different things right and you can't take somebody to the white throne and stand before the white throne with eternal life absolutely not amen come on man don't take nobody to the watch room we got a judge with the Deeds Done in the body where they're good or bad and that's no why it's wrong come on that's 144 000 don't go to the white throne but yet they're not under the Bride of Jesus Christ right I said well I don't know that's what I said we miss and we did amen they come before the order of God now the grace of God is to them now watch now they could not by no means be Saints because they're already be Road but here they are now just sold Under The Altar for the word of God and the testimony of the hell for being God's people the Jews and that's something that's right how did they see him on the internet now they're slopping their gums that's okay but it's got to be salvation to Jesus Christ amen nobody goes to heaven without the Regency plan of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't care whether Jew Gentile or whatever it's through the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen the Old Testament sanctions as I said this morning the blood of Jesus Christ paid their price right that paradise could be taken up amen it was all through Jesus Christ Don't just run all see please but now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe right watch come over after the church is gone so they don't happen till we get out of here right nope two points probably said they don't have them do we get out of here the Bible says they don't have it until I turn this to the 144 000. right but no one just probably tell you what I'm playing folks Brother Gary because you don't miss this point I don't believe when that receive eternal life now listen very closely I don't believe they get it until we get out of here right because if they've got eternal life they'd be in the bride right exactly right sure they're not giving eternal life until we leave I'm like I said and the brother caught it he said they're crying how long waiting on them 144 000. yep they feel the bull yeah that's right right yep but don't take them to the white room if I'm corrected by that I'll be glad to take correction if you can show me but for 40 something years I've studied that not just a week ago trying to see and understand sure made a lot of statements of my own but I'm always glad to come here and say all right I don't believe that anymore amen that's no problem to me well these people I don't believe what you said well maybe God will take care of it because I answered in good conscience right I don't mind telling you when I see you all right Jesus gives each one a white Road watch or more after the church had gone because they were all the way up to their calls and they were blinded and they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly the part of God right part that God had ordained for them to play he blinded them we know where to hang the plan right for them to come in and here here John looks over it's easy sold under the honor and what you see his old souls watch what he calls him they cry Lord how long what just a little longer knee let's get that as we go down they realized that they murdered the Messiah yep they didn't know it but then they realized it now that was some more folks that's right they got they got murdered back to pay for it for doing the wrong and now look what the thing they had to do they would guilty of murder well they got murdered see they cried out his blood be on us yeah that's right and they were blinded and if if they hadn't been blinded God said let them alone look you understand what he's saying man see it's not God saying leave him alone they're not worthy if that's the way he said it he would just wipe them off right right are you reading I mean read what he's just saying but being that they was blinded by God his grace reached down to them amen talk about Amazing Grace and give each one of them a robe because all Israel would be saved everyone that has his name written that's right amen all Israel is to be saved to be brought in let's see going to the next 17. going to eat me and we read that one we read that all through them we'll go by snake and we read it with I guess we didn't I thought I was posted two different sections this is paragraph 269 of the fifth seal now notice though they had tried to get rid of Joseph his grace reached to them and you remember the story how that they tried to kill him you know when they tried next no we won't kill him we'll put him down here and sell it no they tried to get rid of Jesus he still comes right back around because he was blind and gives him each one of what road yep now you remember the statement I gave the other night wrote around and said seeing it like that he said you could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gallon hat I will never touch it yep That's how little it makes yes sir I live blind and give them each one a white robe he's going to take them right on in on anyhow it doesn't make a bit of difference because he done said I'll save them all anyhow I like that much man burst him notice they asked for Revenge see now and if they had been the bride it'd have been like Stephen father for him so his name's proven this is not a born-again Christian it would have to be sold on the all of the Jews you know but these are Jews that's just come in see they asked for Revenge notice again see again he said notice it's not he said it's not brethren the Jews 144 000 you remember until thy Brethren are sealed and they wanted Revenge they said oh we're going to we want you to Revenge us down there that's what they're doing until they get white robes yep once they get the White Road they won't Revenge no more once they get on that Altar and see God we're just reading the quote from above he said yes for a little while now just a little while for a notice let me read it here it's in the 10th verse all right Lord how holy and true of this thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white roads were given to every one of them and it would stay at the age reading the scripture unto them that they should rest yet a little season see watch a little season until their fellow servants see now what it is the prophets now are preaching to Israel our servants also my fellow servant and also got Brethren they should be killed see the ones that's predestinated to be done so you should to be killed as they were should be fulfilled amen see once they're given white robes it's going to be ice with rapture 144 000 is going to get white robes after the Rapture which is eternal life right amen but the two witnesses and all the records you have of a Rapture right he doesn't mention 144 000 going up in a rapture and all the studying I've done I can't find right around saying they go I always believed it did because where else would you put them right that's right amen but maybe a little bit different amen notice again and he said there's nothing he said it's not brother the Jews the hundred now they wanted Revenge they said oh we're going we want you to Revenge us down there he said just go to the wild man just a little while notice let me read it here as soon as Tim's version all right they cried with a loud voice saying how long the Lord only in truth does thou not judging avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest in a little season watch a little season until they're fillers service now what is the prophets now are preaching to Israel amen the prophets are preaching to Israel while he's telling them just hold on just a little while I'm making a way we're here to be real right right right I'm making a way that you can be brought in the bride don't cry for Revenge go to the next one already I got 106. six seal we took that and there's nothing in the world I don't believe but that bunch of of the Jews have went through a pre-tribulation period when during the time of this life's Wars they were they they've got to be hated by everybody nightclub and killed Millions with them in Germany we just read the trial you heard the trial lens of innocent people slang Jews just because they were Jews no other reason the Bible said to hear that they were slain for their testimony of God or the the word of God and the testimony of the hell now we find out that the bride was the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ these had no testimony of Jesus Christ and we find out that the Bible says that all Israel the predestinated Israel will be saved Romans 11 and we know that and there we've seen them Souls all right they're not I'm gonna go ahead and put this quote in here where you can argue because it sounds and this is what I've always stated and don't go ahead to 19. and I've always thought that the souls under the altar in the field sealed you had to go to the white Throne to receive eternal life I always thought that and I had this quote to go with it to see because of this statement it is in the second resurrection that the soldier under the altar is set forth in the fifth seal Revelation 6 9-11 are given Rock robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of light roads we go to the fifth seal and watch and the crime of the loud voice going down to the where he starts his paragraph I don't know now no particular that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not like Antipas who was slain were holding fastest name these are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying out or the engines they cannot be dried material the bride turns the chief and Christ forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing yeah listen let's get to the last one let me get through the millennium is to the Jews right we are there on the honeymoon that's it there is a millennium Temple to be built according to Daniel 70 weeks and he gave Ezekiel 40-44. until time will be built all right and we come back that Temple as I've said is not built as a sacrifice of altars and things it's not there it's a temple because they know who the the lamb is right but it's built there to remind the Israelites and God's promise to them right who would be better to go back and build it than Israel absolutely amen the Millennium is to Israel yep because it's a promise in the Bible to David that his son would sit on his throne Solomon fulfilled the natural Jesus will be the son of David Son of God Son of Man son of David right Jesus will be the son of David in the millennium he was not the son of David so the woman that cried out son of David have mercy on me you didn't answer because he was not in the office of son of David he was in the office of Son of Man all right but when she said Lord he heard her right because he wasn't Lord she had right calling that you see why it would take months to just keep on preaching on it was he in the Millennium he'd be son of David sitting on the throne of David and Israel will be there right the prophet said to 144 000 we'll be there in the millennial reign as eunuchs to the bride we'll get to it later when we cover Dan and Ephraim how they want to take an out put back in what happens well he's bound to be 144 000 plus 24 000. in the Millennium the Jews what would be wrong with that field sealed you come on join up in the millennium that would fulfill all of the scriptures amen absolutely of David and his throne and God's chosen people and they would still be his chosen people but there's a vast difference between chosen people and bride of Christ right of Christ's going to be there on the honeymoon Israel is going to be there at 144 000 this service to the bride somebody's going to build that millennium Temple and there's going to be a millennium right let's go to the 20 number 20. all right I had a museum paragraph 290 of the new seal and they said much why can't we go back to the kingdom right now he said where's that in the Bible not in there right the statement is how long how long right the statement is they're saying how long how long so in brother random translated he said what my why can't we go back to the kingdom right now to his evidence they're going to show itself to him and they're questioning how long why can't we go back to the kingdom right now watch it the Jewish kingdom is to be set on the Earth we are in the kingdom of God spiritual right but the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know John said the kingdom is in heaven to be said and this is the kingdom of the Gospel amen see we're in the Kingdom of the Gospel right but the kingdom of the Jews will be preached by two Prophets yep those two prophets have got a great message to bring right because they're going to tell them we're going into millennium sure we're going to see the Fulfillment no wonder brothers and mothers that's under the altar they feel that pool that's right with the kingdom of the Jews will be preached by these two prophets to notice the kingdom of the earth here the Kingdom of Heaven is preached by the Jews or listen I mean to the Gentile the king of Heaven is preached to the Gentiles right goodbye they came here on Earth is to be set up in the millennium after the Millennium to the Jews they were Dr Storms right and I noticed notice this now here while while they are preaching City before these these prophets ever arise on the scene these Jews that had to die unto item in them each one of them that's predestinated is given on my rope and each one of them is given a light robe assuming that takes place did you read the Bible says Revelation 6 9 of friction 11. until your father brethren and giving white robes and then the 144 000 are going to be killed that's right did you read that there or did you miss it right there in that quote toilet three reasons and I mean to the Gentile the kingdom uh here on the earth is to be set up in the millennium the Millennium is to the Jews correct all right after the Millennium to the Jews now notice this now year while they are preaching who right right who's preaching City before these these prophets ever arise on the scene before the prophets arise on the scene really these Jews that had to die under Eichmann still and then each one of them that's predestinated is given by Grace a white robe to the Thirsty prophet he says they'll get white rose before the 144 thousand get killed all right if they got white roads where you gonna put them what position you gonna put I don't believe you can put them into my Throne nope no ain't gonna put them into my Throne they already got it right right man 144 000 don't go to the white Throne they already got it right the only ones going to watch their own response right because they don't have it they have a confession but not a possession and brother Richard Wilson and I've been talking this morning to quite a bit on this because you that are listening to him you hear him say some things in the last couple of messages not formation where he's covering that you don't believe that the 144 000 will be killed until after the two prophets are killed the two prophets are killed going to Rapture then 144 000 are killed and he said he believed they would step over and God would raise him up in the millennium in glorified bodies I know for sure they're going to be in glorified bodies in the Millennium of that amen yep but you don't have no record of a Rapture for the 144 thousand that's right they gotta go somewhere gotta do something so then I could see I'm not saying that I know it and agree or understand or whatever I'll just say I can see because of what I see right I see the fifth seals you is going to be given eternal life and they're going to recognize Jesus Christ well they're the souls under the altar now how are you going to get them back here to Earth yeah and where are they coming could it be it's 144 000 Plus or 24 000. raised in the Millennium in the glorified bodies and could it be to feel sealed you will also be raised her yep because in the Millennium they will be a gospel to the heater which will be raised from the dead that will not be the fifth sealed Jew no it's a gospel to the Heathen that Heathen will be normal people not Eternal people can't find it nowhere No Redemption for us you got the words of the Prophet that they'll be there you have no records or scriptures and things it's 144 000 will be in the millennium but you got to profit that says it will right when we leave out of here Israel starts getting the message right right yes sir and they started getting that message when they do God's got a work to do I was asked a question said according to what our understanding see Jesus goes with us to the marriage supper who said you guys are saying it's going to be three and a half more years after that Jacob's trouble he said what's Jesus going to be doing he's not going to work yeah sure he crew was crucified his soul went to hell to the Lost you agree you come back up and picked up the Old Testament Saints you agree why couldn't he go to Israel but around said he takes us to the marriage supper and this is where he said and Slips Away comes down here according to Daniel 70 weeks 144 000 don't see Jesus until in the millennium nobody he's not here in Corporal body when he's appearing through the two witnesses all right The Plan of Redemption is unfolding whom God is doing it amen they feel that pool when we go out of here let me quote another one but around said they see that light glorifier the Halo coming after the bride and blankets coming after them it's his words so now you got the feel seals you a place to go you don't put her before they watch your own because she already has eternal life now you can put her in the Millennium and see the dead can be raised and go into the millennium the literal dead people can be raised and put into the Millennium has to be a heater and that the gospel can be preached to we also see that that fair CO2 can be there because it's to Israel and I see it take all these things like I told Brother Richard this morning I said brother and I know he's thinking the same thing whether or not it would be this way or whether or not it would be that way but we see the Plan of Redemption amen at least we're talking about a Redemption okay for everybody else is just Glory Hallelujah how great we are and how we always was eternal and how that we don't need this and we don't need that church we need to ever to have a Redemption we can find amen and that field sealed you I've told you over and over is the greatest example of Grace that could ever be given to any mankind right amen and he would save them right that don't even want to be saved you know that brother around said he heals him Jews every day right now he said they still don't believe him in this as their healer if they're healed they've got to be healed by Jesus Christ right right where are we at so then maybe I was right when I said the first four seals shows the Plan of Redemption right justification sanctification the baptism on the Holy Ghost and the revealed word Bill six and seventh shows how he done it how did he do it justification sanctification the baptism in the Holy Ghost right around said seventh seal continue on with the same simple message or you will work yourself away from the truth that's a paraphrase but it's pretty close but I'd heard and now we have it back there in the office that they were saying now that they had a drawing and they put up that Jesus comes 69 and then preach three and a half years so he'd make 69 nights back there in three and a half over here in Utah and they got their drawing but we are the drawing we're brought around it was verified and proven to be true did he preach you 69 weeks to the cross and one week left at Israel amen right after Rapture in the church amen but you know what you think that's going to change any of those people I asked a brother to personally send a certain brother a copy of the real drawing of the Daniel 70 weeks you think that'll change anything the golf people will say we don't know which one's true the drawing Ain't Gonna Save You when I want to see 69 and a half weeks I want quotes I want scripture I want the Bible any word or the prophet any word to say that no no sir but yet the vast majority of this message believe that come on take on these things The Plan of Redemption we'll get into the souls Under The Altar and cover more about the soul remember more about Eichmann and Hitler and all of that the killing of all of them get under the vanity for him foreign like most people are running out of something to preach I'm just getting to the place I can preach I'm seeing everything just unfolding amen I ain't seen an end to it yet now I won't if it's a plan every day if it ain't I don't mind telling you I was wrong I've never had any trouble saying I used to think it was this because now I think it's that never had any trouble huh I've said it many times what do we got brother 145 in the red book 145 on the red book anybody have a need remember these that are traveling remember Wayne California and
