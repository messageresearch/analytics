[9:13] also I want to brings some things from
[9:17] the country of India to as a report and
[9:21] at the present situation is very bad
[9:24] the country of India we have now I'm not
[9:30] afraid to say the truth you know because
[9:32] it's on the YouTube or Internet you know
[9:34] I don't worry about that you know now I
[9:37] need your special prayers for the
[9:39] country of India now the Hitler's are
[9:43] ruling the country you know what is
[9:47] Hitler means Hitler killed so many
[9:49] millions of innocent Jews you know so
[9:52] Hitler's are ruling our country at
[9:54] present and their worship they believe
[9:59] in 33 millions gods and goddesses and
[10:03] they are trying to wipe out Christianity
[10:06] by 2020 122 you can read you can go in
[10:10] the internet and find out you know they
[10:13] are trying to wipe out Christianity in
[10:15] India by 2021 and 22 which is not
[10:20] possible anyhow so in one of the state
[10:29] our present Prime Minister he appointed
[10:32] his chief minister in India every state
[10:36] we have Chief Minister and governor and
[10:41] the chief minister at present in one of
[10:44] the state called Luther Pradesh and he's
[10:48] from a Hindu temple priest Hindu temple
[10:52] priest and as soon as he got the
[10:54] authority power you know he banned all
[10:57] the slaughtering houses it's a big state
[11:01] you'll find all kind of people there and
[11:05] ebuy he banned all the slaughtering
[11:10] houses no beef no pork no fish no
[11:19] chicken nothing and he want to convert
[11:23] that state there's a vegetarian state
[11:27] which is not possible so he's taking
[11:32] advantage of the power he got
[11:37] just yesterday I received the news you
[11:39] know I have a cell from food from India
[11:42] and I received the news the police there
[11:46] to protect the cow they knocked out the
[11:49] woman and woman is dead
[11:52] believe me to protect the cows C or W
[11:56] cow huh to protect the cow they're
[12:00] knocked out you know the woman and she's
[12:03] dead so that shows there is no value for
[12:06] the human being in the country of India
[12:07] and recently boyers had a special
[12:15] meetings in southern parts in one of the
[12:18] another state and their three brothers
[12:22] came from New Mexico I don't know them
[12:25] personally but they belong together
[12:28] Manuel Salazar's Church for New Mexico
[12:31] and they went to India and the boys had
[12:33] a meetings in one of the place and when
[12:36] the first meeting started the anti
[12:39] Christian organization came and stopped
[12:42] the meetings from 2000 years we have
[12:50] freedom to preach Christ we have freedom
[12:54] to preach the gospel but now they are
[12:57] tired trying to take away from all our
[12:59] rights I don't know what God is going to
[13:03] do about that I believe in God
[13:05] I remember about Phil 25 15 years back
[13:11] or maybe 20 years back I don't remember
[13:15] there was a president of Egypt I forgot
[13:19] his name
[13:20] and he stood one day and he said I am
[13:23] going to wipe out the name of Israel
[13:27] eyes from the map of the world and they
[13:33] they had a war with Israel and and he
[13:36] got defeated and he is dead so I believe
[13:41] the same thing God will do something
[13:44] I believe that praise the name of the
[13:47] Lord because we God had given us this
[13:51] commission to preach the gospel in India
[13:53] promote the message of the hour nobody
[13:56] can take it away no matter our blood
[13:59] drops goes you know they says you
[14:04] worship our God's or leave this country
[14:07] so I don't know but I believe God will
[14:12] do something praise the name of the law
[14:15] so remember there are a lot of
[14:17] Christians persecuted not only in India
[14:21] as well as all over the world so pray
[14:24] for the Christians and now the
[14:29] Christians Lord said if somebody slaps
[14:31] you on one cheek give turn another cheek
[14:33] of course we believe that you know but
[14:37] there are second majority in our country
[14:39] is Islamic people and they're not going
[14:44] to keep quiet you know we are going to
[14:47] retaliate and one day it will become it
[14:51] you know India will become a
[14:52] battleground those three brothers came
[14:56] and by the grace of the Lord they've
[14:58] they returned back safe to New Mexico
[15:01] and praise the name of the Lord for that
[15:04] but you know as far as the situation in
[15:07] the country of India now the white
[15:09] people you know the preachers preaching
[15:12] is not allowed openly you know and it is
[15:15] it is not safe for the white people to
[15:18] come to India but anyhow if you trust in
[15:22] the Lord you're welcome there's the Lord
[15:24] God takes care of you
[15:25] doctor you know God our God is a great
[15:28] God is Jehovah mighty God powerful God
[15:33] King of Kings Lord of lords Almighty is
[15:40] there to protect us praise the name of
[15:43] the Lord hallelujah
[15:44] okay if he says if if my time is come to

[15:50] so praise the name of the lord so i
[15:53] bring special love and greetings from
[15:55] the orphans
[15:58] widows and the lepers because of your
[16:01] loving-kindness because of your prayers
[16:04] you love your burden they are still
[16:06] feeding 400 poor every day is a human
[16:09] being it's not possible but if a car God
[16:12] nothing is impossible
[16:13] he said poor I keep it for me so this is
[16:17] is responsible to feed the poor praise
[16:20] the name of the Lord and I have it
[16:23] adopted feed the poor and give them
[16:27] gospel and I thank God that that's
[16:31] success you know that is giving me
[16:33] success you know in how every here we
[16:36] baptized two hundred three hundred but
[16:37] you know it is going down because we
[16:40] have no freedom to baptize the people we
[16:44] have no freedom to back you know have a
[16:46] special meetings open-air or outside and
[16:51] whatever we do we had we need to do in
[16:53] the church and I don't know one day they
[16:55] will come in and that take over the
[16:57] church you know and that situation is
[17:00] very bad at present anyhow let the name

[38:41] themselves Christians if you love the
[38:44] world or the things of the world the
[38:46] love of God is not even in youth said
[38:49] the scripture when we love the world we
[38:52] are the enemies of God but foot Lord for
[38:57] though the Bible says Lord was a
[39:00] righteous man he got a title Lord was a
[39:04] righteous man what what happen oh my my

[1:01:57] the young Richard ruler came running
[1:02:00] there was some good qualities in him you
[1:02:04] know young Richard ulla first thing you
[1:02:08] know people stay next door but they
[1:02:11] don't want to come to church but this
[1:02:13] man coming running he came running to
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ he came running number two
[1:02:28] he kneeled down in front of Jesus I'm
[1:02:34] closing it now he came and kneeled down
[1:02:38] it's very hard sometimes to deal down
[1:02:41] you know but two great people of God in
[1:02:46] the Old Testament they were kneeling
[1:02:48] down and looking unto God calling upon
[1:02:50] the name of the Lord so that's young
[1:02:52] Mary agree Senora
[1:02:53] Rula he was kneeling down he humbled
[1:02:56] himself humbleness is very important we
[1:03:02] need to become humble we need patience
[1:03:05] Christians in these last days we need
[1:03:08] patience
[1:03:09] we need to humbleness we need to obeyed
