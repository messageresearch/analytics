TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the lord it's good to be back in the house the lord good to have the everybody back brother luis is gone preaching in uh jacksonville i think it is and brother boyd's on vacation so they're the ones that are not with us today so today we're going to continue our little thought on prayer i told you we were just going to pick one word but aaron did a wonderful job it was a miracle he spoke less than 15 minutes so that's okay he's learning so let's get in we're going to pick one word and that's what we're going to continue on and we looked at prayer and now prayer remember is an invocation or an act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication in a narrow sense the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed toward a deity or deified and deified ancestor uh we're not doing that okay that's just a that's just the definition but we are our our prayer remember we were talking about in in the garden before the fall before sin happened there was no prayer there was no such need for prayer god spoke to adam lip to ear personally god god even spoke to cain they didn't have to pray to a god there was no intercessor there there was nothing that that they needed because god was right there with him the whole time but then when sin happened we know that it separated and then now there had to be a rapport as this talks about between an object of worship through deliberate communication so we know as the bride of jesus christ we know who we're praying to amen and as we were covering the other day and we talked about a little bit in the uh bible study last night about a the prayer of a bob-haired woman cannot be heard from god except for her salvation now that's hard to understand but it's in the bible the bible says she dishonored her head if she prays with her head uncovered which would not be a hat on that would mean that she would be cutting her hair now see that wasn't that so you say well what was brother that wasn't brother branham's idea it came from the bible right okay i don't know where people get off that that they won't listen to the to the prophet to god in the end time he's just quoting you the bible right everybody's like get back to the bible get like brother daniel somebody and i've heard him we got to get back to the bible we never left the bible the true bride never left the bible it became more clear when the prophet came on the scene that now i'm not praying to a second person of a trinity i'm praying to my father i'm praying to god almighty i'm not praying through somebody who's praying through somebody and you know what the bible even tells us that jesus christ is our inner is our mediator but remember he's not a second person he's almighty god if you walk into the courtroom of of god almighty you see jesus and then if you look over and see the prosecuting attorney that's the devil but you see the person that's for your defense that's jesus and you look over there in the in the uh witness stand and you look over there in the in the jury box and there's that's jesus so you can't lose folks so that's who we pray to we don't pray to another deity or another deified person like even the the catholic tells us you know we need to pray to this certain saint because he walked 25 miles a day and we need to pray to that saint when we travel there's no such brother brown said that was spiritualism so we know that's not what we're doing as the bride of jesus christ we can go to god you women sisters that don't cut your hair you can go to god for anything you ask for just as good as the man just as good as the men your prayer is heard there's no gender prayer everybody get into all this gender stuff this day and time we are the only people that know who we are who we come where we come from and what we're doing here but let's go to genesis the first time now look in genesis 13 verse 8 just for some of the ones that haven't been here it says abram said unto lot there there be no strife i pray thee now that's not a prayer that's a statement that's a statement that says please or used in in treaty or exhortation so in other words i pray that y'all made it to church today or we actually did pray but it's a statement but the first real prayer we look in genesis 20 verse 7 and it's a prayer that got a man out of trouble right this is abraham praying for abimelech that god wouldn't destroy his country right right now therefore restore the man his wife remember we would think abraham would be in the wrong because he's the one to give his wife away but god said you've got to go listen to my prophet and he's got to pray a prayer for you to jehovah to restore back because look surely thou shalt die that's the first prayer in the bible that abram or abraham was praying to god to entreat or i mean not to entreat but to ask forgiveness from this fellow over here so that is to intercede or to pray when we do this when we pray we are intervening remember the prophet of god and we'll read it a little bit later on the prophet of god tells us that that's the most powerful thing you can't go we couldn't go to zach black two years ago and say zach you got to be saved you got to be saved well it just was like okay that's fine because it happened to me but the prayer that you had in your closet the prayer that bob got on his knees and sister monica and all the different ones were praying for him we were interceding for him amen to jesus christ to save his soul because we can't save him that's why there had to be prayer because here's adam and here's god and when genesis 3 15 he said i'll put enmity or division in other words i can't speak like i want to speak to you anymore but you can pray there's a thing called prayer look in genesis 20 verse 17 this is so abraham prayed unto god and god healed the bible his wife and maidservant and they bear children so abraham prayed to god for this king that was getting ready to make a mistake then also numbers 11 verse 2 the people cried unto moses when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was cri was quenched so here is moses now look you see in the old testament there is a lot of prayer of intercession because there was not a don't get me wrong there was not a jesus christ that they knew they didn't know jesus christ in the old testament he hadn't developed into that yet he was jehovah he was this god you couldn't touch he was just god that you had to go into this building you had to go behind this veil you had to go do this you had to do this you had to do the ten commandments you had to put this on right and you had to be you know you had to have the oil on your head and you had all these do's and don'ts to meet god but now when we get into the new testament we're going to tell you what jesus told how he told us to pray our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread he told us how to pray why because the the intercessor was standing right there in front of them telling them that you pray what i'll send the comforter in my name or in the father's name and you pray not to me that i'll pray to the father no i thought we looked in matthew and we're skipping over real quick to get over there matthew it says that jesus prayed for us to me that's the real lord's prayer for the bride in john 17 when he said lord i pray that they may be one me and them be one as you and i are one well now were they separate people no they were the same that's our problem we think we're inferior to god or we are some second person that's our problem that's why we've been here it's not because of anything else it's just we don't realize who we are that's right that we're not a second person listen if you're like god you're the devil if you're a second person from god you're the devil the brother said there's only two people you've got to worry about god in the devil amen so you know you're either one of the two you're not an in-between in other words the bride is not another person separate from god we got to realize that folks go that's what he said there in john when he was interceding let's turn straight to that if you don't mind we'll we'll get over to john 17 9. everybody wants to know what this great uh this end time is has in store for us you'll have to head on over there pretty good pretty good ways there brother john 17 9 just keep going you good it says i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and then he continues on with thine or mine and mine are thine and that they may be what the same i pray not for the world see we don't we shouldn't pray for the world what are you going to pray for something that's already condemned you can't pray for something sure you can pray for your family and your friends and the people around you and your job and all these different things but forget about praying for who's in the office amen why it's already condemned it can't get any better it can only get worse so in john 17 that whole chapter there jesus is praying for the bride he's praying for me and you he's praying he didn't and he didn't say lord take him out of this world no what'd he say lord they're going to stay in this world but you protect them right now what is our protection jesus christ is our protection because we pray to him we know who to pray to not to a second person of a trinity matthew 21 verse 22 do not go there but it says whatever things you ask in prayer believe you shall receive it believe you shall receive it amen and then the bible tells us when we stand praying forgive have you ever done that before oh it's real easy to pray for somebody you like but what about paying for praying for somebody that almost run you off the road or pray for somebody that's despitefully using you and at work or first one thing in another that's why i said the the brotherly kindness is way up there it's easy to love people that love you but what about love people that hate you and literally pray for them that they'll do good pray for them that they'll do good oh no lord no lord i can't do that they've been mean to me pitiful you you need to go up that statue of perfect manner you need to get the new birth first amen that's what i told them over brother pageants i said look there's a lot of things that we're that we're teaching now not just us and i'm talking about the bride in general that if you don't have the new birth you're not going to understand it you're just not going to understand it i'm sorry but if you'll get the new birth god promised he'd do these things for you but he didn't promise you do you do them for you if you just sit there in in la la land or in sanctification or justification he said he would what he would feed his children not rocks not scorpions he said he would feed them bread he would sustain them through life our problem is there's a lot of people that are not born again they think they are but see that's the age brother russ was uh we were conversing this morning by text and that was his whole thing he he says i almost cry when you look at people that are so they're so caught up in the world not world but i mean caught up in denomination that they think that's right and they're praying straight to the devil because god's not in that folks now he'll save a hungry soul but if that hunger soul gets in your birth he won't stay in that denomination i'll promise you that he won't question the prophet i'll promise you that you might have questions but if you question the prophet you ain't born again if we start right there maybe we'll be all right just the way it is we'll talk about that this afternoon because listen god sent us a messenger and if william branham is not that messenger then you know what if i miss it and i'll go to before the judgment because if i miss it i will go before the judgment i'm going to go to malachi 4 and say look you promised you'd send me elijah and you turned my heart back where was he and where is he you know what he's going to say to them people i sent you william branham wow sorry that's just the way it is look in acts 1 verse 14. these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication i want to ask you a question this morning how many of you have started praying for our meeting in july the success of that meeting will come from your prayer brother brown said the success of his meeting was two women in a in a closet praying that the meeting would go well wow two women yeah they were holy ghost-filled women i'm sure because god heard their prayer amen so you start praying for this thing coming up that will all do the right thing it'll all be done in order and that people will have a good time look in acts 4 verse 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and spake the word of god with boldness let's go to romans 8 verse 26 and likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intersec intercession for us with groanings which not cannot be uttered how many of you have had an unction to pray for somebody how many of you have got up at night and a name come upon you your heart and you just start praying for him and then knowing later on that that person was going through a trial at that very moment why it was god wanted you to pray god wanted you to pray for them they need a prayer you know you've heard dad many times and i tell you when when i used to have migraine headaches i couldn't pray if you ever had a real good migraine you don't do nothing but try to survive you get in the coldest room you can find put something on your eyes and tell everybody leave me alone but i'm dependent on somebody to pray for me that's why we have the prayer list that's why we have the wall downstairs with the people that's why brother terence reads these prayer requests every sunday because it gives you something to pray about gives you something to pray for somebody some brother even somebody you don't even know you know if the if the philippines come on your heart just start praying you don't have to call listen we jesus told us right here somewhere he said don't be in these long prayers i read it to you a while back he said don't be like the pharisees he said you don't have to pray for everything pray for what you specifically need to but oh it's matthew 6 verse 5 when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when you shut the door pray to thy father in secret that's when you have time alone with god that's your prayer life you say well i even met a lady yesterday at the at the yard sale that benefit yard sale that that we were doing for that lady that got hit by a drunk driver but we we got to talking about that she said oh yeah i pray without ceasing she said i pray now i'm praying now something come on the heart she just says lord just be with this person and she was a a nominal christian lady but that's what you should do but when thou prayest enter into that closet shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret now father which seeth thee in secret shall we reward the openly see the two ladies didn't stand up in the meeting and start praying that the whole meeting would know them two women are the ones that made that success of that meeting no they prayed in the closet but it got the attention of god that he had a prophet on the scene that discerned what was going on and come out and told the people then afterwards the success of this meeting was because of those two ladies going into their closet and praying so don't worry your prayer is never going to be unheard right never it'll never go unheard even what the smallest thing that you need so here we go right here in first corinthians let's read this and every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonor with her head for that is even all even all one as if she were shaven that's where brother brown got the quote right there she dishonoreth her head first corinthians 11 13 judge in yourselves is it commonly that a woman pray unto god uncovered first thessalonians 5 16 says rejoice evermore pray without ceasing you say brother wait how you do that listen you don't have to close your eyes to pray that's right the bible says jesus lifted up his eyes toward heaven and started talking to somebody amen so you don't have to and it is honorable to close your eyes when you pray it is honorable to do that but listen when you're going down the road and somebody comes on your heart don't close your eyes you just might have a wreck but you give honor to god and say god i'm doing this because you put it on my heart and i'm praying while i'm driving down the road amen pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus what concerning you first timothy four verse four for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer everybody got that james 5 14 listen to this any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he had committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now listen to this in revelations i'll get a couple quotes here and then we'll be done revelations five verse eight watch what it says here and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having ever one of them harps and golden vials watch full of odors in other words your prayer is never done away with it's banked up somewhere i'm reading the bible golden vowels full of odors which are the prayers of the saints every prayer you pray continues on and continues on and continues on everybody got that amen revelations 5 verse 8 man when he took the book what he took the book in revelation 5 and the golden vial was full of odors then there was something there that there was a prayer of a saint that got you in this building there was a prayer of a saint that got you saved now they didn't save you but that effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much let's look at this brother brown let's read these few quotes and then then we'll close right here brother braham said oh father i pray as your servant the only we realize that prayer changes things prayer changes a sinner to a christian prayer changes a sick man into a well man and i ask in joining prayer with this man that you heal his body may he go off this platform happy rejoicing in jesus name be well amen number 50 the next one 1953 now look what prayer does prayer changed from death to life and god said the man is going to die i believe isaiah told the truth he was born a prophet his words were true and came from god then hezekiah prayer changed the opinion of god now i want to stop right here now listen hold on a minute this same prophet preached a message does god change his mind about his word he does not god cannot change his mind he knew this was going to happen before knowledge therefore he didn't change his mind but there had to be something to teach us a lesson that prayer does change you from a sinner to a saint it does change you from an unhealed person to a healed person somebody that you praying for over here that needs prayer it does change things but it never changes the eternal mind of god you can't change eternity amen nobody got that all right so now let's read it oh i like that prayer changes things it's the most powerful force that god ever put in the hands of man is a sincere prayer offered to god jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that i'll do believe it try it once and see if it isn't true 1961 expectation what man calls great god calls foolish what man calls foolish god calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out after all what god wants us to do and the only way i know is to do it is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer magicians get ready to come prayer will change the mind of god now watch be careful now it did as we see it here but it never changed the mind of god he knew what was going to happen okay they'll be okay with that because you can't make you can't make god change his mind and he can't change his mind because listen as we're talking about the eternal plan of redemption anything eternal cannot be changed you can't eat you can't change the eternal plan of god listen try to go out there like brother brown said go out there tonight and pray until dawn this morning that the sun won't come up but god told us the sun was going to come up in the bible but now he did make provision one day that a man without the holy ghost joshua said god i need a few more hours and he had the son stand still he didn't do away with it he said he just stood still for the 20-something hours so he could finish his battle so god didn't change his mind he knew joshua was going to ask for that right so by foreign knowledge god can't change his mind all right but he did change the mind as we see it because he seen you hezekiah was going to pray but now remember when hezekiah prayed for 15 more years look what he turned out to be he should have went on when god took him said he was going to die the first time because you go into the perfect will of god to the permissive will of god you're walking on dangerous territory perfect will of god is the perfect will of god permissive will of god you can go wrong just like hezekiah did let's read this one last quote prayer isn't a ritual that depends on closing our eyes and putting on holy faces the very last one i want everybody to read just pull it up musicians come on prayer isn't a ritual that depends on closing your eyes and putting on holy faces we don't have to kneel or sit we can pray while walking driving or working god responds to a two-word cry for help in the middle of a busy afternoon just like he does to a focused prayer time after reading scripture in the morning prayer doesn't have to be complicated god delights in any simple word we offer him like i said before the you're not going to pray the sun to go down or say it the way you want it because god's already set it in motion hey man so let's stand to our feet and we'll brother joe come or we're going to play a few moments of of music just to rest for me and you can sit back down if you want to somebody already falling asleep i'm gonna have a hard time this afternoon y'all need to sleep at night
