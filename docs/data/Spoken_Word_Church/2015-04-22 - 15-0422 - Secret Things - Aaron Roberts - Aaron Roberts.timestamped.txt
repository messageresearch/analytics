[4:37] before we go to
[4:39] the word tonight
[4:41] have just
[4:43] I have a couple of prayer requests as a
[4:44] man that I work with
[4:46] things Eddie and uh
[4:49] he's uh had some heart problems and his
[4:53] heart won't stay in having trouble with
[4:55] staying in Rhythm and they've had to
[4:57] shock him and give him medicine and
[4:58] everything like that and uh
[5:00] I talked to him and uh
[5:03] he said it so far it's been staying in
[5:04] Rhythm but he's been nauseated
[5:07] and the doctor didn't want him to come
[5:09] back to work but he but he came back
[5:10] anyway and he's been very weak and but I
[5:14] got talked to him for a little bit and
[5:15] uh he uh he said well I've been quoting
[5:18] never healing scripture in the Bible so
[5:20] so uh but but I told him that no we'd be
[5:24] praying for him tonight amen he said he
[5:26] needs all the all the prayer he can get
[5:29] and and
[5:31] um
[5:32] brother Greg Gadson called me and some
[5:34] of you may not know who brother Greg is
[5:36] some of you made the may know brother
[5:38] Greg he's he he's a precious black
[5:41] brother pastors a little church over in
[5:43] South Carolina I've been to
[5:45] a few times and he called me and uh
[5:49] just got some situations going on he
[5:51] he's requesting prayer and
[5:54] so I told him we'd be certainly be
[5:56] remembering them tonight and the Lord
[5:59] knows Lord knows the situation we don't
[6:01] have to know the situation we just we
[6:03] just believe and bind our faith with
[6:06] theirs
[6:07] but uh he always he always asked me
[6:10] every time he talks to me on the phone
[6:11] he asks me how brother Dale's doing and
[6:13] how the congregation's doing and uh he
[6:16] always tells me he said uh
[6:19] to let you know that he sends his love
[6:22] to all of you amen and so he just wants
[6:25] to greet all of you and just remember
[6:26] they pray for you and they're just a
[6:28] handful of over there but you know they
[6:30] there's precious people we really enjoy
[6:33] going over there and being with them and
[6:35] uh
[6:40] you know it's uh
[6:43] you know just like just like in the
[6:45] scripture where the uh Balaam had the
[6:48] mule talk to him you know
[6:51] I just want to be used of God and and
[6:53] you know brother every time I talk to
[6:55] brother Greg he just so uplifting but
[6:59] um you know he told me he said brother
[7:01] he said you came and preached at the
[7:02] church and he said you didn't even know
[7:04] he said it had to be gone because you
[7:06] didn't know what was going on but he
[7:07] said you couldn't have preached any
[7:08] better
[7:10] sure and you know I just and so you know
[7:13] I'm just so glad that I've been able to
[7:15] be a blessing to him and in some little
[7:17] in some little way that you know
[7:20] just God lay it on your heart for the to
[7:23] say something to somebody to be
[7:25] encouragement or or give an answer or
[7:27] whatever it is that they need because
[7:28] you know that's what brother Brenham
[7:29] said if you had a question on your heart
[7:31] God's obligated to put a man behind a
[7:34] desk and answer the question that you
[7:36] had on your heart
[7:38] he's you know it we're here to
[7:42] be used of God to break the the yoke
[7:45] that Satan had you know he said that he
[7:48] has over your eyes that he's got you
[7:49] blinded so you can see that God can
[7:51] speak to each one of us and you know
[7:54] many times I I feel like I've I get
[7:57] spoken you know I get I get I don't know
[7:59] how well y'all get blessed I get blessed
[8:00] lots of times sometimes up here just and
[8:03] you know it's when you just yield
[8:04] yourself to God and and let him come on
[8:06] the scene and speak so we just want to
[8:09] commit these prayer requests and I know
[8:11] there's other ones and uh y'all just
[8:13] pray for me I
[8:16] it's been over a week now
[8:19] I uh
[8:20] I stepped off a little thing at work
[8:23] slid on a plastic mat
[8:26] and about fell down and caught myself
[8:28] and
[8:29] I uh I knew I knew not to uh play
[8:33] softball that's reason I was trying to
[8:35] play catcher I wasn't trying to hit
[8:36] because I knew I'd mess something up if
[8:38] I did
[8:39] but I had to go to the doctor today and
[8:41] get some of that uh
[8:43] some of that faith building stuff in the
[8:45] pill form today
[8:47] and uh they they think I might have
[8:50] messed up my meniscus in my knee
[8:53] and uh so y'all just pray for me I feel
[8:56] a lot better I started getting on some
[8:57] of that anti-inflammatory medicine and
[8:59] it's went down some but but I tell you
[9:01] y'all just pray for me I
[9:03] if y'all if y'all look at me and I'm
[9:05] hobbling that's the reason that's the
[9:06] reason why I'm trying to stay off as
[9:08] much as possible and the doctor wants
[9:10] wanted me to be out for Thursday and
[9:12] Friday and I told him I said well I may
[9:13] be up tomorrow but I ain't gonna be up
[9:15] the rest of the week but uh I mean it
[9:18] made him go to work tomorrow so
[9:20] Lord touch me I may feel like running
[9:21] running around the building
[9:23] amen so y'all just pray for me tonight
[9:26] we'll just uh bow our heads we'll read
[9:28] uh Deuteronomy chapter 29 and just see
[9:31] what the Lord has for us tonight

[11:08] scripture one little scripture here says
[11:10] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[11:12] Our God but those things which are
[11:14] revealed belong unto us and to our
[11:16] children forever that we may do all the
[11:19] words of this law
[11:20] amen you may be seated God bless you
[11:25] well that's what I want to speak on
[11:27] take a little thought on
[11:29] the secret things of God
[11:32] and
[11:37] you know what
[11:41] I was listening to brother Bob last
[11:42] Wednesday night and he done such a good
[11:44] job and amen
[11:46] amen
[11:48] we had a real we had a real good time
[11:50] when we were in Alabama
[11:52] and uh went to went to the Midnight
[11:54] Church
[11:57] felt like Paul and Silas having church
[12:00] at midnight yeah
[12:04] yeah but uh
[12:07] told Brother Bob that
[12:09] and told some of the other ones said
[12:11] brother Bob he done such a good job but
[12:14] said he felt like I felt like he was
[12:16] like a a jet engine
[12:18] when I'm planes on if you've ever been
[12:20] on a plane flying out of Atlanta when
[12:22] they Roar up those engines
[12:25] and they got the brake on you can just
[12:26] feel that thing rumbling all the way
[12:28] through the through the plane and you
[12:30] just waiting for them to pop that break
[12:31] and that thing to take off
[12:33] well
[12:36] brother Bob he wasn't like he wasn't
[12:37] like brother Jewel
[12:39] taking off
[12:42] you know they say bless it blessed is a
[12:43] man that preaches a a an hour sermon in
[12:46] 15 minutes and preaches a 15-minute
[12:48] sermon in an hour
[12:51] well let me tell you Bob was doing all
[12:53] they could to stay on this side of
[12:54] Eternity I think he was trying to hold
[12:56] back he was doing such a good job I tell
[12:58] you I really enjoyed it and
[13:01] he carried some of that over Wednesday
[13:02] night
[13:04] and I told him
[13:05] you know if you if you can't get excited
[13:08] when when brother Bob preaches you know
[13:10] they just need to take you out and bury
[13:11] you because I think you're dead
[13:14] but brother Bob he done such a good job
[13:16] trying to
[13:18] you know because you only we only spoke
[13:19] for about 15 minutes over to the
[13:21] Guatemalan brothers and
[13:23] and it was it was so it was so good
[13:26] and I appreciate the Lord
[13:29] what he had what he had for us
[13:32] you know
[13:34] it's good to see those that are hungry
[13:37] and thirsting for for God
[13:40] and and you know those
[13:42] Brothers you know they're they're
[13:45] seeking for what they can get and even
[13:46] even though they don't speak the
[13:48] language or don't speak much of the
[13:50] language but you know they're thirsting
[13:52] it and hungry for the word and it was it
[13:55] was really good and I appreciate brother
[13:56] Bob and uh just wanted to just wanted to
[14:00] say that to him kind of embarrassing a
[14:01] little bit because he's back there
[14:02] laughing but yeah man but it was it was
[14:05] it was really good and
[14:07] it's too bad he wasn't taped I tell you
[14:09] he done a good job for 15 minutes so
[14:11] I'll tell you it was
[14:13] but uh brother
[14:15] well Louise can tell you it was good and
[14:17] all the brothers they done they done a
[14:19] real good job but
[14:21] anyway tonight I want to speak on uh the
[14:24] secret things of God
[14:26] and brother Brandon go into uh this is
[14:29] from the 70 weeks of Daniel
[14:32] in this uh quote number one here and the
[14:35] background for this brother random is
[14:37] speaking of the of the earth and he's
[14:39] speaking of the of the condition that he
[14:41] talks about the uh the different
[14:43] calendars and how how the Earth is out
[14:45] of cater and out of balance and you know
[14:48] we can't hold these things in into the
[14:51] time frame that that we look at because
[14:53] uh with the Earth having going through
[14:56] the brother random said through the end
[14:57] of deluvian Destruction the prophetic
[15:00] calendar doesn't match up with our
[15:01] calendar anymore so you can't follow any
[15:03] of these things but uh
[15:07] he said it just only shows that this is
[15:09] just a period of Time Can't You See God
[15:11] don't have things out of cater he's just
[15:14] running he's letting it run like that
[15:16] for a little time and I I truly believe
[15:18] that that thing was done
[15:21] and at this last days is when God is
[15:23] going to reveal these things these
[15:25] secrets to the church he hasn't done it
[15:28] before and the reason he hasn't done it
[15:30] is to keep the Churchill watching and
[15:31] praying all the time not knowing when it
[15:34] was coming but you remember in Daniel 12
[15:36] he said the why shall I understand and
[15:38] and the last days it's been given to him
[15:42] he said the spirit of wisdom comes into
[15:43] the church to make known to the church
[15:45] by the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[15:47] bringing the church in and revealing
[15:49] what day that we're living in just the
[15:51] same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy
[15:54] Spirit comes to the church and the last
[15:56] day to reveal these great deep secret
[15:58] things
[16:00] and so we know that
[16:02] this is our time and God has come to
[16:05] make these things known and
[16:09] um
[16:11] you know some sometimes when I study I
[16:13] just
[16:14] you know I I don't believe you know
[16:16] Brothers say we don't believe in
[16:17] organization so sometimes sometimes
[16:19] that's the way my notes are they don't
[16:20] look like they've been organized but I
[16:22] know where I'm at y'all you know so you
[16:24] know they said they were reading some of
[16:25] my notes I asked them I said well did
[16:27] y'all say Amen
[16:31] well it's not as bad as brother random
[16:33] was talking about you know he drew
[16:35] diagrams and all kinds of stuff nobody
[16:37] understand what he was saying but but uh
[16:41] you know sometimes you just put things
[16:42] together and you don't know which
[16:44] direction you want to go until later and
[16:45] the Lord's trying to shows you things to
[16:47] how to how to go and what you want to
[16:49] say but
[16:50] um
[16:51] so if I bounce all you know if I bounce
[16:53] around I'm gonna work brother I don't
[16:55] know who's in the back tonight
[16:56] brother Joe I don't know
[16:59] somebody's waving back there so anyway
[17:01] Hoover's back there y'all gonna have to
[17:02] work tonight
[17:03] you don't have to earn your pay tonight
[17:06] bless your hearts but anyway
[17:08] um
[17:09] you know the scripture says in in Amos 3
[17:13] 7
[17:14] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[17:16] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[17:18] servants the prophets
[17:20] so you know there was a it was a secret
[17:22] to being made known in and in Revelation
[17:24] 10 7 says but in the days of the voice
[17:26] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[17:27] to sound the mystery of God should be
[17:29] finished as he hath declared to his
[17:31] servants the prophets
[17:33] and you know
[17:34] you know we've been over some of these
[17:37] things before but you know
[17:39] the definition of a mystery because I
[17:42] want to look at things you know because
[17:43] he said the secret things belong to God
[17:45] but he said to things that are revealed
[17:47] belong to us and our children
[17:49] but you know the thing is is if you you
[17:52] know brother Branham says in in Christ
[17:54] the mystery and we'll get into that he
[17:56] said God had a secret he said God's
[17:58] secret mystery
[18:00] you know that he wanted to make be made
[18:01] known
[18:02] and so you know we know those things but
[18:05] a mystery is something that's not is not
[18:08] understood or it's beyond understanding
[18:11] he said a religious truth that that no
[18:15] that one can know only by Revelation and
[18:19] cannot fully understand
[18:21] because you know brother Brown said even
[18:23] through the mystery being revealed
[18:25] there's a secret part that's not
[18:26] revealed
[18:27] and so a secret is is something that's
[18:30] kept from knowledge or view revealed
[18:32] only to the initiated designed to elude
[18:35] observation or detection working with
[18:38] hidden aims or methods and you know
[18:41] that's the reason that in the scripture
[18:42] that Jesus spoke in parables
[18:45] because he said it's given unto you to
[18:47] know the Mysteries
[18:49] but he said unto them it's not known
[18:51] and so he spoke in those and they said
[18:54] Lord explain The Parables to us
[18:57] and so then he goes and explains the
[18:59] Parables but see he spoke to the people
[19:01] so that they would know what he you know
[19:03] the word was made known but the secret
[19:06] of that was made unknown only to the
[19:09] disciples and so there was only a
[19:11] certain group that that was made known
[19:13] to
[19:13] and so you know many times what we look
[19:17] and and we speak of the uh the Mysteries
[19:20] and the secrets being made known but you
[19:23] know it's a secret until there's
[19:25] something that's revealed
[19:27] because you know God brother Adam says
[19:29] that God had had a plan and a purpose
[19:32] that he wanted to be made known and so
[19:34] in in the beginning there was a there
[19:36] was a plan but it was not made known but
[19:39] you know nobody knew that
[19:41] and and even when in the scriptures when
[19:44] he when he started to condescend and
[19:46] everyone brother Brown speaks in
[19:47] Christ's mystery and he speaks of the
[19:49] prophets he said even when the prophets
[19:51] was was making known Jesus Christ but he
[19:53] said it was only a shadow he said it was
[19:55] only them prefiguring Christ but he said
[19:58] that was only that was only being made
[20:00] known but it was still a secret
[20:03] because the plan and purpose that he had
[20:05] was a secret and as he was starting to
[20:07] make these things known then it became a
[20:10] mystery that's the reason that when Amos
[20:12] said surely that God will do nothing but
[20:14] he'll make his Secrets known Into His
[20:16] prophets so it had to unfold unto
[20:19] something so it was a secret that was
[20:21] made known to the prophets so then that
[20:24] became what they done and then when you
[20:26] go back to the uh the fathers the found
[20:29] you know in the beginning you know he
[20:30] said the the Patriarchs you know laid
[20:32] the foundation who talk about Abraham
[20:35] Isaac Jacob and Joseph coming through
[20:38] and laying the foundation he's talking
[20:40] about uh you know laying uh election and
[20:43] then justification Grace and uh
[20:47] Perfection so you know he talks about
[20:49] each one of those things each one of
[20:51] them showing what they came to do and
[20:52] then he said then he said the prophets
[20:54] built the body and so you know they
[20:57] continued on to make known Christ in
[20:59] their own way but it was still hidden
[21:02] all right man and even even from the
[21:05] beginning
[21:06] God even even from the beginning and all
[21:09] that he'd done he he was making himself
[21:12] known even when he started to condescend
[21:14] into the into the son of Unto the Son of
[21:16] God and he started to create
[21:18] you know even all those things that he
[21:20] took that took place that was still him
[21:22] showing himself trying to make himself
[21:24] known in every in every aspect and even
[21:27] even when when Satan was there and Satan
[21:30] knew that uh
[21:32] some of the things but you know he can
[21:34] clearly understand the uh plan of that
[21:37] God had but you know even later on when
[21:39] he tried to get into the Garden of Eden
[21:41] and he tried to mess up the plan of God
[21:44] and corrupt the plan of God even then he
[21:46] couldn't stop it from taking place
[21:47] because that's exactly what God wanted
[21:49] to take place
[21:51] because you know he put man on free more
[21:53] agency that he knew what was going to
[21:54] take place but even when Satan tried to
[21:57] stop it it was working right into say
[21:59] into God's plan that was going to take
[22:01] place and then he stood there and he
[22:04] told he told Satan
[22:06] he said I'll put enmity between your
[22:09] seed and her seed and the seed of the
[22:11] woman so it was already speaking of what
[22:14] was going to take place but that was
[22:15] what his plan was from the beginning and
[22:17] they already had promised prophesied
[22:19] that they would be one that would come
[22:21] and he already had prophesied the
[22:24] destruction because he said he said he
[22:26] will crush your head he said but you'll
[22:28] bruise his heel
[22:30] well because he knew see that that
[22:33] headship was leadership is power but if
[22:35] you crush his head if you take his head
[22:37] out then there's no more power then he
[22:40] becomes powerless but see when he spoke
[22:43] of it stepping bruising his heel see
[22:46] there had to be a uh a Frailty of
[22:48] humanity that that he had to come
[22:50] through because man had to fall the
[22:53] Redemption had to come the same way so
[22:55] when the humanity when when man fell
[22:57] then there had to come one in the
[22:59] likeness of sinful flesh to do the same
[23:01] thing to come back to bring us back so
[23:04] you know because even even when Jesus
[23:06] Christ stepped into Melchizedek and he
[23:08] came and he spoke to Abraham and he
[23:10] prophesied to Abraham and he gave him
[23:12] the promise he still couldn't be the
[23:14] Redeemer even though he was able to meet
[23:16] and work and fellowship with with
[23:19] Abraham he couldn't be the Redeemer
[23:21] until he came through the womb of Mary
[23:23] until he came through that way
[23:26] and when he came that way see then he
[23:29] could overcome but it already been
[23:31] prophesied to do that why would it cause
[23:33] the victory had already been taken place
[23:36] and see Satan didn't see that and no one
[23:39] else saw that but until God came down
[23:41] and started speaking through the
[23:43] prophets then he made that secret known
[23:45] and then it became a mystery
[23:47] right
[23:48] then it was mysterious
[23:51] and then that's the reason in the last
[23:53] day see there's many things that are
[23:55] spoken of in the Bible but there's still
[23:57] a mystery it's still mysterious until
[24:00] there was one that came that's the
[24:02] reason that it said in the last days
[24:04] when the son of man is revealed he
[24:06] wasn't revealed in the scripture
[24:08] he spoke of himself but no one had that
[24:10] revelation
[24:12] there he stood and as as brother Wade
[24:14] was speaking in Mobile and done a
[24:16] fabulous job of speaking on the on the
[24:19] son of man when the son of man would be
[24:20] risen again see he had to come back and
[24:23] he had to be risen again why because
[24:25] they had to crucify him again
[24:29] so there had to be a it had to go
[24:31] through that and it had to fulfill the
[24:33] scriptures
[24:34] amen and that's the reason I'm so
[24:36] thankful one because the more I sing in
[24:37] the Scripture it fits absolutely perfect
[24:39] with the scripture everything that took
[24:42] place
[24:45] you know I I you know I thank God that I
[24:47] say that because you know some people
[24:48] people that say well you know brother
[24:49] Brandon wasn't wasn't Vindicated and he
[24:53] wasn't who he said he was and all these
[24:54] things you know you just got to be blind
[24:56] you just don't have spiritual eyes to
[24:58] see who the prophet is
[25:01] one because it it takes the Assam of the
[25:04] word that comes and anoints your eyes
[25:06] that you can see who you are and you see
[25:08] who he is
[25:11] n't it it's not you know I thank God
[25:14] because it wasn't anything I'd done but
[25:16] it was God's grace to me that I can see
[25:18] these things
[25:21] I thank God
[25:24] that we've been what we've been able to
[25:25] see
[25:29] hey man we're we're a blessed people
[25:34] God is God is so good to us
[25:38] I tell you the more you get into the
[25:40] word
[25:41] the more you see yourself and the more
[25:43] you see you see Christ
[25:46] and you know
[25:48] I don't know about you but you know
[25:50] sometimes you you get like like Bob said
[25:53] you get so full you start leaking
[25:57] but I tell you what I you know because
[25:59] you see it's a love letter
[26:03] and you know brother I said you read
[26:05] between the lines well you know you're
[26:08] not looking at other people you're not
[26:10] looking at other things you're looking
[26:11] at you right and God Brethren said if
[26:15] you don't if you read in the scripture
[26:16] he said if you look in there and he said
[26:17] you don't see Christ in every verse he
[26:19] said go back and read it again
[26:22] because see it all speaks of Christ all
[26:25] the way through
[26:26] and it speaks of you and I
[26:28] he's him speaking to us
[26:32] now
[26:34] what I want to I want to look at tonight
[26:36] and and looking at this in this Secret
[26:40] and these secret things that have been
[26:41] made known
[26:43] I want to look at the life of Elijah
[26:46] and you know because you look at and
[26:50] you know you're certain things that you
[26:52] just stand out to you and and you know I
[26:54] hope I hope you all can see it because
[26:56] it it's just beautiful to me that you
[26:59] see and
[27:01] you know because God spoke through all
[27:03] of these and and Christ was made known
[27:05] in all these and
[27:06] um
[27:08] it was just it's just really beautiful
[27:09] to me but uh I didn't I didn't give them
[27:12] this scripture but uh it's in First
[27:14] Kings 17 and when you when you start to
[27:18] read through the scripture here and uh
[27:20] want to get into a few things and um
[27:23] the first thing is when when Elijah came
[27:28] you know Elijah came and told them
[27:31] because of the wickedness that Israel
[27:33] had done
[27:34] he told them
[27:36] he said because of what you've done
[27:39] he said Dew will not fall he said until
[27:42] I call for it
[27:43] he said he said it'll be a drought he
[27:46] said it's going to be you come into a
[27:48] drought time he said it won't rain or do
[27:50] for
[27:51] for these years until I call for it
[27:53] according to my word and and when you
[27:55] know brother Brown said that that
[27:57] because of what took place when he spoke
[28:00] when Elijah spoke to the people you know
[28:01] it didn't it didn't affect them
[28:04] it fell on deaf ears
[28:06] and when he saw that he was speaking the
[28:08] word into them and trying to bring them
[28:10] back because of what they had done then
[28:13] he told he told Elijah he said I want
[28:15] you to come with me to the brook of
[28:17] cherith
[28:19] he said there's a place I want you to
[28:21] come to that's away from all of them why
[28:23] because they're not going they're not
[28:24] going to listen to you so I've got a
[28:26] place prepared for you and he said he
[28:28] said when this drought started then it
[28:30] all became dry and you know the spamming
[28:33] started and and brother Adam goes on and
[28:35] he speaks of this famine and you know
[28:38] the scripture says that there will come
[28:40] a famine in the last days and brother
[28:42] Brown said you you uh think we have a
[28:45] famine today he said you just wait he
[28:47] said we've not seen a famine yet because
[28:50] there's coming a time where it will be
[28:52] very hard to hear the true word of God
[28:55] and and so when he comes and he brings
[28:57] and he brings the by the the brook of
[29:00] cherith and you know he he brings him
[29:02] out here and out to the Wilderness and
[29:04] he and it just to lay a foundation out
[29:06] you know because you understand when you
[29:08] read this what stood out to me and and
[29:10] reading brother Branham you think of the
[29:12] people
[29:13] that they're all in this in this drought
[29:16] this famine and people are dying and
[29:19] everything is going wrong
[29:21] and you know what he has a prophet that
[29:23] come out there and he told them he said
[29:25] it's not going to rain on my word
[29:29] but you know what not a single person
[29:30] came to Elijah to find out what can we
[29:33] do to change it
[29:35] right amen he said all about crank tell
[29:39] him to go on we don't need him we don't
[29:40] want him
[29:41] say you know what God had a place
[29:43] prepared for him took him off to himself
[29:47] and there he sent by this Brook
[29:49] and while this well this Brook was there
[29:52] you know the the scripture says that he
[29:53] that he had the Ravens came and fed him
[29:57] in the morning and in the evening
[30:00] fed him bread and flesh morning and
[30:03] evening and he sat and drank by the
[30:05] Brook
[30:06] and you know there he was he was in and
[30:08] Elijah was in this in this resting time
[30:10] he was just resting and he was enjoying
[30:14] himself and then in time the scripture
[30:16] says that the that the brook dried up
[30:19] and you know in the in the time when the
[30:21] brook dried up God told Elijah he said
[30:24] now he said I've got a place prepared
[30:26] for you
[30:27] he said now you've sat beside this Brook
[30:29] and he said now he said I've got a place
[30:31] I want to bring you to
[30:33] he said there's a widow woman I want you
[30:35] to go and see
[30:38] and when he comes to when he goes to the
[30:40] to the widow woman
[30:44] so here uh let me read this real quick
[30:47] this is from the message Jezebel
[30:49] religion
[30:52] and
[30:54] this number two brothers he said he said
[30:59] what did Elijah do he said I found he
[31:01] found a Hidden Spring Way up in the
[31:03] mountain where he got some Water of Life
[31:05] Divine Revelations from God as he said
[31:07] up there under the power of God the
[31:09] revelations being a little Hidden Spring
[31:11] while the rest of them were famishing
[31:14] he said God bless his servants some
[31:16] Ravens they brought him something to eat
[31:18] while he was isolated from the people
[31:19] and they were down there famishing for
[31:21] Revival and everything he said don't
[31:24] hear no more of his revivals at where's
[31:26] that old Crank that goes around blasting
[31:28] our organizations where is he at now
[31:29] they don't know God pulled himself he
[31:32] pulled himself with God an isolated
[31:34] place where they didn't hear his voice
[31:36] and then they began to see
[31:40] and he says God sent forth a message to
[31:43] tell the people and they don't receive
[31:45] it then he withdraws his servant and he
[31:47] sends plagues Fame and death spiritual
[31:48] spiritually sleek and physically also
[31:50] you watch for a depression brother you
[31:52] think you've seen something you just
[31:54] wait for a while you haven't seen
[31:56] nothing you think you're dying for a
[31:58] good spiritual Revival you wait till
[32:00] after a bit you just wait long and cry
[32:02] to hear the word of God the Bible said
[32:04] so there'll be a famine in the last days
[32:06] of the prophet and not for bread or
[32:08] water alone but for hearing the true
[32:10] word of God but that voice will be quiet
[32:12] in the wilderness somewhere head away
[32:14] said he ordained the Ravens his servants
[32:17] bless them Birds his servants that kept
[32:20] the voice of Elijah during the time of
[32:22] his isolation from the church the Ravens
[32:24] brought in flesh and bread at mourning
[32:25] and fresh flesh and bread in the evening
[32:29] and he drank from that little fountain
[32:31] where the rest of them down there we're
[32:34] doing without any spiritual food and
[32:36] water right
[32:38] so
[32:39] and then he goes on to speak about uh
[32:42] Jezebel how Jezebel took away everything
[32:48] and they were under such a such a
[32:50] bondage
[32:51] but Elijah had a place of rest
[32:54] and he was supernaturally fed during
[32:57] that time
[32:58] and then we go on and he talks about you
[33:01] know at a secret place ordained for him
[33:04] that he was that God provided a place
[33:06] for him said he would none of this would
[33:09] run out
[33:10] but uh
[33:12] continuing on
[33:14] when God brought brought him to this
[33:16] place and had had all these things for
[33:19] him that he was able to to rest and got
[33:22] a supernaturally fed him these things
[33:24] and then when he set up while he was
[33:26] setting up there
[33:27] and the world was in this famine
[33:31] and everything's falling apart
[33:34] you know the the thing that really
[33:37] stands out to me was you know here's
[33:39] here's Elijah going through this
[33:41] Supernatural feeding and this in this
[33:43] resting time and yet you go and read and
[33:47] this little widow woman
[33:49] brother Brandon the scripture tells us
[33:51] that he said that uh he prepared her and
[33:55] he commanded her to feed him
[33:57] that there would be a time that he would
[33:59] that she would feed him and you know
[34:01] brother Brandon goes on to tell us that
[34:03] you know here she is sitting beside the
[34:05] uh
[34:06] you know watching everything dry up
[34:09] and watching watching the the meal
[34:11] disappear
[34:14] and all around her all she sees is death
[34:16] and brother Branham also goes on to tell
[34:18] us that you know how she had had prayed
[34:21] all night night after night after night
[34:23] trying to seek God because she saw what
[34:26] her situation was and and everything is
[34:28] going down and going away and she's
[34:30] praying to to God for for an answer
[34:35] but you know what he was waiting for her
[34:37] to get to the place that that she was
[34:39] ready
[34:40] and he also says that she had a husband
[34:43] that died in this famine he said he said
[34:47] when she lost her headship
[34:49] and brother Brian goes on to say there's
[34:51] organized religion but when she lost her
[34:53] headship he said then she was ready to
[34:55] hear the prophet
[34:57] when she lost all of that then she was
[34:59] ready to hear the prophet and she got to
[35:01] the point where you know she she had
[35:03] nothing and and but you know there was
[35:06] there was Elijah coming out to her
[35:09] and you know she had nothing and she
[35:11] would just had that little bit and was
[35:13] getting those sticks
[35:14] she's gonna build her little fire and
[35:16] and cook her her little bit yeah
[35:20] and then you know Elijah says
[35:23] you're you're just just amazing you know
[35:25] that that he comes up to this one with a
[35:27] woman and you know it's a famine all
[35:29] throughout the land nobody has anything
[35:33] and you know you imagine that nobody has
[35:36] nobody has nothing but he comes and asks
[35:38] for the most most precious thing that
[35:40] there is from any of them
[35:43] exactly he said give me a little give me
[35:45] a drink of water
[35:49] you know I'm sure that went for a lot of
[35:51] money back then
[35:54] when you were when you're doing without
[35:55] water you just about give up anything
[35:57] you own
[35:58] and so here they here's here they are
[36:01] going through this this time but
[36:03] he says can you give me a give me a
[36:05] drink of water
[36:08] and and she said well you know we just
[36:09] have have very little
[36:12] and then when she goes to get him a
[36:14] drink of water and he says oh can you
[36:16] make me a little make me a little cake
[36:17] first
[36:20] it's like what this man comes in and now
[36:23] he's wanting everything I've got
[36:25] he's coming he's coming to get my take
[36:27] my water and now he's trying to take all
[36:29] the all the food that we have and she
[36:31] says well sir we only have just a little
[36:33] bit
[36:34] and we're just coming and you know I'm
[36:36] just preparing to die
[36:38] I'm gonna make I'm gonna just take these
[36:40] two little sticks I'm gonna build a fire
[36:42] we're gonna cook this little bit that we
[36:43] have and then we're just gonna die
[36:46] and then you know Elijah told her said
[36:50] you know he said make me that little
[36:51] cooked cake first but he said he said by
[36:54] the word of the Lord he said he said the
[36:57] the meal a barrel will never run empty
[36:59] and he said the crews of oil will never
[37:00] run dry
[37:02] and then she went and and done that
[37:04] little bit that that she had and she
[37:06] gave it unto him
[37:08] and you know there was a they went
[37:10] through this little time of eating just
[37:12] this little bit
[37:13] but you know after that then there was
[37:15] there was no time that she ever went to
[37:17] that Mill Barrel that she ever was empty
[37:20] and The Crucible never went dry and here
[37:23] she was going and and the prophet said
[37:26] that you know Elijah stayed with him
[37:28] with her and fed him all the way through
[37:31] this time
[37:32] and here come this time where they were
[37:34] just continuing to eat off all of this
[37:36] one and she gave of the of her lack of
[37:40] her need and that's what she gave of and
[37:43] brother Brown said you know God doesn't
[37:45] want what what you have a lot of he
[37:48] wants you to get what you have a little
[37:49] bit of he said he said you know we
[37:52] thought we think we're so inadequate but
[37:53] that's what God wants he wants you to
[37:56] give of what you have what little bit it
[37:58] is and if you give that then God can
[38:00] bless you right
[38:02] and so you know she gave her that little
[38:04] bit
[38:10] and it's so amazing that
[38:12] here she is
[38:14] famine all the way around her no no
[38:17] doubt there was people everywhere
[38:20] you know no doubt that was people
[38:21] everywhere that you know I you know
[38:23] because when you get hungry and when you
[38:25] get thirsty you know what you're going
[38:27] to go out and you're going to start
[38:27] looking for it
[38:29] you're gonna start looking everywhere
[38:31] you can find it
[38:34] and it's so amazing that nobody ever
[38:36] found out that this woman had all this
[38:37] food
[38:41] oh
[38:42] see they were eating and Elijah was
[38:45] eating with her and you know what nobody
[38:47] ever come by is knocking on hey can we
[38:50] help can we get some of that
[38:54] you know just like just like the Queen
[38:55] of Sheba you know traveling through the
[38:58] desert
[39:00] you know she was she was more desirous
[39:02] to find a Solomon and see see the work
[39:05] of God through Solomon that she was
[39:07] about the robbers
[39:10] and you know they were all throughout
[39:11] the desert
[39:13] and no doubt every night that she was in
[39:15] the desert she was you know she that she
[39:17] was running a risk of being killed or
[39:21] being robbed
[39:22] but you know what she had more of a
[39:24] desire to see Solomon than to go through
[39:27] because all of that was inconsequential
[39:30] well because she had a hunger but you
[39:33] know it's so amazing that they they were
[39:35] there and able to eat
[39:37] one because there was something that God
[39:39] had done for them and it was a secret to
[39:41] everybody else everybody else is in the
[39:43] midst of this of this famine and
[39:46] everybody's searching and dying and
[39:48] guess what this woman is eating inside
[39:49] of her house and she's full
[39:53] and in the midst in the midst of of all
[39:56] of this famine in the middle of the
[39:57] Wilderness Elijah is sitting up there
[40:00] and he's communing with God and the
[40:02] Ravens are feeding him and there he is
[40:05] being blessed of God and everybody else
[40:06] is searching for it and it's just being
[40:08] brought to him he didn't even have to do
[40:10] anything it just came to him
[40:15] it's such a beautiful thing
[40:19] and you know what we have we have been
[40:21] given this
[40:22] spiritual spiritual food in due season
[40:25] here it's been given to us it's been
[40:27] laid before us
[40:30] but you know the thing is is and we've
[40:32] got to come to do we really hunger for
[40:34] it and when we actually take part of it
[40:41] I'm so I'm so thankful that what we what
[40:43] we have in this hour
[40:47] and we see that you know as as these
[40:49] take place
[40:51] and and here they here they are they go
[40:52] through this this famine
[40:55] and God is blessing them and give them
[40:57] what they have need of
[41:00] and here she is
[41:03] and it was so amazing
[41:06] this this whole Countryside is is full
[41:08] of people that are that are starving
[41:13] and guess what he finds one Widow
[41:17] he finds this one woman
[41:21] and he comes to her
[41:25] and just just like the the at the pool
[41:28] of Bethesda
[41:30] you know the sick and the lame and the
[41:33] halt there's there's a multitude of
[41:34] people around the pool waiting for the
[41:36] angel to come
[41:39] and here's the one here's the I am that
[41:41] came and created all the angels and he
[41:43] comes and stands before this man and he
[41:45] keeps going there 38 years he stood at
[41:47] the pool trying to get in and Jesus
[41:50] stands there and says well thou be made
[41:52] whole he said Lord I try to get in I try
[41:55] to get in I try to get in
[41:58] one because but he had Faith he never
[42:01] left that pool he was waiting for the
[42:03] troubling of the waters and there he was
[42:05] the one that created the angel that came
[42:08] and stood upon the waters and spoke to
[42:10] him and said take up your bed and walk
[42:12] one because he had faith
[42:17] this one here's a here's this little
[42:19] Woody woman and you know it's not
[42:21] anything that we do why because but it's
[42:23] God's grace to us that God has come and
[42:26] spoke to us and showed us who we are
[42:32] thank you
[42:34] you know as far as as far as human
[42:37] abilities or the things that we would do
[42:39] in this life
[42:41] you know I would I would hate to have to
[42:43] think that I would have to build a a
[42:46] resume as it were you know and stack up
[42:49] against people of the world
[42:53] for God's grace God's mercy to us
[42:59] why because you can always find better
[43:01] people in the world
[43:03] but God chose us
[43:07] it was God's grace to us
[43:10] Glory
[43:12] that God gave us something that he
[43:14] didn't give the others
[43:16] and there's nothing that we've done in
[43:17] ourselves
[43:19] God gave it to us
[43:22] and you know we can't we continue on in
[43:24] this scripture
[43:25] and you know we
[43:27] see
[43:29] Elijah
[43:31] and he's
[43:32] and he's there and
[43:34] and the barrel never runs out and and
[43:37] you know the
[43:38] the little boy gets sick and dies and
[43:40] you know because it was just the widow
[43:42] woman and her son and
[43:44] and you know and then God raises her
[43:46] raises him up and and you know he he
[43:48] continues on through this time and
[43:51] and then and then later on you know uh
[43:55] Elijah
[43:56] goes out and he uh
[43:59] is uh continuing on
[44:03] and and God calls him away from the
[44:05] widow woman
[44:07] and then later on he's out in out in the
[44:09] wilderness and
[44:11] you know all the all the things that
[44:13] that he came through and
[44:15] um
[44:17] you know he comes and he challenges uh
[44:20] Ahab
[44:21] you know because Ahab is destroying
[44:24] Israel and bringing Israel down and you
[44:27] know he come out to rebuke Ahab and and
[44:29] all the things that took place and you
[44:30] know he continues and then he has to go
[44:32] and and deal with uh the prophets of
[44:35] baalem on uh Mount Carmel and you know
[44:38] he just continues on and you know God's
[44:40] taking care of him all through this and
[44:42] and then later on after this you know he
[44:45] leaves
[44:46] and you know he kind of gets run down
[44:48] later on in the story if you read and
[44:51] then you know he comes to a time where
[44:52] he's out by himself and and you know
[44:54] brother talks about how how he's kind of
[44:56] run down and he you know he thinks he's
[44:59] alone and you know he gets into this
[45:01] this period of time where he just sort
[45:03] of moping and you know uh kind of been
[45:05] off to himself and God comes and and
[45:07] sends an angel to him
[45:10] and you know it was in the in this time
[45:12] where he was so low you know he sends an
[45:14] Angel and the angel wakes him up and and
[45:16] and tells him says you know you need to
[45:19] eat
[45:20] and gives it gives him the the bread and
[45:22] the water and he and he eats and he
[45:24] drinks and he goes back to sleep and
[45:25] brother I said an hour or two later the
[45:27] angel wakes him up again and comes to
[45:29] him and says here eat a rise and eat and
[45:32] so he comes and he eats again and the
[45:34] scripture says that he that he went 40
[45:36] days and and the meat that the angel had
[45:39] fed him he went 40 days in that and you
[45:42] know it's a it's amazing that God comes
[45:45] and gives him what he had need of and
[45:47] even when he was and he thought he was
[45:48] so low and you know it started out in
[45:51] the beginning and it was just it was
[45:52] just the Ravens feeding him and then it
[45:55] was a woman feeding them but when it
[45:57] came to the end then it was an angel the
[45:59] Lord coming and feeding him and giving
[46:01] what he had need of but he gave him what
[46:03] he had need of for the journey and when
[46:05] he was going forth in the in the journey
[46:07] you know he he went from there after
[46:08] after that time then he uh met God in
[46:11] the and the and he was in the cave you
[46:14] know he was hiding from God and God came
[46:16] to him and
[46:18] you know said what is thou doing here
[46:21] Elijah
[46:23] because you know he thought he was all
[46:24] by himself
[46:25] and you know God God told him said no he
[46:28] said you're not you're not by yourself
[46:29] right and you know when you come out
[46:32] there and and God said I want to speak
[46:34] to you and told him to come out to the
[46:35] to the mouth of the cave there and he
[46:37] said I want to speak to you and he come
[46:39] out there and then you know he said he
[46:41] said the wind blew and he said he knew
[46:43] God wasn't in the wind and he said you
[46:45] know an earthquake happened and he said
[46:47] he knew God wasn't in that earthquake he
[46:49] said then he saw a fire and he said he
[46:51] knew he knew God wasn't in that fire but
[46:53] he said when the still Small Voice came
[46:55] by then he wrapped his face and
[46:57] everything and he come out and spoke to
[46:59] God and God God spoke to him and told
[47:01] him he said Elijah he said I want you to
[47:03] know something he said you're not by
[47:04] yourself
[47:07] just to pass on another point before I
[47:10] forget uh you know I was reading and you
[47:12] know hey the scripture tells us that
[47:14] that Elijah went to the went to Horeb
[47:17] and it if you if you don't know if you
[47:19] if you study Mal uh Horeb is is also
[47:22] known as Mount Sinai
[47:25] you know Mount Sinai was where where God
[47:28] gave opposes the Ten Commandments
[47:30] brought him up on the mountain and gave
[47:31] gave him the the word and you know told
[47:34] him the the things and made himself
[47:35] known unto Moses and he done the same
[47:38] thing we're here with Elijah and he
[47:39] brings him up on the mountain and he
[47:41] tells him he said listen he said you're
[47:43] not alone
[47:44] he said there are seven thousand that
[47:46] have not bowed their knee to Baal he
[47:48] said they kissed him but he said I want
[47:50] you to know something he said I've got
[47:52] something for you to do
[47:53] he said he said I want you to do
[47:55] something
[47:56] he said when you leave here he said you
[47:59] go down
[48:00] and he said you find
[48:02] uh
[48:03] Isaiah
[48:04] and I think he was supposed to be
[48:06] anointed king over Judah and then Jay
[48:08] Hugh was supposed to be the anointed
[48:10] king over Israel and they told him he
[48:12] said then you he said then you'll find
[48:13] Elisha he said you'll know in Elisha and
[48:16] he said he'll be prophet in thy room
[48:18] because he was already laying up the
[48:20] next next Prophet you know was calling
[48:23] him up but uh you know he went he went
[48:25] forth to do those things in the
[48:27] scriptures tells him says uh
[48:30] he said the ones the ones that bypass
[48:32] hasiel said that that jehugh will slay
[48:35] and he said those that passed jehu
[48:37] Elisha will slay and so he come to find
[48:39] out you know that and all of this he
[48:42] wasn't by himself but God had had a word
[48:44] for him to do and as he went along God
[48:47] was opening things up to him and it was
[48:49] continually to feed him
[48:51] and it was and and all of these type
[48:54] things because it was secret it was
[48:56] something special to Elijah that God was
[48:58] showing him something that he was giving
[49:00] him what he had need of that he could
[49:02] walk in this journey and then when he
[49:04] walked in that for 40 days he he had
[49:07] nothing but that bread and that water
[49:10] and it was so amazing that God had
[49:12] brought him through all this and gave
[49:14] him that little bit and so you know and
[49:16] the way we are today God has given us
[49:18] these little this little bit
[49:22] and it's a it's just you know it's a
[49:24] little bit here and a little bit there
[49:26] but it's what God has given us that
[49:29] little bit
[49:31] and you know it's so amazing that what
[49:33] God has given us in this day you know it
[49:35] takes God to open these things up to us
[49:37] if it's not God you know because you can
[49:40] look at many things but it takes God and
[49:43] And he as the scripture says the secret
[49:46] things so they're secret things that are
[49:49] made known and you know brother Branham
[49:51] goes on to talk about uh in in the
[49:54] scripture
[49:54] and later on he uh
[49:57] he talks about the uh silence in heaven
[50:00] right
[50:02] hey you know because he said because it
[50:04] was a secret thing that was being made
[50:05] known he said that's the reason there
[50:07] was silence in heaven
[50:10] but God was making these things known
[50:13] and
[50:14] you know we we see how God has had came
[50:17] to make these things known and you know
[50:20] there was a few things that just kind of
[50:22] stood out to me and and one of them was
[50:24] uh
[50:25] I was listening to brother Brandon the
[50:27] other night and
[50:29] you know he was uh
[50:32] speaking of brother Bosworth and brother
[50:34] Bosworth was
[50:36] wanting to answer Dr Bass you know Dr
[50:39] Bess was the one that was against the
[50:41] Divine Healing and was told it was
[50:43] telling them that you know you know this
[50:45] is all just a bunch of baloney and you
[50:48] know there's no scriptural thing and you
[50:51] know they won't debate us because you
[50:53] know they they know it's not scriptural
[50:55] and they got nothing no place to stand
[50:57] and you know it's it's these little
[50:59] things that just stand out to you and
[51:01] you're you know brother Brandon wouldn't
[51:03] let brother Bosworth uh argue with him
[51:08] but he said you know I promise I'm not
[51:09] going to argue with him but he said I
[51:10] want to answer
[51:12] you know brother Brian said that it was
[51:13] like Caleb going up there to take his
[51:15] Mountain he wanted to answer what he had
[51:17] to say and
[51:19] you know when he walked on that platform
[51:20] that night
[51:22] and it was it's such an amazing thing
[51:23] you know he walked up there and he asked
[51:25] Dr best he said Dr best let me ask you
[51:27] one question
[51:30] he said well and and he said just answer
[51:32] this one question he said if you answer
[51:34] this one he said I can sit down
[51:36] and Dr Bay said I'm not going to answer
[51:38] it you know he said just go and do your
[51:39] thing and that was when he walked up
[51:41] there and he asked him he said was the
[51:43] Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to
[51:46] Jesus Christ yes or no
[51:48] and it struck me brother Branham said he
[51:50] said I never even thought of that
[51:54] he said that was something I never
[51:55] thought of until Kayla until he got up
[51:57] and you know brother Bosworth said that
[51:59] and you know somebody that Caleb taking
[52:02] that mountain he said man that just
[52:03] struck me that he's like man he said
[52:05] he's got him right there
[52:10] and you know he said because you know he
[52:12] said unless you he said I never thought
[52:14] unless you see it that way and so you
[52:16] know and and then the the other story
[52:18] that that comes to mind when when
[52:20] brother Brown was speaking of that and
[52:22] have you see things and God's speaking
[52:25] to you and breaking things down was uh
[52:28] when he was squirrel hunting and he went
[52:30] to go see the Infidel and he was up
[52:32] there speaking to the Infidel that time
[52:34] and you know the Infidel was uh talking
[52:36] about you know he said I've never seen
[52:37] God he said there's no such thing as God
[52:40] he said I've been on this mountain 40
[52:41] years you know raise up on the hill
[52:43] there all this stuff and he said never
[52:44] seen God nobody's ever proved me of God
[52:46] he said y'all a bunch of lying dogs and
[52:48] you know all that kind of stuff
[52:50] everything that he said about brother
[52:51] Branham and uh preachers and everything
[52:52] like that
[52:54] you know brother Ram got up there picked
[52:55] that Apple up was talking to him
[52:58] he said boy it's a good apple yeah he
[53:00] planted I planted that tree and got to
[53:02] talking to him about nature
[53:05] and he told him he said he said now what
[53:08] is it he said this tree's losing his
[53:10] sleeves he said we've had his cold snap
[53:12] or nothing he said it's August I mean or
[53:14] September you know he's not gotten cold
[53:15] he said why are they leaving this loose
[53:17] leaves he said oh well that's nature
[53:20] why why is nature causing this to take
[53:22] place and there's no need I mean there's
[53:24] no reason for it to take place well
[53:26] that's just nature
[53:29] what is causing that what is something
[53:32] is governing that life in that tree
[53:36] you know brother Brown said it had to be
[53:38] something that was guiding it because he
[53:40] you know because he asked him said why
[53:41] is that he said well he'd kill the tree
[53:43] if it didn't go down in The Roots
[53:45] and then he said he'd come back he said
[53:46] well good he said we can just take a
[53:48] bucket of water put on this pole out
[53:49] here this Vince posted all the water
[53:52] will run down to the bottom of it next
[53:53] spring it'll come back to the top he
[53:55] said well no there's no life in that
[53:57] so there has to be something there that
[54:00] governs that
[54:01] there has to be a principle there has to
[54:03] be a law of God for that to work
[54:06] and he told that he told that Infidel he
[54:08] said he said if you can answer me what
[54:11] life what intelligence told that water
[54:13] to go that life to go down in the root
[54:15] of that tree and come back the next week
[54:17] or the next year he said I'll tell you
[54:20] the same intelligence that told me that
[54:22] that woman that was up on the hill that
[54:23] was dying with cancer that if she'd
[54:25] believe the Commandments of God she'd be
[54:27] healed
[54:29] and Infidel he said he said I never
[54:32] thought of it like that
[54:34] why because he had heard so much and he
[54:37] had seen something but something had to
[54:39] strike him that his side could say
[54:41] something and when he saw it he said I
[54:43] never saw it like that right
[54:46] and when he saw that he said unto that
[54:48] apple tree he said I led him to Christ
[54:51] what was it because when you see
[54:53] something see it it takes the things the
[54:55] secret things belong to God but the
[54:57] things that are revealed belong to you
[54:59] and I and see that's what he's working
[55:01] at through these things that he is
[55:03] trying to break it down to you and I can
[55:05] see them you see everybody don't see
[55:07] everything the same way but you know
[55:09] what we'll see the same Revelation but
[55:11] he has to reach each one of us
[55:13] individually because there are certain
[55:14] things that I see that you won't see the
[55:16] same way
[55:18] right
[55:20] you know I
[55:22] I don't know I've probably told this
[55:24] story before and
[55:26] you know somebody some of you this this
[55:27] won't mean anything but it meant
[55:29] something to me
[55:30] all right listen I listened to professor
[55:32] at mathematics one time give a lecture
[55:34] on number Theory
[55:38] and I've already lost some of you right
[55:39] there
[55:42] but anyway he was speaking a number of
[55:44] sets and how numbers you know he said
[55:46] there was only one he said take the
[55:48] number six he said there's only one
[55:49] number six but he said you can put that
[55:51] number six in all kind of different
[55:52] subsets because it still is number six
[55:55] he said you don't ever change it he said
[55:57] you can put in anything you want to it
[55:59] works out he said you can actually
[56:00] change it to other things but it never
[56:02] changes what it is
[56:04] you can write it as 12 you know 12 over
[56:06] 2 or whatever you know the square root
[56:08] of 36 however you want to write it
[56:11] denoted it's still the same number
[56:13] and when he got done with that I want to
[56:15] jump up and say why don't y'all see one
[56:17] God
[56:22] I was like y'all can't say that
[56:25] I mean he he was he was always God all
[56:28] he done was change his form he became he
[56:30] was still God he was he was Elohim in
[56:32] the beginning and all he done was change
[56:33] his mask he became the he he changed to
[56:37] become the son but that didn't change
[56:40] who he was he manifested himself in a
[56:42] different way
[56:44] I want to get up and run the owls yeah
[56:47] oh praise the Lord y'all can't see that
[56:51] but I know most of y'all probably would
[56:53] have sat there and y'all would have
[56:54] probably just zoned down it's like uh
[56:56] but it struck me I was like my goodness
[56:59] I mean it was almost like Rapture I was
[57:01] like wow that's great
[57:03] but you know what it would have meant no
[57:05] it may not have meant anything else to
[57:06] y'all but it spoke to me why because God
[57:09] speaks and he said he said the
[57:11] numerology of the Bible numeratics of
[57:13] the Bible are perfect and everything
[57:15] that God does in the creation everything
[57:18] is perfect it all speaks of God
[57:22] it's just beautiful
[57:26] that God made these things known to us
[57:28] that he has revealed himself
[57:32] so I just want to read a few quotes here
[57:35] and then I'm gonna
[57:36] I'm gonna quit
[57:39] I didn't have a whole lot tonight but
[57:45] you know sometimes you don't know which
[57:47] way you want to go but you know what you
[57:49] want to say
[57:52] now this is from this is from so I'm
[57:54] going to read this few quotes here but
[57:56] uh this is from the world's falling
[57:57] apart
[57:59] it's number 14 Brothers
[58:01] and he says
[58:03] there's only one thing that that never
[58:05] did begin that was God therefore the
[58:07] only way we can live Eternal is to have
[58:10] God's own life in us and that's eternal
[58:13] life
[58:14] you say God is the word in the beginning
[58:16] was the word words with God and the Word
[58:19] was God it's still God that's right it's
[58:21] still it is the word and when we get
[58:23] away from the word they're away from God
[58:25] Jesus said if you abide in me he said
[58:27] there's the mystery there's the secret
[58:29] if you abide in me and my word in you
[58:31] then ask what you will see the idea is
[58:34] first God's word has got to abide here
[58:38] you can't take creaturisms or anything
[58:40] so forth
[58:42] amen so
[58:46] and then we're going on to
[58:48] number 15.
[58:51] I think this was ill
[58:53] yeah
[58:54] see here it is so God's secret mystery
[58:56] he had before the world began now back
[58:58] in the back part of God's mind there was
[59:00] something that he was trying and going
[59:02] to achieve and he had a motive in doing
[59:04] it in order to let himself be expressed
[59:06] because first there wasn't even a Moon
[59:08] Star at a molecule or anything he was
[59:11] God and he wasn't
[59:14] he wasn't he exactly wasn't God at that
[59:16] time because God is an object to worship
[59:18] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[59:20] so in his great mind he wanted these
[59:21] attributes to be expressed and him was
[59:23] love and him to be father and him was to
[59:25] be son and him was to be Savior and him
[59:28] was to be healer and all these great
[59:29] attributes that we see already expressed
[59:32] they were in God
[59:34] and just scrolling up so I just got
[59:36] different ones here to read
[59:38] he said God's great mystery say Sorry
[59:41] God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery
[59:43] and that's what I want to speak on to
[59:45] the church this morning the hidden
[59:47] Mystery of God that he had in his mind
[59:49] before the world ever began and how that
[59:51] it unfolded itself right down to this
[59:53] present hour that we're living see then
[59:56] you will understand clearly then you see
[59:59] oh
[1:00:00] I believe what is being done that God's
[1:00:03] great mystery of hell it's a secret he
[1:00:05] can't put a secret nobody know nothing
[1:00:07] about it even angels didn't understand
[1:00:08] it see he didn't reveal it that's the
[1:00:10] reason under the seventh mystery when
[1:00:12] the seventh seal was open there was
[1:00:14] silence right
[1:00:16] then he continues on notice God has had
[1:00:19] a three-fold purpose in this great
[1:00:20] mystery secret God in his great mystery
[1:00:23] secret that he had before the world
[1:00:25] began
[1:00:26] he had a three-fold purpose in it
[1:00:31] and he said what we want to go on this
[1:00:32] morning to see what the threefold
[1:00:33] purpose
[1:00:34] and then continuing on
[1:00:36] 29 there says Heavenly places oh I wish
[1:00:40] I had time here I've got it marked
[1:00:43] here in my Bible about Heavenly places
[1:00:45] what is Heavenly places just for a
[1:00:47] moment it's a believer's position in
[1:00:49] Christ where the police are where the
[1:00:51] believer stands in Christ in Heavenly
[1:00:52] places according to as he hath chosen us
[1:00:55] listen close chosen Us in him before the
[1:00:58] foundation of the world when did he
[1:01:00] choose us before the foundation of the
[1:01:01] world when his great hidden Mystery his
[1:01:04] great secret he chose us in Christ
[1:01:06] before the foundation of the world and
[1:01:08] then continuing on he says
[1:01:10] predestination he said there's the
[1:01:12] mystery before Christ or anything else
[1:01:15] was ever on Earth you see this great
[1:01:17] mystery that he chose the bride knowing
[1:01:19] evil would fall from disbelieving the
[1:01:20] word knowing that she would fall but he
[1:01:23] would choose a bride that would not fall
[1:01:25] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:01:27] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:01:29] say about it they would hold to that
[1:01:31] word they were predestinated to stand
[1:01:33] there the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ
[1:01:36] predestinated the church to that great
[1:01:39] glorious stand and then continuing on he
[1:01:42] says now you see the secret what to to
[1:01:44] restore Fallen Eve she was a free figure
[1:01:47] of the church
[1:01:48] and now notice as God opened up the side
[1:01:51] of Adam and took out Eve out of his own
[1:01:53] flesh and blood and divided his spirit
[1:01:55] with from masculine defendant
[1:01:57] to feminish and put it in eve took the
[1:01:59] rib from under his side and made Eve out
[1:02:01] of it so God did the same thing taking
[1:02:03] out of the sight of Christ the blood and
[1:02:05] the water and Christ is the Lord and
[1:02:07] taking the word and making up his church
[1:02:09] Eve see back to himself again Redeemed
[1:02:12] by the blood that was come from his body
[1:02:15] you see now God's great mystery being
[1:02:17] unfolded that's been hid since the
[1:02:19] foundation of the world but prefigured
[1:02:20] and all the way down through
[1:02:26] and he continues on says all those
[1:02:29] things typed him see just in type but
[1:02:31] yet the mystery was he had
[1:02:33] right then man didn't know what they
[1:02:35] were doing the only thing was that they
[1:02:37] were led by the spirit to do something
[1:02:38] now holding it back in the last days for
[1:02:40] the great Revelation but expressing it
[1:02:42] expressed himself to Moses and David and
[1:02:45] Joseph and Elijah on down through you
[1:02:47] see each one of them prophets and bring
[1:02:49] their live out and show it expressed
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never
[1:02:56] giving his secret in full waiting for it
[1:02:58] to be made known in the last days as he
[1:03:00] promised waiting it waiting for it to be
[1:03:03] fully comprehended before he could
[1:03:05] express it and if he told the the whole
[1:03:08] thing before the Bible is written in
[1:03:10] mystery Jesus thanked the father for see
[1:03:12] it was written in Mysteries
[1:03:14] and then you just come on down and he
[1:03:16] says scroll down a little bit there
[1:03:18] brother
[1:03:19] didn't come back in the last days to
[1:03:21] pick up these Mysteries and clearly
[1:03:23] explain it reveal see why it's all the
[1:03:25] last days when this great mystery that
[1:03:27] God had in his heart is being revealed
[1:03:31] amen and then I have just one more quote

[1:04:41] different Promises of God he says if you
