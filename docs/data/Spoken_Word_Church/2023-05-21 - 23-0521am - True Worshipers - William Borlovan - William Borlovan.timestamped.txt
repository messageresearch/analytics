[43:27] let's read in Saint John chapter 4 verse
[43:28] 7. there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[43:32] draw water Jesus saith unto her give me
[43:35] to drink his disciples were gone away
[43:37] into the city to buy meat then saith the
[43:40] woman of Samaria unto him how is it that
[43:43] thou being a Jew ask a drink of me which
[43:46] I am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[43:48] have no dealings with the Samaritans
[43:50] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[43:53] knew was the gift of God and who it is
[43:56] that saith to thee give me to drink thou
[43:58] wouldest have asked of him and we he
[44:00] would have given the Living Water the
[44:02] woman saith unto him sir thou has
[44:04] nothing to draw with and the well is
[44:06] deep from whence then hast thou that
[44:09] Living Water
[44:10] are thou greater than our father Jacob
[44:12] which gave us the whale and drank
[44:14] thereof himself and his children and his
[44:16] cattle Jesus answered and said unto her
[44:19] whoso drinketh of this water shall
[44:21] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[44:23] the water that I shall give him
[44:26] shall never thirst but the water that I
[44:29] shall give him shall be in him a well of
[44:32] water springing up into everlasting life
[44:34] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[44:38] this water that I thirst not neither
[44:40] come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her
[44:42] go call thy husband and come hither
[44:46] the woman answered and said I have no
[44:48] husband Jesus said unto her thou as well
[44:50] said I have no husband for thou has had
[44:52] five and he whom thou now has is not thy
[44:56] husband now note here she had five
[45:00] she had five in the past she was with
[45:02] one now
[45:04] and Jesus was the seventh
[45:07] Jesus was the seventh and he was her
[45:09] completeness
[45:10] that's it
[45:12] in that said is thou truly the woman
[45:14] saith unto him sir I perceive that thou
[45:17] art a prophet our fathers worshiped in
[45:19] this mountain and ye say that in
[45:21] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[45:22] worship Jesus saith unto her woman
[45:24] believe me the hour cometh we shall
[45:26] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[45:28] Jerusalem worship the father
[45:30] ye worship ye know now what we know what
[45:33] we worship for salvation is of the Jews
[45:35] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[45:40] true worshipers shall worship the father
[45:42] in spirit
[45:45] and which is a conjunction in truth so
[45:49] you need both Amen to be a true
[45:51] worshiper you need both spirit and Truth
[45:54] for the father seeketh such to worship
[45:58] Him
[45:59] God is a spirit and they that worship
[46:01] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[46:07] truth amen let's bow our heads before we
[46:09] are seated the gracious Heavenly Father
[46:11] how we thank you Lord Jesus for this
[46:13] opportunity Lord to come and look into
[46:14] your word the very eternal life Lord
[46:16] there's many things we could be doing
[46:18] but father we're happy to be in the
[46:19] house of the Lord there's nothing else
[46:21] that we would rather be doing than to
[46:23] come in your presence because Lord all
[46:25] the Natural Things of life that pull on
[46:26] us each and every day they're so
[46:28] temporal but Lord the things that we're
[46:30] dealing with now are of Eternal value we
[46:32] ask that you forgive us of our sins may
[46:35] you father move me out of the way use me
[46:37] Father the Lord as your microphone use
[46:39] your people father as hearers May the
[46:41] word go forth in Fertile ground may
[46:42] bring forth fruit for your kingdom we
[46:45] love you we give you all the praise
[46:45] honor and Glory we ask that you please
[46:47] be with all the sick and needy be with
[46:49] every request we pray in Jesus Christ's
[46:51] name we pray amen amen you may be seated
[46:53] in the presence of the Lord
[46:56] my wife and I were recently kind of
[46:57] going through the church age book
[46:59] together and we were reading this and it
[47:00] kind of just stuck out to us there in
[47:02] verse 23 where Jesus speaking
[47:05] said about the hour cometh and now is
[47:07] when true worshipers shall worship the
[47:08] father in spirit and in truth and Jesus
[47:10] said for the father
[47:12] seeketh such to worship him I've read
[47:15] this text many times and this is a very
[47:17] familiar text to each and every one of
[47:18] us the prophet took it many times before
[47:20] the prayer lines were come in but I
[47:21] thought it was astounding that Jesus
[47:23] said that the father
[47:25] the heavenly father is actually seeking
[47:28] people to worship Him in spirit and in
[47:32] truth we live in a day where where God
[47:34] in other words God is looking for true
[47:36] worshipers we're looking in in a day
[47:38] that's what's going on in the Middle
[47:39] East is you have the Palestinians and
[47:41] the Jews and the each it's all about
[47:43] worship the Jews want to see the temple
[47:45] you know go back up again so they can
[47:47] worship God according to the Old
[47:49] Testament and they have their own ideas
[47:50] on that and they see what Solomon had
[47:52] and they're trying to recreate it but
[47:54] the Palestinians or the Muslims want to
[47:57] keep the mosque of Omar there so is all
[47:59] the contention and all that hate Sinners
[48:01] all around worship what they think the
[48:03] worship should be in Psalm 29 2 the
[48:06] David speaking says give unto the Lord
[48:10] the glory due unto his name Worship the
[48:14] Lord in Beauty and Holiness the Lord is
[48:17] worthy of worship and that's my title
[48:19] this morning is true worshipers we don't
[48:22] want to just be worshipers because
[48:24] there's worshipers all across the world
[48:26] in their respective areas and time zones
[48:28] and things worshiping God but we don't
[48:30] want to just be worshipers we want to be
[48:32] true worshipers now worship and many
[48:35] times you know when you hear Worship the
[48:36] Lord many things can come to mind and
[48:39] many times speaking in tongues and
[48:41] dancing and shouting all that comes to
[48:43] mind and that is worship but it's not
[48:45] that's not all that worship is a lot of
[48:47] times worship is your Amen to the word
[48:49] you're worshiping God you go to work or
[48:52] you you go home and he said God touch me
[48:54] those brother Ryan testified on how
[48:56] somebody got touched and got healed of a
[48:58] stomach issue while the word was going
[48:59] forth or in church on Wednesday
[49:01] what was he doing he was worshiping the
[49:04] Lord he didn't have to shout it he
[49:06] didn't have to dance it but he yet he
[49:08] was worshiping the Lord by the testimony
[49:10] there's many ways to Worship the Lord
[49:12] sometimes you're pulling on the gift of
[49:14] God and worship the spirit of God comes
[49:16] down on you and you bow your head and
[49:18] you're worshiping the God and nobody
[49:20] knows it but you and God and yet the
[49:23] blessing of God the very the very Pillar
[49:25] of Fire could be hanging right over you
[49:27] ministering to you delivering you
[49:30] healing you but nobody knows it but you
[49:32] and God because you got your head bowed
[49:34] and your worship
[49:36] you're worshiping God so there's power
[49:39] and there's freedom and there's release
[49:41] and worship because God made us to
[49:44] worship because you know understand this
[49:46] as a prophet taught us the angels of
[49:48] heaven as powerful as they are they
[49:50] cannot worship God like you can
[49:54] he tells us that whenever we get on the
[49:56] other side and we're all singing Amazing
[49:58] Grace How Sweet the Sound the very
[50:00] angels of heaven with all the power
[50:02] brother Wade had brought out they never
[50:04] called for reinforcements them powerful
[50:06] angels will be circling the earth with
[50:08] their heads bowed
[50:10] because they in in reverence because
[50:13] they don't understand your song of
[50:16] Amazing Grace
[50:18] they don't understand that despite all
[50:22] the mistakes you make
[50:23] despite all your failures God still
[50:26] loves you
[50:30] despite what a stinker you are he still
[50:33] redeems you
[50:34] and you responded to that call so you've
[50:38] experienced Redemption
[50:41] so you can sing Amazing Grace like the
[50:44] angels of God cannot sing the very angel
[50:46] that Gabriel that appeared to Mary does
[50:49] not know Amazing Grace
[50:52] like you know it this morning brother
[50:54] Louise
[50:56] never lost he never experienced he uh
[50:58] the only thing see worship is a choice
[51:02] we can come to church and we can refuse
[51:04] to worship if we want but there's
[51:07] something when there's something truly
[51:08] on the inside I believe with all my
[51:10] heart that expression is a that worship
[51:13] is a side effect of the Holy Ghost
[51:16] because when the Holy Ghost is in there
[51:18] it can't help but verse forth brother
[51:19] Bob it can't help it the trees when the
[51:23] wind blows which is the type of the
[51:24] spirit the trees clap their hands and
[51:27] they blow and their Seasons as the
[51:30] flowers come up they don't have a choice
[51:32] God set that law in motion and it begins
[51:35] to happen but yet we as free moral ages
[51:37] we sit we're Souls we're redeemed and
[51:40] the Satan can come and make you in such
[51:42] a bad mood you know and if we don't come
[51:44] if you come to church in a bad mood
[51:46] you're in the right spot let's get rid
[51:47] of it
[51:48] because the Satan can come and Crown you
[51:51] with the bad spirit and you come in
[51:52] church in the very presence of God but
[51:55] we sit on our hands all right
[51:57] so we have a choice I don't feel like
[52:00] worshiping we'll worship anyway I make
[52:03] the choice to worship regardless of how
[52:07] I feel regardless of of maybe you know
[52:10] maybe I had a little tip with my spouse
[52:11] this morning on the way to church or
[52:13] maybe whatever happened I choose to
[52:16] worship
[52:17] and that is when God accepts your
[52:20] worship because again God set the laws
[52:23] of CR of creation and things in motion
[52:25] and they do it because of the law of God
[52:27] the son has no choice but to come up
[52:29] every morning
[52:30] but yet you made a conscience choice to
[52:34] come to church this morning
[52:36] you said I'm going to church
[52:40] and you're worshiping the Lord before he
[52:42] even got to church you're worshiping the
[52:44] Lord we should start getting our minds
[52:46] on the word getting our mind on the Lord
[52:48] that is why we should be in the world
[52:50] throughout the week
[52:51] not just from service to service because
[52:53] then we come to service and then God by
[52:55] the Holy Ghost will actually be in
[52:58] you'll feel like he was in your living
[52:59] room you talk about the Lord you read a
[53:02] text you have Bible devotions and the
[53:04] spirit confirms it
[53:06] in church and that is God's confirmation
[53:09] that he was behind that he dropped that
[53:11] in your heart God Amen so worship isn't
[53:14] about feeling like it it comes from
[53:16] within and remember we must have both
[53:18] the mechanics and the Dynamics
[53:22] there's people there's people in
[53:23] denominational churches that the the
[53:25] real we've been taught this the real
[53:27] genuine Holy Spirit falls down and
[53:30] they're giving worship to God and
[53:32] they're praising God if you were in
[53:33] there you could feel the Holy Ghost
[53:36] but they major on that or then after
[53:39] that the preacher gets up and preaches
[53:40] about a trinity or preaches about
[53:42] Luther's message or preaches some word
[53:44] of a day gone by
[53:47] you see they have the Dynamics and they
[53:50] can have healing and manifestations and
[53:52] speaking in tongues and they'd be right
[53:53] they have the Dynamics but they don't
[53:55] have the mechanics
[53:56] and if we're not careful we God has
[53:58] given us this message which is the
[54:00] mechanics the open book and if we're not
[54:02] careful we just come and not and then we
[54:04] we just it's just about the mechanics
[54:06] and we don't loosen up and allow the
[54:08] Dynamics to flow and make it a reality
[54:10] to us
[54:12] a reality to where the word that you
[54:15] hear preached then goes out there you
[54:18] water it with your praise and remember
[54:20] worship and when you read the scripture
[54:22] the order of it is that worship always
[54:25] went before the battle
[54:27] and it was to give the Army behind them
[54:30] they'd carry the ark the word went first
[54:33] and they would praise and they would
[54:34] worship and it was to give the troops
[54:36] behind them the courage
[54:39] to fight
[54:41] and here you can come and you can feel
[54:43] pretty good you come you feel the
[54:45] movement of the spirit you clap your
[54:46] hands maybe maybe a tear run down your
[54:49] eye down your cheek but then you go out
[54:50] in the world and you have to be you have
[54:52] to fight Devils but see here you worship
[54:55] God and and the worship doesn't stop
[54:57] when you leave here but years where you
[54:59] get the encouragement and you get the
[55:01] strength to go out and fight the
[55:03] greatest battle ever fought
[55:05] so the prophet teaches us that the
[55:08] mechanics and Dynamics like having money
[55:10] in the banks but not knowing how to
[55:11] write a check or writing a check but not
[55:13] having them knowing how to write a check
[55:14] and not having the money in the bank but
[55:16] the bride has got both
[55:19] the bride has that beautiful car that
[55:22] beautiful Cadillac all studded and and
[55:24] it's wiped down and clean but she's also
[55:26] got the gasoline in the tank and she
[55:29] knows how to move
[55:31] she knows how to move in the spirit
[55:34] the bride knows how to worship and she
[55:37] knows why she's worshiping because
[55:39] that's important too it's important to
[55:41] know why you're worshiping
[55:44] so if you can't find a reason to shout
[55:47] and praise the Lord and Worship the Lord
[55:48] then you need some Holy Ghost reign in
[55:50] your life
[55:51] we go through seasons and sometimes we
[55:53] can go through a period of drought where
[55:54] we just come to church even and we just
[55:56] can't feel the spirit maybe we feel like
[55:58] we can't get our prayers answered maybe
[55:59] we feel like your prayers ain't even
[56:01] getting over this ceiling but that
[56:03] doesn't mean we should stop
[56:07] but that means we need Holy Ghost Train
[56:09] within the stickiness of our carnal
[56:12] nature can unroll and it's actually a
[56:14] leaf
[56:15] but it takes the rain that is why
[56:18] there's some stickers in the desert
[56:20] because they don't get rain and they
[56:21] curl up and they have a sticky nature
[56:25] and people we can get a sticky nature
[56:27] when we don't allow the the reign of the
[56:30] spirit to fall and let our leaves open
[56:32] that's right and maybe give a little
[56:34] shade for somebody
[56:36] because we know that
[56:38] eternal life is living for others
[56:42] eternal life is not selfish
[56:44] the very Fountain of eternal life Jesus
[56:46] Christ himself lived only for others
[56:49] never himself
[56:50] he looked around in nature and he said
[56:52] he see you know you see birds going in
[56:54] their nest and you see foxes hiding
[56:56] their dance and he said the birds have
[56:57] nests the foxes have dens but the son of
[57:00] man don't even have a place to lay his
[57:02] head he didn't even have a place to call
[57:03] home
[57:04] right
[57:06] there's not a single homeless person in
[57:08] this church
[57:12] now the word worship because remember
[57:14] worship is in the soul of a man
[57:16] everybody worships just because your
[57:18] friends May hate Church they're oh
[57:20] they're still worshiping
[57:23] but they could be worshiping a sports
[57:25] star they could be worshiping a movie
[57:26] star they could they could be worshiping
[57:28] money anything right
[57:30] so the word worship is a feeling or
[57:32] expression of reverence and adoration
[57:34] for a deity
[57:36] the worship of God another definition is
[57:39] to treat someone or something with a
[57:41] reverence and adoration that's
[57:43] appropriate to a deity so something that
[57:46] belongs to God but you give it to
[57:47] something else you're worshiping it you
[57:50] don't have to pray to it you don't have
[57:51] to lay pressure you don't have to pay
[57:52] tithes to it
[57:54] yet if we're not careful because
[57:55] remember the prophet taught us anything
[57:58] between us and God is an idol
[58:03] and an idol was tied to worship
[58:06] now let now let's think of how powerful
[58:09] worship is
[58:11] in the beginning aren't you thankful for
[58:13] a prophet that could take you by the way
[58:15] but even before the beginning before he
[58:17] he'd make a statement before God was God
[58:20] who can say that who can say before God
[58:24] was even God but before God was even God
[58:26] he said he was Elohim he was
[58:28] self-existent we can't wrap our minds
[58:31] around that
[58:32] we can't imagine it but I want us to
[58:35] notice because the prophet teaches us
[58:36] that the very first thing that God
[58:38] created was cherubims and angels and
[58:41] they begin to what worship Elohim
[58:45] so brother Bob worship is so powerful
[58:49] that it transitioned God as we call him
[58:52] to go from Elohim
[58:55] to God
[58:57] he didn't change in who he was he didn't
[58:59] change his power what changed worship
[59:03] when the angels and the cherubims begin
[59:05] to worship him he then was he didn't
[59:08] transition from Elohim to God because
[59:12] God is an object of worship and there
[59:15] was something there to worship Him
[59:16] Brothers said there was nothing there to
[59:18] worship him he was self-existent he was
[59:20] by himself
[59:22] but when they begin to worship him he
[59:25] then became God
[59:27] because there was something there to
[59:29] worship Him
[59:30] now let's expose the enemy a little bit
[59:32] before we go on because the enemy hates
[59:35] to be exposed so let's expose the enemy
[59:38] now before time because we know that
[59:42] time started When sin started so before
[59:45] Garden of Eden let's say
[59:47] because even during the Garden of Eden
[59:48] they were in a sense of Eternity until
[59:50] sin entered in before this time
[59:53] there was a conflict because remember
[59:55] where did the war start it started in
[59:58] heaven not on the earth and there was a
[1:00:00] conflict between God and Satan brother
[1:00:02] man preaches that sermon the conflict
[1:00:04] between God and Satan and that conflict
[1:00:06] and that war started in heaven
[1:00:10] what was the conflict over
[1:00:13] worship
[1:00:16] Lucifer was God's right-hand man brother
[1:00:20] Ram says the right-hand man of almighty
[1:00:22] God was Lucifer think about that he was
[1:00:24] his right-hand man all the archangels
[1:00:26] all the angels all the cherubims Lucifer
[1:00:29] was his his angel
[1:00:31] his right hand
[1:00:32] angel that he would depend on to lead
[1:00:35] the worship in heaven
[1:00:37] Heaven is a wonderful place angels are
[1:00:40] LED in worship and they Worship the Lord
[1:00:41] it's wonderful
[1:00:43] so here you had Lucifer that was a
[1:00:46] worship leader he was brother and said
[1:00:48] he was the right hand of almighty God
[1:00:49] was Lucifer the son of the morning
[1:00:52] the first God granted him almost
[1:00:55] co-workers with him think about that
[1:00:57] almost co-workers with him
[1:00:59] right he was a co-worker partly equal
[1:01:01] with him only Satan could not create so
[1:01:04] so so Satan so Lucifer at that time
[1:01:07] before he became Satan was a very
[1:01:09] powerful Angel the Bible tells us how he
[1:01:12] can transform himself as an angel of
[1:01:13] life he was a very powerful Angel but he
[1:01:16] wasn't he could not create and no doubt
[1:01:20] in heaven brother Bob was was teaching
[1:01:22] this morning on the on jealousy between
[1:01:24] Cain and Abel and no doubt as as Lucifer
[1:01:27] as as he was leading in worship and all
[1:01:29] the angels and he himself was worshiping
[1:01:31] God no doubt there came a moment in his
[1:01:34] heart where he began to say I want this
[1:01:37] worship
[1:01:39] why is all this worship going to him
[1:01:43] so Satan begin to desire and lust for
[1:01:48] worship and he began as a worship leader
[1:01:51] in heaven think about this
[1:01:52] it's not even fathomable but he began to
[1:01:55] get jealous of God
[1:01:56] he began to get jealous that God was
[1:01:59] getting all the worship and he wanted
[1:02:00] the worship
[1:02:02] so his plan from the very beginning was
[1:02:05] to get worship and get it away from God
[1:02:08] now notice in Isaiah 14
[1:02:10] the mind of God through the prophet
[1:02:12] picks up runs all the way before time
[1:02:14] and he says how art thou fallen from
[1:02:17] Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how
[1:02:19] art thou cut down from the ground which
[1:02:21] did weaken the Nations for thou has said
[1:02:24] in thine heart here the spirit of God is
[1:02:26] going right into the heart of Lucifer
[1:02:29] of what Lucifer was saying in his heart
[1:02:32] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[1:02:35] my throne above the stars of God I will
[1:02:38] sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:02:40] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:02:42] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:02:44] clouds I will be like the most high
[1:02:48] but yet look at God bring him down to
[1:02:50] reality in verse 15. yet thou shall be
[1:02:54] brought down to Hell
[1:02:55] to the sides of the pit that they that
[1:02:59] see thee narrowly that they see
[1:03:03] excuse me they that see thee shall
[1:03:05] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:03:07] thee saying is this the man that made
[1:03:10] the Earth to tremble that did Shake
[1:03:11] kingdoms
[1:03:13] yeah
[1:03:14] Satan is just a flick
[1:03:17] that's right remember in the scriptures
[1:03:18] whenever that that Jesus gives a parable
[1:03:20] about the great Shepherd how how brother
[1:03:22] him dramatizes how he gets the the lost
[1:03:24] sheep and he puts him over the shoulders
[1:03:26] and he carries him back that's the
[1:03:28] strongest part of a man
[1:03:30] but yet when he casts out a devil he did
[1:03:32] it with the finger yeah
[1:03:34] Satan is nobody
[1:03:36] he likes to make us think that he's like
[1:03:38] he's some big bad and and you know and
[1:03:40] he's terrible and we can't fight him
[1:03:42] within ourselves but through the blood
[1:03:44] of Jesus he's conquered he's defeated
[1:03:47] and the only weapon he's got against us
[1:03:50] is a bluff if he can get you to believe
[1:03:53] it he's got you
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:03:56] hi buddy amen amen so see if God can
[1:03:59] only he's there was her brother and say
[1:04:01] just the other day he said all the power
[1:04:04] of God is only limited by your faith all
[1:04:07] the power that's it
[1:04:09] so Satan is nothing but a bluff he's
[1:04:12] defeated
[1:04:13] but if he can get you to think that he's
[1:04:16] not defeated and that he does and he can
[1:04:18] do this that or the other
[1:04:20] then he's got something on him
[1:04:22] all right amen okay now he says but he
[1:04:25] was the devil was kicked out of heaven
[1:04:26] and the Very purpose that he tried a
[1:04:28] purpose in heaven he came right down
[1:04:30] here on Earth and is trying his best to
[1:04:33] fulfill any purpose so as brother Bob
[1:04:35] again was teaching this morning Satan
[1:04:37] got jealous in heaven and he got kicked
[1:04:40] down he got into the serpent deceived
[1:04:42] Eve got into Cain
[1:04:44] and he immediately see the same jealousy
[1:04:47] in Cain at the altar of worship just
[1:04:50] like he's seen in his daddy Lucifer in
[1:04:52] heaven it was a reflection from back in
[1:04:55] eternity now it's injected into time
[1:05:00] same devil same jealous devil what is it
[1:05:05] Desiring worship
[1:05:07] that's what that's why Abel Abel was not
[1:05:09] killed because he worked harder than
[1:05:11] Abel or I'm sorry Abel was not killed
[1:05:13] because he worked harder than Kane
[1:05:14] because he had more money than Kane it
[1:05:16] was over worship because his Revelation
[1:05:19] and approach to God that's what cost
[1:05:22] Abel his life
[1:05:24] amen now throughout the entire Old
[1:05:25] Testament we're still exposing the enemy
[1:05:27] here he was always tripping up Israel
[1:05:29] Over worship
[1:05:31] they came through the Red Sea they just
[1:05:33] seen them ten plagues on Egypt deliver
[1:05:35] with a mighty hand Moses goes up in the
[1:05:38] mountain to receive the word of the Lord
[1:05:39] 40 days they can't even stay pure
[1:05:41] they've already a molten calf already
[1:05:43] worshiped worship worship
[1:05:45] who inspired them to do that the devil
[1:05:47] why because he knew that he could get
[1:05:50] God angry you see he knows that God is
[1:05:53] subject to his own words so if he can
[1:05:54] get God angry then God has got to be
[1:05:56] subject to his own word
[1:05:58] and it angered God so Satan got in there
[1:06:01] and had them make this golden calf and
[1:06:03] say this is actually what brought you
[1:06:05] out of Egypt
[1:06:09] through Balaam he did the same thing
[1:06:12] God required Israel to go up to
[1:06:15] Jerusalem and worship to bring their
[1:06:17] Passover
[1:06:18] in the Old Testament in first king 12
[1:06:20] you have two kings one was I believe
[1:06:22] Solomon Sonia jeroboam and he had
[1:06:25] another one rare bone I believe if I'm
[1:06:27] pronouncing that right but there were
[1:06:28] both Kings they were both fighting for
[1:06:30] the throne
[1:06:31] so jeroboam he looked and he was wanting
[1:06:34] the throne and he said you know if all
[1:06:36] these people start going up to Jerusalem
[1:06:38] to worship like God said
[1:06:40] their heart is going to be turned to my
[1:06:43] enemy
[1:06:44] and they're going to make him King so
[1:06:46] I've got to do something here
[1:06:48] so the Satan inspired him to actually
[1:06:51] build up idols and altars so that on the
[1:06:56] way to Jerusalem
[1:06:58] he can trip them up and have them
[1:06:59] worship there
[1:07:01] to keep the Israel from crowning his
[1:07:04] enemy King well Rita and jeroboam built
[1:07:06] shechem and Mount Ephraim and dwelt
[1:07:08] there first Kings 12 25.
[1:07:10] and went out from Vince embed and built
[1:07:13] pineal and jeroboam said in his heart
[1:07:15] now shall the kingdom return to the
[1:07:17] House of David if this people go up to
[1:07:19] do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
[1:07:21] Jerusalem then shall the heart of this
[1:07:23] people turn again unto their lord even
[1:07:25] into revoam king of Judah and they shall
[1:07:28] kill me and go again to rehoboam King of
[1:07:30] Judah whereupon the king took counsel
[1:07:33] and made two calves of gold see it was a
[1:07:35] weakness in Israel
[1:07:37] it was the same thing of what their
[1:07:39] fathers fell
[1:07:40] and Mount Sinai right there
[1:07:45] and okay so he sent me two calves of
[1:07:47] gold and said unto them is it too much
[1:07:49] for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy
[1:07:51] Gods o Israel which has brought the up
[1:07:53] out of the land of Egypt and he said the
[1:07:56] one in Bethel and the other put he in
[1:07:57] damn
[1:07:59] Satan will try and do the same thing in
[1:08:01] your life you don't have to go to church
[1:08:03] you don't have to do this you know here
[1:08:06] this is happiness then people don't love
[1:08:09] you here take this
[1:08:11] and you see this and see this is again
[1:08:13] Satan tripping Israel up because Satan
[1:08:16] knew that God is subject to his own word
[1:08:18] so what does the prophet teach us that
[1:08:20] Dan and Ephraim
[1:08:22] where bows were removed
[1:08:25] when you read in the Book of Revelations
[1:08:26] their names are missing it was over this
[1:08:28] sin right here
[1:08:30] that I just read it was over worship
[1:08:33] now we know they'll be restored in the
[1:08:34] Millennium but from under Heaven their
[1:08:36] names have been removed their tribes
[1:08:39] have lost their identity because of
[1:08:42] false worship
[1:08:44] because they refuse to worship in spirit
[1:08:47] and in truth
[1:08:50] the Hebrew children were cast into a fir
[1:08:53] into the fiery furnace over worship it
[1:08:56] wasn't because they didn't pay their
[1:08:57] taxes it wasn't because they killed
[1:08:59] somebody
[1:09:00] it was because they refused to worship
[1:09:03] something else other than the god of the
[1:09:06] god of Heaven
[1:09:08] so as I said since before time Satan's
[1:09:11] always been listened for worship and in
[1:09:14] this evil age that we're living in he
[1:09:16] finally gets his way
[1:09:18] for a short amount of time he gets his
[1:09:20] way
[1:09:21] fighting for it from Before Time and in
[1:09:23] this day we're living in he gets it in
[1:09:25] second Thessalonians chapter 2 let no
[1:09:27] man deceive you by any means for that
[1:09:29] day shall not come except there cometh
[1:09:32] Falling Away first and that man of sin
[1:09:34] be revealed the Son of Perdition who
[1:09:36] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[1:09:39] that is called God or that is worship so
[1:09:42] that he as God sitteth in the temple of
[1:09:44] God showing himself that he is God
[1:09:47] that's right do you see everything that
[1:09:49] Satan had he wasn't Lucifer had he was
[1:09:52] not happy with he wanted worship
[1:09:57] he wanted to be the God he wanted to be
[1:10:01] God
[1:10:03] and so God allows him to be the God of
[1:10:06] this evil age
[1:10:08] and Brethren brings that sermon out it
[1:10:09] exalts he said and when the church world
[1:10:11] would not have the word of God rule over
[1:10:13] them they accepted a murder of Barabbas
[1:10:15] what did this do it exalted Satan so see
[1:10:19] when they accepted Barabbas just the
[1:10:21] fact that they sister Zoe accepted
[1:10:23] Barabbas
[1:10:25] that automatically
[1:10:28] exalted Satan
[1:10:30] you don't have to make two choices they
[1:10:33] didn't have to you know exalt Satan in
[1:10:35] one way necessarily and then receive
[1:10:37] Barabbas they did one and automatically
[1:10:39] did the other
[1:10:41] so when you refuse the word and you
[1:10:43] don't let the word take the preeminence
[1:10:45] in your life you're then exalting the
[1:10:47] world and then you're opening the door
[1:10:49] for Satan to have access to your life
[1:10:51] this word is protection the the blood is
[1:10:55] protection
[1:10:56] amen just like it was for Eve God don't
[1:10:59] change if it was her protection and it
[1:11:02] was Adam's protection then it's your
[1:11:04] protection so when somebody gets from
[1:11:06] that is why when people leave the
[1:11:08] message they open themselves wide open
[1:11:11] to Satan
[1:11:14] they never
[1:11:16] become a better person
[1:11:19] they never become a better person
[1:11:22] because this word is the truth and they
[1:11:24] do just like what Eve did so when Eve
[1:11:26] got out of the protection of the word
[1:11:27] that opened her wide open to Satan amen
[1:11:33] if it did it then it does it now
[1:11:36] Revelation 13 we know that Satan comes
[1:11:39] down and he forces worship he literally
[1:11:41] incarnates the Beast the false prophet
[1:11:43] becomes the Beast and what does he Force
[1:11:45] worship and if people and this is after
[1:11:49] we go home
[1:11:50] that is why now is the checking up time
[1:11:53] now's the time to trim your lamps fill
[1:11:56] them up with oil if you've got oil more
[1:11:59] oil more oil more oil you've got to be
[1:12:02] overflowing you don't want to you don't
[1:12:05] want to just barely make it and have the
[1:12:07] door just hit you no barely made it in
[1:12:10] you want to be able to go in with flying
[1:12:12] colors and not your flying colors but
[1:12:14] the flying colors of the of the cross
[1:12:15] the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only
[1:12:17] way to get in there Hallelujah
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:22] so that is how to get in now is the time
[1:12:25] because what happens after the bride
[1:12:27] goes home the Beast will then Force
[1:12:29] worship and it's the same spirit that
[1:12:31] was in Nebuchadnezzar because if they
[1:12:33] they refuse to worship they're going to
[1:12:35] have to give their lives that's right if
[1:12:37] they are to preserve the names of The
[1:12:38] Book of Life they have to give their
[1:12:40] lives
[1:12:43] it's a serious hour many times we can
[1:12:47] come to church and you hear sermons you
[1:12:49] hear sermons and it just gets to be so
[1:12:50] mundane
[1:12:53] brother Wayne I were talking about
[1:12:54] Noah's sermon 120 years the same sermon
[1:12:57] but one day that God shut the door
[1:13:01] God shut the door
[1:13:03] so we we see that Satan when he came
[1:13:05] when Jesus was on the earth the fullness
[1:13:07] of the godhead bodily and Satan's still
[1:13:10] coming to him
[1:13:11] last night we read the quote Satan came
[1:13:13] to the prophet so if he came to God
[1:13:15] himself he came to the prophet messenger
[1:13:16] he's going to come to every single one
[1:13:18] of us
[1:13:19] so when Satan came to Jesus in the hour
[1:13:22] of Temptation when Jesus had not eaten
[1:13:23] he was fasting for 40 days he was at a
[1:13:25] very weak point and Satan comes and he
[1:13:28] begins to tempt him Satan had three
[1:13:30] shots at Jesus and he had to make every
[1:13:32] one of them count he had three shots
[1:13:36] and one of those shots in Matthew 4 9
[1:13:40] and saith unto him
[1:13:42] all these things he showed him all the
[1:13:44] kingdoms of the world
[1:13:45] in a moment's time he showed him every
[1:13:48] civilization if you love history in
[1:13:50] their Glory day including America that
[1:13:52] we live in
[1:13:54] showed it to him in a moment of time and
[1:13:56] he said all these things will I give
[1:13:58] thee
[1:13:59] if that will fall down and worship me
[1:14:06] all of that everything that Satan had
[1:14:08] and everything that he built up by the
[1:14:09] way up until that time he was willing to
[1:14:11] give it away for one moment for Jesus to
[1:14:14] worship him can you imagine how bad
[1:14:17] Satan wants worshiped
[1:14:21] why does he want worship so bad because
[1:14:23] he wants to be like God
[1:14:27] then saith Jesus unto him get thee hints
[1:14:30] Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:14:33] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:14:35] shalt thou serve it was a Temptation for
[1:14:38] Jesus to get the world which he's going
[1:14:41] to fall heir to but he he's going to
[1:14:43] fall heir to because he paid for it
[1:14:46] so the Temptation was that he get all of
[1:14:48] that without paying the price
[1:14:51] Naturally Speaking imagine how tempting
[1:14:53] you'd be to say brother I will give you
[1:14:54] this Corvette right here you don't even
[1:14:56] have to pay for it
[1:14:58] it'd be a tempting proposition not pay
[1:15:00] for it or you're gonna have to work for
[1:15:02] it for years and years and years and
[1:15:03] years
[1:15:05] so Jesus was offered but do you know it
[1:15:08] would not I can imagine during that very
[1:15:10] moment he thought of you
[1:15:12] he could have all the world he could
[1:15:15] have it all but what good would that do
[1:15:17] because then he would be like he was
[1:15:19] back at the beginning
[1:15:21] what would have been the point of all
[1:15:22] that to have all the world he already
[1:15:24] had the world he created everything he
[1:15:26] had every he had the Angels they were
[1:15:28] worshiping him everything was perfect
[1:15:30] but he wasn't satisfied because he
[1:15:33] didn't have you sister June
[1:15:35] he wasn't satisfied
[1:15:37] and then whenever he still wasn't
[1:15:39] satisfied because under the fall you
[1:15:41] fell
[1:15:43] so he had to come and he had to pay the
[1:15:45] price
[1:15:46] not half price yeah
[1:15:49] you weren't on sale you weren't on
[1:15:50] clearance
[1:15:52] you come at a very high cost
[1:15:57] and he paid full price for you
[1:16:01] in the scriptures we find that there's a
[1:16:03] story about lepersy was a because of the
[1:16:05] times they lived in it was very you know
[1:16:07] dirty living in some ways and they just
[1:16:09] leprosy was very common and still isn't
[1:16:11] in very very poor countries
[1:16:13] and in Luke 17 and it came to pass 17
[1:16:16] verse 11 and it came to pass as he went
[1:16:19] to Jerusalem that he passed through the
[1:16:20] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[1:16:23] entered into a certain Village there met
[1:16:24] him
[1:16:26] 10 men that were leopards which stood
[1:16:28] afar off you talk about social
[1:16:30] distancing they had to stay away
[1:16:34] so we know that leprosy is a type of sin
[1:16:38] it starts just as a sore and then it
[1:16:39] begins to spread and it just keeps
[1:16:41] eating away
[1:16:42] and they lifted up their voices and said
[1:16:44] Jesus Master have mercy on us and when
[1:16:47] he saw them he said go show yourselves
[1:16:49] into the priest and it came to pass as
[1:16:51] they went they were cleansed
[1:16:54] see they took action upon the word what
[1:16:56] if you just said go your way and said
[1:16:57] well I'm not healed yet as they begin to
[1:17:00] act upon the word they were cleansed
[1:17:05] now watch in verse 15 and one of them
[1:17:08] There Were Ten
[1:17:11] one of them when he saw that he was
[1:17:13] healed
[1:17:14] turned back
[1:17:17] and with a loud voice glorified God
[1:17:22] ten percent
[1:17:24] and fell down at his face at his feet
[1:17:27] and fell down on his face at his feet
[1:17:29] and giving him thanks and he was a
[1:17:31] Samaritan just like the woman at the
[1:17:33] well a degraded a segregated group of
[1:17:36] people that nobody wanted the Jews
[1:17:39] couldn't stand
[1:17:40] Jesus answering and saying where they're
[1:17:43] not ten cleansed but where are the nine
[1:17:45] there are not found that return to give
[1:17:48] God to give glory to God save this
[1:17:51] stranger and he said unto him arise go
[1:17:54] thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:17:57] how many times does God do something for
[1:17:59] us and we don't even thank him
[1:18:02] how many times is God heal us and we
[1:18:05] don't tell nobody about it
[1:18:07] see it's worship
[1:18:10] God does something for you God gave you
[1:18:13] the Holy Ghost tell somebody God did
[1:18:15] something for you in the service tell
[1:18:16] somebody because then that gives them
[1:18:18] faith that spreads
[1:18:22] it's like wildfire if you're not called
[1:18:24] to preach tell how your fire got lit
[1:18:26] tell how your candle got lit so out of
[1:18:28] ten lepers only one had I had to have
[1:18:31] the decency or had the appreciation to
[1:18:34] come back and say thank you Lord
[1:18:37] if he cleansed your life from sin every
[1:18:40] servant should be thank you Jesus
[1:18:42] when we see how the world is acting and
[1:18:45] how they're dressing and how degraded
[1:18:46] they are it should be thank you Lord
[1:18:48] that could have been me because remember
[1:18:51] in your flesh we're no better than they
[1:18:54] are
[1:18:55] the only thing that separates us from
[1:18:57] them is this
[1:19:00] the blood of Jesus that's cleansed us
[1:19:02] amen so God help us to always be
[1:19:05] thankful amen and to always return and
[1:19:08] give worship not just once the next week
[1:19:11] and give worship the next time give
[1:19:13] worship when you're in your prayer
[1:19:14] closet give worship and not only give
[1:19:17] worship now hear this not only give
[1:19:19] worship after you get something
[1:19:22] but give worship before you see it
[1:19:26] that is where the true Victory and even
[1:19:28] the faith is
[1:19:31] give worship when you don't see it
[1:19:33] whenever once you receive it it's yours
[1:19:35] brother Bob once you receive it it's
[1:19:37] yours you then you start giving thanks
[1:19:40] water it with worship whatever it thinks
[1:19:42] if you plant a seed best ground in the
[1:19:45] world most fertile ground in the world
[1:19:46] doesn't matter if it doesn't get
[1:19:48] moisture
[1:19:50] your art could be just as open as it can
[1:19:52] ever be you can just receive the word as
[1:19:55] it comes a fourth
[1:19:56] but if you go out and you don't water it
[1:19:58] water it with praise with faith with
[1:20:01] Thanksgiving
[1:20:03] how are you going to ever be very
[1:20:04] fruitful
[1:20:08] so let's not be the 90 that never came
[1:20:11] back to return and give God thanks
[1:20:14] we don't see our prodigals come home
[1:20:16] thank God for me anyway thank God for
[1:20:19] their return ahead of time and when they
[1:20:22] do return praise the Lord and when they
[1:20:24] do return we have to be like like the
[1:20:26] like the prodigal like the father he
[1:20:28] didn't start just scolding what took you
[1:20:29] so long you spent all your inheritance
[1:20:31] and you went all the way down there in
[1:20:32] the enemy's country and you were around
[1:20:34] pigs and all them things
[1:20:36] with open arms he was there
[1:20:38] is nothing more powerful than love
[1:20:41] not judgment love
[1:20:45] because without the love of God none of
[1:20:47] us would be here
[1:20:49] now all in wine
[1:20:52] is very important together and we
[1:20:54] understand the oil represents the spirit
[1:20:55] and wine represents Revelation in the
[1:20:58] fourth seal and the quote Brotherhood
[1:20:59] says now as oil symbolize the Holy
[1:21:01] Spirit then we find that the oil and
[1:21:04] wine is connected in worship see always
[1:21:08] connected in worship amen we find that
[1:21:11] when you read the Old Testament that
[1:21:13] Aaron and the priest and the Levites
[1:21:15] before they would actually go to worship
[1:21:16] and enter to the Tabernacle they have to
[1:21:18] be Anointed with oil and dress riding
[1:21:20] and do things but it was always with oil
[1:21:22] David picks it up and it talks about how
[1:21:24] the anointing oil fell down Aaron's
[1:21:27] beard went all the way down to the Hem
[1:21:28] of His garments
[1:21:30] in Psalm 92 10 David said in my horn
[1:21:33] shalt thou exalt like the Horn of a
[1:21:35] unicorn
[1:21:36] I shall be Anointed with fresh oil
[1:21:41] that's what every service that's what
[1:21:44] every time in his presence should do for
[1:21:45] us is fresh oil
[1:21:48] I've had oh Lord I've had all my and you
[1:21:50] know in my lamp for 50 years or praise
[1:21:52] the Lord but how about fresh oil how
[1:21:54] about a fresh anointing
[1:21:56] because the enemy is always coming up
[1:21:57] with fresh attacks by the way he always
[1:21:59] finds fresh ways to come and attack you
[1:22:01] so why not get fresh oil and get
[1:22:04] anointed with fresh oil
[1:22:07] in Saint John 12 there's that ill-fained
[1:22:09] woman that prostitute that took oil
[1:22:11] when she came to worship Jesus
[1:22:14] when he was invited by Simon the
[1:22:15] Pharisee and you know he was sitting
[1:22:17] there in a corner unwelcome the
[1:22:19] unwelcomed Christ
[1:22:21] but yet she came and seen that he had a
[1:22:24] need and she brought oil
[1:22:27] and remember Simon the Pharisee sent out
[1:22:29] that invitation and brother and
[1:22:30] dramatizes it beautifully
[1:22:33] in the assignment the Pharisee brought
[1:22:35] Jesus there to be kind of a joke and
[1:22:37] just so people can can see him and
[1:22:39] things and it was a half-hearted
[1:22:41] invitation he didn't really want Jesus
[1:22:43] there
[1:22:44] right and he thought that Jesus came
[1:22:47] because of his invitation but Jesus came
[1:22:49] for this prostitute
[1:22:52] Jesus knew she was coming amen
[1:22:55] when the servant didn't wash Jesus's
[1:22:57] feet he knew he was right on track he
[1:22:58] didn't go wash his own feet he wasn't
[1:23:00] worried about it he knew that God had
[1:23:02] predestinated that God had showed him
[1:23:04] that there was a woman that was going to
[1:23:06] come and that's why he didn't move right
[1:23:08] he let her pour the oil he let her
[1:23:12] experience the type of the birth right
[1:23:14] there and get messy
[1:23:17] so Jesus came for her
[1:23:19] not for Simon that Pharisee
[1:23:22] when the Mary of Bethany took all in her
[1:23:24] Alabaster Box and broke it and poured it
[1:23:26] upon his head it was oil
[1:23:27] when she came to worship the master
[1:23:31] now in the Old Testament there was a
[1:23:33] story about the Widow of zarepath
[1:23:35] Brethren preaches sermons like be
[1:23:36] certain of God or Elijah in the meal
[1:23:38] offering and all these things and she
[1:23:40] was a widow woman and she typed the
[1:23:42] Bride of Jesus Christ he preaches
[1:23:43] spiritual food in due season amen
[1:23:46] and God sent her God sent Elijah to her
[1:23:49] he said Brotherhood said because she had
[1:23:50] the same nature that Elijah had
[1:23:53] you know later in the message brother
[1:23:54] Ram says that God makes his Messengers
[1:23:56] with a certain personality in a certain
[1:23:58] way to fit the people and the people to
[1:24:00] you know God has his way in everything
[1:24:02] so in First Kings chapter 17 we'll read
[1:24:05] here in verse 8.
[1:24:07] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[1:24:09] about Elijah saying arise get thee to
[1:24:13] zeropath which belongeth to Zina zaidon
[1:24:16] and dwell there behold I have commanded
[1:24:18] a widow woman there to sustain thee so
[1:24:22] he arose and went to zarapath and when
[1:24:23] he came to the gate of the city Behold a
[1:24:25] widow woman was there get their
[1:24:28] Gathering of sticks and he called to her
[1:24:31] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[1:24:33] water in a vessel that I may drink
[1:24:36] let me stop there and say that that
[1:24:39] drink of water he was asking for was a
[1:24:42] lot
[1:24:43] no rain for three and a half years
[1:24:47] and he comes a stranger asking a widow
[1:24:50] woman
[1:24:51] for a drink
[1:24:53] he was already asking a lot so because
[1:24:56] she had the same nature Elijah had she
[1:24:58] said I'll go do it
[1:25:00] and then she was going to fetch it he
[1:25:03] called to her he called her again and
[1:25:05] said bring me I pray thee a morsel of
[1:25:08] bread in thy hand
[1:25:10] that was the last two things she owned
[1:25:14] was the water and the morsel of bread
[1:25:19] no doubt when she turned to go get
[1:25:20] Elijah that water she thought at least I
[1:25:23] still have that cake
[1:25:26] at least you know maybe we can at least
[1:25:28] survive a few more days on the cake
[1:25:30] but then God asked even more of her
[1:25:33] right Amanda
[1:25:34] and said bring me a morsel
[1:25:38] of bread in thy hand
[1:25:41] and she said she was honest
[1:25:43] as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a
[1:25:46] cake but a handful of meal in a barrel
[1:25:48] and a little oil
[1:25:52] in a cruise
[1:25:54] and behold I am Gathering two sticks
[1:25:57] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[1:26:00] my son that we may eat it and die this
[1:26:02] was life and death
[1:26:05] this wasn't just going to a church
[1:26:07] service and going home and going about
[1:26:09] our day and going about our week this
[1:26:11] was life and death it came to the wire
[1:26:14] it's where the rubber meets the road
[1:26:17] however you want to say it it came down
[1:26:19] to reality
[1:26:21] she was in the hardest trial of her life
[1:26:26] her husband brother him teaches a spot
[1:26:27] in the military gave his life for Israel
[1:26:30] and here she was not understanding
[1:26:33] why she was going through this raising
[1:26:36] her son by herself in the middle of the
[1:26:38] worst drought known to mankind
[1:26:40] three and a half years of no rain
[1:26:44] it was not her fault there was no rain
[1:26:46] it was ahab's fault in Israel's fault
[1:26:48] she was a believer
[1:26:50] it's not your fault of the judgments
[1:26:53] that's on that's on This Nation
[1:26:55] God has made a way of Escape God has
[1:26:57] made a way of Escape for her and how he
[1:26:59] sent Elijah to her
[1:27:03] she was in the hardest trial of her life
[1:27:05] and her and her own son's literal life
[1:27:07] was at stake but she took the oil
[1:27:12] of the Spirit Worship and she mixed it
[1:27:15] with the meal which is the word
[1:27:18] spirit and Truth
[1:27:20] she mixed them both together the meal
[1:27:22] alone would have just been dry wouldn't
[1:27:24] have done anything the oil alone could
[1:27:26] not have made the cake but you put the
[1:27:27] two together and you got a cake on your
[1:27:30] hands
[1:27:33] she mixed it because remember the meal
[1:27:36] is a type of the word every bird has to
[1:27:38] be the same we've heard the prophet talk
[1:27:40] about this many times
[1:27:43] to make a cake offering
[1:27:45] for a prophet
[1:27:48] she was exhausted
[1:27:50] she was discouraged
[1:27:54] the prophet picks that up where she's
[1:27:55] praying God I don't know why I'm going
[1:27:57] through this
[1:27:59] my husband he was such a faithful
[1:28:01] servant of yours and you of yours and
[1:28:02] you took him home and here I am with the
[1:28:04] starving sun on my hands she was
[1:28:07] discouraged and weak but she still used
[1:28:09] the last bit of her energy she had
[1:28:13] to do God of service
[1:28:16] in verse 13 and Elijah said unto her
[1:28:18] fear not go and do as thou I said but
[1:28:21] make me thereof a little cake first
[1:28:25] that's an interesting word that she no
[1:28:27] doubt caught because if she said if he
[1:28:29] said first this has got to be a second
[1:28:33] he didn't just say go bake me a cake
[1:28:35] first then good luck yeah
[1:28:37] yeah you're on your own
[1:28:40] he said bake me a cake first but she
[1:28:43] only had enough for one
[1:28:45] so how can there only be a first when
[1:28:47] there's one
[1:28:48] you can't have a first let there be in a
[1:28:50] second if you're the only one running a
[1:28:52] race
[1:28:54] and you cross the finish line
[1:28:57] you're in first place but you're also in
[1:28:58] last place yeah
[1:29:00] there's nothing in between but if
[1:29:02] there's three people four people five
[1:29:03] people and there's the first place
[1:29:05] and if there's a first place there's a
[1:29:06] second and the third and so on
[1:29:09] so he said bake me a little cake first
[1:29:11] and bring it unto me and after
[1:29:15] make for thee and for thy son how am I
[1:29:19] going to make a cake after for me and my
[1:29:21] son when this is the last thing I've got
[1:29:23] she had to exercise some faith
[1:29:27] and now here comes thus saith the Lord
[1:29:29] for thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:29:30] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[1:29:32] neither shall the crews of oil fail
[1:29:35] until the day that the Lord sinneth rain
[1:29:37] upon the Earth
[1:29:39] the Holy Ghost will not run out
[1:29:42] the blessings of God will not run out
[1:29:44] for your life the word the Revelation
[1:29:47] that God has and he's sustaining you
[1:29:48] during this drought will never run out
[1:29:52] because you use your time and your
[1:29:54] energy to worship God
[1:29:57] well she had to believe the prophet's
[1:29:59] message because once the cake was made
[1:30:01] she couldn't take it back
[1:30:03] once she made it and gave it to him she
[1:30:05] had to have faith in what he said that
[1:30:08] there was going to be more
[1:30:10] so after he ate it she could go to the
[1:30:13] barrel and open it and there was meal
[1:30:15] she can run over to the cruise and there
[1:30:17] was oil
[1:30:20] why because she baked him a cake first
[1:30:24] she sought the kingdom of God first she
[1:30:27] mixed the oil with the word she mixed
[1:30:30] worship
[1:30:31] together
[1:30:34] in the message be certain of God he said
[1:30:36] she got the meal Christ Christ is a word
[1:30:39] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:30:40] Word was with God and the Word was made
[1:30:42] flesh and wrote Among Us the word and
[1:30:43] the oil the oil represents the Holy
[1:30:45] Spirit she took the Holy Spirit the word
[1:30:47] and the truth Jesus said the time's
[1:30:49] coming to the woman at the well that God
[1:30:51] will honor those who worship Him in
[1:30:52] spirit and in truth many people worship
[1:30:55] in spirit and not in truth
[1:30:58] many in truth and not in spirit
[1:31:01] he says but when you get them together
[1:31:06] then you've got something when the
[1:31:08] spirit of God gets mixed into the word
[1:31:12] because remember the letter killeth but
[1:31:14] the spirit giveth life
[1:31:17] so if you want the letter to have life
[1:31:19] in our lives we have to mix it with the
[1:31:22] spirit
[1:31:23] but when you get them together then
[1:31:25] you've got something the spirit of God
[1:31:26] gets into the word she mix it together
[1:31:28] and when you get the spirit of God on
[1:31:30] you mix with the word something's going
[1:31:32] to happen
[1:31:34] in another place he says but you take
[1:31:36] put them both correctly in their place
[1:31:39] there's a cake on the road there's
[1:31:43] something in the making you put them
[1:31:45] both together this morning in this
[1:31:46] service and you've got a cake on the
[1:31:48] road
[1:31:49] amen now notice whenever Elijah was at
[1:31:52] the brook God told Elijah I have
[1:31:55] commanded a widow woman to sustain thee
[1:31:59] now God told Elijah I've commanded her
[1:32:01] now it's not a command like you like you
[1:32:03] just whip somebody and make them do
[1:32:05] something but it's you know I looked it
[1:32:07] up it's like he charged her
[1:32:10] he commissioned her to do it but she had
[1:32:13] no idea
[1:32:14] here she was thinking the last meal I'm
[1:32:17] getting ready and God had already
[1:32:18] commanded her and she had no idea
[1:32:21] God told the prophet go here and I
[1:32:24] commanded that widow woman to sustain
[1:32:26] thee one cake one meal is not sustenance
[1:32:30] is repeated because remember the Bible
[1:32:31] said that he and she in their house ate
[1:32:33] many days so whenever he told her I
[1:32:36] commanded the widow woman to Phoebe
[1:32:39] she had didn't know it but God knew what
[1:32:41] she would do
[1:32:44] God might have commanded you God has
[1:32:46] commanded you to be a prayer Warrior
[1:32:50] he's commanded you to be the
[1:32:52] manifestation of the word remember it's
[1:32:54] not a just a whipping you've got to do
[1:32:56] this some abusive God is a god of love
[1:32:58] but he's charged you he's called you to
[1:33:00] it yeah you may not feel like it this
[1:33:03] morning
[1:33:05] you may have a heart for the thing of
[1:33:07] the world but yet you're elect so God is
[1:33:09] going to bring you around to this you
[1:33:11] may not realize that you are
[1:33:12] commissioned
[1:33:13] you may still be the prodigal son you
[1:33:16] may still be the prodigal daughter and
[1:33:17] not realize that is God calling out to
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:22] to take he God has commanded us to take
[1:33:25] a body change
[1:33:27] he's commanded that of the bride all
[1:33:29] along and she might not have realized it
[1:33:30] but now we've come into the realization
[1:33:32] that we are the final voice of the final
[1:33:34] age
[1:33:36] under our messenger
[1:33:39] you may not feel Worthy
[1:33:41] but it doesn't matter what you feel is
[1:33:43] what's been spoken of you the widow
[1:33:45] woman didn't feel worthy to house Elijah
[1:33:48] but God had already commanded it
[1:33:52] in the united on one head United under
[1:33:54] one head brother Ram said you might be
[1:33:56] filled with Elvis Presley's rock and
[1:33:58] roll that's true
[1:33:59] but you're filled with something
[1:34:02] in your own life Bears you record of
[1:34:04] what you're filled with
[1:34:07] buy their fruits you shall knows them
[1:34:09] you're filled with something you might
[1:34:10] be filled with a bunch of laziness just
[1:34:12] too lazy to do anything about it well
[1:34:14] you don't he said well you don't have to
[1:34:15] be that way
[1:34:16] Christ died that you might be cleansed
[1:34:19] from all those things
[1:34:21] he said God made a place in there to put
[1:34:23] himself in God wants you to be filled
[1:34:25] with himself
[1:34:27] what takes place when you're filled with
[1:34:28] God when you're filled with God you're
[1:34:31] filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled
[1:34:32] with power you're filled with love with
[1:34:35] joy with peace with long suffering with
[1:34:37] goodness with meekness with gentleness
[1:34:39] with worship
[1:34:42] you're filled with joy David said my cup
[1:34:45] runneth over you think and all of our
[1:34:48] cups are running over
[1:34:50] if you're a Believer your cup is running
[1:34:52] over but Satan can make you think that
[1:34:55] you're not that you know I don't have
[1:34:56] this oh if I could only be like this oh
[1:34:58] if I could only do this and here there
[1:35:00] you are with your cup running over
[1:35:03] David always had trouble in his life but
[1:35:05] then he he looked and said my cup runeth
[1:35:08] over
[1:35:10] I'm so blessed that my cup runneth over
[1:35:14] it and he said all that without the Holy
[1:35:16] Ghost
[1:35:19] and I didn't realize Brotherhood said
[1:35:21] here and if David had a cup running over
[1:35:22] before the Holy Ghost come what would it
[1:35:25] be now
[1:35:27] here because remember true worship is
[1:35:28] not put on and hyped up what we do is
[1:35:31] begin to meditate on God's goodness
[1:35:34] on our way to church we should begin to
[1:35:36] talk about God we should begin to think
[1:35:38] about God and what does that do it
[1:35:39] begins to take our minds off the things
[1:35:41] of the world and the natural things that
[1:35:43] we have to do and we begin to put our
[1:35:45] mind in a mind frame to come and we hear
[1:35:47] from God and many times God can confirm
[1:35:49] what you are talking about in the car
[1:35:52] 10 minutes before you got here
[1:35:55] right here in the service
[1:35:57] but we meditate upon God's goodness and
[1:35:59] as we meditate he says so when the
[1:36:01] spirit of God is near what will take
[1:36:02] place salvation will be introduced
[1:36:05] salvation that will bring a spiritual
[1:36:07] worship not a singing of hymns
[1:36:10] altogether but a worship in the spirit
[1:36:15] so as an example the song again I
[1:36:17] mentioned yesterday but way maker
[1:36:18] Miracle Worker promise keeper light in
[1:36:22] the darkness as that song Goes Forth
[1:36:24] begin to meditate how he made a way in
[1:36:26] your life
[1:36:28] and then it's not just a song that you
[1:36:30] just sing along with a song leader you
[1:36:32] then realize God you made a way for me
[1:36:34] and then what does that do it makes you
[1:36:36] lift your hands and worship and say
[1:36:37] thank you Lord
[1:36:39] thank you Lord for making a way for me
[1:36:42] in that situation
[1:36:44] Miracle Worker you think my goodness God
[1:36:47] healed me God saved my loved one God
[1:36:49] saved my parents he saved my children
[1:36:51] that was a miracle I couldn't see how
[1:36:53] that could happen but God you did it
[1:36:55] you're a miracle worker what does that
[1:36:56] make you do it makes you worship thank
[1:36:59] you Lord for being a miracle worker
[1:37:01] because then you worship him for being a
[1:37:03] miracle worker in your life
[1:37:05] it's you know someone gets up and
[1:37:07] testifies and we praise the Lord because
[1:37:09] we give him all the praise honor and
[1:37:10] Glory
[1:37:11] but whenever it's something in your life
[1:37:13] that he's done
[1:37:15] that's something altogether different
[1:37:17] it's more personal worship then
[1:37:21] when he kept when he's PR he's a promise
[1:37:23] keeper think of all the promises he's
[1:37:25] kept in your life
[1:37:27] when he's kept you when you couldn't
[1:37:28] keep yourself
[1:37:30] you then begin to worship him and you
[1:37:32] thank him for it
[1:37:34] God likes to be worshiped he likes to be
[1:37:36] he likes to be thanked and appreciated
[1:37:39] when you do things for somebody and they
[1:37:40] don't they don't act like they
[1:37:41] appreciate it very much it just kind of
[1:37:43] it makes you a little bummed doesn't it
[1:37:46] but whenever someone appreciates what
[1:37:47] you did thank you I appreciate that
[1:37:52] so how much more to God
[1:37:55] he said God likes to be worshiping when
[1:37:57] you worship him his brother him says in
[1:37:59] the power of transformation it just
[1:38:01] isn't exactly singing a song as we do
[1:38:02] but singing in the spirit of worship you
[1:38:05] see then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce
[1:38:08] back
[1:38:09] so when the spirit has fallen we worship
[1:38:11] him in the spirit he's a living God it's
[1:38:15] not like the idol just they the the
[1:38:16] pagans they prostrate themselves and
[1:38:18] they worship but not on the idol never
[1:38:19] talks back that it's never nothing God
[1:38:21] will talk back to you you feel the
[1:38:24] spirit bouncing back to you amen and
[1:38:26] many times that expression may be a
[1:38:28] shout maybe that expression will be
[1:38:29] nothing it'll just be silent crying what
[1:38:31] is that the spirit then begins to move
[1:38:33] and is brooding over you because you got
[1:38:37] out of your comfort zone because you
[1:38:39] chose to worship Him
[1:38:44] don't allow the enemy to make you crusty
[1:38:47] in your experience and so dry that you
[1:38:50] can't think of a reason a good reason to
[1:38:52] worship God
[1:38:54] if you're breathing you've got a reason
[1:38:55] to worship God
[1:38:57] because Satan will give you will give
[1:38:59] you spiritual Amnesia if you're not
[1:39:00] careful
[1:39:02] and when Satan comes and tries to bring
[1:39:04] up your past remind them of his future
[1:39:07] he brings up your past we'll say well
[1:39:09] use that as a reason to Worship the Lord
[1:39:12] when Satan tries to remind you of what
[1:39:14] you used to be and what you used to do
[1:39:15] was say well that's under the blood but
[1:39:17] since you reminded me thank you Lord I'm
[1:39:19] not that anymore you see how you turn
[1:39:22] that back around on him
[1:39:23] he reminds you of it and you take that
[1:39:26] as an example to put your finger in his
[1:39:28] eye and Worship the Lord
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:31] because he reminded you that God
[1:39:32] delivered you from that while he's
[1:39:34] trying to make you feel bad about it
[1:39:37] turn it back on Satan
[1:39:39] you know you think the wise man traveled
[1:39:41] for two years to worship baby Jesus
[1:39:44] two years for a church service
[1:39:48] Queen of Sheba for three months on the
[1:39:50] back of a camel in the desert
[1:39:53] to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[1:39:56] in the Book of Revelations and we'll try
[1:39:59] and bring this to a close but in the
[1:40:00] Book of Revelations
[1:40:01] when Jesus Christ takes the book The
[1:40:03] Lamb the only one that was Worthy
[1:40:07] he takes the book let's read that in
[1:40:09] Revelations 5 8. and when he had taken
[1:40:11] the book The Four beasts and the Four
[1:40:13] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[1:40:15] lamb you see the effect that the opening
[1:40:17] of the word has
[1:40:19] it doesn't make it should never make us
[1:40:22] arrogant or puffed up or prideful
[1:40:24] the opening of the word makes us realize
[1:40:27] and brings humility
[1:40:30] right and it immediately brings about
[1:40:32] worship
[1:40:34] amen having every one of them hearts and
[1:40:37] golden vials full of odors which are the
[1:40:39] prayers of the Saints and they sang a
[1:40:41] new song
[1:40:42] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[1:40:44] take the book and to open the seals
[1:40:46] thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:40:48] redeemed us to our God by thy blood out
[1:40:50] of every Kindred and tongue and people
[1:40:51] and nation and is made unto us our God
[1:40:54] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:40:56] the earth and I beheld and heard the
[1:40:58] voice of many angels round about the
[1:41:00] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[1:41:01] the number of them was Ten Thousand
[1:41:03] Times Ten Thousand and thousands of
[1:41:06] thousands
[1:41:08] that's an innumerable amount of people
[1:41:11] and and because of the effect of the
[1:41:13] open book
[1:41:16] it leads them sane with a loud voice
[1:41:18] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[1:41:21] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[1:41:23] strength and honor and glory and
[1:41:24] blessing worship worship worship worship
[1:41:28] because the opening of the word
[1:41:30] the instantaneous brother Louise the
[1:41:33] instantaneous reaction to the opening of
[1:41:36] the word was worship
[1:41:39] thank you Lord
[1:41:42] not cut somebody down with Doctrine not
[1:41:46] beat people over the head worship
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:49] now listen he said here in Revelation
[1:41:51] chapter five brother I'm speaking now
[1:41:53] this is the time when everything must be
[1:41:55] worshiped he's breaking down the Book of
[1:41:57] Revelation here now remember how
[1:41:59] appropriate don't let us miss this now
[1:42:01] listen close when all the mysteries of
[1:42:03] the church age was finished when all the
[1:42:05] mysteries of the plans of redemption
[1:42:07] them Seven Seals was open right
[1:42:09] immediately after this now look it's
[1:42:11] time everything in heaven and everything
[1:42:13] on Earth to worship God
[1:42:17] now watch what takes place and they sung
[1:42:20] a new song saying thou worthy listen
[1:42:22] what a worship that was the elders the
[1:42:25] Beast everything fell right before him
[1:42:27] see like that when he made his complete
[1:42:30] plan
[1:42:33] so when the word opens it immediately
[1:42:35] brings us to worship because we see we
[1:42:37] can't be deceived amen we see what Satan
[1:42:40] did we see we're not going to fall like
[1:42:41] Eve did we're predestinated not to fall
[1:42:44] we're going to take a body change we're
[1:42:46] going to come back and Rule and reign
[1:42:47] with him for a thousand years we're
[1:42:49] going to sit in judgment with him why
[1:42:50] because the book is open amen the church
[1:42:52] age is not did not realize that but now
[1:42:55] that the opening of the word has come we
[1:42:56] realize that and what does it make us do
[1:42:58] worship Worship the Lord
[1:43:02] because after there in the Book of
[1:43:04] Revelation in verse 13 it now becomes
[1:43:06] John's turn hey John is seeing the Lamb
[1:43:08] come and take the book he's seeing all
[1:43:10] this worship going on and John can't say
[1:43:12] still
[1:43:12] so the prophet picks us up and he says
[1:43:15] in every creature which is in heaven and
[1:43:17] in the earth and under the Earth and
[1:43:19] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:43:21] in them heard I saying they heard John
[1:43:24] it was his time to worship he
[1:43:27] appreciated watching the Beast he
[1:43:28] appreciated watching the elders he
[1:43:30] appreciated watching all the angels of
[1:43:31] heaven worship but John wanted in on
[1:43:33] that worship
[1:43:34] just like when they're on a testimony on
[1:43:36] the sea the disciples to turn but they
[1:43:38] were they were itching they were wanting
[1:43:39] they were wanting to testify when's it
[1:43:41] going to be my turn Andrew sit down so
[1:43:43] because I I'm Peter and I've got
[1:43:45] something to say yeah
[1:43:47] yeah John wanted to turn to worship
[1:43:52] when we get on the other side it ain't
[1:43:54] gonna matter we get in his presence and
[1:43:55] we're going to worship him for 10 000
[1:43:57] years a piece it's not going to be like
[1:43:59] you go to an amusement parking man this
[1:44:00] line is taking forever no
[1:44:03] you go in the drive-through Lane try and
[1:44:05] get a bite to eat and the drive-thru
[1:44:06] Lane is so long and you get impatient
[1:44:09] there's not gonna be any impatience
[1:44:10] there there's not gonna be any jealousy
[1:44:11] there man that that brother's taking
[1:44:13] forever what's taking so long I want to
[1:44:15] get to Jesus that's not going to exist
[1:44:17] there
[1:44:18] because when I get there
[1:44:26] I'm gonna take my time
[1:44:30] and when you get there I want you to
[1:44:33] take your time
[1:44:35] because it's not it's going to be all
[1:44:37] about worship
[1:44:38] during the Millennium it's gonna be all
[1:44:40] about worship we're gonna see what he
[1:44:42] did he's he's standing there lighting
[1:44:43] the whole city
[1:44:44] with his presence
[1:44:47] and it'll be worshiped
[1:44:50] when the prophet of God said whenever
[1:44:52] you see a log cabin
[1:44:54] and you hear somebody sing Amazing Grace
[1:44:57] he's not going to be on the front porch
[1:44:58] preaching he's already done that
[1:45:02] Amazing Grace is something we'll always
[1:45:04] sing
[1:45:05] all of our past and all the all the
[1:45:08] human elements of life is very temporal
[1:45:10] brother but there's two things that
[1:45:11] God's gonna allow
[1:45:13] on himself there as an eternal Memorial
[1:45:16] and that is the nail prince in his hands
[1:45:19] and the the scar in his side
[1:45:22] and no doubt when he raises his hands
[1:45:26] and we see the nail scars it'll always
[1:45:29] be a memorial for us to worship Him
[1:45:34] sorry brother that's what it's all about
[1:45:36] he created us for worship in the Book of
[1:45:38] Revelations in chapter four and and
[1:45:40] we're going to get ready to close but it
[1:45:41] says in verse 9 and all and when all the
[1:45:43] beasts
[1:45:45] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:45:47] that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:45:48] forever and ever the Four and Twenty
[1:45:50] Elders fall down before him that sat on
[1:45:52] the throne and worship him that liveth
[1:45:55] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[1:45:58] Before the Throne
[1:46:01] what is a count a crown a type of
[1:46:04] authority
[1:46:06] power
[1:46:08] dignity whatever and they get all of
[1:46:11] that
[1:46:13] and they cast It Before the Throne
[1:46:15] they give it all up
[1:46:19] because it's all about the Lord Jesus
[1:46:21] Christ
[1:46:24] used these words he said in all the
[1:46:26] celebrity of Heaven
[1:46:29] took their crowns from their heads and
[1:46:32] bowed
[1:46:35] and knowed that he was Worthy
[1:46:41] brother makes different comments about
[1:46:43] receiving a crown of life and you know
[1:46:45] and all these things I don't know I
[1:46:47] don't know exactly you know literal
[1:46:49] figuratively you know all these things
[1:46:51] is it's still the truth but regardless
[1:46:53] of what it is
[1:46:54] we're going to lay it all down on his
[1:46:56] feet
[1:47:00] the celebrity of Heaven you think about
[1:47:01] that
[1:47:03] all the beasts the ones that have
[1:47:04] guarded the Tree of Life
[1:47:07] throughout all ages all the seraphims
[1:47:10] it's all about him
[1:47:15] it's all about him
[1:47:18] it's not about the preacher it's not
[1:47:20] about the singers it's not about the
[1:47:22] who's who it's all about him
[1:47:26] and to give you an Insight many times
[1:47:28] the preacher that's standing up here
[1:47:29] don't even want to don't may not feel
[1:47:31] like preaching
[1:47:34] maybe they're in the office there
[1:47:35] yawning and tired in their flesh
[1:47:39] but it's not about them
[1:47:42] it's about him
[1:47:44] you may not always feel like coming to
[1:47:46] church but it's not about you
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:48] when you think it's about you that's
[1:47:50] being selfish
[1:47:53] it's about him
[1:47:54] the Widow of zeropath she wasn't selfish
[1:47:57] she was about her son
[1:48:00] that's what it was about
[1:48:02] so the the question I'd like to leave
[1:48:04] you with here is we bring this to an end
[1:48:07] is he Worthy
[1:48:10] is Jesus Christ worthy of all the
[1:48:13] worship
[1:48:17] all the Adoration
[1:48:20] all the praise and all the honor is he
[1:48:24] so if he is worthy
[1:48:28] then why don't we worship Him
[1:48:32] you say well I Do Worship Him
[1:48:34] we can all worship him more
[1:48:38] and I'm not just talking about church
[1:48:39] I'm not trying to don't don't
[1:48:41] misunderstand me I'm not trying to get
[1:48:42] you pumped up or or to do anything I'm
[1:48:44] talking about in your daily life worship
[1:48:46] Him
[1:48:47] think upon his goodness
[1:48:50] driving down the car think about how
[1:48:52] good he is to you
[1:48:54] because that will draw him to you
[1:48:58] let our lives worship him every moment
[1:49:01] of the day
[1:49:04] when you're in your hardest trial of
[1:49:06] your life like the Widow's air path
[1:49:08] and you had no idea on which way to turn
[1:49:10] and how Inns are going to meet or what's
[1:49:13] going to happen and how this is going to
[1:49:14] come to be or that just worship yes
[1:49:17] let him deal with it let him deal with
[1:49:19] it
[1:49:20] we worship him because he is worthy
[1:49:25] we should be
[1:49:28] the happiest people on the face of the
[1:49:31] earth when we were just here a few days
[1:49:33] ago we were visiting
[1:49:34] we're brother Bobby sister Monica took
[1:49:36] us there across the street from their
[1:49:38] house they've got like a little new
[1:49:40] shopping center they're building up and
[1:49:41] took us to little English place with
[1:49:43] some fish and chips they call it
[1:49:45] and we were in there and just we were
[1:49:46] you know a big group and we're just
[1:49:47] family we're just enjoying our company
[1:49:49] and our fellowship and we're just there
[1:49:50] ordering and we weren't
[1:49:52] act trying to act no weird way just be
[1:49:54] you
[1:49:56] and when we're just sitting there we get
[1:49:58] our food and it takes a while because
[1:49:59] there's about 100 of us so it takes a
[1:50:00] while
[1:50:01] for them to bring us our food so we're
[1:50:03] all kind of just sitting outside and
[1:50:04] we're eating and and you know chasing
[1:50:07] little kids around and
[1:50:08] right about the time we're about to wrap
[1:50:10] up just a complete stranger comes up to
[1:50:12] us and Kyle gives us the nicest
[1:50:13] compliments there that we look like the
[1:50:15] happiest people
[1:50:18] sure we didn't end out of track
[1:50:22] we didn't walk into the restaurant with
[1:50:24] a big cross necklace on our chest
[1:50:29] all we did
[1:50:31] just just be natural
[1:50:34] and the world is watching and they pick
[1:50:36] up very easy and for every person that
[1:50:38] tells you something very nice
[1:50:40] many think it but may not tell you
[1:50:44] but you're a light don't forget what a
[1:50:46] light that you are
[1:50:48] it's an evil day that we live in it's a
[1:50:50] very dark day
[1:50:52] and you may not think that your realm of
[1:50:53] influence is all that big but it don't

[1:54:04] the lighter my own you believe that
[1:54:09] the more that I that I release
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:39] for the more that I Surrender you heard
[1:54:44] a good message
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:09] [Applause]
[1:55:11] foreign
[1:55:13] love you more
[1:55:17] and it gets easier
[1:55:20] to understand
[1:55:23] the road I'm traveling down no more
[1:55:28] wavering

[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:32] more than I Surrender the latter my love
[1:56:36] amen you know William you you're talking
[1:56:40] about surrendering and getting you know
[1:56:43] getting getting all this stuff out of
[1:56:44] you and uh you know we and we talk about
[1:56:48] worship
[1:56:49] really true worship because we worship
[1:56:52] in spirit and truth so we don't worship
[1:56:54] frivolously we know who to worship what
[1:56:57] to worship and why
[1:56:59] all right so we got all that down so
[1:57:02] when we raise our hands when we confess
[1:57:06] with our mouth
[1:57:07] God has to come on the scene and honor
[1:57:11] our worship he doesn't have to honor the
[1:57:14] worship out there but he honors the
[1:57:16] worship of his children he takes care of
[1:57:19] his kids and then what do we do about
[1:57:22] give back to him we worship him there's
[1:57:25] nothing else in this world to worship
[1:57:26] except the Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[1:57:28] only man to worship the only person
[1:57:31] there is nothing else brother William
[1:57:34] and I were talking today this morning
[1:57:36] you know but but it's a strange thing
[1:57:38] about God God sometimes a strange he's a
[1:57:40] strange person uh to the world but it
[1:57:44] makes sense because he said he said even
[1:57:46] if you've done this to
[1:57:48] one of my little ones he said you've
[1:57:51] done it unto me
[1:57:53] so what does God want us to do true
[1:57:55] worship is as brother Brandon was
[1:57:57] talking about is loving
[1:58:00] your fellow brother loving your fellow
[1:58:02] sister loving somebody in the body of
[1:58:05] Christ
[1:58:07] the Lord's telling you to do that
[1:58:10] before you even worship him because you
[1:58:12] got to get right you got to get that
[1:58:13] brotherly kindness down we're fixing to
[1:58:16] head on to that brother kindness and
[1:58:17] that's pretty rough because you know
[1:58:19] Sam who how close is your neighbor
[1:58:21] Brother Sam you got a neighbor that's
[1:58:23] pretty close to you
[1:58:26] couple hundred feet you ever talk to him
[1:58:30] oh wow okay never mind then
[1:58:33] um I'll use somebody else
[1:58:35] um no I tell you those of you that know
[1:58:37] where I live I live next to two gay guys
[1:58:39] they're they're they're
[1:58:41] um homosexual
[1:58:43] brother Brown told us the Bible tells us
[1:58:45] we're supposed to love our neighbor
[1:58:48] as we love
[1:58:50] ourself
[1:58:52] amen listen as we love ourself now I
[1:58:57] like me pretty good
[1:58:59] but I'm supposed to love them the same
[1:59:01] amount that's the love of God
