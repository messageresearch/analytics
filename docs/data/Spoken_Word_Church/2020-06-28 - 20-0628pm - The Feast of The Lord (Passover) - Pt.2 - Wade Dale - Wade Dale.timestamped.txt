[25:22] through the Book of Leviticus
[25:23] 23 we're gonna start on the feast days
[25:26] now they're gonna put this on the board
[25:29] and I've been trying to find this sister
[25:30] Barbara bless her sweetheart I never
[25:33] could run one of these off but she just
[25:35] brought me one this morning and then
[25:37] brother Joe and brother Anderson in the
[25:40] back they just piggybacked and made
[25:42] y'all one color if you made you a color
[25:45] one they made you one it's got some
[25:47] color to it so we'll be using that chart
[25:49] that will be the calendar of Israel and
[25:52] the feast so if everybody's got one then
[25:56] we're gonna put it on the screen so
[25:57] thank God for technology will use that
[26:00] layout of seeing technology for the
[26:03] glory of the Lord so Leviticus 23 verse
[26:08] 1 let's bow our heads family father
[26:10] thank you for this day that you give us
[26:12] we pray now that your sanctify us
[26:14] through this little journey that we're
[26:15] taking Lord showing in this in this
[26:18] feast of you that you had a group of
[26:23] people that were special to your heart
[26:25] and you were wanting to lead them and
[26:27] guide them through the world of Egypt
[26:29] and out of the land of Egypt and into
[26:31] the promised land and you gave them
[26:32] ordinances and things to to do and and
[26:35] Lord it was just a symbol of the things
[26:38] that we as Christians do ourselves
[26:40] that you are the you are the Passover
[26:43] lamb that died on the cross of Calvary
[26:45] for us Lord and you set us free from the
[26:49] land of Egypt that we all came from
[26:51] Father we pray that you just be with us
[26:53] today be with the service you be the
[26:55] active participant Lord you'd be the one
[26:57] that does the speaking you'd be the one
[26:59] that does hearing and without you Lord
[27:02] we're not anything probably give us this
[27:04] day our daily bread forgive us of our
[27:05] sins bless us in Jesus name Amen
[27:09] so the feast this is the Feast of the
[27:12] Lord this is not the feast of Israel the
[27:15] Lord never called them that he called
[27:16] them the Feast of the Lord all right so
[27:18] here we go this is the Passover and
[27:21] we're going to get into this today and
[27:24] hopefully we can do this in two or three
[27:27] hours so tell me we have we just takes a
[27:33] long time for us to talk you ought to
[27:35] know that Leviticus
[27:37] three one and the Lord spake unto Moses
[27:40] saying speaking to the children of
[27:42] Israel and say unto them concerning the
[27:44] Feast of the Lord which ye shall
[27:46] proclaim to be holy convocations even
[27:49] these are my feast all right they're not
[27:53] israel's feast they're God's feast all
[27:56] right six days shall work be done but
[27:58] the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest
[28:00] an holy convocation you shall do no work
[28:03] therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in
[28:06] all your dwellings now that tells us
[28:08] about the seven day the seventh day
[28:11] being the Sabbath that is not a feast
[28:13] day he's just telling them that this is
[28:15] what's gonna happen you're gonna work
[28:16] six days and you're gonna be off the
[28:18] seventh day everybody got that say Amen
[28:20] okay but that has nothing to do that's
[28:22] not a feast day that's a set time that
[28:25] God set for them to not do anything
[28:28] these are the feasts of the Lord even
[28:30] holy convocations which ye shall
[28:31] proclaim in their season all right now
[28:35] here's the first one in the fourteenth
[28:37] day of the first month at evening all
[28:40] right all right
[28:41] even an evening is the Lord's Passover
[28:45] you may be seated in the Lord at his
[28:47] blessing for the reading of the word now
[28:52] I want to read you a quote I from the
[28:58] Prophet hearing who's this in 1959 and
[29:06] will explain to Tommy if she has any
[29:08] questions about who this person is so
[29:11] anyway the people were so crowded around
[29:13] the gates the streets were jammed and
[29:14] there was not even room for people to
[29:16] sleep they were laying outside the wall
[29:18] all over the grounds because this was to
[29:20] Passover and people came from all over
[29:22] the known world to worship at this time
[29:24] it was a time when the Pascal lamb was
[29:27] slain and it and the it represented
[29:29] their deliverance out of Egypt the
[29:31] bondage and they kept this annually
[29:33] every year this great Passover took
[29:35] place and it was one of the most
[29:37] outstanding times or events of the
[29:39] Jewish religion because it meant the
[29:41] time they were delivered now look all
[29:42] people love to think of that the time
[29:46] they were delivered that's the same way
[29:48] with you and I we are going to
[29:50] talk about what happened to natural
[29:52] Israel but there's a spiritual
[29:55] implication showing how that we had a
[29:58] Paschal Lamb and how you and I were
[30:01] caught in Egypt and then we one day God
[30:07] came and paid a price and got us out of
[30:10] Egypt and then we went through our
[30:11] journey into the Promised Land all right
[30:14] so this is I've said many times before
[30:17] and the Bible tells us in Corinthians
[30:19] that these were all given four examples
[30:21] to whom the ends of the world would come
[30:23] upon that's us the end of the world
[30:26] didn't come upon the first church age
[30:27] second church age thirty raids all the
[30:28] way up to number seven we're in the end
[30:30] of the seventh church age and God has
[30:32] give us grace to know where we're at
[30:35] where we came from what we're doing here
[30:37] where we're going like what brother Dale
[30:38] was talking about this morning giving us
[30:40] foreknowledge to know that we were in
[30:43] the mind of God and that we were going
[30:46] to come here and we were going to be a
[30:47] human but we know where we're going
[30:51] amen it's gonna be a sir for us it's a
[30:55] spiritual journey but we also have an
[30:58] actual journey just like the children of
[31:00] Israel did so alright let's get started
[31:03] let's show now the feast in Strong's
[31:06] Concordance the feast is a sacred season
[31:08] a set feast are an appointed season
[31:12] listen there was not and we talked about
[31:17] this morning this one in singular there
[31:20] there was not a Holy Ghost indwelling in
[31:22] the Old Testament to give these people a
[31:26] rudder or a moral way to do things
[31:31] so God set them up some feast all right
[31:34] you keep this feast you keep this feast
[31:35] you keep this feast alright but what it
[31:38] is though it's typing about you and what
[31:40] we're doing now so a feast is appointed
[31:42] season now convocation because they're
[31:44] holy convocations I got to slow down
[31:49] reading calling together a sacred
[31:54] assembly so what God told the Israelites
[31:56] to do their children of Israel now what
[32:00] happened is just to get started with
[32:01] this thing let's get a little history
[32:03] that
[32:04] children of Israel regards people
[32:05] everybody say a man if you say man you
[32:07] won't fall asleep that was kind of weak
[32:09] that sounds better if you were to
[32:11] ballgame it'd been a lot louder than
[32:13] that but the children of it thank you
[32:15] leaf thank you sister
[32:17] but that you y'all act up when company's
[32:20] here you can come again if you want then
[32:26] keep them away
[32:28] but here we got the children of Israel
[32:30] listen they're God's people you and I
[32:34] are God's people but they were God's
[32:36] people first amen so the children of
[32:38] Israel he told them all these different
[32:40] things he give them prophets he give
[32:42] them Joseph he give them Abraham he gave
[32:45] him all these different ones but what
[32:46] happened was they got caught in the
[32:49] wrong place they got caught in Egypt and
[32:53] they had to stay down there for 430
[32:56] years under bondage to the Egyptians but
[33:00] God promised them that he was going to
[33:02] bring them out not with a noodle hand or
[33:06] some little limp son no a mighty hand he
[33:09] was going to show the world that his
[33:13] people that are living in this Egypt I'm
[33:17] gonna bring them out and there's nothing
[33:19] the United States Russia China there's
[33:22] nothing they can do about cuz this great
[33:25] Egypt was the greatest nation in the
[33:28] world and here's this little group of
[33:31] people down in Egypt couple million you
[33:34] know scattered around and here's this
[33:36] great mighty Egypt several hundred
[33:38] million people you know and here's just
[33:40] a little group of people and they made
[33:41] them slave so in their making them
[33:43] slaves in that we were slaves to sin in
[33:52] Egypt but you know I was telling them
[33:55] they had one promise you're coming out
[34:00] you're coming out you're not gonna be in
[34:02] bondage I'm gonna bring you out with a
[34:05] mighty hand I'm gonna send you a prophet
[34:07] I'm gonna send you an angel and I'm
[34:12] gonna send you a lamb that's that for me
[34:17] okay
[34:18] so anyway so here the children of Israel
[34:21] and I just I was thinking about this
[34:23] yesterday and Tommy knows how I think
[34:24] that's pretty off not awful but just a
[34:27] little off so here you got good you see
[34:30] where we're fixing to come to now the
[34:32] reason I want to set this stage this way
[34:34] is because look how there had already
[34:37] been like nine or so plagues we're
[34:42] coming to the last plague we're coming
[34:45] to the day of deliverance we're coming
[34:48] to where they're going to walk out and
[34:49] Egypt is gonna be glad to get rid of
[34:52] them
[34:53] hey man so I said this is and this is
[34:56] the way we should be I mean here comes
[34:59] here comes here comes our there's a lot
[35:01] riding on his brand-new donkey he pulls
[35:04] up in the Employee of the Month parking
[35:07] place hey they gotta make bricks and
[35:12] they're just as happy and they're clean
[35:14] and everything's fine they don't have no
[35:16] problem and they walk in I said ma'am I
[35:19] punch my time clock see my new donkey in
[35:23] the Egyptian Oh Earl the Egyptian he's
[35:25] over there ain't slept three or four
[35:31] days got lice all over him locust has
[35:34] done eat up all this grass his donkey
[35:39] died it blowed an engine I was gonna say
[35:47] this anyway where the time we come here
[35:48] or not but it's just comical though you
[35:50] got these people these chosen do you not
[35:54] work know where I'm going there these
[35:55] chosen people walking in this world and
[35:59] and you know early Egyptian he's like oh
[36:01] it's the dark let's not I couldn't see
[36:03] anything and you know IRA there's a lot
[36:05] he's like what do you mean we partied
[36:07] till three o'clock
[36:08] we ate matzah and we had oh sorry that's
[36:15] how God takes care of his people because
[36:18] we're in the darkest time we've ever
[36:20] been in we've got all these different
[36:21] things that we're going through you
[36:23] should be able to walk into work or walk
[36:25] into Walmart or anywhere with a big old
[36:27] smile on your face and not have to worry
[36:28] about the the virus or the lice are the
[36:39] locusts are the frogs all over the point
[36:42] you see what they went through and
[36:44] they're looking at a group of people
[36:46] going how are you not something yeah you
[36:52] know what God chose them God made them
[36:55] that way God promised them what he would
[37:00] do for them
[37:01] if they would just do what he said only
[37:03] time there's real got in trouble was he
[37:05] quit they quit doing what God said amen
[37:08] so here we are we coming to the Passover
[37:11] and you know what this is a serious time
[37:13] because this is going to mean death a
[37:17] lot of other things where you know that
[37:19] were bugs and they were this and they
[37:21] were that and they were frogs and all
[37:22] these different things but now we come
[37:25] down to a life there's gonna have to be
[37:28] a life given it's become a very serious
[37:32] time even in our life
[37:34] as of right now this day amen so let's
[37:40] go to Exodus
[37:43] excuse me chapter 12 and let's begin to
[37:48] read now I want you to realize and look
[37:52] at your if you want to look at your
[37:53] chart for just a second don't pull it up
[37:55] yet but just look down glance down at
[37:57] your chart when we get started with this
[38:00] Passover is a feast it is different from
[38:06] unleavened bread but all through the
[38:08] Bible it is included in the feast of
[38:12] unleavened bread everybody got that same
[38:14] am because you're gonna look at we're
[38:16] gonna read some scriptures in the New
[38:17] Testament if we ever get to them in the
[38:19] New Testament where it talks about the
[38:21] feast of unleavened
[38:22] but it started because remember that
[38:25] Passover they had to still eat
[38:27] unleavened bread okay so listen there's
[38:30] two groups in Israel today that keep
[38:35] seven days and another group that keeps
[38:38] eight days which is including that day
[38:40] of Passover everybody got that because
[38:42] the Bible tells us we'll read when we
[38:44] get done leavened bread that after the
[38:46] day of Passover which will be the 15th
[38:48] day of the month it's when you start
[38:49] seven days of feast but now you'll see
[38:52] in the in the New Testament as it come
[38:55] down through time they started
[38:56] celebrating Passover it would say the
[38:59] feast of unleavened bread beginning at
[39:01] Passover so I don't want you get
[39:03] confused okay okay all right
[39:06] and you look at your chart afraid of you
[39:09] already confused tell me that was my
[39:14] first girlfriend long time ago okay well
[39:23] let's go let's go to this real slow the
[39:27] Bible - I know brother right I know but
[39:31] there's always one Passover with no look
[39:37] really honestly I what everybody
[39:38] understand this don't anybody be lost so
[39:41] look let's read this and then I'll show
[39:43] you what's going on this month shall be
[39:45] unto you the beginning of months what's
[39:46] the first day of the Jewish listen to me
[39:49] religious calendar those have you been
[39:52] downstairs I ought to know this Nissen
[39:54] are a bib or you got to say March April
[39:58] because now listen I know lot of you
[40:02] shaking here we've been over this before
[40:03] but I want to break it down a little bit
[40:05] more they do not have physical calendars
[40:10] in Israel even today we're in like the
[40:14] fifty seven hundred and fiftieth day of
[40:15] the since the beginning of time that's
[40:18] the way they count it but the way they
[40:20] count it it is a lunar cycle I got that
[40:25] the priest walks out they see a sliver
[40:27] of moon they say okay we can start the
[40:29] next month if they walk out at the end
[40:31] of the first month and they look and
[40:32] they do not see that sliver or the full
[40:34] moon or whichever it is
[40:36] they say nope we gotta have another
[40:37] month because the because that's why we
[40:40] have Lee piers you know why we have leap
[40:44] years ok freedom the reason we don't
[40:47] have lead we have leap years oh I'll
[40:50] come over here the reason we have leap
[40:52] years it's what happened though now look
[40:56] we know one thing let's go back it's may
[40:59] take a while glad I got Wednesday no
[41:02] listen listen no I
[41:04] that's not funny I want you to
[41:05] understand I want everybody to
[41:06] understand I want everybody to be on the
[41:07] same level ok so what happened when the
[41:10] flood came you're sitting close to
[41:12] register witness when when the flood
[41:14] came what happened to the world it got
[41:16] kilt it off kids you know in school the
[41:21] earth is not setting on its axis it's so
[41:25] many degrees off so it wobbles that's
[41:28] why we have spring summer fall and
[41:30] winter because there are tilts the sun's
[41:35] up here the earth tilts away we have
[41:38] thank you so anyway so that's why that
[41:42] but now as we keep these times as it
[41:47] wobbles what happened was on into the
[41:52] middle light from BC to AD you have
[41:55] Julian calendar Gregorian calendar Aaron
[41:58] can fill you in on all that but this is
[42:00] this is just telling you why we do what
[42:02] we do what happened is if you keep
[42:04] everything solid by calendar these
[42:09] spring feasts were beginning to be in
[42:11] the middle of the summer then they begin
[42:14] to be in the winter so one either either
[42:18] Pope Gregory or one of the or Julius
[42:20] Caesar one added so many days to the
[42:23] calendar to bring it all the way back
[42:25] this is true to bring it all the way
[42:28] back to put everything in April in the
[42:31] spring they got that same n then you
[42:35] come up with a Gregorian calendar and
[42:37] that right to what Julian was numbers
[42:40] Gregorian calendar is our 31 30 29 now
[42:44] we know what prophets said about that
[42:46] remember when the earth was standing
[42:48] straight up before the flood
[42:50] it was 30 days to a month everything was
[42:52] running right on cater 30 days every
[42:56] month got it but now it wobbles
[43:00] so it started putting the day's over
[43:01] into the summertime well they reversed
[43:03] it back and Pope Gregory or Julian won
[43:07] one of the two added 365 and 1/4 days
[43:11] that's why every four years there's a
[43:13] leap year you have one extra day and
[43:15] free - let me tell you you know how to
[43:17] figure out that out and the election
[43:20] year is presidential election year is
[43:22] always on a leap year it gives the
[43:24] politicians one more day to lie to us
[43:35] it's kind of funny that it happens that
[43:37] way but so that so now the calendar
[43:40] states back we're it supposed to be
[43:42] everybody okay with that so that not
[43:45] really I mean it would it started with
[43:47] that
[43:47] sure enough the spring feasts were
[43:49] beginning to be in the summertime
[43:50] they're like we can't celebrate these
[43:52] feast Easter can't be in July so they
[43:57] set the calendar back and started doing
[43:59] 365 and the fourth day that we now live
[44:03] under now when we go back to the
[44:05] Millennium remember remember what we're
[44:07] going to do everything is going to come
[44:08] right back up the new city we're not
[44:11] going to have a wobbly earth in the new
[44:12] city that's going to be perfection we're
[44:15] gonna have 360 days we're going to what
[44:19] go back to the original and then so this
[44:22] month shall be in you the beginning of
[44:24] month so God told Moses your first month
[44:29] is going to be a bib Nissen are and and
[44:34] listen it's March April because remember
[44:36] what I said it wobbles back and forth
[44:38] it's determined on the moon even Israel
[44:41] now over there now their calendars are
[44:44] according to the moon it's called a
[44:47] lunar calendar alright so because they
[44:50] depend on that when it comes the priests
[44:52] come out and they see okay there's
[44:54] there's too much moon showing we need to
[44:56] have another month because it keeps
[44:58] everything right here you have spring
[45:01] feast they have to be in the spring
[45:04] okie-dokie they can't be in the fall
[45:06] they have to be in the spring so God set
[45:10] this up see when God sets it up it's
[45:13] perfect
[45:14] so this month shall be at the beginning
[45:16] of months but now remember also I don't
[45:20] know if it's on that or not but now the
[45:23] Jewish civil calendar starts in October
[45:29] so it's different you got to remember
[45:34] we're talking about the lunar or the
[45:40] religious calendar of Israel from now on
[45:43] we're gonna talk about the religious
[45:44] calendar of Israel which starts God told
[45:47] them to start it in March April are a
[45:50] bit so that will be the first month of
[45:53] their year so if you got you a little
[45:55] thing right here you got your little
[45:56] paper if you want to pull it pull it up
[45:58] now brother Joseph we can
[46:00] they're so good back there look at this
[46:02] boom that's your first month missing
[46:06] right here what happens is is each one
[46:09] of these come to a place now right here
[46:11] at the end of the year the priests come
[46:13] out and if there's a difference there's
[46:15] a sliver of the moon left I mean if
[46:17] there's a big part of the moon left when
[46:19] it's supposed to come to this day here
[46:21] they say nope they add another month
[46:23] some there some of the years have 13
[46:26] months but it keeps all this from doing
[46:28] this keeps it from shifting because you
[46:32] know what God said these are right this
[46:34] is where I want these feasts and that's
[46:36] where I want those feast I don't want
[46:38] them here and here he wants them in the
[46:43] spring
[46:43] what where everything's growing and he
[46:46] wants them in the fall where everything
[46:48] is harvested there May got that same man
[46:51] now I don't know who in the world went
[46:53] in the pastor study it made every one of
[46:55] these things set sideways I'm gonna whip
[46:58] them you can't set them up nowhere so
[47:03] you just have to lay it down so right
[47:06] here look here's Passover we're gonna
[47:08] read on the 14th day of the month all
[47:13] right Fred you got that okay the next
[47:17] day is
[47:17] the 15th that's when you start on lemon
[47:19] bread but but taking Passover we're
[47:24] going to read it here you start eating
[47:26] unleavened bread here Passover is one
[47:29] day unleavened bread is seven or eight
[47:33] days ever how you want to you want if
[47:34] you want to include Passover that's
[47:37] eight days everybody got that if you
[47:39] don't it's seven days and we're gonna
[47:41] read here in the Bible then you have the
[47:44] feast of firstfruits which is right
[47:48] after that so we'll get into those a
[47:50] little bit later but we got to get it
[47:51] passover first all right here we go
[47:52] Exodus 12 verse 1 let's go let's get
[47:55] this done and the Lord speaking them
[47:59] Aaron in Moses and the land of Egypt
[48:02] saying this month excuse me shall be
[48:04] unto you the beginning of months it
[48:05] shall be the first month of the year to
[48:07] you missing a bit it's too different but
[48:11] it's all the same march/april speak into
[48:14] all the congregation of Israel saying in
[48:16] the tenth day of this month now I want
[48:20] to correct something that I said last
[48:23] week in haste and the youngest lady in
[48:28] this building corrected me she's 92
[48:31] years old
[48:33] thank you sister clean in 93 years old I
[48:36] didn't want to add that one in there but
[48:38] I said you have to put up the lamb 14
[48:41] days that's not true now brother Branham
[48:43] there is one quote where he says it but
[48:45] remember he's flying through all this
[48:47] trying to teach us these things but God
[48:49] told them in the tenth day of this month
[48:53] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[48:57] now they're very good with that so the
[49:00] tenth day of a bib or Nissen you're
[49:03] gonna find you a lamb it has to be it
[49:07] has different criteria but I want you to
[49:09] realize something as we're reading this
[49:11] remember every house had to have a lamb
[49:18] okay every house this is an individual
[49:23] affair with God it's not a group thing
[49:26] no it's an individual affair with God
[49:28] speaking to the congregation of Israel
[49:30] saying
[49:31] in the tenth day of this month they
[49:33] shall take to them every man a lamb
[49:35] according to the house of their fathers
[49:37] a lamb for a house and if the household
[49:41] be too little for the lamb in other
[49:44] words you got to eat this thing this
[49:45] lambs got to be consumed you can't have
[49:48] any leftover so they gathered several
[49:50] together this is the natural story all
[49:53] right let him and his neighbor next into
[49:55] his house take it according to the
[49:56] number of souls every man according to
[49:59] his eating shall make your count for the
[50:01] lamb now look your lamb shall be without
[50:04] blemish here's where that just cleat or
[50:07] not we're talking about because you've
[50:08] got to keep it up until the fourteenth
[50:10] day so from the tenth day to the
[50:12] fourteenth day you've got to examine
[50:13] that lamb can't have a blemish can't
[50:18] have a broke leg can't have a sore it's
[50:22] gotta be a perfect lamb did we don't
[50:27] have one you're gonna see this man I
[50:31] mean you're gonna if you don't see this
[50:32] then lord help you get the baptism of
[50:34] the holy go because this will help you
[50:36] to see what God has done not for those
[50:38] people in the natural but what he's done
[50:40] for you spiritually and then your lamb
[50:43] shall be without blemish a male a
[50:46] firstborn you shall take it out from the
[50:50] Sheep or from the goats and you shall
[50:52] keep it up unto the fourteenth day of
[50:55] the same month and the whole Assembly of
[50:57] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[50:59] in the evening time they got that same
[51:04] AM and they shall take up the blood and
[51:07] strike it on the two side post what to
[51:10] side post and on the top to side posting
[51:16] on the upper door what are you making a
[51:18] cross a cross that's where you got to
[51:23] put the lamb on the cross and they shall
[51:27] take up the blood and strike it on the
[51:28] two side posting on the upper doorpost
[51:30] of the house wherein they shall eat it
[51:34] now I know if you've watched the Ten
[51:37] Commandments recently you'll remember
[51:41] this little guy has a little thing for
[51:44] this girl
[51:45] is always won in her story so he goes
[51:47] over runs over to her house and he slaps
[51:49] some blood on her that don't work that's
[51:55] not what happened you got to put the
[51:57] blood over your doorpost you can't put
[52:00] it over your neighbors in other words
[52:03] you can't give your Holy Ghost to
[52:04] somebody else you got to have it for
[52:05] yourself and you can't have it because
[52:07] brother nails got it and you can't have
[52:09] it goes hey man you shall take of the
[52:12] blood and strike it on the two side post
[52:14] it on the upper doorpost of the house
[52:15] wherein they shall eat and they shall
[52:17] eat the flesh in that night jesus said
[52:18] eat my and drink my okay they shall eat
[52:23] the flesh in that night roast with fire
[52:24] and unleavened bread so that's where you
[52:27] begin to start eating unleavened bread
[52:29] what is unleavened bread unleavened
[52:31] bread is bread without a riser or
[52:33] without yeast in it we'll talk about
[52:37] that next time because there's a little
[52:39] there's a little key in there about
[52:41] unleavened bread and that's why we take
[52:43] unleavened bread and wine not grape
[52:48] juice and not corn bread our bread bread
[52:51] we take unleavened bread made by holy
[52:53] hands without leaven and that's what we
[52:55] take with our communion because it
[52:57] commemorates the body and blood of the
[52:58] Lord and Oh while I'm thinking about do
[53:03] you want to have communion next Sunday
[53:04] with brother Andrew here or do you want
[53:06] wait til the next Sunday well the next
[53:10] Sunday okay we'll have communion the
[53:11] second Sunday in July okay not the first
[53:14] Sunday we always have it the first
[53:15] Sunday of the month and you shall eat
[53:18] the flesh in that night roast with fire
[53:19] and unleavened bread and with bitter
[53:21] herbs this is not gonna be a real fancy
[53:23] meal because something's gonna die but
[53:29] you got to eat a night of it raw nor
[53:30] sodden at all with water but roast with
[53:33] fire is head with its legs and with the
[53:35] pertinence thereof another's words
[53:36] everything you shall let nothing of it a
[53:38] riot remain until the morning and that
[53:40] which remaineth of it that's why we burn
[53:42] the communion bread when we get finished
[53:44] with communion I take what's left over
[53:46] to my house and I burn it to a crisp
[53:48] all right because you don't want to hold
[53:51] anything over remember what happened the
[53:53] man in the in the in the Land of Israel
[53:55] when they held it over the next day
[53:57] what did it become had wiggle tails in
[53:59] it it became sour and would make you
[54:02] sick
[54:02] in other words like the Word of God you
[54:04] can't hold it over from a day passed you
[54:07] get a new revelation every day amen and
[54:11] you shall let nothing of it remain until
[54:12] the morning and that which remaineth

[54:15] with fire and thus shall you eat it with
[54:19] your loins girded know how to dress your
[54:23] shoes on your feet and your staff in
[54:25] your hand because we remember when you
[54:29] receive this lamb and you receive this
[54:33] Passover you're getting out of Egypt

[54:47] show you eat it with your loins girded
[54:48] your shoes on your feet your staff in
[54:50] your hand and you shall eat it in haste
[54:51] it is the Lord's Passover for I will
[54:56] pass through the land of Egypt this
[54:57] night and will smite all the firstborn
[54:58] in the land of Egypt both man and beast
[55:00] and against all the gods of Egypt I will
[55:04] execute judgment

[55:10] shall be to you for a token upon your
[55:12] house is where you are and when I see
[55:15] the Blood I will pass over you and the
[55:19] plates shall not be upon you to destroy
[55:21] you when I smite this earth and this day
[55:25] shall be unto you for a memorial let me
[55:30] remember the day you got born again
[55:32] there's your Passover there's your
[55:34] Memorial and this day she'll be into you
[55:36] for a memorial and you shall keep it as
[55:38] a feast to the Lord throughout your
[55:39] generations and you shall keep a feast
[55:41] by an ordinance forever listen folks
[55:47] here sits a group of people that have
[55:50] been in bondage for 430 years there had
[55:54] been all kind of plagues and and you
[55:57] know the devil said I've done with you
[55:59] leave then about 15 minutes later the
[56:02] devil says no get back in here where
[56:04] you're supposed to be because that's
[56:07] what the devil does
[56:09] he lets you get or knock their little
[56:11] clothes and he says no come back but
[56:14] this day when something died for your
[56:18] sin when something died and the blood
[56:22] was put over the doorpost as a token
[56:25] that something happened all folks
[56:27] grace came on the scene grace brought
[56:31] Israel a prophet grace brought Israel an
[56:35] angel that was going to lead them
[56:37] through the journey that they had and
[56:39] grace provided a lamb when I see the
[56:45] Blood I will pass over you I can't die
[56:52] he died for me oh what a great thing and
[56:58] this was before law remember grace came
[57:01] before law because they didn't get the
[57:03] law to the wilderness in acts 19 this
[57:05] was grace before law ever came God give
[57:08] them grace provided them away out
[57:11] provided them a prophet for what a
[57:13] prophet for instruction an angel for a
[57:17] God and a lamb to take away your sin is
[57:24] that not what happened today is that no
[57:26] one happened today God did the same
[57:29] identical thing the Holy Ghost to God
[57:31] you gave us a prophet in the end time
[57:32] according to Malachi for just straighten
[57:34] up all the loose ends and get us all
[57:36] straightened back up and then he left
[57:38] the scene and what'd he do he left us
[57:41] the message he left us the Word of God
[57:45] so let's go through these little points
[57:47] right here real quick so this is some of
[57:51] the bullet points we've talked about but
[57:52] look the first month is a bitter Nissen
[57:55] which is March April
[57:56] you put the lamb up on the tenth day of
[57:59] the month if I got that say man night
[58:04] and as mince it's cleaner we're talking
[58:07] about I should have known it went in 14
[58:09] days because four days before Jesus
[58:13] Christ was crucified he wrote into the
[58:18] temple
[58:19] he said Here I am I'm the perfect lamb
[58:24] and when he walked into the temple
[58:26] brother Luiz he didn't walk in and go
[58:28] hey how y'all doing he said you can't do
[58:31] this in my daddy's house you don't know
[58:34] the chronology of that this is when it
[58:36] happens right before he's crucified he
[58:38] walks in the temple to declare he is the
[58:40] Paschal Lamb and they're out there
[58:42] selling doves and selling pigeons and
[58:44] selling this and selling that for the
[58:47] Passover that was coming oh he was mad
[58:51] let's say he was angry let's say he
[58:55] planted a rope and drove him out of the
[58:56] temple and I'm always like Daddy I don't
[58:59] believe he hit one animal there because
[59:01] he hit the real animals and it was the
[59:03] people then priest it should have known
[59:05] different all right and you're supposed
[59:09] to kill this lamb win in the evening
[59:13] each home had to kill a lamb everybody
[59:17] got that they had to eat unleavened
[59:21] bread it had to be a Lamb of the
[59:24] firstborn they had to be ready to go and
[59:28] there had to be blood over the door now
[59:33] listen any of that done wrong meant
[59:40] death any of that done wrong meant death
[59:46] that's why you and I must do what the
[59:48] Word of God says it's written there it's
[59:53] for us to see and it's for us to
[59:55] understand and if they did that guess
[59:58] what they stayed alive the next day but
[1:00:00] if they didn't guess what they died it
[1:00:02] didn't matter it didn't you know what if
[1:00:04] when if you had a rebel kids or not a
[1:00:06] rebel kid but you had a rebel family it
[1:00:08] says I'm not doing anything my prophet
[1:00:11] says I'm not doing anything a preacher
[1:00:16] says I'm gonna live my own way my own
[1:00:20] life well according to that you died the
[1:00:24] next day
[1:00:26] maybe not naturally but spiritually dead
[1:00:29] hey man
[1:00:32] so now let's real quick I want to jump
[1:00:36] to the New Testament to the Book of Luke
[1:00:40] to show you that Passover is one of the
[1:00:45] feast days but it's also included in the
[1:00:49] feast of unleavened bread just to be
[1:00:51] real quick right here watch Luke 22 this
[1:00:54] was in the time of Jesus says now the
[1:00:57] feast of unleavened bread drew nigh
[1:00:59] which is called the Passover everybody
[1:01:02] got that
[1:01:03] so it's included it's separate but it's
[1:01:08] included and the chief priests and
[1:01:10] scribes saw how they might kill him for
[1:01:13] they feared the people now what are they
[1:01:14] coming up to they're coming up to that
[1:01:16] Passover which was on what Friday also
[1:01:20] remember you got this listen Jewish days
[1:01:24] are not midnight to midnight everybody
[1:01:31] got that
[1:01:32] Jewish days started six o'clock in the
[1:01:35] afternoon or in the evening is six
[1:01:38] o'clock from 6 o'clock to 6 o'clock is
[1:01:41] their day and why is that I told you
[1:01:46] always Sunday thank you and the book of
[1:01:49] Genesis God said the evening and the
[1:01:51] morning is the first day so we got to
[1:01:55] stay in the Bible and we got to see that
[1:01:58] Jesus look at look at Luke 22 verse 8
[1:02:02] then came the day of unleavened bread
[1:02:04] when the Passover must be killed
[1:02:07] so the Passover is included in
[1:02:10] unleavened bread but you can't put it in
[1:02:13] the seven days of unleavened bread you
[1:02:14] got to make it the eight days Passover
[1:02:17] is one day because they killing it they
[1:02:19] evening time then you start the feast of
[1:02:21] unleavened bread that's seven days and
[1:02:25] he sent Peter and John saying going
[1:02:26] prepares to Passover that we may eat
[1:02:29] let's go to Luke 22 verse 15 and when
[1:02:32] the hour was come he sat down and the
[1:02:34] Twelve Apostles with him and they said
[1:02:37] unto Him with desire have I desired to
[1:02:40] eat this Passover with you before I
[1:02:43] suffer
[1:02:45] there's many times in the scripture that
[1:02:48] Jesus went to Passover because we'll get
[1:02:52] into a little bit later there was three
[1:02:54] great feast that every male child in
[1:02:57] Israel had to go to all right
[1:03:01] it was Passover unleavened bread
[1:03:04] Pentecost and Tabernacles in that
[1:03:09] strange Passover Pentecost anybody
[1:03:15] getting anything out of this and
[1:03:17] Tabernacles they had to come see that's
[1:03:21] why I see that we're brother branham
[1:03:23] tells us about Jesus when they caught
[1:03:26] him in the temple that was during the
[1:03:28] feast of Pentecost but they came in on
[1:03:31] the feast of Passover and they stayed
[1:03:32] the whole fifty days and remember they
[1:03:36] left because everybody listen don't get
[1:03:41] me wrong but you think about the world
[1:03:42] now well you know we you see the been
[1:03:46] especially out in the world you know you
[1:03:49] see a guy having a party at his house
[1:03:50] and everybody wants to come doesn't
[1:03:52] matter if you a family member
[1:03:53] well that's the same way with the
[1:03:55] Passover because during the Passover and
[1:03:57] all these different feasts everybody
[1:03:59] come Jews Greeks didn't matter either
[1:04:03] get free food and wine and let's just
[1:04:06] all go to the Passover that's what
[1:04:10] happened many many times but here Jesus
[1:04:12] is coming up to the hour that he's to be
[1:04:15] killed or the day before and he said
[1:04:18] with desire have I desired to eat this
[1:04:21] Passover he had celebrated Passover
[1:04:23] since he was a child
[1:04:25] and that I have told you many times
[1:04:27] before Jesus went to church what's your
[1:04:32] what's your problem
[1:04:33] Jesus went to church hey man for I'm
[1:04:37] saying to you I will not anymore eat
[1:04:38] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[1:04:41] kingdom of God because he was fixing to
[1:04:44] be the Passover lamb but with desire I
[1:04:48] have desired he had long from the day
[1:04:50] that he knew that he was going to be
[1:04:53] killed
[1:04:54] he had desired to eat that Passover meal
[1:04:57] because he knew
[1:04:58] if he didn't eat that he wouldn't go to
[1:05:00] Calvary but he knew he was gonna have to
[1:05:02] go to Calvary now he's right there at
[1:05:04] the Lord's Supper not the Lord's dinner
[1:05:07] you eat supper and evening just for
[1:05:11] those of you that think the middle of
[1:05:14] the day is supper our dinner is in the
[1:05:16] evening it is not it's called the Lord's
[1:05:18] Supper not the lord's dinner John 18 now
[1:05:25] look what happened here they'd already
[1:05:31] took Jesus and you got to remember that
[1:05:36] you got to follow this with me here real
[1:05:39] quick it will we'll get more into it as
[1:05:41] we do the other feast but remember Jesus
[1:05:44] had to be killed on Passover as
[1:05:46] everybody got that all right and
[1:05:52] Passover start there Dave started at 6
[1:05:54] o'clock in the afternoon all right so
[1:05:57] they ate the Lord's Supper Thursday
[1:06:00] evening then by the next morning it was
[1:06:03] already Passover time and that's where
[1:06:06] Jesus because watch this right here
[1:06:08] then led they led they Jesus from
[1:06:12] Caiaphas the conference was the high
[1:06:15] priest he was a Jew and remember you
[1:06:18] can't defile yourself sister Cleveland
[1:06:20] now we're talking a few minutes ago even
[1:06:21] in the Bible there was a group of people
[1:06:23] that had touched the dead man in the
[1:06:26] Bible and they come to Moses and Moses
[1:06:29] we can't do the Passover we're defiled
[1:06:30] God he went to God and God said ok I'm
[1:06:34] gonna give you some grace the next month
[1:06:36] on the fourteenth day of the month will
[1:06:38] be your Passover all right so like
[1:06:40] brother Dale said it's not just
[1:06:41] everything God just chopped no he gives
[1:06:43] grace to everybody all right amen
[1:06:46] then led they Jesus from Caiaphas into
[1:06:48] the Hall of judgment now where's the
[1:06:50] Hall of judgment that's pilot that's
[1:06:51] Gentile you don't defile yourself and it
[1:06:56] was early in other words it was the
[1:06:58] morning of Friday already started to
[1:07:01] Passover since the clock though but it
[1:07:02] was the morning of Friday they got that
[1:07:04] and they themselves went not into the
[1:07:07] judgment Hall lest they should be
[1:07:08] defiled but that they might eat the
[1:07:11] Passover
[1:07:12] so they couldn't they couldn't go to
[1:07:14] pilots Hall because that's the hall of
[1:07:17] Gentiles you don't go in there because
[1:07:19] you're defiled remember that they might
[1:07:21] eat the Passover
[1:07:25] and watch what happens is now Jesus
[1:07:31] they literally brothers and sisters
[1:07:35] listen to this they literally were
[1:07:38] killing a lamb in the temple while they
[1:07:43] hung the Lamb of God on the cross at the
[1:07:47] same time same day he fulfilled every
[1:07:52] scripture that's how blind Israel was
[1:07:59] and that's how bloodthirsty the world
[1:08:02] was is that they didn't care they just
[1:08:05] said hang him on a cross and they hung
[1:08:10] him on a cross while they were killing
[1:08:12] the Passover lamb the Lamb of God hey
[1:08:14] why did God render there was a big
[1:08:19] curtain over the over the Holy of Holies
[1:08:20] you couldn't see it nobody but one high
[1:08:22] priest could go back there now remember
[1:08:26] this will prove that man didn't do it
[1:08:29] God rent it from the top this thing was
[1:08:34] like 30 feet tall here in it from the
[1:08:36] top to the bottom you could say man to
[1:08:39] do it if you rent it from the bottom to
[1:08:40] the top but God rent the veil from the
[1:08:44] top to the bottom and as I like what
[1:08:46] brother Brown says he said surely they
[1:08:48] could look out the window of the temple
[1:08:50] and see the Lamb of God hanging at
[1:08:52] Calvary because God was going to show a
[1:08:55] witness that he sent the real lamb the
[1:09:01] real Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:09:04] of the world listen what the prophet of
[1:09:05] God says about him in witness in 1956
[1:09:08] many was witnesses of his day and it's
[1:09:11] crossed when he was dying the Pharisees
[1:09:13] they should have knowed what the word
[1:09:15] said the word gave witness that when he
[1:09:18] was killed on he was a Passover lamb
[1:09:20] killed at the Passover time he gave
[1:09:23] witness the word spoke of him when he
[1:09:25] healed
[1:09:26] the sick when he raised the dead when
[1:09:28] the lame leap like a heart it was the
[1:09:30] word oh my can you receive it it was the
[1:09:33] word giving witness that this is he
[1:09:35] who's been promised to the world the
[1:09:38] Savior the Messiah it gave witness to
[1:09:40] his deity that he was more than man the
[1:09:45] night that the seas hushed itself had
[1:09:47] rocked away like a crying baby hushed
[1:09:49] into mother's arm when he said peace be
[1:09:51] still it was giving way nature testify
[1:09:55] that he is deity none other than the
[1:09:59] creator himself not a mere man not a
[1:10:02] prophet but God manifested in flesh he
[1:10:06] was God that don't excite you Thank You
[1:10:18] Louise you and I have to come to the
[1:10:26] same place you have to though not take a
[1:10:31] lamb now you have to accept to the Lambs
[1:10:34] already by being crucified but you still
[1:10:39] got to do it in your house you can't do
[1:10:41] it in brother Donny's house or listen
[1:10:43] you got to do it in your house it is a
[1:10:44] private individual affair with God it's
[1:10:46] you and him no one else and listen if
[1:10:49] you ain't got the token applied what's
[1:10:52] gonna happen the death angel will come
[1:10:55] and carry you away amen so get into
[1:10:59] Christ that's brother Devils preaching
[1:11:02] this morning chosen in him listen there
[1:11:04] was a lot of people chosen of him Judas
[1:11:06] was chosen of Jesus but if you're chosen
[1:11:10] in him
[1:11:11] whatever he is that's what I am not too
[1:11:16] strong jesus said Lord I pray father I
[1:11:20] pray that they will be one as you and I
[1:11:24] are one
[1:11:27] how strong is that but here we come to
[1:11:31] the Passover and they killed this lamb
[1:11:34] and they ate it in haste and they got
[1:11:38] ready
[1:11:39] and when they walked that door out that
[1:11:41] door the next day they left Egypt and
[1:11:45] they didn't go back and I love what even
[1:11:50] poor Pharaoh he looks at Moses the day
[1:11:53] before and he said I won't see your face
[1:11:56] again and Moses turned around looked at
[1:11:59] him and said no you will not
[1:12:03] Amen because when they got across the
[1:12:06] sea and they look back and all those
[1:12:07] Egyptians were dead Moses looked at him
[1:12:10] he told him he said these Egyptians
[1:12:11] you've seen these sins these lies these
[1:12:14] things that you've done clap your hands
[1:12:17] somebody clap your hands good lord
[1:12:20] all these sins everything you see has
[1:12:22] been left in that seat let's see if
[1:12:25] God's forgetfulness never to be
[1:12:27] remembered again he will not bring up
[1:12:31] your past if somebody brings up your
[1:12:33] past it's the devil
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:35] and he's alive yes the father of it so
[1:12:44] the feast of Passover has one meaning
[1:12:49] but it also has another meaning the
[1:12:52] feast of Passover is included in
[1:12:55] communion will read that real quick so
[1:12:59] let's turn to well let's read first
[1:13:01] Corinthians what's this right here now
[1:13:07] Paul picks this up in the New Testament
[1:13:09] now we don't have to we don't have to go
[1:13:11] to the feast of passover anymore the day
[1:13:15] right God said when Jesus came he said
[1:13:19] there's not a day in other words there's
[1:13:21] no more day he was the Lord of the
[1:13:24] Sabbath and he's standing there telling
[1:13:25] them say look it's not a day the rest
[1:13:31] I'm telling you about is me so you get
[1:13:34] in Christ
[1:13:35] and as I've always said before why do we
[1:13:38] have to celebrate a great big thing
[1:13:40] called Easter we celebrate the
[1:13:43] resurrection every Sunday
[1:13:48] every Sunday reminds us there's a
[1:13:51] resurrection doesn't take Easter to do
[1:13:53] that Easter were something man put
[1:13:56] together your glorying is not good and
[1:13:58] you know the history behind that too
[1:14:00] don't you we do it's not good I start
[1:14:04] and all that yeah all that junk your
[1:14:07] glorying is not good no you're not that
[1:14:09] a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[1:14:10] purge out therefore the old leaven that
[1:14:13] you may be a new lump call yourself a
[1:14:15] lump I'm a new lump as you're 11 for
[1:14:21] even Christ our Passover is sacrificed
[1:14:24] for us therefore let us keep the feast
[1:14:28] no words not with old leaven neither
[1:14:31] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[1:14:33] sin but with the unleavened bread of
[1:14:36] sincerity and truth and that's why we're
[1:14:40] going to look in Exodus 12 verse 43 real
[1:14:42] quick and the Lord said unto Moses and
[1:14:45] Aaron this is the ordinance of the
[1:14:47] Passover now this is continuation if you
[1:14:48] go over to where we were this God brings
[1:14:52] it back up but what it watch what he
[1:14:54] tells them to do he's real specific
[1:14:56] because what happens is all the children
[1:14:58] of Israel are in Egypt now they're
[1:15:01] fixing the levees up and there's a big
[1:15:02] old mixed multitude coming behind them
[1:15:05] nobody got that believers make believers
[1:15:12] and unbelievers we're Bob where Bob at
[1:15:14] Bob in the back and the Lord said unto
[1:15:17] Moses and Aaron this is the ordinance of
[1:15:18] the Passover there shall no stranger eat
[1:15:22] thereof but every man's servant that is
[1:15:27] bought for money when thou has
[1:15:28] circumcised them what a circumcise the
[1:15:30] type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:33] then shall he eat thereof according to
[1:15:35] Abraham according to Abraham's faith God
[1:15:37] giving the sign of circumcision give you
[1:15:40] the sign of circumcision of the heart
[1:15:43] when you give you the baptism of the
[1:15:45] Holy Ghost then shall he eat thereof a
[1:15:47] foreigner and a hired servant in other
[1:15:49] words people strange to your to your
[1:15:52] walk of life your the Holy Ghost that
[1:15:54] you're living in and one house shall it
[1:15:57] be eaten
[1:15:58] thou shalt know
[1:15:59] carry forth out of the flesh abroad out
[1:16:02] of the house need to show you break a
[1:16:04] bone there up now there's were you know
[1:16:06] Jesus they said Jesus's bones were not
[1:16:07] broken they were gonna break his leg but
[1:16:09] he was already dead why because he gave
[1:16:11] up the ghost
[1:16:12] listen man didn't kill God he said into
[1:16:18] thy hands I commend my spirit he hung
[1:16:20] there for three hours for me and you
[1:16:26] that's what stirs my pot when you hear
[1:16:30] people say well I only want about a 15
[1:16:32] minute sermon I don't know one about a
[1:16:34] twenty minute sermon
[1:16:35] if God can hang on the cross for three
[1:16:37] hours I can sit and listen to somebody
[1:16:39] tell me about that God and if it takes
[1:16:42] all day let it be all day hey man I'll
[1:16:45] clap them now is it if you clap that
[1:16:48] means you ain't asleep in one house
[1:16:53] shall it be eaten is now shall not carry
[1:16:54] forth all of the flesh abroad in other
[1:16:57] words this is not this is sacred it's a
[1:17:01] sacred feasts just to say when we take
[1:17:03] communion it's sacred all the
[1:17:06] congregation of these Egypt Israel
[1:17:08] sorry shall keep it and when a stranger
[1:17:11] shall sojourn with thee and will keep
[1:17:13] the Passover to the Lord let all his
[1:17:15] males be circumcised and then let him
[1:17:18] come near and keep it and he shall be as
[1:17:20] one that is born in the land for no
[1:17:23] uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
[1:17:25] you're not supposed to take the
[1:17:27] communion without the baptism of the
[1:17:29] Holy Ghost because it's a commemoration
[1:17:32] that that man died on the cross and gave
[1:17:34] his body and his blood for me and you
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:37] so that's how serious God is no
[1:17:40] uncircumcised person shall eat there
[1:17:44] what a wonderful wonderful thing that
[1:17:48] God's give us now I want to give you
[1:17:50] this one more point then we'll close
[1:17:52] during the time of Passover remember
[1:17:55] that was on a Friday you got to have him
[1:18:00] crucified on Passover he has to be
[1:18:03] killed and listen the Bible tells us and
[1:18:06] I didn't bring it that they were
[1:18:07] hurrying up the process that's why we're
[1:18:12] going to try to bro
[1:18:13] his legs because why at six o'clock the
[1:18:18] feast of unleavened bread start but
[1:18:19] remember it was a high Sabbath their
[1:18:22] Sabbath is on Saturday remember
[1:18:24] everybody got this so they had to get
[1:18:27] him off the cross before 6 o'clock
[1:18:29] because there's no servile work done the
[1:18:32] next day because it was a double no no
[1:18:34] to do anything number one it was a
[1:18:36] Sabbath number two it was unleavened
[1:18:38] bread so they call it a high Sabbath
[1:18:41] which means that a feast day fell on the
[1:18:45] same day if they would have left Jesus
[1:18:47] on the cross at 6:10 he'd have had to
[1:18:51] hung there until Monday and that would
[1:18:53] have broke ever scripture that was there
[1:18:55] because Monday they went back to work
[1:18:56] again but they still did unleavened
[1:18:58] bread but remember he had to represent
[1:19:01] all the feast so here's the feast of
[1:19:03] Passover they killed the lamb Christ
[1:19:04] died on the cross before 6 o'clock six
[1:19:07] o'clock started a feast of unleavened
[1:19:08] bread
[1:19:09] what is unleavened bread no leaven this
[1:19:12] thing Jesus wasn't in his body on
[1:19:16] Saturday he was in spirit form and went
[1:19:23] to the souls in prison preached to them
[1:19:25] Oh Lord no I anybody would yeah his body
[1:19:29] was laying there dead dead as a hammer
[1:19:32] yeah dead well I was just an old
[1:19:38] southern expression dead as a hammer
[1:19:39] somebody was laying there dead but his
[1:19:42] soul was still working so while they
[1:19:48] were eating unleavened bread with
[1:19:50] sorrowing
[1:19:51] and no leaven the leaven of the Lord was
[1:19:55] laying in the tomb and the unleavened
[1:20:00] bread went to hell you know you don't
[1:20:08] have to go to hell but one time and if
[1:20:13] you're in him I was in him on the cross
[1:20:16] right if you're born again that life the
[1:20:20] eternal life that was in that man on the
[1:20:22] cross I was in there
[1:20:28] so I have already been to hell I don't
[1:20:32] have to go again I've done been one time
[1:20:35] it has no hold on a Christian this great
[1:20:43] thing called death and this great thing
[1:20:45] called hell that everybody scared up
[1:20:48] been there done that
[1:20:51] got scars for it but when Jesus Christ
[1:20:55] came up out of that tomb on the eighth
[1:20:58] day or the first day of the week there's
[1:21:03] you feast the firstfruits he was the
[1:21:06] first one out of the ground the first
[1:21:08] one to resurrect but we gonna get into
[1:21:12] that cuz we got to break it down we're
[1:21:13] not we don't went way ahead of ourselves
[1:21:14] now mm-hmm
[1:21:16] but we got unleavened bread so Jesus
[1:21:18] fulfilled if you look on your on your
[1:21:20] chart there you'll see and just just
[1:21:22] take it home and study it look at it and
[1:21:25] let's look at it one more time both Joe
[1:21:27] pulls up and then we'll musicians come
[1:21:29] after we do this if you don't mind it's
[1:21:34] kind of interesting too
[1:21:35] have you ever thought about this you
[1:21:38] remember I know that Joseph and Mary had
[1:21:40] to go to Jerusalem to be tact to be
[1:21:44] counted or to be taxed but remember they
[1:21:46] couldn't find a place to sleep could it
[1:21:50] have been they were celebrating the
[1:21:53] feast of Passover and the place was
[1:21:56] crowded because remember he was born in
[1:22:00] April Jesus Christ was not born on
[1:22:02] Christmas night we know that lambs are
[1:22:06] not born in December they're born in
[1:22:08] April Sophie was born in April and
[1:22:15] crucified in April he was in that
[1:22:17] Passover the whole high
[1:22:21] but Passover which is call and that is
[1:22:24] pronounced peace suck like a thug P sock
[1:22:29] it's Passover it's on the 14th day
[1:22:31] that's when the lamb is killed the Lambs
[1:22:33] not killed on this day the Lambs killed
[1:22:36] on the 14th day but you do begin one
[1:22:39] more time you begin the feast of
[1:22:41] unleavened bread on the 14th because you
[1:22:45] eat unleavened bread it's part of it
[1:22:47] that's the eight days but we're gonna
[1:22:49] get an unleavened bread because God told
[1:22:51] them seven days Saturday or that that
[1:22:55] Sabbath that Saturday you do no servile
[1:22:57] work then you can work but you still
[1:23:00] gotta eat unleavened bread and then the
[1:23:01] last day is a holy convocation the
[1:23:05] seventh day and then Lord we're gonna
[1:23:09] get into something when we get into the
[1:23:10] feast of Pentecost so that's exactly the
[1:23:14] day that Christ came back into people
[1:23:16] digs a day and guess what now Jesus
[1:23:24] fulfilled all these feasts while he was
[1:23:27] on earth he will not be on earth when he
[1:23:33] falls when these are fulfilled the Feast
[1:23:36] of Trumpets the Feast of Atonement and
[1:23:41] the Feast of Tabernacles is from me and
[1:23:45] you to fulfill because now Christ has
[1:23:49] amorphic himself from the Lamb of God
[1:23:53] that takes away the sin of the world -
[1:23:55] now he has come inside of me in you and
[1:23:58] he has made us kings and priests he has
[1:24:01] made us eternal we're just as eternal as
[1:24:06] guardian oh I don't know about that
[1:24:09] brother wait Romans 8 says Romans 8 says
[1:24:14] that we're heirs and joint heirs with
[1:24:18] Jesus Christ now what does that mean
[1:24:22] whatever he gets we get
[1:24:27] musicians come let's stand to our feet
[1:24:31] whatever he is we are
[1:24:36] the feast of Passover with a solemn time
[1:24:39] folks it literally meant life or death
[1:24:48] literally to them it meant life or death
[1:24:53] literally meant you said why no it means
[1:24:59] life and death to you - it means life
[1:25:02] and death to you also you and I must
[1:25:06] partake of what that lamb did before the
[1:25:09] foundation of the world oh yeah oh yeah
[1:25:12] he was slain in God's mind he was slain
[1:25:13] before the foundation world that's what
[1:25:15] your Bible says but he had to come down
[1:25:17] here physically do it you know why to
[1:25:19] show the devil that he meant what he
[1:25:22] said he meant he wasn't gonna send
[1:25:25] another person down here to die he was
[1:25:27] gonna come down here south let's say
[1:25:32] your song oh you gotta be kidding me
