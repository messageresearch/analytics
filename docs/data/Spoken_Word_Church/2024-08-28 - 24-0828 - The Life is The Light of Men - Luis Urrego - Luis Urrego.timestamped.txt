[14:29] John chapter
[14:32] 1 John chapter 1 and I want to talk this
[14:35] evening I want to speak about the life
[14:37] is the light of man the life is the
[14:41] light of man praise the Lord and I
[14:44] somewhat want to kind of piggyback on on
[14:47] what I was speaking about on Sunday
[14:49] morning if you haven't heard that that
[14:54] uh that Sunday school lesson uh I
[14:57] encourage you to do so
[14:59] but um we just kind of kind of piggy
[15:02] back on that but just kind of take it
[15:03] from a a different angle amen we want to
[15:06] talk about uh about the light you know
[15:09] and usually when we read John chapter 1
[15:11] you know we we we we talk about the
[15:14] godhead and and we talk about uh you
[15:17] know Jesus Christ creating all things
[15:20] and of course all that is true but I
[15:23] just want I just wanted to uh break it
[15:26] down on a specific thing that the Lord
[15:27] showed me I I guess the Lord showed me
[15:30] this afternoon about the light amen so
[15:33] let's just let's just go to the Lord in
[15:34] prayer our heavenly father we thank you
[15:36] Lord for the opportunity that we have to
[15:39] open back the pages of your word and
[15:41] that we are gathered here Lord Jesus
[15:44] father God not to Feast on the word of a
[15:46] man but Lord to Feast on you father God
[15:49] lord we want to be more like you you are
[15:51] the son of man Lord and and the bride
[15:54] Lord Jesus father is the son of man and
[15:57] father God in this hour Lord Jesus
[15:59] because we're part of you Lord we have
[16:01] father just as much Lord God uh
[16:05] everything father God belongs to us
[16:07] because Lord you've given it to us Lord
[16:09] Jesus we we are we we are join heirs and
[16:13] coair with you Lord God and so Heavenly
[16:16] Father we just pray Lord that you would
[16:18] just have your way here this evening
[16:19] Lord meet all needs amongst us and just
[16:22] father God speak to our hearts and help
[16:25] us to receive something from you Lord
[16:27] God forgive us for all of our sins sins
[16:29] cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness
[16:32] and we just kind of we just commit
[16:34] ourselves now into your hands Lord and
[16:36] we ask these things Lord in Jesus
[16:38] Christ's name amen praise the Lord Jesus
[16:41] amen John chapter 1 and the brothers can
[16:44] bring it up there and we'll just read to
[16:47] verse four and then I'll have you be
[16:49] seated it says in the beginning was the
[16:51] word and the Word was with God and the
[16:55] Word was God the same was in the
[16:59] beginning with God all things were made
[17:03] by him and without him was not anything
[17:07] made that was made in him was life and
[17:13] the life was the light of man praise the
[17:16] Lord and so that's where I got the title
[17:18] from and I chose the title the life is
[17:21] the light of man because I believe that
[17:23] life is still the light of man praise
[17:26] God and it's interesting that you know
[17:28] the the the Bible doesn't say there you
[17:30] know the light was the life of man
[17:33] praise the Lord but the life was the
[17:35] light of man and I believe the reason
[17:38] the reason why is because you have to
[17:41] you have to show forth life amen in
[17:43] order for the ones receiving the life be
[17:46] able to walk in that light you see what
[17:48] I'm saying so so so it was life before
[17:52] light although we know that if it's just
[17:54] light and there's no value to the light
[17:57] amen then it just doesn't serve any
[17:59] purpose but if there's light amen that
[18:01] causes life to grow amen that's valuable
[18:04] light so therefore Jesus is life praise
[18:07] God we know he's the originator and the
[18:09] source of life and that is why he showed
[18:11] us life that's why that verse says in
[18:13] there that in him was life and the life
[18:17] was the light of man praise the Lord so
[18:20] with that you may have your seats praise
[18:22] God
[18:25] Amen so you know Jesus we know that he
[18:29] brought life and and that life you know
[18:32] we can tie it to Mercy and Grace first
[18:35] amen and it gave it gave man that the
[18:38] light the necessary light to light up
[18:41] the way praise the Lord Jesus amen I I I
[18:44] I needed mercy and Grace when I was out
[18:46] in the world shaped in iniquity sinning
[18:49] and and and and that that that is when I
[18:52] needed the most Grace in my life amen
[18:55] and and and and you know when you
[18:56] receive Grace amen when you receive re
[18:59] mercy and when you receive amen uh uh
[19:01] compassion amen that that's what draws
[19:04] you amen that's what draws you it draws
[19:07] you Amen to be able to walk in that
[19:09] light whereas if we don't receive that
[19:12] amen it keeps us away it causes us to it
[19:16] keeps us away it pushes us back praise
[19:18] God but that's what Jesus was amen so
[19:20] that light amen came forth first Amen in
[19:24] the Bible and and and and we see there
[19:26] that that that in in in in
[19:30] um in in in Genesis chapter 1 when we
[19:33] read uh we'll just read it here together
[19:35] real quick it says in Genesis chapter 1
[19:38] that in the beginning God created the
[19:40] Heaven and the
[19:41] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[19:45] void and darkness was upon the face of
[19:47] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[19:50] upon the face of the water in verse
[19:52] three it says and God said let there be
[19:55] light and there was light and you know
[19:58] that that light that is speaking about
[20:00] there is not the sun light it's not the
[20:02] moon light not the Stars light stars
[20:05] light but it was him himself amen it was
[20:08] the life of God Amen he is the
[20:11] originator of all life amen he is the
[20:14] light of the world the Bible says Hey
[20:16] praise God everything was created by Him
[20:18] and nothing that was created amen uh
[20:21] didn't didn't exist on its own didn't
[20:23] come about on its own praise God it was
[20:26] originated by him he is the originator
[20:28] of all life praise the Lord amen
[20:31] everything good everything bad there had
[20:33] to be a pharaoh and there had to be a a
[20:36] a Moses amen life Moses Pharaoh had just
[20:40] as much that life that came from God
[20:43] just as Moses did praise God but it was
[20:45] Moses amen that got had the word of God
[20:48] that caused him to walk in the light
[20:50] amen for his day praise God and so and
[20:53] so it's interesting amen that everywhere
[20:55] that you see in in in John chapter 1
[20:58] when we're reading
[20:59] John chapter 1 and it helps you to
[21:01] understand it better is when you're
[21:02] looking at it like this when you when if
[21:05] if you're reading John chapter 1 it says
[21:08] in the beginning was the word so you put
[21:11] in Jesus Christ right there amen amen I
[21:14] if the brothers could bring those
[21:15] scriptures up and it could help us Amen
[21:17] in the beginning was Jesus Christ amen
[21:21] and Jesus Christ was with God and Jesus
[21:25] Christ was God right where did
[21:29] in the beginning who created the Heaven
[21:31] and the Earth amen Jesus Christ amen God
[21:35] praise amen praise the Lord now in in
[21:37] verse two the same or Jesus Christ was
[21:41] in the beginning with God that's why he
[21:44] could say that I I I I come from God and
[21:47] I go back to God that's why when he was
[21:49] going to die when he was dying he said I
[21:52] must go back to to the father Amen in
[21:55] other words to that position praise God
[21:57] it's the same God all the time amen
[21:59] there's no no three persons there's no
[22:02] two persons amen it's the same God Amen
[22:04] putting on a different mask depending on
[22:07] the dispensation or what he needs to do
[22:09] amen amen praise God all things now
[22:12] verse three all things were made by
[22:16] Jesus Christ and without Jesus Christ
[22:19] was not anything made that was made in
[22:23] him or Jesus Christ was life and the
[22:26] life was the light of man amen praise
[22:29] the lord we can uh go down to and the
[22:32] light verse 5 and the light shineth in
[22:34] darkness and the Darkness comprehend it
[22:37] not there was a man sent from God whose
[22:38] name was John the same came for a
[22:41] witness to Bear witness of the Jesus
[22:44] Christ that all men through Jesus Christ
[22:47] might believe kind of a little bit
[22:49] different when you read it this way it
[22:51] makes it even more personal right he was
[22:54] not that light or that Jesus Christ but
[22:57] was sent to bear witness of that Jesus
[23:00] Christ he was talking about John that
[23:02] was the true light or Jesus Christ which
[23:06] lith every man that cometh into the
[23:09] world so we could be here the rest of
[23:11] the time reading it that way but that is
[23:13] exactly how what it is it kind of helps
[23:15] when you put in Jesus Christ wherever it
[23:17] says word wherever it says him amen
[23:20] praise the Lord and so maybe you and
[23:23] your your children can go back home and
[23:24] read that whole chapter that way and
[23:27] it'll just maybe be more impactful to
[23:29] them now and when we skip down to verse
[23:33] 16 and it says there of that same
[23:36] chapter and of his Jesus Christ fullness
[23:39] of his fullness have all we received and
[23:42] Grace for Grace amen and then it says in
[23:46] verse 17 for the law was given by Moses
[23:51] but Grace but amen but God but Grace and
[23:55] Truth came by Jesus Christ am amen
[23:59] praise the Lord Jesus so that is where
[24:00] the grace comes from amen it comes from
[24:03] the Lord Jesus Christ amen we know that
[24:06] that in the in the days of Moses amen as
[24:09] the children left Egypt and God really
[24:12] what he wanted to do is deal with the
[24:14] people through Mercy through Grace Amen
[24:18] on on on a uh on that basis amen but the
[24:23] people amen as they were walking through
[24:25] the children through the through the
[24:26] Wilderness amen they they got caught up
[24:29] in in in Idol worshiping and and in all
[24:32] other things as a matter of fact while
[24:33] Moses was up on the mountain amen they
[24:36] were down they were down at the bottom
[24:38] of the mountain worshiping a golden calf
[24:41] they got tired of waiting for Moses they
[24:43] got tired of waiting uh uh what God what
[24:47] what was God doing up there with him
[24:49] amen and they wanted to get this program
[24:51] going so they thought that they could
[24:53] just do it on their own amen and so they
[24:55] asked Aaron hey make us a an idol that
[24:58] we can worship because they just come
[24:59] out of Egypt and Egypt they worship
[25:02] bulls and they worship frogs and they
[25:04] worship all kinds of things and and and
[25:06] so they they wanted they wanted to to to
[25:09] worship something something
[25:11] tangible cuz they couldn't see a
[25:13] tangible God they couldn't see but they
[25:15] saw his Works they saw his miracles and
[25:18] they see his Prophet but his Prophet is
[25:20] not on the scene and so they wanted to
[25:23] worship something tangible amen I just
[25:25] wonder if in this day and hour if it
[25:27] isn't like that with the even even
[25:29] amongst our ranks amen the prophet's
[25:31] gone off the scene amen he's not with us
[25:33] anymore and the people amen they're
[25:34] getting bored they're getting tired that
[25:37] the message isn't enough for them
[25:38] anymore they they want something
[25:40] tangible something that they can do amen
[25:42] praise God but God's giving us a word
[25:45] amen a message Amen in this hour that if
[25:47] you believe it by faith amen and take it
[25:49] in your life amen and apply that token
[25:52] in your life amen it'll change your life
[25:54] it'll change the life of your home it'll
[25:56] change the life of your family members
[25:57] it'll change you amen praise God if you
[26:00] take it amen no matter if the prophet's
[26:03] not on the scene
[26:05] anymore God is on the scene his people
[26:08] amen are still here praise the Lord and
[26:11] it then we don't need anything tangible
[26:13] but it's it's it's so amazing to me amen
[26:15] and and and you see this a lot amongst
[26:17] the Hispanic ranks they they want
[26:19] something tangible they want something
[26:20] they can touch something they can feel
[26:23] and something that they can uh or hit
[26:26] play something that they can do Amen to
[26:30] cause them amen to get closer to God and
[26:33] that's the Trap that the that that Satan
[26:35] has brought into them they left
[26:36] Catholicism but they gave to another
[26:39] Catholicism that's that's just the truth
[26:42] amen know some something that they can
[26:44] do amen praise God in the Catholic
[26:46] Church you know they're praying novenas
[26:48] and and walking on cobblestones on their
[26:50] knees and all kinds of things whipping
[26:53] themselves and the Philippines they Whi
[26:55] themselves and they they're bleeding
[26:56] some of them sacrifice or or crucify
[26:59] themselves on the cross they do all
[27:01] kinds of stuff to gain favor to God Amen
[27:04] when God has already done all that for
[27:06] them praise the Lord and he did it in
[27:08] real
[27:09] life he did it really for them praise
[27:12] the Lord it was their sins that put them
[27:14] there on that cross it was your sins
[27:16] that put him there on that cross for the
[27:18] love that he had for you and I praise
[27:20] the
[27:20] Lord and so this light amen that that
[27:23] that the children of Israel amen they
[27:25] got to they got finally God had to give
[27:28] give them a law and and so this law amen
[27:30] was was to be able to guide them to be
[27:33] able to differentiate their life amen
[27:36] from the peoples around them but it was
[27:38] also Amen to be able to give them to
[27:40] know what sin was Amen to know amen what
[27:44] was wrong and what was right amen praise
[27:46] God now in that law there was
[27:50] consequences amen if you broke the law
[27:53] there was consequences amen there that
[27:56] and so the law according to the New
[27:58] Testament amen it didn't show Grace it
[28:01] didn't show Mercy amen it was if you
[28:03] broke the law there was consequences
[28:06] amen so there was there was people amen
[28:09] people were probably just walking in
[28:11] fear amen because when there is law amen
[28:14] and and and that's all there is amen it
[28:16] causes you to walk in fear it causes you
[28:19] to walk amen subservient Amen to other
[28:21] people amen and not realizing amen that
[28:24] what you need is Grace amen amen because
[28:27] when you get Grace amen it causes you
[28:30] Amen to be a you want to walk in that in
[28:33] in in you want to love the Lord and
[28:35] follow his Commandments praise the Lord
[28:37] you want to do what's right when you
[28:40] obtain Grace when you obtain Mercy you
[28:43] will want to do to do because why that's
[28:46] what you can give back right I if I
[28:49] receive Grace from God I want to give my
[28:51] life back to God if he gave me so much
[28:53] grace if he gave me so much Mercy I just
[28:55] want to give my whole body as a living
[28:57] sacri rice amen praise the Lord and so
[29:01] the elements of light Saints it when
[29:04] when when God sent light amen he brought
[29:07] that light amen that caused all
[29:09] eventually caused things to to It
[29:12] produced uh animals It produced botney
[29:15] life It produced all these things amen
[29:17] and eventually it was being drawn to the
[29:20] light amen you know the the the the the
[29:23] the the the plants amen they they were
[29:26] being drawn to that life amen that would
[29:28] that came only by God Amen and so that's
[29:31] what light does Saints amen it's
[29:33] supposed to be drawing amen light is
[29:36] supposed to be drawn you and I your life
[29:38] is supposed to be drawing others Amen to
[29:41] who to you no to Jesus
[29:43] Christ it's supposed to be a draw or
[29:46] amen drawing others Amen to see where
[29:50] where is the source of that light amen
[29:52] and you and I are supposed to be light
[29:54] in this hour praise God and we're
[29:55] supposed to be walking in the light in
[29:57] this our amen and we can only walk in
[30:00] that light if we've received that life
[30:02] in US amen and he is the light he is the
[30:05] life he said I am the way the truth and
[30:08] the life amen no man comes to the father
[30:11] but by me amen and so we were reading
[30:14] here in Genesis chapter 1 here in in
[30:16] verse three it says and God said let
[30:18] there be light and there was light amen
[30:21] and we know that that light was life it
[30:24] was not the sun and it was not the moon
[30:26] and the stars because those came later
[30:28] in the chapter amen and then verse four
[30:30] it says and God saw the light that it
[30:32] was good and God divided the light from
[30:35] the darkness and so we were just reading
[30:37] there that in John 1:9 that that was the
[30:40] True Light who was that True Light amen
[30:42] it was the Lord Jesus Christ which lith
[30:45] every man that cometh into the world
[30:48] Amen so this life amen everybody lives
[30:52] by the by the by the life the life of
[30:54] God Amen remember when when Eve she said
[30:57] that I beg got a a man from the Lord
[30:59] when she had Cain and that she was
[31:01] saying something true amen but she
[31:04] thought it was just a she thought it in
[31:06] a different way amen that life did come
[31:08] from God everything that that was that
[31:11] was serpent seed amen came from God Amen
[31:14] because he is the source of life amen
[31:16] there's nothing that lives unless he was
[31:19] the one who thought it and spoke it
[31:21] first amen he is the source of life amen
[31:24] praise God so and then in verse 5 and
[31:27] God called the the light day and the
[31:29] Darkness he called night now we were
[31:31] just now talking about light that light
[31:34] we know that light attracts and it draws
[31:36] amen and we know that light it it
[31:39] symbolizes it often symbolizes
[31:41] positivity guidance hope and safety amen
[31:45] you know when you're walking down the
[31:47] street amen and you're walking in you
[31:50] know somewhere you generally don't want
[31:52] to go around where it's not well lit
[31:54] right I know you sisters don't want to
[31:57] go where some some Alleyway that is not
[31:59] very well lit amen there's something
[32:02] that's that's unsafe about that there
[32:04] there's something that doesn't that
[32:05] doesn't give you comfort about that amen
[32:08] but but when it's when there's light
[32:10] amen there's plenty of it amen it gives
[32:12] you confidence Amen to be able to to go
[32:15] in that in that Alleyway or to go
[32:17] wherever you need to go amen because
[32:18] there's light there's sufficient light
[32:20] if something goes on Amen I I can scream
[32:23] and somebody will see me amen somebody
[32:26] will be able to see what's going on
[32:28] there and and it gives you confidence
[32:30] amen and that's what light does Amen it
[32:32] draws you and it gives you confidence
[32:34] amen it gives you it gives you peace and
[32:37] it gives you a a satisfaction knowing
[32:40] that there's protection there amen
[32:43] praise God that's what that's what light
[32:45] does Amen right you know there is a
[32:48] there is something called
[32:50] phototaxis I was looking that and it's
[32:53] those insects amen it's the insects that
[32:55] are drawn to to to light is
[32:58] what I was reading is that the insects
[33:00] were those insects like the moths and
[33:03] the different bugs that you see that
[33:05] they are drawn you turn on your porch
[33:06] lot outside and and they're all over the
[33:08] place I mean look at out here while
[33:10] we're out there talking in the
[33:11] summertime and everybody's just
[33:12] constantly doing this you know hitting
[33:15] themselves but it's because those bugs
[33:19] originally were meant to be drawn and
[33:22] and and guided by the Moonlight
[33:24] amen but but here's this artificial
[33:27] man-made light am that that that that is
[33:31] that is really messing them up that's
[33:33] right and and here and therefore they're
[33:35] they're constantly hitting and bashing
[33:38] themselves on that light and it's
[33:39] producing nothing for them it's not
[33:41] doing anything for them amen and so it's
[33:44] a false light amen it seems like it
[33:47] gives hope but there's no life about
[33:49] that light you see and so that's the
[33:51] reason why Saints you and I amen that
[33:54] the light that we have must come from
[33:56] the original source which is the Lord
[33:58] Jesus Christ which is by the Holy Ghost
[34:00] amen that light produces life amen
[34:04] anything else amen outside of that is is
[34:06] nothing but man-made amen it's your own
[34:09] thing it's your own light it it's
[34:11] something fake amen and when others amen
[34:14] are drawn to it amen they realize
[34:16] they've hit a dead end that's right I
[34:20] can't get any life from this person I
[34:21] can't get any light from this from this
[34:23] person amen I've hit a dead end with you
[34:25] see amen so we must amen we must be sure
[34:29] that we know that we know that we have
[34:31] the originator of that life in US amen
[34:34] that we are born again amen filled with
[34:36] the holy spirit amen amen be be be led
[34:39] by the spirit of God Amen praise the
[34:42] Lord because he is the original of that
[34:45] true life amen so we also know that
[34:49] there's a there's a thing also called
[34:51] phototropism and phototropism is this
[34:54] plant growth when when when plants are
[34:57] grow and the and they're and and they
[34:59] seem to to tilt or lean over to wherever
[35:02] the light is amen you see anything amen
[35:06] that has life or that has the potential
[35:09] for life amen wants to go where there is
[35:11] life amen amen wants to be around where
[35:14] there is life amen where there is death
[35:18] they don't want to be around there amen
[35:19] but where there is life they want to be
[35:21] around where there's life praise God
[35:23] that's why I don't see why a Christian
[35:25] amen wants to be around with with with
[35:27] uh uh with with with worldly people and
[35:30] or or or being or feeding on worldly
[35:33] things amen because that's that's what a
[35:35] Christian wants to feed on the good
[35:37] things that bring more life even to him
[35:39] amen and what causes that that that
[35:41] plant amen as it's as it's leaning
[35:43] towards that life it's causing it to
[35:45] grow even more amen praise God as you
[35:48] are leaning towards the light or as you
[35:50] are leaning towards Jesus Christ it's
[35:52] not he's not going to make you not grow
[35:55] amen he's not going to crush you amen
[35:57] you're going to keep growing in him amen
[36:00] praise God it's as simple as that amen
[36:04] Jesus said in John 644 no man can come
[36:07] to me except the Father which hath sent
[36:10] me draw him amen right or
[36:15] phototropism amen draw him and I will
[36:19] raise him up at the last day amen amen
[36:22] because what will do that what what will
[36:24] raise amen the the same Jesus Christ
[36:26] that they had is the same Jesus Christ
[36:27] that raises them up in the last day amen
[36:30] praise the Lord when you when we're
[36:32] talking about the stature of a perfect
[36:34] man what is what is it that is drawing I
[36:36] always like to think of this like a as a
[36:38] magnet amen it's a magnet from above
[36:40] that's drawing amen it's drawing us
[36:43] slowly and it's not it's not us amen
[36:46] we're we're having to kind of kind of
[36:48] scratch amen oh I've made it through
[36:51] virtue oh oh I'm just barely hanging on
[36:55] knowledge oh Temperance and and then you
[36:57] know it's nothing that you do amen but
[37:00] it's the Holy Ghost In You producing
[37:02] this virtues in your life and as I
[37:05] always said it C it comes they come
[37:07] through trials
[37:10] tribulations
[37:12] tests um all those things that you and I
[37:15] need that will cause us you you still
[37:18] don't have uh a Temperance you're going
[37:21] to get things in their life that happen
[37:22] that will cause make you to have more
[37:24] and more Temperance you don't have
[37:26] brotherly love brotherly kindness more
[37:29] things will happen in your life that
[37:30] will have to produce brotherly kindness
[37:32] at some point amen that Holy Spirit in
[37:36] your life amen the potentials are there
[37:38] amen the potentials are there at Faith
[37:41] amen praise God but it's that other amen
[37:44] is what brother Wade was talking about
[37:45] this morning that uh the on Sunday that
[37:47] holy spirit amen it's what's drawing
[37:50] amen praise God it's word on top of word
[37:53] life on top of life amen you receive
[37:55] life here amen but it's more life amen
[37:57] that's drawing you Amen to keep growing
[37:59] in him praise God we don't want to stay
[38:02] stale we don't want to stay the same as
[38:04] we did 10 years ago or you know God sent
[38:07] a prophet that's wonderful that's good
[38:09] people need that still amen but amen we
[38:12] must be growing in the stature of a
[38:14] perfect man we must be growing amen so
[38:18] no man can come to the father unless the
[38:20] father draws him first amen so as light
[38:24] we know that light can cause life as we
[38:28] just as as we just read it it can do
[38:30] positive things amen but light if it's
[38:33] not well balanced it can also cause
[38:35] damage and Destroy amen and some
[38:39] examples of this is ultraviolet
[38:41] radiation amen it's caused by light
[38:44] sunlight amen but it can cause damage to
[38:48] your skin it can cause damage to the
[38:50] eyes amen and and into different parts
[38:52] of the body but it's
[38:54] light but it's not well balanced for you
[38:58] and I'm so glad that God has given us a
[39:00] balanced diet a balanced word in this
[39:02] hour amen not too much Amen to lead us
[39:06] amen into some sort of legalism or not
[39:09] too little amen that we're starving for
[39:11] for for more of God Amen he's given us
[39:13] an exact exactly what we need Amen in
[39:16] order to grow in this hour amen praise
[39:19] God when you when you come into this
[39:20] message or you preach the word or or or
[39:22] or you talk to someone about the gospel
[39:24] amen I can't start talking to them about
[39:27] D 70 weeks if they've never heard
[39:28] anything about the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:31] being able to save them from from their
[39:33] sins amen because that'd be too much
[39:35] amen you'd be liable to to more do more
[39:38] damage even though you're you're giving
[39:39] them light amen but you'd be able to do
[39:42] more damage to them if if if because
[39:44] they can't handle it it's like you're
[39:45] trying to shove a a steak down their
[39:47] throat a baby's throat you can't can't
[39:50] can't do that the baby's going to choke
[39:53] amen amen but you start little by little
[39:55] amen you start with the milk and you
[39:58] start with those things amen and
[40:00] eventually amen they'll they'll they'll
[40:02] build up to the to the steak amen praise
[40:05] God to the tacos Amen to the barbecue
[40:09] you see eventually they'll be able to
[40:11] there there's great things in store for
[40:13] them oh yes it's not just about the the
[40:17] the milk amen or the powder milk or the
[40:19] or even the the mom's milk you see amen
[40:22] that all has its purpose though and it
[40:25] and and it's there for them to start but
[40:26] eventually there's some other good
[40:28] things for them amen praise God but you
[40:30] got to start them softly and slowly amen
[40:34] and and and and sometimes you know it's
[40:35] hard for us you know as as as parents
[40:38] and and and as as as us dealing with
[40:41] people amen because that's what gives us
[40:44] patience to to have to deal with people
[40:46] that that are not getting
[40:48] it you you but you have to remember amen
[40:52] if you got it amen if you got it you
[40:54] you've been being trained for the last
[40:56] 30 40 years amen and that that that that
[41:00] child of yours is still hasn't only but
[41:02] lived maybe 15 years amen and you're wed
[41:05] to for them to see what you see and it
[41:07] doesn't work that way you see they have
[41:10] to be slowly trained it might sound kind
[41:14] of uh uh you know out of you might think
[41:17] well I'm way past this but but you see
[41:19] in you humbling yourself into their
[41:21] level amen it causes you to obtain
[41:24] Temperance causes you to get patience
[41:28] amen and all those things God does it so
[41:30] perfectly because we cannot live this
[41:33] life thinking we know it all I've come
[41:36] to I'm 50 years old and I've got it down
[41:39] packed no you
[41:41] don't there's people that are older than
[41:44] that that are still learning lessons you
[41:47] see we're all
[41:49] learning Brother
[41:52] Don all of us are learning lessons and
[41:54] I've said before until you leave live
[41:57] leave this earth you're still going to
[41:58] be learning things learning about life
[42:02] learning learning what this is all about
[42:04] amen because it's a growth process amen
[42:07] praise God and I love what brother Dale
[42:09] would always say he said I can truly not
[42:11] say that I'm born again until I've I've
[42:13] met him amen until I've gone to the
[42:15] other side then I could say I am born
[42:17] again amen praise the Lord Jesus so we
[42:20] are growing amen we are gr into that
[42:23] stature amen so so there there's light
[42:25] that can destroy you know there's
[42:27] ultraviolet lights is causes skin damage
[42:29] and high intensity light sources which
[42:31] are explosions and fires now it's nice
[42:34] to have a nice fire you know during the
[42:37] fall and during the winter time to warm
[42:39] you up amen but let that fire get out of
[42:42] control then then it won't be good then
[42:45] that that good that good light that
[42:47] light won't be good at that moment you
[42:49] see but but but but when the light is
[42:52] contained amen and when that fire is
[42:54] contained then it can it can do some
[42:56] good things praise God
[42:57] laser lights amen it also it can burn it
[43:00] does Burns and gives eye injuries amen
[43:04] so as I said you know there has to be a
[43:06] balance of light in order to bring forth
[43:09] life amen you have to have a balance
[43:11] praise God now remember light amen
[43:14] remember he is the life and he is the
[43:17] light amen and he gives forth life amen
[43:21] before you can go on with that light
[43:23] praise God you have to have that life
[43:25] for praise the Lord too much light can
[43:27] cause damage or too little light can
[43:29] cause damage as well amen it's the same
[43:31] thing with us as parents amen uh you
[43:35] know when we're too loose on the rules
[43:36] amen we make it makes them for being
[43:39] broken all the time
[43:41] right when we're too loose on the rules
[43:43] we say this we expect this out of you
[43:45] but when they they break the rule and
[43:47] you don't do anything about it they're
[43:49] just going to keep doing it that's right
[43:51] they're just going to keep doing it and
[43:52] doing oh parents are just Loosey Goosey
[43:55] and you know we could just get by with
[43:57] anything why because all they are is
[43:59] just
[44:00] talk all they are is just talk and and
[44:03] we can just amen that's that's not even
[44:06] the child's fault that's your fault as a
[44:08] parent and then you're wondering why why
[44:10] my kid has gone wild amen why my kid is
[44:13] is disobedient and rebellious amen it's
[44:16] because you haven't tightened the screws
[44:18] on that right you haven't tightened the
[44:20] screws on those on on on on those things
[44:22] in in your family or in your home amen
[44:25] but yet too strict of the rules allows
[44:27] for no room for
[44:30] Grace amen and eventually those kids
[44:35] amen who have that strictness put down
[44:37] upon them they'll do it for a time but
[44:40] they'll come a time where they'll break
[44:41] those rules anyways right they're going
[44:43] to go out and do it
[44:45] anyways because amen it's not in their
[44:48] heart to do it amen to live to to what
[44:52] the rules are there for that's not in
[44:55] their heart amen it's it it's they're
[44:58] only doing it to please you you see so
[45:02] you have to have a balance just like
[45:04] there has to be a balance of the light
[45:06] amen there can't be too much light but
[45:08] there can't be too little light either
[45:10] you have to have a certain balance in
[45:12] order for there to bring forth life amen
[45:15] and for there to be Harmony and for
[45:16] there to be uh peace praise God and and
[45:20] you know and and and we are still in the
[45:22] same in in this road amen we're learning
[45:24] as parents and we're learning amen what
[45:27] to do what not to do don't do that again
[45:29] do okay do this more more of this you
[45:31] see there has to be a balance Amen in
[45:34] order to bring forth life amen in our in
[45:37] our children's and you know eventually
[45:38] it's God that does the work we know that
[45:41] eventually you can do all that you can
[45:44] do but eventually it's God that has to
[45:46] change their lives you see and if God
[45:49] doesn't do it then there's nothing else
[45:51] that you and I can do amen but what a
[45:53] great thing that it is that we can turn
[45:55] them over to God Amen
[45:57] what a great thing it is that we could
[45:59] just Lord here they are you the one who
[46:02] brought them in this world you're the
[46:03] one who gave them life amen you brought
[46:06] them here in this world and you I know
[46:08] that you have a purpose for them so here
[46:10] you are Lord You know here you are right
[46:14] that gives you a a peace of mind us as
[46:17] parents it gives you rest in him knowing
[46:20] that God is in control that's right God
[46:23] is in control of their lives praise the
[46:24] Lord amen don't worry about about them
[46:27] amen just live the life before them
[46:30] right praise God so now let's let's look
[46:34] again here real quick at this at this uh
[46:36] at the law and
[46:40] and and so we were talking about that
[46:43] God he originally well he wanted Grace
[46:46] he wanted Mercy he wanted love for his
[46:49] people amen for the children of Israel
[46:51] amen and and when the law of Moses was
[46:54] given amen as I said it was was given to
[46:57] for to for guidance it was given for
[47:00] separation from other nations so they
[47:02] could know amen who they were amen
[47:04] people knew who the CH who Israel was
[47:07] amen they had somebody they had a god
[47:10] somebody that was with them and they
[47:11] knew what had happened in Egypt they
[47:14] knew so that it was different so and
[47:15] there were some people amen that that
[47:17] they have a message in their life amen
[47:20] they they're following a prophet and and
[47:22] things happen in their life and and and
[47:25] and changes take place and and their
[47:27] children and and God does things amongst
[47:29] them because they have amen a word that
[47:32] they live by amen and that's what that's
[47:34] why God Amen wanted to give them that
[47:36] word amen that law in reality what he
[47:39] wanted for them to live was Grace amen
[47:42] and and but but but yet it was because
[47:44] for them to give him some sort of order
[47:46] in order for them to to Define amen
[47:48] these things in their life to Define
[47:50] what sin was amen right and things like
[47:53] that amen because Paul says that I would
[47:56] not know amen what what the I forgot the
[47:59] example he gives there I would not know
[48:01] about stealing if if the Bible didn't
[48:03] say not to steal you see if the word of
[48:05] God did not say don't steal you see you
[48:07] wouldn't have known you would have just
[48:09] picked up somebody's iPhone amen and and
[48:12] this is mine now yeah and I'm going to
[48:14] sell it on
[48:17] eBay amen and get some money out of it
[48:19] and it's okay it's cool you know it's
[48:21] it's all right you know and I'll just go
[48:23] around and just do that you see it it it
[48:26] but you see there's a law there and it's
[48:29] not just God's law but but there's a law
[48:31] there also in the books of of of of of
[48:34] mankind and government amen that you're
[48:36] not supposed to to rob people and you're
[48:38] not supposed to to take people's things
[48:40] you see and and so or else there's
[48:43] consequences for those things or or or
[48:45] take the or or or take the money off
[48:48] people out of people's accounts and
[48:50] stuff like that you're not supposed to
[48:51] do that or else there's there's uh
[48:54] there's repercussions to that if there
[48:56] is that in the human amen or in the
[48:58] government the natural how much more in
[49:00] God Amen why because sin was present
[49:03] amen amen if there was no sin there was
[49:05] no need for a law amen if there was no
[49:08] sin Amen to to that for for people to
[49:12] fall under amen everybody was born in
[49:14] sin shaped in iniquity and everybody
[49:16] needed some guidance in their life
[49:18] praise God and the children of Israel
[49:20] there definitely needed it but when
[49:23] Moses came down amen from the from the
[49:26] mount sin and I that was the first thing
[49:28] he saw he saw them there worshiping a
[49:31] calf a golden calf made out of gold I
[49:35] I'm I'm actually surprised as to how
[49:37] fast they made that thing
[49:39] right and Aaron you know when Aaron he
[49:42] he he Moses came to Aaron and asked him
[49:45] he said what is this what is going on
[49:48] here and Aaron
[49:49] said you know I just I G they gave me
[49:52] their their gold and they gave me all
[49:54] their their earrings and everything I
[49:56] just threw in the fire and here jumps
[49:58] out this calf and they decided to
[50:01] worship
[50:01] it right and and and so this it's how
[50:07] the it's how people are but and and what
[50:10] did what did Moses do he out of anger
[50:13] amen he throws down those those those
[50:15] tablets of stones and then they break
[50:17] amen and God of course gives them some
[50:19] some some other ones and that showed
[50:21] amen they needed amen some sort of
[50:23] structure in their in their life amen
[50:26] because again that was before the Holy
[50:29] Ghost amen and really that's what the
[50:31] Holy Ghost is supposed to do because
[50:33] Jesus amen he he he lived that law he
[50:36] fulfilled that law amen so that that
[50:39] spirit that fulfilled that law goes into
[50:41] the believer so that now you're
[50:43] fulfilled the law amen by that spirit
[50:46] amen that fulfilled the law which is the
[50:48] spirit of Christ praise the Lord that's
[50:51] good amen
[50:52] so now while the law itself amen it was
[50:56] good it it was weak Amen in that it
[50:59] lacked the power to change a sinful
[51:02] heart it could not change sinful Hearts
[51:05] it could not change the heart it it
[51:07] could make you do things amen and and if
[51:10] you broke them amen you'd get
[51:12] consequences but it would not change the
[51:14] heart you see and that's what I was
[51:15] talking about with our with children
[51:17] amen who don't do things because they
[51:19] desire to or because out of respect or
[51:22] out of obedience or out of respect to
[51:24] God it's because they they they they
[51:26] have to you see and and and so that's
[51:28] what law was that's what rules and
[51:30] regulations do amen really it's what
[51:32] causes it draws people to just do things
[51:35] amen just out of out of out of uh it's
[51:37] not from the heart amen praise the Lord
[51:40] and so that's what the law did it wasn't
[51:42] from the heart amen and that's why in
[51:44] the Old Testament you know when we read
[51:46] a case of someone showing Mercy or
[51:50] someone showing Grace amen after the law
[51:53] was introduced it's shocking to us
[51:56] because we think that in the Old
[51:58] Testament everybody lived like that
[52:01] Stern and and and and and and do it my
[52:04] way and and and but there was also
[52:07] people amen that God was working in
[52:09] their heart amen that that knew what the
[52:11] heart what the heart was and and and
[52:14] they did things amen uh uh because it
[52:16] was in their heart to do things you see
[52:19] praise the Lord Jesus and so uh one of
[52:22] those examples that we can see by Moses
[52:24] himself Moses who is a representative of
[52:27] the law who is remember as I as I said
[52:30] to you two Sundays ago God he was the
[52:34] law to the people he was the word to the
[52:36] people amen and so Moses himself when he
[52:40] came down from that mountain he he he he
[52:44] was angry and he threw down those stone
[52:46] tablets and and God was was was was
[52:50] saying Amen to the way he was acting
[52:52] he's like yeah I I'm I'm with you
[52:55] Moses I'm about to destroy these people
[52:58] right you better believe it and he was
[53:01] angry his his his anger was was was was
[53:04] uh was about to destroy them but what
[53:07] did Moses do at that moment he did he
[53:10] realized wait a second I may be angry
[53:13] God God's angry is wax amen but he threw
[53:16] himself between God and the people and
[53:20] cried for mercy and Grace for them
[53:23] amen the same law the same word
[53:27] amen cried for mercy and Grace and
[53:29] because he cried out amen I God heard
[53:32] him and the people were not destroyed
[53:34] amen but he did give them a choice he
[53:37] made them to choose amen who are you to
[53:39] serve this day and that's what God does
[53:42] to you and I amen you give Mercy he
[53:44] gives Grace amen but he also gives you a
[53:46] choice amen praise God who are you going
[53:50] to serve this day amen whether the gods
[53:52] of Egypt the gods of this world the
[53:55] music of this world the the people of
[53:57] this world the Fashions of this world
[53:59] Amen or are you going to serve a living
[54:00] God Amen in this hour praise Lord you
[54:04] you choose mercy and Grace was there for
[54:07] them the fact that they gave the they
[54:08] gave them opportunity to choose that was
[54:10] the mercy and the grace am amen and so
[54:14] that was that was that was Moses he did
[54:16] that amen interceding for the people
[54:18] with with empathy and compassion even
[54:21] though the people didn't deserve it but
[54:24] he knew that there was some people there
[54:25] that their heart was not in that they
[54:27] were caught up in that you see praise
[54:30] God then Moses again in number you can
[54:34] read that uh in Exodus chapter 32 but
[54:37] when you and then when you go over into
[54:38] Numbers Chapter 14 Moses again after the
[54:42] spies came back from the from from the
[54:45] Canaan and said and gave the bad
[54:48] report the the the children of Israel
[54:51] they got distraught before the Lord they
[54:54] got scared they got unbelief came
[54:57] amongst the camp that's right and Moses
[55:00] and CA Caleb and Joshua they were they
[55:03] were in the frame of mind that we are
[55:05] more than able to take that land we are
[55:08] more than and they tried to get up and
[55:09] try to quiet the people to to shut them
[55:12] up and and say listen we are more than
[55:14] able because that promise belongs to us
[55:17] but yet the people didn't even want to
[55:18] listen to
[55:19] them and so and so God was God again man
[55:24] I just the patience that God has with
[55:27] with
[55:28] us I tell you what with
[55:30] me it's it's great but I'm so thankful
[55:34] for it
[55:36] am you know sometimes we think that God
[55:39] is just this wrathful God and that that
[55:41] all that's amen but the fact that you
[55:44] are even still alive amen at this very
[55:46] moment breathing living you don't
[55:49] deserve it amen you're not you're not
[55:51] making your own body do its functions
[55:55] amen it's it's the that life going in
[55:57] through you where that life come from
[55:59] amen it came from God and the mercy and
[56:01] the grace that he has towards us amen
[56:04] praise the Lord and here's that mercy
[56:06] and Grace that he that that that Moses
[56:09] again he he puts himself before the
[56:11] people amen and he asked the Lord Lord
[56:14] forgive them for this sin forgive them
[56:17] for this because uh Lord if you destroy
[56:20] them what will the other nations say
[56:22] Here Comes God there's God oh and
[56:24] they'll laugh at you Lord they'll say
[56:27] they'll say Lord uh the Lord brought
[56:29] them out of Egypt wasn't wasn't was
[56:31] powerful enough to bring them out of
[56:32] Egypt but wasn't power enough to bring
[56:34] them into their Promised Land you see
[56:37] and God heard Moses and because he cried
[56:40] for he cried for mercy and he cried and
[56:43] and uh against God show God shows Grace
[56:47] again and the people of Israel amen they
[56:49] continue they had to suffer the
[56:51] consequences they're at kades Bara and
[56:53] they had to walk around the the the the
[56:56] desert for 40 years amen and you know
[57:00] I've been reading the Old Testament when
[57:02] Jesus said that all your when he was
[57:05] telling the Israel oh you're of your F
[57:07] you're of your father the devil and all
[57:10] of those that were in were in the desert
[57:12] they were they all ate of the same mana
[57:14] and they all died and you know and
[57:17] sometimes you might read that and you
[57:18] think you think uh oh well he's just
[57:20] maybe saying that as a me no when you
[57:22] reading the book of numbers they all
[57:25] died every single one of those people
[57:27] that came out of Egypt they died the
[57:29] ones that remained were their children
[57:31] their offspring amen every one of them
[57:34] so Jesus was was exactly right when they
[57:36] all of them died because of their
[57:38] unbelief the promised land was only like
[57:41] 5 days away from from Egypt am walking
[57:45] but yet they had to go around that
[57:46] mountain 40 years Amen in order to get
[57:50] to the to to where they needed to get
[57:52] and eventually they did not all get
[57:54] there amen amen the original ones that
[57:57] that came out of Egypt was Joshua and
[58:00] Caleb amen so in reading these examples
[58:04] amen it it seems like God was dealing
[58:07] more with Moses than than anything else
[58:10] you know what it seemed like it was God
[58:12] dealing with Moses during those those
[58:14] times it was trying to get Moses to
[58:16] react a certain way to cause him to to
[58:20] give him some growth you see praise the
[58:22] Lord and and sometimes you know we think
[58:24] that the trials that we have with but
[58:26] with our children and with our loved
[58:28] ones amen it may not be just for them
[58:30] it's for you and I as parents amen it's
[58:34] for you and I amen where where we are
[58:37] not stacking up amen it's helping us to
[58:39] St to be able to get our things together
[58:42] amen where is it that we're failing Lord
[58:43] where what is it that we're doing it's
[58:45] it's not really for them amen it's e the
[58:48] the work of God for them that's easy
[58:50] amen it's you and I that it's hard for
[58:52] him to work with cuz we think we know it
[58:54] all and we think we got it all figured
[58:56] out and we think that we because amen
[58:58] that's that's just uh because we're the
[59:01] parents but that's not how it works all
[59:04] the
[59:05] time amen you realize the the more and
[59:08] more we we see uh you know our children
[59:12] grow and and the things and things
[59:14] happen in our lives and things we
[59:16] realize amen Lord I don't know it all I
[59:19] don't know all things amen but you
[59:22] do you do amen and you're and you're in
[59:26] control and I just I just humble myself
[59:28] and give myself to you Lord amen praise
[59:32] God and so you know if you if you listen
[59:36] to to the the Sunday School lesson this
[59:38] past Sunday we were talking about
[59:40] Leviticus chapter 10 and in there in
[59:43] there at the end uh just to briefly
[59:46] briefly describe it that's where uh
[59:49] Aaron's two sons they got killed because
[59:52] they offered Strange Fire to the Lord in
[59:54] the Tabernacle and so they got killed
[59:57] right there in the presence of the
[59:58] people right in front of the people they
[1:00:01] went in there and they offered a fire
[1:00:04] that that wasn't the fire that was
[1:00:06] prescribed by God it wasn't the fire
[1:00:08] that Lit the the the the the Holy Fire
[1:00:11] you see it was something else and they
[1:00:14] went in there and as soon as they
[1:00:15] offered God killed them right there and
[1:00:17] then in front of Moses in front of Moses
[1:00:19] in front of Aaron their dad in front of
[1:00:22] their two other brothers everybody saw
[1:00:24] it because in in in Leviticus chapter 9
[1:00:28] they had just came from a
[1:00:30] Revival the fire of God Amen was came
[1:00:33] down the presence of God came down on
[1:00:35] the back of the Tabernacle on the holy
[1:00:37] on the holy holies of holies and and the
[1:00:39] people were rejoicing and and and
[1:00:42] everything and then Leviticus chapter 10
[1:00:44] here comes the two sons and they offer
[1:00:45] that Strange Fire and that and that
[1:00:48] Revival was
[1:00:50] quenched and the people of Israel amen
[1:00:53] they they saw this and Aaron but what
[1:00:56] like about about Aaron is that the is
[1:00:58] that he continues in that service he
[1:01:00] continues F finishing up that service
[1:01:03] even though he just saw his two sons get
[1:01:05] killed and it's interesting you put
[1:01:07] yourself in in in Aaron's shoes amen his
[1:01:10] two sons just died thinking that they
[1:01:13] were doing something for the Lord but
[1:01:14] they wasn't from their heart their heart
[1:01:17] was elsewhere and therefore God had to
[1:01:20] take kill them and here's Aaron and his
[1:01:22] two brothers and and his two other sons
[1:01:25] and they're there seeing this I'm sure
[1:01:27] that they were upset they were they were
[1:01:29] they were they were they were uh uh
[1:01:32] extra you know they were they were grief
[1:01:34] a lot of grief upon them and so Moses
[1:01:37] comes to them and asks them you know
[1:01:39] about the goat that they were supposed
[1:01:41] to eat you know just to make a long
[1:01:42] story short a goat that they were
[1:01:44] supposed to eat and they instead instead
[1:01:46] of eating them they they throw it in the
[1:01:48] fire and then they burn it up and Moses
[1:01:51] gets upset and he gets he gets mad at
[1:01:54] them and says what in the world
[1:01:56] this go you're supposed to go by the
[1:01:58] Commandments of God and you're supposed
[1:02:00] to do exactly what what the law says and
[1:02:03] you didn't do it amen and and Moses amen
[1:02:07] he he had the right to be mad at them
[1:02:09] because he was the word that word of the
[1:02:10] Lord came to him amen but Aaron gave
[1:02:14] them and you can read that in Leviticus
[1:02:16] chapter 10 Aaron says how can I eat this
[1:02:19] my sons and I being that we just went
[1:02:22] through what we went through today I
[1:02:24] just lost my two sons Aaron I just lost
[1:02:28] family members I saw them get killed in
[1:02:29] front of my eyes how can I do this
[1:02:32] before the Lord with all my
[1:02:34] heart and the Bible says in Leviticus
[1:02:36] chap 10: 20 that Moses he
[1:02:40] understood and if Moses understood that
[1:02:42] means god
[1:02:43] understood amen and he didn't didn't ask
[1:02:46] them any more questions and so Moses was
[1:02:49] there showing a form of empathy amen a
[1:02:51] form of of of of of U uh you know uh
[1:02:55] just empathy for what for what Aaron was
[1:02:58] going through
[1:02:59] amen a and sometimes amen that's what we
[1:03:02] have to do amen instead of just
[1:03:05] sometimes the law the law is there but
[1:03:08] when does when can the law be be be
[1:03:10] applied and and when does the law need
[1:03:13] to not be applied amen there are
[1:03:14] situations when that needs to happen
[1:03:16] amen and I'll give you I'll give
[1:03:19] you an an example here in just a moment
[1:03:22] but um you know when when let's just say
[1:03:26] that there's a a a lady who's who's a
[1:03:30] car that's driving really fast down the
[1:03:33] down the highway amen
[1:03:35] and and it's breaking the law it's
[1:03:38] breaking the speed limit it's breaking
[1:03:40] the law and goes by a police officer to
[1:03:43] stop and you know I say this because we
[1:03:45] we had this happened to us when my wife
[1:03:46] and I when when my wife was pregnant
[1:03:48] with Bella and we needed to get from
[1:03:51] Anderson South Carolina to Greenville
[1:03:53] and I passed by my emergency lights and
[1:03:56] I said I don't care if I get stopped I'm
[1:03:59] going amen and but we passed by a cop he
[1:04:02] didn't do anything to us though cuz he
[1:04:04] saw that we had their emergency flashers
[1:04:06] on I guess but what if that cop amen he
[1:04:10] pulls out and and and that that car is
[1:04:12] speeding and she pulls them
[1:04:14] over and stops him and they gets to the
[1:04:19] car and sees that the reason why they're
[1:04:21] driving fast because there's a pregnant
[1:04:23] woman in there about to have a baby
[1:04:26] now the cop he has two two choices he
[1:04:29] can either go ahead and apply the
[1:04:31] law give them the
[1:04:33] ticket and and and and and waste their
[1:04:37] time cuz he's wasting their time This
[1:04:40] Woman's about to give
[1:04:42] birth right and and
[1:04:46] and nothing good will come out of that
[1:04:49] the people will come out out will come
[1:04:51] out in a way think thinking something
[1:04:54] against that cop uh you know something
[1:04:56] uh I don't want to see that cop anymore
[1:04:59] amen and if I have to see him in court
[1:05:01] I'll tell him a thing or two or the
[1:05:04] other thing is the cop sees the
[1:05:07] emergency and says wait a second let me
[1:05:10] just help you and he
[1:05:12] escorts the woman to the to the hospital
[1:05:16] you see what will the lady say then
[1:05:19] afterwards what will the family think
[1:05:21] you see he the the officer he he's said
[1:05:24] wait a second let's get even faster
[1:05:26] let's go even faster to get to the to
[1:05:28] the to the hospital because there's an
[1:05:30] emergency the law was there the law said
[1:05:33] only 70 M an hour but hey we need to get
[1:05:36] to the hospital right away you see
[1:05:40] so what's going to be the outcome of
[1:05:42] that I believe good things will come out
[1:05:44] of that that officer will have respect
[1:05:47] from the family that officer will have
[1:05:49] respect amen from even even probably the
[1:05:52] people around you see because amen he
[1:05:56] did he for he he overlooked the law for
[1:05:59] a moment amen and looked at the need at
[1:06:01] the moment the need at the moment was
[1:06:03] more important praise God you see so in
[1:06:06] Leviticus in in Leviticus chapter 10
[1:06:08] that's exactly what happened Moses
[1:06:10] overlooked the law for the moment and
[1:06:14] saw that there was a need amen there was
[1:06:17] a need at the moment Aaron was was hurt
[1:06:19] Aaron needed Amen to to to to be
[1:06:23] restored and he did what he did to do
[1:06:26] Amen in order to restore him praise God
[1:06:28] Amen let's not let's let's not amen just
[1:06:31] you know just keep hitting each other
[1:06:34] down and hurting each other amen if if a
[1:06:36] brother Falls just restore him back amen
[1:06:39] just bring that's what the Bible says to
[1:06:40] do amen we all make mistakes we all we
[1:06:43] all do things wrong amen but restoration
[1:06:46] is more powerful amen than any crushing
[1:06:49] that we can do am amen I I believe that
[1:06:52] with all my heart what what is that
[1:06:53] light for amen it's to cause light life
[1:06:56] amen praise the Lord
[1:06:58] Jesus so Jesus amen who is the life to
[1:07:02] shine upon men he came on the scene Amen
[1:07:06] in a very leg legalistic climate amen
[1:07:08] the religious leaders of that day amen
[1:07:10] the Pharisees the Sadducees amen that's
[1:07:12] all they were they were about that law
[1:07:14] amen but they didn't realize amen that
[1:07:16] there was a there was a a life amen The
[1:07:18] Life of Christ the life of the life of
[1:07:20] God that the the one who gave the law
[1:07:22] was standing right in front of them amen
[1:07:25] praise the Lord
[1:07:26] and so we know that the law amen I'm
[1:07:28] just going to go quickly here now the
[1:07:29] law we know it's not evil amen but it
[1:07:32] served as a mirror Amen to reveal the
[1:07:35] condition of our heart amen the law
[1:07:37] itself but who could fulfill that law it
[1:07:39] was Christ Christ was the only one who
[1:07:42] could fulfill that law amen and that's
[1:07:44] why when we are in Christ the law is
[1:07:46] fulfilled amen hallelujah amen we
[1:07:48] respect we don't we don't commit
[1:07:50] adultery we don't do those things but
[1:07:52] the what causes not to commit adultery
[1:07:53] is the holy spirit in US amen your own
[1:07:56] natural man will do that amen but the
[1:07:58] holy spirit in US amen the true holy
[1:08:00] spirit will cause us amen don't don't do
[1:08:03] those things amen it's it's a red light
[1:08:05] there amen that will cause us and give
[1:08:07] us to do those things John 11:7 says for
[1:08:09] the law was given by Moses but Grace and
[1:08:12] Truth came by Jesus Christ amen we know
[1:08:15] that Jesus embodied the perfect balance
[1:08:18] between grace and law
[1:08:20] amen praise the Lord and so that same
[1:08:24] God Amen who gave law is the same God
[1:08:26] that gave us Jesus Christ amen it's the
[1:08:30] same person amen why because he wanted
[1:08:32] it to balance it amen because he said in
[1:08:34] Matthew Chapter 5 he said you you you've
[1:08:37] read where you know this that and the
[1:08:40] other amen but I say unto you amen you
[1:08:44] read where if somebody smacks you you
[1:08:46] know smack them again I can't remember
[1:08:48] what exactly what it says there but you
[1:08:51] do this amen eye for an eye tooth for a
[1:08:54] tooth you see
[1:08:57] and but Jesus says but I say unto you
[1:09:00] amen love your enemies do good to them
[1:09:03] that despitefully hate you amen so it's
[1:09:06] bringing both things together it's
[1:09:09] bringing law but it's bringing Grace at
[1:09:11] the same time you see praise the Lord
[1:09:14] and that's what Jesus came to do amen
[1:09:17] but when we're just always just looking
[1:09:18] at law law law amen that will never
[1:09:21] bring that the law never saved anybody
[1:09:24] in the Old Testament law never gave
[1:09:25] anybody the Holy Ghost law amen only put
[1:09:28] you in jail but when Grace came amen and
[1:09:31] applied that law to it amen it could
[1:09:33] save people then amen Grace that's what
[1:09:35] I need I need that light I need that
[1:09:38] life first before I can get that before
[1:09:40] I can walk in that light amen praise the
[1:09:43] Lord Jesus amen so I don't I just don't
[1:09:46] want letter laws rules amen and and
[1:09:48] regulations amen I want love Mercy Grace
[1:09:52] amen first those things that can
[1:09:54] actually change me
[1:09:56] amen amen and you know there was a there
[1:09:59] was a with this well let me just let me
[1:10:02] just read this quote you know brother
[1:10:04] brandom I read this quote Sunday but
[1:10:05] brother brandom said this he said now I
[1:10:07] said to brother Schism to and brother
[1:10:10] NES to answer your question I said now I
[1:10:12] do not take either sides with you
[1:10:13] Brethren and I know as long as you fuss
[1:10:15] you are both wrong see because I would
[1:10:17] rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right
[1:10:20] in my heart amen then to be right in my
[1:10:23] Doctrine and wrong in my heart see I
[1:10:27] said after all it's your heart's
[1:10:29] condition praise the Lord Jesus amen a
[1:10:31] person a person that can have perfect
[1:10:33] theology amen and be devoid of love and
[1:10:36] compassion and it won't lead to anything
[1:10:38] you see you you can have because when
[1:10:41] you have amen the right Doctrine amen
[1:10:44] but don't have the right Spirit there
[1:10:47] you you're already set in your ways and
[1:10:50] there's no room there for growth but
[1:10:52] when you have the right Spirit even
[1:10:54] though you may not have the right
[1:10:56] Doctrine you're that's room for growth
[1:10:58] that same Spirit can lead me to the
[1:11:00] right Doctrine you see so it's better to
[1:11:03] have a right spirit amen good amen a
[1:11:07] right spirit amen when we deal with
[1:11:09] people amen praise God and and so uh
[1:11:13] true love and sincerity amen should be
[1:11:15] the foundation of a Christian's life
[1:11:18] amen not just rules and regulations amen
[1:11:21] not just rules and regulations there was
[1:11:22] a story I was reading um it was in
[1:11:26] 2015 and uh about Judge uh Oliva and a
[1:11:31] veteran amen and it happened in North
[1:11:34] Carolina and this judge he he he it says
[1:11:39] that that uh he showed compassion to a
[1:11:42] veteran named Joe Cerna who violated his
[1:11:46] probation by lying about a urine test
[1:11:48] for a a DWI charge and so this Joe Cerna
[1:11:53] he he was a a veteran and so was uh a
[1:11:56] veteran in Afghanistan he had went to
[1:11:58] multiple tours multiple I think people
[1:12:01] even went to Iraq and things like that
[1:12:03] but this judge he had to apply the law
[1:12:06] to him he gave him a night in jail for
[1:12:08] for for failing to to to fulfill what he
[1:12:11] was supposed to do with that DWI charge
[1:12:14] he gave him a night in jail but he knew
[1:12:17] this judge knew that this man was going
[1:12:20] through issues in his life he was he was
[1:12:21] suffering from PTSD he he he was having
[1:12:25] problems with with all these things you
[1:12:27] know that that that sometimes soldiers
[1:12:29] they come back and they they suffer and
[1:12:32] he this judge having been a soldier
[1:12:35] himself he knew that this man was going
[1:12:37] through this so the judge he ordered for
[1:12:39] him to spend one night in jail so here's
[1:12:42] Joe CNA he goes into jail and he says in
[1:12:45] his testimony that I felt like I wasn't
[1:12:48] even going to make it that night because
[1:12:50] I knew I was going to go through my mind
[1:12:52] he said I was thinking about that
[1:12:53] accident apparently he was in an
[1:12:55] accident with three of his other
[1:12:56] comrades a truck flipped over and they
[1:12:59] they landed upside down and the the
[1:13:01] smell of kerosene and and smoke and
[1:13:04] things that's all he could smell and
[1:13:06] that would keep coming in his mind he
[1:13:07] would smell kerosene and all these
[1:13:09] things and as he was there in in in uh
[1:13:13] they put him in the cell and about
[1:13:15] couple of maybe an hour or so later I
[1:13:18] don't know exactly the judge walks in
[1:13:20] and asks the the the the guard to let
[1:13:23] him in the same judge that put him in
[1:13:25] there walks in and the judge spends the
[1:13:28] whole night with him in that in that
[1:13:31] cell and he talks to him and he lets Joe
[1:13:34] talk to him back and they're talking and
[1:13:37] they're commun he said I would know I
[1:13:38] don't know if I would have made it if
[1:13:40] that judge the one that put me in there
[1:13:43] was the one that was that helped me at
[1:13:45] the same time and that's a true story in
[1:13:47] 2015 in North
[1:13:49] Carolina and so I you know that
[1:13:51] impressed me you see cuz the judge got
[1:13:54] in in in his shoes or in his boots so to
[1:13:57] speak you see he put himself in his
[1:14:00] shoes and he was able to help this man
[1:14:02] amen to be able to spend that one night
[1:14:04] in jail because he put himself in that
[1:14:07] position as well the judge didn't need
[1:14:09] to do that amen he was the judge he
[1:14:12] could been at home and sleeping in his
[1:14:13] nice bed with his wife and his family
[1:14:15] and stuff but he put himself in his
[1:14:18] shoes and he spend that night in there
[1:14:20] and I thought that was that was
[1:14:21] impressive if a judge I don't know if
[1:14:23] the man was Christian or not but if he
[1:14:25] wasn't amen what a wonderful thing he
[1:14:26] did for another human being how much
[1:14:29] more another human being with the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost can do for another brother or
[1:14:33] sister with the Holy Ghost amen put
[1:14:36] ourselves in each other's shoes amen and
[1:14:38] we'll see things a little bit different
[1:14:40] we'll look at each other a little bit
[1:14:42] differently and maybe there might not be
[1:14:44] misunderstandings amen we'll look at
[1:14:46] things a little bit differently when we
[1:14:48] put in each other's shoes amen amen so
[1:14:50] we want that life amen the life amen to
[1:14:53] help us walk in that light amen praise
[1:14:56] the Lord Jesus God bless you Saints
