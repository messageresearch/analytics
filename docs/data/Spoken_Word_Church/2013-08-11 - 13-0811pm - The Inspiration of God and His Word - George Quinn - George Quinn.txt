eyes of my heart open the eyes of my [Music] heart amen [Music] holy [Music] amen back home we we've been singing it for years and it's that little song and i know there's different little uh versions of it you know but um amen in moments like these i sing a song we always sing that and it is never failed to bring an anointing down me just before i stop step into the public you know so it's wonderful today praise god just to be in his house again hallelujah just to get the cream on top of the amen and i trust god will bless you today praise the lord so uh while we're standing we'll just turn straight to the word of god amen and i just got two little scriptures to read to you amen and the morning service obviously is always a little bit different than the afternoon service but um praise the lord if you turn in your bible to job and we're going to get it in job 32 if you've read the book of job you'll realize he's a man that you highly respect amen a man of unempowered integrity and honesty and so we'll just just go into chapter 32 there to get that and i'll be with you in a minute praise the lord my wife got me a new bible and still the new pages are there and it takes me a little bit longer amen but it's just one verse in chapter 32 and verse 8 and we can read it together today amen where it says but there is a spirit in mind and the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding there is a spirit of mind on the inspiration of the almighty it has to be that will give him understanding amen and of course as we know we can get right into uh uh to timothy amen uh in the second book which which we know so well amen chapter on verse 16 where timothy where paul says these these these lovely words amen praise the lord amen he says and from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise under salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished onto every good work amen lord jesus we certainly know as the prophet of god in our day said lord that any man in this nation could open this book today but lord accept you reveal what's in here lord it would be just words and letters lord to them so father god we thank you we're a people that you've revealed your word to in this last day and we just pray lord for this hour lord and father that you will just come and help us lord after we've had so much fellowship lovely fellowship today lord together and around the luncheon and we just pray now lord that you'll bless us and strengthen us all and lord to receive the last little portion for the day and that you will bless your word to every heart in jesus christ's name we ask it amen praise the lord god bless you may be seated and um praise the lord amen now that's why i read out uh today that we come to church to be inspired amen right praise the lord but don't don't lay at all on the preacher amen praise the lord but the word of god should inspire you amen and when you read these stories they are real stories they happen to real people and we want to uh to get in on that there amen and you know when we've come to be inspired and uh praise the lord inspiration just this word it just means god breathed god breathed so if you are inspired it means that god will be breathing on you and he'll breathe on you hallelujah and you'll have the breath of god you know we have a hymn i i don't know maybe but it's an old old hymn and it's breathe on me breath of god and that's exactly right this morning that would be uh this afternoon uh that would be our desire uh the inspiration of god and his word it's just what i felt to human here this afternoon amen and that's what i want to look at the inspiration of god and his word because his word is inspiring hallelujah uh what it has there's many things have inspired people but nothing will inspire you like the word of god should do amen and it's wonderful and the prophet says and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your confession so there's so much praise the lord today that's to do with our confession and i've always had a little uh a quote myself where if you say it can't be done it certainly will not be done a minute the mirror you know folks you you really uh you're touching the subject in my heart amen when even when my wife and i'm told that she'll not last to the next morning she's going to be dead by the morning light amen and if i give in to that if i confess that brother i tell you what and all i could say was god has not revealed that to me he said that for me so she's not here in the morning the lord never told me amen and i remember in church that morning i knew she was still living and in the church that morning we used a text of uh of uh this confession amen whatever you confess amen i'm not only that there but uh uh with god when brother branham used that little story about the girl over in sweden and uh he he showed that his brother said him look brother bill come on you've done enough tonight quit now and he looked round and he said no just one more amen the sovereignty of god the sovereignty of god in our lives friends it's so wonderful praise the lord that god let you you could have come as for uh samuel said this morning you could have come a number of ways to church in your in your car today you know but god will give you that free will to do that amen but to see him over above that amen that he's working all things together and uh wow i i tell you what that little girl you know uh so here was a tired prophet i just want more and then he heard that little knock coming across i said come on our little calipers you know and he looked at that little child he said honey you don't even need prayer hallelujah you are healed hallelujah that's what the angel showed me that's what the vision said sister larson take over and you see the little girl with her blonde hair and holding up the calipers you know that's the god that we worship today that's the god that that is here to inspire us amen and to bring your body into confession amen and i mean it hallelujah i'm not here to say well i've got an art i'll puff out some win here i'm serious hallelujah praise the lord that uh you know even my wife you know oh i'm very tired i'm so tired said quit saying that amen you just you know every time someone sit home tired and tired and you'll be tired you'll be tired hallelujah like what i'm trying to say is be positive about it hallelujah you know you say well the glasses have to happen you know it's hard no the glasses have full hallelujah keep on the positive side and and you know people know me back home and certainly i said you know uh well you know i don't want to be told anything negative amen i said i'm going to stand here positive hallelujah amen and that's the way we ought to do it because our people praise god you know and uh let god reveal it to you he'll take care of it amen that's what he said what you confess and if you confess so i'm always tired you'll be tired you know but let's confess that well god strengthened me amen god strengthened me god strengthened me and see what happens there you know it's just wonderful hallelujah and appraisal i'll just remember that because we've got a high priest of our confession he can only be what we say he is in our life amen that's the truth you know and uh praise god uh really and truly you know we're a people that have got clean minds hey man we don't need to look at filth and nonsense amen because that's what he is that's the high priest he is of our confession hallelujah i don't want to see nothing like that i just want to keep my eyes blinked hallelujah and see what god wants me to see so it's wonderful amen and he said remember have faith don't we ever stand on it that's it we're the standing people and stand and don't wait for we don't have to do that amen well i'll say a few things as we go on in the message you know uh brother branham says all right frankly says we're all pilgrims and we're all strangers here on the earth we're seeking a city to come whose builder and maker is god amen so that is the truth praise the lord talking to one of the sisters today at the lunch you know and that is the truth that's what we're looking for amen and we're looking for this great millennial rein amen we certainly are hallelujah it's not a a pie in the sky when you die thing that's a reality brother amen that's a reality all the sins of god have have told us that this word has told us that from the beginning to the end and we believe it that's the difference and it's going to be that way and i remember even when when jacob came before uh pharaoh you know and uh of course uh joseph joseph was perfection but brother brother said he had a little script on there you know he just you know a little scratch there because he said to his daddy he said now don't tell them you're shepherds amen he didn't want that you know the egyptians don't like shepherds so don't tell them you're shepherds amen and that said praise the lord don't tell someone there that you go to an end time church why but why amen preschool what am i ashamed of hallelujah praise god i don't care i said to my people i wouldn't care of them the pope was there all the cardinals was there and all the bishops were there said don't go in there amen it wouldn't bother me friends because i tell you i know who i am i know what i've got i know where i'm going and that's the way it is bless the lord so he come in that's right brother samuel and he came in he came into uh he came into pharaoh and of course pharaoh says there would have been a young man and he says to him he said oh he said you know he's an old man here and uh he said what is your year i think he said 110 120 or whatever it was and uh he said yes and what do you do he said i'm a shepherd amen and joseph must have been said oh what did he say that for you know but that said because it was the truth that's what he was and and he said what are you and he said the years of my pilgrimage he admitted to pharaoh that i'm just a pilgrim and a stranger here and i'm seeking a city to come said how do you know that because he said that joseph you swear by the lord god almighty that you'll not bury me down in egypt you get me right up there hallelujah to die and be buried with my grandfather and my father amen because there's going to be a resurrection one day and i'm going to be in it amen well you say oh praise the lord so that means i should get to the undertaker and say how much would it cost to get me transported over to jerusalem we don't have to worry about that friends because i'll tell you why because brother branham said let me be buried in christ just let me be buried if i am there one day that voice will speak hallelujah and i'll tell you it says we'll hear it amen and we will come forth out of the grave wonderful and so they were seeking a city to come you know and and you see he never found it he never found it amen and uh though he looked and you know sometimes the bible says they died not having they received the promise but not seeing the fulfillment of the promises and yet of all here we are and we've got you see we have to remember that that abraham didn't have the book of revelation you know but we've got the book of revelation and i think i told you last year i made it but i certainly heard it that uh and i believe it so much that i checked it out in the book shop that the catholic church want to take out the book of revelation out of their bible amen that's just too much for them so the best thing to do is what they always do take it out would anybody notice absolutely not why because the priest has never preached from the book of revelation in his life he's never read from the book of revelation in his life and that's the way it is you see so praise god but it's our book hallelujah it's our book and john saw it john saw what abraham did not see he saw the city hallelujah and he was all represented of amen i tell you friends if i say this if you remember nothing else just remember that you go into your computer you'll find it where brother brown says one man can rap us out of whole people and you look at john being our representative amen being there what he saw from from even when he opens the gospel where does he start he starts with the eternal god and the beginning was the word he doesn't start at bethlehem manger he starts right at the beginning hallelujah and that's why because the bread is he's a representative of is what he saw hallelujah and get your priorities right amen and that was the first event and then he says the word became flesh amen so it's so wonderful i've gone through the songs uh sorry the the letters that he wrote every time i read it now i read it with a new perspective john because he was my representative he was there uh you know i was like what i said to the people just say you know they opened i know they opened the white house and again for visitors and just say uh brother samuel said look i'll tell you what ah we'd like you'd like to find out what's in the white house we're gonna set up brother weird and so brother wade goes up he's allowed to take all his videos his camera and work and photographs he comes down and he's saying look this is this is the west wing here this is lincoln room this is where the president was laid out now and you're watching that and you're seeing that why he saw it you never saw it but he did he's coming back he said this is what i saw and he's telling you as it is and that's exactly what happened with john john saw it this is the way it is hallelujah and he saw the lord amen fell in his feet is dead then he saw the seven stars he saw the seven churches thus saith the lord wonderful and they come right into through chapter four chapter five the one that sat on the throne the creator for thou art for thou hast created all things wonderful things and he came right on through right onto revelation 10 right onto the end of the great tribulation amen praise god i i'll never forget saying to the i i will share this with you send to the uh the ambassador about that you know we've been having fellowship for from half seven to half 11 at night and that's not too bad for an ambassador of a nation hey man now do you listen let me put it like put this in perspective do you think the ambassador of america to ireland would give me five minutes brother you you might say the one below the one below the one you know uh but you ain't going to see the man himself and here i'm sitting from half seven and a half eleven with the ambassador of israel to ireland amen and i remember saying to him i said ambassador i said i wish with all my heart i wish i could say to you all is well you've reached the spot as peace forevermore i said but i'm sorry it doesn't say that in your bible it does not it says every nation will come against you don't forget it it's thus saith the lord amen he said you know more about it than i do i said i'm only quoting your bible but every nation will surround jerusalem jerusalem will fall my goodness but he will come dying your messiah will come down and place his feet on the mount of olives hallelujah then we'll see it happening amen bless god well hallelujah so it's so wonderful amen to see it and he saw he saw that millennial reign of christ he saw the great amen and i don't have any at the minute but they brought out a new little uh five-year-old note and you don't see her but if you lift it up to the light there's europa amen you wrote by the beast amen and uh praise the lord uh europe and the woman riding the beast it's all there if you can only see it amen praise the lord anyway and that great inspiration of god tells us what john saw this is brother branham speaking tells us that the home is just beyond the gloom amen where we all go it's there somewhere you know it's hard to believe isn't it today that maybe 20 feet above your head there's another dimension maybe 20 all your loved ones brother gary and you know what oh my goodness that's there hallelujah it's real amen sometimes the lord will let the empty off and he's calm and just get close to you because you know i want i want to just say this this is under inspiration and uh you know brother branham was over there in tucson and one of the brothers i forget his name uh just right now but he had a garage and a a place he sold the fuel and fixed cars and whatnot and uh uh you know brother brother was getting gospel one night and he said um my you've done really well here it's really looking nice and he said yeah brother brown and god's really blessed it we appreciate it he said but i wish daddy could see it and the prophet just said to him turn around and he said you know something he said your loved ones are only as close as you want them to be so i'll tell you what you know that that should you know now we're not trying to contact the dead you know we're not talking about necromancy or nothing we're only telling you the truth hallelujah amen sometimes you can feel hallelujah that they're close to you amen and it's wonderful amen praise the lord so that great inspiration tells us now you know thank god we were singing today what would the church be like if we didn't sing right you know i mean what would the church i know back home or certain people don't believe in music and they well they believe in singing but it's all you know top top and somebody leads them off and i can't or whatever not i don't know music amen and i just wonder what bible they read amen when you read in the old testament about god amen and about leading the army out and everybody playing and certain and singing and praising god i don't know what bible they're at i say oh that's the old testament amen but i tell you what not all that is within me praise his holy name i only wish i'd had a thousand times to praise the lord i only wish that i i could go back to 21 again and say yeah i've got another 40 years to serve the lord i'd love that amen praise god it's wonderful amen and the inspirations and the songs we sing this is all you anything that you want in this message you just tap it in and you'll get it on your computer amen the famous uh poet william kuiper you know the song that he wrote amen brother brother said i stood out his grave a few months ago i just couldn't help shedding a few tears for that man amen there's a prophet amen shedding tears for william kuiper had been dead 100 more years and uh praise the lord uh he was considered in england a neurotic you know a little nervous you know and preachers are a little bit nervous you know they're nervous to be around and and so uh here he was and and hari would go under inspiration and finally he went into the inspiration and wrote that lovely song there is a fountain filled with blood why would inspiration something struck that man when he penned them words and we've got them and he doesn't know that they've been sang all over the world hallelujah people have signed students song that song there is a fern and drawn from emmanuel's vegans drawn to the blood of god amen and sinners plunged beneath that fund you know maybe there's some of our young people here never really trusted the lord for salvation but sinners anybody can plunge beneath that blood and lose their guilty stings it's clorox didn't do this it'll wash away all them stains amen of course there's times like we know in the life of elijah he stood there even mocked the prophets of baal you know that and uh and yet after that when the inspiration lifted off him then he heard jezebel's going to kill me he fled he fled but you know it's a lovely story and i'm not going into today so i hear was this man writing that amen tried to commit suicide and everything couldn't find the river because of the fog so you see so god is in her ways and you know just more that's wonderful praise the lord and uh look what he says brother branham says uh harry eddy paranot uh when he was persecuted in everything and what he thought he wrote amen ah when the inspiration hit him he picked up his pen and wrote that a lovely inauguration song all heal the power of jesus name that's a great name why you say why because he says in my name you shall cast it devils hallelujah i've done it hallelujah and my name shall you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and my name hallelujah that's what it is there's the power that's the devil knows that amen and if you get the faith to use the power then you're in business with god amen absolutely that's the currency of heaven amen sure it is amen oh my i look at john newton what he wrote amazing grace how sweet the sun you know uh they say that it was shipwrecked near ireland near off their east coast up at los swelle it's a beautiful lock but when you get out to the mouth of it that's where their ship went down and apparently you know when people hit you uh they just let you go so when he fell overboard he was kind of thinking well maybe i'll get picked up here again you know but somebody threw over some kind of a harpoon or something with a rope on it and he grabbed it and he was pulled up just like when jeremiah i loved jeremiah and when jeremiah was sinking in the mirror he probably thought this is it this is it but dear god that's okay and just as he was thinking this person looked over in the still of the night and he dropped down the rope he said you put that underneath and jeremiah hooked it around and he pulled him out amen see god knows what he's doing no matter if at the end is a martyr and it don't matter amy and god knows what he's doing hallelujah amen an old dear fanny crosby you know praise the lord the prophet talks about her here uh you know uh she may have been a preacher and short hair but she had no eyes to see with and yet she could write them inspirational songs amen praise god i shall know him i shall know him amen praise the lord just by the nail prince in his hand if i was still i'd just say let me feel your hand feel them then nail prince and his hand and of course she wrote that beautiful song past me not a gentle savior if that ain't inspired what is folks what a wonderful past may not you know uh there is a story about that and i don't know i've ever told you but she was up there and our pastor was wandering her to write a song for for for the easter services and uh she she kind of um he said i want the theme is to pass me narrow gentle savior so uh that was the thing to be of it and she couldn't get nothing because it's like everything i'm when i'm stood in the bible sometime i'm i'm praying the lord please give me inspiration tell you you can't get a brother samuel you can't get it we know it as us preachers here until god opens it up and then when he does oh my it takes off and and here she was and she could get nothing and the pastor looked at her and he knew she was worried about it she said don't worry it'll come and she was all worried was you know and uh they went over to sing saying prison and there she went over and they used to go and visit the prisoners and they all came out brought out you know and the prisoners were all there and they were in prayer and one prisoner cried out he said ah not just past me he cried out lord he said hear my humble cry oh that was it that's all he said hear my humble cry and she had her next line that's it pass me naru gentle savior hear my humble cry while in others don't pass me by the lord don't pass me by amen and she got it now the stream of all my comfort more than life to me who have i on her beside thee who in heaven but they and you know i love that one i old charles wesley he was looking for inspiration too and he walked along the big beach and it got really uh rough windy stormy and uh and he was going along there and the next thing into his cloak a little bird flew just right in and it didn't panic it just settled down got the wings tucked back there and settled in and john charles already kind this little bird and he said well there he is he don't care about new storm anymore and that's what he would hide me oh my savior hide tell the storms of life be passed you know wow uh what wonderful inspiration amen praise god see brother ben said faith struck down in his bosom amen till the storms are passed amen and uh bless the lord i talked about hopkins writing rock of ages a beautiful song amen let me hide myself in me and uh gilmore talked about this man i'll go on in a moment but these are lovely to think of you know and gilmore amen uh what do you think about him he was a restless man he was all the way through england over there in different places and one day when inspiration struck him and christ come into his heart he wrote them lovely songs i've angered my soul in a haven of rest i'll sail the wild winds no more the tampas might sweep over the deep stormy deep but in jesus i'm safe ever more inspiration people that struck that man amen and praise god uh wonderful hallelujah i'm safe in jesus evermore there was a man called laurel and uh what would you think here's what he would say my faith looks up to me thou lamb of calvary amen savior divine now hear me while i pray take all my guilt away and let me from this day be wooly iron and then brother branham talked about paul reater he said he didn't paul radar never never realized that that song would go all around the world only believe all things are possible you know you really don't believe that i really don't believe that all things are possible you know oh well we kind of believe it you know but boy i'll tell you what we wouldn't be prepared to step into it you know it's like the fella that was coming over to niagara falls and he walked over on the rope and he had this kind of wheelbarrow you know and the rubber off and he wheeled across and he got over to one side he said to the folks do you believe i could do that again and everybody said oh yeah yeah no problem you've done it says sir do you believe i could do it he said oh yeah i've no doubt you could he said jump and i'll take you over i'll tell you if you really believe he could do it amen i started oh lord hallelujah oh i believe lord me yeah you know i believe lord you know and if he turns around and he says jump and i'll take you over you say i'll put lord you're going a bit too far there you know hallelujah praise god wonderful and i'll just finish off with this there's so many hymns you know i was even thinking about i said i better not put any more in because i'll be running out of time and space you know but so many lovely hymns that are inspired and i'll i'll say a little bit uh more and more in a moment but uh you know i know paul redder when he come to die and maybe they were singing that i'd say that was fine and maybe they were singing near my god today on the titanic you know that was fine but i'll tell you what he's called over to his brother he said come on in here what is it what is it he said look who's dying near you you know you know who's down here me or you you know and he said yeah yeah yeah he said what do you want he said i want you to play some good gospel music fiat flip the music hallelujah you have to hear you sing one of the old good old songs you know and that's that is wonderful praise the lord amen and they did they struck up a good old song amen he felt a lot better after that i can tell you amen okay so you know they're wonderful but what the whole point is inspiration inspiration god wants you you can be inspired by a song a day you read something that just inspires you to go out face the world hallelujah amen and and face all that the words in there you know now god wants you to fulfill this program uh praise the lord there's certain things must happen must be fulfilled and they must be accomplished amen and god the only hands he's got down here is his hands amen our feet are our lips amen the voice of god's in us amen praise the lord not i don't want to get too kind away there because i remember brother ronald and you know sometimes it's hard you're preaching hard like that and you go back to the motel you can't sleep he said brother if i could preach the word he said i speak the word he said i speak myself asleep so you know just just check it out just check it out the next time you're all filled with it oh yeah well if you can't sleep just speak to yourself and see if you can speak the word or not okay see because you got to balance you got to keep the balance you know i'll say something about that a moment too you know but these things have to be accomplished amen and the prophet said above all things i wouldn't you prosper and be in health see that that the the scriptures writers were inspired by the holy spirit to write that amen and it was given by inspiration uh of god and it says like all scripture that scripture is true so folks i'll tell you what if you said to me do you really believe god wants me to be in health that's the word of god i preached this morning i preached my heart it's telling you that we're to believe every word and it says right here above all things beloved i desire see christians don't have to wish for anything you know i desire that you be in health amen coming straight from the pain of the holy spirit that's his desire that's what we should be walking into by the confession bringing our body into that confession amen no matter what the fight is just keep pressing on into that amen so praise the lord that's what he was and he will fulfill his program amen bless god he always does i love to fulfill my program and uh i do and i love to get to the end of the program and just get on that jet you know come come thursday god willing you'll remember me for the rest of the time i'm here this thursday i hope to be up in new york city i'd go straight in over to ireland over the atlantic again and uh to be home on friday this week amen and it's good to be back and gee it's good to be back home again i'll tell you what amen okay nice so praise the lord um amen night it can't fail see i can feel i'm a man but when he speaks that inspiration that's the way it will always be that way it never fails and it's wonderful you know this is the thing about experience when you experience god amen in your life and you know harry operates and you know he never fails her brother samuel and he could say well i failed i could say i failed but to the lord i cannot say and i'm being honest that the lord's ever failed i don't know where he's ever feel me no matter where it was on the mission field no matter where it was he's never failed amy and he keeps all his appointments he's always there hallelujah and he has never failed and that's what the prophet said if it's by inspiration it will not fail amen praise the lord now amen there's a little thing here and he goes on and he says when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness and i'm not on just the vain healing i just want to get this inspiration idea over uh when you receive from heaven that jesus died for your sins and accept it you don't need prayer any longer for men you already accepted it it's settled there was a man came to brother branham said brother brown i've been everywhere i've been to this church that church this minister that minister and i just don't know where to turn amen and they're saying this that and the other and uh brother brought him looked at him and he said uh well tell me your story and he told him and he said could i ask you a question said sure brother branham he said when did you get the desire oh brother brother was a certain time and this happened and and i just got the desire you know to start he said brother you got it right there right there that's where you got it that's where it was settled hallelujah and you know it's wonderful because that's how the centurion happened you know the very r that he spoke that word amen has a servant he doesn't doesn't even say that he spoke it that very our his servant was healed amen so she'll sometimes say things happen in your heart and i'll tell you it's not very r and then you go on maybe next week oh lord would you do this but it's already happened as far as he's concerned and that's where the inspiration will come in to show you what's happened and to step out and use your faith praise god and it's wonderful amen and he said when you receive the word hallelujah then what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation something slips out of the unseen the unseen hand amen something slips out of that world amen yonder comes rolling down through that mystical channel somewhere into your soul that's it the word that's the whole thing brother you know the mind and the mental mind is wonderful but when it falls through that right into your soul hallelujah uh brother branham says your eyes will brighten your lips that hung down will straighten up you'll smile every muscle in your body will just rejoice something's happened and you know it hallelujah you don't need the prayer line or nothing in that's fact that's a fact hallelujah praise god and uh amen when you receive the inspiration that jesus died that's the r that came amen praise the lord when you receive the inspiration he's your savior he's your shepherd he's your baptizer in the holy ghost you know your guide your bridegroom that's the hour hallelujah that it comes to you and i'm sure that not one of us here today is sitting here that we can look back and when you come into the bride as it were when you uh in your knowledge said i accept that hallelujah right there it was sealed amen to you amen from god eternal ever seen the way back then and even put your name in it but i tell you now it's sealed to you you know uh when he comes in hallelujah at what point in your life it's all wonderful amen now all scripture is inspired by god all scripture i love that not just some of it as i remember talking to the israeli ambassador's wife and i don't know how we get onto the subject about mo about abraham and sarah and she said moses could have had to be wrong to write that in that a 100 year old man should have a child and a 90 year old woman had to be wrong that that's that's a corruption of the text you know i said really she said well it had to be brother i mean you surely you don't believe that i said well sister surely i do believe it you know amen oh you're wrong man i said no no i said no no i said why could god not have intervened and give them a child why could now we know an old man like that no woman couldn't have a child so god had to do something didn't he and you know god doesn't patch you up some way you know and then and you know what i'm talking about so he had to change them back folks amen and he did change them back and and and she said do you believe that i said your bible tells me that because when they went down to the abimelech he wanted to marry her amen so you see there it is amen and and praise the lord this this is what we believe amen when when you accept that all scripture is inspired of god even that scripture and i said to her if that's wrong how can you have confidence in any part of it see that's the whole point it's not right for the weird that's the whole point you've got to have confidence in everything that you read coming from the mouth of god and believe every word that's one thing about the bride brother samuel absolutely this bride believes it from genesis to revelation hallelujah i've never noticed that i something up here at the back of the church saying if you speak in tongues you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you know we don't put up skidman so let god we believe all the bible hallelujah every last bit of it amen that's the revelation of the word when you get that you'll know you have the holy ghost amen hallelujah i don't know some pentecostals i don't know could you if you'd lived in moody's day that man winning thousands and thousands of souls to christ and say ah mr murder like to talk to you you haven't got the holy ghost that would be real yeah brother dick what do you think hey man you know finney you know you just had a revival you went into a factory every last one of them t-heading and laughing and smirking and you started to pray the next thing is they're all on their knees oh god have mercy on me but he didn't have the holy ghost brother why why is it oh he never spoke in tongues well maybe this bigger things i don't know but i'll tell you one thing see how it goes folks amen now i all scripture amen is given by inspiration you know it's profitable for doctrine i preached on it one sunday morning in the church for doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness and every one of them that's where we get all our doctrine it's in the scriptures hallelujah and it's wonderful amen and that spirit that's in mind we are a spirit you know we don't look i don't care i could i don't know how people could believe that man has not got a spiritual part to him i mean it's so obvious that we have a spiritual part you say well what is that i mean when you were born even as a child nobody's speaking to you you wanted to reach out and touch something greater than yourself amen there was no physical explanation it was just something that was there crying out even as a little child you know i remember playing out like that there and so what was that you know what what was that you know and then i come into the message and brother brother is telling me oh yes your engines were darn run about you that day watching over you as a little child you know certainly hallelujah and that spirit there is a spirit in mind and job was a great man amen and he says praise the lord that is the inspiration of god amen praise the lord gives that man understanding to that spirit that's in him and that's where we are today amen uh jesus said that heaven and earth will pass away as i said this morning uh and his word wouldn't so i'm glad we're you know um sometimes you stand on a building and sometimes you think it's a great building and you come later on to find out the knocked it down so why well because it wasn't structurally signed but you know when you're on something that you can trust but you can put an anchor to your soul hallelujah you can rest your whole eternal destiny on this word of god amen praise the lord and uh you know the prophet said that god will not vindicate a liar think about that one he'll not vindicate a liar praise the lord but his own word he said i tell you the truth this is the truth i am the truth amen i'm not which is according to the facts amen according to the facts that's what truth is praise the lord so let me just go on here and paul was inspired i think we mentioned it a little bit today was inspired to write the new testament moses wrote the old testament and paul right there out in arabia and he wrote and set all these things in order now if i took the book of hebrews out of the new testament if you take it out you've got 13 books by paul and you know god's not glorified in 13. 13 is rebellion amen but 49. so we put the 14th one in there to paul and i'm sure he did write it and you know he took all the types and shadows of the old and brought them right into the new testament amen and praise god uh what a wonderful thing it is to see it all and the people of march see all that there uh and read it and just let it bless your soul amen and he got it three and a half years in arabia he said man didn't teach me it he said i got the old testament i went in there with it and god however he did it the same as brother brought him in the sails every morning how that pillar fire came down and revealed it and the apostle wrote it down and he gave us the book of hebrews now what would you be like if you didn't have that book tell you you'd be really handicapped you'd be really handicapped amen praise the lord amen and uh he said all the old testament shadow he said it all in order he set the whole thing in order and god honored it that's the thing about it amen and we'll talk about brother branham in arizona uh later just about when he was in the desert amen but praise god that bible is revealed by inspiration and praise the lord that's what he told peter upon this rock i'll build my church the rock of inspiration folks you need more than just read it you can read it i'll tell you as fast as you can i remember one time and i don't say this is a no funny joke there was two fishermen drowned it and i knew one of their families one of the members and um they were coming to be buried and it was a kind of winter time and um so the priest he uh got as far as the cemetery that was next time to turn up and uh when he got there you know they they say the lord's prayer well i'll tell you what and i i mean this with all my heart i never heard anybody pray out as fast as he did and i what i mean by that he's standing over his umbrella up and it's snowing a little bit there's these people they're in respect and i was one of them there's the coffins and or the caskets you call them here and uh and uh here he starts the lord's prayer i've had a resort in our neighborhood hey man and he was gone that's what he thought about it you know there's some inspiration there wasn't her there was a last a nice last closing closing word for the families right there wouldn't it yeah but he's an old man and you know so anyway praise the lord amen upon this rock that's the rock of revelation of who he is and you know look at it you look everybody in this church right and here's brother canada all the different ones amen every one of us and look how you come in how did you come in when god revealed who jesus christ is and he revealed what you are and you came in hallelujah upon what upon what you saw amen about what you saw he was and that's where he's built this church from the day one you know i've often told people we had a a catholic girl come in there uh her sister i baptized and she got her to church this uh her other sister she got her to church and uh you know when we were we we preached about jesus uh the unwelcome christ uh that morning mostly that she could uh hear something that she could relate to amen and she loved the service she loved the simplicity of it and i was telling her i said you know if you go back on the records and see how they had church i said this is how they did it this is how they did it they would have had a song so therefore they're doing the song leader and you know that whatever way they're saying turn in the catacombs or whatever and then the press butter would come up later and he would preach the word of god to them that's never changed amen when they were going to have a baptism or service there's the water and came the candidate brother justice whatever you know i or pastor whatever i'm going to baptize you today in the name of the lord jesus christ on confession of your faith that's the way they did it the same as we do it so we've all been built on the same rock of revelation yes we have amen it's wonderful praise the lord amen nye ah yes i i just go on i just go on there if i may praise the lord because i hope not to hold you too long today but amen brother branham says uh where did the dove come from when he was in the wilderness my my where did that dove come you know i walked that trail up there and uh i walked that trail and um a dove up there it's almost incredible that even a dog would have would have appeared there and folks i don't know where it came from i don't know if god spoke that dove or not but i know he could have well done so because he's god but all i know is there was a snow white dog waiting there and i'm so glad because his mama had dreamed a dream of the six the six doves uh brother aaron this morning was sharing with me a story about the dream amen and about hard things opened up god does speak to you in dreams there's no doubt about that and uh and he said i always knew there would be a seventh of and there was and he gave us that precious precious message you know if you're having an interview with brother branham and you say he said what do you think of the messenger coming up to when he's about to leave the scene he'll be shot at he'll be blasted out he'll be spoken against he'll be wounded but he'll get the message in hallelujah that that dove will come over and get the message in hallelujah bring the message and that's all he said my whole life now is to bring the message and to get it out to the people amen and i'm glad he succeeded on the wings of a snow white dove and i think we heard that today as well amen so it's wonderful and i want to tell you something else you know just in a moment about that amen not only the dove but something else there and it's wonderful praise the lord and when brother joe green was over uh with us in ireland and he preached a message uh the part of your need you know you all got needs today every i've got needs you've got needs but there's power in your need you say what do you mean powering your knees well because if you've got a need you have to look around to see who's going to meet it and when you look to the lord you've come to the right place whether the lord uses a doctor or whatever he uses you've come to the right place amen and and god has the power to meet your need there's a power calling on there's a voice calling out and god has got that and brother joe was saying you know uh the bible says that the ram was caught in a thicket now we think oh hallelujah you know the ram was there and all you know but the god that knew what he needed knew he also needed a thicket amen now okay let's just say brother samuel go on again see because you're so deep what you're talking about this morning you know let's say there hadn't been any thicket there well maybe he would have had the lamb just standing there i don't know but he needed to be caught in a ticket so god created a thicket for that ram to be caught up now folks i'll tell you what don't you tell me that god doesn't know your need right because i know he does and not only that there but you know whatever that need would be if you would need a little thicket he'll provide that as well hallelujah he'll do the lot hallelujah he's not a half-hearted god and when he does it it'll be done hallelujah and he'll meet your need perfectly because that is his promise amen that god would meet all you need in christ jesus that's what paul says so we love that amen now do you believe that you got what you asked for does something in your heart tell you do you feel that little spark of inspiration there's the sisters came out this morning praise god that little spack of inspiration sister that's it where people get out of the way hallelujah well you're in the presence of almighty god and he says do you believe that you say yes sir i believe it hallelujah then be it on to me according to your word amen hallelujah and you touch something hallelujah that no education or or university or no sadness could tell you anything about but you've touched something that's real hallelujah and something will happen never fails never feels amen my brother brother talked about uh murray i believe it was mary this particular time he's speaking he said something inspired her you know my she didn't realize he's going to go down to this uh this old pharisee and all the forest he wants you know is to make fun of him bring a few of his friends there and come on we'll have a good laugh at this guy you know and we'll not offer him any water for his feet you know we will not wash him wash his hands or anoint them with oil and put the special shoes on and a garment and and give him the hug and give him the kiss we'll not do that we'll just treat him like dirt because that's what we believe he is but he'll come and we'll have a good laugh and that's what they thought and when this we woman come in just came in why because the prophet said inspiration struck her inspiration she said there he has a need he has a need amen and he needed a service and i'm going to do it and she came in and i'll tell you what she got read up there and she anointed him amen and they stood back because they didn't believe you know i was reading a a book on the life of christ by one of the old scottish divines and he was saying you know something he said you take the torah take the torah you know all the torah really is and they call it the law but all the torah really is from the uh from the hebrew point of view is the thoughts of the rabbis so this rob i thought this and this rabbi i thought that and this other rob i thought this and eventually when you get the whole concoction together you can't wash your hands or you have to wash your hands or you have to do this you have to do that and you've got a rule of laws and jesus just said woe unto you hypocrites what you've done to the people you've took that pure word of god and you put your own interpretation onto it hallelujah and instead of making the children of god what they ought to be you've made this house your house and he said i'll tell you it's desolate and it sure was hypocrisy called them and that's why folks that's why you don't want to come to the word of god and put your own interpretations and do we do it this way because because what because what amen we're not interested in what hallelujah we want to know what we're doing it for amen and she did it he needed a service and she went on her inspiration and of course being hypocrites they said oh if he knew what modern woman that was well he didn't know hallelujah and when he saw you he looked beyond your fault hallelujah but i stole he looked beyond your fault hallelujah but i fell when i was a young woman he looked beyond your fault sister i ain't not your need hallelujah and he looked beyond my fault and he met my name hallelujah oh grace i tell you amen chris it's wonderful just wonderful it's wonderful praise the lord amen i'll tell you what he had no head said the son of man no nowhere to put his head but i'll tell you what in the room as i said here before john the type of the bride put her head right here right here he put his head right here on the breast of jesus christ could hear his heartbeat amen he said lord who's going to betray you and he told him read it oh peter knew he couldn't do that that's right you go up to the catholic church and one of the guys and ask them you know what's the revelation literally oh brother we had a big council there and uh the pope stood up and said he's very sorry for all the abuse you know and all this stuff my my i tell you the government in ireland they're going to pay back a lot of people they took young girls have a young girl got pregnant or anything like that she was put into a laundry and it was almost like a prison to her and i'll tell you what they spoil many many lives like that these people have all told their stories now amen and i tell you that the government said we're going to give them reimbursement for all that was wrong that was done the church knew it was wrong the police knew it was wrong the government knew it was wrong and they let them young men and women be persecuted like that and now it's payback time hallelujah you know charlie spencer up there he says we done wrong we done and we're paying for it now that's right over here in this country and i'll tell you what so now the government are hunting the catholic church to pay back the reimbursements on what they did hallelujah on the people they abused the priests and also on these they called the mind magalin laundries where these young people were put into if you're a wee bit uh mental or anything like god or but on range that's where they put you into get you out of the way you see and they did that and you know how they did it on the word of a priest that's the only one a girl could be there sitting in the house and the people come along the police the priest had signed it off and off she went she had no say where she was going how long should stay there nothing but i'm not here to preach about that amen but i know one thing praise god hallelujah uh he had no place to lay his head and john let his head there and i'll tell you we've given them on fleece hallelujah you know we've kissed the sun just like like what they wouldn't do them pharisees we know how to do it we know how to wash his feet how do we do it watch each other's feet amen praise the lord that's how you do it amen and how you would stand there put your hand on his shoulder and there and then you would kiss hallelujah and that's how we kiss the son amen praise the lord okay let me go on very very fast praise the lord you're very good and god bless you this afternoon amen you know moses in this crisis he cried out we found it in exodus 14 13 and to verse 16 and he was in a great strain sometimes you can be under great strain nobody's debating that but it's what you're going to do hallelujah when you're there amen that's where you're going to turn your eyes to what you're going to do amen and in the crisis he cried out amen and the inspiration struck him and he didn't even know what he was supposed to say that i love that you don't know what you're going to say amen i'm when god speaks through your lips hallelujah brother brahma said not sister whatever he said to you he didn't even know what he said but whatever he said to you it wasn't me but whatever he said that's the truth of course it's the truth it's always going to be the truth amen it's wonderful amen and he said stand still to the people stand still don't be don't be all fussed up and stand still and see the salvation of god amen you don't have the answer i don't have the answer how's the sea going to open he's got the answer you stand still and watch what he's going to do amen and how he did it amen that great east wind and just divided the sea and it really did hallelujah it really did amen and that praise god you see uh there was the inspiration struck him the inspiration struck asia you know how would you put that out what would it be like here a brother brother samuel perudo a little flyer somewhere and said something like this and by the way a virgin's gonna conceive you know and we're a child and she won't know about but she's gonna conceive you say oh we better look up brother samuel you know he's going away there's isaiah wrote that down in black and white one of the great we talked about israel a lot better sound myself one of the great things that i found when i was in israel i got the opportunity to go up to the hebrew university they've got it the building's like a scroll big scroll sticking in there and it's a round shape and in there it's a lovely case and it's all air temperature control and all that you know what i mean and the whole way around it might not be the whole book of isaiah but i'll tell you what exactly it's the oldest book that they've got on the isaiah it's about three thousand or two thousand three thousand years of age it's an old old book and there you can get it translated and it's exactly what you've got in your bible today so that's it and there it is that very scripture behold a virgin shall conceive brother branham said did he know what he was writing absolutely but hallelujah hid the inspiration to write it amen praise god it's wonderful hallelujah amen brother branham when he talked about capernaum capernaum amen and and california and he come out and when he come out of it all he said to billy paul what did i say to those people he said was i mean to them and and billy paul said no dad you weren't mean to them amen but there was the prophecy had one died and you'll sink like a stone amen i'll tell you one thing i believe it i believe it sir i tell you what hallelujah praise god yes i do amen nine it's so wonderful amen i finished work amen once spoken see that's it that's the thing about god you know i can say to you look i'll come back next year anything could happen i might get back but you know when god says it it's thus saith the lord it's going to happen hallelujah amen a channel of inspiration just like job sitting there on the ice sheep amen will not establish the whole key to the book of job is that day when inspiration struck him like god hallelujah when he loved to his feet and said look i know that my redeemer lives and i know that even if the skin worms will eat this flesh i know that in my flesh i will see god hallelujah that's wonderful that's that's that's where we are folks that's that's the people that we are in this day and age amen praise god a channel of inspiration that's what he said when it's opened up to you and you you know what i i mean this even to the youngest to the oldest tomorrow you could be just there sitting in your home and god could open a channel of inspiration just to say some little thing that will inspire you amen for to go on amen and he needed that and when it drops into your heart oh my hallelujah see the lightning flash and the thunder's going and all that there but you know when it drops into your heart he begin to see god's reaction to his faith as i told you this morning he begin to see god's reaction to his faith and if you want that quote you just take that down word for word and pop it up in your computer it'll come up amen so praise the lord that's what job began to say i love that because i know god will react to faith i know faith pleases god wonderful to say lord i believe you hallelujah i believe you'll be there with me i believe you know i i loved it what brother said the other night i don't know if you got this or not he said but you know the devil's not as smart as he seems you know and you say hi come he said well look when he came to schambach there were 600 philistines or whatever there were nigh praise the lord so when inspiration had shambak hallelujah schambach realized that one can cut down ten thousand so so the devil was really six hundred from ten thousand you got about nine hundred and nine thousand four hundred short before he would even come up to as many as was with schambach amen so he's not that smart he loves he likes to pretend he's like a lion like in the book of uh uh the pilgrim progress and he was there going along and he heard their lion roar and he stopped and he said i'll check this out he saw the lion what am i going to do here how am i going to get lost so anyway there was just enough faith in him this pilgrim to get a little closer and you know the closer you get the lighter the line can roar and here as he was going along he realized something all the lines roar but he noticed it was chained there you are folks he'll make a lot of noise you know circumstances i i've got some notes down there on fear oh boy fear's a real thing you know i know he'll make a lot of noise and and i'll tell you what he does but you know something if you realize he's tuned you know and i'll never forget i come back i come back from vietnam and said you know folks i'll prove one thing i proved that i was in the la i was in the lion's mouth but isn't it wonderful folks to prove that he couldn't close his mouth that's the victory hallelujah that's the victory oh i was there i know i was there but he couldn't close the night he couldn't finish the job hallelujah but it would god he'll finish the job amen okay well the prophet talks about the mechanics and the dynamics and i just want to mention a few more things try and get it over with this morning this afternoon amen but praise the lord it is like a big train you know you see a big train and i noticed a little trainer near samuel's house yesterday just sitting there going to be done up you know but that that it's there for a purpose i know that but that ain't going to move it amen it has to be fired up it can sit there 35 coaches on the track but until it gets the dynamics amen ain't going nowhere amen and that's like you it's like you're a little motor automobile until uh it uh gets the dynamics amen it ain't going nowhere it needs out it needs the firing power amen and brother branham said it he said if you get into the presence of the pillar of fire and let your fire amen so you know something i know it's fairly hot but i'll tell you what folks i know one thing for sure that you won't get any heat from a painted fire somebody can paint a lovely fire get the colors right everything and you go up and try and warm yourself don't work don't work hallelujah but the real fire does work amen the real fire hallelujah i'm so glad i can send one of them ah they were winning a noble room that was real fire amen and that the power of fire let your fire amen praise god amen hallelujah so we're waiting for the dynamics just like uh like enoch amen uh a walk with god we're walking with god and the day comes whenever it's gonna be however it's gonna be but i'll tell you what amen when it comes brother branham says then you'll know amen it'll be there for you and it'll happen amen so we're just waiting for the dynamics that will take her off the earth that's right that's what we're waiting for amen here's the dynamics and praise the lord we're the members we're the machine he's the body and the holy ghost is the fire that's going to take us there uniting himself with us and uh amen before the wedding supper and we're waiting and we're watching for that glad millennial day it's coming amen now i said earlier on you know moses was in the desert i told you this morning paul was in the desert he got the new testament brother branham was also in the desert is that right that's why god took him right over to arizona get him away from all man and get him right up there in that desert desert mountains amen where he could deal and talk with his prophet praise the lord and that's exactly what he what he did amen and uh people talk about the cloud picture folks what about the revelation of the seven seals amen what about that hallelujah praise god you know and i i think i've got it down somewhere amen but the critics i i haven't heard any critics about the seven sales i don't know you haven't nobody's ever said oh i don't believe that you know because i'll tell you why because too many denominations are borrowed from it and so therefore therefore they're not going to deny it because say pastor you preached that last week but they just don't say they got it from brother branham that's that that's the truth see but there thus saith the lord amen and there he was amen and the books are sealed with seven seals it will also require the same wilderness experience as paul and he's talking about there in the old testament and moses and paul so there you are and that's how it came he said i believe in these days to open those seven sales amen now i'll go down a little bit more but i've been studying on the book of daniel one of the churches wants me to preach in the book of daniel and it's been hard going i can tell you that it really has been hard going but i'm nearly there by the grace of god and the conclusion i drew is that we know more about the book of daniel sister regina than daniel did now there's something hallelujah when you can go up to the author of a book and say hey buddy i know more about that you knew they they say oh you should that's terrible you shouldn't speak about the prophet daniel they got him but it's true it is true because the angel said daniel you seal it up to the end time and you stay in your lot well we're at the end time and the prophets came along and all that truth in the book of daniel we've got it today so hallelujah we do know more about the book of daniel and daniel that amen now amen we're joining with word amen see nothing else can do it we know the day that we're living amen and we're looking for that amen the minority group under the inspiration of god this is what he said that's what we're doing you know the whole message has been inspiration folks it's an inspiration amen no matter what you pick up what you read it's just an inspiration amen praise the lord uh do you believe that god is in all inspiration brother brother says amen and god has to read a song do you believe god can write songs i just proved early wrong and not and not and not there amen and brother brown goes on to say he said sure he said jesus referred back to david sure he did to the psalms do you know that david said in the

it's got to be there it's got to be there hallelujah you tell me friends how could that be how can a little boy write that and 40 years later he said it for fell right in front of his very eyes wonderful hallelujah it's god to be there it's not a myth it's a reality a reality all scripture he says that's given by inspiration i'll be too much longer hallelujah must be fulfilled all scripture must be fulfilled is he going to lost one is he gone the last one are you sure you've got your name on that book today what if you're not sure you get up to the altar today hallelujah you want to know that you know that you know that man does not live by bread alone that you are in that book hallelujah i've got no doubts in my heart amen i've given my whole life to this praise god and i'm glad if i had another life i'll do it amen scripture must be fulfilled and he said scripture cannot be broken the lord jesus fulfilled every scripture that pertained to him amen and he says to the jews for anything where did he miss it where did he miss it he tell me i'd love to know if he missed it where did he miss it praise god but we know he didn't miss it amen and you know as he said it's been a blessing to my heart brother samuel to come over hear the different ministers preaching at the camp and whatever not brother iran preaching to me it was a masterpiece the other night hardy took all that but now we would know what it's not it's not rocket science but but to know that you've got a part to play that you've got a part to play you say well what am i mom what are you making me go to church for you've got a part to play young people you've got a part to play god wants you to play your part you old timer for that you know our regards we've got a part to play brother hallelujah it may have been just leading them songs today but you've got a part to play and that's all we want to do is play god's part whatever it is if god wants you to be a housewife you'd be a good one hallelujah you know what brother brahm said look if god makes you a bomber you become a god a bomb written on the stream said you'd be a good one so you know you know what he's saying don't you course today hallelujah beard hoven he was he was deaf death was adored doornail amen and you know like all sculptors and even even uh i think it's the mona lisa they found that there's paintings underneath that where he just used the same yeah so no and uh you know with all good good uh inspiration no doubt he would compose something and he wouldn't have no that just doesn't seem right and he would just spin it amen and uh praise the lord uh he had probably brother brown says his waist basket full of scraps of paper amen but he gave the world masterpieces i was actually listened it was on the radio one day and it was about beethoven and it said i didn't even notice you know and it said that there's one thing that was never done in his day and that is you never open with a piano and here's beardhoven and the boy comes in right on the piano and what did he give them he gave them something they never had before and he gave them a masterpiece hallelujah i hope you're getting the spiritually i'm going to finish up in a minute or not that very theme of spirituality but praise god he did hallelujah he gave the world a masterpiece amen and a masterpieces michelangelo give us moses masterpiece amen and the mother and the son uh he has a masterpiece he gave us there his painting of the sister chapel it just boggles your mind masterpiece amen and praise god how many believes that jesus christ is god's masterpiece yes written on calvary amen and harmony believes that the bride is god's masterpiece today on this earth certainly hallelujah amen i'll tell you i i'm sure i speak for all the ministry but if we're not i'd love to go and find out who is that's a fact amen but we are folks you can rest or not the spoken word is the original seed amen praise the lord certainly it is that little group of the true seed of the word amen that's what he said will present christ amen with a beloved bride amen shall be a virgin to his word you know that scripture very well hallelujah amen and the inspiration will be in her amen and it's the same in second peter so i can drop that where we quoted it this morning amen that men of old were inspired they were moved by the holy ghost amen and that prophecy came not by the will of man but by the will of god now i bless the lord the uh seals on sunset mountain you know there stood those seven angels just as natural as you see me standing here and they told me to return home and the mysteries that the reformers down through the ages that failed to see and pick up because it wasn't the time and here they were they were to be revealed and i challenge anybody to get those seven sales loop them over and find a fault on them see can't do it i still saith the lord hallelujah we're resting on it we love it hallelujah praise god amen prior to that i was preaching on there seven shirt changes and drawed them up there on the blackboard and my tabernacle but in there preaching on the seven church ages and to have a sanction from god drawing them out there on the darkness through the church in nicaea and the messengers and whatnot and it must have been right for as soon as i got them drawn at the last church age sunday morning 11 o'clock the great light came down into the building before almost as many people well there was a good plunders and flickering on the wall each of the seven churches amen just there praise the lord i uh let me tell you this little story before we we would press on ah i'm nearly finished believe me uh i met two boys they're two brothers they lived up in jeffersonville and brother branham was alive went to the tabernacle and they were because it was packed building they were in the nante room when that happened and brother brother then got to the point where he says now if you have not yet seen it then i bid you come anybody anywhere in the building can come right now and see it on the wall so one of these young fellas got up one of the brothers they were twins i believe one of them got up and he walked down right auntie room walked down to see the pillar of fire the other young fella didn't he didn't go now i i wonder what you do if it was you let's say you've been sitting there that morning here's the invitation come down and see us on the wall you're free to come well you might be like inquisitive you say well i'm going to see it this young fella didn't go down to see it so i'll just put it this way to you so he waited there everybody left and he was sitting there and then his brother came back down and brother terence here he is he says uh well did you see it he said yeah he says was it on the wall like brother branham said he said yeah that was it that's all the fellows said about it yeah it was there i saw it amen and he said brother you made us why i never went he said do you want me to tell you why i didn't go he said a brother brother said it was on the wall it was on the wall i didn't have to see it hallelujah now there's something for you amen so many look folks don't be strange or when scoffers say this and you know and predictors predict this and don't be don't be that that's to be that has to happen amen praise god you know and and as like ronald said you know one of them said anyway one of the ministers said you know you can you can hardly remember what you did yesterday and how are you going to question god eternal and eternal god you know you don't know all the facts you weren't there you never seen it but if you believe he was a prophet you believe what he said is the truth hallelujah i believe it i believe he was picked up i really believe that and he was commissioned to go back and open them since and they proved to be thus saith the lord so it's wonderful amen he talked about the moon and all being the same the same as the church ages which is lovely in the church age book so i can pass over that quickly and let me come to a finish today amen i love this you take a whole message out of this put it with anything you want praise the lord how many here have heard me tell uh what happened before it did i think about everybody in the church and that's true you know oh he was over in texas and all that their stuff at the end of december he told the church exactly what happened up there two months later three months later coming into march he told the whole story you say today sirs is this the time go home and read it again go home and listen to it again and you'll find it's exactly what happened as as he explains it amen and so praise the lord he said uh yeah about everybody in the church uh there it is they don't know about it yet the sanders are trying to explain it and they still haven't come up with an answer and so praise the lord a cloud 26 mile high and the ship of a pyramid and seven angels represent brought right back there you the word of god under inspiration it tells you what are that we're coming and living in and that's right because that cloud i've got it here in in my in my folder that cloud is the bride's property hallelujah it's the bride's property praise god because we're the only ones can make sense of it amen we can see that the the the son of man in it we can see the angels wrapping around him amen and we're so thankful to god for that now under inspiration it tells you these are that you're living and coming to and living in and this is what he said folks and i'll be finishing five moments five minutes he said the spiritual mind will pick it up amen there you have it now there is it all in a big nutshell for you see the spiritual mind you go into it carnally try and figure it all out and i'll tell you you'll not know it's just like the time the angel i told him and he's got this shoe and and a big shoelace it ain't going to work amen you can figure out how many often you want it will not work amen but when you get a revelation of it when your spiritual mind catches it hallelujah and you know god's in this i tell you what a wonderful difference amen praise god and you see the spiritual mind will get it and it's an exodus amen we're going to leave one of these days thank god and you know it's true because in romans 8 now listen to it in romans 8 to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace and i want to be spiritually minded sister regina i want to be spiritually minded hallelujah to follow this message to its true end amen my word is truth let every man's be a lie that's what's attracted the prophet and it still does it the word of god always attracts the spiritual mind you know you might say oh i go to church every sunday and that's true but what brings you to church and you know i'm going to tell you if not all of you i tell you there's so many of you here today it's because your spiritual mind is attracted to the word of god amen you can even see prosper samuel brother weird and it's the word of god that attracts you like a magnet you want to be there in the morning you want to see the door open take your seat hallelujah sing the praises of god and get that word amen lay right before you amen that's what you want that's what i want hallelujah it doesn't matter if i'm in indonesia it doesn't matter where i am back home in donegal it doesn't matter if we're a little small handful that is what i want every sunday praise god and you know you've got to have a spiritual mind to understand spiritual things the word the word is spiritual it's interpreted spiritually said that's all he said see but the spiritual mind maybe that they could not understand but these disciples but the spiritual mind will get it amen and and you see says caleb and joshua seen the promises in my last paragraph here he says we're more than able to do it why they were looking to what god said just what i said this morning every word of god go in and take the land amen see and they would have and you know something folks there's no backdoor victories amen they're no armor for the back you know you don't run before your enemies you never do that hallelujah it don't work amen you may say oh well so there caleb didn't have to fight when he went into the promised land because he went in the back door didn't have to fight caleb had to fight every enemy he saw the first time and he still an old man was crying the same word we are able to overcome them hallelujah for with us one is a majority with god we are able to do it and he did it hallelujah the spirits are mine amen the carnal man don't get that the carnal mind don't get the word of god the carnal men don't understand the message i don't understand it you know talking i was reading somebody's objections to brother branham that his grammar was too poor the bible says jesus spoke the language of the common people that the ordinary people could under you know totes and the ants and all that could understand it all hallelujah and then this critic says i but when god was speaking through brother branham he used bad grammar now folks listen here's inspiration today hallelujah he used blood grammar god used bad grammar do you know something if god doesn't use you as you are you've seen irish coming in here today amen i'm not brother deal brother dale's brother deal hallelujah he's got a different way he'll lay it out far better than i can but you see god uses the personality he doesn't squeeze my personality to make me into brother samuel our brother weird you know god uses this like that and here he was still speaking through the voice of his prophet using his bad grammar he was good we know god's got good grammar but my my my high kid critics the spiritual mind will catch it that's all there is to it you know and just let me get right down here this is it amen the horse and buggy day then the automobile day then the european day came along and uh went from the earth into the air now if you'll watch assures that achievement was by science if the person will have a spiritual mind and understand it represented an achievement in god's economy with his church there you are spiritual typing the physical once you get into there you know i was preaching a message not long ago and you know that's the hard part folks you know when they were starting to break the sound barrier like them guys were brave and there he would get in the test pilot and he would be going up there and i don't know what mac was 600 miles an hour 700 or whatever it is but you know getting up the back the whole thing was shaking you know his whole life could bang you know i know he's going through it he's going through it you know how has it earth control you know pilot yes yes it's vibrating very bad but i'm holding on here and then all of a sudden whoosh he's broke through the sound barrier and there he's gliding oh my you see a big eagle you're on the ground you can flap your wings just one flap get up two flaps and then all of a sudden you're into the current the rest the rest hallelujah as you're gliding hey man and that's where you want to stay eagle only flies ten percent of the time ninety percent it's on them currency them if it wants to go up if it wants to go down and it's wonderful hallelujah and we're broken and that's where we want to be today hallelujah my last closing thoughts to you today that's where we want to be beyond all this shake and all i don't know about this or i don't know about that you know get right into that calm hallelujah well you know god's god hallelujah you know that you can trust that tomorrow morning to this day anytime amen wonderful and he said it represented an achievement we have stabbed up from the horse and boogie right into the species hallelujah the rapture is on amen every sign right here is before us there are no more signs you know i i never mentioned this but some people here in this united states believe brother branham's coming back well um i think i'm whatever i'm on and on this year i don't mind because i'll stand by what i say but i was reading this companion book and brother branham talked about you know uh the the brother that had that that kind of dream or vision whatever it was a dream of me being an indian you know and that said oh yeah you were the chief i'll ride this trail once more hallelujah and i'm reading that there and the angel says go back to arizona there you are not some return ministry hallelujah across the united states with a big tent who's going to tote the tent amen hallelujah all these uh physically resurrected people amen folks i'll tell you what i don't know what it is but it's not that amen and you know something yeah and he went back to arizona and fulfilled that that dream that the person had amen brought it to us amen the spiritual mind will catch it hallelujah let the world this is the very last four lanes or five lanes god bless you let the world say what it wants to and do what it wants blessed be in the name of the lord jesus is coming i don't care hallelujah they ain't going to announce them sister peggy they ain't going to announce it on tv so you don't need to worry you don't have a tv you'll miss the announcement hallelujah because they ain't going to announce it on the tv amen you know here is the news now yeah build soccer teams well jesus is coming at six o'clock in the morning oh hallelujah all america knows now no i'll tell you what but just like in matthew 25 amen hallelujah the midnight call there be a sign amen it could come from this very bride because i believe the voice of god is in the bride amen oh i believe that with all my heart amen and i'll tell you what that voice could go out hallelujah and call the dead i don't know but i'll tell you what i know the voice of god's here and so praise the lord and we'll hear that call amen and i'll tell you what we've rose up to meet the bridegroom we've done that but we'll go in together enter the wedding supper hallelujah amen listen you may call me a fanatic you might call me a holy rose i'm glad i'm not the only one amen i'm glad there's a whole lot of holy rollers with me a whole lot of fanatics if you want amen but i'll tell you what you can do that but someday he's coming and those that are in christ will god bring with him when he comes it's all spiritually revealed truth laying right there but it takes the spiritual mind to catch it so there you are young people if you think you figured it out or you haven't figured it out you won't figure it out it takes a spiritual mind for you to say god i don't know what it means will you reveal it to me and see what happens amen humble yourself and he says rest on that rest on it there is a rest there is a place of perfect rest behind the envelope rest on it he don't need if we've gone home or he didn't say that preacher said this that i don't even know where i am and i don't know you don't even need to worry about what the preacher said just you rest on what god showed you amen but brother i i don't know as much as you you don't have to know as much as me i don't know a lot and i don't know everything but i'll tell you what just what god's revealed to you you can rest on that and that will be enough amen that will be enough folks i tell you what we're going to shake hands and sit down one day at the marriage supper of the lamb yes we are praise the lord and that's it rest on that that's my final thought right today through the day think of it when you're at your dinner tonight brother ranu says think about it amen inspiration praise the lord god and his word inspirated amen god bless you today and if we could just perhaps stand and i want to pray for you amen at the end and again you know i tell you what we're all human beings and i i just want to say to you today that

bondage the liberty of the lord jesus christ is here and you do whatever you want amen if you think you can be helped in prayer you feel free to do it we'll stand with you amen but may the lord have as well and may the lord bless you and i'll tell you what as i said to the lady yesterday psalm 66 9. but i said to the little yesterday leaving the motel if god is kind to us i'll see you again amen

that lord lord what do you want me to do i've got this need what should i do and lord you'll direct us you'll show us you'll bless us because we are the apple of your eye so lord we do pray a blessing on brother samuel lord jesus i tell you such wonderful news that he's in good health and lord that's what we read in the third letter of john that's your desire blessed brother we're the same way lord as he travels nigh and back and forward and dear god we know there's an open door anytime he wants to come across to visit us so lord jesus i do pray your blessing on all the sins today everyone may your name that's all we want today lord we're not here to glorify flesh we're not here lord amen to to make ourselves anything that we ain't but lord we want to glorify you your glory shall you not serve and give to another lord and lord jesus when we saw that as we talked this this afternoon at the table lord that cloud that came down and you said to peter this is my beloved son hear ye him lord we're not here to hear man's opinions but we're always here to hear the word of god amen and so lord we pray your blessing on every home every last one that's here today that you will bless and

whatever you wish hey man give our brother a good name [Applause] you're under inspiration and things a whole lot different amen sorry sorry i'm going to talk to you with that you know people misunderstand inspiration you know during the time brother branham was coming up and heading toward his time to get into his ministry you know who was coming up to adolf hitler adolf hitler had a desire in his heart for a super race of people a blind race could it be that he picked up that anointing because that's what the prophet come to bring a message about a super race a super people hitler just took it the wrong way and perverted it inspiration but what are we going to do with it what are we going to do with what we got brother we're going to do [Music] 307 in the red book anybody have a need y'all just opened [Music] wow [Music] anybody else [Music] that's your desire then he'll hear [Music] wow [Music] anybody else [Music] [Applause] [Music] do it [Applause] [Music] hear my [Music] anybody else should have a knee just come let that inspiration strike your heart at what you have need of healing deliverance spiritual needs financial needs whatever it means let that inspiration strive for saying god is a provider of all things [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] what about it what about some of your [Music] have you children the inspiration that you need to be saved if you got that inspiration do you need to get baptized follow the lord and walk on come me [Music] else [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Applause] [Music] [Music] wow me [Music] wow [Music] amen and amen following others just don't pass me by make sure you stop my lord because that's what we needed we need inspiration because with inspiration it'll work ministers understand that maybe more than this laity because you know you have to speak and you want an inspiration and it's not we think it's a great big anointing that drops down that you know it's around you no it's just a thought that comes in your mind [Music] an inspiration can just be one word to a preacher that's all it takes all i need is that one word and i can't preach for weeks off of it because it's inspiration i love the presence of the lord and the feeling and the shout and all of that that's part of it but that's not the anointing that's supreme power in control amen but inspiration revelation is a better way of saying it but we need the prophet said it's revelation more than anything else we need a revelation so pray for revelation for god to speak to your heart and then you'll see a lot of things amen let's sing one more before we go brother like this [Music] life [Music] i love you [Music] [Applause] [Music] i lift up my hands [Music] [Music] [Music] so much life [Music] [Music] i love you oh [Music] [Music] amen and amen today man just make sure you tell brother gwen how much you appreciate him coming we truly do and coming to being with us and everything fellowshipping with us you know the weekend and praise the lord bless him as he travels on going on in into the land there and as we always try to do is it all right with everybody that we give him like check maybe for two thousand dollars to to put into the uh work of the lord diet or whatever he uses it we quit trying to build churches years ago but we have through him been able to do a little bit sometimes but we leave that up to him we use it for you know whatever means and things like that and i'm going to the lord willing or we are going to increase our giving to the brothers in the philippines so we will double that up we were giving them 200 a month for the trips and things they were making and uh all right we'll give them 400 a month and then that way we can can help them to travel and they really appreciate it you know because that takes care of a lot of their troubles that way they can go on their own and know that somebody's helping them you know to be able to travel and do those things okay amen just tell brother quinn how much you appreciated how much you love him and pray that the lord will bless him on his travels right father we thank you we love you we come
