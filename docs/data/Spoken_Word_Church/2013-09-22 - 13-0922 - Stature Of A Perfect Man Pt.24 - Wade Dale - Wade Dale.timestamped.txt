[0:01] amen
[0:03] here we go
[0:05] now this would be
[0:08] the
[0:09] last part we do on virtue let's look at
[0:12] virtue as a definition it is Conformity
[0:15] to a standard of right morality a
[0:18] particular moral Excellence an order of
[0:21] angels a beneficial quality or power of
[0:23] a thing
[0:31] and this thing slows today
[0:37] would be
[0:41] hello
[0:42] manly strength or courage a commendable
[0:45] quality of trade capacity to act and
[0:46] change to see especially in a woman now
[0:49] this virtue in the Statue of a perfect
[0:50] man we said last week was not virtue as
[0:54] in being a virgin all right it is in a
[1:01] you hot
[1:03] okay well the air conditioner is on so
[1:05] it's very hot okay
[1:09] that one's own right is it higher I just
[1:12] turned it on okay yeah you need to leave
[1:14] them Uncle then get stuffy in this room
[1:16] there's only one event there's only one
[1:18] been in and no return vents so what
[1:21] comes in here stays in here
[1:24] and with all this hot air going on in
[1:26] here
[1:30] anyway Hallelujah virgin it's not a
[1:34] virgin as in virginity it is virtue or
[1:37] what the prophet say it was strength the
[1:39] woman touched the hymn of the Garment
[1:41] Jesus had virtue and that's what we're
[1:43] looking at each one of us is
[1:46] in virtue now remember the woman touched
[1:49] His Garment
[1:50] and got the blessing that she asked for
[1:52] he felt virtue go out
[1:54] but when the men that knowed he was a
[1:56] prophet as a woman at the well put a rag
[1:58] around his head and hit him in the head
[1:59] said now if you're a prophet tell us who
[2:01] hit you they didn't feel no virtue did
[2:04] they it was the way you approach it
[2:07] the same way with the way we approach
[2:08] today
[2:10] in listening to the preachers
[2:13] today we're going to draw virtue off of
[2:17] it or right we're going to sit and and
[2:20] figure out in our brain how to build a
[2:22] house or what you know your mind can be
[2:24] way over under and you draw nothing from
[2:26] it but if you're coming
[2:27] expecting that there is virtue there
[2:31] see that's what you got to do you have
[2:33] confidence we have confidence that we're
[2:35] going to hear from God today okay now so
[2:40] that's what strength and that's what we
[2:42] need for our daily Journey because we
[2:45] are still humans
[2:47] we have human thoughts and ideas and and
[2:50] we're not born again in our spirit and
[2:53] our spirit Realms where we have our
[2:54] trouble
[2:55] there can be things that are unclean in
[2:58] that Realm
[3:00] unclean thoughts something against the
[3:03] brother harsh words
[3:05] hey we go on and on but we got to break
[3:08] through all that and see that the virtue
[3:11] comes from God
[3:12] which is pure and holy and nothing's
[3:15] wrong with him and everything's right
[3:16] and and the word's correct and that's
[3:18] where we get our strength because
[3:21] virtue is something that that's pulled
[3:23] from every angle because you can go home
[3:26] and you can read your Bible and draw
[3:28] virtue or strength from from the not
[3:31] from the physical book
[3:34] but it's from you listening and what did
[3:36] you have faith you got remember add to
[3:39] what you believe
[3:42] if you don't believe that that that
[3:44] God's Gonna help you when you read
[3:46] scripture then you know what
[3:47] just like the men that hit Jesus he he
[3:49] was the well
[3:51] spring he was the whole virtue bottled
[3:55] up in real name and then people beat him
[3:57] and just started with a human being they
[3:59] never drew anything from him at all okay
[4:02] they never do any strength they never do
[4:04] anything like that from him and
[4:07] not drawing from him
[4:12] this thing is not working again
[4:22] okay so turn it off back on again
[4:25] because look Jesus saw the felt
[4:28] virtually go from because somebody
[4:29] wanted something there was a need in
[4:31] somebody's life same way with you and I
[4:33] there's virtue and strength in all
[4:36] Christianity
[4:37] I believe Christianity is virtue that's
[4:40] where you go I mean how you're going to
[4:41] get strength from from this over here or
[4:44] some worldly something over here sure
[4:46] you can draw natural human abilities
[4:49] but that's going to pass away but virtue
[4:54] the virtue of Jesus Christ is what we're
[4:56] looking for not the virtue of Wayne Dale
[4:58] or or Bob black it's not the virtue but
[5:01] it's you're realizing that there's
[5:04] something in there
[5:05] that you can draw from
[5:08] okay that's why the the one that the
[5:12] ones that beat Jesus did not believe so
[5:14] you go back to Faith they did not
[5:16] believe he was a messiah
[5:19] so they didn't get anything
[5:22] yet he was the epitome of that statue of
[5:26] a perfect man had all the virtues in his
[5:28] life had everything working but
[5:31] their unbelief stopped the whole thing
[5:34] now the woman at the well or the woman
[5:37] that had the blood issue now what did
[5:39] she she was looking for something she
[5:42] was looking for some strength she was
[5:43] looking for something that she needed
[5:45] and then here walked Jesus Buy
[5:48] and of course God works on both ends
[5:51] you know he he gave her a desire to know
[5:55] that hey if I could not just touch the
[5:58] man
[5:59] just touch what he wears
[6:02] that's why
[6:05] you look at Paul
[6:07] and I believe that's where Paul got
[6:10] in that's 19 where the people got where
[6:13] they put clothes that were on Paul right
[6:15] passed them out that's prayer Clause
[6:17] that's just like same thing with you and
[6:19] I there's nothing to that piece of paper
[6:21] that piece of paper could come from a
[6:23] garbage can which we know they don't we
[6:25] don't do that but if it cut me if we
[6:28] were out here somewhere working in a
[6:29] field and I had an old dirty rag or
[6:31] something in my hand
[6:33] our daddy had an old dirty rag in his
[6:36] hand working
[6:37] uh when when the
[6:40] when that three inch nail went through
[6:41] all these fingers right here and the
[6:43] thing was sticking in you know this far
[6:45] like my finger and sticking out about
[6:46] like that it went through that finger in
[6:48] this finger and part of the way into
[6:50] that one while I pulled that one out but
[6:51] I have these two here with that nail
[6:53] sticking through it
[6:54] well I just recently pulled the thing
[6:56] out
[6:57] and uh
[6:59] we were working sweaty sawdust and all
[7:02] kind of stuff and
[7:05] that's what you got to do I said well
[7:07] just pray for him so he took his glove
[7:09] off them laid his hands up well his
[7:11] hands were just as dirty as mine
[7:13] but I went over to Mama's house and got
[7:15] some Epsom salt put a little Epsom salt
[7:17] on it never went to the doctor never got
[7:21] a tighten the shot went right back to
[7:23] work that day now honest to goodness the
[7:25] next day it was very sore
[7:27] you drive a three inch nails through
[7:28] both two three fingers and but you
[7:31] remember I told you the uh
[7:34] you can see it right there and there's
[7:36] an X you know how when you nail
[7:38] something and pull the nail out there's
[7:39] kind of an X because the way the points
[7:41] go down well it's still right there on
[7:43] my finger everything
[7:46] that's where that nail went in that's
[7:48] why there's two bumps right there that's
[7:50] where that nail went in it went in right
[7:52] there come out right here and went in
[7:54] that finger
[7:56] got a nail gun I was shooting the nail
[7:57] gun and I missed the board and I was
[7:59] holding the board I missed the board I
[8:02] missed the board and when I hit when I
[8:03] went down I pulled the trigger when I
[8:05] did it went
[8:07] well I went to the doctor about three
[8:08] months later and he said what happened
[8:10] to you because it was still a little bit
[8:11] swole he said what happened to your hand
[8:12] and I told him what happened he said he
[8:15] said well did you have it taken out by a
[8:16] surgeon I said well kinda
[8:22] the great physician was there
[8:25] but when I pulled it out honestly it it
[8:28] was that adrenaline shock at first you
[8:31] know it just shocked you and it doesn't
[8:32] really hurt that bad so the first thing
[8:34] I done real quick I grabbed the head of
[8:36] it and pulled it out so I had it I had
[8:37] it out
[8:39] but he looked at it and he said now what
[8:41] did you do and I told him I said there's
[8:42] a three inch nail now the nail was this
[8:44] big and it's about as big around as
[8:47] well it's almost as big around as this
[8:49] pencil right down here at the bottom
[8:51] about like that and it went through into
[8:54] here into here and in here like that and
[8:55] it was sticking out like that when I
[8:57] pulled it out
[8:58] but um
[9:00] he said well did you have somebody fix
[9:03] it and I said no he said did you have an
[9:04] x-ray I said no I said never even went
[9:06] to the doctor
[9:07] I said my dad prayed for it we believe
[9:08] in prayer went down pray for it
[9:11] he said well I surgically couldn't have
[9:13] put that
[9:15] surgically he said I couldn't have moved
[9:17] your you have a tendon going here and
[9:20] you have a tendon going here
[9:22] copying body if it breaks this tendon
[9:24] here your finger always falls down it
[9:26] never will come back up if a tendon's
[9:28] here your feet is going to be straight
[9:30] forever and you're never going to be
[9:31] able to do anything to keep your fingers
[9:32] straight and he said and there's little
[9:34] bitty bones in there
[9:36] and he said you didn't see any bones I
[9:38] said no no bone come out nothing I mean
[9:40] when I pulled it out went over to Mama's
[9:42] and put the Epsom salt on it I didn't do
[9:44] no more and peroxide put a little
[9:46] peroxide on it but I never never stopped
[9:50] but I believed there was some virtue
[9:52] standing there this is my point I
[9:54] believe there was some virtue standing
[9:55] there that I didn't have to run to the
[9:57] doctor again right
[9:59] because when he prayed for it I said
[10:01] well that's it he said what are you
[10:02] going to do I said let's go back to work
[10:03] and he said you need to go over there to
[10:04] the house and put some Epsom salt or
[10:07] something or get Nanny to find something
[10:09] to put on it so anyway the doctor said I
[10:13] couldn't have surgically placed that
[10:15] nail in your finger
[10:18] and not hit this tendon or this tendon
[10:21] or a bone he said there's not but just a
[10:25] little just a micrometer amount of room
[10:28] between this tendon that tendon and
[10:31] there's a bone that runs through there
[10:33] too
[10:33] he said that nail must have went right
[10:36] over between and it didn't go through
[10:38] them or I would not have had any use of
[10:40] this thing
[10:41] I said well I said thank God that in my
[10:44] stupidity
[10:46] he put the nail through there the right
[10:48] way you know he put the nail through
[10:50] there the right way my guardian angel
[10:52] was sitting there you know diagnosing it
[10:54] and then when it happened
[10:56] it was done so you see there there's no
[10:59] amen I was careful from then on that's
[11:02] not like we were reading it's not let's
[11:04] not be stupid
[11:05] amen so well if God healed out I think
[11:08] I'll just you know
[11:11] that's stupidity and that being
[11:16] well
[11:19] let's not tempt God right right that's
[11:22] tempting god let's don't say God well
[11:24] you took me out of this I'm gonna do it
[11:26] again and see you taking no he may be
[11:29] far away from there
[11:30] because you know what it's the approach
[11:32] because God is where the virtue comes
[11:35] from
[11:36] and what if God and we're going to see
[11:38] it this afternoon what if God has
[11:40] condescended down and wants you to be
[11:43] God
[11:45] if we're the last and morphy of God
[11:48] then where do we draw strength from
[11:51] we draw strength from God sure through
[11:53] prayer but I believe the Bible says that
[11:55] there's five
[11:56] full ministry that's going to perfect
[11:58] the Saints so to get your Perfection
[11:59] you're going to have to listen to a
[12:01] preacher that's right I have to listen
[12:03] to a preacher that's the problem
[12:04] preachers don't think they listen have
[12:06] to listen to preachers
[12:08] no and I've heard some of them and they
[12:11] definitely need to be listening to
[12:12] preacher all right but the way they they
[12:15] just get up and start preaching they
[12:17] open their mouth and nothing comes out
[12:20] there's no virtue but see we draw virtue
[12:23] and strength from
[12:25] the things that we what believe in
[12:29] so see you drop off everything we're
[12:31] going to look at
[12:32] and I really didn't realize this until
[12:34] until just a few months ago when we
[12:36] first got started with this everything
[12:38] that's why my brother Brown said all
[12:41] this is based on faith well I knew the
[12:43] quote well you've got to take virtue and
[12:45] you don't do away with faith you've got
[12:46] to come right back to that Faith have
[12:49] faith in virtue
[12:51] you got to come up to knowledge you got
[12:53] to drop right back to Faith and have
[12:55] faith that's why I said let's put it
[12:56] this way after what you believe virtue
[12:59] then add to what you believe knowledge
[13:02] then add to what you believe temperament
[13:04] because you got to believe that you can
[13:06] have temperature if you don't believe
[13:07] you have temperatures you can't have it
[13:09] right you got to believe and you got to
[13:11] believe there's a place you can go to
[13:13] get it that's right see that's important
[13:15] but see there's a way been made
[13:17] for us to get it there's a there's an
[13:19] Avenue through the prophet's message and
[13:21] now through the fivefold ministry where
[13:24] you can draw virtue and strength
[13:26] from
[13:28] a five-fold Ministry
[13:30] are from listening to tapes and and you
[13:32] know things like that you can do that
[13:35] and and draw a string from but
[13:38] to get perfected that says statue of a
[13:40] perfect man you got to always come back
[13:43] to a five-fold ministry that's why we
[13:44] believe in a faithful Ministry we don't
[13:47] believe in a onefold we believe in a
[13:48] five-fold Ministry there's five
[13:50] different avenues that God brings you
[13:52] virtue and strength from
[13:57] all right
[13:59] let's go to the next one
[14:03] so here's the
[14:06] Greek Lexicon definition which is coming
[14:10] straight from Peter there in the Bible
[14:11] which is dunamis
[14:14] dunamis which is what power Mighty work
[14:18] strength
[14:22] miracles
[14:26] strength power and ability now number
[14:28] one a inherent power
[14:34] see that inherent power power
[14:37] residing In A Thing by virtue of its
[14:40] nature that's how you can draw strength
[14:43] from it that's brother Dale if you saw
[14:45] him last week in a bar and you saw him
[14:47] with another woman and now and him come
[14:49] and preach the gospel
[14:53] that's another nature
[14:56] then what you're expecting of a virtuous
[14:59] person so can you draw strength on that
[15:02] no
[15:03] same thing with us that's why a life
[15:05] lived all right come on now brother
[15:08] Brown said a life lived is where we're
[15:10] missing it
[15:11] the life live brings these I believe a
[15:14] life live brings these things
[15:16] automatically right they have to come to
[15:19] that life all right so now look
[15:23] or which a person or thing exerts and
[15:27] puts forth right
[15:30] power for performing Miracles or moral
[15:32] power and Excellence of soul
[15:35] moral power and Excellence of soul
[15:38] all right
[15:42] see there's even a man man's ability the
[15:45] power and influence which belongs to
[15:47] riches and wealth
[15:48] you can draw virtue from that people
[15:50] like Dave Ramsey and people like that
[15:52] you can draw virtue because they're
[15:53] wealthy I mean you really it's like Dad
[15:55] said you really don't want to read a
[15:56] book about how to raise kids from a
[15:59] single parent and he was an only child
[16:03] it just gets worse and worse you know I
[16:07] mean and how can you draw how can you
[16:09] pick that book up and say man I'm going
[16:11] to really get something out of this well
[16:13] you might but it might not be what you
[16:14] want what you think you're gonna get
[16:16] but what about somebody that's got four
[16:18] or five kids and been married 30
[16:19] something years I had a friend of mine
[16:21] the other day
[16:22] um
[16:23] plays a friend of Zacks actually a young
[16:25] boy named Chris
[16:26] Porter
[16:27] well he took over a church over in Banks
[16:31] County called Rock Spring Jacob and I
[16:33] were talking about it the other day and
[16:34] we made him on the road over there he
[16:36] was running so we kind of got in a
[16:37] conversation about it not to him but um
[16:41] he's 23. that close to exact same age
[16:44] 23.
[16:45] and he's pastoring a church this is
[16:47] people been married longer and he's been
[16:49] born
[16:50] now not saying anything against the bull
[16:53] I think he does he'll do a good job if
[16:55] he'll what he needs to do is get a bunch
[16:57] of them older guys and get them close to
[16:58] him
[16:59] he didn't see so he's going to draw
[17:01] virtue
[17:03] if he will he's going to draw virtue off
[17:05] them older people but how in the world
[17:06] can he just like Jacob said how in the
[17:08] world is he going to sit down with
[17:08] somebody I've been married 35 years and
[17:10] go we're having a problem with our
[17:11] marriage
[17:12] and he's been married what six months or
[17:14] something you know I think he just got
[17:15] married so there's really you can't draw
[17:17] I would have a problem with drawing some
[17:19] virtues on that but now somebody had
[17:21] been married 40 years or 30 years and
[17:22] you've been married 30 years I can sit
[17:25] down and relate and you can have a
[17:27] there's a drawing power there okay but
[17:29] God will give you Godly virtue
[17:31] to be able to help I'm not saying that
[17:33] young people can't help older people but
[17:35] I think the Bible never says that the
[17:37] Bible says the older will teach the
[17:39] younger okay I never saw it in there
[17:42] where it said the younger will teach you
[17:43] older all right now some young person
[17:45] with a holy ghost though can help you
[17:48] okay so let's don't get all that all
[17:50] messed up that we don't have you know
[17:52] I'm I'm 53 years old and anything below
[17:54] me I'm not listening to you
[17:56] hey as you get older there's a lot of
[17:59] people back on that side that they are
[18:02] on that side
[18:03] like a man said the other day it was 80
[18:06] something years old he said I don't have
[18:07] many friends anymore
[18:10] he said they're dying
[18:14] okay
[18:16] so we can have the power and influence
[18:19] which belongs to rich as well power and
[18:21] resources arising from numbers
[18:23] power consisting and are resting upon
[18:26] Army's forces and hosts now that's man's
[18:28] ability
[18:29] of strength
[18:31] but now watch Luke 6 19 up there was a
[18:35] whole bunch of people touched him one
[18:36] day
[18:37] where there went virtue out of him and
[18:39] healed them all so they all were looking
[18:40] for something they all were able to
[18:42] touch
[18:43] Jesus
[18:45] and get what they expected
[18:47] not just one person
[18:49] and then we see where Jesus said who
[18:52] touched me when all denied Peter said
[18:53] they were winning Master the multitude
[18:55] throwing the impressed then saith who
[18:57] touched me
[18:58] because see Peter saw that there was
[19:00] hundreds of people around him probably
[19:01] touching him and pushing him and and you
[19:03] know all kind of stuff but that woman
[19:05] just crawled up underneath there and
[19:06] just reached and touched the Hem of His
[19:08] Garment
[19:09] Jesus said somebody hath touched me now
[19:14] he was not talking in the human sense
[19:16] then right
[19:18] okay that wasn't the human man Jesus
[19:21] talking you understand sure it was a
[19:23] human man Jesus but Jesus that's why
[19:24] they couldn't understand they're like
[19:26] well Peter said well
[19:28] man everybody's touching you they're
[19:30] pressing you so hard I can't hardly keep
[19:32] them off of you and you said who touched
[19:34] me
[19:35] yeah there's a hundred people texting
[19:38] and you said someone somebody have
[19:41] touched me
[19:42] for I perceive that virtue has gone out
[19:44] of me and then what what did he do the
[19:46] Bible says he turns
[19:48] and he called her spirit he contacted
[19:50] her spirit and then what did he do he
[19:53] said woman
[19:54] forever them 20 something years or
[19:56] whatever it was 30 years that you've had
[19:57] that problem healing
[20:00] healed instantly because she had went
[20:07] to the Fountain of all virtue I think we
[20:09] read this one the other day
[20:12] but let's look at number 29 now I
[20:14] believe the virtue is in Christ and
[20:15] Christ is the word
[20:17] all right the virtues in Christ
[20:19] but but it's Christ in you the hope of
[20:21] glory though if it's Christ in you
[20:24] we're going to see something this
[20:25] afternoon we're gonna we're gonna visit
[20:28] an old
[20:30] an old scripture that
[20:33] I enjoy preaching on Genesis 1 26 and
[20:37] 27.
[20:38] we're going to see a little something
[20:40] maybe the Lord showed me on my lawnmower
[20:42] the other day
[20:47] it's already interact
[20:50] I had to get another one
[20:52] if he listen is intent if y'all will
[20:54] listen to his intentions he did you'll
[20:55] get something out of it
[20:57] I guess it's a hate
[20:59] but in the beginning was the word the
[21:01] word was with God and the Word was God
[21:03] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[21:05] Among Us we're going to read that
[21:07] scripture today but I want you to see
[21:08] something that that I believe we're
[21:10] missing
[21:11] in that Genesis 1 26 and 27 man now the
[21:15] word itself comes back in the form of
[21:16] the Holy Spirit into us and it's word in
[21:20] you
[21:21] right so if you draw strengths on the
[21:24] word and the words in you then that's
[21:27] what we're talking about we're drawing
[21:28] strength from the word that's in you all
[21:31] right
[21:33] um so many wants to point God to some
[21:36] mystical something way away
[21:39] are so far away they overreach it God is
[21:43] in you the hope of glory Christ the mind
[21:46] that was in Christ in you you're
[21:48] reaching Plum away from it trying to get
[21:50] what's been given to you God in the
[21:54] human being
[21:55] pretty good
[21:56] all right statue of perfect bad man the
[21:58] Bible says we read over here in the Book
[22:00] of Luke where it says virtue went out of
[22:02] him that's right turn against to the men
[22:04] we're going to be like him
[22:05] we must have virtue
[22:08] then we must have it to be like him is
[22:10] the first song that I ever loved
[22:13] was to be like Jesus I've got to have
[22:16] virgin and a past that can pass forward
[22:19] from me to the people
[22:21] if you got virtue and you keep it what
[22:24] good is it
[22:26] Jesus said I give my life
[22:30] I lay down my life for what you
[22:33] so you can draw virtue off of it so he
[22:35] can come back
[22:39] to the people because virtue went out of
[22:40] him to the people virtue and before you
[22:42] can let it out you got to have it first
[22:45] you haven't got it it won't come out
[22:47] there's nothing for it to come out up
[22:49] what if someone tried to draw virtue out
[22:51] of us and the check would return
[22:52] insufficient funds see no no none there
[22:55] to draw from check them out somebody
[22:57] looked at you as a Christian and
[22:59] Demarest you aren't here at home like a
[23:01] center not much pressure can be drawn
[23:03] from that all right let's read this
[23:05] right here virtue must be in us and
[23:08] until we get virtue
[23:10] now look
[23:11] when then when we get true virtue
[23:14] we can add it to our faith face the
[23:18] foundation can add it to our faith
[23:19] that's the next foundation wall now
[23:22] first you must have faith faith alone
[23:23] won't do it
[23:25] how you like that you ever read that
[23:27] before faith alone won't do it
[23:32] you got to have these ads all right
[23:33] faith alone won't do it you've got Peter
[23:37] said then add virgin to your faith you
[23:38] must have virtue in order to add it to
[23:42] your faith now then it might be the
[23:43] reason you don't have it
[23:45] because many churches of the day teach
[23:47] you don't have to have it
[23:50] same way in the message I always was
[23:52] eternal I don't and I got I was born
[23:54] with eternal life and all this all this
[23:56] stuff huh I I don't I don't see that
[24:00] I see that we have to grow in Grace and
[24:02] knowledge we have to receive the new
[24:03] birth we have to be born again all right
[24:08] because many churches of today teach you
[24:10] don't have to have it or the days of it
[24:12] has passed
[24:13] they don't have to have it the only
[24:15] thing you have to do is just join the
[24:16] church or believe the message
[24:20] can I say that
[24:21] same thing that's what he's saying right
[24:23] here all you have to do is just come to
[24:24] a message church and and and and and and
[24:26] just start believing and and then that's
[24:29] all
[24:31] no I'm gonna read your quote today from
[24:34] the future home
[24:35] that brother Brown said I've taught
[24:37] three works of Grace from the beginning
[24:39] and I thank God I'm still teaching it
[24:41] now so I don't see where a lot of people
[24:43] a lot of preachers have told me that
[24:44] brother Brown after the seals bro
[24:46] changed the way he preached the new
[24:48] birth I that to me that's a lie
[24:51] to me that's a lie that's the lie
[24:54] because it's not true but they're taking
[24:56] the quotes it's like I told Jim the
[24:59] other day they've got the cow
[25:01] they've got the grass and they've got
[25:03] the tree so they've got the quotes
[25:06] in the Bible they got the picture but
[25:10] they've got the cow eating grass in the
[25:12] top of the tree they don't have their
[25:13] picture put right
[25:15] but thank God we've got a
[25:17] a
[25:19] teacher up there and he's going to be
[25:22] preaching some on it today too
[25:24] that can put the thing together and and
[25:27] let me say this
[25:29] they have to there's many doctrines
[25:33] so I want you to be able to draw virtue
[25:34] off of what you hear there's many
[25:35] doctrines see the Parisian Doctrine the
[25:38] two Soul dogs and every Doctrine in the
[25:40] message has quote
[25:43] so it was bred around that confused did
[25:45] he have that many doctrines in this one
[25:48] message that we hold so dear
[25:51] he can't right
[25:53] but but dad's the old brother that was
[25:56] the only preacher I've ever seen that
[25:58] takes every quote that even seems
[26:01] contrary and lays them out there and
[26:03] puts them together unless the Holy Ghost
[26:05] put them together for you not man
[26:07] because I've heard these people preach
[26:09] just over here well they've got their 25
[26:10] quotes that they drill on over here but
[26:13] what about this one over here right
[26:16] I always was eternal I have eternal life
[26:19] I was born in the world a baby with
[26:21] eternal life Lord have you heard it on
[26:23] the
[26:25] internet
[26:26] then brother random over here on
[26:28] adoption he says your eternal life
[26:30] begins at the offer right and how
[26:32] confused is that
[26:35] they said oh he always was a grain of
[26:38] wheat or always was an eagle
[26:40] brother Brown and I got 15 quotes for
[26:42] brother Brown said I was a cup of her
[26:45] but when the life of the wheat came in
[26:48] I became a win the life of the week came
[26:51] in right I became a week now see there's
[26:54] a change there now he's not that
[26:56] confused
[26:58] we are right
[27:02] because if you deny one quote
[27:04] then you've got brother Brown you're
[27:06] saying he was wrong here but he was
[27:08] right here same way with the Daniel 70
[27:11] wins there's many quotes it sounds like
[27:13] it's contrary but they're not once you
[27:15] put them all together it's a beautiful
[27:16] picture and thank God that we can draw
[27:19] virtue from that virtue anyone knows
[27:21] what the word virtue means see we must
[27:22] have it if virtue went from him to heal
[27:24] the woman that was sick he's expecting
[27:26] the same virtue in his church because he
[27:29] was our example
[27:31] and if he had virtue to give to the
[27:33] people he expects us to have virtue to
[27:35] give to the people and what is virtue
[27:37] virtuous strength
[27:39] all right dunamis power
[27:43] so does anybody got any questions or
[27:45] anything on virtue there's The Virtue
[27:47] that's the that's the
[27:50] um life inside working its way out
[27:52] that's the same thing but faith alone
[27:53] can't do it
[27:55] now wrote around and said faith alone
[27:56] faith will get you in a rapture
[28:00] faith will put you in the body of Christ
[28:03] all right but faith will not make you a
[28:06] perfect man a complete man
[28:09] in the economy of God sure your son of
[28:13] God sure you're just as Eternal as God
[28:14] is but God doesn't want just that
[28:17] he don't want you just to have faith he
[28:19] wants to have faith in himself
[28:21] but at least it's then you gotta have
[28:22] faith in yourself first this is where
[28:24] the virtue comes from and you guys say
[28:27] hey I gotta have this but I don't walk
[28:30] around saying now Trudy's got to have it
[28:32] since crudy's got to have it now she
[28:34] just got to have virgin well that'll do
[28:36] you very good that ain't got a lot of
[28:37] virgins I ain't got a lot of uh
[28:39] knowledge
[28:41] bring a lot of knowledge all these
[28:43] things tie together so next week we're
[28:45] gonna I want you to look up the word
[28:47] knowledge in the dictionary and look up
[28:50] the word knowledge in the Bible because
[28:52] you're going to get a bond subscription
[28:54] but look up both of them and bring them
[28:56] with you when I quote them you'll know
[28:57] who they are all right let's go
[29:02] foreign
