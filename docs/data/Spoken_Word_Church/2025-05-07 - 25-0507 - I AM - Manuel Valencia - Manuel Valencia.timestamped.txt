[0:06] God never true. It's changing me. It's
[0:12] changing
[0:13] you. We have come with open hearts. Oh,

[0:25] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[0:28] Well, I'm happy to be here. I'm thankful
[0:30] and praise the Lord for Amen. for all
[0:32] he's done in our lives for this ministry
[0:34] for the opportunity to stand behind this
[0:36] sacred desk. Praise the Lord. It is um
[0:39] God bless you all that has been behind
[0:41] this ministry and supporting and have
[0:44] been a part of it. We've uh had a well a
[0:47] very um grateful welcome. So, we are so
[0:51] grateful for that. We thank the Lord and
[0:52] thank each and every one of you. And
[0:54] thank you, Pastor Dale. Well, as we all
[0:57] get situated here, we'll we'll get right
[0:59] into the word and we'll pray. I have a a
[1:02] thought that burns in my heart, so I
[1:04] look forward to sharing with you. It's a
[1:06] lot of scriptures and and as I was in my
[1:09] study, there was uh just a lot of fresh
[1:12] revelation just being poured down and
[1:14] we're so grateful to to be able to share
[1:17] this. Okay. Praise the Lord. Yeah, it'
[1:20] be
[1:20] perfect. That's good right
[1:23] there. Very good. Well, let's bow our
[1:25] heads as we're all standing already.
[1:27] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful.
[1:29] We're so thankful, Lord, that you given
[1:32] us life, that you're giving us these
[1:33] words of hope, these these words of
[1:36] life, that they let give us strength and
[1:37] help us cope. We ask that you bless this
[1:40] service tonight, that you will give us
[1:42] uh a strong anointing, Father, just to
[1:44] receive your word and uh that you would
[1:46] just have these words cause the effect
[1:49] that you intended for them, that they
[1:50] would not return to you void. Amen. I
[1:52] pray, Father, that it would be preached
[1:54] in simplicity. That the thoughts that
[1:56] you had before the foundation of the
[1:57] world would be fresh and revealed to us
[2:00] in a in a brand new way, Father, just
[2:02] like something brand new, something that
[2:04] rejoices, something that has life with
[2:06] it. So, we pray that in the mighty name
[2:08] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may take your
[2:10] seats.
[2:21] We'll start off with uh three opening
[2:23] scriptures. We'll go to Exodus 6.
[2:28] And the title of the sermon, it would be
[2:29] uh I am. Amen. Good. So just two two
[2:32] simple letter words. Amen. I am. And
[2:35] then I have a subtitle there. And it's
[2:39] stated, but he said I am. Amen. Amen.
[2:43] And then these are all scriptural
[2:46] verses. I even have a subtitle to the
[2:47] subtitle if I may. And that is when the
[2:51] I am speaks all else remains silent.
[2:56] And we'll see examples of that of
[2:58] Jehovah the Old Testament. We'll see
[3:00] examples of that of Jesus of the New.
[3:02] We'll see examples of that in brother
[3:04] Brandham's life and in characters of the
[3:07] Bible and in also if the Lord will us to
[3:10] share testimonies of in our our own
[3:12] lives. So, we're grateful to share this.
[3:14] All right. So, in ex Exodus 3:14, when
[3:17] you think of the I am, the first thing
[3:18] that comes to mind, right, is I am that
[3:21] I am. Amen. Right? That's just the first
[3:22] thing that comes to mind. So, let's go
[3:24] ahead and read uh that. It would be
[3:27] 34. And it
[3:29] says, excuse me,
[3:31] Exodus, Exodus
[3:34] 3:14, I'll read from here. And God said
[3:36] unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said,
[3:39] "Thus shalt thou say to the children of
[3:42] Israel, I am has sent you." I've always
[3:45] asked myself, what was it about that?
[3:47] Oh, okay. So, if he said it, then okay,
[3:49] now now we get it. What was that? What
[3:51] was it? What was it behind that name? It
[3:54] got me to think. It's like, was this the
[3:56] first time that the word I am was used
[3:58] or what what was it about it? And we'll
[4:00] go into that. Amen. Then we'll go into
[4:02] Mark 14:61-62.
[4:04] And um this is the high priest actually
[4:07] gonna pose a question. So he says, "But
[4:09] he held his peace Jesus and answered
[4:12] nothing." Yeah. Again, the high priest
[4:15] asked him and said unto him, "Art thou
[4:18] the Christ, the son of the blessed?"
[4:22] And Jesus said, "I am." Amen.
[4:26] Amen. And ye shall see the son of man
[4:28] sitting on the right hand of power.
[4:30] Amen. and coming in the heavens or in
[4:33] the clouds of heavens. Amen. Praise the
[4:35] Lord. And this is one of my favorite
[4:37] ones because this brings it down to me
[4:39] and you. Amen. This is referring to the
[4:43] blind man that was blind from his from
[4:46] birth, right? And some of his neighbors,
[4:48] it says on the verse before this, it
[4:52] says, "And some of the neighbors will
[4:53] talk among themselves. It says, is it
[4:55] him? Is it really him? You know, he
[4:57] looks like him." And again, these are
[5:00] the neighbors. They should have known
[5:01] him better, right? So then some said, it
[5:04] goes on nine, John 9:9, this is he.
[5:07] Others said he's like him. But what did
[5:10] he said? Amen. But he said, I am he.
[5:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So
[5:15] we'll take off from there because uh
[5:18] those are the opening scriptures. But I
[5:20] have about 25 different characters that
[5:21] have said those words, I am. Amen. And I
[5:24] know brother Dale has said it. I know
[5:25] some of us have said it. You know, I am
[5:27] is such a personal strong testimony.
[5:30] Amen. It is um you know, first
[5:33] eyewitness and such. It is uh pretty
[5:36] powerful in a court of rule, right? In a
[5:38] rule accord. But I I think uh just as
[5:41] powerful is when the person that was
[5:43] there feeling it, doing it, it says what
[5:46] he truly experienced. It's the I am.
[5:49] True, brother. Amen. Right. So, we'll go
[5:51] with that. And as I was asking to see if
[5:53] it was the first time that that word I
[5:54] am was used or not. Then I realized that
[5:56] no, we had to go back to when God spoke
[5:59] to Abraham, it was the first time that
[6:00] the word I am was actually ever spoken.
[6:02] And I found it in Genesis 15:1 where he
[6:05] says, "I am thy shield." Again, it was
[6:07] not Abraham yet. It was Abraham. And
[6:09] then we'll find it in Genesis 15:7 where
[6:11] he said, "I am the Lord that brought
[6:14] thee out of." So it's already with the
[6:16] with the proof. You know, remember I was
[6:18] the one that brought you out. that that
[6:19] came with a bit of a of a evidence now
[6:22] of of the Chaldas to give thee this land
[6:26] to inherit it. Then we'll go into a
[6:29] little bit later where it says, "And
[6:31] when Abraham was 90 years old and nine
[6:35] 99, the Lord appeared to Abraham and
[6:38] said unto him, I am the God. I am the
[6:40] almighty God." Amen. and and we'll see
[6:43] and we'll trace through the scriptures
[6:44] how this almighty God kept on being
[6:47] traced to the different ones. Amen. And
[6:49] I love it how we usually hear of the the
[6:52] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And
[6:54] there's a progression here because at
[6:56] first it was the God of Abraham only.
[6:57] And then you'll see how Isaac says, "I
[6:59] am the God of I am." He kept on
[7:01] revealing himself the God of Abra
[7:04] Abraham or Abraham. And then the same
[7:07] thing with Jacob. He says, "I am the God
[7:08] of Isa, the Abraham, the God of Isaac.
[7:11] Right? And then there was that
[7:12] progression, right? And then it went on
[7:14] to then it went on to Joseph uh the the
[7:18] fact that he revealed to him in dreams
[7:21] and then we have Moses. So though that
[7:24] was the progression there it it
[7:26] was so there was a story behind that
[7:29] already. So when they said I am that I
[7:31] am I am he has sent thee they uh they
[7:36] had the personal testimony already of
[7:38] what was what was it that their parents
[7:40] were talking about. Here's some some
[7:41] examples. I'll just scroll through some
[7:42] of these where seeing here he said, I
[7:45] the Lord appear unto him Isaac. The same
[7:47] night, I am the God of Abraham, thy
[7:50] father. Fear not, I am with thee. I will
[7:54] bless thee and multiply thy seed from my
[7:58] servant Abraham's sake. Amen. Then on
[8:00] 28, it goes on to say, now this is
[8:03] Jacob, right? Because he was talking
[8:04] about Jacob's ladder. So he goes to him,
[8:07] I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy
[8:11] father, and the God of
[8:13] Isaac, the land where thou liest to thee
[8:17] I will give it and to thy seed. I like
[8:20] how he threw that in there, right? And
[8:21] to thy seed. It's starting to involve us
[8:23] there a little bit. So praise the Lord.
[8:25] You know, this in blue here is not
[8:27] scripture. This is just me uh putting up
[8:30] a sentence in here. So God revealed to
[8:31] Abraham who the I am was. then Isaac,
[8:35] then Jacob, then to thy seed. So, we
[8:38] have a promise, right? Amen. Is the
[8:39] blessings were to Abraham and uh to the
[8:42] descendency and to thy seed. Genesis
[8:44] 35:11, he gave Israel the same promise
[8:47] and he said as he did Abraham and the
[8:50] same and the same in revelations of he
[8:53] said I am God Almighty. Now, that's
[8:56] Jesus speaking. So there's also a little
[8:58] bit of correlations here how the deity
[9:00] of Jesus Christ and Jehovah the old
[9:03] being being Jesus of the
[9:04] new. So then uh in here is when he spoke
[9:07] to Jacob in many different ways and he
[9:10] kept on saying the I am but I really
[9:13] would like to to ponder on this one a
[9:15] little bit. So in Genesis 37, Joseph
[9:19] dreamed a dream and then the father sent
[9:23] him to seek his brothers. A type right?
[9:25] We know brother Banner said he was a
[9:27] perfect type. Amen. Now he said the man
[9:28] was perfect. He said it was a perfect
[9:30] type. Right. So to see if they were
[9:32] keeping the sheep. His brothers were
[9:35] not. They had left to the thawn. His
[9:38] brothers conspired against him in
[9:41] Genesis 39. The Lord was with Joseph. So
[9:46] then we know what happened when he went
[9:49] on and to to become to come into his
[9:52] position. I love this verse because it
[9:54] says in Genesis
[9:57] 45:3, "And Joseph said unto his
[10:01] brethren," I am Joseph. So now think
[10:04] about how strong that is. Who can refute
[10:07] him? Who can tell him, "No, you're not."
[10:08] Who who can come against that I am in a
[10:11] in a person now? Yeah. In a human being,
[10:15] not I am Abraham. I am uh Jacob. I am
[10:18] Isaac. I am it. This might be the first
[10:22] time that a person was saying it in with
[10:26] this revelation. But look what happened.
[10:28] Does my father or does my father yet
[10:30] live? And his brethren could not answer
[10:33] him.
[10:35] So as we continue, we're going to read a
[10:37] lot of scriptures and and share a lot of
[10:39] testimonies from the message where I
[10:40] found people saying I am. Right. Brother
[10:43] Bandham saying I am. Yeah. Uh many of
[10:46] the characters in the message quotes
[10:48] saying I am. Right. And in the Bible
[10:50] saying, "I am." And just just do notice
[10:52] that how there's always a power that
[10:54] flew with it. There's always that went
[10:55] with it. There was always a a truth.
[10:58] There was always a righteousness. How
[11:00] you know, in Spanish, we have a saying
[11:01] when you play baseball and it says, you
[11:03] know, who's going to argue against the
[11:04] empire, right? Yeah. Right. You know,
[11:06] it's it's like said and done, right?
[11:07] It's like I think I am is a stronger
[11:10] statement that
[11:13] I'll read it again. And Joseph said,
[11:15] "This is Joseph clearly unto his
[11:16] brother, I am Joseph. Does my father yet
[11:19] live?" I just love that, you know, he's
[11:22] just already his heart's already earning
[11:23] you, and his brethren could not answer
[11:26] him, for they were troubled at his
[11:29] presence. Amen. Praise the Lord. I think
[11:31] that's just that I think that's
[11:32] beautiful, brothers. And you know, when
[11:33] somebody is truly testifying, I am. And
[11:37] I wrote that in there twice just in case
[11:39] I forgot it. So in Exodus 2, God spake
[11:42] unto Moses uh saying, "I am the Lord."
[11:45] The reason why I put these scriptures
[11:46] that are in Exodus 6 also where he said,
[11:48] "I am that I am is that even before God
[11:52] told Moses, now we're skipping to Moses
[11:55] now. Um uh I am that I am. Go tell him
[11:58] that I am sent." Yeah. Has sent thee. I
[12:02] love the fact that he also revealed
[12:03] himself to Moses. So in in 62 it says,
[12:05] "And God spake unto Moses and said unto
[12:07] him, I am the Lord." In six, he said,
[12:10] "Moreover, I said, I am the God of thy
[12:13] father, the God of Abraham, the God of
[12:16] Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Amen. And
[12:19] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[12:22] look upon God. But on seven, it says,
[12:25] "And I will take
[12:27] you to my people, and I will be with you
[12:30] a God." Yeah. and ye shall know that I
[12:34] am the Lord your God. I like that know,
[12:36] right? And that I am the Lord your God,
[12:39] which bringeth you out from the burdens
[12:42] of the Egyptians. Yeah. Right. And then
[12:44] I love how in
[12:47] 11 Moses asked a real good question. He
[12:49] says, "And Moses said unto God, who am
[12:51] I?" See, God just told him who God was.
[12:55] Right? So, I think this is where we
[12:57] start to discover, well, who am I? Amen.
[13:00] Right. Amen. I think it's a good
[13:02] question to ask even. Go ahead and ask
[13:04] it. Might as well. I mean, you want to
[13:06] know who you live with. You want to know
[13:07] who you who you are. Amen. Who are you?
[13:10] And look into that. As I'm reading some
[13:12] of the scriptures, sometimes there's a
[13:15] there's plenty of places where the I am
[13:17] came after somebody asked that question.
[13:20] Who are you, Jesus? Who who are you? Or
[13:22] or to the blind man, you know, and I am
[13:25] he. Argue against that. He can prove it.
[13:28] He can say, I can tell what you look
[13:29] like now. Right. Amen. I was blind, but
[13:31] now I can see. Right. Amen. Praise the
[13:33] Lord. So I I like that because then he
[13:35] says that I should go unto Pharaoh. Who
[13:36] am I? Right. That I should go unto
[13:37] Pharaoh that I should bring forth the
[13:40] children of Israel out of Egypt. Who are
[13:43] you? You know who are you to take God's
[13:45] possession out of Egypt, out of the
[13:48] world, out of denominationism and such.
[13:51] And then he said in 12, "Certainly I
[13:54] will be with thee." Amen. See, he didn't
[13:56] immediately tell him who he was. Again,
[13:57] he didn't answer that question quite
[13:58] yet. I think he does a little later here
[14:00] because it says, "I certainly I will be
[14:02] with thee and this shall be a token." I
[14:06] like how he gave him a token, right? He
[14:08] says, "Unto thee that I have sent thee."
[14:12] So, in other words, he's someone that
[14:13] God sent. So already he's telling to
[14:14] reveal to him who he is. When thou hast
[14:17] brought forth the people out of Egypt, I
[14:19] love how God prophesied, right? He says,
[14:20] "When you will, he will bring these
[14:22] people out of Egypt, you shall serve."
[14:23] So then here it is. He was God's
[14:25] servant. You shall serve. We have to
[14:28] find ourselves in the volumes of the
[14:29] book, right? So, he shall serve God upon
[14:31] this mountain. Praise the Lord. And
[14:33] that's a sermon in of itself. So, yeah.
[14:36] Uh I I promise not to take 10 hours, so
[14:38] I'll take the one. So,
[14:41] I'll make sure keep me make sure your
[14:42] brother keep me in line here. All right.
[14:44] So, and then then came the famous words,
[14:46] I am that I am. You know, I remember the
[14:48] first time I read those words. You got
[14:50] to remember uh I didn't raise with the
[14:52] knowledge of Christianism.
[14:55] And later in life when I first uh I
[14:58] don't know if you ever know what that
[14:59] feels like is to never uh read a Bible
[15:01] and here you are a young adult and
[15:03] you're reading the Bible like a kid
[15:05] again and then you read where it says I
[15:07] am that I am. It just does something it
[15:09] did something to me. It's like what is
[15:11] that? What why do why do I like it? Why
[15:15] do I think it's so right? Who else
[15:17] answers that way? It's like hey who are
[15:18] you? I am that I am. It's it's a you
[15:21] know am is a verb. And I was reading on
[15:24] this and we'll touch upon this on some
[15:26] future times, Lord willing. But I am is
[15:28] a verb. And I love how in the Spanish
[15:30] Bible when it says John one, it says in
[15:34] the beginning was the word and the word
[15:35] was with God. It actually says in the
[15:36] beginning was the verb
[15:39] and the verb was with God and the word
[15:40] was God. It it refers to a word as a
[15:43] verb. I like that because I can I can
[15:45] see that. I can perceive that in my
[15:46] personal walk with Christ. It's it's
[15:48] alive. It's a word that does. I be. You
[15:52] can say I is. You can say I is with the
[15:55] apostrophe as you know I I is. It's all
[15:58] the same. It's just you're basically in
[16:00] saying I believe he was saying I am he.
[16:03] You know the one the God of Abraham, the
[16:05] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God
[16:06] of that was in Joseph, right? And the
[16:10] God that is not in you because he told
[16:11] him that right before he told him this.
[16:13] So I love that study because how this
[16:15] study came about is you know I was
[16:16] intrigued by that I am but then I said
[16:18] was that the first time I was ever in?
[16:19] And then I went back. Amen. And of
[16:21] course it was said plenty other times
[16:24] going forward. So let's go right into
[16:29] it. And uh in 15
[16:33] 26 he he says I am with I am the Lord. I
[16:37] will not put I would not I will put none
[16:39] of these diseases upon thee which I have
[16:43] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[16:45] Lord that health thee. So here's another
[16:47] attribute of you know I am he's a healer
[16:50] right as we know it and in Ruth I love
[16:52] this in the book of Ruth and he said
[16:55] Boaz I asked a question he says who art
[16:57] thou right and she said I am Ruth I like
[17:01] the confidence here thine handmmaid
[17:03] right brother amen spread therefore thy
[17:05] skirt I think I read that somewhere else
[17:07] where God has spreads over his skirt
[17:08] over his people over thine handmmaid for
[17:11] thou art a near kinsman right isn't that
[17:15] beautiful like he You know what I like
[17:17] about this scripture? He didn't not only
[17:19] tell Boaz who Ruth was herself, he
[17:23] actually told Boaz who he was. Amen. He
[17:27] That's like when you say, "Thou Lord,
[17:28] thou are worthy." When you praise the
[17:29] Lord, you know, "And thou art a near
[17:32] kingsman." Amen. You know, you might be
[17:34] good, but you like it when your children
[17:36] say, "Dad, I think you're doing a good
[17:37] job." Yeah. I mean, that that's okay.
[17:40] It's okay that Ruth tells home. You're
[17:42] like near kingsman. Not just a kingsman,
[17:43] but he was near. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[17:45] And in Psalm 111, I found where it says,
[17:48] "I am thy save me." And I want to bring
[17:50] this up because uh it's going to start
[17:51] getting a little bit more powerful here
[17:52] as we start reading some more of the
[17:54] more I ams. But I want to bring a
[17:55] balance to this where it says, "I'm
[17:57] small." 1941 41. I am despised. Right?
[18:01] Because we know and we've read before
[18:04] that humanly speaking, there's also some
[18:06] other I ams. I am a worm. I am despised.
[18:08] I am weak. Right? So bringing in a
[18:12] balance here that we're not uh hyping up
[18:13] our flesh here when we said I am. Right?
[18:16] So if I get a little bit excited and all
[18:17] that just just re recognize this is not
[18:20] the flesh. I know who the flesh is. I
[18:23] don't want to testify of it this night.
[18:26] All right. Praise the Lord. So on the
[18:28] Song of Solomon's um course the
[18:30] Shulamite uh or the the woman here says
[18:33] I am my beloveds. I am my beloved and my
[18:36] beloved is mine. So he knows who he is
[18:39] too and who she is. He feedth among the
[18:41] liies in in 7:10 he says I am my
[18:45] beloveds and his desires towards me. He
[18:48] just doesn't know him. He knows like
[18:49] Amen. He knows so much about him that
[18:51] like he says he actually desires me. I
[18:54] think that's just personal. I think
[18:56] that's I think that's when we start
[18:57] getting into the I am of you know who
[18:59] the I am in us who who who we are in him
[19:02] and such. Right. So praise the Lord. And
[19:04] this I love it because it also mentions
[19:06] I am. And um there's a song for it, too.
[19:08] And to me, this is just powerful. Fear
[19:10] thou not, for I am with thee. Amen. Be
[19:14] not dismayed, for I am thy God. Surely I
[19:18] will strengthen thee. Surely I will help
[19:21] thee. Will uphold thee with the right
[19:23] hand. With the right hand of my
[19:26] righteousness. Yes. Amen. And then it
[19:29] repeats itself. 4110. If you're
[19:31] discouraged, 4110. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[19:34] It's like didn't say nothing about me.
[19:36] He's other than that he's going to come
[19:37] help me. Amen. And he's going to come
[19:39] strengthen me. I need that to help me to
[19:42] uphold me with the right hand of his
[19:44] righteousness. Amen. Amen. So in
[19:46] Jeremiah, I love this too because this
[19:47] is just more about saying that how he
[19:49] parallels the I am with Jehovah of
[19:51] Jesus. Because this is Jeremiah 3:14,
[19:55] "Turn all backsliding children, say the
[19:57] Lord, for I am married." Pretty clear
[20:01] unto you. I would take you one of a city
[20:04] and two of a family and I will bring you
[20:06] to Zion. Amen. Praise the Lord. Right.
[20:09] And now let's get into a New Testament.
[20:11] So let me catch my breath here. And this
[20:13] is where we'll talk about the New
[20:14] Testament and then we'll share some
[20:15] message quotes and uh and then we'll get
[20:18] to share some testimony. Right. Praise
[20:20] the Lord. So So when Jesus came, this is
[20:22] Matthew
[20:24] 16:13 into the coast of Cesaria
[20:27] Philippi. He asked his disciples saying,
[20:30] so here comes the question again.
[20:32] Whom do men say that I, the son of man,
[20:36] am? Amen. I think he kind of gave him
[20:38] the answer with the question, but
[20:40] whom do man say that I, the son of man,
[20:43] am? I just love the question. Amen. And
[20:45] then in 16:15, he said unto them, but
[20:49] whom do you say that I am? Amen. And
[20:51] that's what Peter had that revelation. I
[20:53] just love that he's basically saying, I
[20:55] am. I am something. Yeah. So, all right,
[20:58] Peter, tell me who I am. In other words,
[20:59] I am, but tell me who I am, Peter. Who
[21:01] do men say? Who do you say? I just love
[21:04] that. I just think that's that's that's
[21:06] beautiful. So, then Matthew, it's just a
[21:08] good reference of the New Testament
[21:10] referring to the same God of the Bible,
[21:12] right? I am the God of Abraham, the God
[21:14] of Isaac, the God of Jacob. Y God is not
[21:18] the God of the dead. Hallelujah. But the
[21:20] living. So, if you're living, praise the
[21:21] Lord. He's a God of you. So, Matthew 22
[21:24] 2046 to 46. I I I love this a lot. So
[21:28] Jesus is kind of giving him a tongue
[21:30] twister here. He's saying, "While the
[21:31] Pharisees were talking, were gathered
[21:33] together, Jesus asked them, saying,
[21:36] "What think ye of Christ?" You notice
[21:38] how it came a question again, right? So
[21:40] he's really asking about himself, but he
[21:41] says, "What think ye of Christ? Whose
[21:43] son is he?" So they said unto him, "The
[21:47] son of David?" He said unto them, "How
[21:49] then does the the David in the spirit
[21:52] call him Lord? saying, "The Lord said
[21:55] unto my Lord, sit thou in my right hand
[21:57] till I make thine enemies thy foottool."
[22:01] If David then can call him Lord, who is
[22:05] his son? Yeah. Right. And no, this is
[22:09] kind of tying back to that subtitle. And
[22:11] no man was able to answer him a word.
[22:13] Amen. Neither does any man from that day
[22:17] forth ask him any more questions. Amen.
[22:21] Shut him up. Actually, I was going to
[22:22] subtitle this. When Diane speaks, all
[22:24] else shuts up. But I thought that was
[22:25] gonna be a bit of a rude word. That's
[22:28] all right. Yeah. But uh all else remain
[22:30] silent. It still is. They surely do.
[22:32] Actually, you read here in the message
[22:33] what Brother Random says is the infidel
[22:35] had no grounds. That's right. In many
[22:37] different places where it basically
[22:38] means it put it it it calmed things. It
[22:42] it put things in their place. Right. So
[22:44] in John 145 to 49, uh I love this. So
[22:48] now this is talking this is going to
[22:49] Nathaniel now. So now we're going
[22:51] to be talking about how God discerned
[22:55] who the I am was in Nathaniel, right?
[22:58] Who he was in in the Lord's side. So we
[23:01] know Philip found Nathaniel. And of
[23:03] course in 47 says Jesus saw Nathaniel
[23:06] coming to him and said unto him, "Behold
[23:10] an Israelite indeed in whom is no G."
[23:13] This is one of those also that just got
[23:15] me to the core when I first read it for
[23:16] myself. Amen.
[23:18] Nathaniel said unto him, "Whence knowest
[23:21] thou me?" Right?
[23:25] So who how who do you know who I am?
[23:27] Yeah. Right. So he didn't actually deny
[23:29] what Jesus told him. Jesus answered and
[23:32] said unto him, "Before that Philip
[23:35] called thee, when thou was under the fig
[23:38] tree, I saw thee." So the question I
[23:40] have for us to think about is what
[23:42] happened underneath that fig tree. And
[23:45] the question I have, that's in the New
[23:47] Testament, but also in the Old
[23:49] Testament, what was it about when Moses
[23:52] told them, "I am has sent me." That did
[23:56] something. Was it that the children of
[23:59] Israel, what did they regard against
[24:01] about the I am that they just said, "Oh,
[24:04] well, he he said it then. Yeah, I
[24:05] believe it." And I want you to really
[24:08] think about what happened underneath
[24:09] that fig tree. Cuz if somebody just
[24:11] says, "Yeah, yeah, I think I saw you
[24:13] okay last time." Yeah. Oh yeah. Well,
[24:15] you don't say words like that. Nathaniel
[24:16] answered him. Yeah. And unto him, Rabbi,
[24:20] thou art the son of God. Thou art the
[24:23] king of Israel. Like three names, right?
[24:25] Rabbi, teacher, master. Thou art the son
[24:28] of God. Thou art the king of Israel.
[24:32] So I wanted to ask. And then Jesus
[24:35] answered and said unto him, because I
[24:37] said I saw
[24:38] thee, unto thee I saw thee under the fig
[24:41] tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see
[24:43] greater things than these. Yeah. So, I
[24:45] really want you to think is what
[24:46] happened underneath that fig tree. But
[24:48] what was special about it, right? Amen.
[24:50] That that it uh that it that it did
[24:54] something to to Nathaniel. She got some
[24:57] water in here. So, uh in sur we would
[24:59] see Jesus. I like how brother Brandon
[25:02] goes into a bit of a of a of a vision in
[25:06] here and he actually sees Nathaniel and
[25:08] he actually sees what Nathaniel was
[25:09] praying too. I think it's very special
[25:12] that a prophet, you know, is built up
[25:13] that
[25:16] way. So, brother Brandham goes on to say
[25:19] in s we would see Jesus probably it was
[25:23] getting evening time when he got in. He
[25:26] knocks on the door and Mrs. Nathaniel
[25:28] come to see the door. Well, if it isn't
[25:31] our friend Philillip. Oh, where is
[25:34] Nathaniel? He's taking a stroll out in
[25:36] the orchard. Orchard. So away he went
[25:40] out in the orchard and he
[25:42] found out there under the tree, the fig
[25:46] tree, he found Nathaniel down on his
[25:48] knees perhaps saying, look what he was
[25:52] praying for. Oh Lord
[25:56] God, that you promised us deliverance.
[26:00] We're looking for it. We've been waiting
[26:02] for it. When will you do it? Oh Lord
[26:09] God, I'm waiting for that promise you
[26:12] give. Amen.
[26:14] I just love that prayer. I think it's
[26:16] sincere. And he says gets up and dust
[26:19] his clothes off like that. And he turned
[26:22] around and who was standing there but
[26:24] Philillip. He said, "Oh, no doubt.
[26:27] Phillip, my friend." He's starting to
[26:29] think, right? And before he said
[26:31] anything, are you getting it wrong or is
[26:33] the trees all right? He had an urgent
[26:36] message. Y something real. He said,
[26:40] "Come see who we found." Oh, right
[26:43] straight to the mark. Come see who we
[26:45] found. Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
[26:48] Joseph. He's the Messiah.
[26:51] I know he is the Messiah. Amen. I just
[26:55] think that's beautiful. I think
[26:57] that I believe that Philillip felt the
[27:01] presence of the Lord. I believe that
[27:02] Philip had an encounter with the am
[27:03] because Jesus said, "I saw thee and we
[27:05] know who I am was." And he told him who
[27:07] he was. And it must have been something
[27:10] so strong for someone just to say,
[27:11] "Okay, yeah, you're it. You're rabbi.
[27:13] You're the king." Yeah. Just think about
[27:14] it. Somebody just doesn't say like, "Oh,
[27:16] yeah. He he he must have told them, I am
[27:19] he. You know, I was there. I saw thee. I
[27:22] saw thee when you were under the fig
[27:23] tree." and only they knew what happened
[27:26] there. Yeah. But I think it's it's uh
[27:28] it's special that God
[27:30] revealed to Nathaniel who he was and who
[27:34] he Nathaniel was in the Lord and who the
[27:37] Lord was in his life and how that Jesus
[27:40] that was there was one and the same.
[27:42] Amen. And I think that right there, my
[27:44] brothers and sisters, has a lot of unity
[27:46] with the the the with the Jew, right,
[27:48] who's praying to Jehovah, right? The God
[27:50] of the Old and Jesus the new right
[27:53] there. and all being revealed in one.
[27:56] So, I personally love that. And in John
[27:58] 1:19, um, we know they they asked John
[28:01] the Baptist similar questions, right?
[28:04] And this is the record of John when the
[28:06] Jews sent priests and Levites from
[28:09] Jerusalem to ask him, "Who art thou,
[28:11] right? Kind of goes to the same." And he
[28:13] confessed and denied not, but confessed,
[28:15] "I am not the Christ." I think that's
[28:17] powerful, too. It's good to know who you
[28:19] are and who you are not or who you
[28:20] ain't, in other words, right? So,
[28:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. And it says, "And
[28:25] he confessed and denied not, but he
[28:27] confessed, I am not the Christ." But
[28:29] what did he say on 23? He said, "I am
[28:31] the voice of one crying in the
[28:33] wilderness. Make straight the path the
[28:35] way of the Lord as say the prophet
[28:37] Isaiah." Amen. And they just there's
[28:40] power when he said that because that's
[28:42] who he was. They they you can't come
[28:44] against that. All else shuts up as
[28:47] brother would say, right? So John 3:28,
[28:50] yourselves bear witness. This is John
[28:52] saying it again that I said I am not the
[28:54] Christ but I am sent before him. But he
[28:56] still knows who he is. He knows his
[28:58] place, right? You know, brother Brandham
[29:00] said the same. So we we definitely
[29:01] appreciate that. I love this one. The
[29:03] woman at the well. The woman at the well
[29:06] said unto him, uh, I know that the
[29:09] Messiah cometh. That's right. Which is
[29:11] called Christ. When he is come, I I love
[29:14] that present word. Like when he is come,
[29:17] is he here? when he's come, he would
[29:19] tell us all things. Jesus said unto her,
[29:22] I Amen. that speaketh unto thee am he.
[29:25] Amen. That's another way of saying I am.
[29:27] By the way, if you didn't catch it,
[29:28] right? And I love this because, you
[29:30] know, I did this study. I really got
[29:32] before the Lord and and I was not just
[29:34] finding the word I am. I am. I am.
[29:36] Because you really have to read through
[29:37] the scriptures and and these names kept
[29:40] on popping into my mind like ah the
[29:41] woman at the whale. He said it's just a
[29:43] revelation. He he did tell them that he
[29:44] was him. So I went to go find it and it
[29:46] wasn't exactly like the you know I am
[29:48] right next to each other but he did say
[29:51] I that speaketh unto thee am he. Amen.
[29:54] So I think that's powerful because you
[29:56] know what happened with that woman that
[29:58] went to the well right and he she went
[30:00] and she testified and he come and see
[30:03] who he found. He told me all about me
[30:05] just because he told him who he was and
[30:07] maybe a little bit about who she was in
[30:09] the flesh but who he was. Encourage her
[30:11] who she will be in Christ. Right. Y
[30:13] he'll give you waters that you will not
[30:15] thirst again. Amen. God is good. So in
[30:18] John 8:18,
[30:20] I am one. This is Jesus that beare
[30:22] witness of myself and the father that
[30:24] sent me bears witness of me. In
[30:28] 8:53, as we know in chapter 8 is what he
[30:31] kind of really duped it out with uh with
[30:33] the u with the Abraham's seed there,
[30:36] right? because they were asking him,
[30:38] "Art thou greater than our father
[30:40] Abraham which is dead and the prophets
[30:44] are dead? Who maketh thou thyself?"
[30:47] Right? So it's a question. And then
[30:49] Jesus told him, "Your father Abraham
[30:51] rejoiced to see my day." Yeah. And he
[30:53] saw it and was glad. Amen. Then said the
[30:56] Jews unto him, "Thou art not yet 50
[30:59] years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
[31:02] Now think about this. Why was he asking
[31:05] Jesus? Why were they asking Jesus,
[31:07] "You're not even 50 yet and you've seen
[31:10] Abraham." He didn't quite say that
[31:12] verbatim. He said, "Your father Abraham
[31:14] rejoiced to see my day." And he saw it,
[31:17] right? And it and he and was glad. But
[31:20] he I think he's starting to perceive
[31:21] that there was a vision going on. He's
[31:23] saying, "Oh, you seen him." And then it
[31:25] says, "Jesus said unto them, verily,
[31:26] verily, I say unto you, before Abraham,
[31:28] I am." Amen. And we know that's a
[31:30] powerful I am. And we know that. We we
[31:32] love that. And to me that's basically it
[31:36] it just shuts up all the unbelief. Amen.
[31:38] Right. When when he uh under the
[31:40] inspiration is able to say I am. I
[31:41] believe it does the same for the
[31:42] believers. And this is where we had
[31:45] spoken about the blind man from birth
[31:46] where where he said uh some said it this
[31:49] is he. Others said he's like him but he
[31:52] said I am. Amen. So I think what matters
[31:55] most and take away from that is is what
[31:57] you say of yourself. you know, regarding
[31:59] the things of the law, not what the
[32:01] naysayers have to say or not what the
[32:03] unbelievers have to say or the world or
[32:05] the devils. Amen. Or this world system.
[32:08] It's just only one person needs to know
[32:09] who I am is in you. That's right. Right.
[32:12] So in John nine, we have here where he
[32:15] said answered and said, "Who is he,
[32:18] Lord, that I may believe on him?" This
[32:21] is the blind man, by the way. Right? And
[32:23] he said unto him,
[32:24] "Thou because they actually told him,"
[32:26] do you know who he who he is so we can
[32:28] go take us to him?" And he says, "I
[32:30] don't I don't know." Remember, he was
[32:31] blind when he told him, "Go wash." So
[32:33] then he encounters Jesus again here. And
[32:35] Jesus said unto him, "Thou hast both
[32:38] seen him, and it is he that talkth with
[32:41] thee. I am I am." Amen. I am the the one
[32:44] that healed you basically, right? From
[32:46] from the from the blindness. So John 13.
[32:49] Now I tell you before it come that when
[32:52] it come to pass you believe that I am
[32:54] he. Amen. So I think Jesus really was
[32:57] all about identification of who's the
[32:59] disciples were who he was who his father
[33:01] was who we will be who the bride will be
[33:04] who his children will be who um the the
[33:08] unbeliever is. And I just think it's
[33:10] beautiful to uh to bring it together
[33:12] here in and and in this walk here and
[33:14] and and to remember who I am is in you.
[33:18] all your testimonies, all the things
[33:20] that he has done for you. And if you
[33:22] ever run out of I ams, you can always
[33:23] take anything he said about you and say,
[33:25] "I am that one. I am the healed one. I
[33:28] am." And we'll see examples of some
[33:30] people did that and actually said it,
[33:31] you know, even the when brother Brandham
[33:33] um his plane was grounded. He says, "I
[33:35] am a type of that, you know, shootite
[33:38] woman." So she he actually it says,
[33:40] "Where's my Elijah?" Right? So it's just
[33:43] some beautiful things, right? Uh I think
[33:45] when we start pondering upon these
[33:46] things in John 14, believe me that I am
[33:49] in the father and the father in me or
[33:52] else believe me for the very work's
[33:54] sake. Uh so I want to also visit this
[33:58] one because this is about
[33:59] Jesus and I think um it's also very
[34:02] powerful here. Jesus therefore knowing
[34:05] all things that uh should come upon him
[34:09] went forth and said unto them whom seek
[34:11] ye and remember this is when they were
[34:14] going to go uh bring Jesus to take him
[34:16] to the cross then answer
[34:19] him Jesus of Nazareth that that's who
[34:22] they were looking for right
[34:24] so what did Jesus do right Jesus said
[34:26] unto them I am he amen I love that
[34:29] because when he said I am he it's the
[34:31] most powerful demonstration here when uh
[34:34] and it says and Judas also which
[34:36] betrayed him stood with them. But this
[34:39] is what I like about the I am there. As
[34:41] soon as as soon then as he had said unto
[34:44] them I am he, they went backwards and
[34:47] fell to the ground. So I just want to
[34:49] ask you know why did that happen? You
[34:52] know why? Why was that I am such a
[34:54] personal testimony? Because they they
[34:55] asked the
[34:56] question and they said Jesus of
[34:58] Nazareth. I I think if anybody else
[35:00] would have spoken, oh, he's right here.
[35:02] It would have not had the same effect,
[35:03] right? I think
[35:06] that we got to remember that when we say
[35:08] I am healed or I am God's son or I am
[35:13] whatever is against you that God
[35:15] promised you that will be defeat the
[35:17] word that will fee the devil any place
[35:19] any time under any circumstance. I think
[35:22] it does this. I think it has that effect
[35:24] when it is deity speaking in human
[35:26] flesh. Right. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[35:29] And um in Revelations here and then
[35:30] we'll soon go to some of the message
[35:32] quotes uh where we find this. I am alpha
[35:35] and omega.
[35:37] We know that was said in the Old
[35:38] Testament of of Jehovah the old. The
[35:40] beginning and the ending said the Lord
[35:43] which is and which was and which is to
[35:45] come, the Almighty. Amen. And then in
[35:48] 111 he's saying, I am Alpha and Omega,
[35:51] the first and the last. And what thou
[35:54] seeest write in a book and send it out
[35:56] to the seven churches, praise the Lord,
[35:58] which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and
[36:00] unto Smyrna, and unto Spamos, and unto
[36:02] Thya, Sardis in Philadelphia, and onto
[36:05] Lai. Praise the Lord. And um last
[36:09] scripture I have here is I Jesus have
[36:12] sent my angel. So that this is
[36:16] revelation. He he said he was Jesus.
[36:18] That's right. Because I know that you
[36:19] know alpha, omega, all is powerful, the
[36:21] almighty. Right. I am Jesus. I Jesus
[36:24] have sent my angel to testify unto these
[36:27] things to you to testify unto you these
[36:29] things in the churches. I am the rude
[36:32] and the offspring of David and the
[36:35] bright and morning star. Amen. Well,
[36:38] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Yeah.
[36:40] I just want to encourage you with the
[36:42] scriptures and u we'll we'll share some
[36:44] of the instances in where in the message
[36:46] that God sent to us this age through the
[36:49] prophet William Brandom. Amen. Um, I
[36:52] like to speak a little bit about that
[36:54] blind girl. Amen.
[36:57] And I looked, this isn't believe ye that
[37:00] I am able to do this.
[37:04] I noticed that. So, and then it says,
[37:07] "And I looked, my heart was just a
[37:09] breaking. I said, look, lady, perhaps
[37:12] I'm the one you want to see." and
[37:16] friends. I never forget those hands
[37:19] grabbed me by the lapel and like that
[37:23] and she said, "Is you the healer?" I
[37:26] said, "No, I am brother Brandham." I
[37:30] said, "Jesus is the healer." Amen. I
[37:32] think that's just a good balance right
[37:33] there where it just it just who else
[37:36] could have done that right right there
[37:37] other than the person who was
[37:40] who was being sought after who who was
[37:42] at that time who this young lady wanted
[37:46] to go contact through whom Jesus was
[37:49] going to work through whom the great I
[37:51] am was going to work I just think it's a
[37:53] beautiful story is is how when brother
[37:56] Brandham said you know I am I think what
[37:58] can the devil do at that point right
[38:00] she's the one that came with the faith
[38:01] and and she's blind and found him. Yeah.
[38:03] Right. Amen. I mean, is that's not God.
[38:06] Right. It It's beautiful. Amen. Sister
[38:09] Hetty, right? You know, it's one that
[38:11] came to my mind. I believe that when she
[38:13] said that's nothing but the truth. Amen.
[38:15] I I believe she had an experience before
[38:17] that. Amen. Cuz why why would you just
[38:19] say that's nothing but the truth? Amen.
[38:21] Had she experienced God's power and
[38:24] creation? Cuz brother Bandham said that
[38:25] there's much said about this that there
[38:27] was a super super anointing. Yes. That
[38:30] came upon her. Amen. and even said that
[38:31] was the first time it's been done on a
[38:33] human for whatever reason. I I just
[38:35] think it's beautiful. I know more than
[38:37] said that until sister had sitting there
[38:41] crying. So this wasn't just like uh
[38:43] might be true if you say so. She knew
[38:47] that what brother Brandon was saying was
[38:49] nothing but the truth. She believed it.
[38:52] I think the I am had revealed that to
[38:54] her before that. Yeah, ma'am. Before I
[38:56] saw you, we you were when you were under
[38:58] the fig tree. Yeah.
[39:00] before God met with Sister Hadtie. And
[39:04] this was just her opportunity to say, "I
[39:06] believe it. Amen. I am." That was the I
[39:08] am. I believe that the I am created
[39:10] those girls. Amen. That was her her
[39:11] testimony of her saying that. I want to
[39:13] throw a little bit upon this one because
[39:15] um the Shinomite woman in type I called
[39:18] it here to to remember myself. And I and
[39:21] I turned around. This is when God
[39:22] grounded that airplane, right? So I
[39:24] turned around and said, "How do you know
[39:27] I was a person?" remember a question?
[39:30] And she said, "Parson, did you ever read
[39:33] in the Bible about that Shounomite woman
[39:34] that had a baby by
[39:37] promise?" I said, "Yes, auntie, I read
[39:41] that many a time. I preached on it not
[39:43] long ago." She
[39:45] said, "I's that kind of woman, too."
[39:48] That's right. If just to interpret that,
[39:49] that means I am. I that kind of woman,
[39:52] too. I told the Lord if he gave me a
[39:56] child I'd raise him for him or I raised
[39:59] it for him said parson the Lord give me
[40:02] a boy and I raised him till he was in
[40:07] his teens said I took he took a road
[40:12] that was wrong got out with some bad
[40:14] company said he's lying here dying now
[40:19] he's caught a bad disease and the
[40:21] doctors can't do nothing for him. Said
[40:24] they gave him all kinds of shots, but
[40:27] said he's a backslider and said he's
[40:31] lying in here dying. Said he'd been
[40:35] unconscious since day before yesterday
[40:37] and said he don't know nothing. He
[40:42] thinks it's out he's out in the deep sea
[40:46] somewhere cold. And he said, "Par said,
[40:48] "It just breaks my heart to see my boy
[40:51] die like that." I said, "I want him
[40:56] saved." And I said, and said, I prayed
[41:00] all night and I said, Lord, you give me
[41:02] that baby. But where's the Elijah? Amen.
[41:07] You got to see how many I ams are in
[41:08] this picture. Amen. She said, "Now,
[41:11] Lord, you help me. don't let me don't
[41:16] let me my baby die like this and said
[41:20] and the Lord told me this morning I said
[41:24] I kind of fell asleep and there in the
[41:26] chair and I dreamed that I was to come
[41:28] out here and stand in this gate and I'd
[41:32] see a man coming dressed like you is
[41:36] oh my you know how that makes you feel
[41:42] in other
[41:43] the this woman was telling him who
[41:46] brotherham was, right? He didn't care
[41:48] about, "Oh, you never heard about me."
[41:49] Yeah. It's funny because brother Bandom
[41:51] usually would not even he kind of shy
[41:52] away from, you know, saying who he was
[41:54] and all that. He were not interested on
[41:56] that. He started I know who you are. He
[41:58] was dressed like like you is. I love
[42:01] that. Now, I want to I want to testify
[42:02] here a little bit of something is so
[42:04] we've heard about
[42:06] we've heard about uh God grounding an
[42:08] airplane, right? to to meet the need of
[42:12] a sister and of his son. But have you
[42:15] heard in the message where God stopped
[42:16] the train?
[42:20] Look at this same message
[42:24] expectation and then it goes on to say a
[42:27] few months after that story hadn't ended
[42:31] I was passing through on a
[42:34] train and I stopped in to get something
[42:38] to eat.
[42:40] I heard somebody holler, "Parson
[42:42] Brandom." He was pulling one of these
[42:45] little old carts around like that down
[42:47] there at the station working. He run and
[42:50] grabbed a hold of my hand, said, "You
[42:53] remember me?" I said, "No, I don't." He
[42:56] said, "I
[42:58] was the boy." Amen. You come that
[43:03] morning that the Lord let you down there
[43:08] when Mammy was praying says Parson
[43:11] Brandom eyes perfectly whole now. Amen.
[43:15] And I's a Christian now. Amen. Now, in
[43:17] case you didn't catch it, I would like
[43:18] to point out four I ams in here. He said
[43:21] who he was, right? Notice I say I was
[43:23] that boy. Because he's he's a different
[43:25] creation now, right? So he said I was
[43:28] that boy. There was that boy. who
[43:30] recognizes who he was, who he is. And
[43:32] then it says that morning when the Lord,
[43:34] the I am led you down there, when Mammy,
[43:37] her mom, she who knew who she was, and
[43:39] she knew who Elijah was unto him and who
[43:41] his boy was. And she testified it. She
[43:43] said, "I asked the Lord." She was just
[43:45] like that should my woman. I I I needed
[43:47] a boy of promise. I asked that boy. She
[43:50] gave it onto me. And now now here we
[43:52] are. And then here it says Mamuel was
[43:54] there. And then it says was praying. It
[43:56] says Parson Brandom. There's brother
[43:58] Bham who who was there who was the I am
[44:01] that was who the Lord worked through and
[44:03] he says I perfectly whole now. In other
[44:05] words, he says I am. Amen. I am healed.
[44:08] I'm perfectly whole. I'm a believer. I'm
[44:10] a Christian now. I think I think that's
[44:13] a beautiful beautiful response. Amen. To
[44:16] faith and and and to testimony. And I
[44:19] just love how it ties. You know, I
[44:21] didn't think about that before is how
[44:22] God stopped a train. We always hear how
[44:25] God stopped uh the airplane and he
[44:27] grounded the airplane, right? So, I just
[44:29] think that that's just a beautiful uh
[44:32] follow through to that miraculous
[44:34] healing, right? When that little boy was
[44:37] was healed in identification. Uh I I I
[44:40] couldn't leave this one out with the
[44:41] little boy in the mirror. That was
[44:43] another I think revelation the little
[44:45] boy had of who he was. And of course,
[44:48] that testifies of us, right? And
[44:49] identification, we know the story,
[44:51] right? A visiting grandmother. He didn't
[44:53] have exposure to mirrors before. And
[44:56] then he started, I'll skip down to the
[44:58] last verses. And he started to the to
[45:00] the little boy, excuse me, one more. And
[45:02] he had been closed the door since they
[45:04] come in. But it and in the mirror on the
[45:08] on his side and he saw a little boy and
[45:12] he started to the little boy, you know,
[45:14] to make friends with him and he began to
[45:16] look into this glass. He's got up close.
[45:20] I think that's what we got to do
[45:21] sometimes. Right. Right. Amen. Yes. Is
[45:23] that me? Get that right reflection on
[45:25] that light there. Through the message,
[45:27] through the lens of the message, the
[45:29] light shining on this day in our Bibles.
[45:31] And he began to to look into this this
[45:34] glass and he got up close and he turned
[45:36] around and said, "Why, mama? That's me."
[45:39] I think that's just a beautiful example
[45:40] of when we come to that realization of
[45:42] this message is speaking to us. You
[45:44] know, I want to say something to
[45:45] the to the brethren or people who who um
[45:50] who've uh gone astray or had questions
[45:53] about this message or are
[45:56] denying Christ's message to this age.
[45:59] You can't tell me that. No, sir. I am
[46:01] he. I am who this message came to. I am
[46:04] the bride of Christ. I'm a portion of
[46:06] God's son in this earth. I believe
[46:08] Christ's works on this page. I believe
[46:10] what God spoke through his prophet
[46:13] Malachi 4. Amen. And I believe it is
[46:14] true. I am he. Get thee behind me,
[46:17] Satan. Amen.
[46:20] Intelligence. Show us the
[46:22] father. And I said, you think on this on
[46:25] that while I go squirrel hunting, right?
[46:29] And we know the story when brother
[46:31] Brandham came to the infidel, right? And
[46:34] then um and it I'll I'll read it here.
[46:37] And I said, "You think on that a while?"
[46:39] I go scroll hunting. And then when I
[46:42] come back, if you will tell me what
[46:45] intelligence, he asked a question, "What
[46:48] intelligence makes the apple tree hide
[46:50] in the winter?" It says, "I'll go
[46:51] squirrel hunting. If you tell me what
[46:52] intelligence tells that sap in that
[46:55] tree, that life, go down in the roots
[46:58] and hide till spring, then come back up
[47:01] again." When you find out what
[47:03] intelligence works that life up down up
[47:07] and down through that tree at the
[47:10] seasons I in other words I am would tell
[47:13] you what intelligence told me y that
[47:16] that woman was going to be healed
[47:20] said told you told you I said yes sir I
[47:24] said he said you're not that preacher I
[47:27] said I am brother amen right that's it
[47:30] it's simple guys right And he said, "Can
[47:32] you prove it?" I said,
[47:35] "Sure." I said, "I guess I don't look
[47:38] like it." He was the man I was asking,
[47:40] right? I like how he responded, "The
[47:42] infidel." He said, "No, I admire that."
[47:45] He said, "You look
[47:49] human." Praise the Lord. I said, "Well,"
[47:52] I said, "Well," I said to that, "Well,"
[47:56] I said, "All right, sir." And he said,
[48:00] "Are you that
[48:02] minister?" I just think that's
[48:04] beautiful. Is is who can argue with him?
[48:06] I mean, here is an infidel, one of the
[48:08] strongest infidel, right, that that come
[48:10] across. And he said, "Uh, there's only
[48:13] one thing I like to know out of all in
[48:16] the world and out of all the people in
[48:17] the world, asking the right question to
[48:19] the right person at the right time.
[48:21] That'll bring out the I am."
[48:24] True, brother. Amen. Get in this world.
[48:25] Find out who you are and and just say
[48:27] it. Yeah, you say it. I think it's
[48:30] beautiful that uh I just think that that
[48:32] I think at that point is just it's just
[48:35] if there's anything of God inside you,
[48:36] it is impossible to unbelieve anymore.
[48:38] Right. Right.
[48:41] When I tell you too, I am he who God
[48:45] saved who God sanctify is in the process
[48:48] of doing that. who filled me with this
[48:50] Holy Ghost and his fire and who has
[48:52] given me this message and he who is he
[48:54] who's raptured my soul will rapture this
[48:56] flesh too give me a new body praise the
[48:58] Lord
[49:00] I said yes sir and he had asked are you
[49:02] that minister the same God that can
[49:05] speak to a tree can speak to a man
[49:09] and there I led the old fellow to Christ
[49:14] intelligence now this is going back to
[49:16] the subtitle source we would see Jesus
[49:18] Then asked this question, what
[49:20] intelligence runs that sap out of the
[49:23] tree down into the roots to hide in the
[49:25] for the winter? Oh, that infidel has no
[49:29] grounds. Right. Amen. Come to Christ.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:35] I'd like to
[49:36] um this is one of the last notes I have
[49:38] here about the ranch bride. I call it
[49:41] the ranch bride for lack of better
[49:42] words. But this is
[49:45] when the sons, the boss sons of the
[49:49] armor company in Chicago went out to go
[49:52] look for a a a wife, a bride, right? And
[49:56] there's much to be said about that, but
[49:59] I just want to capture how she believed
[50:01] that she believed who she was, right?
[50:03] And she manifested it. She don't care
[50:06] about the people score laughing and
[50:08] making jokes. I mean it don't really
[50:10] hurt her when she's got the real faith,
[50:12] right? So she said, "But he promised
[50:15] me." Amen. I was there when it happened,
[50:17] right? So I guess I don't know. Amen.
[50:20] Said he promised. He has promised. Said,
[50:23] "I believe his word." Amen. Right. I am.
[50:27] Yeah. When you respond I am to life's
[50:30] question, there is a power, a truth, and
[50:34] a life that follows such response. All
[50:38] right, brother. Amen. And I would like
[50:40] to just uh encourage you here with a few
[50:43] scriptures. And um if you ever want to
[50:48] encourage yourself, these are some of
[50:50] some of the things you can that you
[50:52] already know, but you can just speak
[50:53] them out, believe them, pray them,
[50:55] praise them, make songs about them.
[50:57] Amen. I am created in God's image.
[51:01] Right? That would defeat the devil any
[51:02] place under any circumstance when you're
[51:04] asking about the way you look or things
[51:06] like that. I am fearfully and
[51:08] wonderfully made. I am a child of God. I
[51:12] am loved unconditionally.
[51:14] I am chosen. Yes, I'm a new creation.
[51:17] All Bible words. Yep. He already
[51:19] defeated devil with these. Do the same.
[51:21] It would do the same today again. I am a
[51:23] new creation. I am God's masterpiece. I
[51:27] am a temple of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[51:29] Amen. I am. It's just what what he made
[51:32] me to be. Amen. It's not a question,
[51:34] right? It's the truth. Amen. He made
[51:39] you to be a temple of the Holy Spirit. I
[51:42] am forgiven. I am redeemed. Amen. I am
[51:45] justified. I am sanctified. I
[51:48] am not just a conqueror. I'm more Amen.
[51:52] than a conqueror.
[51:54] I am a co-air with Christ. I am the salt
[51:58] of the earth. I am the light of the
[52:00] world. I am a citizen of heaven. I am
[52:04] seated in Christ in heavenly places. I
[52:06] am free of from condemnation.
[52:10] I
[52:12] know what I was
[52:14] like. I know what it's like to be
[52:16] condemned. So, I also recognize his
[52:19] liberation and his freedom. Amen. I can
[52:21] say that with a lot of thanksgiving.
[52:22] Yes. You know, I'm free. Yes. I'm
[52:25] thankful to be free. I am a friend of
[52:28] God. I am God's workmanship. I am God's
[52:32] ambassador. I am God's husbandry. It
[52:35] means a field and building. Right? I am
[52:38] a royal priesthood. I am part of God's
[52:41] family. Amen. That's a good I am strong
[52:45] in the Lord. Amen. I'm weak, but I'm
[52:46] strong in the Lord. Amen. I am an
[52:48] overcomer by the blood of the lamb.
[52:52] I am bold in Christ. I am blessed with
[52:55] every spiritual blessings. I am holy, a
[52:58] blameless, blameless before God. I am
[53:02] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[53:05] I am complete in Christ. I am called to
[53:09] be there to bear fruit. Amen. I am free
[53:12] in Christ. I am hidden in with Christ in
[53:14] God. Amen. I am hidden with Christ in
[53:17] God. That's Galatians 3:3. I am a member
[53:20] of the body of Christ. I am a living
[53:23] stone in God's spiritual house. I am
[53:27] risen with Christ. I am God's
[53:29] possession. I am victorious through
[53:31] faith. I am alive unto God. Amen. Amen.
[53:33] I think I believe every one of these. I
[53:35] know you do as well. So, I think we have
[53:38] wonderful promises. We have Jesus
[53:40] himself who said, "I am the bread of
[53:42] life. I am the truth. I am the way. I am
[53:46] the life. I am the door, the gate. I am
[53:49] the good shepherd.
[53:50] And I am divine in many different places
[53:54] that Jesus said who he was where we said
[53:57] where we were at where brother Random
[53:59] said who he was and revealed and and
[54:01] where we are going to say I am and
[54:04] caused the greater works. Amen. I just
[54:06] want to encourage you that when we read
[54:08] our Bibles, keep on collecting the many
[54:11] places where
[54:13] where it says about who you are and just
[54:16] keep on believing him, right?
[54:19] Keep on um keeping on keep on uh keep on
[54:23] the fight. Keep on being encouraged. You
[54:25] know, may every word that proceedes out
[54:27] of the mouth of God, right? It just
[54:29] caused you to um to grow, to change and
[54:33] to be delivered and to be healed and set
[54:35] free. So that's what I have for this
[54:38] morning as if this evening is that I am
[54:41] that I am is is in us. I am Amen. was in
[54:44] the message that he sent for
[54:47] us. It's there too. He says I sent you
[54:50] Elijah. Amen. So you am the recipient of
[54:52] that. That's right. Amen. It's uh it's
[54:55] beautiful guys. We're really thankful to
[54:57] be a part of his chosen bride and be a
[55:00] child of God this evening. Amen. So with
[55:02] that, let's stand to our feet and pray.
[55:09] Oh God, you're so merciful and you are
[55:11] so true and you are who you say you are.
[55:14] You are
[55:15] uh wonderful, Lord. Uh you're the only
[55:18] one that we can come and run to when all
[55:21] else fails. We we thank you so much for
[55:24] giving us such a spiritual truth in this
[55:26] hour in this age. We're asking that you
[55:30] will continue to build up uh this
[55:32] portion of your bride, Father, and the
[55:33] bride around the world. We thank you so
[55:36] much. We ask all who are thirst. We say
[55:39] come drink from the fountains of water
[55:41] of life freely. God, you're given so
[55:44] much in so many places. Your your words
[55:47] are rich and they do accomplish what you
[55:50] send them out to do. We pray for those
[55:52] who are yet to come in, Father, to your
[55:54] fold that you will encourage them along
[55:56] in their walk. We pray for those who are
[55:59] by your grace saved and have been sealed
[56:01] with your holy ghost of promise that you
[56:04] will continue to do, Father, in their
[56:06] life and continue to encourage them and
[56:09] continue to sustain them, Father, and
[56:11] give them your faith when our faith runs
[56:13] out. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[56:16] Amen. God bless you, brothers. Praise
[56:19] the Lord.
[56:24] God bless you, brother. Praise the Lord.
[56:26] Thank you.
[56:29] Amen. Amen. Just give me one more.
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:46] He's going to take a rapture.
[56:49] Thank you. I hope you got that.
[56:52] Who's going to take a body chain? I am.
[56:57] Okay. And through him, he's going to do
[57:00] it through you. So, I am that I am.
[57:07] That's what uh that's what I see about
[57:09] that scripture. He's saying I am that I
[57:13] am. I'm talking to you about that's who
[57:14] I am. I am that I am that I am. And it's
[57:17] very personal.
[57:19] cuz there's no there's no it just takes
[57:22] a revelation to know who I am is cuz you
[57:26] it's it comes with a name. It comes with
[57:28] a many many titles but it's one man
[57:30] Jesus Christ. He stood there Moses stood
[57:34] there in front of Pharaoh and Mo and
[57:37] Pharaoh looked around and
[57:39] said, "I don't see no army, man. I got
[57:42] millions. Uh, I got all kind of military
[57:45] might here and and uh you're standing
[57:47] there with your your brother and your
[57:50] brother can't even talk. I mean, you
[57:51] can't even talk. Your brother's having
[57:52] to talk for you. Who's going who's going
[57:55] to deliver your people? Moses looked at
[57:57] him, I believe, and he said, "I am cuz
[58:00] the I am told him he was the one who was
[58:02] going to do it." So, Moses said
[58:05] personally, "I am." And who took him
[58:07] out? We know God did, but through who?
[58:10] Moses. through the I am. Moses said,
[58:13] "I'm going to take him out of here." So,
[58:14] let's sing a song. God bless you.
[58:17] Good job, brother.
[58:24] And I lift my
[58:30] voice to

[1:00:58] Amen. God bless you. Thank you for uh uh
[1:01:01] coming tonight. We sure appreciate our
[1:01:03] brother. Good job. We really appreciate
[1:01:06] that. And uh we look forward to
[1:01:09] uh to more parts of that. More of the I
[1:01:13] am. You can't exhaust the I am. That's
[1:01:16] right. You want to exhaust something
[1:01:18] that's eternal. No, you can't do that.
[1:01:20] But God bless you. Sunday we have
[1:01:22] Mother's Day coming up. and um bring
[1:01:25] your mothers or go visit your mother
[1:01:28] afterwards. Actually, we're having
[1:01:29] communion and footwashing, but um we
[1:01:31] have something from the church for all
[1:01:33] the the sisters here. And uh just keep
[1:01:36] Sister June in your prayer because um
[1:01:40] Amy's in that late stage of dementia
[1:01:43] and we've seen that
[1:01:46] um experienced it with with dad and um
[1:01:50] it's not pretty. And she's pretty much
[1:01:53] she didn't have she doesn't have a whole
[1:01:54] lot of support. She's got a brother that
[1:01:56] lives in in um Charleston, South
[1:01:59] Carolina. Daddy lives in South Carolina
[1:02:00] and he's 92. and and uh she's just
[1:02:03] pretty much doing a lot of it by
[1:02:05] herself. And uh soon as we got home off
[1:02:08] of the plane uh Monday from Jamaica, she
[1:02:11] turned around, packed another bag, and
[1:02:12] went straight down there. So, she's
[1:02:14] coming back tomorrow, though. But just
[1:02:16] pray that she will be strong. And um I
[1:02:20] just
[1:02:21] pray as Sister Janine was asking about
[1:02:25] um Andy there, I want you to remember
[1:02:29] Amy. I just I just pray the
[1:02:32] Lord's wake her up just for two
[1:02:35] minutes. Let her come to herself for
[1:02:38] just a couple of minutes so she can
[1:02:40] realize what position she's in and
[1:02:43] what's going to happen if God don't
[1:02:45] touch her life. And if God doesn't touch
[1:02:47] her life, I want him to touch her soul.
[1:02:50] All she's got to do is say, "God, I'm
[1:02:51] sorry for everything I did." What a
[1:02:54] mighty God. Amen. We don't have to do
[1:02:56] penance. We don't have to do say Hail
[1:02:58] Marys. We don't have to say 45 verses
[1:03:00] and know even know who brother Brandon
[1:03:02] was. Hello somebody. Exactly. She just
[1:03:06] needs to know Jesus Christ. Right. And I
[1:03:09] just pray the Lord to give her that
[1:03:11] amount of time to say, "God, I'm sorry
[1:03:13] for what I did." And if God takes her
[1:03:16] own, that's fine with me. We all want
[1:03:18] our brothers and sisters there, right?
[1:03:19] We want our kids there. We want
[1:03:20] everybody there. We want everybody. And
[1:03:23] all they've got to do is say, "I'm
[1:03:24] sorry." So just remember them. And uh
[1:03:27] June will be back like I said tomorrow
[1:03:28] and then we'll have this weekend coming
[1:03:30] up and uh just rejoice in the Lord. We
[1:03:33] love all of you. We thank you so much
[1:03:35] for praying while we were gone. Uh if
[1:03:37] you want to watch I know some of you
[1:03:39] already watched the sermon on the um
[1:03:43] Spoken Word Apostolic Tabernacle website
[1:03:47] or the Facebook page. But if you go to
[1:03:49] Keith Reed's Facebook page, you will see
[1:03:52] the u uh the party they gave him for for
[1:03:56] the 30 years. And um and you'll you'll
[1:03:59] hear something you'll never you've never
[1:04:00] heard
[1:04:02] before. You know how we sing that um we
[1:04:06] sing that song that um about God and
[1:04:10] what he's done for us and they play it
[1:04:12] about four times faster. It's a it's
[1:04:14] it's almost it's almost really really
[1:04:17] fast. the goodness of God. Mhm.
[1:04:20] Yeah. Listen to it and see if you can
[1:04:22] tell me what you don't even know what
[1:04:24] the song is, but man, after you do it,
[1:04:25] it's just so beautiful. It's so pretty.
[1:04:27] But it's it's in Jamaica time. It's not
[1:04:30] It's not It's not It's not in southern
[1:04:32] time. It's in Jamaica time. So, but they
[1:04:34] had a real good time. They said to tell
[1:04:36] y'all thank you and love you. Brother
[1:04:38] Keith has always
[1:04:40] always everywhere he goes, he has told
[1:04:43] that group of any group of people that
[1:04:46] he knew brother Dale and he listened in
[1:04:49] and he was a part of our church family
[1:04:52] being at 600 700 miles away. So he's
[1:04:55] never denied that. He's always said that
[1:04:57] he got fed through this ministry and
[1:05:00] then now he's took that ministry and he
[1:05:02] has one of his own and a real good one.
[1:05:04] And he's very revered all over the uh um
[1:05:08] even in Africa now. He's going to Ghana
[1:05:10] and different places and and Kenya and
[1:05:13] he is uh wants me to go to Kenya with
[1:05:15] him next year. So we'll be praying about
[1:05:16] it. You want to go? Oh yeah. Anderson.
[1:05:20] Oh yeah. But just keep us just keep that
[1:05:23] in prayer for brother Keith and keep us
[1:05:25] in prayer. He's uh uh you know he met
[1:05:27] several brothers over there in in uh in
[1:05:29] Kenya and he was preaching and when he
[1:05:31] got done they came to him and said you
[1:05:35] know Samuel
[1:05:38] Dale. He said yeah. He said he said you
[1:05:42] preach just like him. They've had the
[1:05:44] tapes for ever how many years they've
[1:05:46] been watching and listening to dad way
[1:05:48] back when. I don't know how they got
[1:05:49] them but they told him said you sound
[1:05:52] like Sam Dale. We think we're just
[1:05:54] preaching to 20 or 30 or 50 or 100, but
[1:05:58] the world. His voice goes around the
[1:05:59] world. Amen. And it's never going to
[1:06:01] stop. But we praise God for that. That's
[1:06:04] not bragging. That's just telling you
[1:06:06] the word of the Lord's going places that
[1:06:07] we don't even know it's going. And then
[1:06:10] when it's then when it's an opportunity
[1:06:12] for someone else to preach it and to
[1:06:14] realize that that that ministry is
[1:06:16] continuing
[1:06:17] on, even over in Kenya, different places
[1:06:20] like that. We sure do. Praise the Lord
[1:06:22] for that. So, let's bow our heads and be
[1:06:25] dismissed. Dear heavenly father, thank
[1:06:27] you. Our brother poured his heart out,
[1:06:29] Father. And I pray that you'll just be
[1:06:30] with him. Comfort him, Lord, that that
[1:06:34] there's many things that was said,
[1:06:35] Father, that went deep into our heart
[1:06:38] that to be confident and to know who
[1:06:39] that I am is know where you are and what
[1:06:43] you're doing. Father, thank you so much
[1:06:46] for for an opportunity to be in this
[1:06:48] great message of the hour. As our
[1:06:50] brother said, there's nothing else like
[1:06:51] it.
[1:06:52] You can't talk me out of this, Satan. No
[1:06:54] way. There's no one on this earth talked
[1:06:56] you out of that. If you're born again by
[1:06:58] the Holy Spirit of God, you'll never be
[1:06:59] talked out of believing this message cuz
[1:07:02] it's you, Lord. It's you in bride form
[1:07:05] now. And you through a prophet said she
[1:07:09] is him. So, we are the part of the I am
[1:07:12] we're to play in the end time. Father,
[1:07:15] give us strength. Be with each one,
[1:07:17] Lord, that's had prayer request and
[1:07:19] touch each one, Father, as we come back
[1:07:21] together Sunday and honor our mothers.
[1:07:24] Father, I pray that you'd be with each
[1:07:25] one, Lord. Keep each one strong,
[1:07:27] healthy, be with Brother Bob as he's
[1:07:29] traveling and also Brother Aaron will be
[1:07:31] gone to Ohio, Lord, preaching for them.
[1:07:33] Father, I pray that you'd be with them.
[1:07:35] Thank you for giving them time to get
[1:07:37] out, Lord, and and go spread the gospel.
[1:07:39] I pray that you'd give us all traveling
[1:07:41] mercies home tonight till we come back
[1:07:43] together Sunday. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:07:46] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
