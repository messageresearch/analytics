[10:46] thoughts of what we've been speaking on
[10:48] in faith
[10:50] and if you'd like to turn back into
[10:51] scripture where we've been on Hebrews 11
[10:55] and then we'll go to habakkuk
[10:58] 2 Hebrews 11 habakkuk 2 now remember the

[12:25] remember that so remember it would be
[12:27] chicken tenders and fish not hot dogs
[12:30] they decided that would work work better
[12:32] with the frying of all the stuff and
[12:35] fixing it amen uh remember to continue
[12:38] to pray for a little Abby having the
[12:40] troubles and all with the the parts
[12:42] there it's some kind of a thing going
[12:45] around and and they don't want to bring
[12:47] her out until because she it was
[12:49] contagious as long as you've run the
[12:51] temperature so they don't want her to be
[12:53] around the children in tanks and all
[12:55] like that or don't want to pass it on
[12:57] she's watching them sir today so we say
[12:59] hey Abby Abby and we'll we'll we miss

[13:08] see if I got all my announcements
[13:11] um
[13:12] oh we will not be having the communion
[13:17] that would be our first Sunday so we're
[13:19] not going to have the Communion next
[13:22] Sunday we will have it the week after
[13:24] for this time only this month only
[13:27] because of the afternoon service you
[13:30] know and the eating and things we won't
[13:32] have the communion without the communion
[13:35] on the second Sunday instead of the
[13:38] first for this month only so remember
[13:41] that all right
[13:42] the heavenly father we thank you for
[13:45] your love your grace your kindness
[13:47] thank you for you and we just ask you
[13:50] now that you have your way with each one
[13:51] of us Lord and father that we could sit
[13:54] down just for a moment and listen and
[13:57] let you speak to our hearts and our
[13:59] lives we love you and we thank you we
[14:02] just commit everything into your hands
[14:04] remember all of these that are sick Lord
[14:06] and just touch each one and just let
[14:09] your delivering power be there to heal
[14:12] because we believe it and we ask you to
[14:15] have your way with us here today as we
[14:18] try to speak your word you come and
[14:20] speak to each one of our hearts and
[14:21] lives forgive our sins
[14:23] cleanse us and keep us in your loving
[14:25] grace in Jesus name
[14:28] amen
[14:30] now remember what we were talking about
[14:32] last Sunday or what was it this past
[14:35] Wednesday when we were using uh Hebrews
[14:38] 10 38
[14:42] that
[14:43] the thought
[14:45] Paul is laying down is about faith
[14:50] all right because you say in verse 38
[14:52] there you know the just shall live by
[14:54] faith all right so then when he comes
[14:57] down a couple of verses then you start
[15:00] the 11th chapter and verse one and look
[15:03] what he says
[15:04] now Faith what this up here that you're
[15:06] to live by
[15:08] is the substance
[15:12] of things hoped for
[15:14] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[15:17] it the elders obtained a good report
[15:21] through faith we understand that the
[15:23] worlds were framed by the word of God
[15:26] so that things which are seen were not
[15:28] made of things which do appear all right
[15:33] now we want to go over to where we read
[15:35] in habakkuk 2 and verse 4.
[15:39] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[15:42] not upright in him
[15:44] but
[15:45] the just shall live by his
[15:48] Faith you may be seated the Lord that is
[15:52] blessing to the reading of the word
[15:56] now
[15:58] I want to hold a thought
[16:01] I was going to continue on with a point
[16:04] we did get some of it Wednesday but
[16:08] um we were on talking about the
[16:10] substance
[16:11] but this part just came in and I want
[16:14] this to
[16:15] uh fit in I believe in the right place
[16:20] that we're going to talk about you know
[16:22] what is faith
[16:24] and we'll just go from that point
[16:27] and uh you know
[16:29] and tried this past Sunday we were in
[16:32] that on the afternoon service
[16:36] but
[16:37] you know we talk a lot about faith you
[16:40] hear that especially among the Believers
[16:42] of the message because it's one of the
[16:45] things that that we we know for Surety
[16:49] like the prophet said
[16:51] we need
[16:53] a revelation more than anything
[16:57] see because it's only by revelation
[17:01] all right
[17:03] are we anything whatsoever
[17:05] so then what is faith
[17:11] then
[17:12] thinking about it that what we read
[17:16] that it's the substance
[17:21] of things hoped for
[17:25] now
[17:28] so then
[17:32] we go back to one thing what is faith
[17:38] and we know that faith is a revelation
[17:41] all right
[17:43] we'll read these things but
[17:48] if the world came into existence from
[17:51] things that do not appear
[17:53] as we just read you know which means
[17:56] that
[17:57] uh there was no such thing as anything
[17:59] there
[18:00] is that carnal enough for southern
[18:01] language to be there just wasn't
[18:04] anything and and all at once
[18:08] things begin to be created
[18:13] substance begin to come into being
[18:19] within wherever that substance came for
[18:22] from
[18:24] would have to be
[18:25] greater
[18:28] than the substance itself
[18:31] because the substance didn't bring to
[18:34] Faith
[18:37] faith is
[18:39] the substance
[18:42] all right now it's not that it's going
[18:46] to be and we'll read in a little bit
[18:47] that hearing is not faith
[18:52] the
[18:53] but that's what we think
[18:56] we've got it in our mind our concept or
[18:58] our thought about faith and this is this
[19:01] has been bearing with me and you forgive
[19:02] me for just being blunt about talking
[19:05] about it but it's been you know we we
[19:09] spend so much time talking about faith
[19:13] until
[19:15] um I think that most people have in
[19:19] their mind that faith is just oh
[19:24] an ability to believe
[19:27] or it is our believing you know
[19:31] well what do you mean I have faith
[19:35] well the prophet would say well
[19:37] what are you doing in the prayer line
[19:42] see we proved that we don't have the
[19:45] substance
[19:48] but now our problem is that we
[19:53] it's the substance of things hoped for
[19:56] which means that really now listen and I
[20:00] know you see you go one way you go the
[20:02] other and it tricks your mind but if
[20:04] it's the substance of things hoped for
[20:06] then it's actually to you and to
[20:10] everyone else you can't prove it
[20:16] right
[20:18] see if you could prove it it's a
[20:20] scientific fact
[20:22] I mean I don't have to prove this Pulpit
[20:26] exists
[20:27] it's a scientific fact
[20:30] so I'm not trying to have a faith for a
[20:33] poop hit
[20:35] it's already been brought into existence
[20:38] and how did that come into existence
[20:43] well we know in the scripture as we were
[20:45] trying to bring out
[20:46] through faith that
[20:51] the word of God my point today
[20:55] is one thing
[20:56] how sure is the word of God
[21:02] now and my thought is
[21:05] a quote the prophet made one day
[21:08] and that's what I'm trying to get away
[21:09] from just our mental thoughts
[21:13] he said
[21:15] if under the blood of bulls and goats
[21:20] he said flies fleas and frogs come into
[21:23] existence
[21:26] he said why would we stumble
[21:31] at the word of God
[21:35] bringing squirrels and
[21:37] things into existence
[21:40] now
[21:42] I know what most people think about that
[21:45] but I don't think that away it's like
[21:48] one big man in the message passed on now
[21:51] he said that third pull is only for the
[21:55] Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham
[21:59] well that just kind of pulls us out of
[22:01] this picture doesn't it kind of you know
[22:03] kind of drops us back
[22:05] so then you know
[22:08] if that's the way you believe it
[22:11] then you don't have much hope at all
[22:13] let alone a revelation
[22:16] because what would you be hoping for
[22:19] all you would have in that situation if
[22:22] you do not believe that the third pool
[22:25] is for you
[22:27] then you would only be having hope
[22:31] and it wouldn't be hope that is an
[22:33] anchor
[22:34] of the Soul
[22:38] now Abraham talked about hope
[22:41] we'll get back to those things when we
[22:43] get back into the substance part
[22:45] you see Abraham's hope wouldn't I hope
[22:48] you know
[22:49] he wasn't hoping he was going to have a
[22:51] child
[22:53] his Hope was faith
[22:57] well you'll find in in Hebrews
[23:03] that it speaks now look I got one more
[23:05] now but it's 15 times in the book of
[23:08] Hebrews 11 there that it speaks of his
[23:10] you know talks about
[23:12] by faith
[23:14] all right
[23:16] and then there's four times it talks
[23:18] about through faith
[23:22] and remember that what I said
[23:25] and we went back and looked at it that
[23:28] the word faith is only used two times in
[23:30] the Old Testament
[23:33] so we would think it was a great thing
[23:37] and it is
[23:40] because Abraham's hope
[23:43] was a revelation to him
[23:47] all right which was faith
[23:50] it's just a way of expressing it the
[23:52] best best way I can say
[23:55] is because when you bring the word faith
[23:59] into the New Testament understanding
[24:03] you really get something you can anchor
[24:05] into
[24:07] and you can see that as we'll get to it
[24:10] later
[24:11] that those Old Testament Saints
[24:14] they didn't have the new birth
[24:16] they didn't have Christ Living in them
[24:20] they couldn't say the life that they
[24:22] were living was living by his faith
[24:27] and that's why I chose to use a habakkuk
[24:29] the way it is remember
[24:32] and it says the just shall live by his
[24:34] faith
[24:35] all right
[24:37] now
[24:38] his faith
[24:41] can be an Old Testament
[24:44] word of Hope
[24:47] all right
[24:49] but now remember Abraham's Hope was a
[24:51] substance
[24:55] all right now I was trying to get a
[24:57] point across and I don't want you to
[24:59] lose that
[25:00] because to me it's a very vital thing
[25:03] to know the difference between the Old
[25:05] Testament
[25:07] of what their wording is for it and the
[25:10] New Testament of what our wording is for
[25:12] it because we're coming to a positive
[25:16] thing and then your Prophet took it into
[25:20] the greatest height
[25:22] that could ever be
[25:24] in a message called perfect
[25:28] faith
[25:30] now if if you take Faith as being what
[25:34] it is
[25:36] me
[25:37] and you could look back in the Old
[25:39] Testament and see that it was a
[25:41] revelation to them
[25:45] but they were a little hindrance about
[25:48] the things being done and they were only
[25:52] speaking forward
[25:54] but then when you would strike the New
[25:56] Testament
[25:57] it would start talking about faith as a
[26:01] substance form
[26:05] right
[26:06] then as I said your Prophet would title
[26:08] the message
[26:10] perfect faith
[26:14] perfect faith
[26:16] all right
[26:18] why would he be bringing it that way
[26:19] when we'll read it a little bit when he
[26:21] said
[26:22] the disciples didn't have perfect faith
[26:27] is it called they had an epileptic child
[26:29] you know
[26:31] to not be healed
[26:35] if you understand what I mean I'm trying
[26:37] to get a view of the overlay of the
[26:40] Bible as to how that it can speak back
[26:43] here
[26:45] and it can be so positive
[26:48] until to those people it was a substance
[26:52] to them
[26:54] all right
[26:55] but the real substance part had not come
[27:00] into being yet
[27:03] so then they would have to be depending
[27:06] upon
[27:10] the New Testament and is that Hebrews 11
[27:13] 40.
[27:14] a day without us cannot be made perfect
[27:16] all right see then bring it over into
[27:19] the New Testament
[27:22] and picking up Faith
[27:24] and to realize then now you're going
[27:27] higher into the order
[27:30] and uh
[27:32] you're realizing that even though these
[27:35] people with
[27:37] substance
[27:39] substance faith
[27:42] you know
[27:43] okay
[27:44] but yet they're waiting on
[27:46] something
[27:49] right
[27:50] because the people are in the grave
[27:52] today
[27:54] the bride of Christ
[27:56] right
[27:58] Waiting For What
[28:01] somebody to come to a place
[28:04] and that's why I chose to using the
[28:06] wording that he's used
[28:08] coming to a place of perfect
[28:11] faith
[28:14] perfect faith
[28:16] and perfect there being like Matthew 5
[28:20] 48
[28:22] be therefore perfect even as your father
[28:24] in Heaven is perfect
[28:26] all right
[28:27] and that word doesn't mean
[28:31] that you're not right and you're made
[28:33] right
[28:34] you know you're not pure you're made
[28:36] pure
[28:37] we now buy the prophet have the
[28:39] understanding of what does it mean
[28:42] it means it's not a full age yet
[28:46] right because the word perfect
[28:49] is the word complete
[28:53] so then you're not having to change it
[28:56] you're having to come to an
[28:58] understanding of
[29:01] faith
[29:05] and how that you can say
[29:07] they had the faith
[29:10] I know that's been hard seemingly baby
[29:14] for me
[29:16] maybe I've had the trouble to try to
[29:18] explain it
[29:19] but that's what I look at
[29:21] go when you say that the Old Testament
[29:23] people
[29:24] didn't have the new birth you just feel
[29:26] people going
[29:28] um
[29:29] does he mean they ain't saved
[29:32] it's like I always tell you
[29:35] you talk to your neighbor about
[29:38] one God water baptism
[29:44] you know and you're trying to show them
[29:45] and
[29:47] a little bit something strikes and
[29:49] they'll say you mean my Obama wouldn't
[29:52] saved
[29:54] no you ain't mentioned Mama
[29:58] but they've come to a realization
[30:01] that there's a difference
[30:03] in what you're talking about and what
[30:07] they've been believing
[30:09] all right now
[30:12] you see we want to all call what we have
[30:15] as faith
[30:17] revelation
[30:19] right
[30:21] now come on be honest
[30:25] at least for yourself because they're
[30:27] going to help you lie
[30:28] especially to yourself
[30:30] there was a time that you believed the
[30:32] Trinity was right
[30:36] now we may have had different versions I
[30:39] was probably more Oneness than I was
[30:41] Trinity because
[30:43] you know I I just couldn't go along with
[30:45] the trinitarian concept
[30:49] and I would argue with the people about
[30:51] it
[30:52] you know into Baptist
[30:55] and uh well see we we thought we had a
[30:58] revelation
[31:00] right
[31:03] and our Revelation was so great
[31:06] until we would make statements from that
[31:09] to show how great our Revelation is
[31:14] you've heard the one what
[31:16] when I get up to heaven
[31:18] and I come to find out there's not three
[31:20] of them I'll turn around and leave
[31:24] you've heard down
[31:28] and really as I said maybe something you
[31:30] say I was in heaven and I'll walk out
[31:32] well there's only one other place to go
[31:36] but that's none of my business just
[31:39] trying to make a point
[31:41] I try to speak to you to make you think
[31:43] about what I'm saying
[31:47] all right
[31:49] but have you ever had it down pat
[31:53] I remember who was it somebody years ago
[31:56] might have been brother Schrader I'm not
[31:58] certain but uh my brother said
[32:04] said I had it down pat
[32:06] that a man was saved by works
[32:10] he said I had all the scriptures because
[32:12] I said I'd read these things about
[32:15] you know the works and the things
[32:19] when he said one day I got a book and
[32:22] said it said we're saved by faith
[32:25] and said this man laid down a
[32:29] great lineup Through the Bible that it
[32:31] was not works
[32:32] it was saved by faith
[32:34] he said I wound up being massively
[32:37] confused
[32:40] well
[32:43] have you ever had a what you thought was
[32:45] a revelation
[32:48] amen
[32:50] you know
[32:53] have you ever had the Lord told me
[32:59] ever heard people say that
[33:03] well then when it don't come to pass who
[33:06] are you going to blame
[33:09] you know
[33:12] and evidently wasn't a lord or it'll
[33:14] come to pass
[33:16] right
[33:18] right but my point is
[33:21] and what have I been getting on
[33:23] have you ever had a revelation
[33:28] have you ever had a substance faith
[33:34] something that no matter what anybody
[33:37] would say
[33:40] they can't talk you out of it
[33:43] very few people's ever had that
[33:46] really just how something
[33:49] the Lord spoke to me
[33:52] well like I said
[33:55] I've never heard any preachers outside
[33:59] the message inside the message beside
[34:01] the message over the match anywhere I
[34:03] really never heard any preacher say that
[34:06] it was a devil telling him to bring that
[34:08] sermon that day
[34:10] have you
[34:12] I've heard a lot of false doctrines
[34:14] all the way down through time
[34:17] and every one of them was a revelation
[34:22] well
[34:25] we're in the time of where it used to be
[34:27] especially
[34:29] that
[34:30] they had the dates and the times and
[34:32] Seasons your older ones in the message
[34:34] remember that
[34:36] you know I mean they had this
[34:40] and if it don't happen here
[34:43] then you know what
[34:46] you know what great Revelations
[34:50] like I told you that man called me that
[34:52] time and said what do you think about
[34:54] this Resurrection on Good Friday I said
[34:58] praise the Lord
[35:00] he said sound like you don't believe it
[35:03] I said well
[35:05] I didn't know it
[35:07] it's not been made known to me you know
[35:09] it's coming this Good Friday he said
[35:12] well they do have it figured out and if
[35:14] it don't come by Good Friday today's
[35:17] about 30 40 days later I said now sound
[35:20] like you don't believe it
[35:26] see if you've got a revelation you don't
[35:29] have to prop it up
[35:31] right
[35:33] you don't have to make excuses for it
[35:35] not happening
[35:36] you know for sure what it's going to be
[35:41] all right
[35:42] now
[35:45] if the Bible's right
[35:49] you say well you're something that's
[35:51] your question that's not mine
[35:55] he says now Faith
[35:58] is
[36:01] that is his present tense right now
[36:05] and thee is singular
[36:08] like John D Baptist
[36:11] so they wouldn't but one be Baptist so
[36:14] that put the Baptist out and that's what
[36:16] I told them then you know they'd say
[36:18] we're the we're Baptist called John with
[36:20] Baptist I said well first off he was
[36:23] under the law second off there's only
[36:25] one of them
[36:27] that the singular
[36:30] but if we believe the Bible that faith
[36:32] is
[36:35] the substance
[36:39] all right
[36:41] substances what do you think consists of
[36:43] whether it be natural or spiritual
[36:46] all right
[36:47] and it's a substance of things hoped for
[36:53] now that word hoped
[36:56] is not based in
[36:59] you can show it
[37:03] because there's a hope all right
[37:07] now Abraham had within him
[37:13] the ability to bring the child
[37:18] right
[37:19] he had the makings of things
[37:24] but yet he needed some help
[37:27] to be able to bring a substance
[37:33] so he had to get somebody to help him
[37:37] and that was Sarah
[37:39] and he tried it with Hagar
[37:42] right
[37:44] he got his substance
[37:46] when he got a wild man
[37:49] right
[37:51] well that was his revelation
[37:55] amen now
[37:56] can I use the words of the Prophet when
[37:58] he said it starts in the doubt
[38:01] is that the way he said it he said the
[38:03] promise started with a doubt
[38:05] now
[38:07] we know Sarah doubted
[38:11] but Abraham evidently had a little
[38:13] problem
[38:15] he had a little bit of a doubt
[38:20] of course getting him a new wife was a
[38:22] good thing you know he probably liked
[38:25] that
[38:27] but yet there was a problem about that
[38:30] being God's promise
[38:34] do you understand what I mean
[38:36] you understand what I mean that
[38:39] Abraham had a hope
[38:42] that was a revelation
[38:46] right
[38:48] I mean you heard right around him how
[38:50] many times
[38:52] you know
[38:53] Sarah wrote anything different nope
[38:55] praise God we're gonna get it anyway
[38:57] he had a revelation
[39:01] one day
[39:06] I don't like to use it because I don't
[39:08] have any words if I could have found it
[39:09] I would have used brother Branham to say
[39:10] it so I'll just say it myself to let you
[39:13] do what you want to
[39:14] one day he began to have a little
[39:18] problem about the substance
[39:22] yet within him he still had the
[39:25] revelation
[39:27] and that Revelation now we're going to
[39:29] get to this
[39:34] if that Revelation come from God
[39:36] it didn't matter what Abraham done
[39:42] God was the one made the promise
[39:45] you remember
[39:47] Abraham give his wife away
[39:54] now we're just talking planes
[39:58] I mean if I'm off the message come and
[40:00] tell me
[40:01] but he would just
[40:03] Abraham begin to let
[40:06] Sarah's Doctrine
[40:08] to him
[40:11] in Hagar
[40:14] will bring the child
[40:16] well you know to start with Abraham
[40:18] didn't know who's going to have the baby
[40:19] right am I right
[40:23] God didn't tell them to start with Cyrus
[40:25] gonna have the baby
[40:27] he just told him he's going to have a
[40:28] baby
[40:31] right
[40:34] all right
[40:35] it took quite a while before God laid it
[40:37] down and said
[40:40] Sarah
[40:41] all right from here to there Abraham had
[40:45] the revelation
[40:50] that he was going to have a child
[40:53] right
[40:56] now
[40:57] problems in between
[41:00] because that was the promise God made
[41:05] problems in between begin to deal a
[41:08] little bit with Abraham and his thinking
[41:12] and you remember the prophet in the ways
[41:15] brought it out in the way we do with the
[41:16] scriptures that
[41:18] Abram was the father of
[41:21] Ishmael
[41:24] and Abraham was the father of Isaac
[41:28] and that's why it says take thy son
[41:31] thine only son
[41:36] see so God didn't count
[41:38] all of Abraham's problems
[41:41] and his doubtings and frustrations
[41:47] because he made the promise
[41:49] he got you to start with who is going to
[41:52] have the baby
[41:53] right
[41:56] but he also knew what was going to
[41:57] happen in between but he had to let
[41:59] Abraham run through all of that
[42:03] and there he was
[42:05] just an ordinary human being
[42:09] that listened to his wife and her
[42:12] revelation
[42:16] because that's what
[42:21] you remember
[42:23] he said well Lord even in the beginning
[42:27] the Lord let uh what was his name uh
[42:30] Abraham's servant
[42:32] let him
[42:34] be the heir
[42:35] you know let him carry on
[42:39] and he said no it's going to come from
[42:41] your lineage
[42:44] well he had that right
[42:46] so get what I'm talking about now
[42:49] I'm trying to explain the difference
[42:52] between the Old Testament thinking of
[42:55] people
[42:57] and the New Testament thinking that you
[42:59] and I should have
[43:03] there shouldn't be any question
[43:06] in the New Testament
[43:10] I'm trying to get you to see a
[43:12] difference between one and the other
[43:15] uh
[43:18] I goofed up and didn't bring my notes
[43:22] I'm laying there this morning packed up
[43:24] everything didn't bring them and I can
[43:27] see now why because I wouldn't be going
[43:28] according to him anyway
[43:32] but
[43:34] maybe that's the reason okay
[43:38] so here's Abram
[43:40] the father of Ishmael
[43:45] but Abraham is the father of Isaac
[43:51] so he said thine son that only son
[43:55] God had no recognition in his plan of
[44:00] Ishmael
[44:01] being of anything
[44:06] Abraham had he stayed with it correctly
[44:09] or Abram
[44:12] he would have held on to what God Said
[44:14] and said I'll wait
[44:17] but as the prophet said about
[44:20] Sarah he taught the church which brings
[44:23] it down to where we are
[44:25] and he said
[44:27] Sarah couldn't wait
[44:30] he said just like Eve couldn't wait
[44:37] and he said the church can't wait
[44:41] you remember shot in time God's worst
[44:43] enemies
[44:45] man look how long we've been here
[44:48] 40 something years since the prophet's
[44:50] gone you got types and shatters we went
[44:54] around horrible all along we it's about
[44:56] time to cross over you know
[44:59] well
[45:01] anybody want to start a victory march
[45:04] you know we'll try to get over
[45:07] but
[45:08] I think that what we need to do is just
[45:11] keep moving in the word of what it's
[45:14] really supposed to be
[45:16] all right
[45:17] so then
[45:19] Abram
[45:22] is the one that listened to Sarah
[45:27] right
[45:30] Abraham is the example of a true
[45:37] person with a revelation
[45:43] right
[45:45] so Abraham he said it's tigered knot
[45:49] the promise of God through unbelief
[45:53] but we're strong in faith
[46:01] in other words
[46:02] Abraham
[46:05] didn't consider what Abram done
[46:13] Abram listened to Sarah
[46:16] Abraham never listened to her
[46:20] okay
[46:22] coming over
[46:24] greater revelation
[46:28] Sarah had the revelation
[46:30] hey garkin
[46:32] the polygamist legal and it was
[46:33] everything was fine
[46:35] and and I'm honest and I'm just plain I
[46:38] don't understand why Abraham hadn't
[46:41] already had 10 or 15 wives
[46:46] it was legal in that time
[46:53] but he didn't choose to
[46:57] it took the woman
[47:00] they get him messed up
[47:03] right he was pretty good doing in
[47:05] staying with just one wife
[47:10] but by the revelation of Hagar I mean if
[47:14] Sarah
[47:16] Hagar comes into view
[47:18] and polygamy and Abraham comes into view
[47:22] right
[47:24] join the weakness of Abram
[47:29] he takes a wife
[47:31] hoping
[47:35] hoping that uh
[47:38] he could fulfill the promise of God
[47:41] don't you think so
[47:43] don't you think he considered that
[47:45] Yes Man
[47:47] are you listening
[47:49] you know we come down to a lot of
[47:51] infinitarian doctrines and a lot of them
[47:53] know holy I mean no uh
[47:56] no Eternal health and
[47:58] we come through a lot of more doctrines
[48:00] didn't we
[48:01] that we thought
[48:04] was the word of God
[48:06] and we swore by and we spent hours
[48:10] proving our revelation
[48:17] when it went to revelation
[48:21] it was a mental concept
[48:25] of a human mind to trying to move into a
[48:28] supernatural understanding
[48:31] right right
[48:33] do you understand what
[48:35] I'm talking about Abram
[48:39] but when it comes over to Abraham it
[48:41] says it didn't say Abram never staggered
[48:44] at the promises of God
[48:47] he said Abraham didn't
[48:51] because you see God made the promise and
[48:54] God knew who was going to have the baby
[48:57] he never made the promise was
[49:00] Hagar
[49:04] that's messed it up
[49:06] you know you got a lot of them things in
[49:08] the Bible it's hard to understand
[49:09] you know that brother Branham said that
[49:11] when Moses smote that rock the second
[49:14] time and I still don't fully understand
[49:16] this maybe you do and somebody might be
[49:19] able to help me
[49:21] but I fully don't understand why the
[49:23] prophet would make the statement yet I
[49:25] believe it
[49:26] and he said when Moses smoked a rock
[49:28] that second time he said it broke every
[49:31] scripture in the Bible
[49:34] every time
[49:39] what's your Prophet said
[49:42] well
[49:46] but there'd be no excuse today
[49:50] to how a Moses
[49:52] to Smite the rock the second time
[49:58] you know what I'm saying now in the New
[50:00] Testament it's always supposed to come
[50:02] up closer in the word substance
[50:06] if y'all to wait all the way because I'm
[50:08] having trouble
[50:12] watching them going to the funeral
[50:15] but are you listening
[50:19] is it
[50:20] there's no excuse today to have an
[50:22] Abraham Abram
[50:28] it don't matter what all this people
[50:30] tell you about
[50:31] marriage and divorce about the things
[50:34] the prophet said
[50:36] Daniel 70 weeks he said now polygamy is
[50:39] wrong
[50:40] and he said you don't need
[50:43] to use the word revelation or for God to
[50:45] speak to you something like that
[50:48] he said you don't need a revelation to
[50:49] realize that polygamy is wrong today
[50:55] which you know a lot of people still got
[50:57] that revelation
[51:00] right
[51:01] it's all right it's
[51:03] the going thing
[51:05] you go back in your two Soul people a
[51:08] lot of you don't realize it and and you
[51:10] did it at her and play around with the
[51:11] thoughts are too so when you was in
[51:13] those two Souls the very first thing
[51:15] they started out with was polygamy
[51:18] and the man proved it by getting a bunch
[51:20] of girls taking off Florida with them
[51:25] but
[51:28] I'm trying to express
[51:30] why would it be that you've got an Old
[51:33] Testament people
[51:36] and it would say
[51:37] by faith
[51:41] but then when you come to the bride of
[51:43] Christ
[51:45] and the example of the bride of Christ
[51:47] is over in the uh 12th 13th verse or
[51:51] somewhere in there
[51:53] we're
[51:56] true Faith Sarah conceived
[51:59] through is something you're in travel
[52:03] by is something present
[52:09] you see we have no excuse
[52:11] for
[52:13] wrong doctrines
[52:18] we're not supposed to be under the
[52:20] Abrams
[52:23] are the Moses
[52:29] we're not supposed to be under that
[52:32] we're supposed to be under the form of
[52:34] faith
[52:36] that is the substance
[52:42] and there should be no doubt
[52:45] whatsoever
[52:50] if there's any doubt after all of this
[52:52] garbage about run around and being wrong
[52:55] about a date run around and being wrong
[52:56] about this right around being wrong
[52:58] about if that's hindered your Revelation
[53:01] you never had one to start with
[53:05] amen
[53:07] amen right right yeah can I be that
[53:09] blood
[53:10] you never had one to start with you had
[53:13] a mental concept
[53:16] you had an Abram concept
[53:22] and you had a Moses that
[53:24] God said you didn't sanctify me you're
[53:28] saying divide yourself so now you better
[53:30] go back find out what he's talking about
[53:32] Sanctified me and set aside
[53:35] he said Moses you didn't set me aside
[53:37] you set yourself aside coach he said
[53:40] must we fix you water from The Rock
[53:44] see look at me my revelation
[53:48] and he could turn around later
[53:51] he'd say
[53:53] well I got the water didn't I
[53:57] and you know what he did
[54:00] but you know what broke the scriptures
[54:03] right
[54:07] my whole point
[54:09] we can talk about faith and what it is
[54:13] but can we go back to it's a substance
[54:20] it's in Abraham
[54:22] he had that revelation
[54:26] he was going to have a child
[54:30] right
[54:31] he got his wife's Doctrine mixed up in
[54:35] what he thought was
[54:37] his Doctrine her word
[54:39] but just remember now I'm going to say
[54:41] this because it'll help for later you
[54:43] remember it wasn't Abraham's Doctrine
[54:50] I'm going to say something don't be
[54:52] you're going to swallow so swallow and
[54:53] get it ready
[54:56] so you and I don't have no Doctrine
[55:03] you ever notice a prophet making this
[55:04] statement no law but love no Creed but
[55:07] Christ no book with the Bible
[55:10] and you go down and you tell somebody
[55:12] that and you hand them a card and you
[55:15] say here's a Spoken Word Church card
[55:17] said read on the back of it they turn it
[55:19] over and they read so
[55:21] no law but love no creeper Christ no
[55:23] book but the Bible why are you giving me
[55:25] these books
[55:27] you know
[55:30] well
[55:31] you got an answer
[55:34] come on they never put that in your face
[55:37] you're out giving out books you said you
[55:40] don't have books
[55:42] well if this and this is not the same
[55:46] all right
[55:48] if this message is not
[55:51] this Bible if this Bible is not this
[55:53] message then you got two books you're
[55:57] dealing with a lot of things that you've
[55:58] got trouble with
[56:00] but when you can anchor it down and say
[56:04] we're not stupid we know brother random
[56:06] made mistakes because he was a human
[56:08] being
[56:09] we know he said things and all that was
[56:12] human
[56:13] but so did all the prophets
[56:16] have problems
[56:18] and flaws right
[56:21] but that didn't stop anything you
[56:23] explain how that Elisha could curse him
[56:25] she by I'm gonna curse him children
[56:28] and ain't the Holy Ghost
[56:33] what are you trying to get to
[56:37] I'm trying to get to a point that
[56:40] you and I are not going to walk off this
[56:42] Earth
[56:43] now you better listen
[56:45] we're not going to walk off this Earth
[56:47] in a change upon the revelation
[56:50] that Abraham had
[56:58] we're not going to walk off this Earth
[57:00] in a Rapture with the Revelation that
[57:03] Paul had or other disciples
[57:09] so we better be trying to find a perfect
[57:14] faith
[57:21] a perfect revelation
[57:27] but a human with arrows right talks
[57:32] that's what I've always said
[57:34] the message is right
[57:36] messenger may have troubles because of
[57:38] the human being
[57:39] but be careful what you say his troubles
[57:42] are
[57:43] because I still try to have his his uh
[57:46] guesses than mine in your revelation
[57:50] you know
[57:52] I mean when he said and when he said at
[57:55] that time he said I used to think that
[57:56] that God hated me and Jesus loved me now
[57:59] remember he never did believe in two
[58:01] gods
[58:02] he had no concept of two Gods he's a
[58:05] prophet
[58:06] and now what's he saying
[58:10] he's saying I didn't see it right
[58:14] right
[58:16] he wasn't making it to people
[58:21] simply saying I don't understand
[58:25] but it said when I've seen them with the
[58:27] same person there's this revelation
[58:38] would require perfect revelation
[58:42] perfect faith
[58:46] all right
[58:48] so now if the world's waiting on
[58:51] you and I
[58:55] mean we better find a revelation he
[58:58] can't be tampered with
[59:03] right and we better get away from the
[59:04] sissified things of well I don't know
[59:07] like a brother I said the preached the
[59:10] sermon here that time oh he was really
[59:12] on fire
[59:14] and he read one quote
[59:17] he read the quote the either it not here
[59:19] he read it that wrote around and said if
[59:22] I'm off on one point then I'm off on
[59:25] everything
[59:27] you know he made that statement
[59:30] and said see like
[59:32] he's wrong about the dates out there so
[59:37] out of the message he comes
[59:41] well they didn't have a revelation
[59:44] you know how good common sense
[59:46] a little Revelation I'd be glad to tell
[59:48] him that
[59:50] because it's truth
[59:53] when you see what do you have have you
[59:56] ever had something that is yours
[1:00:04] something nobody can't argue about
[1:00:07] they can't talk you out of it they can't
[1:00:09] quote you out of it
[1:00:12] but you remember
[1:00:16] there's a lot of people can't be talked
[1:00:19] of out of their Doctrine
[1:00:22] that is not a substance
[1:00:25] you want to go to the pope of Rome until
[1:00:27] it there ain't three gods
[1:00:31] come on you get what I mean
[1:00:34] we could have it all figured out
[1:00:38] and worse than any denominations ever
[1:00:41] been
[1:00:45] what about it
[1:00:49] what kind of substance do you have
[1:00:52] well now brother Dale you sound like
[1:00:54] you're talking about maybe one of these
[1:00:56] days getting to a place that we can just
[1:00:57] speak the word I'm glad you thought of
[1:00:59] that
[1:01:01] because I thought that's what the
[1:01:02] prophet said
[1:01:07] when I said well ago the man said
[1:01:10] big following still have even though
[1:01:12] he's passed on
[1:01:13] he said that third Fool's only for
[1:01:15] brother random and Jesus
[1:01:22] I just happened to know where the quotes
[1:01:24] at where he said
[1:01:26] that the third pool was farther bright
[1:01:30] Church
[1:01:33] into the totally lost
[1:01:37] I just don't see how the church can have
[1:01:40] anything to do with the third pool you
[1:01:42] don't even know what it is that's right
[1:01:48] you believe that
[1:01:51] you don't know what it is
[1:01:58] see that's
[1:02:00] that's where we get into the wrong
[1:02:02] things with our thinking
[1:02:04] and it won't fit the word but yet we
[1:02:05] have this great revelation
[1:02:07] but
[1:02:09] I want to get into a thought but I said
[1:02:11] I'd do it so brother Joe would you pull
[1:02:13] up brother Anderson one we'll have the
[1:02:16] one for wisdom versus faith that brother
[1:02:17] Cauley showed me uh Wednesday night I
[1:02:20] guess it was
[1:02:22] and I said well hey he's reading
[1:02:24] I just hope all of you read
[1:02:27] I'd like for all of you to come and say
[1:02:28] look what I found
[1:02:29] I love the hat it don't bother me look
[1:02:32] what I found brother Daniel look what
[1:02:34] the prophet said
[1:02:35] that's what I want you to do
[1:02:40] see then that way at least we can talk
[1:02:42] about the same thing
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:46] well look what he says wisdom versus
[1:02:49] Faith paragraph 7 uh 479
[1:02:53] then if Jesus defeated Satan upon the
[1:02:56] faith
[1:02:57] and what
[1:02:59] was the faith he taught knowing who he
[1:03:02] was
[1:03:04] he was a predestinated creature are you
[1:03:06] ready
[1:03:08] or can y'all say it okay all right
[1:03:12] what about the predestinated Bride of
[1:03:15] Jesus Christ
[1:03:18] now you believe the bride is
[1:03:19] predestinated amen
[1:03:21] the predestined native bride of Christ
[1:03:23] now the church
[1:03:28] the word seed
[1:03:31] with everything that God promised to put
[1:03:33] in the church
[1:03:38] in it right now
[1:03:42] it's in it now
[1:03:44] everything is in order
[1:03:46] the Holy Spirit has been given the seed
[1:03:50] has been sown the evening lights has
[1:03:53] been shining the sign of Sodom
[1:03:57] that Jesus Promised is here and Malachi
[1:04:01] 4
[1:04:02] a predestinated church
[1:04:08] he ain't talking about Odell he's on but
[1:04:10] oh your devil
[1:04:11] you might as well go on forget it
[1:04:14] because somebody's already got the seed
[1:04:16] song you know that we're in a day of a
[1:04:19] lot of marvelous things
[1:04:22] but once a woman gets pregnant at least
[1:04:24] they're not dealing with that anymore
[1:04:26] to try to get her pregnant again
[1:04:29] you know what I mean
[1:04:32] you understand I know I'm carnal but
[1:04:34] that's just making a point a woman is
[1:04:36] pregnant she don't get pregnant no more
[1:04:38] until the baby's born
[1:04:40] right
[1:04:42] well because she's pregnant why because
[1:04:45] the wounds closed
[1:04:48] when if our wound is not closed
[1:04:51] up to showing us what all this garbage
[1:04:54] can around the world is the message
[1:04:57] people then you ain't pregnant
[1:05:00] you're still having your periods
[1:05:03] do you understand that one I guess
[1:05:07] you're still in your problems
[1:05:11] but he says the bride
[1:05:14] has the scene seat sown into her
[1:05:17] what is the seed of God this word
[1:05:21] what is the word of God
[1:05:24] letters on a page
[1:05:29] Paul said to let her killeth
[1:05:34] this message
[1:05:36] the letter killeth
[1:05:41] the prophet said even while it's laying
[1:05:43] on the pages of this book
[1:05:45] I didn't give them that one but
[1:05:54] taken through there is a man here they
[1:05:56] can turn on lights paragraph 74. so life
[1:05:59] is only by the word of God made manifest
[1:06:01] life comes only by the word of God made
[1:06:04] manifest as long as it's just in the
[1:06:07] book
[1:06:09] like this
[1:06:10] it still can be questioned
[1:06:16] but when it's made manifest
[1:06:20] then you see the product of what it
[1:06:22] spoke of being materialized
[1:06:26] then that is light on on the word
[1:06:33] Lord is laying in the pages of the book
[1:06:35] it can be questioned right now we agree
[1:06:38] there so then let me hold up the
[1:06:40] messages if you agree as long as it's
[1:06:42] laying on the pages of these
[1:06:45] tapes and books
[1:06:47] of the prophet
[1:06:52] it can be questioned
[1:06:56] that's right now you agreed with it was
[1:06:58] the longest thing on the pages of the
[1:07:00] Bible
[1:07:01] but now if you surely don't agree with
[1:07:02] it being on the pages of the prophet's
[1:07:04] message then you are
[1:07:07] you need a mental transplant
[1:07:10] because I'd certainly say this first
[1:07:12] before I'd say this but I'm certainly
[1:07:14] not going to say neither one I'm going
[1:07:16] to say what the Bible says the letter
[1:07:18] killeth with the spirit giveth life
[1:07:22] this message
[1:07:23] is letters on a page right whether you
[1:07:26] hear it on a tape
[1:07:28] or whatever
[1:07:30] his letters on the page
[1:07:32] you can take the Bible
[1:07:35] and I'm wondering why somebody hasn't
[1:07:37] done that
[1:07:38] you could take the Bible and virtually
[1:07:41] almost have brother Branham
[1:07:44] reading every scripture on one tape
[1:07:48] you understand me yeah
[1:07:50] you don't have to go to Xander buns or
[1:07:53] this out of the other to get them to
[1:07:54] read it you can do it but would that be
[1:07:57] life
[1:08:00] your computers now are made we can do it
[1:08:03] right here
[1:08:04] I can take the quote we just done
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:08] let brother random read that to you
[1:08:11] would that help you
[1:08:14] you know
[1:08:15] that's the only reason I haven't went
[1:08:16] with it they're done told me it's
[1:08:18] available
[1:08:20] because you can go in your computer
[1:08:21] right now and be read the book and right
[1:08:25] around them will read it to you right
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:28] does that make it more real no
[1:08:32] well now brother Dale what it is like
[1:08:34] one man said said you got to know his
[1:08:36] actions you got to know his moves and
[1:08:40] his things
[1:08:42] that's all right
[1:08:45] that's okay that's fine with me I don't
[1:08:48] have no problem with it with the moves
[1:08:50] and the actions not to revelation
[1:08:54] all right so now let's get to where
[1:08:56] we're going with the message a little
[1:08:58] bit
[1:09:00] I'll continue the rest of it Wednesday
[1:09:01] Cardinal problem
[1:09:03] I didn't settle that a long time ago
[1:09:08] I know for a certainty
[1:09:11] that if I have a part to do with this
[1:09:13] then I don't have to worry about passing
[1:09:15] on till I get my part done and then when
[1:09:17] I get my part done I want to pass on
[1:09:19] that's right and I want to be
[1:09:21] you know you're gonna have to pull me up
[1:09:24] okay
[1:09:25] look at what the prophet says we've read
[1:09:27] this over and over but we really do we
[1:09:29] read it
[1:09:31] go ahead with quote number one brother
[1:09:32] Anderson which is taken from the rapture
[1:09:36] progress 65.
[1:09:38] now what is faith
[1:09:43] we've explained I think
[1:09:46] at least I tried to
[1:09:48] that there's an Old Testament form of
[1:09:51] faith
[1:09:53] which is to them was a substance
[1:09:59] but they couldn't bring that substance
[1:10:01] into being
[1:10:05] it took the god that made the promise
[1:10:09] to bring it to pass
[1:10:12] we're in the New Testament form where we
[1:10:14] should move up
[1:10:16] to instead of just being by faith
[1:10:19] this is an example we can say through
[1:10:21] faith
[1:10:23] through the study of the word of God in
[1:10:26] the message we've come to this place
[1:10:30] that now it's perfect faith
[1:10:33] brother Dale do you have perfect faith
[1:10:36] on some things
[1:10:40] no problem saying that you think that's
[1:10:43] exalted what's yours
[1:10:46] I got that much you got that much what's
[1:10:48] the difference in what we got
[1:10:51] come on if you ain't if you ain't
[1:10:53] capable of saying that you have perfect
[1:10:55] Faith then you need to be an all to
[1:10:57] prayer for the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:10:58] what we're going to read right here
[1:11:01] whatever you have if it's been revealed
[1:11:03] to you
[1:11:04] his perfect faith
[1:11:13] but around him is so straight until if
[1:11:15] you'll keep reading you'll find it
[1:11:20] Those Old Testament signs those apostles
[1:11:25] they didn't have perfect faith
[1:11:33] he hadn't died yet
[1:11:37] a little woman at the whale
[1:11:39] he said well what do them people have
[1:11:41] back there they had a revelation
[1:11:46] are you saying there ain't no salvation
[1:11:49] in the old I just see them people doing
[1:11:50] that out there on the internet
[1:11:52] and he heard me preach you mean to say
[1:11:54] you don't believe them people saved
[1:11:57] you dummy go back and listen for a while
[1:11:59] and you'll hear me saying and explain it
[1:12:05] they had a faith
[1:12:07] and I'll give you the quote in just a
[1:12:08] second for the time
[1:12:16] but the disciples did not perfect faith
[1:12:18] when I epileptic child was there in
[1:12:20] front of them
[1:12:21] and the prophet explains why they didn't
[1:12:23] he said because they had Jesus with them
[1:12:28] he said it's hard to have perfect faith
[1:12:31] without the Holy Ghost
[1:12:33] because the Holy Ghost frames it
[1:12:39] okay
[1:12:40] so we need to read don't we
[1:12:43] look to the church divide the Rapture is
[1:12:45] a revelation to her
[1:12:47] it's revealed to her
[1:12:50] that the Revelation the true bride of
[1:12:52] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:12:54] revelation of the rapture
[1:12:55] so whatever you have wonderful hold on
[1:12:58] to it
[1:12:59] but someday
[1:13:01] there's going to be something happen
[1:13:05] it's going to be based upon what we
[1:13:06] already have
[1:13:08] that he can reveal it to us
[1:13:13] National revelation
[1:13:16] brother Revelation is faith
[1:13:19] and watch you cannot have a revelation
[1:13:22] without it being faith
[1:13:25] faith is a revelation
[1:13:28] because it's something that's revealed
[1:13:31] to you
[1:13:33] faith is revelation faith is something
[1:13:36] that has been revealed to you
[1:13:39] like it was to Abraham
[1:13:44] that could call anything contrary to
[1:13:48] what had been revealed to him
[1:13:51] and though it wasn't so
[1:13:57] now Faith that's what faith is
[1:13:59] is the revelation of God
[1:14:01] the church is built
[1:14:04] upon the revelation
[1:14:06] the whole entire body
[1:14:08] now
[1:14:12] like it was to Abraham that could call
[1:14:14] anything contrary to what had been
[1:14:16] revealed to him
[1:14:18] when he got that baby by Hagar
[1:14:22] he humanly was thinking maybe that would
[1:14:25] be the thing
[1:14:28] but it never stopped his revelation
[1:14:30] because irregardless of who he got it
[1:14:33] from
[1:14:34] he knew he was going to have a child
[1:14:38] because God had done told him
[1:14:41] when are we going to get down to
[1:14:42] believing it like that
[1:14:47] when are we going to Anchor into
[1:14:50] believing it let's get a couple of
[1:14:51] quotes
[1:14:52] look at the next one
[1:14:54] the power of God Chicago Illinois
[1:14:57] 1965. excuse me 1955 1006.
[1:15:03] what is it Revelation what is faith
[1:15:07] and that's the title of the subtitle
[1:15:09] part of what we use
[1:15:11] remember we're still on positive
[1:15:12] attitude
[1:15:14] this is message number nine positive
[1:15:15] attitude
[1:15:17] we put a subtitle what is faith
[1:15:19] what is faith
[1:15:21] now here's a prophet going to explain
[1:15:23] what faith is
[1:15:30] God
[1:15:32] what did he say is God by the spirit
[1:15:35] revealing to you something that he's
[1:15:37] going to do
[1:15:39] or he's promised
[1:15:48] something he's going to do
[1:15:54] go ahead doubt all you want to you ain't
[1:15:56] going to change the word of God
[1:15:58] he's done said it that's it
[1:16:01] doubt all you want to
[1:16:03] see if you're unbelief will stop the Sun
[1:16:05] from coming up in the morning
[1:16:09] but I'll remind you of a man that had a
[1:16:11] faith that stopped it all right sir
[1:16:18] it wasn't unbelief that stopped it
[1:16:21] go ahead sit out there in the morning
[1:16:23] say you know you ain't coming up son
[1:16:26] watch
[1:16:28] now if you only hear
[1:16:32] Faith coming by hearing
[1:16:35] the hearing is not faith
[1:16:41] you remember the others with a loaf of
[1:16:43] bread and what we're talking about a
[1:16:44] loaf of bread is purchased by 25 cents
[1:16:48] but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread
[1:16:54] yeah but only mother quotes where the
[1:16:55] Prophet said I'm as good as God is right
[1:16:57] he's got it go to his faith
[1:17:00] but he's just showing us the 25 cents is
[1:17:02] the purchase and Power
[1:17:05] it's not the loaf of bread
[1:17:08] but 25 cents is not a loaf of bread see
[1:17:12] hearing does hearing only brings the
[1:17:15] word that produces faith
[1:17:19] man
[1:17:23] I'd write that down that's to me I love
[1:17:26] that
[1:17:29] hearing only brings the word that
[1:17:31] produces faith
[1:17:33] but faith is the substance of things so
[1:17:35] far the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:17:38] and you see you hear the word
[1:17:41] God reveals it to you
[1:17:43] that it is the truth and by Spirit
[1:17:46] reveal truth confirms your faith to God
[1:17:50] it says you get it
[1:17:55] what about it
[1:18:03] let's get one more then real quick I'll
[1:18:05] review these but go ahead to the next
[1:18:07] Patmos Vision you've been through this
[1:18:09] when you've heard it many times Well I
[1:18:11] love it I love them all
[1:18:15] I sit down sometimes and I think
[1:18:18] sometimes like to take that I don't know
[1:18:21] what you call that index book
[1:18:23] you know it's the listen of all the
[1:18:24] tapes
[1:18:26] you know sometimes I just like to sit
[1:18:27] down and read
[1:18:31] you know just read the title
[1:18:34] you'll never do that get your book one
[1:18:36] of those index books and just read it
[1:18:40] like I've told you before
[1:18:42] after 65.
[1:18:45] let me skip Matthew 63. after the
[1:18:47] opening of the seals
[1:18:49] just sit down and read it
[1:18:52] Christ is a Mr God really who is this
[1:18:55] male chastity marriage and divorce
[1:18:57] things it ought to be
[1:19:01] every one of those messages gone into an
[1:19:04] eternity
[1:19:05] why did he have to preach Christ mystery
[1:19:07] of God revealed over again
[1:19:08] we need to always preached it
[1:19:11] because it went into a higher order amen
[1:19:15] well look
[1:19:18] ask God while we're talking on
[1:19:19] Revelation
[1:19:21] asked him to give you a revelation of
[1:19:23] this
[1:19:25] for it can only be known by revelation
[1:19:29] remember laying on the pages of the book
[1:19:31] laying on the pages of the message can
[1:19:34] be questioned
[1:19:38] if you don't want to be known by
[1:19:39] revelation
[1:19:41] and you can only be saved by revelation
[1:19:45] you remember the man that told right
[1:19:46] around him and said we don't accept no
[1:19:48] Revelation he said then God can't say
[1:19:50] can't get to you
[1:19:53] so you can't be saved without a
[1:19:55] revelation
[1:19:58] come on
[1:20:02] I wish I could stop right there and
[1:20:05] preach about two hours
[1:20:06] on what is a new birth
[1:20:12] what is a new birth I shouted I spoke in
[1:20:14] tongues I cried I'd done this the
[1:20:15] devil's got you beat
[1:20:17] what is the new birth
[1:20:20] Jesus Christ and we're quoting right
[1:20:22] around him
[1:20:24] personally reveal to you
[1:20:31] you what is a new birth the birth of the
[1:20:33] word amen that's why the Bible says
[1:20:36] being born again what is this statue of
[1:20:40] perfect man Brother Dean was talking
[1:20:42] about this morning
[1:20:43] being born again
[1:20:49] through faith
[1:20:52] are you listening
[1:20:55] look what he said he can only be known
[1:20:57] by Revelation you can only be saved by
[1:20:59] Revelation you have a knowledge of it
[1:21:02] intellectually
[1:21:04] but you can't be saved until it's
[1:21:07] revealed to you
[1:21:09] but now brother Dale that was back in
[1:21:11] 60.
[1:21:12] I only take what's after 63.
[1:21:16] well the one we read up there about
[1:21:19] Faith being the substance
[1:21:21] and the one we read yeah it was in 65.
[1:21:26] good
[1:21:27] you can't be saved until it's revealed
[1:21:29] to you nobody can call Jesus of Christ
[1:21:31] only by the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:21:33] that's what the Bible says no man can
[1:21:35] say Jesus is the Christ until he has
[1:21:38] received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:40] dude not enough
[1:21:43] he might say the Pastor said so the
[1:21:45] Bible says so then we're truths the
[1:21:47] church says so that is true
[1:21:50] but you don't know yourself until the
[1:21:52] Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and
[1:21:55] he's becoming you
[1:21:59] now you're not going to get a revelation
[1:22:02] if it's a revelation of God
[1:22:04] it is not in your human brain
[1:22:12] we just read
[1:22:14] intellectually
[1:22:16] there is no such thing as a new birth of
[1:22:19] the brain I agree that we need one
[1:22:27] still won't work
[1:22:31] and he's becoming you
[1:22:34] no man could call Jesus Christ only by
[1:22:36] the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by
[1:22:39] intellectual
[1:22:41] all right
[1:22:43] so what is faith
[1:22:46] Paul said it's the substance right
[1:22:52] right now if we believe that
[1:22:56] the word of God created all things do we
[1:22:59] believe that
[1:23:00] you remember the old colored Brotherhood
[1:23:03] and I'd rather be standing on the word
[1:23:05] and standing in heaven
[1:23:08] he's a coach Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:23:11] away
[1:23:12] but said his word won't pass away
[1:23:15] that man had a revelation
[1:23:19] he said I believe it from Kimber to
[1:23:22] killer said I don't even believe what's
[1:23:23] on The Giver
[1:23:24] yeah
[1:23:27] it's called Holy Bible
[1:23:29] you remember the man said what would a
[1:23:31] Mose or something I said Moses what if
[1:23:33] the Bible said jump through the wall he
[1:23:34] said I just jump
[1:23:37] he said because if he said it he's got
[1:23:40] to provide the home
[1:23:48] but let me review a second
[1:23:54] Old Testament people
[1:23:57] had a revelation
[1:24:02] but it was not
[1:24:04] by a born-again experience
[1:24:07] because it had not been given
[1:24:10] but it was Revelation he said brother
[1:24:12] Dale was it just mental no
[1:24:18] Abraham got the baby
[1:24:20] pretty good substance right
[1:24:23] right
[1:24:27] you see they had a substance
[1:24:30] a revelation
[1:24:33] the little woman that touched his
[1:24:35] garments brother random said perfect
[1:24:37] Faith since she had faith for the time
[1:24:39] perfect Faith I'll get this Wednesday he
[1:24:43] said those disciples did not have
[1:24:44] perfect Faith he said God it's hard to
[1:24:46] have perfect faith without the Holy
[1:24:48] Ghost he said go to Holy Ghost brings it
[1:24:51] that's right
[1:24:55] well let me restate what I started with
[1:25:00] the prophet said
[1:25:02] he may not under the blood of bulls and
[1:25:04] goats
[1:25:06] under their form of faith revelation
[1:25:13] they could speak flies fleas and frogs
[1:25:16] right he said why would you stumble
[1:25:19] at the blood of Jesus Christ speaking
[1:25:21] squirrel
[1:25:23] but if you're going to take the point
[1:25:24] that it's only for the third pool is
[1:25:27] only far brother random and the Lord
[1:25:29] Jesus and we don't have anything you
[1:25:31] know then don't worry about the rest of
[1:25:33] what I'm saying
[1:25:36] I thought the third pool was for the
[1:25:38] bride
[1:25:40] and a church
[1:25:42] well you look today and you go right
[1:25:44] over here
[1:25:45] and there could be somebody healed right
[1:25:48] there today
[1:25:49] there could be somebody saved right
[1:25:51] there today amen
[1:25:55] amen yeah but you don't understand what
[1:25:56] third pool is
[1:26:01] I thought the prophet said
[1:26:04] a quote
[1:26:05] that it was the revealing of his word
[1:26:11] so you want to talk about all the things
[1:26:14] that would go physically around that
[1:26:18] but it don't matter what physically goes
[1:26:20] on around that you're going to come back
[1:26:22] at one time
[1:26:24] it's a revealing of his word amen amen
[1:26:32] amen see because faith is the substance
[1:26:36] this world was created by the word of
[1:26:38] God we just read
[1:26:41] come from
[1:26:43] something that didn't exist
[1:26:48] oh I know how smart we are
[1:26:52] I know we know how to quote
[1:26:59] you know what to quote did you run into
[1:27:01] a lot of people's mind right now so let
[1:27:03] me quote it to you
[1:27:07] them seed it was created
[1:27:10] trees and I
[1:27:12] said could have come from some other
[1:27:13] civilization
[1:27:15] remember that quote
[1:27:19] I believe it
[1:27:22] I believe it 100 that it came from
[1:27:25] another civilization
[1:27:28] now your interpretation of civilization
[1:27:31] is vastly different than mine
[1:27:37] because you see I don't believe God was
[1:27:40] a blob
[1:27:42] no form is floating around why don't you
[1:27:46] just go with the energy Theory
[1:27:48] you know they can't be created or
[1:27:50] destroyed just go with that on energy
[1:27:53] he had one of them in one of the
[1:27:56] series you don't know something
[1:27:59] you remember the guy that great big old
[1:28:01] guy he had a brain
[1:28:04] come on kids you have to help me in a
[1:28:06] brain down here he was the brain to the
[1:28:08] whole thing it wasn't even up here
[1:28:10] everybody to call the brain
[1:28:13] we try to look for some other
[1:28:15] civilization
[1:28:19] it's been taught in organized religion I
[1:28:21] deal with more people created than Adam
[1:28:23] and Eve
[1:28:27] red
[1:28:28] foreign
[1:28:30] I like the Bible
[1:28:34] now what's your answer
[1:28:36] somebody says that more people was
[1:28:38] created than Adam and Eve what's your
[1:28:40] answer
[1:28:41] give me a scripture for it
[1:28:46] my Bible says Eve is the mother of all
[1:28:50] living
[1:28:52] if there's any monkeys in outer space
[1:28:54] they come from here
[1:29:00] extra rational beings don't believe in
[1:29:01] them
[1:29:04] travel to the Moon sure do
[1:29:08] but what are you getting that brother
[1:29:09] Dale
[1:29:12] substance
[1:29:14] the word of God is the substance
[1:29:20] remember Faith Revelation is the
[1:29:23] substance
[1:29:27] he existed before any substance that we
[1:29:32] think of he was real
[1:29:37] there wasn't another civilization before
[1:29:39] this that's right God existed we're in
[1:29:43] heaven whatever you want to call it he
[1:29:45] created angels and they worshiped him
[1:29:48] how long did that take before it was
[1:29:51] transmitted to Earth
[1:29:56] the seed that's in the Earth come from
[1:29:57] another civilization
[1:30:01] let thy be
[1:30:03] ready he didn't have to transmit it from
[1:30:05] here to there
[1:30:07] or gather it over here and plant it over
[1:30:10] there he spoke it
[1:30:15] and it became material
[1:30:18] faith is a substance
[1:30:21] and what are you getting at come on
[1:30:22] brothers
[1:30:25] I'm getting to the basis of one thing
[1:30:29] you may come as Brother Dean was ending
[1:30:31] up this morning talking about
[1:30:33] it would be at the Merced elements
[1:30:36] you may have to speak the next meal into
[1:30:38] existence
[1:30:47] did the prophet say
[1:30:49] that we had enough faith in us to create
[1:30:51] a world and go live on it
[1:30:57] did he talk of limbs being restored yeah
[1:31:00] but that was only in him
[1:31:02] see are you back with the doctrine it's
[1:31:04] a third bullet only for him
[1:31:07] in the Lord Jesus
[1:31:13] and I believe the third pool is for the
[1:31:15] Bride of Jesus Christ and even those
[1:31:18] people right over there
[1:31:20] the church
[1:31:22] can use it and see the effects of it
[1:31:27] but they don't understand what's going
[1:31:28] on
[1:31:29] because it's not fully for them
[1:31:32] but if you don't get nothing out of the
[1:31:34] message today I hope you get one thing
[1:31:35] Those Old Testament people had a faith
[1:31:38] but I was not a different faith when it
[1:31:41] come into the new but the New Testament
[1:31:43] Faith come by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:45] being shed to let the life come back and
[1:31:48] live in the soul
[1:31:51] or in the Old Testament the Revelation
[1:31:53] was not in their head
[1:31:56] it was in their soul
[1:31:59] their being
[1:32:04] and they believed it
[1:32:07] why would we be concerned about it
[1:32:10] the next meal we have maybe spoken into
[1:32:13] existence
[1:32:16] he said well I don't know about that
[1:32:18] well I can tell you what happened here
[1:32:20] one time and we had a fellowship meeting
[1:32:23] and we didn't have enough food
[1:32:27] some of you witnessed that
[1:32:30] we didn't have enough food
[1:32:33] I said said it before him there will be
[1:32:36] enough food
[1:32:38] we took up food after they left
[1:32:43] well I don't know well see that's I
[1:32:46] can't
[1:32:47] see if you've never experienced it
[1:32:53] if you never tasted of a watermelon I
[1:32:56] can't tell you what it tastes like
[1:33:01] right
[1:33:03] but if you ever get a taste
[1:33:07] if you ever tasted of a God that's real
[1:33:12] that you can talk to
[1:33:16] and even talk back to you
[1:33:25] but be careful how you talk back
[1:33:26] remember the boy I told you at work
[1:33:29] did I was talking to him about water
[1:33:31] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:32] Christ
[1:33:33] he said told me he said God spoke to me
[1:33:36] in an audible voice
[1:33:37] I'm going to argue with him
[1:33:40] I believe him
[1:33:41] because see The Honorable voice said
[1:33:46] you go get baptized in the name of the
[1:33:47] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:53] so he came to me and he said
[1:33:56] finally one day and he said I got
[1:33:57] baptized this weekend
[1:34:00] he said young blood which was a Baptist
[1:34:02] preacher
[1:34:04] so he baptized me both ways
[1:34:08] I said before you say another word
[1:34:11] I'm going to tell you how you was
[1:34:13] baptized
[1:34:16] I said you was baptized in the name of
[1:34:18] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:20] and then you was baptized in Father Son
[1:34:23] and Holy Ghost
[1:34:27] he said yes
[1:34:29] I said you erased your baptism
[1:34:32] and God spoke to you audibly
[1:34:36] that's your business
[1:34:38] but I said had you been in question
[1:34:41] about it
[1:34:43] if you'd had questions and baptized
[1:34:45] father son Holy Ghost and then baptize
[1:34:47] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:34:49] wouldn't have said nothing
[1:34:51] because you're a human being with a
[1:34:52] question
[1:34:53] but I said you erased your baptism
[1:34:58] you see go tell that man that God didn't
[1:35:00] speak to him
[1:35:05] what about your revelation
[1:35:07] stand what do we got
[1:35:10] what kind of Revelation do we have
[1:35:15] is it a substance
[1:35:19] I have no problem
[1:35:22] would anybody bring in me this Bible
[1:35:27] and want to know where I got it
[1:35:30] I enjoy it
[1:35:33] explaining it out of this
[1:35:40] God here is the only anchor I got
[1:35:46] if this Prophet was to speak contrary to
[1:35:50] this word it would have not been the
[1:35:53] prophet of Malachi 4 a sensible
[1:35:56] but when you get them together
[1:36:00] I don't have to line them up doc shots
[1:36:03] of a rifle
[1:36:06] I know
[1:36:07] he told me
[1:36:10] where God could speak to me
[1:36:14] but Faith cometh by hearing hearing is
[1:36:19] my faith
[1:36:24] look at Paul have you received the Holy
[1:36:28] Ghost
[1:36:29] since you believe
[1:36:34] I think that ought to be asked about the
[1:36:36] people of the message have you received
[1:36:38] the Holy Ghost since coming in this
[1:36:40] message
[1:36:41] what do you mean brother Dale this
[1:36:43] message is the Holy Ghost
[1:36:47] the word of God is the Holy Ghost with
[1:36:49] the letters on the page is not the Holy
[1:36:51] Ghost
[1:36:53] whether it be Bible whether it be
[1:36:55] brother Brown's message letters on a
[1:36:58] page
[1:37:01] be questioned
[1:37:04] have you ever had a revelation
[1:37:12] something to come to you I tried to
[1:37:15] explain it Sunday
[1:37:17] we want to make it some great big
[1:37:19] something some white bang coming out of
[1:37:21] the sky some trumpet sound
[1:37:25] when it's just simple
[1:37:29] it just comes
[1:37:31] as a knowledge
[1:37:37] a knowledge to you
[1:37:41] they can't be questions
[1:37:48] the knowledge
[1:37:50] yeah
[1:37:52] check it with this
[1:37:57] check it with this
[1:38:03] he said I believe
[1:38:05] that we have thee what'd he say
[1:38:09] Divine interpretation
[1:38:13] and perfect Vindication is that the
[1:38:15] wording something like that I believe
[1:38:17] this message
[1:38:19] has been Vindicated
[1:38:23] I believe the man that read this message
[1:38:25] to us love to read out of the King James
[1:38:28] version
[1:38:30] even though that was written by 60
[1:38:33] something different men
[1:38:34] and it's not even based upon any one
[1:38:38] coming with an authority to say God told
[1:38:42] me this
[1:38:45] it's based upon an interpretation of all
[1:38:51] the written words that they had
[1:38:55] you understand oh brother that I talked
[1:38:59] to King James with the Holy Bible yeah
[1:39:01] you thought they had it when Peter James
[1:39:03] and him was here didn't you
[1:39:07] come out 16-11.
[1:39:12] I see
[1:39:13] we got a great revelation
[1:39:17] whether will it fit the word of God
[1:39:21] will it hold
[1:39:23] it when things start going wrong
[1:39:28] when they ask you to do not what are you
[1:39:30] going to do
[1:39:36] I don't like you to be so doomsday I'm
[1:39:39] not Doomsday foreign
[1:39:45] take no fear what shall be said when
[1:39:48] that hour arise because he said he would
[1:39:51] give us what to say
[1:39:54] that's Christian
[1:39:58] what about it
[1:39:59] anybody ever need the orders open
[1:40:02] just think about it
[1:40:04] pray for a revelation
[1:40:06] more than anything
