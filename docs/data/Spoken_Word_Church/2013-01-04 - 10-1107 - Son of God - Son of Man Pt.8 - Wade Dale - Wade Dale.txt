========================================

Revelations 3 14. background what we're doing is uh uh we are showing the Son of God to the son of man we've been on it for quite a while how this person that was so great that nobody could comprehend is now become a man that where we could comprehend and feel and touch him the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we went to Isaiah 53 and showed what this man's purpose was his body was the sacrifice just like a lamb was in the Old Testament but his soul was the very soul of God so that Soul could come back on the believer the animal blood could not come back I want a believer that way or this one this one there you go it really doesn't matter okay that's good Revelation 3 14 is where we're at this man this person this God that came down on Earth and died um to release his life um there was many lives released in the Old Testament as far as animals and but that animal blood could do you no good because it didn't come back into the animal resurrect the animal and say like Jesus said all power and Heaven Earth been given unto me there was one man who did that that's not a man he resurrected on Easter morning right the Son of God come back picked up that body and then he was then complete almighty God you say oh wait and he was well there was things he didn't know remember his dad's been preaching that he didn't know when he was returning there was he limited himself by the brain matter that he came into the human right the humanity that he came into he limited himself to where he didn't know all things right but now when he come out of that grave he said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me he didn't need somebody to teach him anything he didn't need somebody to tell him anything he was done finished the body was now made Eternal that Eternal Body will be our Eternal sacrifice we'll always see the nail scars what do you mean the all in all then it'll be the all in all the only problem is that he wasn't the all in all right then because we were still inside of him right that's what we're getting to now all right don't get ahead of me don't start preaching I was asking but yeah I know that's true but when he resurrected he couldn't say all in all he said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me we were still inside of that man and and had to be released and so we ascended up to heaven correct then what did he do the prophet said 11 days later or ten days later 11 days later he sent back what he sent back his Spirit the Holy Spirit right to come into the hearts of the Believers and now here we are at Revelation 3 14 and to the angel of Churchill in the sins right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now God is not a creation he's a Creator right but brother Branham said only in Christ is God a creation and if you'll remember as we've been speaking before for some that haven't been here a lot all this is not done for God to develop something different all this is not done for God to say well now I'm no he always was all this that God done was to make his children be able to understand him so every step that he takes is for us to understand him not for him to say well now I'm a son now I'm a father right no he was the all-in-all before the foundation the world because we were back there with him shouting for joy and all those things but we were inside of him in that eternal life we were not in bodies running around like little people all right but he had attributes he wanted us out of him started with Adam started with Eve and then when he done what she done that closed the womb up and he we couldn't be born that way so we had to be born through mom and dad two have our tests and trials on Earth here but he didn't leave us there remembers Genesis uh 3 15. he explains what he's going to do in other words you can't do it now I'm gonna do it that's what he's done it's it's I'm gonna come down and show you that I am all these great things you're the one that's going to have to understand me but I want you to understand me it's not an arrogance to where he said well bless God you got to know right God said you got to understand me because you're my children right right now when we come to John 1 in the beginning was the word words with God and Word was God that was your word body waiting to be made manifest but because we all had to come by sex by Mom and Dad we had to come this one to this one this one this one this one this one this one this one to get you down here because that's what God saw he saw before the foundation the world that you would accept it so he made a way for you to even get here because remember Adam and Eve when they did what they did that cut off the way right for you to get here brother Brown said even Jesus's body should have come through Eve yeah so everything all every Son of God every daughter of God was going to come right through Adam and Eve but when her wound was closed up and polluted God said that ain't gonna happen anymore right in other words you can't keep yourself just plain language we can't keep ourselves all right let's just be plain Adam and Eve was pure all right more pure than we are all right they had a they they didn't have a carnal mind right but Eve just one word she just let down a little bit and see then the ball got rolling and now here we are with a carnal mind that we have but we must have the mind of Christ that's a requirement and the mind of Christ is that creator that was all back before the foundation of the world and that's what I told you last Sunday for us to be able to understand God he had to bring away for you and I to some way get into our mental faculty because he said we must have the mind of Christ um if we were all to come through Adam or through Eve do you mean that literally or as any type of male and a female child that was in the family of God would they have children no I think we'd all come through Adam and Eve we would have all been born through Adam and Eve I don't believe you there would be no see then you'd have a natural lineage we have one lineage and that's Jesus Christ right right we weren't born again for my mom and daddy we were born again for one person Adam would have spoke he would have produced right it wouldn't have been Adam and Eve spoken produced two other people and they would have brought some no no way absolutely not no that would make grandchildren God's not a grain not a granddaddy yeah but if Adam wants to speak to him she had a man and female and they spoke and had a child that's a grandkid right sorry Sons and Daughters Adam and Eve would have had all of us of course it's a moot point one we've been talking about because it didn't happen all right and it ain't gonna happen what's going to happen now sure both everybody but to prove a point is we're not doing that now God's not speaking to speaking to Jesus that's speaking to the Holy Ghost is speaking us into existence that's exactly what you're talking about that's you can't do that that's not three people you got three people in the godhead then all right but no it's one person we come from one man Jesus Christ one man that's right and the Bible says that your mother is the Bible the word and that's where we all came from that's one that we're all kin folks join heirs even when Jesus Christ come he said he was join air that doesn't mean here and here join air means the same I remember brother Harold Hildebrandt preached out a long time ago when I first come back to church and that really struck when he took his fingers and he said God is Not Jesus didn't want us to be like this he wanted us to be join Ayres means you join together and you're the same Heir as the person that joined with you just like this right here John heirs with Jesus Christ so see that would prove one thing that that Adam and Eve wouldn't had Jesus and Jesus had us that wouldn't be John heirs that'd be lesser right he wanted us to be his brother that's what we read in the scripture the other day he wanted us to call us Brethren he wanted us to be our brother he didn't want to be our our Lord he wanted he sure he's inside this man's our Lord and savior this man's our Lord and savior but he wanted to be a man God always wanted to be a human being how do you know that because remember you got to go back to ABC's God don't change right God does not change his mind his mind was always this right here this is what he had in his mind all right of course now we know this is permissive will down here we'll get into some of that later Ginger's gonna hear it next Sunday so she's she's going to get it for you today oh next Sunday who did it last so when you last yeah you did last okay where's Danny at dang oh you know more than one week you got two I got two weeks to cover thank you for reminding me of that I got two weeks to cover Brother Ray you wanna try one okay okay you got it next Sunday he's got the next I'm doing it this Sunday you're doing it this coming Sunday way come on okay so anyway what was my whole thought of this whole process oh I'm going to be in Oklahoma next weekend that's what it was so Jacob is going to get to hear some on predestination which there is this Bible was predestinated by God stamped sealed and delivered pre-determined means you predetermined something and that's the way it's going to be that's why brother Brown said it was hard to say predestination in a crowd that were that was kind of you know a little bit babies because then in your mind then the first thing you think of you think well I have no choice this is exactly what gun I'm gonna have to do because that's what God song that's not it God being infinite and eternal he saw all this happened but then you got to trigger that predestination you've got to make that predestination happen so you got perfect will of God that all should be saved and you got permissive will of God where there's not everybody going to be saved all right but the perfect will of God knew that he'd only have so many children so if you want to just to be real not be babies but to be real strong Christians yes this thing was stamped and sealed before the foundation of the world and it couldn't happen any other way exactly couldn't happen any other way that's pre-destiny that's Destiny determined before you even get here Jacob have I lost love he's gonna have a hate it now you say well then I don't have a choice that all come about because of the choice he saw you make that's right that's right and that all came about this whole predestinated line of Eternity came into being because of what you he saw you do so who is the come on people God said brother Brown said when God and man meet he says two omnipotence meat ye are Gods the Bible said we're even gods in a lower form even somebody's not even born again has a has a long side of him to rule over something to be look at our look at our society we don't all still live in huts that's right we've developed why man has took something and created even a sinful vow you know like Adolf Hitler he gave us some of the best technology in the world as far as Machinery we still can't touch their Machinery in Germany we just cannot get to their uh we buy a lot of products from them in the poultry industry from Germany because they're so precise and the equipment lasts so long than what we do in America all right but but we're going to get into that a little bit later but let's read this here again because this is the beginning of the creation of God this is when this is when when the the uh upper room we know this is um in the loudest end to the layout of sins but this is showing what he is the beginning of the creation of God this is what God wants to be done in this church age he wants you and I to be a complete Christian down through the other ages they were all Christians they were all knowledgeable in the word of God but somewhere down the line Satan got in and started eroding thrown in father-son Holy Ghost brought in water baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost brought in three Gods brought in things like that God winked at their ignorance but here we come up to the last Church age and this is a requirement that we believe these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness to begin the creation of God who was the beginning of the creation of God Jesus Christ right he was born right the first time yep and everybody understand that he was born right the first time there's no way he could go to Nicodemus any other way and say Nicodemus you were born wrong if he was not born right the first time all right he was born right the first time so he could go to Nicodemus and say now you got to be born again of course in his right in his carnal mind he said I got to go back in my mother's womb again he said no you got to be born from above not from down here from above so this is where the beginning of the creation of God started not in the lab I'm saying Church age but in the first church age because remember God looked at the alpha and he looked at the Omega so the alpha bride and Omega bride are the same all right because even in your Bible turn back to the first Revelations 2 1 says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus personal all right now look at the next one what does number two say look at verse 12. all the other ages they end Angela Church in Sardis angel of church in all these other ages but now come back over to verse 14 and to the Angela Church of the laod of sins that's showing that the the beginning the alpha what God wanted to begin with that's what he wanted but it became eroded Catholic Church got involved the apostles they all were killed or died and and then you brought Catholic dogma in and stuff like that see so it was it was his first church age that built the foundation and we kind of got off of that coming up through here but when God comes back here in this final age he says you got to listen to this person this person of Jesus Christ has got to be back in that age now not saying he wasn't any other ages but he's going to be back in his fullness like he was when he stood up and said all power and Heaven Earth been given unto me for us to get out of here people we gotta stand just like Jesus Christ doing that day and said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me I can eat but I can walk through a wall that's right I can converse with you I am a human I look like a human but this body is eternal I'm standing in the first three dimensions Time Life matter but I am Eternal that's what God wanted right that's what he's calling us to do right now he's calling us to stand just like he stood at the resurrection when he said that because let me tell you something he could conquer death you and I have not been able to conquer death until this age right here that's right that's right so there's no way that irenius Martin even Paul could stand and say all power and heaven and Earth's been given unto me right because there was one power of death that nobody's conquered all the way down through the church ages but God required this man right here to come back Jesus Christ to come back through a prophet that's right to tell you and I that we got to get back that's Friday remember he's turning this what if we don't get back to the faith of the father's people then we're not going to take a body change because they didn't even that uh the faith of the fathers they didn't take a body change right right but Jesus went through all those things and said hey you can live just like me right all power see when he said all that meant all all power was given to him brother Adam said if it was two or three persons in the godhead he said all them other gods are powerless now he said because if you believe the Bible when Jesus said all powered and Heaven there's been given unto men if you believe that's the Eternal Word of God he said somebody lost some power but it wasn't he was just manifested in his fullness right there right but he was not complete without me and you right and we were still inside of him in eternal life in an eternal genetics not a not a seed like see here we go thinking about sex where a germ has to meet an egg no God creates spoken word right right that's because see that's the same thing happened with Eve there was there was no let's just be playing there was no sperm released and no egg release God spoke and it created a germ that started life he created the the egg that created the body and when those two met he just they're right there in the womb of Mary same way that he took Melchizedek when he stepped down into this Dimension he just snapped his fingers and blew it you know he just said hey I need a body what do you do some kind of genetic matter came together some kind of DNA makeup came together to make that body of that man melchized because he ate he spoke he but he still was almighty God right but see then that body went away that couldn't be our joint heir that's what was talking about several Sundays ago see Melchizedek couldn't save your soul now what was inside of milk as it could save your soul right right but Melchizedek himself was the priest right right but that priest wasn't your joint Heir that priest was one coming down to say something to Abraham this man right here was our Joyner our brother I'll give my blood for you Melchizedek couldn't give his blood for Abraham Jesus Christ had to give his blood but that what was inside of melchized it was Jesus Christ because Jesus Jesus looked at him he said before Abraham was I am now that I am is the one that came down yeah blew a little dust together and talked to Abraham and that was the same set of eyes that Jesus was looking through but it was the theophany of God not the body of Melchizedek looking at those priests when Jesus was born no there was a body had to come we and we've talked in Isaiah 53 that body had to be a lamb sacrifice right John didn't say behold the soul of God to take away the sin of the world he said behold the lamb oh God right right lamb had to die lamb was was the sacrifice Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world John was prophesying that that because what has to happen to a lamb lamb has to die Behold the Lamb of God to taste away the sin of the world that lamb had to die that's why John had to wash him in the River Jordan he had to wash the sacrifice just like the sacrifice in the Old Testament okay but now he was the only begotten but right here he wants if there's a beginning the prophet said of the creation of God there must be a continuation of that creation if he's the beginning of the creation of God there must be others to come because if there's a beginning that's the start of something so on the day of Pentecost this man we called Jesus went to heaven he ascended he ascended to Heaven his body can't come back because brother Brown said his body can't be on this sinful earth right until the Millennium when God wipes this thing or when man actually wipes this thing off and God can come down with us it's a position that you that you come to I believe there's a position that you and I come to just like Jesus when he was standing after the resurrection because if we're going to see we which are alive and remain alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those who are asleep for they're going to come up first be called out of the ground their body will be changed and then our body will be changed into what the same body Jesus was standing when he said all power and Heaven on Earth been given unto me because that person whoever that is it don't take but one right can say death now has no more dominion over me amen death has nothing to do with this body that my mom and my daddy brought here right what has happened is is what was inside of you has materialized to the outside right it's like a sponge right it's like a sponge you take a sponge and if there's water inside of a sponge you really can't see it on the outside but you take and squeeze it that's right what happens that water just permeates all to the outside of the sponge now you got a wet sponge and that's what's going to happen with that's why we're that we're going to discuss next time on the Bible study this is and I don't like to say just because just means something smaller but the Holy Ghost you received that your new bar is just an Earnest right it's just a down payment it's just a little speck of what you're going to get or what you're going to be but that little speck is like the water in the ocean right you can say I got the whole ocean in the palm of my hand with one drop because you can take that chemical put it under a microscope and take the billions and billions of gallons out in the ocean put them together and they're the same right but you've only got a little speck of it but you can say then you can say well I am born again and I get all the benefits that God give me that's exactly true but you are the ones got to climb that ladder right there that's right God's not going to push you up that ladder the statue of perfect man you got to climb it you got to climb that ladder you got to go up all right so then it is Justin Ernest because like we were talking about last night it's just to earnest money now you can drive the car or you can you know most of us bought houses you most of us put money down well what is that that's your earnest money but that sure ain't if you put a thousand dollars down and you owe a hundred thousand that's the earnest if that ain't the hundred thousand dollars you still got to make the payment every month you still got to come to church read your Bible I want to do the things that you know Christian's supposed to do but if you complete the deal then you can look back on that thousand dollars and say that was worth a hundred thousand dollars you see what I'm saying so you the Holy Ghost once you look back say you'll not ever look back and say well Blau is a babbling baby and that was worthless no you started as a babbling baby and you worked your way up you started with a thousand dollars you made your payments just like the bank you know gives you the the thing that now he holds the title well see the problem with what we have is there's a squatter that holds our title there's an evil Banker you quit preaching for me he's helping you there's an evil Banker that's holding part of the title right I mean brother Branham said said God took back from Adam took back the title deed but he said there's a squatter there's one in between you and God that you got to deal with even with Boaz and Ruth Boaz had to go ask that near Kinsman if he would do the right first he said forget it don't want it so then Boaz well that was the devil that's the guy that's got a hold of this man right here he holds this title now because remember he disputed on the body of Moses in Jude he want to know where God what God did with it why because he's got dibs on it he's got a tag because God told him said dust you shall eat for the rest of your life well that's what is this is Dutch human dust that's what that serpent serpents don't eat dirt right but that serpent that God cursed he is eating dirt he's been eating dirt since Adam started dying since I mean since uh April died right he's been eating this dirt but somewhere some way something was got to happen and it's got to be something in the word that'll show us that that has been done away with amen somewhere we're going to find it I just know we're gonna find it because Paul could look at it through a glass Darkly he could see it but he couldn't get to it because he said you know I don't see all things but I see Jesus all right he knew as a prophet I believe he could see this end time and in here we had a Prophet come in the end time and he told us somewhere in those books and tapes the prophets that lies Rapture and Faith well to make Rapture and Faith you've got to be changed here right so something's laying in all this that we got to pull out and I don't think it's some kind of secret formula that you have to you know look in the Bible and turn it a certain way and pick out certain letters that's to me that's that's like witchcraft stuff right really that's what it is you know people say wow Jesus hits these names in the Bible that's okay that's fine I mean if he did that because brother around said the new the numerics of the Bible are perfect but I don't think we're gonna find some special tape that's right that brother Brown hid somewhere in a cave that somebody's gonna find it we're gonna that's for lazy people hey if we knew that's what he wants what are we doing here I'm tired I've been working since six o'clock this morning so or seven and I just don't go back home go to bed but no you get up and you strive you work and you work and you work and you're working I'm talking about working for God and ain't talking about working for man but you work for God the best you can and somewhere that we may all have to die but so what we I have to believe that that man that stood and said all power in heaven and earth when he said that people we were still inside of that body because eternal life hadn't been given right nobody had to eternal life outside of Jesus Christ at that time when he said that even the 40 days he walked after the resurrection there's no person could say I have eternal life in my soul so Jesus is the only one that had it and when he said something and I'm inside of him I just have to believe it because 10 days later he said go to Jerusalem and he said in other words you'll get some of this yeah but there was not enough word the word came pure and unadulterated in that first age but it was eat down and eroded in the church ages to where man took their own ideas and their own fellowship and their own ideas of the word of God and they made a denomination and when they did that they died so there's death anyway I don't like anything says death except for me to die to myself and I like that all right but here we come up to this age this is the last age but it says the beginning of the creation of God you'd think it would have said that back in Paul's age right but he said it in the seventh age the beginning of the creation of God we'll let you think about that for a couple weeks amen all right Lord bless you
