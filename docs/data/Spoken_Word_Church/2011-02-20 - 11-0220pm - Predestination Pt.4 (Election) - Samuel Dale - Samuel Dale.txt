all unrighteousness and may we walk in you we love you father and thank you in jesus name amen ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with bless us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated so he must have chosen for his predestination right having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself what to adopt us that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ now let's go over to first peter if we get time to get here we'll try first peter 1 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the stranger scattered throughout pontius galatia cappadocia asia and bethany elect according what now according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied you may be seated the lord has blessing to the reading of the word now we will get to when we have time and get on over into the uh you know the point of how that we were chosen in him and all but i'm trying to stay on this about for knowledge and predestination to uh you know to get to a place to where that we can get a better understanding because to me if you don't approach it by foreknowledge then we've got a problem all right i hope you caught that this morning of what we were trying to bring that election i mean that predestination would be after the foreknowledge and see that's what everybody wants to bring all of it down to some predetermining factor and how can you approach it when you know the the prophet has brought it out so gracious unto us and given us these things and uh you know to where we can understand and i was looking i don't know how many times he made that statement but i think it's about five times uh you see he made it on jesus arose in 1956 uh made the statement predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to destiny he made it there he made it in where i think pentecost fell 1955 um 11 11. he made it on faith of abraham prince in 1956 11 18. he made it on um let's see book of exodus 1956 1006 that was just some that i looked back and i thought well i'll bring those back to you and uh you know remind you that that was what he was saying was that predestination looks you know back to foreknowledge all right and then foreknowledge looks to destiny now see destiny is an appointed set time or position or whatever you want to call it that would be your destiny uh so you will say you know well you was destined to do that you know that means that you you you've done it you know the presbyterians brother dick said they'd say yes you was destined to step off of that step so i might as well go get step off the step and get it done with because you know i'm destined to do that and then we say you know especially a lot of people are doing about you know what well well you'll tell a girl you know me and you're destined to be married you know because you're meaning that you're setting a time getting a situation all right we'll get back to that in a minute but i've always said that i would never answer questions on the internet and i will not today but i gave you something there and i decided well i'd better go ahead and do it but when i'm questioned about where brother branham said it i will be glad to give where he said it and that's what i received i will not give the man's name because he might not want it back of course it's on the internet system but uh he might not want it on all this give his it's from um south africa cape town kingston he said greetings in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ what a privilege for me to be tuned into the message of the hour i follow every teaching of pastor dale and it's good to know a person that knows all the answers okay i told you i know all the answers i know somebody that knows all the answers but watch what he said he said i pray that god may continue to reveal his word unto you i would like to know where to find the quote that cain could be saved he called it your brother well i'll do that because that's in a quote or a point you've made you know a statement you've made and it is in genesis uh four you know six through seven where god tells cain you know you would have been set accepted had you done as your brother done right it's in the scriptures but brother branham i just ran these off and just one little bit i could find a moment ago but we'll read these and then they'll go on over to him and then you know he'll know what brother branham because that's that's not answering questions that's putting to the point to work the question where would it say that and i've always said if you want to know where i say it get something you send me a note and i'll be glad to tell you where i get it at because i get it from the prophet's message if not i'll just tell you it's my idea you know no problem i don't have no trouble with that but off the message all the days of our life preaching 59 6 12. brother brown's explaining cain and he literally says cain said now take it or leave it you know all right because that's what he said there take it or leave it see he wants his own way but god still loved him and he still went after him what did god tell cain you do well you'll do well if you'll just worship like your brother abel abe will come god's way but cain wanted his way see all right now in the mark of the beast preached in 1961-217 brother brennan says talking about the worship and the things and all he said if that's right then cain was right but remember god said to cain worship like your brother and you'll do well but he didn't want to do it right he said you'll do well if you do it all right so above he says now that he went after him now here on the mark of the beast 61 217 uh which is another paragraph e70 of the same message we just quoted when god told abel or told cain said just go over and worship like your brother bring a lamb come down here and worship like your brother says you'll do all right do as your brother does you'd be all right uncertain sound 1961-315 uh he's talking about god told cain said he said go ahead and worship like your brother abel and you'll do well go ahead and do the way he's doing it'll be all right with you but he didn't sin laid at the door three kind of believers 63 11 24 evening service he said god told him he said why don't you worship like your brother and you'll do all right you'll do well if you'll do that but know he know too much about it so he rejected it god's power to transform 1965 911 he's talking about that i want to find this you go i got a scriptures here that's where i'm referring to genesis 4 6 and 7 then that's the scriptures god said to cain why why are your countenance falling why are you all full of temper walking around you just heard a message that upset you said well what are you doing that far why are your countenance fell because i didn't come into your church so why did you do it are you using a thinking man's filter or why didn't why you look like that he said if you'll do well go do like your brother's doing out there i'll receive you and bless you i'll do for you the same thing but he couldn't do it our transformation 1965 1031 the morning service he came knew the perfect will of god he knew the perfect will of god cain knew it why but he refused to do it he proved then to be the serpent's seat when he seen the perfect will of god he refused it he had seen god's ven god vindicate abel's message he know that was the will of god see you understand what he said he know what it was he's seen god vindicate abel's message and what did god say to him and he just he said do the same do worship like your brother and you'll do well but did he he seen the perfect will of god but he wouldn't do it so that was to that brother that was asking i'm always glad if anybody anything i say you know if you want to know where it's at like i said i'll tell you where it's at or i'll tell you that it's my idea because i have no problem doing that you know but if it's what he said i have no problem telling you what the scripture said and what the prophet had to say all right let's get back to what we were talking about now we were talking about this morning that predestination looks back to foreknowledge now i said to my to you this morning my own thinking in our common mind that doesn't seem to be the correct way of doing it because it would look like that you would you would try to put you know for knowledge out this way well you say well that's the way it is but now brother brown said predestination looks back to foreknowledge well that would mean that before he predetermined anything that the foreknowledge would be there amen right i mean that's simple reading in it it would be there to foreknowledge you say that's the mind whatever you want to say about it but it would go back to that right and now these are laying a foundation for something else about ephesians when it gets to where we were chosen in him but now see then get that point that you would have for knowledge before you would have pre predestination or to predetermine right then that way god would be correct in what he's doing and as we've covered this morning from romans dark that you know paul covering it that the thing for him can't say why did you form me this way because he didn't form us wrong he formed us correct even in a fallen condition now you tell me i'm not correct you tell me well i might not be able to find a quote where brother ryan would say every baby is born perfect but now you tell me that ain't right and i'll tell you you sure don't know your bible or your god because all life has to come from god it doesn't matter whether it's prostitutes or whoever has a baby life comes from god it don't matter if they take the egg out of this one the germite or whatever they do with it put it together over here it would still be that that would have to come from god so satan can't create science can't create they can say we can take this and we can find a bone and we can get dna out of that bone and and we can can clone a dinosaur you know well all right but do it without the dna you know do it without saying scraping it off of a bone or a rock or something no they can't do it see why because all life comes from god and god can't create anything imperfect you show me how he could if he created something imperfect he can't judge it for being imperfect so he created it perfect every little baby's perfect not eternal now i didn't say that it's perfect but then it's lame as i said in a hospital room the first thing it hears is the nurses over there saying well that's the full moon and here comes all these blankety blank kids you say well a baby don't hear that well maybe he has some way of knowing something right it knows a lot more than you think probably see if god couldn't create a soul imperfect i'll get to that later all souls ezekiel 18 4 all souls are mine need a soul to ever come into the world they wouldn't soul to god see that's why the satan know how so amen that's right it can't be because you said well yeah you didn't always created angelic being not as a soul we'll get to it one of these days is to saw what in the old testament in bringing it out because you had to wait until jesus christ came right nobody could be in the kingdom in the old testament and wait to the new testament we'll get to those things as we go along but see think about it then us over time put ourselves in the pawn shop you know the story brought around said about being in the pawn shop you don't have to be redeemed well we put ourselves there god didn't put us in the pawn shop we put ourselves in the pawn shop of life we accepted to do the things i'm sure the nature of satan would come upon us and the prophet said that would motivate us sure but down inside of there was a soul that wanted to do right why because it was coming to the world of worship king was just the same as abel see now that's where they argue with you and say now wait just a minute well you show me that if god made cain any different then he made abel he's a respecter of person throw out everything on predestination right amen no and he offered him a change judas had three and a half years of listening to a man teach he had to make up his own mind satan entered into him the scripture says he allowed it to enter i've always told you don't worry about going and sitting down in the room and getting a demon on you unless you want it now brother dale i've been sitting and thinking yeah that's true you can feel spirits and things like that but if you don't want it it ain't going to get on you but if you want it you'll start jiggling with the rest of them right i know it brother dale gets his own ways but i got my own ways explaining it there's one thing about it you can't say i didn't explain it because you see it right even on the internet system but listen see then for knowledge then is what the knowledge of god of what would take place see in a later date time because in his foreknowledge this was back before the world begun you know this was back before there was a world this is back before there was anything molecules atoms or anything because the scripture tells you where that jesus stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so then you got to go on back to there all right then you can see that um job is right when the morning starts saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy and brother brown said when they sing the plan of redemption well you know people are afraid of foreknowledge but you know what they're afraider of than for knowledge what do you think people are more afraid of than our full knowledge are they truly afraid of foreign they're afraid of knowledge because they cannot def have you say they can't divide the difference between the knowledge of god and the knowledge of satan right but they they don't want knowledge because knowledge on one side puff it up right but i thought it was in the statue of a perfect man right it's where i thought it was at listed all right well i now do you understand what i'm saying then that predestination the prophet said looks back to foreknowledge and then foreknowledge could predetermine see because you're coming back through see draw it out on your paper you know right i started about doing that but just look at the lines on your papers this morning where it says that predestination looks back to full and foreknowledge looks to destiny well all right just take that election i mean that for knowledge and bring it over here and then just look right back down your line because everything then that would be going forth and happening would be god's foreknowledge so the thing form can't say why didn't you form it so jude could say that some people are what brute beast made to be destroyed they're human beings you know see a lot of people took things like that and they they went around they say well the african people don't have a soul that's a garbage can no they're human beings just like we are everybody is and we all have the same opportunity if not god is a respecter of person all right now let's get down to what we want to get on this evening if you're following it like that so watch what i'm saying predestination looks back to four knowledge so you've got to move to four knowledge back over here past way back behind the predestination and then he can predestinate it to be because he's already looked through and seen the destiny of everything i don't understand why that couldn't be understood perfectly all right but now let's get one that has got a little different ring to it let's read this one the message ephesians parallels joshua 1960 515 the evening service all right let's read it number one on you know sir now listen to this predestination looks back to foreknowledge okay now watch it i mean election watching he changes from the word predestination and brings it over to election right all right now i'm excuse me i mean election election looks back to four knowledge and predestination looks to destiny i mean i love to read this one because i know what everybody thinks and they they want all these quotes that brother branham says that there was no way that you was a a a wolf turned into a lamb which is no way you as this as you know you know you always was i love to read this so this has got to go into where he's talking about all of the always was if he didn't say i was wrong over on this message back here it must be incorporated to see the whole point right so now watch what he said listen to this predestination looks back to four numbers i mean election election looks back so election looks back to for knowledge so anything you think about how you were elected in him et cetera et cetera or whatever you want to think whatever you think about your predestination being in him all of that whatever you want to think on those things you've got to back up to foreknowledge come on because election looks back to foreknowledge just like predestination looks back to foreknowledge because that's how he does it how did he choose did he choose esau and hate jacob i mean did he choose jacob and haydee saw he could only do that by his foreknowledge because if he done it by his predetermining then he couldn't say that he will that everybody be saved right that's scripture he wouldn't everybody he don't want nobody to perish he wants everybody to be saved so let's read what he has to say listen to this now now listen to this he said predestination looks back to four knowledge i mean election election looks back to four knowledge and predestination looks to destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is and watch then election is gonna have to look back because if it starts where you're at you've got a problem are you listening election looks back all right see now you wouldn't a cuckoo bird before the world right he wasn't nothing before the world that's what your prophet had to say about us he said we were only in him all right now so watch what he says election looks back here here it is i was a cockle bird now that's after i got here and he knew it yeah but he can't condemn me for being something that he makes me he didn't make me a kookaburra i made myself a cuckoo bird i was a cuckoo bird i was born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners i was a cocker bird but all of a sudden i became a wheat grain now how did you become a wheat grain i found out that i always was weak that's all right but remember you started out in life as a cocoa bear so now it became a wheatgrain how did it happen i that what is that election one talking about the grain of wheat god before the foundation of the world elected that cocker burr was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it look back and see that he predestinated it long time ago before knowledge he's seen that i would love him so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him i might become from a cocker bird to a grain of wheat now where am i at i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me to and where am i going that's got you there you are me election the scripture says to make your calling an election sure right well now make it sure you know make sure everything's all right what did we read here in a in peter elect according to the foreknowledge of god huh now everybody that's not talking about everybody that's talking to the church because everybody wasn't elected well now you're taking away no no remember remember election looks back to for knowledge now so then only the true seed is we'll get to it in a minute comes as to be called the elect okay see the rest is there's foolish virgins there's all kind of people to be given eternal life no it's just not just the elect only because brother brown said when a woman takes and lays out a material to make her a dress she cuts it out by pattern she makes her address she don't throw the rest of the material away because it's identically the same material it's just not chosen for that position why is it not chosen for that position i watched my wife make dresses and things years ago and she'd make this she even made me a suit one time you know the sports coat thing you know she would lay that pattern you know lay that down on that that pattern and she'd cut well you know she didn't take the other and just burn it you know she she put it up somewhere and made a quilt out of it because she used to do that you know and she put it together to make something else you could take parts of that and cut it up and make dish rags out of it you know wash clothes in case you don't know what a dish rag is you know washcloths you know and i know overseas they don't use a lot of worst clothes but still that's that piece of material we have over here that you wash yourself with you know you know then you dry off with a towel but see then if we're going to talk about that we're the elect we would have to talk about it on the basis that it would have to be the same as the foreknowledge you know it has to go back because predestination looks back to foreknowledge election looks back for knowledge right all right so we got to get all of it back there in the full knowledge and in that way it's not god choosing he knows our choice but i'd rather they just don't make me trill because i just i hear these brothers preaching about i was insane and i just get so excited brother around did talk about non-seed right you know what nun seed is nothing see the seed is not germanized to life right sensible in it that's non-seed all right but god does everything by foreknowledge his foreknowledge lets him look down and see everything and by seeing everything he knew the choice you would make he knew that jacob would be a shyster to get that birthright right and he'd do anything to get it i mean you think about your brother coming in i've been out you know and then he's just dying you know and back there it wouldn't be like us going off over here in the woods and and and come back about 30 minutes later and her belly's growling we say oh i'm starving to death no he probably been out there for three or four days he might have been out there a week without any food and when he came in he said i'm famous to death you know jacob says poor brother you're dying and i ain't to help you unless you give me one thing unless you give me that birth right he somehow says well i think more of living than i do what i'm going to get now everybody got a portion it was only for those with the birthright would get the double portions etc and things and he saw knew he wasn't giving up everything he was only giving up one little point and he never honored the fact or cherished the fact that he was the oldest he was interested in his own belly no how many preachers are preaching because of money in this message we don't talk about that out there because of money same ways but jacob said i want it but i'll give you the food you give me the birthright he said take it all right but listen folks god knew exactly what esau would do he knew exactly what jacob would do he knew jacob would be a shyster that he'd go up there and connie's brother ernie preaches that about you know how they have two con artists up there and uh jacob and what was the other one's name layman or something like that and they were out there conning each other because one of them would trick the other one they're other trick the other one was they just con artists but jacob didn't care he was a shyster until he got his name changed but you see god knew that he'd want to right i don't see why people can't understand salvation on that form how many times did brother branham say that god knew that you'd want to be saved so he had had it perverted well you're just over on them old doctrines it used to be uh let's see i got it probably at home and brother brown said redemption is the oldest doctrine there is the oldest doctrine in the bible is redemption when the sons of god you know shouted for joy in the plan of redemption so then i like to go back to the old doctrines and let it stay there and if i hadn't made any point on four knowledge out of four sermons now to you let it be known that brother dale believes truly in full knowledge and i believe for knowledge goes before because i proved it with the bible and proved it with the prophet's message that foreknowledge goes before predestination the election even goes before and then that way we can look at it and see and keep it in the correct order got you your choice he knew what you'd want he knew you'd want to hear this message he knew you'd want to drive all over the country to come to lula right right do you know what it would take to contact you because that's all he had to do he did not fall down on the way to damascus and force him to be saved he just knew all he had to do was meet him out there didn't you that old boy was well read and that he was a good man i believe paul was the finest man it could be probably a little hot tempered but you know but he was a good man god knew all he had to do was just meet him wrote if i said it wrong did i say damascus that where he was going see i say that a lot of times people say well you're not in the wrong place we'll put it in the right place don't hold out at me just put it in the right place you know let's work out hard but listen god knew what it would take to contact paul but as we were talking about the other day what about that pope back there that brother branham said the holy ghost tried to come on the man and he rejected it and he went and wrote the decree that it was better to force people to serve god than it was to leave him you know without forcement even to kill him right now god tried to save him so then in case you see that he would offer it to cain i don't believe judas the problem was the fact that i told you the other day peter told he did not even know anything about him at least judas introduced him he introduced him to the pilot them right huh yeah i'm not standing that far to say oh he could be see but you say judas couldn't be saved you say cain couldn't be saved well you you have your right of opinion but what about it will it fit see what if god looks at you like he did like cain hey it might be a problem mike all right trying to get a point across look at the next one i gave you from hearing acting and hearing receiving an act in 1960 um 607. but jacob his twin brothers was he talking about he talked about he's all right but jacob his twin brother by election which was by predestination before knowledge came into the world and was a spiritual man to represent the spiritual people all right so now if the bible is right i say that for your benefit not mine then the bible says gifts and callings are without repentance is that true so if jacob had any kind of a gifts or anything that you're wanting to lean upon a phone remember it would have to come before the foundation of the world for some way and give some callings would be without repentance now here's one thing god can do god can contact you right and give you a choice but remember now you've got to give everybody out some form of one at the same time but if he predestinates a seed then he's not watching you right he's watching the sea now what is the seed of god it's the word of god true god's word is his seed that was the seed disorder went to sow and all the son of man sowing the seed which is the word of god around you and said it was the law that jesus sowed can you say law that jesus sowed you know the law is not what we make it the law is spiritual but we're carnal all right and so what what happened let's just get on over to something okay look at number five on your notes where you can get to the point he said before i close this is the church egg book for page 154 before i close this subject come on i know there's a question in your minds you will want to know if i believe in the doctrine of pre-existence i don't believe in that mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls now i've faced this quote before by people that would say brother branham didn't say he didn't believe in any form of predestinat you know pre-existence i've faced that quote of many people making it you know to say see trying to try say well yeah he didn't believe in the mormon doctrine yeah we said he didn't say that believing pre-exist well i happened to know the mormon doctrine because i had a man to explain it to me where i know it because i needed it and it took him eight hours one day and the mormon doctrine of pre-existence is identical to the two soul doctrines and things and see doctrines of this message the mormon doctrine is and you heard me say it over and over but for the benefit of others that the man explained it to me that everybody was up in heaven with all up there and it come around to a point of trying to be whether or not we you know where we can glorify our father and and a plan was devised for us to come to earth and to live here in human bodies and things because we're souls and we would come to earth and live in human bodies now the problem with their doctrine on one form is it's not right but still in another they literally believed that satan had a plan to save everybody in the world now this is their doctor gnary because the man told me about it if i'm wrong let him come tell me because that's what he told me and he didn't have no reason to lie about it he said that they believed that satan come up with a plan which was the anointed churro you know come up with a plan to save everybody so jesus come up with a plan to save just some people and said then by doing that then that there was a big war in heaven and lucifer got thrown out because of his wrong doctrine well it looked like lucifer had a better doctrine than jesus but that's their doctrine all right now if that's the doctrine of pre-existence of souls then any other doctrine of pre-existence of souls would have to fit in the same category because you're talking about souls okay everybody understand you're talking about souls right so they've got the doctrine of the souls where the others would fit in the same category no brother dale we didn't believe we wanted to we didn't believe saying we didn't want it but now but you're still talking about the soul i've seen them draw it out put little dots you have to to try to prove their points and do all the things but listen to what brother brown said you see didn't believe in and i don't believe in the mormon doctrine and pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls now the reason i can tie it together and say it's all on the soul because when you say transmigration transmigration means to go from one body to another body transmigration so he didn't believe in it coming from one body to be another body okay so that would mean throughout the whole thing all right but listen be careful here and see this it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decree jacob have a love but he said whatever hey he carries it back to the next and he said it's a thought all right now so it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally is to see the word all right but now every person in the world comes predestinated by foreknowledge you agree yeah god knows what everybody will do so we knew your choice you would make then as i was saying the other day then the prophet said he don't predestinate according to his desires because he desired that everybody be saved and went down and give you that back or give it on another message number six on your nose but you know what he predestinates according to your desires amen that's why people don't like foreign because foreign knowledge shows that we have the wrong desires right you know if that's what we had right this is the way i desire do you see what happened with cain came the bible and people have argued what he said there you know that cain's uh abel's offering was more excellent than cain so they said cain's offering was excellent why was it excellent when it was the fruit of the ground which was speaking of works it couldn't be see so it's not that away he's speaking and telling you that it was a good offering but it wasn't according to the revealed word all right see then why didn't god accept cain's offering but it wasn't right cain gets upset right and what does he say i read it twice a minute ago what did he say he said lord you take it or leave it in other words i'm not going to do anything else but around him i quote it till he read it to you he said he know he'd heard the message he knew the message from abel was correct because god vindicated it and he says you take it or leave it i'm not doing anything else i tied it down to god's foreknowledge didn't it so how did god elect how did he elect jacob going down reading in the quotes you got there in front of you he said he elected because jacob was seed why because jacob wanted that birth right he wanted that birth right more than anything in the world he wouldn't accurately been four days hungry he wanted that birthright and god looks down and says that being a type of the baptism of the holy ghost because that's what he wanted he's willing to give up everything to get him are we willing to give up everything to get to baptism in the holy ghost are we right now brother dale uh let's don't put it on some kind of doings now what if he asked you he asked a man one time to prove to him that he loved him to take his son up and kill him is that true murder in abraham we know we didn't do it but we know god had to stop him because he was flatly intended to do it now brother branham i thank god he put this quote in one time he said you know god does things one time for an example and said then he don't necessarily have to do it again so i'm glad he didn't put it in there to take that then we have to take her kids out and kill him we may think sometimes we'd like to but still that's beside the point you know just give them a good spanking and take care of the rest of it but predestination looks back to foreknowledge now we see election and you're elected by what did we read there elect before knowledge first peter one and two elect according to the foreknowledge of god but it goes on to show you and we'll get back to those things a little bit better true sanctification of the spirit something's gonna take place now god didn't just elect you brother dick to leave you in a presbyterian church right he knew you'd get up and leave when it come down to the situation you wanted to stay right but i wanted to stay where i was heading come on no problem but he got up and he left and god knew that all right now if the bible is right on the basis that it says he gives the holy ghost to those who obey him no then whether or not you can receive the holy ghost is not based upon whether or not you can obey him well brother i thought it was a free gift and he just throw it down in the world and just as i said about paul he slapped him off that horse he had her donkey or whatever he was writing but he didn't make him say it get saved god can't override your free moral agency that's the one thing he won't do see he knows what we'll do so that's why it says true sanctification of the spirit that means a journey that you're going to have to take brother colley it's not something just strode out that's why brother branham i gave it to you right now we reread it this morning where brother around and said its predestination is not god putting you in a tube and pushing you out the other side no he knew what we'd choose choose you this day whom he'll serve joshua's head as far as me and my house we'll serve the lord make your calling an election sure right make it according to your desired i like this one i just happened to see it you know when i was running through some things on it look what he says on number six on your notes which is super sign in 1963 11 29 but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great for not direct knowledge he is for knowledge by or far by his foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his foreknowledge god doesn't predestinate by his desires he's not willing that any should perish but by his foreign knowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he could make everything work according to his big clock time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning now look right on down to the next one micah the prophet 61 brother random is praying or this is what he says i pray here stands abraham's seed the elected church coming out wanting to be ready to come to el shaddai to draw the strength from god for the change body to change body to receive the son when he comes i pray that you'll grant it lord to them tonight every one of them give them the desire of their heart forgive the sinner bring the backslider back take all the doubt out of the believer's heart make this a great hour give them lord desire for their heart now brother branham in preaching salvation in the scripture that said jonah 2 and 9 i think it is it says salvation of the lord and brother around said you don't have anything to do with it because you didn't choose him he chose you but you do have to accept it if you don't accept it it's not a pardon true so then he wouldn't give it to you if he didn't believe he was going to accept it and he did that quote back there maybe that's for a reason to where we can understand it right for us to go to hell we got to go over the cross amen that's right you've got to reject the word of god to be able to go to hangover because god made every way in the world look what he's done to you and i bring us into this message the greatest message i don't mean grace ever been because that's just every message of god all the way through the time has been the greatest of all but to come down here at the end of all times and he chose you to be here well we will get to it one of these days brother gary that maybe it is to the point that paul couldn't take it in this day right that's fine sure because he's not here that's right oh my you said now wait just a minute you know like i've always said in the army what they do they had a hard-headed nut bunch of nuts and they put them in there and put them in one group and i got a hard-headed nutted old sergeant and they put him in there and he just frails the daylights out of them till he whips them into it but when it comes to fighting on the battlefield they want to call the number one troops in they don't send the bars that wash the dishes right right they call in the guys that are tough well that's what i said that's what god done here he put this old tough nut sergeant over you to beat you with the message until you'd either believe it or get out and we don't want to run nobody off we'd like to run everybody in but we realized that everybody's not going to be able to take it good luck sister gayle says about it but the devil will make you think you're going to have to think about what is said because you're going to have to consider you know what it is so then your great election that you talk about brother brother god elected me why well i'm so pretty i just didn't do like everybody else done now god never elected according to how beautiful you looked nor how good any of us was brother brown says it was trophies of his grace that he chose uh what it chose abraham and he lied he chose this one he chose that and you know and every one of them had flaws but you know what they turned out to be jewels in his crown america what did they say back years ago send us your rejected right that's what that old great big hand sticking up means well they just sent us to me still that's the point you can get over here we'll help you we'll feed you all right but you see brother they'll always send me your people that you don't want you know i'll beat them into being jewels you know because i believe in all of us proving what we are and i believe that's what god's looking at no it's just great revelation brother dale well i think that's the greatest of all revelation that i've ever seen is that god would by his foreknowledge looked down through time and determined that he would not end this thing with the apostle paul standing here that he would not end it with luther or wesley or martin that brother ryan said saint martin was the greatest since the apostle paul he wouldn't end it in their day it just then didn't haphazardly happen to fall in this day there's a seed or word for ever age your prophet said and there's a people to make that seed live and that's what god predestinates eternally but before knowledge he can predestinate everything and then the thing for him can't say you didn't choose me you chose everybody else you know right you know we used to get upset in school when they we'd line up to play ball you know and we'd have to choose teams right and what you do you choose the best you could get you take a good one i'll take a good one after a while you just throw the lump sum of the rest of men but you know what i've seen the lump sum of these things when all of the greatest couldn't hit a ball they couldn't get on they couldn't make a run for nothing and i've seen some of them you think why did they put that kid in you know and see him walk out there and hit a ball and win the game they used to be it used to be two brothers that played with uh matthew i believe it was or it was zach the two brothers it was crippled one of them was crippled a little bit the other one's crippled almost totally just you know and he hit a ball with one hand but you know one day he hit a ball and you know everybody on the field was tickled to death it was worth more than all the others could do well maybe that's what god's going to do with me and you you're just going to take what little chunk he's got hanging around lula and he'll he'll try to make a little bride out of them let's stand together come on brothers he'll try to make a jewel out of us and we'll hit a home run and maybe carry somebody through you know it'll be a great time when we get over there and we look back and see that you know he did save me because i wanted to be saved he didn't save me because he wanted me to be saved because he had to save everybody but he saved me because i wanted to be saved he predestinated me to a situation that i'd have to travel through because his foreknowledge let him know so then he could elect before it ever started he could elect your election he could do that he could choose by his four knowledge his election would bring to pay is what we are need of what do we got 24 spiral book 24 in aspire book anybody have a need think on these things i care about god predetermined by your desires god's four dollars and there he looked down and he saw diabetes so let's just believe there's more in here today do you pray because that's not god's will he wants us all to be healed all right in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we bring our brother before you and you said for us to come boldly before the throne and then you look down through time and you've seen this your day that we would be standing here in the very second the time that our brother would walk out the desire to be healed you said it was settled in our seat because we made up our mind and we just come up to be prayed for to agree they have somebody to help us do we believe it's a mini product we call it to be done in the name of jesus christ because the little bride of christ calls for it sheltering what this is a bad hour and a bad time anybody else oh father in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we ask you to just be with him and lord take care of all his problems and that all thanks be well for your honor because we believe you in jesus name um in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we ask you to be with our sister you make workouts anybody else i'm living my brain but we can believe by faith now in jesus name gently in jesus name we lay our hands upon our god over foreign oh father that lord jesus then you would drop down into her heart and give your desires until everything will work out anybody is are you believing we'll just keep believing let's just take a little time and praise the lord what is that you were saying a while ago i just want to take a little bit of time before we go all right foreign foreign one more time oh oh oh glory glory one and
