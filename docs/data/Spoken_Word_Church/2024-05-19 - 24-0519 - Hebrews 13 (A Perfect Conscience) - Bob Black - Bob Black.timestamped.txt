[0:01] God bless you and good
[0:06] morning let's just bow our head and go
[0:08] into the study Lord God we're so
[0:09] grateful to be able to gather around
[0:11] your word this morning and we know your
[0:13] word promises that we're two and threes
[0:15] are are gathered together in your name
[0:16] you'd be with our midst Lord Jesus and
[0:18] we just ask Lord that you'll feel at
[0:20] Liberty to be here today Lord we invite
[0:22] you in Lord God and I pray God that
[0:24] you'll just bless brother the waight as
[0:25] he's preparing and studying Lord open
[0:27] our the eyes of our heart to understand
[0:29] as we walk through the scriptures this
[0:30] morning Lord grant it Lord that you'll
[0:32] give us understanding we pray in your
[0:35] name so
[0:37] um I just wanted to thought I'd kind of
[0:41] uh sit on uh conscience a little bit
[0:43] more this morning I I got some feedback
[0:45] you know sometimes you you'll listen
[0:47] You'll read a scripture and you'll study
[0:48] something out and you realize you still
[0:52] don't understand it you know sometime I
[0:55] think that's one of the greatest
[0:56] blessings that when when you look at
[0:57] something and you realize there's still
[0:59] something like
[1:00] so um so I got some feedback from that
[1:03] um and you know I think it' be helpful
[1:06] to just kind of go over a little bit
[1:07] more and think about what a con what
[1:09] your conscience
[1:10] is but let's um so let's let's set the
[1:13] stage what what is your conscience when
[1:14] you're not born again God gives you that
[1:17] little voice down inside of your heart
[1:19] to be you you shouldn't eat those
[1:20] cookies or whatever but now with then
[1:22] when you're born it's like a stop light
[1:24] we looked at last time that it says you
[1:26] still don't don't do that don't step in
[1:28] the road don't you shouldn't be going in
[1:30] that direction but now when you're born
[1:33] again now God begins he's is like a
[1:35] supernatural stoplight now you you're
[1:39] now you know you shouldn't be committing
[1:40] adultery you shouldn't be doing things
[1:42] and and and uh it's and it begins to
[1:45] draw you to the word and the more the
[1:48] word you eat the more your conscience
[1:51] begins aligned it's like your conscience
[1:53] is is understand and I'll give you an
[1:56] example some people they're born again
[1:58] Christians and this is what PA addrress
[2:00] would say well I I'm not going to eat
[2:02] meat that was offered to an idol but
[2:04] others that wouldn't bother their
[2:06] conscience you see as you're eating the
[2:08] word it changes your perception of
[2:10] what's okay and what's not some people
[2:13] will put up a Christmas tree others
[2:15] won't even put a wreath up on their
[2:16] front door but you're not going to
[2:18] dechristianize one or the other see your
[2:21] conscience is beginning to be
[2:23] molded as it more the more words you eat
[2:26] it changes the way that you think about
[2:28] things now the main thing though is when
[2:31] your conscience says don't do it you
[2:33] better listen to it and and so so I'm
[2:36] going to go through some quotes and some
[2:38] some statements that were made the first
[2:40] one um I got a little example here of of
[2:43] polycarp being martyred and and brother
[2:45] brandom used this I think it was the
[2:47] church age book or where where he used
[2:50] this as an example of dying with a free
[2:52] conscience now you think how easy it
[2:55] would be somebody said well well just
[2:58] deny deny what you you believe it and
[3:00] just sign on the dotted line that you
[3:02] reject the the Protestant ideas and just
[3:05] take the Catholic Doctrine and and just
[3:08] go on with your normal life but
[3:10] polycarp's listening to his conscience
[3:13] he his conscience is telling him that
[3:16] what I believe matters and and so that's
[3:19] why it's so it's so it's important to
[3:21] listen to your conscience because your
[3:24] conscience will align you with the
[3:26] principles of the word and it will steer
[3:29] you in life
[3:30] to your Eternal destination so brother R
[3:33] said polycart was Marty too old to flee
[3:35] and too sincere a man to allow another
[3:37] to hide him and then suffer a penalty
[3:39] for doing so he gave himself up to death
[3:42] but before he did he asked for and was
[3:44] granted permission to pray two hours for
[3:46] his Brethren and the Lord for the
[3:48] governor for his enemies and his captors
[3:51] oh there's a there's a clear conscience
[3:54] when you're praying for the people that
[3:55] are about to burn you at the
[3:57] Stak like the great Saints of of all
[4:00] ages and Desiring a better Resurrection
[4:02] he stood firm refusing to deny the Lord
[4:05] and died with a free conscience now one
[4:09] of my favorite stories about having a
[4:10] free conscience is that story of Thomas
[4:12] Cromwell who was the Archbishop of
[4:15] Canterbury and they they gave him that
[4:17] same Choice sign away everything you
[4:20] believe in and he did he said you know
[4:22] what I'm I'm going to go give my rights
[4:24] and every and whatnot I'm I'm going to
[4:26] say that the Catholic Doctrine is
[4:28] correct and he signed it away and they
[4:31] said well you can go and live and and be
[4:33] happy but his conscience started
[4:34] bothering him because he knew what he
[4:37] believed was right and he signing that
[4:41] document was was going against his
[4:43] conscience what he knew was correct so
[4:47] we got that famous story of why when
[4:49] they burned him at the Stak he put his
[4:50] right hand into the flame and said this
[4:52] is the hand that hath offended the hand
[4:54] that signed that that document that said
[4:57] that he was going uh that that the
[4:59] Catholic Doctrine was
[5:00] right now Thomas
[5:02] aquinus said and I've got a scripture
[5:05] here to compare with what he said he
[5:06] said a man is bound according to his
[5:09] conscience even when it is in error
[5:13] because the Judgment of conscience is
[5:16] the Judgment of what he knows to be
[5:18] God's will so and I'll read the
[5:20] scripture here in a moment but now if
[5:21] you don't believe it's right to put up a
[5:23] Christmas tree and you boo It Anyway
[5:25] then you're acting in sin because you
[5:27] don't believe it and see what you're
[5:29] doing if you don't believe it's right to
[5:31] eat meat back in the Old Testament to
[5:34] eat meat offered to an idol and you do
[5:35] it anyway and you don't believe it's
[5:37] right now what kind of a situation do
[5:40] you have yourself in you're violating
[5:42] your own conscience you don't believe
[5:44] it's right but you're doing it anyway
[5:46] and that's what James 4:17 says if
[5:48] anyone then knows the good they ought to
[5:51] do and doesn't do it it is sin for them
[5:54] if you know if you know and believe that
[5:57] you should should or should not do
[5:59] something but but you do it or do not do
[6:00] it anyway then you're violating your
[6:02] conscience and Thomas aquinus will go on
[6:05] to say I'm just I'm just got a few
[6:06] statements that he said he said
[6:07] conscience is an act not a power it is
[6:09] an act of applying knowledge to
[6:11] something done as when one says I have a
[6:14] clear conscience that is because I know
[6:17] that I have not done anything wrong now
[6:21] now you can see now get the difference
[6:23] there in your soul God gives you that
[6:26] stoplight to know what to do but that in
[6:28] your spirit real we've got that label
[6:30] conscience because in your spirit realm
[6:33] you're battling you're battling over
[6:35] it's it's like brother R said the
[6:36] constellation of the solar the stun down
[6:38] at the uh the sun in the center and all
[6:41] the planets of your memories and
[6:42] Consciousness affection imagination
[6:44] around that God is aligning with that
[6:48] that truth in your soul he's aligning it
[6:50] so that you're C the way that you look
[6:52] at things the way that you reason things
[6:54] aligns with the Holy Ghost in your soul
[6:58] the battle though the battle is in your
[6:59] Spirit realm that conscience what what
[7:01] is right what is am I am I doing what's
[7:04] right or not and you battle it out and
[7:06] the only way that you'll really know
[7:08] what's right or not is to feed on the
[7:10] word until your whole being begins to
[7:12] align with the word amen that's why
[7:15] Hebrews 13:17 says obey them that have
[7:18] the rule over you and submit yourselves
[7:20] for they watch for your souls as they
[7:22] that must give account that they may do
[7:24] it with joy and not with grief for that
[7:26] is unprofitable for you pray for us for
[7:29] We Trust we have a good conscience and
[7:32] all things willing to live honestly now
[7:34] if you want to just kind of sum up what
[7:36] that means in plain language obey and
[7:39] submit to your spiritual leaders who are
[7:41] accountable to God for Watching Over The
[7:42] Souls of their congregation Christians
[7:45] should make their leaders task a joyful
[7:47] one not a burdensome one and pray for
[7:49] your spiritual leaders who strive to
[7:51] maintain a clear conscience and conduct
[7:54] themselves honorably in all aspects of
[7:58] life and Ministry
[8:00] so what's your conscience that that
[8:02] stoplight that says go or or don't don't
[8:05] you can go or you can't and it's there
[8:08] when you're not born again and it's
[8:11] there when you're born again and it
[8:13] keeps growing in maturity to know so
[8:16] that you know what you're here for and
[8:18] what your purpose is and how to approach
[8:20] situations and it turned well see I'm
[8:23] kind of jumping forward in our notes as
[8:25] you begin to get grow in maturity and
[8:28] understanding the word that you read
[8:30] actually becomes your Navigator and it
[8:32] helps you navigate situations that's why
[8:34] it says in the the Scripture it says he
[8:36] will lead you and guide you into all
[8:37] truth he gives you a guide to navigate
[8:40] things and to say you can't go here and
[8:42] you can go here and so forth and so on
[8:44] that's why brother R said and what think
[8:45] you of Christ he said well then you wait
[8:47] over that and next thing you know wait
[8:50] over that stoplight you pass by the
[8:52] church you hear the hymns you hear the
[8:54] preaching every red light God flashes
[8:56] before you you just break the barriers
[8:58] down and go right right on don't pay any
[9:01] attention to conscience or nothing else
[9:04] then did God send a person to hell no
[9:06] you sent yourself that's right you went
[9:09] on your own accord God throws every red
[9:12] light in front of you he could and you
[9:14] just keep moving right on headl long you
[9:17] determined to do
[9:19] it then he said now there's a red light
[9:21] hanging down here in the city if you run
[9:24] through that red light the city's not
[9:25] responsible for you you did it on your
[9:28] own will that's right so then God has
[9:30] done everything that he can to keep
[9:32] people and to bring them to him and love
[9:36] them now you can see that even the
[9:38] church and everything the battle the
[9:40] battle with that conscience you'll see
[9:41] somebody battling over they'll come and
[9:43] maybe they've been here for years and
[9:44] they come and they they the shirt skirt
[9:46] starts getting a little bit shorter and
[9:48] they they maybe they start trimming
[9:49] their hair off and you're wonder what's
[9:51] going on you know it's that that
[9:53] conscience are you listening to your
[9:55] conscience your conscience down inside
[9:57] of you is telling you you need to
[9:58] conform to the word and you stop
[10:00] listening to it and it starts causing
[10:02] problems stay right with the conscience
[10:04] because God it's a gift from God if
[10:07] we'll listen to it and heed it it will
[10:09] guide us all through life guide us
[10:11] through every challenge of life oh like
[10:14] like the like that I love quoting that
[10:16] scripture in Malachi 3 that says if you
[10:18] pay your tithe then you've got that
[10:20] promise that he will rebuke the devour
[10:23] and so when the devour comes when the
[10:24] boss starts firing people and whatnot
[10:26] you still got that promise I I've been
[10:28] doing what you my I've been doing what
[10:30] according to what my conscience tells me
[10:32] to do and now I can lay claim to that
[10:35] promise that the devour will be rebuked
[10:38] and everything about a Christian Life is
[10:40] is lined up with your obeying your
[10:42] conscience even when we come to church
[10:43] and we and we you when your baptized we
[10:45] use that example it's
[10:47] a is is representative of having a clear
[10:50] conscience and when you take communion
[10:53] you take the the bread and the and the
[10:55] wine you take it having a clear
[10:58] conscience and you know there's a simple
[11:00] remedy for having not having a clear
[11:02] conscience I I I'm just going to go on
[11:05] little tangents here for a little bit I
[11:07] I don't know why we sometimes battle so
[11:09] much over not taking communion when
[11:11] there's a simple remedy over not having
[11:13] a clear conscience if you've got all
[11:15] against your brother then go pray about
[11:17] it before the service you don't have to
[11:19] come here and sit and look and look at
[11:21] one another and say well I can't take
[11:22] communion for the next 6 months or
[11:24] whatever I take get it get it right get
[11:26] it taken care of go to somebody and
[11:28] apologize and humble yourself and say
[11:30] I'm sorry and then go on and and and and
[11:32] and take care and you see on the flip
[11:35] side you'll have you'll have those that
[11:37] don't care anything about the gospel
[11:38] they just they're not there for they're
[11:40] just kind of there because somebody
[11:41] dragged them to church and they don't
[11:43] want nothing to do with them they go
[11:44] home and and look at things online that
[11:46] they shouldn't have and you know their
[11:47] heart's not in it they're ain't dressing
[11:49] right they ain't doing right they ain't
[11:50] living right and it's all apparent but
[11:51] yet their conscience doesn't condemn
[11:53] them and they'll free to take communion
[11:56] so you got there's a there's a there's a
[11:58] right if will listen to our conscience
[12:01] and let it line us up with the word it
[12:02] will guide us and steer us right amen
[12:07] God's done everything that he can to
[12:08] keep people and bring them to him and
[12:11] love them and love them so what is your
[12:14] conscience the soul the conscience that
[12:17] once condemned you isn't there anymore
[12:19] he's given an example I'm just reading
[12:20] some different quotes to tell you what
[12:22] this the conscience is your soul your
[12:25] soul is your conscience and if you don't
[12:27] listen to it he said it'll a somebody
[12:30] that's not regenerated that last quote
[12:32] there you you keep pushing it down
[12:33] pushing it down until they're there're
[12:35] at the end in the days back there where
[12:37] they wouldn't give morphine uh it'll
[12:39] come up and you realize that there's
[12:42] something wrong with that Soul down on
[12:45] the inside that you hadn't been
[12:46] listening to listen to your conscience
[12:49] your inner conscience speaks louder than
[12:50] your mouth does and what does it say my
[12:53] brother I will give this example of the
[12:55] little boy sneaking behind the barn
[12:57] rolling up corn silk and smoking
[13:01] it now we probably all had different
[13:04] experiences like that going out the in
[13:06] the in the in the backyard and getting
[13:08] up to no good or whatever and you got
[13:10] that little voice that tells you don't
[13:12] do this little boy that's wrong don't do
[13:15] that and and and he uses that example of
[13:18] how his wife would say and I've got this
[13:21] picture this is called nomin nominal
[13:24] nominal uh Christianity or you're just
[13:27] doing it in name only and and it's just
[13:30] like
[13:31] uh seems like all of America's Gotten
[13:34] Trapped with this because they got an
[13:36] American flag waving behind them or they
[13:38] and they go to Dollywood and listen to
[13:40] some Christian singers or whatever they
[13:41] say I'm a Christian but that ain't got
[13:43] nothing to do with Christianity and
[13:45] brother Rand would use that example is
[13:47] his wife looking at the Finnish people
[13:49] they go to church why are they acting
[13:50] like why you know Americans that go to
[13:53] church why why can they get away with
[13:55] these things but I can't and he said why
[13:58] those people go to church and I've often
[14:00] wondered why it didn't condemn their
[14:01] conscience I said my dear wife let me
[14:03] tell you they are
[14:06] Americans what what does your conscience
[14:08] say see that's that's the main thing it
[14:12] are we listening to our
[14:15] conscience I was talking to Zach about a
[14:18] a situation where a young young man up
[14:21] there in North Carolina come out out out
[14:22] of a church that had got into all kinds
[14:24] of things and all sorts of doctrinal
[14:27] things and you know uh looking at it had
[14:29] a wonderful testimony because there's so
[14:31] many people that get caught up in things
[14:33] and they start looking at other uh false
[14:36] Doctrine and things and they begin to
[14:37] Come Away with the idea that the message
[14:39] is wrong well this young man came away
[14:41] with the idea that there's some people
[14:44] that just ain't living it and you know I
[14:46] think that's one of the greatest there's
[14:47] some one of the greatest Revelations is
[14:49] that there's there's the the gospel is
[14:53] true other people just sometimes don't
[14:56] live it my conscience will that make me
[14:59] act in a way that other PE different
[15:02] from the way that other people are and
[15:04] you just got to keep going right on with
[15:06] the straightened
[15:07] error don't look at other people just
[15:09] look at what your conscience is telling
[15:11] you to do because your conscience is
[15:13] what will lead and guide you it in
[15:16] Hebrews chapter 10:2 says for then would
[15:18] they not have ceased to be offered
[15:20] because that the worshippers once purred
[15:22] should have had no more conscience of
[15:23] sin so that's what happens when you're
[15:26] when you're born of the Holy Ghost and
[15:28] you're conscience is purged and cleaned
[15:31] up so that you don't have any desire
[15:34] you're don't there's no more desire for
[15:36] the things of the world your conscience
[15:39] has been changed you don't want to dress
[15:41] like the world anymore you don't want to
[15:43] do those things anymore you don't want
[15:45] to look at those things anymore you
[15:46] you've been
[15:47] changed and John 16:13 says how be it
[15:51] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[15:53] will guide you into all Truth for he
[15:56] shall not speak of himself but
[15:57] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[15:59] speak and he will show you things to
[16:01] come now that makes your conscience a
[16:04] holy ghost filled believer's conscience
[16:07] like your guide through the Maze of life
[16:09] that when you get into obstacles like
[16:11] you get into a place at work I I'm sure
[16:14] we've all seen where where people that
[16:16] don't have a conscience at work they'll
[16:17] just step over somebody and mow down
[16:20] other people they don't care they don't
[16:22] care about stealing something they don't
[16:24] care about those things and they'll just
[16:25] roll right on through because they're
[16:27] ignoring every stoplight
[16:29] and many times it seems like the
[16:30] Christian gets taken advantage of but a
[16:33] real Christian's got the stoplight in
[16:35] them because it's it's worth more than
[16:37] your life to obey your conscience like
[16:39] polycarp they burn me at the Stak it
[16:41] don't matter I'm doing what God told me
[16:43] to do now see that's that's more
[16:46] valuable than silver and gold and
[16:48] everything else if you obey your
[16:50] conscience down on the inside that tells
[16:52] you how to navigate situations and how
[16:54] to navigate life and where to go and how
[16:56] to treat others see see your the word
[16:59] becomes the way that you navigate things
[17:01] like for example do unto others as you
[17:04] would have them do unto you when you
[17:07] come to a scenario then you look at the
[17:09] word and the word will actually guide
[17:10] you how to how to how to approach
[17:13] it but the comforter which is the Holy
[17:16] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[17:18] name he shall teach you all things and
[17:21] bring all things to your remembrance
[17:23] whatsoever I have said unto you in 1
[17:27] Corinthians chapter 2 says but God God
[17:29] ha revealed them unto us by his spirit
[17:31] for the spirit searcheth all things ye
[17:34] the Deep things of God for what man
[17:37] knoweth the things of a man save the
[17:39] spirit of man which is in him how are
[17:41] you going to know what's in a man's
[17:42] heart unless you've got his Spirit well
[17:45] that's how you know the things that are
[17:46] in God's heart is have the same spirit
[17:49] and and if you listen to that it will
[17:51] teach you the word it will show you the
[17:53] word it will show you it it will be a a
[17:55] a guide through every situation in life
[17:58] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[18:00] but the spirit of God now we have
[18:02] received not the spirit of the world but
[18:06] the spirit which is of god that we might
[18:08] know the things that are freely given to
[18:10] us of God now that's that's what your
[18:15] conscience
[18:16] is and so Hebrews 13: 20:22 says now the
[18:19] God of Peace that brought again from the
[18:23] dead our lord
[18:24] Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep
[18:28] through the blood of the Everlasting
[18:30] Covenant make you perfect in every good
[18:33] work to do his will working in you that
[18:36] which is well pleasing in his sight
[18:38] through Jesus Christ to whom be glory
[18:40] forever and ever now see how that that
[18:43] you think maybe that doesn't tie into
[18:44] what we're talking about but it does tie
[18:46] in because a little baby don't know
[18:49] what's how to navigate the a maze but as
[18:52] it keeps learning and keeps being taught
[18:55] the the conscience begins to mature
[18:57] until it knows how react in different
[18:59] situations and what's happening is our
[19:02] conscience our the way that we the way
[19:04] that we look at things is changing and
[19:06] maturity until we're we're matured into
[19:09] a perfect a perfect man which is Christ
[19:12] Christ veiled in us to to act and react
[19:16] and look at things just like Christ
[19:18] does make you perfect in every good work
[19:21] and that's what the the Mandate there in
[19:23] Ephesians 4:11 to the five-fold ministry
[19:26] is for the perfecting of the Saints for
[19:29] the work of the ministry for the
[19:30] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[19:33] all come in the unity of the faith and
[19:36] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[19:38] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[19:41] stature of the fullness of
[19:43] Christ there's what Perfection is is
[19:46] completeness where God can take us and
[19:49] mold us so that we're we're trusting in
[19:52] that little uh like in the St in the uh
[19:54] statute of perfect man sermon brother
[19:56] Brown said it they they listen to that
[19:57] little little nod
[19:59] what where's that nod coming from from
[20:01] your conscience when you get that little
[20:04] that little prod or prick down in your
[20:07] heart to do like Phillip go talk to the
[20:09] Ethiopian unit go go over go turn aside
[20:13] and go to this little church over here
[20:16] speak on these things when you're
[20:18] ministering the little nod that kind of
[20:20] nudges your conscience your conscience
[20:22] is your
[20:23] guide and Thomas aquinus was I've got
[20:26] this little the little our our our
[20:28] stature of a man chart here as a as a
[20:30] comparison and Thomas aquinus would say
[20:32] conscience is the application of
[20:35] knowledge to action all this knowledge
[20:38] is packed in now what do I do with it
[20:41] I'm battling it out should I is is this
[20:44] right is it wrong but when it's packed
[20:47] in and you know what's right there your
[20:49] conscience is becoming subject to the
[20:51] word of
[20:52] God conscience is the application of
[20:55] knowledge to to action a judgment of
[20:57] reason whereby the human person person
[20:59] recognizes the moral quality of a
[21:02] concrete
[21:05] act and brother well well I've got this
[21:08] is a quote from Brother brown but
[21:10] Perfection is the condition state or
[21:11] quality of being free or as free as
[21:13] possible from all flaws or defects it
[21:17] implies completeness and a state of
[21:20] being without any limitations or defects
[21:24] and that's what Paul is aduring us to
[21:26] come to there at the end of Hebrews 13
[21:29] to Perfection so he says as we're about
[21:32] to close Hebrews 13 He says and I
[21:34] beseech you Brethren suffer the word of
[21:37] exhortation for I have written a letter
[21:39] unto you and few
[21:41] words know ye that our brother Timothy
[21:43] has set at Liberty with whom if he comes
[21:44] shortly I will see you salute all them
[21:48] that have the rule over you and all the
[21:50] saints they of Italy Salute You Grace be
[21:55] with you all amen
[21:58] now if we're going to look real quick in
[22:00] the last couple of minutes at a summary
[22:02] of Hebrews 13 just to kind of remember
[22:04] all these things that we've been
[22:05] studying over for the last year or
[22:08] so show uh well the last few months for
[22:12] Hebrews 13 show love and Hospitality to
[22:14] one another and
[22:16] strangers Paul told us to remember those
[22:19] who are imprisoned or mistreated to
[22:21] honor marriage and to avoid sexual
[22:24] immorality he told us there in verses 5
[22:26] and six we're warned against the love of
[22:28] money and encourage to be content and
[22:31] God promised that he would never leave
[22:33] us or forsake
[22:34] us in verse 7 he said remember and
[22:37] imitate the faith of our spiritual
[22:39] leaders considering the outcome of their
[22:42] way of life now isn't that something
[22:45] that the spiritual leaders are supposed
[22:46] to model Christianity so you look at
[22:48] them and say well I want to I want to be
[22:50] an overcomer like that and that's how we
[22:53] should live our lives and Paul
[22:55] emphasizes the unchanging nature of
[22:57] Jesus Christ
[22:59] and warned against being Carried Away by
[23:02] strange
[23:03] teachings and he said in verse 10 and 14
[23:05] to 14 Christians must bear the reproach
[23:08] of Christ because we're seeking a
[23:10] Heavenly city rather than an Earthly one
[23:12] thank God this ain't my home we're going
[23:15] somewhere Christians sacrifice
[23:18] themselves in verses 15 to 16 including
[23:20] the sacrifice of praise to God
[23:22] continually doing God and sharing doing
[23:25] good and sharing with others everything
[23:27] about your Christian Journey is a
[23:28] sacrifice you sacrifice to come to
[23:31] church today you sacrifice when you get
[23:33] up and and and and and do good and pray
[23:36] and and lay aside time to study your
[23:38] Bible it's all a sacrifice and verse 17
[23:41] we're called to obey and submit to our
[23:43] spiritual leaders as they keep watch
[23:45] over our
[23:46] souls so if you want to look at the
[23:48] whole book of Hebrews again Hebrews told
[23:51] us that Jesus is God and it told us that
[23:54] there's a new covenant that Christ come
[23:56] to establish and it stressed that that
[24:00] faith and perseverance and the face of
[24:02] Trials and hardships are critical and he
[24:04] showed us examples of Old Testament
[24:06] Hebrews there in Hebrews 11 who
[24:08] demonstrated faith and endured suffering
[24:11] Paul told us not to fall away from the
[24:13] faith but to keep on running like a race
[24:15] that you trying to get to the end cross
[24:17] the finish line keep on and don't give
[24:19] up and he compared the Earthly
[24:21] Tabernacle with the Heavenly Sanctuary
[24:24] where Christ serves as our high priest
[24:27] and he the fin final chapters offered
[24:29] practical advice for Christian Living
[24:32] including Brotherly Love Hospitality
[24:35] caring for others and submitting to our
[24:38] spiritual leaders if you want to find
[24:41] some good scriptures just call out
[24:42] Hebrews 1 and 1 1 to3 said God who at
[24:45] sunry times and in diverse manner spake
[24:47] in time passed under the fathers by the
[24:49] prophets and Hebrews 4 said the word is
[24:52] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[24:54] two-edged sword and Hebrews 4:14 to6
[24:58] says says seeing them we've got a high
[24:59] priest that is passed into the heavens
[25:02] so let us hold fast our profession we
[25:05] got a high priest that can be touched by
[25:07] the feelings of our infirmity so don't
[25:09] give up hold fast to that one that's
[25:11] going to come on the scene when you need
[25:13] it Hebrews 6 1920 says we've got which
[25:16] we we've got an anchor of the Soul both
[25:18] sure and steadfast and that which
[25:20] entereth into that within the veil
[25:22] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[25:24] even Jesus made in high priest Forever
[25:28] After after the order of melkisedek and
[25:30] Hebrews 11 said now Faith is the
[25:32] substance of things hoped for as the
[25:34] musicians go ahead and come forward
[25:36] without faith it is impossible to please
[25:38] him and Hebrews 12 we're accompass about
[25:42] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[25:45] Hebrews 12 told us that no chastening
[25:47] for the present seeth to be joyous but
[25:50] Grievous and Hebrews 13 told us let your
[25:53] conversation be without covetousness and
[25:56] be content with what you got and he
[26:00] closed Grace be with you all
[26:04] amen God bless you Saints
