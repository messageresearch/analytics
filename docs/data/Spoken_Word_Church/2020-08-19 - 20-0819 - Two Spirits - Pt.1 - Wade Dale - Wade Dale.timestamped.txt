[3:34] get the details from him but he is
[3:35] feeling so much better
[3:37] sounding so much better so we're praying
[3:40] for all these other ones too brother
[3:42] donnie reagan and all the different ones
[3:43] that are
[3:44] being diagnosed and people all over the
[3:47] country
[3:47] being diagnosed so we we want to pray
[3:50] for them
[3:51] um as well so let's turn to the
[3:54] book of first john 4.
[3:58] tonight we're going to uh this is just
[4:01] going to be
[4:02] the beginning or the um
[4:06] outlay of how we're going to cover this
[4:08] and we're going to call it
[4:10] two spirits because there's only two
[4:12] spirits
[4:14] there's different kind brother brown
[4:15] said cancer with the spirit
[4:17] diabetes is the spirit all of them have
[4:20] different spirits but there's two
[4:22] power there's two spirits that we need
[4:25] to deal with
[4:25] and you've got one spirit here with
[4:27] everything under it and then you got one
[4:28] spirit over here with everything under
[4:29] it
[4:30] okay you got demon you got when we're
[4:32] gonna go all the way back to the
[4:33] beginning
[4:34] where god created satan uh
[4:38] sorry lucifer made him perfect
[4:41] made him the right hand man
[4:44] give him power up to creation
[4:47] right okay so we're going to start that
[4:51] but i want to go through this
[4:52] and i want to i want to caution you
[4:55] because i was praying about
[4:56] yesterday pray about this morning again
[4:57] at all every time you start talking
[4:59] about two spirits and then when we start
[5:01] talking about how brother brown talks
[5:03] about the two spirits in the framework
[5:04] of the church
[5:07] please do not get in your mind a
[5:10] person's name
[5:14] except jesus christ and the devil
[5:19] okay not a brother well you're talking
[5:22] about brother
[5:23] i'm come back two spirits
[5:26] and brother brown said they're not out
[5:28] there they're right here
[5:31] so i'm not worried about brett now
[5:33] brother so-and-so is
[5:34] and i'll read it maybe today or maybe
[5:36] save it for sunday brother brown says
[5:38] you go by the characteristics of that
[5:40] spirit
[5:41] right because you really can't tell he's
[5:44] just as religious
[5:45] listen they couldn't tell judas and
[5:46] jesus sat down at the table he washed
[5:49] judas's feet
[5:50] gave him communion
[5:55] and then he went and did what he'd done
[5:56] real quick
[5:58] and he had everybody fooled except jesus
[6:00] christ
[6:01] so in the end time he's going to have
[6:03] everybody fooled except jesus christ
[6:05] all right and who is jesus christ his
[6:07] bride his bride is not a second person
[6:10] his bride
[6:11] is jesus christ okay all right
[6:15] so then you got the two spirits so when
[6:17] we start talking
[6:19] we may make some comments about certain
[6:21] things but please
[6:22] don't put a well that's brother he's
[6:24] talking about i
[6:25] in my mind humanly
[6:29] yes those names will pop up
[6:32] humanly but i am not directing this
[6:35] toward
[6:35] any one person because you do have to
[6:37] cover the characteristics of what
[6:39] happens
[6:40] when you have one spirit and the
[6:42] characteristics when you have another
[6:44] the other spirit so please don't think
[6:47] and i did i cautioned myself two days
[6:49] ago
[6:49] yeah yeah last night and even this
[6:52] morning while i was working
[6:53] he came back up again to caution the
[6:55] people
[6:56] do not think that i have a name written
[6:59] down
[7:00] that i'm talking about this certain
[7:02] person or this certain group of people
[7:06] okay but now that group and that person
[7:08] we're going to just let their
[7:09] characteristics because remember jesus
[7:11] told them
[7:12] he said let's don't harvest this right
[7:14] now
[7:16] right he said wait till it matures
[7:20] because you go out of my garden now and
[7:22] you see mature okra but when it was only
[7:25] about this high
[7:26] it looked like a weed right so you let
[7:29] them both
[7:30] mature that's what we're going to
[7:32] discuss this afternoon
[7:33] you got to let them both mature that's
[7:35] why god didn't cut them down
[7:37] in luther's day he didn't cut them down
[7:39] in wesley's day
[7:40] he didn't cut them down in pentecost but
[7:43] when it comes over to where the full
[7:45] grain is that's when jesus said okay
[7:48] go put the sickle in and harvest
[7:52] separate burn and eject
[7:56] and that's exactly what's going to
[7:57] happen but we're going to go back to the
[7:59] beginning of time
[8:00] before time even was thank god for a
[8:03] prophet
[8:04] that could let us not just not just him
[8:08] brother louise let
[8:09] us go back into that same mind that he
[8:12] went back into
[8:14] and let us see the same thing he saw
[8:19] he come back and told us give us clarity
[8:21] so that when we do look
[8:22] over into that other dimension or that
[8:25] other place we know what we're looking
[8:26] at
[8:27] all right so see there's the two spirits
[8:30] i was thinking i was
[8:31] uh just for a second i was listening to
[8:34] the prophet
[8:36] how many times that he said he said i'll
[8:39] have to give an account
[8:41] for what i'm telling you with this bible
[8:43] open in front of me i tell you thus
[8:45] saith the lord and for somebody to say
[8:48] he was wrong
[8:52] see there we go we start going with
[8:54] names no characteristics
[8:56] it's a characteristic of the devil
[8:58] that's not god when it's anti-word
[9:02] but how in the world can you if you deny
[9:04] brother branham in one point you've got
[9:06] to deny that you've got to say that he
[9:07] lied 1100 and sometimes
[9:12] you got to say he lied when he went
[9:13] across the curtain of time you got to
[9:14] say he lied when he did this he like
[9:16] how in the world uh
[9:20] we had the pure unadulterated word given
[9:23] to us by a prophet that made
[9:24] human mistakes but his message was pure
[9:28] glorious and still is pure it has been
[9:31] made unpure
[9:33] by that other spirit amen so let's go to
[9:36] first john 4 and we'll
[9:38] get into this a little bit tonight let's
[9:39] pray before we get get started get
[9:41] somebody on your mind now as we pray
[9:43] you get somebody on your mind that's
[9:45] been sick uh
[9:46] that's that's ailing you just get
[9:48] somebody on your mind now unless and
[9:50] let's pray and see what god do also
[9:51] remember me
[9:52] uh i went yesterday to have a physical
[9:55] they don't do the from head to toe
[9:56] anymore i was expecting a full physical
[9:58] and
[9:59] i didn't get it he asked a lot of
[10:01] questions i could have lied
[10:02] you know how is this oh great you know
[10:06] but uh they did take blood and i have
[10:08] this thing right here in my throat
[10:09] that feels like somebody's finger
[10:11] sticking in it so it's the devil it's
[10:13] not god
[10:14] so it it kind of hinders me a little bit
[10:17] but we're going to walk on by faith
[10:19] he gave me a couple of things to take
[10:21] for acid reflux and then we're going to
[10:24] look a little bit further but we know
[10:25] god's a healer
[10:27] we know god's one is in control so we
[10:29] just pray that
[10:30] it's just aggravating it doesn't hurt
[10:32] it's just aggravating you ever had a
[10:33] piece of gum stuck in you
[10:34] or a pill stuck in the back of your
[10:36] throat or something that's the way it
[10:37] feels 24 7 with me so it's just
[10:39] aggravating
[10:40] but let's pray that that thing will not
[10:41] go any further all right so let's bow
[10:43] our heads
[10:43] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[10:45] this opportunity that you've given us
[10:48] to as we can sit here and listen to you
[10:52] father
[10:53] but lord you've used the devil's
[10:56] technology
[10:59] lord for your honor and glory and it's
[11:00] to let people sit at home and watch
[11:03] live online and be part of the service
[11:06] now father we pray that you would
[11:09] that you would go to each home and
[11:11] wherever the people may be lord and
[11:14] may they enter into the worship of the
[11:15] service father and
[11:17] may you anoint these lips and anoint the
[11:19] ears to hear father
[11:21] lord we pray everyone now has got
[11:23] someone on their mind
[11:24] and on their heart we pray lord that you
[11:26] would send your visiting angel lord to
[11:29] visit whatever the sickness or the
[11:31] person or the
[11:32] or the temptation or the trial someone's
[11:34] going through or
[11:35] or salvation or the different things
[11:37] that we that we
[11:38] under this token lord that we can call
[11:41] on your name father and
[11:42] know that that token has been applied
[11:45] lord we all have sicknesses in our
[11:47] bodies and things that go wrong
[11:48] we're getting older and things are
[11:50] wearing out but father you told us that
[11:53] you had a bomb you had a bomb in gilead
[11:58] and you were the physician that
[12:00] administered that bomb it wasn't in the
[12:02] wrong hands it was in the right hands
[12:03] all the time
[12:04] and we pray that you'd apply that to us
[12:06] all now father
[12:08] be with us in the furthermore service
[12:09] give us revelation lord because we love
[12:11] it
[12:12] in jesus name we pray amen first john 4
[12:16] verse 1
[12:16] says beloved believe not every spirit
[12:21] but try the spirits whether they are of
[12:24] god
[12:26] because many false prophets are gone out
[12:28] into the world
[12:30] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[12:34] every spirit that confesses now we're
[12:36] going to cover that right there i'm
[12:37] going to tell you that just blew my mind
[12:40] because you know you can go ask the
[12:41] drunk
[12:43] if jesus is christ and he's going to say
[12:47] yeah yeah buddy i saw him last week
[12:52] but and you say well that's a confession
[12:55] we know that's confess it confesseth
[12:58] it's an ongoing thing
[13:00] but that word right there we're going to
[13:03] cover it probably sunday but not tonight
[13:04] we're just going to give an overview and
[13:06] then back up
[13:06] that word confesseth look it up in your
[13:09] in your
[13:09] uh concordance it talks about logos
[13:14] buddy now when you go to logos it is
[13:18] not the devil it's christ
[13:22] so that word confesseth that jesus
[13:25] in other words you know that person
[13:29] that logos is not just out there
[13:32] somewhere
[13:33] right it's right here so your confession
[13:35] comes from the logos that's inside of
[13:37] you
[13:38] well i about shouted the other day when
[13:40] i saw it because i just looked up
[13:41] confesses
[13:41] and i thought well you know everybody's
[13:43] good to confess and it's good to
[13:45] make a confession look that up in
[13:47] strong's
[13:48] you go to two different words and one is
[13:50] logos right to
[13:51] write to who god almighty confess us
[13:54] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[13:57] is of god because you know what even
[13:59] denominations even listen that other
[14:02] spirit knows he came in the flesh
[14:06] he knows that so then if he confesses
[14:10] that jesus is coming flesh is of god no
[14:11] he's not of god
[14:12] but if you confess that logos to the
[14:15] logos the lord said unto my lord
[14:17] when that connects there's the
[14:19] difference
[14:20] and every spirit that confesses here we
[14:23] go again and every spirit
[14:25] that confesseth not that jesus christ
[14:28] has come in the flesh
[14:29] is not of god now look that's a higher
[14:32] order you come on up a little bit higher
[14:33] because you know what
[14:34] they know jesus christ came in human
[14:36] flesh back there
[14:38] i know you're standing but you won't
[14:39] sleep while you're standing up
[14:44] back there oh yeah jesus came in human
[14:46] flesh the son of man came in human flesh
[14:48] we know 2
[14:49] 000 years ago what's our revelation
[14:52] today folks
[14:54] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[14:58] not was
[15:01] if you confess not that jesus christ is
[15:03] coming the flesh
[15:05] you're not of god and this is
[15:08] that spirit of antichrist whereof you
[15:11] have heard
[15:13] see they heard remember saying deed
[15:17] doctrine go through the seals
[15:18] all right but now it's not a sane deed
[15:21] or a doctrine
[15:22] it's an incarnate person we've come into
[15:24] the apex of all this and that's what i
[15:26] got on my notes we get to it
[15:28] that it should come and even now already
[15:31] is it in the world this is john
[15:35] coming from the isle of patmos about
[15:36] 1896 antichrist
[15:38] listen when jesus christ came the
[15:40] antichrist came
[15:41] ye are of god little children and have
[15:44] overcome
[15:45] them what the anakin spirit because
[15:48] greater is he that's in you
[15:49] than heed us in the world amen they are
[15:53] of the world
[15:55] therefore speak they of the world
[15:59] and the world listen heareth them
[16:03] father son holy ghost baptism oh the
[16:06] world hears that
[16:08] oh yeah 99.9 of the people that's the
[16:11] way you've got to be baptized but that's
[16:12] not true
[16:14] they heareth we are of god
[16:17] he that knoweth god heareth
[16:21] us
[16:24] remember what we talked about the other
[16:25] day that trumpet gives an uncertain
[16:27] sound you talk to people about the
[16:30] the revelation that we have
[16:34] and it's not common to them
[16:37] so they don't even listen they're not
[16:39] hearing what you're saying
[16:42] they're hearing words but it has no
[16:45] place in them
[16:46] that's what jesus told the pharisees he
[16:48] said you're hearing what i said
[16:51] but there's no place for it to land
[16:53] inside of you
[16:55] he that is not of god here is not us
[16:57] hereby
[16:58] know we know
[17:01] we the spirit of truth
[17:05] all right and the spirit of error so
[17:08] hereby we know
[17:09] you may be seated in the lord's blessing
[17:10] to reading the word hereby ye know
[17:13] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[17:16] error
[17:17] now we we've come to the place to where
[17:19] we were you know you can title these any
[17:21] way you want to and
[17:22] we were talking about doing uh uh naming
[17:25] it the uh
[17:28] trail the serpent but you know that's
[17:29] kind of aggravating to me to just have
[17:31] to tell what the devil's done
[17:33] i like to tell what god's done and then
[17:36] satan's always going to be there in
[17:38] opposition
[17:39] so let's just see what happens back then
[17:42] but now let's start right here and watch
[17:43] matthew 24
[17:45] jesus told us verse 23 says then if any
[17:48] man shall say unto you lo
[17:50] here is christ or there believe it not i
[17:52] preached on this many times before
[17:54] the only reason
[17:57] you are going to know that christ is not
[18:01] over there
[18:02] is why because he's right here amen
[18:07] you're saying now brother if you've got
[18:09] the same christ i've got
[18:11] we can talk but if you've got a christ
[18:14] that's different than mine
[18:17] we can't talk and it's obvious you won't
[18:20] have a very long conversation
[18:22] amen now
[18:26] i'm talking about the world but how much
[18:28] more as you come on in to get a little
[18:29] bit closer
[18:31] to the message of the hour where church
[18:34] is split over doctrines
[18:35] you got one church over here uh you know
[18:37] you got uh
[18:38] 900 something denominations in this
[18:40] message versus what brother brown said
[18:43] was out in the world
[18:45] and it is it's come to a place to where
[18:47] this is where all the denomination heads
[18:49] up
[18:52] baptist he's got methodist satan that is
[18:55] he's got them he's right here looking
[18:58] for me and you
[18:59] to slip up and fall go another way
[19:02] have another thought or idea contrary to
[19:06] the word of god
[19:08] amen that's why i want us to remember
[19:11] it's always word first
[19:14] amen word first it was a brother sent me
[19:18] something the other day and
[19:19] some brother in the philippines just you
[19:22] know put his little chart out again on
[19:24] daniel 70 weeks and
[19:26] and i just wrote back a comment i wrote
[19:29] he needs to read the bible
[19:32] he needs to read the bible the bible
[19:34] tells us clearly what daniel 70 week
[19:36] says but everybody says well i got a
[19:37] quote
[19:38] quote can't quote cannot contradict the
[19:42] bible
[19:48] but you can twist the quote but they can
[19:50] also twist the bible
[19:54] satan twisted it by one word that's what
[19:56] we're going to go back to in the garden
[19:57] of eden in a little while
[19:58] matthew 24 but look jesus now this is
[20:00] jesus talking
[20:02] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[20:03] here is christ or there
[20:05] believe it not
[20:08] for there shall arise false christ
[20:11] remembering anointed ones it's not just
[20:13] false people
[20:15] false christs because they're going to
[20:17] show great signs and wonders
[20:21] don't you worry that's going to be
[20:23] that's going to be the downfall of
[20:25] many people if they don't have the holy
[20:28] ghost and even with the baptism of the
[20:29] holy ghost if you've not been
[20:31] taught correctly you're going to lean
[20:33] towards signs and wonders every time
[20:36] every time every time
[20:40] but as we've always said signs should
[20:43] follow the believer not believers
[20:47] falling after the signs and it happens
[20:49] and it's happening and it's always going
[20:50] to happen
[20:51] and those that look like maybe and here
[20:54] i go i'm not naming names but
[20:56] those that look like are false
[21:00] word faults doctrinally false
[21:04] folks they're going to have signs and
[21:05] wonders like you wouldn't believe
[21:06] because the anointing as bob was talking
[21:08] about the other day
[21:09] read that book god of this evil age read
[21:13] anointed ones at the end time
[21:15] they're so close so they're going to
[21:19] have signs and wonders i mean what are
[21:20] you going to do like brother dale said
[21:21] what are you going to do when somebody
[21:23] walks up to you and sticks to your
[21:24] finger and then sticks their finger in
[21:26] your nose
[21:27] and says i'll raise him 10 people and
[21:29] show you that i'm true
[21:33] what are you going to do i'm going to
[21:35] say praise god them 10 people got
[21:37] brought back to life
[21:39] but your spirit's wrong
[21:42] because it's contrary to the bible all
[21:44] right it's contrary to the word of god
[21:45] because watch this is what jesus said
[21:47] for there shall arise false christ and
[21:50] false prophets
[21:51] and shall show great signs and wonders
[21:54] in so much
[21:55] that if it were possible they shall
[21:58] deceive the very
[22:01] elect now we know the very elect cannot
[22:05] be deceived
[22:07] but we'll read some other quotes a
[22:10] little bit later on where
[22:13] you see now in the end time even people
[22:15] that that
[22:16] are uh spirit-filled people
[22:20] um you know running off on different
[22:22] things you know the holy ghost is
[22:24] it's wonderful but remember in the end
[22:26] time always remember this
[22:29] it's an anointing in the end time
[22:32] now not to the true belief i'm talking
[22:34] about it's an anointing though that
[22:35] falls remember we're reading joy
[22:37] we're going to bring it from the bible
[22:38] all the way through joel said i'll pour
[22:40] out my spirit upon
[22:42] all flesh so everybody's going to get
[22:46] the benefit
[22:47] of the feeling but somewhere they're
[22:50] going to deny
[22:52] one word right because satan got them
[22:56] by one word and by one word off it
[22:59] caused all this
[23:00] so how in the world are we going to
[23:02] stand up here and be one word off
[23:04] and go back to the garden of eden
[23:07] can't do that but listen you say well
[23:10] there's no way we can be one hundred
[23:11] percent jesus christ is one hundred
[23:13] percent wondering
[23:14] and we're supposed to have the mind of
[23:16] christ right
[23:21] then he made a way and it's called this
[23:24] end time message
[23:25] it's not called luther it's not called
[23:27] wesley that's part of it but it's called
[23:29] this
[23:29] end time message that sets everything
[23:32] apart so let's go to the first quote
[23:37] remember what jesus said it could
[23:39] deceive they shall
[23:40] deceive the very elect if it were
[23:42] possible
[23:44] but i love there in the bible in the
[23:46] book of revelations when we ever get to
[23:48] the book of revelations with this two
[23:50] spirits
[23:50] it says he that overcometh
[23:54] to him that overcometh what did you
[23:56] overcome you overcame that other spirit
[24:00] brother john that's real simple you say
[24:02] no i'll overcome
[24:03] alcohol and women and drugs and
[24:07] no you overcame my other spirit
[24:11] because it was right here it was working
[24:13] right here
[24:16] in the children of disobedience and
[24:17] that's us
[24:20] before we're born again and even after
[24:23] we get born again aren't we kind of a
[24:25] little disobedient
[24:26] i thought we needed that for obedience
[24:28] okay
[24:30] he's still working on me
[24:33] i hope this makes us all realize we
[24:35] still got a little work to do
[24:37] hey man so let's read the first quote i
[24:39] love this quote here this is 1953 god
[24:41] commissioning moses
[24:43] because watch the bible i said the bible
[24:45] spoke of you and on that
[24:46] on the days i said remember our troubles
[24:49] my brothers
[24:50] sister i'm telling you now it's not
[24:52] coming from
[24:53] communism in the outside world this is
[24:55] 1953 everybody
[24:57] russia was raising up everybody was
[24:59] going communism is the antichrist
[25:04] no then we're going to read another one
[25:06] down here where he says don't worry
[25:07] about russia
[25:09] so let's not worry about the united
[25:10] states let's don't worry about trump
[25:13] who's going to win who's not going to
[25:14] win
[25:15] okay because watch where it started it
[25:17] didn't start down here
[25:21] it's not coming from communism and the
[25:24] outside world
[25:28] it's right on the inside of us
[25:33] brother brown that's just way too close
[25:35] no that's right where it needs to be
[25:38] the antichrist is a religious spirit
[25:42] it started in seed back yonder in
[25:45] genesis
[25:46] through cain okay
[25:50] and boy you just waited we get into
[25:52] james 4 where it says when lust is
[25:54] conceived brings forth sin when
[25:56] sin is finished it brings forth death
[25:58] it's not bad to sin folks because we're
[26:00] sinners
[26:02] when sin is conceived brings forth
[26:06] death when we keep when he can when he
[26:07] continues on
[26:09] and that's what's going to carry that
[26:11] second spirit that's what we're going to
[26:12] talk about remember that second spirit
[26:14] is going to carry you
[26:15] to a physical death and a spiritual
[26:18] death
[26:20] now you may go to a natural death and
[26:22] have the other spirit
[26:24] the the the christ-like spirit the
[26:26] christ spirit or the holy ghost
[26:27] sure there's many people in the grave
[26:29] right now that the holy ghost is
[26:31] it was in them and now it's over in
[26:32] another dimension
[26:34] but now this guy over here there's no
[26:36] turning back away from this one
[26:38] once you get this one that's why that
[26:40] it's going to be so close in the end
[26:42] time
[26:42] but like brother brown said he said when
[26:44] you he said just a
[26:46] razor's edge and you're standing on it
[26:50] and you slip off one side of the other
[26:52] he said that that
[26:54] wedge continues and you don't get
[26:57] you never can if you ever took a an
[27:00] axe and hit something or watch the water
[27:03] go around something that's like this it
[27:06] never comes back
[27:07] it continues away and that's what we're
[27:10] talking about now
[27:11] is those two spirits they have to be
[27:13] separated brothers and sisters
[27:15] in this end time is the only time that
[27:18] those two spirits
[27:19] are going to come to head and they're
[27:21] going to be
[27:24] made manifest is in this end time
[27:27] all right just as we go up that statue
[27:30] of a perfect man
[27:31] satan is taking his perfect man and
[27:34] going up that statue of a perfect man
[27:36] you ever thought about that remember
[27:38] there's two spirits there's two there's
[27:39] twins in every revival
[27:41] there's two spirits satan's won't listen
[27:45] satan's problem is he's wanting to climb
[27:47] up above this right here
[27:49] he's wanting to be up here where no man
[27:52] is but him see he wants to be number one
[27:55] well god's not going to stand for that
[27:57] god didn't make him for that
[28:00] god made him to drive me and you to that
[28:03] amen all right it started in seed back
[28:06] under in genesis through cain because
[28:09] remember
[28:10] now look one thing's for sure
[28:13] i am not will not
[28:16] and cannot speak on two natural seed
[28:19] lines
[28:22] if you're on this one you're good if
[28:24] you're on forget that
[28:28] now cain we know where he came from
[28:32] but you got to remember have you forgot
[28:34] one thing
[28:36] eve had holy ghost in her soul
[28:41] so he had a holy ghost phil mama
[28:44] cain that is but cain when he come
[28:47] out and grew up he had to make a choice
[28:49] just like the rest of us
[28:51] when the lust disconceived brings forth
[28:53] sin when sin is finished brings forth
[28:55] death
[28:55] cain had an opportunity so you can't say
[28:57] well now listen you can say
[29:00] hold on you can say that from
[29:03] god's point of view which is eternal
[29:07] omnipotent omnipresent knows everything
[29:11] he knew that cain would go wrong
[29:15] okay so on that side brother brown said
[29:18] cain was serpent seed
[29:22] judas was the antichrist
[29:27] born well he still had a choice
[29:32] judas still has every person that was
[29:34] born on this earth
[29:35] has got a choice they can't be one
[29:38] person born different except jesus
[29:40] christ
[29:41] himself and he had to come to give us a
[29:44] choice
[29:45] amen it's kind of real simple but people
[29:48] try to make it so boy cain was just
[29:52] uh he blessed god he was just serpent
[29:54] seed well yeah he did come from the
[29:55] serpent
[29:56] he did have a seed in him that come from
[29:58] natural seed come from that serpent
[30:00] but his mama was a religious woman she
[30:03] was
[30:04] we're going to see her in our camp
[30:09] we forget that don't we oh abel adam was
[30:12] righteous adam adam adam
[30:14] adams when it sold us out folks wasn't
[30:17] eve
[30:17] it was adam's the one that sold us out
[30:22] why the second adam had to bring us back
[30:24] all right they'll be okay there
[30:26] we're going to start a little slow but
[30:27] it started in seed back under in genesis
[30:30] through cain cain offered the same kind
[30:33] of sacrifice
[30:34] he knelt down and prayed he'd done
[30:38] everything religious that abel done
[30:41] yes sir and jesus said the two spirits
[30:43] in the last days
[30:45] would be so close it would deceive the
[30:46] very elect if possible
[30:49] now remember if we were standing back
[30:51] and watching
[30:53] cain and abel we'd think abel was kind
[30:56] of like jacob he's a little lazy
[30:59] all he's got to do is take them sheep up
[31:01] on the thing and let them eat grass and
[31:02] do their business
[31:03] and haul them in at night kind of a lazy
[31:06] kid
[31:08] all right and here's kane
[31:12] i don't want to be that way but like me
[31:14] going out every day and
[31:15] toiling in that garden but you know what
[31:18] cain did though
[31:20] came put everything he had in the wrong
[31:22] thing
[31:24] but he put everything he had in that
[31:27] thing
[31:28] because god said that's not that's not
[31:30] the way it's beautiful
[31:32] i mean why would you look at why would
[31:35] john be on the isle of patmos and this
[31:37] this of a church would raise up
[31:40] and john looks over and admires the
[31:42] church
[31:44] admires the woman she was beautiful
[31:48] take rome take all the different things
[31:50] that we look at that's
[31:51] that i don't say the people i say the
[31:53] system is anti
[31:56] but look how beautiful it is oh it's
[31:58] just beautiful they got these great big
[32:00] churches and
[32:01] they they got these big hospitals and
[32:02] they that's okay
[32:05] that's okay but we know that that
[32:08] antichrist system is working in that
[32:10] right system the two
[32:14] spirits would be so close so what i'm
[32:16] saying cain and abel
[32:18] you're standing there looking at them
[32:20] you would have picked cain just like you
[32:22] would have picked esau
[32:23] and probably would have picked judas
[32:25] over all the other disciples
[32:27] because he was the one that had the
[32:28] money he was kind of the accountant guy
[32:31] keep everything level hey can we buy
[32:33] this can we buy that you know
[32:38] but
[32:41] he let it carry him on over to where he
[32:44] crossed the line
[32:45] and we'll talk to that about that later
[32:47] on not today well i'm just going to give
[32:48] you an overview of what we're going to
[32:49] talk about
[32:50] let's look at number two the end time
[32:52] 1954.
[32:54] now kane came and knelt at the gate not
[32:56] an infidel
[33:01] listen all this is going on in the world
[33:03] and and
[33:04] and the the iraq and iran and all the
[33:07] different places
[33:08] they love their god
[33:11] they'll die for theirs
[33:15] will you die for yours so the the
[33:19] antichrist spirit
[33:20] is we we got to quit looking at it as
[33:22] being so anti
[33:25] that we think so anti that we think
[33:28] that oh it's got to be i thought
[33:31] brother brown said it was in us i'll go
[33:34] back to the
[33:35] i'll go back to that quote where brother
[33:36] brown says it's right on the inside of
[33:39] us right all right number two now cain
[33:42] came and knelt at the gate
[33:44] not an infidel many are thinking of the
[33:46] antichrist being russia
[33:48] get it out of your minds never the
[33:50] antichrist is
[33:52] religious
[33:55] jesus said the two spirits would be so
[33:56] close he deceived the very elective
[33:58] possible
[33:59] don't worry about russia they're just a
[34:01] bunch of atheists
[34:03] yes but the antichrist sits
[34:06] right by you
[34:10] sister esther you're the only one
[34:11] sitting real close to tony so
[34:13] take your choice
[34:17] but the antichrist sits right by you i
[34:20] i'm listen the antichrist is right here
[34:23] he's working trying to tell me things in
[34:26] my mind put things in your mind
[34:29] amen if not please come up here and take
[34:32] over
[34:34] but it's a fight combat beast
[34:39] not picnic beast combat beast
[34:42] it's a fight whoever said this was going
[34:44] to be just
[34:45] listen we get our flowery bed of ease
[34:47] when everything's over
[34:49] we get to spend an eternity not having
[34:53] to worry about none of this
[34:54] anymore there'll be no two factions
[34:56] there'll be no
[34:57] two opinions there'll be no two spirits
[35:03] one spirit's gonna live for eternity
[35:05] one's gonna be done away well
[35:07] you gotta decide which one you want
[35:10] but the antichrist sits right by you
[35:13] that's the deceiver
[35:15] remember just the time that judas jesus
[35:17] christ came on the scene
[35:19] the antichrist came on judas about time
[35:22] jesus revealed himself
[35:24] as the son of god judas revealed himself
[35:28] just the time jesus went away judas went
[35:31] away
[35:32] just the time the holy ghost come the
[35:34] antichrist spirit come
[35:36] so remember you see the moving of the
[35:39] holy spirit you see like brother dale
[35:40] we've been talking about revival for a
[35:42] long time
[35:43] satan has his own revival too
[35:46] amen he fell a church faster than the
[35:49] believer's camp
[35:51] remit don't remember don't put it don't
[35:53] put don't put anything on that
[35:55] okay but he can fill up a church fast or
[35:57] why signs and wonders get everybody
[35:59] going get everybody happy together by
[36:01] feeling good get the song service going
[36:03] good
[36:03] let somebody play we'll have two bases
[36:05] instead of one we'll have
[36:07] you understand what i mean well what
[36:09] about the word wow let's get all happy
[36:12] first
[36:14] yeah that's the devil because we're
[36:18] going to go back and we're going to
[36:19] study his tactic because remember
[36:21] he's the worship angel he's the
[36:25] god song leader brother dick always
[36:26] hated when i always said that
[36:28] but but but he was
[36:31] he was the worship angel he was created
[36:34] to
[36:34] to be the apex of worship
[36:38] but remember what he did with that apex
[36:40] of worship he wanted to go higher than
[36:42] head than the head that made him
[36:44] i if i'm looking at a man that created
[36:48] me
[36:48] i should know real quick i'm always
[36:51] going to be number two
[36:53] he'll be number one but now remember
[36:56] though
[36:56] jesus christ was a creator but he what
[36:58] did he do with us
[37:00] he put a little man down here called
[37:02] william branham and there was some
[37:04] squirrels got created into existence
[37:07] there was things got we've seen things
[37:09] created we've seen things done
[37:12] so let's don't be so well i'm number two
[37:15] no you're part of number one and being
[37:18] part of number one makes you number one
[37:22] we just got to get rid of that other
[37:23] spirit
[37:25] that's haunting us and telling us other
[37:28] things
[37:30] you don't have to go to church now you
[37:31] can sit at home now all you got to do is
[37:33] press play all you got to do is press
[37:35] and i mean play like tonight play not
[37:38] press play
[37:39] we press play anytime we want to okay
[37:41] but i'm talking about wow we can click
[37:43] on and watch so and so and so and so on
[37:46] don't even have to go to church i've
[37:48] it's just not in me to miss
[37:50] this it's not in me to miss this there's
[37:53] a longing as brother brown said he said
[37:55] a holy ghost-filled person can't wait
[37:58] for the doors to open
[37:59] so that we can get in here to worship
[38:01] all right so just telling you some
[38:02] things that brother brown told us
[38:04] just the time judas went away judas went
[38:06] away just the time the holy spirit came
[38:08] the antichrist spirit came look and they
[38:11] were brothers
[38:12] in the same church
[38:15] i'm going to say one more time there's
[38:17] only two spirits
[38:20] two there's not three or four now
[38:23] there's a lot underneath
[38:25] but there's only the holy spirit and the
[38:28] antichrist or you can say jesus christ
[38:30] and the antichrist that's the only two
[38:31] spirits
[38:32] that they are so get that in your mind
[38:34] that then you won't talk
[38:36] like brother brown and bro i believe
[38:37] brother branham truthfully when he was
[38:39] talking about denominations
[38:41] he hated to say the things he did
[38:44] but he was talking about the system they
[38:46] were in
[38:48] but you got to remember though you got
[38:50] to remember if you make yourself part of
[38:52] that system
[38:53] you're the system that's why the bible
[38:57] says come out of her
[38:58] my people come out
[39:02] under that thing and be partakers of
[39:05] what the spiritual
[39:06] of the spiritual gift of god which is
[39:07] the baptism of the holy ghost all right
[39:09] look they were brothers
[39:10] in the same church
[39:14] i believe as we go back into the
[39:16] beginning or before the beginning
[39:18] i like brother brown says before the
[39:20] beginning before the eternal
[39:22] how can you do that well you have to
[39:24] start somewhere and you find that mine
[39:26] but you got jesus or you got christ
[39:29] whatever you want to call him
[39:31] you got the logos you've got the father
[39:34] standing here and there's another person
[39:35] standing beside of him
[39:37] and it ain't a second person of a
[39:38] trinity
[39:41] it's the other it's the guy he created
[39:44] to be right there beside of him
[39:46] and we're going to read that he didn't
[39:48] he didn't create the devil to go do his
[39:50] now he knew he would he knew he
[39:53] he knew listen he knew cain would but
[39:56] you can't say
[39:58] he was born serpent seed
[40:02] but you and i all were born serpent seed
[40:05] but not the
[40:06] seed not the little seed like you put in
[40:10] the ground
[40:11] no it's a seed of discrepancy
[40:14] it was not a literal little seed it was
[40:16] we were born wrong with a carnal mind
[40:20] which put us on this side but thank god
[40:24] we had a choice to get on this side
[40:27] well that took that what'd he do with
[40:29] that seed
[40:31] right oh well
[40:35] he destroyed your own nature but he used
[40:39] that same
[40:40] person for the glory of god
[40:44] right god don't have to
[40:47] see satan almost has to destroy people
[40:51] to have anything everything he touches
[40:55] cancer leukemia all that comes from from
[40:58] the devil
[41:00] so everything he's touching and trying
[41:02] to make good
[41:04] falls apart because he's always negative
[41:07] he's always on the negative side
[41:10] but see everything christ touches is
[41:12] eternal
[41:13] glory so when he touched your soul
[41:17] he made your soul return
[41:20] he changed you brother brown said
[41:23] from a kookaburra to a wheat oh now i
[41:26] got a quote where i always was wheat
[41:30] in the mind of god absolutely
[41:34] you got to remember brother branham
[41:36] spoke a lot of things
[41:37] in the mind of god he was speaking
[41:41] for god and now what a prophet does
[41:47] speaks instead of god we'll get into
[41:49] that when because satan wanted to be
[41:51] instead of
[41:52] but brother branham was telling us that
[41:54] in the mind of god
[41:56] you never were lost
[42:01] because remember the picture i told you
[42:02] that god took of you that's an eternal
[42:04] picture
[42:06] but see remember he didn't take a
[42:08] picture of everybody in the world
[42:10] i i don't think brother brown ever said
[42:12] that
[42:14] but he took a picture of a special group
[42:16] of people
[42:17] you say not polaroid no remember the
[42:19] mind of god's eternal
[42:21] glory that genesis 1 26 man
[42:24] developed and we had to come down here
[42:28] for those of you that don't know there
[42:30] used to be a negative when we took
[42:32] pictures
[42:35] you had to go
[42:39] right and the young people are going why
[42:42] snap sim card what are you talking about
[42:46] there used to be there used to be
[42:47] physical roles
[42:49] that you had to put in the camera you
[42:51] know they're coming back with those
[42:52] things now
[42:53] uh deanna's got a polaroid one of those
[42:55] insta
[42:56] a retro but it's you take a picture and
[42:59] the pictures pops out
[43:03] do they now still grief
[43:07] but that was all from back then though
[43:09] because you know kodak was just
[43:10] you had to you had to send all your film
[43:12] in with this i'm making a point here
[43:14] you had to send all your film in well
[43:16] god don't have to send film in
[43:18] god wants to had the first
[43:20] digitalization
[43:22] of pictures before man ever had it right
[43:24] he didn't need to go
[43:26] well i think sam that that's not sam
[43:27] dale what's going on what's that
[43:28] somebody who is that who's that
[43:30] no he had it all right there right
[43:33] in his infinite mind it just just popped
[43:36] up
[43:38] amen but remember because of the fall
[43:42] we had to come as a negative right
[43:46] and we could get older in that negative
[43:49] form
[43:50] but you can't get older in that positive
[43:52] form
[43:54] because when god took that picture
[43:55] remember brother brown says light has to
[43:57] strike the lens
[43:59] oh come on people genesis 1 26 it struck
[44:02] that lens and when it struck that lens
[44:05] that's you amen every
[44:08] child that god was going to have boom
[44:10] right there he was
[44:12] and he's got him in an album now you
[44:14] don't have to flip through no his album
[44:16] is right here
[44:18] this is god's album he doesn't need to
[44:21] look at the picture he didn't
[44:22] he doesn't need to go back into review
[44:24] right
[44:27] but we had to come to negative form
[44:29] though
[44:30] and we had to be go through a process
[44:33] we did that in school one time i still
[44:35] got some of the pictures
[44:36] stinking oh the the anybody ever done it
[44:41] stinks don't i mean the the chemicals
[44:43] you had to put together
[44:46] but you sloshed it you're going put
[44:48] paper and water
[44:50] yep you got to put that paper in the
[44:52] water and you got to slosh it
[44:53] and all of a sudden have you you've seen
[44:55] it what happens
[44:57] all of a sudden you start seeing a
[44:59] little bit of image
[45:01] then it gets clearer and clearer and
[45:04] you're sitting there doing it in that
[45:05] chemical
[45:06] and finally when you hold it up like
[45:07] this boom
[45:09] there's your picture well see that god
[45:11] had to wait
[45:13] he always had the picture but god had to
[45:17] wait till the day that you
[45:18] asked him to give you the baptism of the
[45:20] holy ghost
[45:22] and when he did he threw that negative
[45:24] in the trash can
[45:26] he took his eternal sd card
[45:30] stuck it in there and said that's what
[45:32] you look like now
[45:34] inside we're young again
[45:40] how'd i get off on that all right so
[45:43] anyway
[45:43] number three because look everything
[45:45] god's done the devil's made a substitute
[45:47] for it
[45:48] so god allowed satan to have this
[45:50] negative picture of us
[45:53] i'm going to stay on that for a minute
[45:54] because it's true this is a negative
[45:56] picture brother brown said
[45:57] brother brown said though it's got to be
[45:58] a positive though
[46:02] it's got to be a positive it's got to go
[46:04] to something
[46:05] you can't just pull a bunch of negatives
[46:07] up and say i can't make a picture of
[46:08] that no if you've got the negative
[46:11] you can make that picture you can
[46:14] develop that picture
[46:16] glory the problem with satan is is satan
[46:20] can't do that he can't
[46:23] say that's my subject and that's the way
[46:26] he's going to look for an eternity
[46:29] no they're going to all fall they're all
[46:30] going to die
[46:32] and they're all just going to vanish
[46:36] to me that's the worst thing to know
[46:38] than to be burning in hell
[46:40] even if you could burn for an eternity
[46:42] is to know
[46:43] that one day any purpose you had on this
[46:48] life i don't care if you
[46:50] the richest person in the world if
[46:52] you're not born again
[46:54] you're going to your name will evaporate
[46:57] from history
[46:59] think about that but if you're born
[47:01] again
[47:03] your name just begun down here right
[47:06] but it always was up there and it's
[47:08] going to something
[47:10] that's eternal so don't worry about the
[47:13] negative yeah those negative pictures i
[47:16] you know you keep taking these yearly
[47:17] pictures and you go
[47:19] my hair really gets that gray in a year
[47:22] god don't see that god's just waiting on
[47:24] the other end he said
[47:26] this is what i'm looking at and you know
[47:29] what that image came from
[47:31] that image came from the word that you
[47:33] are
[47:36] that image came from the word that you
[47:38] are that word that you
[47:40] are becoming brother brown said word
[47:42] upon word
[47:49] i hope it helps you sure it helps me
[47:50] gives me a positive look at everything
[47:53] a little more than we usually are number
[47:54] three i told
[47:56] a mama the other day i said
[47:59] this is the only period of time in our
[48:01] life that we like negatives
[48:06] one more time this is the only time
[48:08] during this corona virus
[48:12] that you don't want to be a positive you
[48:15] want to be negative
[48:17] because me and somebody was talking the
[48:18] other day and they kept saying positive
[48:20] i said you're you're
[48:21] you don't want to be positive in this
[48:22] aspect you want to be negative
[48:25] all right so we don't want we want to
[48:27] stay on the positive side
[48:29] look everything that god has done the
[48:32] devil's made a substitute for it
[48:34] made something bogus see that's the
[48:38] reason the two spirits in the last days
[48:41] come right along be formal and fun
[48:44] fundamental they miss the spirit
[48:48] altogether
[48:51] you see like that and some of these on
[48:54] the radical side go plumb off into isms
[48:56] with it
[48:58] but right in the middle of the road runs
[49:00] the true
[49:01] church of god standing in and full of
[49:04] the power of god
[49:06] that's where it's at right
[49:09] so you got your radicals over here signs
[49:11] and wonder seekers and all these
[49:12] different ones that wanna
[49:14] this this or whatever this is put it and
[49:16] then there's some over here that says
[49:19] why can't we be in the middle why can't
[49:21] we have it all
[49:22] amen have signs and wonders but have the
[49:25] pure unadulterated word of god
[49:27] amen why can't we have that and we do
[49:30] watch this right here
[49:31] this one is a good one
[49:34] this is demonology religious realm
[49:39] 1953.
[49:41] you know there's false there's a true
[49:44] and the faults of everything
[49:46] if i give you a dollar and i say this is
[49:48] a good dollar
[49:50] you'd look at it i'd have to look pretty
[49:52] much it have to look pretty much like a
[49:54] real dollar
[49:55] or you wouldn't believe it is that right
[49:59] so it'll have to be really a good
[50:02] imitation because if i get like
[50:06] a counterfeiter would you know i'd give
[50:08] you a twenty dollar bill
[50:09] and who's gonna tweet all about andrew
[50:11] jackson
[50:12] is it andrew jackson thank you brother
[50:14] louise you're the only one can afford 20
[50:16] dollar bill
[50:17] i got lincoln's and you got benjamin
[50:21] franklin
[50:22] but no if i had no look but you you've
[50:24] all your life you've looked at this
[50:26] this certain bill 20 dollar bill and
[50:28] andrew jackson's head's been right here
[50:30] well if i hand you a 20 bill and say oh
[50:34] brother donny this is a good one
[50:35] and his head's upside down
[50:38] or george bush is on it
[50:42] see you know immediately that's not
[50:45] right
[50:46] but now true counterfeiters how many of
[50:48] them pass
[50:49] right now in our in our monetary system
[50:52] how many of them pass and they're almost
[50:55] 100
[50:57] imitation you know what that means that
[51:00] means that
[51:00] satan is now almost 100
[51:04] imitation because if i handed brother
[51:06] zach that money and and he takes and
[51:08] goes
[51:09] well this is this is false andrew
[51:12] jackson's upside down or
[51:13] george bush is on the front no you're
[51:16] gonna take it and go
[51:17] man this is exactly like the 20 bill in
[51:19] my pocket
[51:20] this is exactly watermark everything
[51:23] it's all good
[51:24] that's what we're facing today
[51:28] the two spirits are so close
[51:31] even being a counterfeit
[51:34] which makes it totally false because you
[51:37] know how much of
[51:38] a counterfeit bill is worth
[51:43] zero i don't care if it's got a hundred
[51:46] or a thousand or a million it's worth
[51:47] zero but the real one is worth
[51:51] the face value that's on that why
[51:53] because it's got something to back it up
[51:55] listen we've got something today
[51:56] to back up what we have
[52:01] not counterfeit we don't even have to
[52:04] worry
[52:05] if i give zach a word of god he says
[52:08] that ain't nothing but truth
[52:11] check it out though check it out though
[52:16] you think satan's going to say now hear
[52:18] something from me
[52:20] no he's going to be your brother
[52:24] i started to say he's going to be your
[52:25] daddy but
[52:28] hey bob all right
[52:33] it'll have to be a really good imitation
[52:34] and if jesus said the two spirits in the
[52:36] last days
[52:37] would be so close to it would deceive
[52:39] the very elective possible
[52:41] look religious people now remember now
[52:45] there ain't
[52:46] nothing i like that there ain't nothing
[52:50] out there in them
[52:51] old cold old cold formal outside
[52:55] they have just a form of godliness he's
[52:58] being pretty strict there in 1953.
[53:01] you see but these two spirits are real
[53:05] spirits
[53:08] they're real you say brother wait you
[53:11] just said one was fault
[53:13] it's a real false spirit
[53:18] you see but these two spirits are real
[53:20] spirits it'd be so close
[53:22] until they deceived the very elect how
[53:25] it was working
[53:26] side by side look in the last
[53:29] days did jesus say that
[53:32] he did all right let's look here
[53:36] i wrote myself a note to stop here for a
[53:38] minute because look
[53:42] there was not a requirement of full
[53:46] maturity in any age but this one
[53:49] because we're going to read a a pretty
[53:51] long quote here from the seed it's not
[53:52] there with shut
[53:54] where we go through and we've been
[53:55] through it many times before but i want
[53:57] you to look at it as the two spirits
[53:59] because because luther there was an
[54:01] antichrist spirit come up in luther's
[54:03] time
[54:03] but it was just two shoots so the
[54:06] antichrist spirit was twins so it was in
[54:10] baby farm
[54:12] okay and luther dealt with that
[54:17] but he allowed some of it to creep in
[54:23] jesus or or the the the
[54:26] light christ-like spirit never taught a
[54:29] water baptism in the name of father son
[54:31] holy ghost because it was
[54:32] anti-word
[54:35] but because it was in a baby form god
[54:38] allowed them to work together
[54:40] now you just don't have to believe me
[54:41] because i'm telling you
[54:44] martin luther was a trinitarian and
[54:46] people got born again under that
[54:48] trinitarian doctrine
[54:49] of that day not now
[54:53] of that day there was a bride that got
[54:56] birthed by one i'm going to say this one
[55:00] scripture the just
[55:01] shall live by faith they came out of
[55:03] that catholic church
[55:05] and they said god we're going to live by
[55:07] faith
[55:08] and we're going to start reading the
[55:09] bible because remember they took the
[55:11] bibles away we're going to start reading
[55:12] the bible we're going to start
[55:14] but they still baptized so see they were
[55:16] close
[55:18] and god couldn't pluck them up right
[55:21] because they look too close
[55:23] like i said the weed seed and there's
[55:26] one weed in my garden that looks just
[55:28] like
[55:30] and unbeknownst to me i pulled a few
[55:32] corn stalks up
[55:34] but when they were like this i put the
[55:37] hole to it
[55:38] and i cut it down because it looked like
[55:40] a weed
[55:42] but if i had to let it go on brothers
[55:43] that i'd have seen that stalk start
[55:45] making
[55:46] i said oh that's corn and that's not
[55:50] but see that's what god had to do we'll
[55:52] read this and watch as you see these two
[55:54] spirits moving up now remember
[55:56] we always go well that was the working
[55:59] of god and there was
[56:00] nothing but joy
[56:04] no satan was right in there working he
[56:07] was building his church
[56:09] he was building his doctrine
[56:12] but when it moved up to wesley he just
[56:15] moved right on
[56:16] up too oh sanctification
[56:19] i'll just the unclean spirit goes out
[56:22] here i just won't bring them back the
[56:23] same spirit that they had before
[56:25] because if i come back with the same
[56:26] spirit they're going to know who i am so
[56:28] i'm going to bring them another one
[56:29] right
[56:30] i'm going to bring them a religious one
[56:33] and then the pentecostals that was great
[56:37] the gifts without that coming of the
[56:40] gifts brother branham would have no
[56:41] platform to stand on
[56:44] right he would have no platform but
[56:47] since he was
[56:48] a part of that pentecostal movement
[56:52] and they believed in signs and wonders
[56:55] well my
[56:55] you know that was just but now what
[56:57] happened
[56:59] that platform stayed right here that
[57:02] platform stayed right there
[57:04] they had faith they were born again they
[57:06] got born again under
[57:08] the pentecostal message of 1906 in the
[57:11] different in azusa street right
[57:13] that wasn't false that was the holy
[57:15] ghost but what did the holy ghost fall
[57:17] on
[57:18] it fell on the word that they held
[57:21] it fell on the word that they knew
[57:25] and some of them were trinitarians
[57:29] god winked at their ignorance but really
[57:31] that but see you've got to really see
[57:32] though that satan was right there
[57:35] and god allowed that to happen because
[57:37] you know what god had told them
[57:39] when jesus christ was on earth he said
[57:41] leave them alone
[57:44] let them mature that's folks what me and
[57:47] you are facing today we're not facing
[57:50] baby demons we're not facing
[57:53] baby satan
[57:56] we're facing a full mature fixing to be
[58:00] an incarnate spirit in a man
[58:06] that's what we're facing now remember we
[58:09] don't see that
[58:11] when satan incarnates a man we don't see
[58:13] that we're gone remember
[58:14] all right but we do see the workings of
[58:17] it you see it right now
[58:19] and i want us to be that when we go back
[58:21] to the beginning
[58:22] we can see the characteristic and we can
[58:25] know what to expect
[58:29] you don't have to name names it's
[58:30] characteristic that we look at
[58:33] because i look at the corn and i see the
[58:36] tassel
[58:38] then all of a sudden here's an ear pops
[58:40] out on one side
[58:41] here's an ear pumps on the other side
[58:43] here's some silk how do i know that's
[58:45] corn i can't see the corn seed
[58:49] it's covered right right
[58:53] but it's in there working
[58:56] and by the characteristics i know that
[58:58] that's corn
[59:00] but what happens when it matures that's
[59:03] when you pull back the
[59:04] shuck and you can see the seed
[59:07] and you go aha it was corn all along
[59:12] but it now it's mature corn it's a
[59:15] maturity that
[59:16] and we preach maturity here but we've
[59:18] got to be able to stand on that maturity
[59:20] folks
[59:22] because that mature that mature
[59:24] antichrist spirit is standing here too
[59:28] a mature one not a baby one because god
[59:32] winked at the baby ignorance of them
[59:34] right he don't wink at our ignorance now
[59:38] no when the seals came open when the
[59:40] book came open
[59:43] all your everything had to go
[59:47] remember brother brown said it all ever
[59:48] from there all the way up to marriage
[59:50] and divorce he said i'm losing thousands
[59:52] of friends
[59:53] i'm only preaching in a trailer with 25
[59:55] or 30 people
[59:56] this man packed hundreds of thousands of
[59:58] people
[1:00:00] but they were there for the fishes and
[1:00:01] the loaves they were not there for the
[1:00:04] meat of the word you and i
[1:00:05] listen they were not ready for it but
[1:00:08] you and i are ready for it
[1:00:11] you and i are ready for it because even
[1:00:14] brother branham's gonna say right here
[1:00:15] i'm gonna read this
[1:00:18] excuse me seed is not there with the
[1:00:20] show let's read this and i think we may
[1:00:22] just stop right here
[1:00:23] get out of here a little bit early and
[1:00:25] then i can give me something else to do
[1:00:26] for sunday
[1:00:28] seed is not air with a shot my brother
[1:00:30] dale just covered this so it shouldn't
[1:00:31] be
[1:00:32] it shouldn't be foreign to you remember
[1:00:35] there was no more seed promised through
[1:00:37] a woman
[1:00:38] anywhere after mary
[1:00:41] and there is no more denominations
[1:00:43] promised after
[1:00:44] pentecost so it really doesn't matter
[1:00:47] what come up but
[1:00:48] from pentecostal today all these worship
[1:00:51] centers and all these different
[1:00:52] uh what do they call them now they call
[1:00:54] them
[1:00:56] what community churches are they caught
[1:01:00] they're not even baptists of methodists
[1:01:01] anymore you know our
[1:01:04] our river of life 12 stone
[1:01:12] they have a name that they call but
[1:01:13] they're dead
[1:01:15] i'm sorry but they are dead seed is not
[1:01:18] air with a shuck
[1:01:20] watch and there is no more denominations
[1:01:22] promised after pentecost
[1:01:24] now see this is way i want to skip way
[1:01:26] ahead because we're going to go way back
[1:01:28] but this is the culmination of what
[1:01:31] happened
[1:01:32] way back in before time ever started
[1:01:37] watch it's the rapture
[1:01:40] and bride coming forth from there
[1:01:43] from what from the denominations the
[1:01:46] seed
[1:01:46] the word made manifest again notice
[1:01:49] see how close it looks matthew said
[1:01:52] saint matthew 24 24 said
[1:01:54] that the two spirits in the last days
[1:01:56] the church
[1:01:57] spirit of the church people listen and
[1:02:00] the bride spirit of the bride people
[1:02:03] there's your two differences right let's
[1:02:06] don't name them
[1:02:09] let's don't name them but it's a spirit
[1:02:11] and they're covered under that spirit
[1:02:14] i'm telling you listen if we believe
[1:02:15] what brother brown said you got to
[1:02:17] believe
[1:02:17] that right there the church spirit of
[1:02:19] the church people
[1:02:21] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[1:02:24] would be so close together till it would
[1:02:27] deceive the very elect
[1:02:29] if it was possible that's how close
[1:02:33] look how it come through the stalk now
[1:02:35] notice we're going to type something
[1:02:36] here
[1:02:37] luther and the church age are bringing
[1:02:39] forth the bride's seed
[1:02:43] listen folks when the seed was planted
[1:02:45] it's bright seed
[1:02:47] this plant is bright even when
[1:02:51] even when he preached the restoration of
[1:02:53] the bride tree that wasn't bringing a
[1:02:55] new tree
[1:02:56] it was restoring the tree that had been
[1:02:59] eat
[1:03:00] the life had went down in the roots and
[1:03:02] then all of a sudden the s-o-n
[1:03:04] started shining and it brought what two
[1:03:06] shoots
[1:03:08] martin luther the just shall live by
[1:03:09] faith
[1:03:11] but did it stay there can't pull corn
[1:03:13] from that
[1:03:15] can't pull wheat from that can't get a
[1:03:17] mater or tater from it
[1:03:20] but you gotta let it white mature
[1:03:24] we've come this is mature time that's
[1:03:27] how close look how it was came from the
[1:03:28] stalk now notice we're going to type
[1:03:30] something here
[1:03:31] luther in the church age of bringing
[1:03:32] forth the bride seed
[1:03:34] was the same in spirit just
[1:03:38] one little grain of seed luther stood
[1:03:41] out on
[1:03:44] so that's no fault that's true seed
[1:03:48] got it luther was not false now the
[1:03:50] doctrine that came after luther is what
[1:03:52] was false
[1:03:53] if i got that say amen it wasn't luther
[1:03:56] that denominated
[1:03:58] no it was the people after that who has
[1:04:01] denominated the people this message
[1:04:02] brother branham no the people after
[1:04:05] the messengers already went off the
[1:04:07] scene luther stood out that was
[1:04:09] justification by faith he was the very
[1:04:12] type of hagar the stalk
[1:04:15] hagar oh my god yeah
[1:04:19] hagar the stalk
[1:04:22] anybody got that notice wesley was type
[1:04:26] of sarah
[1:04:28] the philadelphian the age of love that
[1:04:30] brought forth the tassel that was wesley
[1:04:33] right there all right i got it
[1:04:35] philadelphia age
[1:04:36] that was wesley now watch age of love
[1:04:40] that brought forth the tassel that was a
[1:04:42] wesley's age
[1:04:43] that was there was more missionaries
[1:04:45] than any other age we've had the great
[1:04:47] missionary age of john wesley's
[1:04:50] time what the seed was growing
[1:04:53] right but pentecost represented mary
[1:04:57] mary the last stage of it now she was
[1:05:00] not the seed
[1:05:02] marion herself was lost
[1:05:07] until she got the new birth even though
[1:05:10] she carried the seed
[1:05:12] of god inside of her the christ child
[1:05:17] she was lost until she got
[1:05:21] brother brown said she had to go to the
[1:05:22] upper room thank god the bible said mary
[1:05:25] was among the 120. the bible tells us
[1:05:28] that mary went to the upper room
[1:05:30] why she needed to go if she was the seed
[1:05:32] she had to become
[1:05:33] seed oh she was she was she she was seed
[1:05:37] from the
[1:05:38] yeah in god's mind she was seed from the
[1:05:40] beginning
[1:05:41] but she had to go through a process and
[1:05:42] had to go to the upper room to stream
[1:05:44] the holy ghost
[1:05:45] and she literally produced the christ
[1:05:47] child her body did right
[1:05:50] but didn't produce the life god produced
[1:05:53] the life
[1:05:54] same way with all of us god has to
[1:05:57] produce the life
[1:05:58] now watch but then
[1:06:02] where am i at pentecost represented mary
[1:06:04] mary the last stage of it now she was
[1:06:06] not the seed
[1:06:07] yet the life of the seed was in her
[1:06:11] but it hadn't matured yet
[1:06:14] the life of the seed was in pentecost it
[1:06:16] just had not matured they were babbling
[1:06:18] pentecostal babies they stayed where
[1:06:20] they was at they said well this is it
[1:06:22] we've got it
[1:06:22] this is the latter rain this is the last
[1:06:25] of it this is the outpouring of god the
[1:06:27] holy ghost
[1:06:28] but if you don't speak in tongues you
[1:06:29] ain't got it now see they come out of
[1:06:31] the bible from that
[1:06:33] they come out of the word of god when
[1:06:34] they said this is it
[1:06:36] if you don't speak in tongues you ain't
[1:06:38] got the holy ghost now that's what uh
[1:06:39] not what the bible says
[1:06:40] right all right so then what did god do
[1:06:44] cut them off and moved on right just
[1:06:47] like this right here watch
[1:06:49] i feel very religious it hadn't matured
[1:06:52] yet why
[1:06:53] why'd he say he felt religious he knew
[1:06:56] he was bringing the message of maturity
[1:07:02] and i don't say i i'm going to ask him
[1:07:04] this when i get on the other side but
[1:07:05] i know one thing's for sure i think he
[1:07:07] got tired of them pentecostal babies
[1:07:12] remember he the quran quote says
[1:07:13] everybody somebody's got a song
[1:07:15] somebody's got a
[1:07:16] word somebody you know you can't even
[1:07:18] preach because somebody jumps up and
[1:07:19] starts speaking in tongues and
[1:07:21] he had to put all that in order told one
[1:07:24] lady sit down and shut up
[1:07:27] quench the spirit no she was out of the
[1:07:29] word now it may have been god didn't
[1:07:31] anointed her i don't know but remember
[1:07:33] when he went into that service
[1:07:35] and one brother was speaking in tongues
[1:07:37] and another was interpreted
[1:07:38] brother branham by discernment knew that
[1:07:40] that was the right
[1:07:42] correct discernment
[1:07:45] but when he shook this one's hand and
[1:07:47] discerned this one spirit
[1:07:49] he had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:52] went over here and shook hands with the
[1:07:53] other guy that did the interpreting
[1:07:55] and he was committing adultery living
[1:07:58] with another woman
[1:08:01] he said remember he went up to the cave
[1:08:02] and he said god
[1:08:04] something something ain't right
[1:08:08] i perceive that was the holy ghost that
[1:08:10] fell
[1:08:11] because see the so the so the anointing
[1:08:13] of the holy ghost fell on the good guy
[1:08:15] and the same anointing of the holy ghost
[1:08:18] fell on the bad guy
[1:08:22] look how close that is now in a
[1:08:24] congregation
[1:08:26] who would have caught it oh no that
[1:08:29] brother over there buddy
[1:08:31] he got the holy ghost because he
[1:08:33] interpreted that thing right down to the
[1:08:34] point
[1:08:35] then we had to have a prophet come on
[1:08:37] the scene
[1:08:38] and discern because he brought the word
[1:08:43] and the word was the discerner two-edged
[1:08:46] sword goes
[1:08:47] cut in cuts out he had to go in there
[1:08:48] and cut that thing
[1:08:50] i'm wondering if that guy ever sat in
[1:08:52] the service and listened to brother
[1:08:54] branham and brother brown didn't know he
[1:08:55] was in the service
[1:08:57] he probably was going
[1:09:01] why because he had been discerned and
[1:09:03] that's what the word does the word
[1:09:05] discerns
[1:09:06] and will discern the two spirits
[1:09:09] i'm gonna read that quote before we
[1:09:10] leave but let's get to this
[1:09:13] it was there but it didn't mature yet it
[1:09:15] was there but it wasn't mature
[1:09:17] so is it with our pentecostal age that
[1:09:19] we're living in
[1:09:21] there has got to come forth a word of
[1:09:25] god
[1:09:25] that's inner undenominational
[1:09:29] outside of the realms of that
[1:09:30] denomination
[1:09:32] luther went to husk with his first word
[1:09:34] the just shall live by faith
[1:09:36] wesley had two words sanctification now
[1:09:38] you say where's those two words
[1:09:39] clean and set aside for service that's
[1:09:41] what sanctification means all right he
[1:09:42] wasn't wrong when he said two words
[1:09:44] and he said sanctification second
[1:09:46] definite work of grace
[1:09:48] pentecost had the third word the
[1:09:50] restoration of the gifts
[1:09:51] but the entire seed has to come
[1:09:56] forth
[1:09:59] see how they denominated on one word and
[1:10:02] another word
[1:10:03] and another word but there's got to be
[1:10:07] look capital s
[1:10:10] something that cannot be denominated
[1:10:14] it's the entirety of the life that's in
[1:10:17] there
[1:10:19] look the entirety of the life that's in
[1:10:23] there
[1:10:24] has to produce itself again on a bride
[1:10:29] there cannot be any more church ages
[1:10:32] after this
[1:10:33] we're at the end brothers and sisters
[1:10:36] we're here
[1:10:38] we've arrived that was in 1965.
[1:10:44] how far along are we now or should be
[1:10:48] we've arrived you know why he said we've
[1:10:50] arrived because when he come to that
[1:10:52] right there the seed is not there with a
[1:10:53] shuck
[1:10:54] he knew that right there was that
[1:10:56] separating time
[1:10:58] now he may not have knew that he was
[1:11:00] going to be had done passed off the
[1:11:01] scene a year from then
[1:11:03] but he knew his message was coming to an
[1:11:05] end
[1:11:07] and that the people was going to have to
[1:11:08] catch the message and take it on
[1:11:11] all right but there's got to be
[1:11:13] something that cannot be denominated
[1:11:16] it's the entirety of the life that's in
[1:11:18] there
[1:11:20] has to produce itself again on the bride
[1:11:22] there cannot be any more church ages
[1:11:24] after this we're at the end brothers and
[1:11:26] sisters we're here
[1:11:27] we've arrived thanks be to god amen
[1:11:31] now we see these things are just as true
[1:11:33] as they can be
[1:11:41] let's look let's do this right here god
[1:11:42] of this evil age
[1:11:45] i want you to look
[1:11:48] the two spirits one of them's
[1:11:51] god's holy spirit the other one the
[1:11:54] devil spirit
[1:11:55] working in deception the people of the
[1:11:58] earth are now making their choice
[1:12:00] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[1:12:02] bride for christ
[1:12:04] see this thing this antichrist is not
[1:12:06] hindering christ
[1:12:08] he's going to have his pic his kids i
[1:12:11] was thinking today
[1:12:12] you know the bible says the footsteps of
[1:12:14] the righteous
[1:12:15] are ordered of the lord and and i take
[1:12:18] for example
[1:12:19] um brother richards dad
[1:12:22] brother dale roberts
[1:12:26] i'm just going to say it people out in
[1:12:28] the world can die
[1:12:32] and god don't control that
[1:12:38] but if dale roberts is a born-again son
[1:12:40] of god which i believe he is
[1:12:42] he's got to fulfill a certain time
[1:12:46] it don't matter what men you do it don't
[1:12:49] matter what the doctors do
[1:12:50] it don't matter what anything that he
[1:12:52] has got a certain walk
[1:12:54] he's got to fulfill because he's part of
[1:12:56] god
[1:12:57] all these other people out here look
[1:13:01] and i said something the other day and
[1:13:02] i'm sorry i said it i said god don't
[1:13:04] care about anybody but the bride
[1:13:06] he cares about the whole world but he
[1:13:07] does not get any praise
[1:13:09] back from a certain group of people that
[1:13:12] he does from us
[1:13:13] and he wants what praise and worship
[1:13:16] he's god he's our creator
[1:13:19] that's how we're connected
[1:13:22] and those people can be just as
[1:13:24] connected but if he don't have that
[1:13:25] picture
[1:13:26] right if he don't see that you came to a
[1:13:29] day that you was tired
[1:13:31] of being tired
[1:13:34] like dave ramsey said being sick and
[1:13:36] tired of being sick and tired
[1:13:40] and you said god i'm not going any
[1:13:41] further until you fill me with the
[1:13:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:45] i can't go any further so as the
[1:13:47] footsteps of the righteous or order of
[1:13:49] the lord
[1:13:50] you can't go until god has
[1:13:54] solved the whole thing because you're
[1:13:56] his chip you're as children
[1:13:58] brother dale roberts is his children it
[1:14:00] doesn't matter they can pull everything
[1:14:01] in the world off they want to
[1:14:02] they can shoot him with poison it does
[1:14:04] not matter if he's an elective god this
[1:14:06] is just me
[1:14:10] he'll take care of you but he'll see
[1:14:12] that you've got to fulfill a certain
[1:14:13] section
[1:14:16] of what the mind of god saw before the
[1:14:17] foundation of the world you've got to
[1:14:19] fulfill that
[1:14:21] now you say well i'll just go out there
[1:14:23] and stand in the road
[1:14:25] he saw you do that he said stupid
[1:14:32] but you'll never go until you're
[1:14:34] fulfilled everything that god sees of
[1:14:36] that child that you are
[1:14:38] no way i just think about that today
[1:14:42] you can pull plugs whatever you want to
[1:14:43] do it doesn't matter
[1:14:45] but now see and you say oh you're being
[1:14:48] insensitive
[1:14:49] listen we're the children of god don't
[1:14:51] you take care of your children better
[1:14:52] than you take care of somebody else's
[1:14:54] kids
[1:14:54] especially the devils don't you take
[1:14:58] care of your kids
[1:15:00] well god almighty takes care of his kids
[1:15:04] it's not that he don't care about the
[1:15:06] world the world don't care about him
[1:15:10] and therefore
[1:15:13] they never had a picture they never had
[1:15:17] a scripture
[1:15:18] that they coincided with they never had
[1:15:21] a scripture
[1:15:22] that came from negative to positive
[1:15:25] because this this is the word of god
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:28] this is where you got your positive
[1:15:30] picture
[1:15:32] your negative picture came from your mom
[1:15:34] and daddy
[1:15:35] but it's got to fit this word right here
[1:15:39] so you've got a certain journey to
[1:15:42] fulfill
[1:15:43] brother ron spencer should have died two
[1:15:45] months ago
[1:15:47] they gave him four months to live six
[1:15:49] months ago
[1:15:50] i said oh boy i don't care what they say
[1:15:54] until he fulfills his step
[1:15:57] of what he needs to fulfill they can
[1:16:00] and see if you'll see it that way if you
[1:16:02] and i'll start seeing it that way
[1:16:05] that's what's going to walk us into a
[1:16:06] body change
[1:16:10] natural healing is wonderful spiritual
[1:16:12] healing we've already got if you're born
[1:16:14] again
[1:16:17] but if you see
[1:16:20] like he sees
[1:16:26] then you will see yourself projected in
[1:16:29] a body change
[1:16:30] don't matter how long it takes that lady
[1:16:33] was 90 something years old that he saw
[1:16:35] on
[1:16:36] over on the curtain across the curtain
[1:16:38] of time 90 something years old she'd
[1:16:40] walk 90 something years without god
[1:16:42] but you know what
[1:16:46] and guardian angels was because he knew
[1:16:50] that child would call his name at 90
[1:16:52] something years old
[1:16:54] and her steps oh she might have wasn't
[1:16:57] done
[1:16:57] all kind of things in the world but when
[1:16:58] she come to that 90-something years old
[1:17:00] god said time to become positive
[1:17:04] i'm going to take you from that negative
[1:17:05] because i saw you before the foundation
[1:17:07] of the world
[1:17:08] you got on your knees and you cried out
[1:17:10] to me at 90 something years old
[1:17:12] i don't care how old you are i don't
[1:17:14] care how much
[1:17:15] breath you got left
[1:17:18] get god and then it was your breath will
[1:17:22] never go away
[1:17:23] you say oh no i'm gonna draw my last
[1:17:25] breath praise god
[1:17:27] the next breath you draw will be eternal
[1:17:34] well if that don't make you excited
[1:17:38] aaron to tell you your spoon fell out
[1:17:40] you both don't stir your soul
[1:17:42] you say oh death that's why i said i'm
[1:17:44] gonna get a sermon one day on the power
[1:17:47] of death
[1:17:49] you say oh i got scripture where the
[1:17:50] bible says death has no dominion
[1:17:52] no it doesn't it's a vehicle
[1:17:57] it's a vehicle to get you somewhere
[1:17:59] jesus had to die to give us eternal life
[1:18:02] something's got to die for you to eat
[1:18:07] we sometimes look at it the wrong way
[1:18:12] spirit of god oh if the faint look
[1:18:15] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[1:18:16] bride for christ he is doing it by
[1:18:18] vindicating his word of promise to her
[1:18:20] for this age what through the prophet's
[1:18:23] message
[1:18:24] not a false folks there's got to be a
[1:18:28] truth here
[1:18:32] if this ain't it i just really don't
[1:18:35] think there is anything besides this
[1:18:39] because this is helping all of us get to
[1:18:41] a place
[1:18:43] and it's a positive place not the
[1:18:45] negative place if the finger look if the
[1:18:47] finger is supposed to move in this age
[1:18:49] the finger will move if the foot is
[1:18:53] supposed to move in this age
[1:18:55] the foot will move see how specific he
[1:18:58] is about the age
[1:18:59] that's what i said about people living
[1:19:00] their life
[1:19:02] you're here in the right time at the
[1:19:04] right place at the right moment
[1:19:05] at the right 11th hour
[1:19:09] if the eye is to see in this age the eye
[1:19:12] will see oh come on people
[1:19:16] the spirit of god as it growed into the
[1:19:18] full
[1:19:19] stature of god is the age that we're now
[1:19:22] living in the holy spirit is here
[1:19:26] vindicating the message of the hour
[1:19:32] the message of the hour it's not a
[1:19:35] message
[1:19:36] it's the message of the hour and the
[1:19:39] holy spirit is doing this
[1:19:41] so that the people that believe god
[1:19:45] will be called out of this chaos
[1:19:48] the devil's unholy spirit is here
[1:19:52] calling his church by error
[1:19:55] as usual by perversion
[1:19:58] of the word of god now listen he's not
[1:20:00] going back in
[1:20:01] and he's not took this and said well
[1:20:04] they're all
[1:20:04] prostitutes drug addicts perverts
[1:20:08] no they're church people right
[1:20:12] i'm sorry it's the church system but if
[1:20:15] you connect yourself to the system you
[1:20:16] become part of the system
[1:20:18] all right as usual by perversion
[1:20:21] of what not of their flesh
[1:20:25] by the perversion of the word of god
[1:20:28] like he did at the beginning
[1:20:29] see it coming right back to that seed
[1:20:32] time again
[1:20:33] from eden here it is again
[1:20:37] here it is again
[1:20:42] bear with me for about one second all
[1:20:43] right exposition of the seven church
[1:20:45] ages this is the quote i wanna
[1:20:46] i want you to get this in your mind and
[1:20:48] then we'll musicians come when i get
[1:20:49] finished with this
[1:20:52] because watch i'll get right here when
[1:20:55] me and bro zach can
[1:20:58] be together now remember this
[1:21:02] everybody believe brother brown was a
[1:21:03] prophet you believe he brought us the
[1:21:05] word of god
[1:21:06] all right well i'm fixing to tell you
[1:21:07] what he's saying now remember this
[1:21:09] christ in the true church not the false
[1:21:11] church
[1:21:12] is a continuation of the book of
[1:21:15] acts what fell in the book of acts the
[1:21:18] holy ghost
[1:21:19] but the book of revelation shows that
[1:21:22] the antichrist spirit would come into
[1:21:24] the church
[1:21:25] and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:21:30] formal and powerless
[1:21:33] it exposes satan
[1:21:36] revealing his works now what's in
[1:21:39] parentheses
[1:21:39] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:21:42] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:21:44] now don't put nobody's name in there
[1:21:46] don't put no church in there but you see
[1:21:47] what they're doing
[1:21:49] they're not saying the word of god's
[1:21:50] wrong they're not saying brother adam
[1:21:52] was wrong
[1:21:55] they're twisting it one word off
[1:22:00] you can fill the church up with one word
[1:22:02] off
[1:22:04] right down to the time watch he fights
[1:22:07] it watch
[1:22:08] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:22:09] the lake of fire he fights that
[1:22:12] he cannot stand it but when you get the
[1:22:16] devil mad
[1:22:18] that's anger from way back more than
[1:22:21] your mama and your daddy ever got angry
[1:22:22] with you
[1:22:25] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:22:28] people see
[1:22:29] the people have been going through the
[1:22:30] different ages
[1:22:32] and just been lulled to sleep and
[1:22:34] they've all died
[1:22:37] this age someone has got to come
[1:22:40] to the full revelation so they can't die
[1:22:44] and if satan knows that
[1:22:47] watch he knows that if the people get
[1:22:49] the true revelation
[1:22:51] of the true church and what she
[1:22:55] is not going to be what she
[1:22:58] stands for what the word and that she
[1:23:02] can do the greater works remember
[1:23:05] more of it because it's scattered all
[1:23:06] over the country not greater than jesus
[1:23:08] but more of it she will be an invincible
[1:23:13] army right if they get a true revelation
[1:23:16] of the two spirits that's where i got my
[1:23:18] sermon from
[1:23:19] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:23:22] spirits
[1:23:22] within the framework of the message
[1:23:26] christian church it says christian
[1:23:28] church didn't it
[1:23:31] and by god's spirit and withstand the
[1:23:34] antichrist spirit
[1:23:36] satan will be powerless before her
[1:23:40] he will be as definitely toward thwarted
[1:23:42] today as when christ withstood his ever
[1:23:44] effort
[1:23:44] now why did christ withstand the devil
[1:23:47] by
[1:23:48] word of god that's all he didn't say
[1:23:53] devil you can't talk anymore no he just
[1:23:56] let him right along
[1:23:58] he said it is written
[1:24:04] you know in other words he's saying i
[1:24:05] wrote it
[1:24:07] i i wrote what i'm fixing to say to you
[1:24:09] so i know what's going to happen
[1:24:11] so why can't we have confidence with
[1:24:13] that to know that what god's wrote of us
[1:24:15] that we can just use it back to the
[1:24:17] devil
[1:24:18] all right yes satan hates
[1:24:21] revelation but we love it with true
[1:24:24] revelation in our lives the gates of
[1:24:26] hell cannot
[1:24:28] prevail against us now remember they're
[1:24:31] going to come
[1:24:34] but there's already a standard there the
[1:24:36] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:24:38] but we will prevail
[1:24:40] over them let's stand our feet
[1:24:50] if you have a chance before sunday read
[1:24:56] jude
[1:24:58] read the whole chapter of jude and watch
[1:25:00] the bible talks about ungodly men
[1:25:05] certain men not saints crept in unaware
[1:25:09] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[1:25:11] into lasciviousness
[1:25:13] and denying the only lord god
[1:25:16] you say oh we got we gotta look when all
[1:25:18] this comes it's gonna be some evil
[1:25:21] person that's gonna
[1:25:23] bear be careful it's going to be some
[1:25:26] slicker
[1:25:28] it's going to be somebody coming in
[1:25:29] rubbing your back going
[1:25:32] have you ever thought about um you know
[1:25:35] i believe that's what he did eve he said
[1:25:36] eve you know i was i kind of heard there
[1:25:39] in the garden that you're supposed to
[1:25:41] you're supposed to multiply what's your
[1:25:44] problem
[1:25:45] you got everything you need your husband
[1:25:48] bless his heart he
[1:25:49] he may he probably just don't know i
[1:25:52] i'll i'll go ahead and tell you what's
[1:25:53] going on
[1:25:54] see that's what we're going to talk
[1:25:55] about when we get in the garden of eden
[1:25:57] we're going to get down to where i
[1:25:58] believe
[1:25:58] brother branham if moses could stand
[1:26:02] there and write it
[1:26:04] he was looking at it
[1:26:08] television he was watching
[1:26:13] what happened in the garden i believe
[1:26:16] that god
[1:26:18] through the prophet bringing this
[1:26:20] revelation
[1:26:23] that's what he does we love revelation
[1:26:25] satan hates it
[1:26:26] we love revelation by revelation
[1:26:29] we can get a television view of all that
[1:26:32] that's went on
[1:26:33] right and that we can bring it right
[1:26:35] here
[1:26:36] and that we can tell each one of us be
[1:26:39] careful
[1:26:40] because this time is going to be the
[1:26:42] most deceiving time
[1:26:44] ever on the face of the earth ever not
[1:26:47] even luther not wesley not not
[1:26:49] right here but i promise you folks
[1:26:52] there's a rock
[1:26:54] there's a rock mountain that will not be
[1:26:57] moved
[1:26:58] satan's going to try to do everything he
[1:27:00] can but he cannot move
[1:27:02] the bride of jesus christ let's sing a
[1:27:05] song god bless you
[1:27:07] only two spirits so don't worry about
[1:27:09] all these others there's only two
[1:27:10] greater is he that is in me
[1:27:14] and greater is he that is in me
[1:27:19] greater is he that is in me
[1:27:23] he that is in the world
[1:27:27] satan's like a roaring lion running
[1:27:32] to and fro where is he going
[1:27:36] right here
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:43] the bible says prove every spirit try
[1:27:45] the spirits
[1:27:48] and that's what we're going to do we're
[1:27:50] going to try the spirit
[1:27:52] by the word of god
[1:27:55] not our little thoughts and ideas
[1:27:59] got to be by the word that is in me
[1:28:04] and greater is he that is in me
[1:28:08] or greater is he that is in me
[1:28:12] than he that is in the world sing it's
[1:28:15] last verse
[1:28:16] oh on the day of pentecost
[1:28:20] there's nothing satan could do he could
[1:28:23] have brought all of his imps
[1:28:25] he could have brought all of his demons
[1:28:28] he could around what brother john
[1:28:30] he could have just covered that upper
[1:28:32] room
[1:28:33] and said this ain't going to happen
[1:28:40] god never even swept one drop
[1:28:45] he said i said it and it's gonna happen
[1:28:51] why can't we believe that when the devil
[1:28:54] puts a big
[1:28:55] oh man it's just all around us dark
[1:29:00] you realize that it's only permitted
[1:29:04] by god to help you get to a place you
[1:29:08] need to be
