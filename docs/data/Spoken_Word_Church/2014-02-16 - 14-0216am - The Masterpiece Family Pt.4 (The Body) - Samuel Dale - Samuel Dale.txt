just kind of let our hair down and just you know and Richard stuck here straight up yesterday so we didn't know which way he was going but we we had a good time and we appreciate all of the doings of fixings and and everything and all of the things of you brothers and sisters that was doing it and then we had a good little group of of servers to serve us and we just sat around and just you know talk and just have a good time so we appreciate all of it all right we learned that a lot of us do not know very much about our wives and uh some of the wives don't know too much about their husbands either but uh you know I think boy and Janet come in last so you know no no it wouldn't we just can't but we did did have a good time in doing all of that but let's just pray the Lord would guide us and we'll keep doing it brother Joe will be making some things some videos of the things and if you want to watch it then you know maybe we can get it all kind of down into a thing and uh where you can view it and see and all like that so just just do that we appreciate it amen amen all right let's read our scriptures let's go right on into the word and then just try to get a thought across that the Lord would bless the reading of the word all right Hebrews 10:4 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he sath sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not in other words he' got fed up back there where this is relating back to it got fed up with it and he says your your sacrifice and offerings has become a stink in my nostrils but see then he's coming over here with Paul is relating back to that and he says something that really is fitting right he said sacrifice and offerings th would us not but a body thou Hast prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me now it looks like he was sending somebody else when it would be talking about a body thou Hast prepared me looks like you know somebody else is coming but he brings it down to the eye lo I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrific and offerings and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou would us not neither hath pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first it may he may establish the second all right let's go over to Ephesians 2 and we'll begin verse 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye are in whom ye also are builded together for inhabitation of God through the spirit you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we started a little series back about four Serv three services ago and talking about uh the prophets and what he was saying in the Masterpiece about a masterpiece family all right and uh we're covering a lot of things that he covered through there and I've asked you to read or or listen to the uh messages you know like the masterpiece the season not air with the shook uh even restoration of the Bride tree and all to where that you would know that what I'm saying is U what the prophet had to say I used to spend a lot of time putting up the quotes and we will call for some as we go along to be brought up but trying to do a little more in the line of just quoting things because you ought to be to the basis now that you can uh realize the message of the hour and as I'm saying we I'm going to cover a good many different what would be the word Avenues directions whatever you put it together of throughout those things to show that it all comes to showing one thing and that's the fall and the Regeneration of man and how God comes into being in a physical manifestation and how that it comes down all the way to where we are now we covered in one message there last Sunday uh we missed a couple of Wednesdays which is the first time we've ever missed two Wednesdays in a row because of the bad weather but we couldn't help it but last Sunday we were talking about and you might think it's odd to fit in the Masterpiece but we were talking about gifts and calling of God being without repentance all right and showing then that you know in God or in doings we tried to cover the point that uh there are gifts in the body of Christ you know non spiritual gifts and and those gifts are have to be judged even though they are gifts but they have to be judged that's right because they are in the basis and it is in the word that tells about them but they are regulated to where they have to be judged but not so with the prophets in with the fivefold ministry you don't have a regulation on that part that they have to be judged they are judged by whether the word they bring comes to pass or not all right and that way you don't just say h he's a preacher got to follow him no the prophet said if your pastor won't stay with the word what' he say get away from him that's the best way of saying it you know get away from him all right but see then that way you honor the gift amen and not the person but in those gifts that you know like the the five-fold ministry the prophets Etc that gift itself is predestinated eternally from God because it is the word Ephesians 4 talks about you know the fivefold ministry all right but now in the in the body of Christ in the nine spiritual gifts you are not regulated on the basis of things like you are with the five-fold ministry you get over into the the ministry and the prophets Etc and you find that there are regulations that they must be you know the husband one wife etc etc uh even over to a deacon but yet staying with the the gifts because it says that there are gifts and gifts are given for the perfecting of the Saints All right so then we we tried to go through that and showing the difference in it and bringing it down to where that we are but just remember as I said now the prophets don't have to stand before anybody the five-fold ministry doesn't they stand before God but the Bible says if a prophet even give you a sign and it come to pass but said if he takes you to another God what does it say get away from him it's not just a point of saying well I'm a preacher you got to follow me no Paul said follow me as I follow Christ all right the gift that was in Paul's life he said whereof I'm called amen all right then gifts and callings are without repentance it was there but yet we know that was not laying on of hands to get gifts that's Pentecostalism that doesn't work all right but when it comes down to the five-fold ministry then that five-fold Ministry is responsible for to God I answer to God not to you you know all right in that basis but then I turn back around and have to be your servant which means if I don't follow the word correctly then what do you do right go somewhere else that's the best way of saying it I mean that's way you ought to do just you get up and leave if the you know if if it's doing because that is doing it but remember honor the gift and God will honor you all right that goes in all of it I honor tongues interpretation Etc I'm not going to throw off on any of those things but I'm just going to watch it right so I honor the fivefold ministry you know and I watch that all right because if Paul said if somebody comes or either he come back himself again and said something different than what he did Galatians 1: 18 then let him be a cursed so it's not to just I said just say well I'm a preacher boy you got to take what I say don't check it with the word that's right we have the message now to be able to check whether anybody's telling the truth or not we don't have no arguments out of it we just follow it by that okay so that is the point that we were coming down to and trying to show it and as I said what I'm doing in this is trying to to just take different things and yet take and if you'll follow it you'll see what I'm talking about you'll see each message when it winds up to an end point that you can take it and just put it right in the other message and it'll follow right along it's all speaking about you and I in the basis of recognizing your day in its message okay wonderful we recognize the prophet we believe that God sent a prophet unto us you know to fulfill the scriptures but yet we know too that uh Luther had a message for his day but the people had to become what Luther said right it wasn't just to quote a message or talk about it or whatever because in that day they quoted Luther and went out and burnt churches you remember the history of it and then Luther said that well they said well that's what you wanted us to do he said I didn't say that I didn't teach to burn down the buildings what's the building got to do with it it was trying to get the people in the building converted all right but think about it now so what we're going to do today now is to try to talk about uh the scripture we just read of Hebrews 105 that a body thou Hast prepared me all right now in doing that I want you to think about it as we covered it in the message that the prophet of God on the Masterpiece covers that the prophets that the the foundation that just was put on was uh Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph you know and then the prophets built the body which was the word see not to Patriarchs they were only the Foundation part but the prophets built the body which was the word and then the head to that body came which was Jesus Christ all right the last one to do was John the Baptist in the spirit and the power of el under Malachi 3 that was to come and introduce the head right all right and he done that part all right then that would would cover you know uh of where the that you would be going all right then what we want to do this morning now is to take something and kind of think about it that a body thou Hast built me all right now see everybody wants to say well that was Jesus that's right amen we believe that but he says on the message of this day the scripture is fulfilled he says scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound Revelation all right so what speaks as we will get to in another message about two more down what speaks of the bridegroom will speak of the Bride okay so in Isaiah there uh 53 when it gets down to talking about how he was smitten the prophet says the bride is smitten if you've listened to what I've asked you to to go through and do all right but trying to see the day that we're living in amen then most people say that to recognize this day is a set of on go it's just to recognize brother randam was a prophet well all right that's wonderful but just remember in the days of the times of the prophets as they were speaking a people made manifest what was being spoken right all right so now somebody has to come along to make that message live and I wasn't the one that wrote the book about it I just try to read it and I wasn't the one who brought this message but in the Masterpiece the prophet said the bride is to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 Etc all right now you mean that we are to vindicate when he's already been Vindicated is a point of saying you know if I'm right let God come down and heal the sick he raised the dead and uh demons were cast out all kind of things happen to prove that he had the sign of the son of man which is a resurrection sign right in this last day Prophet amen but then why would brother randam say the bride is to vindicate that's it amen so that means there's something left for her right and as I said there's always got to be a people to make the message alive right Luther was preaching the just shall live by faith but the people had to make that alive because he could not have of uh done as he done unless somebody helped him you know and done what he was saying Wesley brought sanctification but yet still he not by himself the zeusa street came in with the gifts all right that was wonderful we believe in all of that because it's the word of God Amen it's the restoration of the brid tree all right and in doing that then there must be a people to make this message live and I've done been through in the message a couple prior to where brother Brandon was covering it that the bride would be the word made flesh now who is that ask John 1:14 right right right amen speaking of Jesus Christ amen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right but it means in the end time to be in a bride because there's not a physical coming in the end time of Christ to the church we meet him in the air the physical coming is the millennial Reign you know when you can see him physically we meet him in the air we're going to leave here in a Rapture and go meet him in the air because he doesn't come to Earth in a COR Corporal body you know why because we're his body right right right that's simple people say brother Dale is so deep I don't see how in the world that could be deep that's just so simple I mean it's just Simplicity I'm just saying what the prophet had to say then why don't you call him deep yeah yeah but see Church the prophets built the body all right and you can't leave out any of those little bitty Minor Prophets he had his place but neither can you put in the book of mbes Aggie's Purgatory um what is the second book of Daniel or something there is a a doing in there you can't put those in why because look what kind of a body you'd have see if you came up with some of those things that were there that you know was claimed to be written back there but if you put it in you got fungus growing out somewhere you might have him standing with his arms in his his body and his torsos or what you call it the body part legs everything play and then all at once you got some kind of a a growth going off of it well that wouldn't be the body of Christ so those things were not would not pan up with the rest of the scriptures right and that was the reason they were left out because it would have not been a building a body do you understand what I'm saying I mean that's that's a a wonderful thought or illustration is that you you can't add anything to it all right so when we get into the church ages a little bit today but when we get into the church ages in the next few messages and think about it too that you can't have just denominations here and denominations there and this here and that there and over there and just you know right because that's what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about Hebrews 10:5 what a body thou Hast prepared me you realize as the B as the Bride of Jesus Christ that we are his body amen members in particular as Paul would call it you know he's the head we don't claim to be the head we're not something different we're not all we are is just a part of the body of Christ all right and in that see then we can see it's easily to understand why brother brandom as I said the other day on that point that you know the dream or Vision or what it was they told Brother brandom the GU did said do it and in that it was spoken and said you've been given more gifts and thanks well why well he because he to end it all up well that's good that's that's all right but just remember there was no Prophet had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the New Birth the way I said it all right John was born with the holy ghost from his mother's wound but he was not in the body of Christ now come on that's scripture we that's not something that has to be played with that's scripture am the kingdom never started until the book of Acts right amen all right and see the great of of John being there and it said he was full of the Holy Ghost but why don't we go over there and say like it says about Elizabeth was full of the Holy Ghost we don't want to quote that there's another one Mary or one other of they say said they were full of the Holy Ghost well amen John was full of the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb when Mary spoke the word and said his name would be Jesus John came alive all right but he was not a born again believer that's why Jesus says the least in the kingdom is what greater than John amen is that Bible amen why don't we believe it that way amen least in the Kingdom least in the Born Again believer yes why John and him had an anointing David had an anointing he had all those things but yet look what he'd do he said where he said return un to me the joy of thy salvation Scofield even says it brother Brandon may have been quoting from him but he says he said David was on his way home from the bed with basba when he wrote that I don't feelit too good today does it you know but listen the prophets built the body which was the word of each age they were living in the last one to come was John of Malachi 3 to come to introduce The Headstone which was Christ we'll get down to a quote in a minute where the Prophet said this in the end time where we're at is the introducing of The Headstone but is it odd how everything fits so perfectly together that you had the prophets to be you had Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph to build a foundation and then you had the prophets to build a body and you had the last one which was John the Baptist to introduce Jesus Christ and who was he right in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God right amen so he introduced the word right well isn't it odd in the life days or how it's done the Bible says we'll get back to it later we build on the foundation Apostles and Prophets right so this New Testament is setting on a wonderful Foundation all right but then the ages is going to build a body and the last one to come in the Ages was what Malachi 4 through brother random right to what to introduce the word yes amen right the headstone and that that's so marvelous to me and see John introduced Christ which brought in the New Testament right brother brandom introduces Christ which will bring in the Millennium right all right I'm just stating these things we'll get back to them later but you'll see that each one of these things I'm talking about and using it it brings it to a place of expressing these things to us because it is a compound meaning and a compound Revelation what speaks of him speaks of you right that's right well that's just a little bit too much brother Dale you can't you may well I didn't say it yeah so don't blame me you blame the prophet he's one said it he's the one who said it was a compound Revelation amen all right now see now as the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus Christ the word which was a temple for God to dwell in because sacrifice and offering had become a stink in his nostrils that's right and then it was necessary that he step down in human flesh y amen right to where he could die pay the price right come forth forgive our sins right give the new birth and the things and watch after a while if we get time this morning if we don't was this evening where brother brandham says that he's a body he's got a body today and he's talking to person in a prayer line he said that's the reason you're bringing the baby to me sure amen come on that's what he said he said you're bringing the baby to me he said because he don't have a body here right but said we're his body right all right but he just try to get you to recognize who you are amen now this is not new for me folks and anybody's been around has been around long enough to know this is what I was preaching in 1970 and the other day I come right back to a place where in 1969 in Athens Georgia over the first sermon I preached in this message which is not bragging but just telling you how the Holy Spirit can keep it lined up the first message I preached was the Bride of Jesus Christ was the son of man amen and she was be the fullness of the godhead bodily of course a man that begin preaching about in the 80s about the son of man everybody flocked to it but to show you how far he went he said you say the fullness of the godhead bodily he said that's hogwash that's what he said cuz he said the third pool is only for brother brandham and Jesus Christ now that's not according to what the prophet said no so I don't care what his name is am right or who he is I just tell it like it is and they're not bragging amen why can't I tell it that's right see people think I'm exalted because I said in 1974 that we could pass the year 2026 and not break brother R's messy but nobody wants to know how come I preet in 1974 but you know we're closely getting to that age but all of these were their predictions were very popular got to be done got to be done by 73 and I got to be done by 77 I didn't want it to come where it is now but it ain't bothering me none whatsoever I didn't want that earthquake to happen that I felt the other night and some of you may be felt it the struck over in South Carolina 4.1 but the prophet said there'll be after a series of earthquakes well we don't have too many here in Georgia but that took place and I felt it I seen the water sitting on the I had a a bottle of water I looked over at Nanny to see if she was was recognizing something and and the water was just floating in that in that thing in a few minutes the phone rang and people begin to tell what was going on after a series of prophet said of earthquakes they're getting greater aren't they that's right I wouldn't have one it said that he did but I believe it don't you all right now let's get into it see Hebrews 10:5 then would be speaking of a bride that would have to bring forth the the word in the last days to be United with Christ in the resurrection a body of what he calls it a body of Believers a body of Believers that's on return in Jubilee 1962 sacrifice and offering th would have not but a body thou Hast prepared me a body of Believers a body that's been born right y right a body of Believers he goes on what house will you build me he says and Earth is my foot stol and where is the place of my rest but a body thou Hast prepared me and we are the body of Christ amen right stature of a perfect man what does he say a body thou Hast prepared me God dwell in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect Worship in God being the Tabernacle God manifesting himself the statue of a perfect man is not the stature of me and you it is the stature of Jesus Christ in you and I it's not done statue of a perfect man he says God walking in two feet in you in you a body but as I said while ago now remember what made brother bradam so great was he was a member of the body of Christ whereas the other prophets of the Old Testament were not and they there used to be some people right over here not too far from us that their Doctrine was that brother random Was An Old Testament prophet in a new testament age that's right you ever heard that one you know what I told him I said then he's a law teacher now come on he's a law teacher right but see the oh but that's just my way of seeing it okay but it's my way of saying I don't believe it that's all right because I'm looking at it from the the form of seeing what God dwelling in the stature of a perfect man in The Bride of Jesus Christ because we are his body amen and he doesn't have a body now on Earth because we're his body that's right you would mess up all of the scriptures yes you know you don't have any scriptures but I I what I believe well okay believe what you want to but when it comes down to the word don't get upset with me because I expose it right message of dedication 1962 he said how beautiful Hebrews 10:5 but a body thou Hast prepared me showing that God was going to dwell in a body right okay prepared me and when this body had been made a sacrifice so now who's he talking about Jesus Christ the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth then God came to his own body which was his bride right so no no he came to you're not getting it he came back there in flesh but the one that came back there in flesh is to come in the bride amen all right and when I talk about the the bride be in the fullness of the godhead bodily I'm not just talking about Lula Georgia neither am I talking about lady oia I'm talking about seven Church ages that's right is the fullest of the godhead bodily you can't leave them out of it they're a part of it that's where the problem has been with the people they want to say like Luther didn't have nothing West didn't have Zeus didn't have nothing well you take some wheat and you plant it and it comes up and about the time you see that head just go out there and cut it down that's what you're doing and you just let that seed fall on the ground what's it going to do it's going to right cuz we don't have no carriers no holders we'll get to that this evening we are the body of Christ for Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol and where is the place of my rest in the bride of Christ amen in the bride of Christ down through seven Church ages all right listen what he's saying not a building still on that dedication we were talking about when he says there had been 120 temples that God had was created had created was ready for dedication had all their unbelief beat out of them yeah he said and not God don't dwell in a building God dwells in the heart of his people he finds rest he said in his people so the bride down Through the Ages had been the body right so Hebrews 10:5 is speaking of the Bride as well as speaking of the groom right has the Lord spoken only to Moses he says and we are his body that's the one when he's he's in the prayer line he's talking about the little bringing you take your your baby there well then C he's his body has been received up into heaven speaking of Christ but his spirit is here and we are his body now and that's the reason you brought her to me why because he was a part of the body right right this Prophet was part of the body of Christ that's why he was greater than all of the prophets he was a born again believer and when he were talking about the bride must have the same Ministry we can see it in him all right well I just don't see nothing going on well if you'd have been here when Jesus was here you'd have said the same thing and if you'd have been here when brother randam was on the earth you'd have been like the rest of them that when he challenged them 300 ministers no yes they all got yeah we want the tapes we're going to take it to our churches he said not one of them came back so it evidently didn't believe it but listen spok of word's Original Seed Christ is the head the True Stone of God do you believe that the congregation says amen the true word the bride is the body he said you want some scriptures for that 1 Peter 2 and 1 what is that like a holy priesthood right Ephesians 5 and22 where we read is what word which is the body see we are the body of Christ he doesn't need another body right now it would mess up everything he says on the Seal of God 1954 God dwells in human hearts what a body thou Hast prepared me the Holy Ghost don't dwell in the house it dwells in the heart that's the temple amen you know now that you're the Temple of the Living God Amen build a temple build a build a church and all your faith is buildt around your temple or your church that's what he's saying yours is built around what you got it's made out of w would perseverance 62 how be it the most high don't dwell in houses made with hands but a body thou has prepared me now God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus which was the Christ meaning the anointed one and all that God was listen was in Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily then what that's what the scripture says now all that God was he poured into poured out in Christ he was Emmanuel God With Us and all that Christ was he poured out into his church the anointed ones to continue his work that his word might be might live con constantly you see what I'm talking about what speaks of him speaks to you and I that's right restoration of the brid tree God sent the Holy Spirit life of God to be in you not in a statue you are the guy that God wants to live in not a statue but in you people call Holy statues there ain't no holy statues you are God's holy statue that's the Bible says that's right a body thou has prepared me when he gets over to the Philadelphian Church age look what he says and he's not only giving crowns this is 315 Church age books what it actually is the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us and he's going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple that's right what are he going to say and God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him part of that Foundation group what is he doing he's giving him the revelation of the word of himself because that exact that's exactly what the apostles and Prophets had so we're build on the foundation Apostles and Prophets well brother d i i i I just check out what the prophet is saying by where how my spirit is you know one man years ago had it wrote on a marriage and divorce book and he said I want to ask what I would love for brother brownon something to degree to be here now where I could ask him these questions he might to state from here so I'm going to make his statement he said the Lord spoke to to him one day and he said are you going to believe your ideas and thoughts or are you going to take what my Prophet said I believe God spoke to him it's your fits don't it are you going to believe your ideas yeah but I think it's just way what right do we have to think what does the Bible say why don't we check the prophet's message with the Bible why don't we check the Bible with the prophet's message right I any problem God don't get mad at nobody for checking out his word that's right come on he revealed something to brother brandham and he said I'd spend the rest of the day checking it out what checking it out God spoke to him he said but I'd spend the rest of the day checking it out why to see whether it was right in the word a lot of voices speaking of a lot of things yeah but the Lord told me you remember where we were at when we're talking about the gifts and calling of God without repentance remember you can have a gift of Prophecy or speak just one time and never be used again because it will go from one person to another you remember that but yet you don't call a person a prophet just because they prophesy right right you know well that's a prophet he prophesied well what does he do with the rest of it right amen but you see we're built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Paul said about the foundation back there in the first church age he was talking to the Ephesians and then he reads the scripture built upon the found foundation of the Prophet Apostles and Prophets Luther no Baptist no no build on the foundation in other words make him a pillar in other words part of the foundation what will I give him Philadelphian Church age 1960 1210 what will I give him I put him in the doctrine of the Apostles and prophets from the beginning and give him the Revelation what's the prophet say about him he's counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father I'll put him back in the foundation of my word in the house of God oh my I'll put him right there in that pillar in the foundation where you stay right in the word he said I like that brother don't you right you see if we get something that is contrary to the Old Testament are you following my thought now something contrary to the Old Testament does it not say that we're built on the foundation of Apostles and Prophets is that the scripture amen it stipulates I know word an can be translated even so even the prophets amen go ahead but just remember Peter and them couldn't bring anything contrary to the Old Testament prophets they built upon what they were saying that's right amen Paul set in order the Old Testament scriptures until he being the only one that was chosen to write like like that Etc so much and was not even a personal witness to Jesus Christ right but yet no one in all of that of doing of the writings of the Apostles Peter James John Etc did any of them explain communion and yet the Apostle Paul was chosen to explain the communion in the Corinthians right why because he took that Old Testament scriptures what did the prophet say it he said he went for what 3 years back there and wouldn't even preach or nothing until I know one time you can use 14 the other time you use three he said he was checking out to see whether what spoke to him was what was back there amen and remember what he said the surprise was not the pillar of fire strike anymore came down he knew about that he knew about the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the pillar of fire and the Moses and the stories but when that Pillar of Fire said I'm Jesus that's it whom thou persecute us and Paul never did persecute Jesus is no record but he was persecuting the Christians that Christ was living in but Paul is relating it he says he is the Jehovah the old and Jesus of the new right that's right amen you said well Paul no I know Paul never said it that way that was brother brandham because he was bringing what Paul said but you see we lost down to the ages of the revelation of the original uh Apostles you know right that they were built upon what the prophets had said and they were prophets in the New Testament yes aabus Etc different ones sure John was counted as a being a prophet there were many of them that were counted but those are in fold Ministry prophets but then we're promised in the last days that God would send us a prophet amen not an Old Testament Prophet that's right no you just stay with law teaching if you done that he'd turn you cuz that's why people can't understand uh brother randam coming because they think melachi 3 is in the world will agree that melachi 3 is is John the this y I mean they'll go along with that Luke 1:17 you know they'll go along with that that it was John the Baptist but then when they come to Malachi 4 they say yeah but but he turned us right back and you remember what the prophet said John turned us to the New Testament message which was Christ he said because if he turned us back he turns back under the law amen that's the way your Prophet said it would be but what do we believe it can't be any different in the Old Testament and New Testament in revealing God why brother Rand would say he said how many gods did they have back there he said they had one he said how many gods does a bride have he said one amen one God all she's got amen not a trinity not thoughts no right he said you go to your Jews with it and tell them about that he said they tell you right quick where that come from yep he said because they know the history right of the Catholic church and where it come from you know of the Trinity but are you following me a body thou Hast prepared me so he's not going to just make a in the last days start back over it was put there as the apostles and Prophets right be the foundation and then the church AE Messengers would be the body all right and that way you can't leave anything out of it you can't leave out one of those ages but you see just because Luther smoked a pipe and sat in a pub and drank beer which we'd be totally against amen but yet the message he brought us is just shall live by faith I believe it right that's right his action and reactions might have been different because nobody was there to judge him and tell him well because he was under the Catholic church and their ways he didn't want to leave the Catholic church I've read his own writings he wanted to convert the church and he tried to convert it with ways were doing it it turned out to be why it's called Reformation Right Wesley sanctification is called Reformation why because we're trying to reform yes that's it we're not to deal with reforming see we're to deal with the word of the Lord so you and I the one God we have is the same Foundation that Paul was laying Peter was laying right right the same one God that John spoke of we speak of today yes the same one Luther I mean Luke said I really like to read the book of Luke you remember when he comes over he represents a man in the the ages and comes through with Luke Matthew Mark Luke and John and I love to read his writings you know why Luke never he was not an original disciple right come on no he didn't come along to Paul all right but Luke read what he says in the beginning he said having perfect understanding now none of the other Apostles right Matthew didn't say that Mark didn't say it John didn't say it but Luke the guy that was not even there when Jesus you know went with him and going he was writing of accounts that's right that other people told him but I don't think you could have pull some book of mccabes over on Luke do you some kind of a second book of Daniel or Aggie's purgatories or something you know right no he Luke at having perfect understanding the Holy Spirit spoke to the man and would say that's not right leave that out and look what he was coming Luke was a physician you know and he was with Paul at a wonderful way of traveling didn't he how about traveling alone with a guy like Paul that would write the basis of the New Testament you know more writings than any of them do you see what I'm talking about what we're talking about today is already been written in the word of God am yeah but but but we're in another age now were people say brother Brandon was even in another age but we're in another age now we're in the bride age there was bride age never a church age there was a bride never Church age so there's bride age never Church age right but yet we've gone beyond the prophet is what I had a man tell me I said well you need to First tell me what he said right and then we'll talk about what you're talking about he was sitting in my home you know and I finally told him I said why don't you either get in the message or get out and his wife looked at me and said brother Dale you're exactly right he needs to get in or get out he said but we we go beyond that he just laid the foundation is it okay I'm known for being a smart elic I'll accept being an elic but I ain't too smart but I said brother would you mind telling me what the seven Thunders are that's just what I ask him cuz see I knew how to trap him well he finally looked at me and he said you're the teacher why don't you tell me what it is I said even if I told you you wouldn't know what it is cu it got to be revealed to you and it certainly won't fit into your doctrine that you are to build a body well brother there you're talking about the ages built right sure and we don't need nobody to build a feet we don't need nobody to build a the loins we don't need nobody to build the legs we don't need nobody to build the chest we don't need nobody to build the arms right and we've already had the one to come to introduce the head right so we're not looking for somebody else to come to straighten this thing out right right he was either the prophet or you and I got a lot of problems all right you see I don't have no no Swiss bank account just in case this thing goes wrong you know I don't have no the old saying goes you know in financial world don't put all your eggs in the same basket cuz you can lose you know but in the Christian real you better get them all in the same basket right right CU if not you're trying to hold over something else okay now think about it John the Baptist was the one who come to introduce Jesus Christ S as we would see Jesus being the greatest prophet of all the Ages was John the Baptist and Jesus said so Vindicated him as the greatest greater than Elijah greater than any other rest of them was John because he introduced the Messiah the rest of them prophesied of his coming amen do you need that and pull it up pull up number 16 so where you can read it sir as we would see Jesus 1957 paragraph e37 look what he says as soon as he entered his Min John the Baptist one who introduced him being the greatest prophet of all the Ages was John the Baptist and Jesus said so Vindicated him as the greatest greater than Elijah greater than any of the rest of them was John because he introduced Messiah the rest of them prophesied of his coming all right but he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he had the privilege of introducing to the world the Messiah God now are you following it yes the others prophesied of his coming which would build a body but John come to introduce amen Elijah of you know going back down the other times we believe in the five comings of Elijah right Elijah Elisha uh John the Baptist number three Bachi four into our day and and the last one to be with two witnesses to the Jews all right but none of those prophets of the Old Testament introduced Christ they could only prophesy of his coming do you follow me what they said is the word of God but none of them said behold there stands a man right the only prophesied of a man that would come John the Baptist said behold let's see if I can find it I'll get to it in a minute if I don't I'll miss it it okay uh go down to 19 which is spoken words of regional seed number two 62 318 uh paragraph 441 as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God now watch the second Forerunner will probably do the same watch by pointing the people to a word born bride amen the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God will come forth from his lips God help us to be ready you see this Prophet didn't just prophesy of his coming come on you need this quote he said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here to him he was there that's right well you he we're good Baptist well he's here well how you know brother Bram said he was Oh my he said why do you say Baptist cuz that's the way we Baptist was none of you wouldn't Baptist you didn't never talk to your pastor and he says I got the Holy Ghost well how do you know it came on the day of Pentecost you didn't never talk to him you didn't never hear him say things like it I know I'm born again it came on De Pentecost well what do that got to do with it that's right prostitution went up last year does that make that okay you said you're stupid brother Dale no I just make plain statements to keep us from being so dumb brother random says I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here but you know what what he's the only man in the world at that time that could say that that's right that's true but for me to quote that don't make him here right come on that's right prach I could quote The Book of Revelation before brother random ever come to tell me what it was saying come on couldn't you come on I could quote that Jesus was God unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins and then turn around and tell you he was a third person in the Trinity oh brother Dale you not expose us like that why not being dumb is being dumb I've never been too smart I guess that's why I don't get along with people I've never been smart enough to be smart I'm just dumb enough to believe what the word of God says and to not say he's here called brother R said it you ask the people of this message to put their own Revelation in the Bible they say brother R said brother R said brother R said brother R said and you say well you not be a parakeet let me just be a parakeet that's all I want to do it's just well go ahead and be a bird you got a bird brain you know brother Dale's aggravating and hateful but you get the point don't you of how silly we are that's right and that's all I care I'll answer for those other things one day to God myself but you're going to answer for what's said the dumb donkey couldn't be nothing but a dumb donkey that's what I said in the church one time about a brother I said a dumb donkey corrected a prophet and I said a couple of dumb donkeys like the brother and I called his name of course I didn't use the word donkey yeah and they all laughed at me and I said you got the word and you got it in the wrong place I meant it like it is he was a dumb donkey and we're dumb donkeys because what we need to do is get the new birth yes sir all right that's right but do you understand John was sent we found in Matthew it wasn't so from the beginning first you know and introduced them to the Messiah he was a great prophet John between the two ages now listen between law and Grace and he preached that there was a messiah coming that was going to thoroughly Purge the floor and gather the grain all right but then see that was only prophesying right yes I'm trying to illustrate what he said while IO when I said those prophets were only prophesy when John walked out there and bringing his message he was first prophesying yes right cuz he was telling them the Messiah was coming but then one day he says Behold the Lamb of God right that was no longer prophesying he was introducing Christ Amen brother brandom started out in his years and he come down prophesying right putting together the scriptures but one day he said he's here right it was no longer prophesying anymore when are we going to get away from that when are we going to get around to what he says here off of there's a man here pull this up number 18 I'll go ahead and read down to it but pull number 18 there is a man here that can turn on the lights 1963 1229 the morning service paragraph 162 yesterday's Luther Mana would not work for Methodist Methodist Mana would not work for Pentecost Pentecostal Mana will not work for today see what I mean every day is Come Day by Day fresh watch now every day it come day by day fresh and so has it through the church ages that's it Luther's manner was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostals was the restoration of the gifts but this is introducing The Headstone the last day the bride tree oh what now now brother Brandon you sure do goof up a lot oh my but this is introducing The Headstone come on come on preach the last days the bride tree who's going to make the headstone manifest come on Amen come on we're expecting a headstone to unite it where brother Brown said one day the head and body unite and said God would do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now that's a direct quote amen 40 something years ago and I still quote it you see what I'm telling you folks this is not something new this is not something that brother Dale started preaching three weeks ago it's when I started preaching in 1970 or 69 7071 who wanted to hear it then and who wants to hear it now I don't want to hear it well that's just old Mana that's I love the man of myself so what did he say spoken words Original Seed we've reading that while ago the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus Christ screaming Behold the Lamb of God will come for for from his lips God help us to be ready for that great that near event at the appearing he said now what's the difference brother RAM on I'll think of it in a minute but I'm I'll get it uh looking at the book but I can't read the title um but he says there's a difference in the appearing and the coming you know he can appear right over there in that church today heal the sick do great things did you say well he's coming over there now I differ with you right cuz he's not trying to come over there no he's trying to come to his bride well if he' want to okay all right but there's a difference in the appearing and the coming so when brother Brandon was here he was pointing to a word born bride in other words telling about a bride that would be born by the word amen right that's in his appearing but there's a difference in his that and his coming all right what did it say on the River Jordan as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ your for your message self as as John the Baptist was sent to for forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ your message will forun the second coming right look what he says in a man here that can turn on the lights talking about the architect was so great he said they lost the he's talking about the pyramid right paragraph 102 10 I mean 101 102 they lost a headstone they don't know where it's at now when that headstone returns it'll be just like the rest of it it will blend in with the with the stone that's left open if you should put the headstone on it it have to be that way and when Jesus returns he'll find a church that's washed without spot or wrinkle and it'll be the same Ministry he had y right it'll bring back The Headstone right drop down paragraph 104 that's when C church and Christ unites together as a bride with the same spirit that was in him will be upon her when that church comes from justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost into the last days and horning her down now for the coming right of the Lord drop on down to paragraph 106 he's talking about remember how they took the rags and used to make p used to make paper out of it you know the rag it's Christ now taking the rags of yesterday the Lutheran Methodist Presbyterian and so forth and he's putting it to a process what kind of a process a process of the Holy Spirit what they had plus making it till he is pressing his own image when the church in Christ becomes one in Union God granted he says what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to do amen right throw the last one up there so messenger of Malachi 4 Church age book what does he say she's to do I mean he's to do he's to do two things right what's he to do 327 Church age book Lady of sin Church age this messenger of Malachi 4 Ruth 1730 7 Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that's not taught anymore in the message because we're well beyond all of that they don't talk about the faith of the fathers because you can't take the faith of the fathers and place these doctrines that people have in there that's right you show me where the disciples taught two Lords you show me where they taught of Jesus being just a man until River Jordan come on put two souls in a Doctrine in the Bible but we're beyond that brother well you're standing in midair because you don't have a foundation oh according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers right number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father well brother Dale tell me what the Thunders are according to the seal book he said the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal broke now that's what he had to say about it so you go ahead right that's right well then tell me his new name the prophet said maybe it'll be made known when we get there well you're just trying to buy pice well I ain't trying to buy pice I'm just trying to do one thing I'm as honest as I can be and this is Brother Dale I've never been looking for a new name because I haven't run out yet in the name of Jesus am right and I happen to know that when he appears to the two witnesses after we get out of here he'll still be Jesus and I happen to know when it comes to the white Throne he'll still be Jesus now happen to know in the Millennium it'll still be Jesus that's right if he wants to reveal a new name when we get over there in the future home that's fine with me but there's one thing about it you'll never forget that he was Jesus you can't take another name to erase Jesus that's all I've ever said amen but they Wan some kind of a rabbit in a hat trick where they could find some name like brother brandham like people back when I first came in said brother brandom's mouth was formed you know formed a certain way that he could speak that word I thought our thoughts in heaven were louder than our words on Earth I didn't know we had to be blabber Mouse for him to be able to hear us what are you doing brother Dale what am I doing I'm trying my best to preach Jesus Christ amen amen and preach Christ in The Bride As Paul said the hope of glory that's right amen he can do what he wants to but if we're not ready we can't hear what he's saying that's right how many heard what John the Baptist said right right right but how many believed what John the Baptist said that's right now I'm just pling language and I know but I want scripture where it was anybody jumped up and down screamed and hollered when John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the only thing you have John with any part he turned two or three of his disciples you remember they came to John before they put him in prison there in the script and he says in other words follow him but you see we're looking for some kind of this or that or the other I'm still looking for what I did when I came in this message and begin to see what that Prophet was talking about and I still believe it today that they without us cannot be made perfect and that day mean that they without us means everybody from here back all the way back to Adam and Eve in the garden amen that's right that's how I believe it right Hallelujah they can't be made perfect without you and me are we going to call them up and preach something to them make them perfect no you don't have to preach nothing to Luther he's going to raise Perfect Right amen that's right you don't have to have something to perfect him he's going to raise perfect or he's not going to raise come on musicians think on these things a body thou Hast prepared me the Bride of Jesus Christ is the body of almighty God upon Earth in this day and she is to vindicate Malachi for Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 that's right we're not going to prove this message to be right in the basis that that was already proven we're going to prove that what the messenger said about this right in the end time is right there's a little difference in what I just said somebody's going to take what he says and says I am the message you remember when the Welch Revival or which one it was you know and the police officer standing there you know and sir I want to know where the Revival at he said you're looking at it that's right when are we going to let it be that way when are we going to let it be the messages right here in you and I but I just don't see it that's the same thing You' have said when Jesus was here and the same thing You' have said when brother Brandon was here there's no difference this just the same different age no i' have believed it when brother Brandon was here you'd have believed it till he turned one around the corner because at 300 preachers we want the tapes brother brandom you remember he said it we want the tapes we're going to bring all of our people we going to baptize him and not one came back you know what I'd do if I'd have been sitting under one of them preachers and he done that I would have been gone somewhere else right come on go ahead what we got let's Stand Together 566 let's just sing a verse and then we go eat all through me Holy Spirit flow through me through me Holy Spirit through me as I live my hands to worship tonight magy thy name through me Holy Spirit blow through me you believe it through me love that's what that sign means isn't it I told the Lord a long time ago I said when I raised my hands I you to know that I love you brother told me he said that's too close to a worldly sign I don't care what the sign is what I told him I said that means I love you I said but the problem is is the sign you make brother he said what I said you do that all the time you're preaching I said when you're preaching you're doing that I said that is the Catholic sign of divide and conquer but you see it just because my sign now I can't raise that finger cuz it got broke but I can say I love you Lord you just whatever we want for our own benefit right your dismiss thank of the remember of service this afternoon Lord just bless everybody be with each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Lord through me Holy Spirit Lord
