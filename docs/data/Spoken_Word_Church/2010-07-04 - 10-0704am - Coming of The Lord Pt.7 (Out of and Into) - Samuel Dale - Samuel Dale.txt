to be able to live in a land where that we can until our time is now that we can have our freedom to be able to believe your word and to walk there in and Lord we realize and know that when the time comes that we will not be able to then you said you would send your spirit Among Us and raise up a standard that would take care of all things we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now as

we want to stand complete in you and guide us now in Jesus name amen Psalms 118. we've been reading from verse 19 through 26. open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thy shall for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord I beseech thee sin now prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord now let's go to Hebrews 13. we'll begin reading verse 10 through 14. we have an altar of they have no right to each which serves the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus all showed that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go therefore unto him without the count burying his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word you know to those that would be on uh it will be live internet I guess to the video but through you will when you get an opportunity you'll be able to see and a lot of people and see what I look like and behold the only day that I have done it I forgot to bring my coat so we are here as normal and looking normal I did find a tie a word that I could be able to you know look more like the the day and the time we're not people who celebrate so much on a lot of things but we do thank God for the freedom that we have right we thank God for the independence you know Independence really means the the state or fact of being free from a binding situations or subjection to situations that make you worried that you're not free and here in America it's a wonderful time because see when we started our our independence day then that was a time to worry that we were getting away from religion you know the religion of mankind and we thank God for the fact that we have had all of these years and the time that we could be to where we could could appreciate uh the Natural Freedom to do that it's cost a lot of lives of men and women around the world to pay that price that we could have freedom because Freedom never comes without them without a price it always is something that is related that's going to be a price in other words if you have freedom you're going to have to to in some way or the other pay for it because it's one of the things that man is not going to let us do we came here as the saying goes uh you know to get away from religion we didn't come here to to set up another religion or or do whatever we came here to get away from the the ways of the catholicisms and the things that was bind ending people to their ideas and thoughts and we came here for our freedom and we we certainly thank God for that amen and you know we started out here I told you we this is the beginning of our 40th year uh it fell to were the Fourth of July fell on uh the Sunday because we started here some of you may not know but we started here July the 4th uh 1971. we had a service the Sunday before down in our home there in Gillsville and but we officially started a the service here and the little old building and it was just right across where you see the beam and said all it was in a little small Nook right there you know that um was the old building but you know we we rented for many years and and everything and then was able then to purchase the building but we hope that it does not repeat today like it did before because the first service we had here July the 4th 1971 there was um four cars and a Truck a pickup truck parked up in front because we couldn't go back into the back it was all this or no hedgy stuff and you know but a man came down the highway up here and he was on prescription drugs driving a big old Cadillac and a man was trying to stop him that told us about it and that he was running about 80 or 85 mile an hour coming through here and uh so in a chain reaction he hit the vehicles and he would hit one knock it into another one hit that one knock it into another one and he hit all five he got every one of them and sitting here the wrecker had to come and pull away brother mulk's car and my car and mine was about into the middle of the chain and and when it got through it looked like an accordion because it was a Wham on both ends you know but we had to to do that in in that afternoon we all brought second cars some of them were not damaged too bad but uh brother moat we were singing conviction to dismiss and he said let's sing one more song well if it happened we would have been outside you know walking around in the front so God is with us you know we kind of laugh about it because people after then they kind of heard about what had happened and a lot of people were afraid so when they would come to services they would go up the street and maybe park somewhere else you know but the city of Lula then came and asked us could they clear off the the back back here for us to help us out you know where we could get some parking but now I preached that Sunday afternoon on the same form that I will today because I titled the message then going Beyond man's camp will preach that morning service and then I preached the afternoon service and uh calling it going Beyond man's camp and I read this scripture I think because Jesus was crucified we've been there we've seen it that's why they're arguing over the place of the actual crucifixion but if you'll take the scriptures and read it that Jesus was crucified without the camp in other words outside the city so that's where Golgotha comes in and then that's where they say that he was crucified but there is arguments over that that it was inside the city but I don't believe it because I believe the scripture because he was crucified outside of the gate now here's my point I made then and I still want to make it to you and I that wherever God is that's where we want to be right right amen right amen if he's without the gate then there shouldn't be any problem with us of realizing that's where we need to be right in other words if you went over there today to try to find him where would you find him if you went there to try to find him in Israel where would you find you'd find him outside the gate why because he was put out right he was taken outside the gate and crucified outside of the gate you know outside of the city walls and things and see that would be a a thing then let us go out unto him the scripture says right so now ever where he's at that's where I want to be and I preached that day a simple form of saying to anyone that would ever hear the message it was about 25 of us here and I preached it like this I said now we have went to church in a lot of places and we've tried to to you know do the best we could and really this church was started on the basis of not being a church it was just a building rented to where that we could call in somebody and how Services that's was our full intentions in the beginning but it developed into a church but I preached the message that day of saying now brothers and sisters we're trying to go beyond a man's Camp because that was 1971 they had already developed among the message many many counts groups groups of people you know that had settled down on the two Souls uh seventh under virtue of the perusia the no Holy Ghost doctrines all kind of things that had begun to develop you know and I said then I said you forgive us but we're going to try to go beyond man's camp because the prophet of God said said we can't you know there's a one message that I wish you would would listen to or or get it and read it is going beyond the count priest in 1964. uh 7 18 the evening service 7 19. that brother Brown talks about going Beyond man's camp and he said we we go beyond our camp of our own thinking let's go to the thinking of God so it's not our thinking because most of the time we're on so to be sure let his mind rest in us and his mind was to do the father's will let us go beyond the camp tonight Lord and find Jesus because see you're you're not going to find him in organized religion restaurant damn now I'm sorry you know I've done that then and I'm saying it now you're not going to find it an organized religion now I will preach a message later on this because he can appear there yes he can appear today and save people I believe that I believe that he can appear in a denominational church today and say people I say it's getting pretty thin about doing it maybe but still I still believe it because we never want to limit God the but when he appears there that's one thing but that's not his coming that's right that's a different thing and we'll get to that when we we do but let's go beyond man's camp and he says you'll never find him by joining the church you'll never find him by shaking hands with some minister or signing some Creed or something that we promise to do not go to church uh Sunday school and all you'll find him we'll find him in the word because he is the word amen and as we see this day promised that he's to be outside to Camp put out again now let us go beyond the camp ready to bear his reproach hated to the world but love to the one who invited us to the camp all right so we're going Beyond man's Camp that's what we were wanting to do then Beyond man's ideas trying to move on the now God has a camp God has a camp you'll hear Brothers in the same message he's talking about right he said uh let me see so you see they go beyond the camp of God's word to find their answer now God has a camp right because it's his word right right so that's where we want to go beyond man's Camp our own thoughts and I told him then I said brothers and sisters you forgive us because we're wanting to move on in the Lord what I believe God has used that and we've been able to go on but people are persuaded to their dogmas and creeds without the camp right amen without God's Camp you can't stay in God's Camp because God's Camp is going to be where the word's at the children of Israel were down in Goshen right the light was in negotiate that was where God was at was with the people but we want to go beyond our own thinking not somebody else who's that see it's not um anybody else bothering you and I it's our own thinking it's between our ears called our brain you know there's where we hear there's where we make up our minds and things and we we turn around in and we can denominate you remember what Moses done Moses smoked the rock twice you'll find it in that message he smoked a rock twice but he was only supposed to speak to it right that's right and brother Ron said when he did he set up an organization or a denominational system because he went beyond what God had told him to do amen and that's how simple and how easy it is is for us to just add to the word of God or take away from the word of God will automatically make our own camp and it doesn't matter how long or what we keep saying that they're all we're independent we're independent you know we're still the same as everybody else I've showed you here a while back you're born to an organization that's why we got to be born from you all right but see we've got to to come out all right so now let's read uh one more scripture and then we'll get into our thought looking and uh Corinthians second Corinthians excuse me second Corinthians I'm going to start with about verse 16. because I want to read this because Brother Ray and I were talking just a moment ago about it you know uh people are talking about now that all of this things that are happening the oil that's in the ocean is the tribulations and the things now it's a pre-tribulation it's not de-tribulation uh it is not the the wrath of God poured out it is the wrath of man poured out see so then we were talking about that and I wanted to read this because over in Revelations when it is 18 4 where it says come out of her my people all right brought around uses that scripture for you and I right but really that scripture is to Israel and the reality of where it's placed and what it's talking about and what it's doing it's really over there but you're in the scripture Paul picks it up in Corinthians so let's get this and then we'll get on to our thoughts from second Corinthians 6 about 16. in what agreement hath the temple of God with owls for a year the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people now watch now if we are that what is going to take place amen wherefore therefore see all right wherefore come out from among them and be your separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty all right so it's always been a coming out right amen it's always been a coming out we'll get to it in a minute that's coming out and then going into but it's always been a coming out amen all right the main thing it is we're doing is trying to come out from our own thoughts and ideas all right I'd look back and see look like we've got a visitor so we say to you welcome all right we didn't see you a moment ago or we'd already greeted you but we always say when you come here one time we say welcome you know we don't say welcome because you're part of us we don't have anything we didn't come out of the organizational systems to be able to set up a church that we could all join because that would be the same that they were doing and we haven't tried to come out of of anything other than our own ideas what somebody else says you know what somebody else teaches that's fine but if it is according to the words and we say to you welcome and and make shift at home with us all right but now listen the prophet of God ought to scan through sometimes because you know what he's talking about on to come out of her my people see he said the church has failed now listen to this one real careful because I like to read all of them so you like to get these down here that sounds and I like to read all the things he said instead of bringing the people together as one body in other words the church done it separated them because the word denomination what does it mean conquer and divide a common in in in a common denominator in in math see you you've got to get those things to divide with it all right he said just like Moses instead of speaking to the Rock he smoked the rock you see and it failed so the church will never take the people over Jordan right so that's right but now God has changed his order and he's sending back you who mark my word there's Great Men on the road to this world now listen to it that's right there's great powers on the road to this world and it'll be a people that'll call out of people but we want to make it all into brother random that's fine because he called us out but now we're calling out see he brought the point of calling us out now we've got to go on and it'll be a people that'll call out of people Remember come out of her my people is that right Babylon confusion and not the people now not out of your churches me I'm not trying to call nobody out of church either right I'm not trying to get somebody to come to this church that's your choice but here's what I'm trying to get all of us to do but come out of that confusion Among Us ing everybody else no okay then when you said that that automatically admitted you admitted you were the one that was guilty but that's the way it goes see you see come out let's serve god with one heart and one mind and one Accord is that right and then God will take his church over Jordan that's over death right Jordan was on top of death all right now come out come out of your Creeds come out of your self-style things and I'll receive you how do we come out God sent an angel a messenger to what call out come out the message of the hour see the message of this hour is calling us out of organized religion all right but it's not just now calling you and I out of the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Etc Pentecostal is calling us out of the churches because it's a it's a bride out of a church right right you know where church is used correctly because this means called out right but then there's a difference then in the church in the bride right amen see the bride is called out of the church right you're using Church correctly it's okay but then when you come down to analyze what a church is and what it consists of it consists of man's ideas and doctrines all right now we should not hear should not have any trouble with thinking about whether or not the denominations are correct we know the placing we know what you know God has used each one coming down thank God for it we believe it but now we're into the message of the hour but now it's a a bride coming out of a church right and what has that been doing what have I been trying to preach to you the coming of the Lord been taking place ever since the day of Pentecost that's the way I believe it the second coming of Jesus Christ why because it's a bride coming of Christ coming out of the church now is this doing then we've got to come out our own of her own ideas thank you well I think well that's what happened to even the gardens that was the problem with her thinking see we've got to come out of that and the message of the hour is calling you and I the prophet back there was calling us out of organized religion you know out of the denominational churches no now God is calling us out of our own ideas like brother moat used to say about a good point he said we get our coat and hat we just change meeting places well but see it's no good to just do that this is a constant coming out amen I believe in it that's what I was trying to say then that you know when we start a year 39 years ago I was trying to say we're trying to come out right we're trying to come out of all man's ideas you say well you just formed your own well I've met it I'm not no one to back up when we came out of the the other churches and started the church we were trying to do the best we could but I still believe that the problem today is between our ears right and our thoughts about what we believe that's what I want us to be born out of it and that'll take the revealed word amen all right and that's what I've tried to do brother what was one of the most wonderful teachers on don't back up never have that he was the greatest of all the teachers of this message and I'll put him against all of them and if he was still here today and preaching somewhere and everybody you name who you want to I'd still go here brother Mo preach because I believe he was trying to bring the word of God to us all right let's see bringing the word to us is one thing but then letting that word be burnt in you and I am is another thing see we've got to be that's why the scripture says being being not born again being born again we're in a constant birth we're a constant coming out amen amen we've got to come out of our own idea see called out come out see be separate saith the Lord and I'll receive you touch not their unclean things the Church of God is called out of the world out of the chaos of the world see what are we doing we can come out of the world and come right into a church and still be the same thing right because the most worldly system that there is today is what what does America consist of the biggest percentage of Americans should consist of at least some form of religious principles or ideas but yet what is all of the doing what's everything in there can you tell the difference between the world and a Christian no see because you're still living just like the rest of the world Lily right you're still there I mean we go and we do to her we're here we work we make a living we've got to do all of the things of the world yes but we come out of the world as to where the world doesn't control us now we're all controlled by the world to a degree I mean if you don't think so don't go to work tomorrow you're not going to get paid right did he but see we're not trying to come out of that away is coming out of the things that that is controlling us to keep us tied to those things so it's the same with with the religious form that's why you don't hear me hollering the screaming messages about this Badness is wrong the message is wrong the catholic's wrong it's wrong no you and I what's wrong and I've tried my best to preach the truth to you over these 39 years to try to get you and I to see that we are the biggest organization in our individual cells that there is because that's what an organization is well brother Dale I've been in the message a long time we'll praise God how long has the message been in you right right amen are you being born again are you becoming just a hateful arrogant um you know I guess the most arrogant of all forms of religious movements would be like a Oneness form that's right are we just turning out to be a Oneness group of people that we've got it and you got to come to us you've never heard me say that I've never taught nothing like that I never thought that Lula is the only place if around the world the word of God is being revealed I got a thing to want to go but from those and being arrested there in what is it Iran which is really Iran isn't it and there was about they've got about 10 more that was arrested and I assume that they're Believers and and they're being arrested for what they believe well see we're sitting here under an independence freedom and at this point we're not being arrested but what about those right right but are we praying for those come on you know are we praying to to for God to deliver those people right right because they're putting their life on the line they might not know what you know about the message but if that is Believers the message is what's putting them in jail right right well thank God for our freedom to worry that we can exist right but see under that freedom is an opportunity also to relax right to become conformed to the world you see the scripture says for you to not be conformed to the world but be you transform what by the renewing right amen amen see by the opening of the word amen revealed word that's why I've tried to preach the word to you for 39 years that's been my goal is to preach the word to you to get you to a word that you can see God right that's what I've always said to you I don't tell you what God does with me a lot of times because I don't want you built on me I want the word revealed in you right when that brother saw at that time and he's seen it many times he's seen the the pillar of fire here in the church it'd be up here at the front but then one day it was moving back to the congregation another brother said well it was leaving us well I didn't agree with that it was doing exactly what I was wanting it to be done I wanted to come out where you're at right I want the presence of the Lord to be in that seat where you're sitting right I go down these pews every day when I'm in here I go down with my hands hitting the fuse and saying Lord you touch these people you talk to these people you reveal yourself to them that's right why because it's not just me that's what I read that I want to go right around and said there's people right not just run around them with the message that was right he called us out right he called us out of it but now here's one thing that he couldn't do he can call you out the prophet could call you out right right because he can bring the message you know like we were talking about last night you can see maybe that organizations is wrong or this is wrong and you'll come out but if you don't get born again you're going to just come right out and form an organization just like everybody else is gone you're gonna come out and be just as bad as you was where you come from or even worse why because you're going to become highly religious right and you'll think you're right and you'll think you you know the thing today is not to repent right people don't want to repent no more how much time have you seen people repent you know of course they don't repent but see brother Brown could call us out right it's like Moses could bring the children of Israel out of Egypt all right when he did he smoked a rock it made an organization showed that he was not the one that was going to take him in right right he showed that because what he created but see Joshua took over amen Joshua represents Holy Spirit right we believe God sent us a prophet amen and we've been called out of organized religion amen but what about the organizations in us only the Holy Spirit can show you and I what's wrong with us there is no preacher nobody nowhere can show us what's wrong with us right brother calling he could come to they don't want to talk to you he can sit down we could talk for two weeks if God don't show me when it's over with it'll be the same as it was amen it takes the Holy Spirit right because See Redemption brought around and said what Paradox 65 . he said Redemption is in two parts out of and into amen you can be called out of organized religion that's right but have you went into Christ you know I think it's time I believe the message and you know that and all the years that I preached I've tried to read it to you and give it to your quotes and everything else to show you what brought around and say it I think it's time for us to start believing what he said amen amen and come out of ourselves and into Christ right amen come out of our ideas our opinions our thoughts and get into Christ see we can talk about what brother Brandon was amen we believe it but out up into right if we don't go into Christ I got a bunch of them wrote down through here where the Prophet said he's coming out and going into Now's the Time of coming out and going in getting out of those organizations and getting into Christ and coming out and going in time for all True Believers that's where we're at you're coming out of denominationalism to enter into the bride to go with the groom we're going into it going to it and we're in this Ephesus because that's what emphasis mean we're in this coming out of and one in one of one into another calling out is great we've been called out the prophet done his job but that Prophet could not put you into Christ now come on you say well no I've heard the prophet I believe the prophet I didn't stay with what the prophet said amen but when you're going into Christ that's right amen amen are you going to say that he's Christ now come on you know what I'm saying are you going to say that he's God that's going to take you in is your defendant spin up on that because I've never taught nothing like that out of the 39 years those messages that went around the country and split churches and things oh brother random got it man I used to go preach for a man he's dead now I'm going home but I used to preach for him he called my house probably at least once to twice a week he'd eat in my home he'd sit there we'd talk we were great friends you know I taught good Brothers in the Lord and one day I preached a little message here that brother random didn't have the revelation what I said was this way you've got to have it right that's right what he had he had right right but we've got to have that right revealed to us right and we've got to have a revelation he sent me word he said you won't preach no more for me he said in other words he said because I believe brother random had the Revelation that's my Revelation what he said the same thing I did he said he had a revelation he said he had a revelation he brought around I'm not a revelation but he said he didn't now no revelation all right I mean his own language was messed up but you see I believe that this message must be revealed to me amen I've never believed that it was going to church or believing that brother Adam was a prophet oh that's wonderful right if you don't do that there's something wrong with you amen right if you don't believe brother random was a prophet now if you've heard the message you know when you know the truth right Mr I keep wondering who you are I keep seeing that face back there but she favors somebody used to be in church here have you been here before okay I was thinking of somebody else like a really worse daughter but now listen see it's a coming out off but there's got to be a going into that's right right amen said you get your coat in handy this move houses that's coming out but what about the going into all right and Christ is the word is the word the most important thing that there is to you amen come on or is it just going to church and being good all of that's wonderful it's wonderful to do that are we getting into Christ come on and that's what I've tried to do you say well how's this connected I thought you were speaking on the the coming of the lord we see I believe the Lord's been coming right since the day of Pentecost Amen in the heart of ever born-again believer right what are you looking for a second coming well the Lord's going well the Lord don't descend from heaven like you're thinking he don't come down to earth like that because he doesn't set foot on Earth until the millennium we go to meet him in the air and I showed it to you from the prophet's message that the second coming of Jesus Christ is the rapture the second coming of Jesus Christ is the rapture why can't we meet him in the air okay jury becomes visible among us but visible doesn't mean Corporal right visual visible means apparent to the eye I've still got some things to preach on you know about the coming of the Lord and I believe the Lord's been coming amen I believe that the word has been preached here in Lula Georgia has brought some people to the position that their standing were the disciples were standing I'm gonna be blunt this morning I didn't say everybody I said I believe there's some here right that are standing where the apostles were standing brother asked me that here a while back said you believe we got the faith of the fathers I wouldn't talk about myself and I told him I wouldn't when I said I believe it's here I believe it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world and now here comes that but I don't see it but I can't see it I don't believe it it looks good on them videos but it's true see people say I don't see it what do you mean it's because you don't see it okay brother walked down here one time talking to a man his name was Dozier dips enough you know but he that's when they first went to the moon George probably alive and she brought her milk because all of you heard me tell it anyway but you know when they first went to the moon well he said they didn't go to the Moon he said they went out you in the desert somewhere and they made pictures no way to convince him except one thing throw him in a spaceship and sent him to the Moon Yeah that would have been the only way he would have believed it he probably said I dreamed it but you see is the word being revealed to us right because that's the coming of the Lord amen the coming of the Lord is what the bride coming out of the church come on it's the coming of the Lord that's why it's been taking place I'll give you a key look around never spoke of the seventh seal as the word come he always used the word come in and write that down crying through preaching me but see the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word amen that's what happened on the Dead Penny College on the day of Pentecost in the upper room when the Holy Ghost fail it revealed the word quickened the word they had held five thousand outside or three of what it was heard the message and when they did it was revealed to them this is that as Peter said amen it's always been to revealing of his word Martin Luther when he received the Joshua live by faith that was a revealing of God's word that was the coming of the Lord to him right he said no he didn't come out of the Scottish that's what you're looking at you're still looking for them and if you don't hear it you don't believe it come right you can figure it out remember what I read in here you get it figured out you're wrong that's why people back there see there was there was lambasting us the man told me on the phone one day said you just don't ever didn't believe brother Adam I said well and what it was about was he said this Rapture that's going to come and and on Good Friday here in 1973. I said well he said you believe that he said that price is going to be in 73 on Good Friday that was about probably a month before the Indian Ocean Chevrolet man I hope so he said evidently you don't believe it I said well I just now got my my thing set on dates and things you know somebody he said well they do have it figured out now we just let people trap herself you know he said they do figure it out it can be 40 days later I said now you evidently don't believe it yourself because you got 40 days extra no that's what he was just saying but see I stood there in time in 74 improved by The Profit that we could pass the year 2026. I still got those takes to prove it that a priest did back there but how many people wants to hear about it oh they'll go around saying nobody didn't believe brother by him you know nobody didn't believe we'd be here this long but I didn't want us to be here but I preached what the prophet said and proved that we could be here right and you know what we're here okay all right well so evidently all of them predictions and dates and things must have been wrong because you know we're still here right but the word of God is still real amen amen God can speak to people and show them right and show the truth about it you see I believe that's the coming of the Lord is a revealing of the word to you Martin Luther will go into Rapture because of what was revealed to him back then you know what that would be to him the second coming do you know where Martin Luther is going to meet him in the air but he's going to be raised and be here Among Us per 30 40-day period of time amen and then we'll all go to meet the Lord in here right you said but brother Dale I've always believed the second coming was some kind of a something Caleb well the words you get it that run around never targeted right the Bible never taught it your Prophet said we'd meet him in there the Bible says we'll meet him in there now where did we get the idea from our organizations from our own minds and our thoughts and that's what I was trying to tell the people back then I said that's all we're going to try to do we're going to try to go beyond man's Camp because if Jesus Christ is without the Gate of the church then that's where I want to be you said well you've got a church here well that's right we've got a church here so we gotta have a place to meet me all right we've got a house no more to go that's what not the price not what the problem that's where he said it's not coming out of your church amen he never tried to get nobody to come out of the church he said you stay there and let your light shine now watch it here's where they'll quote the other part won't don't want to quote that part he said you let your light shine and they'll throw you out that's right man right that's right that's right he said they'll put you out why because they're going out to your shoulder and where the Count's at all right but you see I want to be where God is at and God is in the revealed word amen that's all I've ever tried to do I've never been against anybody I've defended all of these brothers over the years that would be preaching thing and telling you no that's not what they're saying they're trying to preach something to us they didn't know how but not knowing how to bring it they cause two Souls seventh on The Virtue bruise River Jordan they caused all kind of Doctrine but not knowing how to preach the word and handle the truth if we were covering last night to where the scripture said how can he preach unless he'd be sent right amen you know if you're not sin of God how can you preach the truth how you can mimic it quoted right but don't worry about it it's gonna go off you said well people today has got the pure adulterate word only if it's revealed right we have the pure renovated unadulterated Bible before the Prophet come on the scene to start preaching to us right he didn't get us a new one we just didn't know what it said right we had it misinterpreted amen he come to show us the correct understanding he couldn't reveal it as I said while ago the Lord Jesus brother Raymond says quote that the Lord Jesus said even my own life did not reveal that unto me but my Father which is in heaven the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word right that's why someone can call you out but they cannot take you in right Moses could call the people out take them out and through the Wilderness but he could not put him in the promised land right his greater profit as he was he formed an organization can't you see that the human mortal there's no way no human mortal that's right brother random or whoever can take us in right he said well you're against brother Randleman well that's where your mentality is messed up right I believe he called us out amen it was God using him because the Lord himself descended from heaven with a shout but that was not brother Branham the message that come through him which the Lord's descending not brother random descending right amen what was the message he was praying the word of God because only the Holy Ghost can reveal that unto us where would we be without this message right that's right amen right in every organization just like all the rest of them right but then have we come out of that to be able to disform others when you form an organization what you do is you draw a guideline and you pull it in and you say this is what we believe and we don't take no more you better end that with a comma and say anything else the Lord reveals right amen and he may reveal that to somebody that you don't even think is in the word it might be a surprise for me right to find out who really makes it but do you understanding what I'm saying see amen I have been trying my best to get us to come out now I can't take you into Christ I'm sorry but I think it's time to get into Christ I think it's time to get out of our ideas and repent of our lives and our ways and do it and let Christ come on the scene Amen Brother Gary and I are talking about something the Lord spoke to him the other day it's not your goodness it's going to bring him to you to speak to you but now if he'd have been down in The Honky Tonk yeah drunk is just oh hog now I don't think God's gonna do that speak to you you know what I ain't speaking you get out of the hot pen yeah but he's not going to speak this message to you to get you ready for a rapture no you got to get you out of the hog pin first right amen but then he can just come on the scene when he wants to that's right man he's sovereign you know right man but you know what I have to depend on somebody right you know brother random addict depend on somebody I have to depend on somebody I have to depend on the five-fold ministry listen I listen to people that when I get through I think well you know I didn't want to be derogatory and argue with him but I just didn't believe what monster went to brought and I don't listen to argue don't ever do that the Russian people only waiting for you to shut up long enough where they can refute what you're saying right that's what he said yeah but you see it's like I was talking to a man here a while back and he kept on he kept on and I just finally kept nailing one scripture not in one scripture after a while he said all right because he saw I was just going to stay on that one scripture right because that scripture told us exactly what's going on right but do you understand what I'm saying I believe that down through time has been the coming of the Lord and I believe we started here in 71 July the 4th and I believe that the word that I've been trying to bring to you is the word of the Lord I've had to correct some things and I taught myself and I come to you and correct them the Lord corrects me I'll come to you and tell you it's uncorrected I mean that's that's just the way it is I used to believe that that was about your uh theophany and uh but I found out one day the prophet said the office don't eat huh well I appreciate that away yeah but I found out when we get over in heaven they might change a lot of things you know because we're all going to be together Body Spirit and soul we need 10. sure when I see something that corrects now I'll come tell you that's right I'll make a correction on the tape you know I'm gonna say that's it now I used to believe this but don't believe it no more right but I believe the coming of the Lord is revealing Thy Word or if I didn't believe that there would be no need of me coming to church if you don't need of us together and if I didn't believe that we were coming to hear from God that's right and when anybody comes here to preach that's the way I pray amen I pray Lord use that brother to speak to the people and most of all use them to speak to me that's right amen well you know a whole lot more than he does I didn't pray that away that's right I'm not deferred the guy that was standing there saying Lord I fast all this I do all these things I'm not like that fella over there no right I'm that Feller over there that said God forgive me amen and I'm crying out for him to feed me when I go anywhere right I'm praying for God to feed me amen why go if you're not and I believe it I believe this has been a coming out we spent 39 years coming out I think it's about time to get into it's about time to get into Christ because that's what he's coming back for you you're and me are not so goody goody that he's coming back after us that's right you know larger no he's coming back after himself because it's not you anyway it's him in you right he's coming back after himself in you because that's what he made the promise that's where he gave you the Holy Ghost so he's coming back after the Holy Ghost to take it in the Rapture you and I get to Ride Along because it's not that we're going to be so goody goody no I think one thing we are going to be we're going to be forgiven amen amen we're going to be sincere enough to be asked for forgiveness come out and go in come out and go in and brother Gary he told me he told me one time he said brother Dave I see it he said this is all of it I said no brother if you hurry I'm sorry you know I didn't want to bust his bubble yeah I mean he was sincere I said what you've got is the foundation and it took him a while to kind of swallow that I you know you say well how did you know it was just this Foundation because what I've got today tomorrow comes what I've got today is a foundation and tomorrow God can give me as we'll do in the communion he can give me my daily bread thank you now one reason and I said it's because me and him wouldn't go on the rapture now if he'd called me up and he said brother Dale this is it there's not no more and me and him both lifted off the Earth I'd agree with him 100. right right didn't happen so I said Brother Gary what you've seen is a foundation wonderful thing but it's a foundation now ask him about it now to see what's happened since then that the Lord has revealed to him but each time the Lord reveals something to you remember it's a foundation all right it's a foundation for something else right man because if not we're going to walk off one of these days there'll be somebody to get the revelation because the prophet said the Rapture is a revelation the bride be waiting on the revelations rapture and it's going to come and we're going to get it we're going to walk off the earth then it won't be going up in the air and I think this is it it'll be the fact of what you know right you see I believe that what I've tried to do is to preach you and I to a position because it's been my goal a position to be waiting for God to pick us up because I always say to you don't go down to the bus depot waiting on the train right go to the train station get the statue find out what's the time it's going to leave and then don't go buy your hamburger across the street if you're supposed to leave in five minutes okay the most contrary to popular opinion God he can do without us that's right that's wrong way of saying it but he knew how to us and I can't do without him my dependence has always been on them if we're around here another 10 years if we made it another 40. you would hear me saying the same thing not just because I preached 26 you know 2026 we could go there I never had any intention of thinking we'd ever get to our note I was just proving we could but see the way I see it now we could be here to five thousand and not break God's word of course me and you ain't gonna be here right right you see because when I see it now what I was doing then was saying 7 7 is 49. and I was adding 49 on to 1977. they had to come out to be somewhere around 2026. all right let's see where I see it now eternity amen because in 1977 was a 70th Jubilee your prostate City since the beginning of Jubilation making exactly 3 430 years he said it'd be the going up of the Gentile Brighton and the return of Christ to the Jews when they go out of bondage what the Jubilee not the year amen the Jubilee your profit coming to 49. declaring Liberty for the 50. I think it's time for us to start saying Prophet said to be true you say well I believe it and I say it but do we really is it reveal this we're going to take we're doing kind of different today because we're not having one service sorry so we're going to have communion but now we're not going to have foot worship we're going to have communion okay it's a different situation because we're not going to be here this afternoon go downstairs and have a meal and eat together and enjoy and fellowship around a natural meal and it won't be an evening service we'll be here you know for whatever time you want to be and fellowshipping and talking about the word of the Lord and what I would wish you would do would do what I said think about what's been revealed to you okay sometimes you just sit down and think oh here I think I shouldn't say it but I will anyway what a lot of people do they come to a place they like Lula and I've watched it for many years and they come here and they don't know a whole lot about the message they know the quote but not the real deal well then after a while they begin to catch on to what's going on and they begin to see the review work the first thing you know they become one's there realizing they got it yeah instead of realizing where we get it from right I get mine from the profits connection and I get it from the five-fold ministry right and they break it down to you see that doesn't take me anywhere it may be anything different you see then what people will do they seem to forget that when they came here I seem to forget when they came here they didn't know what's going on yep like I saw the last night in the Bible study you know question was asked you know how do you introduce the message or whatever I should first off remember where you come from amen right and I said I've been around here long enough to know that a lot of people here that it took me six months to pound them hard to get them to see maybe one little point and I said when they're killing everybody else down the road later I don't see why you can't see this because I've seen it immediately well I'm sorry I'm sorry that I'm just blunt I shouldn't be that hurt stealing what true her feelings do I have anything to do with this situation yeah damn it I know what it took for for the most Compound on me and I never come in the message saying I believe this all alone yeah I came into Mexicans like everybody else right right the revealed word then just want to take care of all those right we give credit where credit is due because I believe in the final Ministry amen for sure for the Perfection of the science and I've always said this if we knew where there was a real true prophet in the final four Ministry now you understand the process and fossil Ministry are you talking about going out getting another church information during nothing like that I'm talking about a profit in the faithful Ministry if you'll show me where one day I'll give you to come in right but you better remember you'll have freely free freedom to stand here and call out our name call our team right brother came here one time and he said you better watch that person I said no okay he said but I'm telling you you better watch it I said brother I know all about it it was just a comfort for God to speak to him to tell me something I already knew but Lucifer I believe this is a coming out Now's the Time To Go in yes a Rapture is waiting you and I a change of these bodies and it'd only be done by the reveal word amen what was it the other day that uh let's put in motion into you if they signed over at the U.N they were now the U.N is controlling whatever the U.N says Hillary Clinton she said you put it in whatever the U.N says is what we got in the Bible if they say no guns we lose our guns yeah it shined over to the U.N ET that's right you tell me that's not a One World Government that's right we should have signed to bring in with the United Nations to bring one world government that's right but now they've shined it over to whatever they say we've got to abide by yep pay close attention no signs are taking place let's just be ready let's stand together and protect the community then we'll go downstairs we have some of the finest musicians that believeth in the world and his message we have some of the finest singers we have some of the finest couples amen and we're all a pretty good son of it it's a choice we've been around her a long time and we can't put an ounce on that yeah I've thought about time rocks around her neck just get it away but okay I love to eat remember I love to eat natural I love to eat damn it I don't mean that because Joyce is a pretty good eater I at least don't understand where to go amen but you see we have some of the best people in the world that's right thank God for you believe that thank God for all them meals you've made and all the time yep it's been wonderful 39 years that we've been here I took over in 1975 as pastor from that time until now I've tried to preach the truth to you amen I was trying back to her to do it remote and I preached together for 71 until 75. when you got sick he stepped down but you see I've tried to just move on and that's all I want us to do you might not agree with my actions and my ways that's fine I don't agree with everything that's honest it's not bad it's going to put us in Rapture that's right this should reveal a word none donkey told a prophet one time what to do right that's right so we've been released let's just go right into the communion and second Corinth First Corinthians 11. 23. Brown received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus is saying not in which he was betrayed good bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take Heat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembers for me after the same manner also he took the cut when he had some saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this New Year's office you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the Lord said till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord we let a man examine himself and so they didn't either that bread and drink of that cup see that's what we're going to do examine ourselves not me Examining you it's mid-ground in my own self right but he doesn't drink up unworldly he doesn't drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many a week and sickly among you in many sleep judge ourselves we should not be judged now this is the scripture I like but when we are judged right even for wrong and we're judged and God will judges but when we are judged we are chasing to the Lord one that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat tired one for another and if they man hunger let him eat a home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will sit in order when I come let's just have a few moments of solid prayer praying for one another if you want the prophet said pray for your passion yes and for one another we love you and thank you you made it all man be your hands and believe in you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed father we thank you for this bread it was made for this purpose today and now as we come to this point we know that this is not the literal body but it is a representation it means really your word Lord as we eat this bread we think about you and what you've done all the way through the word to bring us to a place that we can stand here you know if you're on adulterated Mason you're the hour and waiting upon a change of these vile bodies that we live in we love you we thank you sanctify the bread and the protectors in Jesus name I always think the children of Israel and we're leaving out of Egypt last thing they've done to continue Prophet said we get over there marriage supper he'll be the comedian you know be a wonderful kind of one you know we won't have to be worried about downstairs and eat and what we're going to eat and what we're going to do it'll all be pretty well over with by then we can just sit back and have a good time and you know not being on prayer and just let the Lord take care of everything and you know I'll be done Prophet said you look across the table and you'll see the people that made it he said then he can reach over and wipe the tears from her eyes you know we could see him wonderful time all the types and shatters of now being fulfilled here in our presence in the end of time father we thank you for additional Hindi that went through the process and gets better each day as we eat a little piece of bread we drink this little part of wine Lord than ever be in our bodies to make blood cells for us tomorrow and we would literally be living off this but we know these things are only to an example because this is not your blood this is wine but it represents your blood to stimulate the makers one with you we love you and we ask you sanctify the wine and the protectors in Jesus name foreign for me and rejected and my question oh Father then I tell you at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you believe it um morning the prophet said some morning between six and nine Something's Gonna take place through the midnight the children of Israel I really enjoyed that when we were in this project and I wrote it in my Bible sometimes you can look at it it was about three or four of the songs that they always sang as they were entering the temple you know well you know that would be a wonderful thing to think about those songs because the songs there the whole Bible can be sung if it's put into the form of thinking because it is the songs you know in those people as they were entering the temple they would be singing them song well can't you see them that it would be not a mass confusion but here's one group that's up ahead nursing another group that's back in another and they're saying another one in another and it's coming down you know to all but you know when we all get there and be the same song We'll All finish up singing those hymns would be a wonderful time thank you you're stuck on these things remember now that things that I've announced and what we'll be doing I'll be trying to preach when you see that yeah we brought the tied up back that afternoon get ready because she's gonna be going through sometimes getting ready for the operation every Thursday one but just remember therapy population you know just pray for it just stop and say well Lord amen be with her they cure over and like I told a doctor

sister go get it ready okay okay everybody sit down brother they did find us some songs and the sisters can go downstairs and get to the uh the dinner ready for us and you come in let's just sing and and worship have a good time in him because I I hope that I've tried to make my point about the Fourth of July it has a great cleaning tuition or natural thank God for our freedom and in America that
