[6:17] we had got word that the Ambassador uh

[6:26] say Zion like they call it Zeon Zeon
[6:30] he was he was the uh ambassador from
[6:33] Israel to Ireland and he was leaving to
[6:37] go back to
[6:38] Jerusalem and he wanted to see us before
[6:41] before he left so I had to go from the
[6:44] airport uh my wife picked us up and uh
[6:48] uh we drove right to the Embassy so I
[6:50] had to get my under my suit and stuff
[6:52] like that you know but we had a
[6:53] wonderful time there and I just said to
[6:56] the Ambassador before he left I said
[6:58] there's one thing I want to tell you Mr
[7:00] Ambassador and it's this that I do not
[7:04] believe in a trinity I do not believe
[7:07] there are three gods and one godhead I
[7:10] said I believe in the god the god of
[7:12] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that's right
[7:15] and he came up went back this a little
[7:17] bit of that and CU cuz he's a great
[7:20] friend of uh that fell in Texas my
[7:23] whatever you call him and he's poured in
[7:24] millions of dollars to to uh to Israel
[7:28] and he says
[7:30] well he says we never talk about that
[7:33] when going to let that one drop when
[7:35] he's talking to him but I just said I
[7:37] want I want you to to know that and uh
[7:40] the Ambassador I told him when he came
[7:43] up to Donny B I said never trust the
[7:46] Catholic Church never trust the Catholic
[7:49] church and I still say that today and uh
[7:52] so uh we give him some lovely little uh
[7:55] uh kind of uh pictures of of Don Ireland
[8:00] and he said to me he said um I I'll put
[8:03] these up in in our uh home in Jerusalem
[8:06] so that's where they're hanging today
[8:08] and he gave us a lovely plate of like
[8:11] kind of all these little squares with
[8:13] Jerusalem and and shapes and it I forget
[8:16] mosic that's what it is mosic beautiful
[8:19] we've got it up in our home as well so

[8:28] what the isra ambassador to the
[8:33] Vatican I'm telling you that's I am
[8:35] telling you this is true you couldn't
[8:37] make it up if
[8:38] you you just couldn't make it up you
[8:41] know so uh really and truly you know
[8:43] we're so thankful and he C so calls as
[8:46] our friend as a matter of fact if I may
[8:48] just take a moment to tell you that um
[8:50] when I was talking to him I said um you
[8:53] know uh I had a dream of you and he said
[8:57] oh and I said yes sir I I said and in
[9:00] the dream a little bit like Stonewall
[9:02] Jackson in the dream I said we were kind
[9:05] of traveling we were moving and and we
[9:08] came to this place and I said uh
[9:10] Ambassador I said we can sit down here
[9:14] and rest look at that view it's
[9:16] beautiful so I told him that dream and I
[9:19] said sir I said one day I believe that
[9:22] we'll sit down in the kingdom of God
[9:24] together amen and we'll be a place where
[9:27] that's perfect right amen so you pray
[9:29] for him CU he's going to be a needy man
[9:31] and a lovely man and and we thank we
[9:34] thank the Lord to have his friendship he
[9:36] still ask S betters a lot uh so I I
[9:39] appreciate that uh last last year we
[9:43] left um I've left some photographs at
[9:46] the back there just there's a little
[9:47] table on the right before the pastor's
[9:49] office and uh you if if you wish to if
[9:53] you don't wish to it's quite okay but if
[9:55] you wish to you can look through some of
[9:56] the photographs of what I took obviously
[9:58] I took lot more but just just to give
[10:01] you a little uh idea of what happened
[10:03] last November and uh uh so we we went
[10:07] off to uh to India last November and I
[10:10] was pleased we baptized four four people
[10:13] and uh you you'll see that there's one
[10:15] of them and a little river and they
[10:17] actually it was so so dry there that
[10:20] they had to scoop out a
[10:21] hole in in the river bed so as we could
[10:24] get the little girl in but we got her in
[10:27] we baptized her a long walk and need a
[10:30] turban for me or a matal but it worked
[10:33] well too and uh we baptized the three
[10:35] people we came to the village and this
[10:38] need was read out it wasn't read out
[10:40] from me it was read out from Brother no
[10:42] because brother brother Danny uh living
[10:44] in the tager reserve he we baptized him
[10:47] about 5 years ago and now he's a pastor
[10:50] doing this work in that Village and now
[10:53] they've got $4,000 out of the out of the
[10:55] missionary convention to and that will
[10:57] be just a such a rich blessing to him
[11:00] amen and it was his mother his father I
[11:02] led to the Lord I baptized him and uh
[11:05] last year because she was sick the year
[11:07] before last year when we arrived
[11:09] November she wanted to be baptized and
[11:11] it was getting dark so remember this is
[11:14] a tiger Reserve there's no more roads
[11:16] very it's unbelievable just jungle ahead
[11:19] so there was this little path up to the
[11:21] well and the government they dig the
[11:24] wells for the people about 40t maybe in
[11:27] circumference maybe 25 ft deep 30 ft I
[11:31] don't know what depth they are uh to get
[11:33] down to the water level and so uh it was
[11:36] dark but they still wanted to be
[11:37] baptized so they led us down to this
[11:39] place and I they had torches and they
[11:42] shown it you'll see it it's pure dark
[11:44] it's black you you look at the
[11:46] photographs and uh so I I the first
[11:49] thing I said to myself there's nobody
[11:50] going to be baptized here
[11:52] tonight I look in this big hole you know
[11:55] they're not even steps how they going to
[11:57] get you done you know but within second
[12:00] some of the boys had scrambled down and
[12:01] the next thing they're holding up hands
[12:02] to me and so we got down and into the
[12:04] water and uh that they couldn't do for
[12:07] me I had to get into the water myself
[12:09] and find my fooding and I'm up about
[12:10] here in water and the more you go back
[12:12] the deeper it gets and so we baptized
[12:15] the first brother fine and then the
[12:17] little sister who had come to the Lord
[12:20] uh and had been si uh she was baptized
[12:23] but she she stiffened up when I just got
[12:26] her under the water and she stiffened up
[12:27] like a board and I I don't it was the
[12:30] best that I could do remember this is
[12:32] pitched
[12:33] dark the best I could do was get her up
[12:35] again so I managed to do that but it
[12:37] took such an effort that I went
[12:40] backwards right and spash right into the
[12:43] water and you know so I didn't mind and
[12:46] I scrambled out and one of the brothers
[12:48] grabbed a hold of me and weeded me out
[12:50] and then we baptized the last person
[12:52] they were fine so you have these you
[12:54] have these things you know and I
[12:56] remember one time similarly uh that we
[13:00] baptized some folks in a a big tank like
[13:02] that a big you know it's a great big
[13:04] Wells and uh there was a big commotion
[13:07] going on and I said what's what's
[13:09] happening up there and they said oh it's
[13:10] all right they just pulled a snake out
[13:12] of the water and
[13:15] away you can imagine how I felt you
[13:18] going into the water you know you know
[13:20] it doesn't have any brothers and sisters
[13:22] down there but you know yeah God's good
[13:25] and so it was wonderful amen amen and uh
[13:28] praise the Lord
[13:29] um uh there there is uh you'll see a
[13:32] photograph down there of a pastor you
[13:34] might know him he's standing there with
[13:36] his son but uh just goes to show you
[13:38] that missionary work is that uh when we
[13:41] arrived they were just down to the last
[13:43] of their race just down to the last of
[13:45] it amen and just dust that's all they
[13:48] had that's all they were eaing and and
[13:50] he didn't even he was so proud of a man
[13:52] very very proud people you know he
[13:54] wouldn't even mention it but we had
[13:56] brought him over two big sex of race
[13:58] about that s there amen and so to me
[14:00] that's what missionary work everybody's
[14:02] got their own thing to do amen some
[14:04] people we we built churches but I ain't
[14:06] going to build anymore but I tell you
[14:08] what uh everybody's got their own and I
[14:10] like to bring food to the people to the
[14:13] poor people they're all still in The
[14:14] Villages mostly not they're still uh
[14:17] quite poor so anyway uh I we so happy
[14:19] with that amen and we left him happy as
[14:22] you can well imagine uh at that time and
[14:24] his wife was in tears showing that to
[14:26] brother Freddy amen and uh
[14:29] let me see uh yes if if I may uh we we
[14:34] spoke to about 2,000 people last
[14:36] November in India so that was quite a
[14:38] lot of people to preach to 2,000 people
[14:41] and last year I remember telling you
[14:43] this is this is the sister here and this
[14:46] is the sister that was in the coma last
[14:47] year I told you that she had been raised
[14:49] out of that coma and uh I tell you one
[14:52] thing the day I looked at her and she
[14:54] was in that coma she didn't look like
[14:55] that right but this last November when I
[14:58] got there uh I didn't think I was going
[15:00] to meet her but her son brought her out
[15:02] and there she was amen and I thank God I
[15:05] really thank
[15:06] for is so
[15:09] good amen and I'll tell you what friends
[15:12] I I critics are critics so those be
[15:15] critics I couldn't care less am I saw
[15:18] that Hallelujah I saw that with my own
[15:20] eyes and I didn't do it Gary I did not
[15:22] do it it was God that did it amen and so
[15:25] we're thankful there's the little woman
[15:26] there and I want to show you this
[15:28] because couldn't have a child amen and
[15:31] uh and they asked us to pray and I knew
[15:33] why uh the medical conditions and all
[15:36] why they couldn't have a child but they
[15:37] ask us to pray and that's all you can do
[15:39] is pray amen now God has every right to
[15:42] say yes or no amen he can say whatever
[15:44] he he he's God and so the thing is that
[15:47] uh we prayed but the next day the Lord
[15:50] spoke to us as I read the book of Psalms
[15:52] and he said I have heard your prayer and
[15:54] when that came out when I was praying
[15:56] about that subject and that came out I
[15:57] knew that God had heard the prayer and
[16:00] so there she is in the family way and
[16:03] praise the Lord at they uh they
[16:06] contacted us brother Aaron they
[16:08] contacted us and they uh asked us to
[16:10] name the baby so I said well I believe
[16:13] it will be a boy but if it's a girl cuz
[16:15] I'm not going to be dogmatic I just
[16:16] believe it's going to be a boy and she
[16:18] was carrying quite high and all that and
[16:20] I I said you call it Steven so this
[16:23] January past uh baby Steven come into
[16:25] the world Amen
[16:31] seen that happen more more than once
[16:33] praise the Lord I've seen that happen
[16:34] more than once folks and amen let me
[16:36] just go on down fast amen uh let me see
[16:41] we just leave leave that off there amen
[16:44] and en tiand this year praise the lord
[16:46] it's it was beautiful because we have a
[16:48] Sunday morning service here and wouldn't
[16:50] it be lovely if someone has you brought
[16:52] someone this morning or a family member
[16:54] and you're really sitting there and you
[16:55] don't know the Lord and you can know the
[16:58] Lord amen
[16:59] and the the pastor son his wife didn't
[17:02] know the Lord and she come out and Reed
[17:05] Christ on the first Sunday of was enand
[17:07] this year so that's that's that's our
[17:09] business amen right that's the business
[17:11] of the church amen to reach out to
[17:13] everyone who will be reached out to you
[17:15] amen so that was a thrill and on the
[17:17] Wednesday night we had special services
[17:19] we we have these special services now
[17:21] every year and at the end we give them
[17:24] their little bags of rice and their oil
[17:27] and their noodles and whatnot and they
[17:29] like that they're poor people so I don't
[17:31] mind and that was wonderful and then
[17:34] there was three three uh four four young
[17:37] three young girls and one boy came to
[17:39] the Lord as well on the Wednesday night
[17:40] in Thailand amen so I'm glad people say
[17:43] have you ever been up to um uh uh uh
[17:46] Manar Burma I have and I baptized people
[17:49] up up in Burma as well I baptized people
[17:51] everywhere and you know and and so I
[17:54] just thank God for it folks it's
[17:55] wonderful and uh that was a wonderful
[17:58] time we baptized seven people in in
[18:00] Thailand so the church is doing well
[18:02] wish somebody would come along and start
[18:05] over to Ireland and start winning souls
[18:07] for
[18:09] us amen but that's the way God works you
[18:12] know and and he does the unusual uh
[18:15] thing in the unusual place and in an
[18:17] unusual way always on the unexpected way
[18:20] praise God and certainly that is the
[18:23] truth amen now um let me see here if I
[18:27] can just go on very very very fast here
[18:29] we went on down to Vietnam amen and
[18:33] uh we had the ministers meeting praise
[18:36] the Lord and I just want to mention this
[18:38] of a May if you just give me that few
[18:39] moments to do it folks uh there was one
[18:42] one little brother and he traveled a
[18:44] thousand kilm to be at the meetings a
[18:47] thousand now I don't mean in a nice air
[18:49] conditioned bus I mean probably some old
[18:51] thing I brought them down from the hills
[18:54] down to a city maybe the buses would get
[18:55] a little bit better and he put a big
[18:57] effort into coming he was so worried
[19:00] that he he wouldn't be able to get May
[19:01] back home again cuz you know he spent
[19:03] all his means and uh I really thought
[19:07] that was wonderful and then when he's
[19:10] not even Vietnamese because the
[19:11] Vietnamese many many hundreds of years
[19:13] ago maybe thousands pushed them all up
[19:15] into the hills so these are ethnic
[19:18] people that lived in that country even
[19:20] before the Vietnamese lived in it yeah
[19:22] and uh there he is and he's going around
[19:25] they got the we we couldn't I couldn't
[19:27] go up there and ey there been no way I
[19:29] could go up to that place because I
[19:30] would have to pass through the town and
[19:32] then go up that far the police would
[19:34] just arrest you in minutes you know just
[19:37] couldn't do it but he can do it amen and
[19:39] that's who you support the that can do
[19:41] it and so uh he was telling us that he
[19:45] was had been in prison from
[19:47] 1997 imagine so close five in prison for
[19:50] Jesus Christ and you know that our
[19:51] brothers and sisters are in prison over
[19:53] in Iran today right now as we for the
[19:57] gospel imagine right just because you
[19:59] believe in Jesus Christ in prison and
[20:02] that's a sh that's a sh for that to
[20:04] happen but it does happen Paul went into
[20:06] prison on mine but when he was in prison
[20:10] first of all he showed me on his
[20:11] photograph he showed me the the ball of
[20:14] fire right there up in the church
[20:15] imagine I never heard nothing about
[20:17] nothing yet the ball of fires right
[20:19] there in the middle of their Church P
[20:21] you know so so God is God and he knows
[20:24] his own elect I'll tell you that and um
[20:27] then he said that while he was in prison
[20:29] it must have been awful hard but uh
[20:32] sometimes I do believe that God will
[20:33] take you out of yourself just out of
[20:35] yourself the peeling your body might be
[20:37] such but he just take you out of
[20:39] yourself and he said he showed me the
[20:42] city he showed me the city man he had a
[20:45] a wonderful thing if God showed him the
[20:46] city that we're going to amen and and
[20:49] how much the Lord would think about that
[20:51] little man amen to give him such a a
[20:54] revelation and such a tour amen so it
[20:57] was it was truly truly wonderful and we
[20:59] had a wonderful time there I've got a
[21:01] little photograph if you look at the
[21:03] back of it there I've tried to read it
[21:05] in that in Vietnam there's a little
[21:08] meeting and that's just before the
[21:09] police came this year and uh we've had
[21:12] our little ups and downs with the police
[21:14] over there but you know God's always
[21:16] took us through amen and uh the police

[22:42] pastor about the violations and all the
[22:44] rest of it and uh I think actually hard

[23:14] with his motorbike and he handed me a
[23:16] helmet and he said put that on so I put
[23:17] it on he said get on so my little case

[28:11] amen praise the
[28:12] Lord amen and I'm make be sure that when
[28:15] the people it's a Sunday morning amen we
[28:18] just want to be fed by the word of God
[28:21] is that right amen so if you would
[28:24] please turn to your Bible amen and I
[28:28] just put this out the way if I
[28:33] may praise the Lord amen and it's going
[28:36] to be in Corinthians we're going to read
[28:38] in Corinthians but we're going to go
[28:39] back into the Old Testament but we're
[28:41] going to read in the book of Corinthians
[28:43] chapter one uh very very well-known
[28:47] scripture but uh I believe that if you
[28:50] just sit there God will speak to you on
[28:53] this lovely subject so it's a
[28:56] Corinthians chapter 1 and and um First
[28:59] Corinthians that is not just to keep you
[29:01] right there and it's verse 17 we we can
[29:03] read from you know that Prophet said we
[29:05] should read the word of God at every
[29:06] service that's right every service for
[29:08] Christ sent me not to baptize now that's
[29:11] Paul's speaking certainly not me amen
[29:14] but to preach the gospel not with the
[29:16] wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ
[29:19] be made of none of fact am for the
[29:22] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[29:23] perish foolishness but unto us which are
[29:26] saved it is the power of God for it is
[29:30] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[29:31] wise and will bring to nothing the
[29:33] understanding of the predent where is
[29:35] the wise where is the Scribe where is
[29:38] the disputer of the world hath not God
[29:40] made foolishness the wisdom of this
[29:44] world and if you want me to just say
[29:46] something here going to Mars is
[29:51] foolishness musl of the world Amen
[29:54] you're right there with me amen amen for
[29:57] after that the wisdom of God the World
[30:00] by wisdom you not God it please God by
[30:03] the foolishness of preaching to see them
[30:05] that believe in for the Jews require a
[30:08] sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom
[30:11] another new thing you know you know
[30:13] you've read it in the ACT but we preach
[30:15] Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[30:18] stumbling block and unto the Greeks
[30:20] foolishness but unto them which are
[30:22] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[30:25] power of God and the wisdom of God so
[30:28] Christ is the wisdom of God because the
[30:31] foolishness of God is wiser than men and
[30:34] the weakness of God is stronger than man
[30:36] right and if ye see your calling
[30:39] Brethren hi that not many wise men after
[30:42] the flesh not many made uh might not
[30:46] many noble are called that's right but
[30:48] God has chosen the foolish things of the
[30:50] world to confound the wise and God has
[30:53] chosen the weak things of the world to
[30:56] confound the things which are might y
[30:58] amen and the be things of the world and
[31:00] things which are despised have God
[31:02] chosen Y and things which are not to
[31:05] bring to not things that are that no
[31:08] flesh should glory in his presence but
[31:11] of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God
[31:15] is made unto us wisdom right but of him
[31:20] are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is
[31:23] made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[31:27] and
[31:29] sanctification and Redemption that as it
[31:31] is written he that glorieth let him
[31:34] glory in the Lord amen praise the Lord
[31:37] maybe we'll just at a moment uh we'll
[31:39] have a short prayer gracious Heavenly
[31:42] Father we just thank you Lord for this
[31:45] Lord's day and you said Lord Jesus that
[31:47] we should honor the resurrection amen
[31:50] and the prophet told us that Lord by
[31:52] coming to church and so Lord here we are
[31:55] your s this morning to honor the
[31:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ and Lord we
[32:00] do pray now that you will come in our

[32:26] that's okay I'll about 160 minutes
[32:28] but the wisdom of God Amen and uh praise
[32:31] the Lord the wisdom of God um Jim said
[32:35] If any man lack wisdom let him ask God
[32:39] let him ask God that giveth to all men
[32:42] liberally so God is a liberal he didn't
[32:44] know that but he is he's a liberal Giver
[32:48] Hallelujah and praise the
[32:51] Lord I'm not say anything Lord Brother I
[32:55] know amen amen but that he giveth to all
[32:59] men liberally and breath not amen he
[33:02] doesn't have any distinctions praise God
[33:04] he doesn't care what what you are as
[33:07] long as you believe and it shall be
[33:09] given to him that wisdom shall be given
[33:11] to him but let him ask in faith amen let
[33:14] him ask in faith amen now uh some of you
[33:17] I'm sure you have your computer you have
[33:19] the message the table on it and you can
[33:22] see what y says about wisdom and all
[33:24] that wisdom Broad and full intelligence
[33:26] and of diverse manners and stuff like
[33:29] that and the wisdom of God and the
[33:31] Supreme intelligence of God that's
[33:33] that's all true every bit of it but if I
[33:36] could just bring it down we're we're a
[33:38] lot of us are country people and if I
[33:40] could just bring it down to this wisdom
[33:42] is the ability to use experience to use
[33:46] experience amen a understanding and
[33:50] knowledge in order to make sensible
[33:53] decisions amen sensible decisions and
[33:56] judgments and some people folks are not
[33:59] making sensible decisions even in the
[34:01] message standing up and saying things
[34:03] that they ought not to say see so amen
[34:06] and that's what wisdom is the ability to
[34:07] use that experience and understanding
[34:09] and knowledge in order to make sensible
[34:12] decisions and judgments amen and and and
[34:15] that's true now this this is where I
[34:18] suppose I wouldn't say it's Irish but
[34:20] we're going to go back to the Book of
[34:21] Proverbs amen so you you stand there in

[34:53] surprising how many people don't seem to
[34:57] be able to ask the Lord what they should
[34:59] do amen they may ask this counselor or
[35:03] that person but but not the Lord and
[35:06] that's the very first person we should

[35:21] of wisdom and more correctly I would say
[35:24] the book of divine wisdom amen this is
[35:26] God's wisdom in here Hallelujah and we
[35:29] we'll look at it amen and he even says
[35:31] it to know wisdom uh verse uh one verse

[35:46] be beat with a whip it's a reverential
[35:48] fear that you know he's a holy God Amen
[35:51] and so uh praise the Lord that is the
[35:54] beginning of knowledge that is the
[35:56] beginning of wisdom to have that fear of
[35:59] the Lord in uh in your heart amen and
[36:03] wisdom and knowledge of sisters they're

[36:19] everywhere but yet man rejected yet men
[36:22] rejected they reject the wisdom of God

[36:28] Chapter 2 incline your ear both your
[36:31] iner ear and your inner ear unto wisdom

[44:33] he kept picking on him you know every
[44:36] chance he got it said well look at the

[44:50] he said I don't know what kind of God
[44:51] you're worshiping he says well you know

[46:07] amen and uh praise God it's so
[46:10] beautifully balanced I don't want to go

[49:35] exposed to her lack of faith and she's
[49:38] standing there and he said is there
[49:39] anything too hard for the Lord here and
[49:42] she was so taken by it that she got the
[49:44] Revelation she seen herself in the
[49:46] promised land it wasn't Abraham only it
[49:49] was her and she believed him Hallelujah

[51:30] flesh avoid the lust of the eyes and
[51:33] avoid the pride of life amen that's what
[51:37] he's saying here and that's what we

[56:34] real TR trick question that's the
[56:36] greatest Minds come up with that and
[56:39] they thought they had him what can he
[56:41] say because of he said yes then the
[56:43] Pharisees will go down and say you're a
[56:45] traitor you're not an Israelite you see
[56:47] yeah so what's he going to say if you
[56:49] say no then they're going to say you're
[56:51] not Caesar's friend and they got him
[56:53] they have got him Hallelujah that's what
[56:56] they thought but they didn't realize the
