[1:18] other sicknesses and problems in Jesus
[1:20] very far away Go Fish Company on this
[1:27] okay what we need yeah he don't take a
[1:30] look just for that if I say something
[1:32] wrong right behind a buddy stop me so
[1:41] I'm going to talk about today is a
[1:44] variety of things but there's something
[1:46] on my heart for a long time and this is
[1:49] the culmination of a thought that I've
[1:51] had going for a long time and basically
[1:56] before I get past this slide you know
[1:59] this is a mustard tree called a mustard
[2:02] tree it comes from a mustard seed he was
[2:05] said if you have faith as a grain of
[2:06] mustard seed right you know and mustard
[2:10] see it yields a tree that's rests all
[2:13] these great all these birds of the air
[2:14] can rest in the lambs of this monster
[2:16] tree yes now thank your brother dale has
[2:19] been not to exalt her posture i'm just
[2:22] saying he wants them had a must agree
[2:25] mustard seed faith and for one thing he
[2:28] wouldn't mix it with anything because
[2:30] that's what mustard seeds do they don't
[2:31] mix with anything for another thing it's
[2:34] a small seed too strongly and it grows
[2:36] into this great big tree and all of us
[2:38] little eaglets addressed in the lens of
[2:41] that tree anything off of the freedom
[2:42] and all of our lives can be a mustard
[2:45] tree if we plant that seed of faith and
[2:48] believe it and won't mix it with
[2:49] anything after many years you know we
[2:52] can grow to this great big tree that's
[2:53] should their hope in our design I said I
[2:55] thought about not that much today with
[2:57] this lesson it kind of has something to
[2:59] do with it but what I want to talk about
[3:00] is God's pattern
[3:02] so Dodd has a pattern the general
[3:05] pattern that he follows of bringing
[3:07] things up from a scene from a very small
[3:10] form and he's very secret very
[3:12] mysterious about it and he brings it up
[3:14] slowly he's you know very slow
[3:17] meticulous and very secret where the
[3:19] role camps it was going on there's only
[3:24] a few instances I can think of where he
[3:26] deviates from that where he didn't bring
[3:29] from a seed of that's like in the case
[3:31] of Melchizedek he made a full mature man
[3:33] you know body sprinkled those elements
[3:36] over that body and stepped into it and
[3:39] then one for angels and came down as a
[3:41] grown man grown men okay that was for
[3:44] purpose for that time for a pint okay
[3:47] and then save them the scrolls brother
[3:49] branham god adam speaks crawls into
[3:51] existence bulvar on parole not little
[3:53] parole seeds you know and then Jesus
[3:56] didn't bring fish eggs and wheat seeds
[3:59] you know he multiplied he blessed the
[4:01] bread loaf livia bread and fish right
[4:04] and they came is fully matured fish and
[4:07] loaves yes so there's cases where God
[4:09] for a purpose to prove some point to
[4:11] show something he'll leave it from that
[4:12] but in general the pattern remains the
[4:14] same that it's from a small seed and
[4:16] very slow growth development up so small
[4:19] that that new birth taken place in us we
[4:21] almost don't even detect it sometimes we
[4:23] don't feel like we're making any
[4:24] progress but we're moving little by
[4:26] little we just have to keep going and
[4:28] when we are going to stop so our debt
[4:31] our objective in this lesson I want you
[4:34] to see how God does miraculous things
[4:36] and absolute simplicity and it has a
[4:39] pattern that he follows you carry on his
[4:41] work okay
[4:46] so Isaiah 28 10 you can read the before
[4:50] and after if you want four preset must
[4:52] be upon precept precept upon precept
[4:56] line upon line line upon line here a
[4:58] little and they're little ok very slow
[5:02] growth process spiritually brooke being
[5:08] born again for numbers peter wants my
[5:10] dream not of corruptible seed but I've
[5:13] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[5:16] liveth and abideth forever God comes
[5:19] humble slowly in simplicity just a
[5:23] little bit of time and is not flashing
[5:25] you don't do things to show off yes
[5:27] until things where the Robles Lee what's
[5:28] going on he doesn't care to show off for
[5:30] anybody
[5:36] and you know brother Desmond talking
[5:38] about the body of the Son of Man was
[5:42] produced by was Old Testament prophets
[5:43] you know the foundation the Abraham
[5:46] Isaac Jacob and Joseph made that
[5:48] foundation and then the other prophets
[5:50] that built the body for Jesus coming to
[5:52] then the son of man Jesus he sowed the
[5:54] seeds for our body okay in the four
[5:56] Gospels all that was going on throughout
[5:58] those thousands of years the Old
[6:00] Testament nobody really knew outside of
[6:02] New nobody what was going on that
[6:04] they've been a body built that son of
[6:06] man will get himself a body to be to
[6:07] come here in and then you know the body
[6:11] that that Jesus sowed the seeds for our
[6:13] bodies okay nobody knows what's going on
[6:15] you know I go to work every day I work
[6:18] with a bunch of guys that are you know
[6:20] truck drivers and I'm not even better
[6:21] than them know that separates me from
[6:23] them is my new birth I'll be just the
[6:25] same saving that for the new verse but I
[6:27] sit in that truck at these farms and
[6:28] they're out there clucking like hens
[6:29] you'd be surprised how much like a
[6:31] truckload man can pluck like legs gossip
[6:34] don't sit out there go for hours on end
[6:36] I said oh I read my Bible and someone's
[6:39] growing in me and there's no idea and
[6:41] all of you brushes and brush shoulders
[6:43] with the world every day and everybody
[6:45] was going on it's very secret yes but
[6:48] it's wonderful cuz we know what's
[6:49] happening here identify where for when
[6:51] he cometh into the world he said
[6:53] sacrifice and offering though what it's
[6:54] not better body and stop repaired knee
[6:58] and then we know Ralph merit be drawing
[7:01] 2929 the secret things belong to the
[7:03] Lord our God but those things which I
[7:05] reveal belong to us and to our children
[7:07] forever when they do all the words of
[7:09] this law very secret things that God's
[7:12] kept hits since the foundational world
[7:14] since I can heaven things that have been
[7:16] hidden all doubt their timing slowly
[7:17] bringing it you know to Revelation
[7:20] you're not at that time Matthew 1125
[7:23] that time jesus answered and said I
[7:24] think they'll father or if heaven earth
[7:26] because I hid these things from the
[7:27] hours of the wise and prudent that's
[7:29] revealed them unto babes simple babes
[7:33] very simple
[7:35] not anything great you know very simple
[7:38] I must quote here before he started
[7:42] intellectual lesson vision church age
[7:46] from church a book and now to these sons
[7:48] of God who by him overcome are given the
[7:52] privilege of the paradise of God and the
[7:54] constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ
[7:55] there will never more be any separation
[7:58] from him whether he goes his bride will
[8:00] go what is he is he sheriff with his
[8:03] beloved on a joint heir relationship his
[8:05] secret things will be revealed in a dark
[8:07] tank will be made plain we should know
[8:10] as we're known and we should be like him
[8:12] this is the heritage of the overcomer
[8:14] who has overcome by the blood of the
[8:16] Lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus
[8:19] Christ there's one of the smallest
[8:22] verses in the Bible ten words and in
[8:28] those ten words is an enormous creative
[8:30] act it took place over most of time
[8:32] we've only been here since the fall six
[8:35] thousand years right but science says
[8:38] according to the big bang theory is 13.7
[8:41] billion years ago six thousand years is
[8:44] the money just a few minutes in the
[8:46] scope of all of time and that verse
[8:48] Scofield in the scope of the Bible says
[8:50] gives scope give us a ability for all
[8:53] those geological ages that science says
[8:56] happen over all the billions of years in
[8:59] other words it's possible the bible does
[9:01] not deny what science says about those
[9:04] millions of years after the Big Bang big
[9:06] man itself I believe and the fact I've
[9:08] got taken so many years because the six
[9:11] thousand years or six days of creation
[9:13] in the seventh day he rested was after
[9:15] every after heaven on earth was created
[9:17] then he started working specifically on
[9:19] the herbs okay creating us in the
[9:21] animals and the plants and so forth but
[9:23] up until that time could have been
[9:25] millions of years of being in here
[9:26] you say it was very in the beginning
[9:29] that denotes the beginning of time the
[9:31] starting time in the beginning God
[9:34] created the heaven and the earth and the
[9:36] heaven there means in Hebrew Mexican all
[9:40] right visible heavens the sky the
[9:42] visible universe has all those things
[9:44] God created the heaven and the earth
[9:47] that was an enormous creative that
[9:50] separate from the six days of creation I
[9:52] already said that ok so now I'll do
[10:00] something a little bit different here
[10:01] I've got about eight minutes of a tape
[10:04] play for y'all and y'all ready long Josh
[10:07] for the random talk about this thing for
[10:11] the big man if you consider it their
[10:21] business to the place were can be sure
[10:23] here now the state over critical back
[10:28] row idol a lot of the effects get orange

[10:53] begin now this water made the dispenser
[10:58] look over and see the same time now I
[11:01] know man he's the father area no man can
[11:05] see God in the body for the goal
[11:08] not in body form God in interior then
[11:12] alright though they had seen a bummer
[11:14] but the only begotten of the thought of
[11:16] half a penny for Johnson down step
[11:20] notice now they're done it just fades in
[11:24] July there's no dark just gonna get that
[11:28] these nothing but in there is a glitch
[11:32] supernatural beans yo Olga dogaru cover
[11:38] all face the whole way you will Romero
[11:44] lasting from everlasting he into the
[11:46] gift of bringing that gun tasty nothing

[15:21] we'll talk sure now just saw regarded
[15:23] watchman here it is all about listening
[15:25] years since Thompson then another device
[15:29] called electric world fall for millions
[15:32] of years then stop noticed anyone who
[15:35] pledges didn't now he's got coming any
[15:38] time and what's he doing he's right in
[15:41] first is the first fighter that manner

[16:28] these missiles hanging out there without
[16:30] my boy out of the airport a question
[16:33] first thing you know together the
[16:35] iceberg now that is the further come in
[16:37] transition it's available piece of
[16:39] centered water then we need algebra
[16:42] turning burning block feel completely
[16:47] and kinda at this on top of it it's not
[16:54] like the Beehive know how to play power
[16:57] ballad hologram is probably eight
[16:59] thousand I'll that they brought me a lot
[17:01] of things and it's never been there is a
[17:04] burning bulkini and two-thirds of their
[17:07] then there's end of it in the water and
[17:10] 10 didn't blame about one-third and this
[17:15] will just crushed it living on in full
[17:17] of danger this folding dad nestling oil
[17:21] everything in that line and a to burn
[17:24] notice then it deserves of it water
[17:27] where's the father water simple hydrogen
[17:30] one type oxygens take foliage there's
[17:33] enough like 50 haverhill rooms are
[17:35] separating it from the whole and it may
[17:38] be left like this is at Birth the room
[17:40] did you put under a golf ball Hill New
[17:43] York Alton stay here in the mayor said
[17:47] hello kitty separate entries in fire
[17:49] absorb or better no such a place of
[17:51] elves I got that damn you a little bit
[17:53] we're going to see you're saying or a
[17:55] big pocket area now Norman but now it is
[18:03] a first panel and Jesus powerful away
[18:06] owner I can see move out to the dirdir
[18:08] you go to the top of begin the middle to
[18:12] the Sun is another big ball time and
[18:15] whether it is to get Belton that very
[18:17] big going surfing in a cut through up of
[18:19] our friends and come down and why did it
[18:22] cut out and just texted and all the
[18:25] places there well mentally doable makes
[18:28] it over first thing you know the whole
[18:29] thing with her with water and now we get
[18:33] to Genesis 1 we get diviner however
[18:36] picture tomorrow this one the world
[18:38] without form and void and was upon the
[18:42] face of the future that night and a
[18:44] fears are movable window now he's ugly
[18:48] the water for the you know and so forth
[18:50] drive all vegetation everything boundary
[18:55] to the sea voyage about pack your own
[18:58] blanket they all here okay that wasn't
[19:03] just occupy time look I'm not as dynamic
[19:05] as brother branham so I'll be better
[19:08] this is real then me I'm kind of
[19:10] monotone this is a rimini all know this
[19:14] but we're in a solar system and that's
[19:17] kind of the smallest scale of celestial
[19:19] bodies and a group you know in the
[19:21] universe is a solar system as a central
[19:23] either one or two stars you know some
[19:26] more binary system which means there's
[19:27] two stars in the middle of a bunch of
[19:29] plants but in any case most stars have
[19:30] planets orbiting around that's a solar
[19:32] system you know that I look it up it's a
[19:37] galaxy and it's comprised of about a
[19:41] hundred 100 to 400 billion stars in one
[19:44] galaxy in each of those stars having
[19:46] plants around them we live in the Milky
[19:49] Way galaxy they can't see it science can
[19:51] take a picture out because we're in the
[19:52] middle of it okay you can't send a probe
[19:54] out there it will take one hundreds of
[19:56] thousand years to Center
[19:57] about to get a picture but just to put
[19:59] it in the scale for you this is a called
[20:02] what do you call this of the world noble
[20:05] above spiral galaxy angle whirlpool
[20:08] whirlpool galaxy it's the most kind of
[20:11] like the standard form of most galaxies
[20:13] where it were rolls around like that no
[20:15] sir same space is orbiting or spinning
[20:17] okay if this were our galaxy which is
[20:23] the Milky Way it's a hundred thousand
[20:26] light-years across from this side to
[20:29] that side there's a hundred thousand
[20:30] light-years I mean it takes life 100,000
[20:33] years to go from here to here I'm just
[20:36] trying to show you how small we are now
[20:38] big spaces that God made ok we live
[20:41] about 27,000 light-years out from the
[20:44] galette galactic center which is here I
[20:47] halfway out to the edges where we're at
[20:49] just in our little solar system that
[20:51] might be like to say our little sign
[20:53] there and we're already around it tiny
[20:56] little place and used to give y'all some
[21:01] perspective here now here's where it
[21:03] gets to me more interesting Edwin Hubble
[21:07] you might have heard of Edwin Hubble or
[21:09] the Hubble Space Telescope all right
[21:11] y'all know he lived without looking on
[21:13] board all right if born 89 1889 that's
[21:17] 1953 sort of like brother balance time
[21:20] and we live in eagle age all right in
[21:23] the spiritual and this age we can see
[21:25] further than anybody's ever seen before
[21:27] we can see all down to the church age we
[21:29] can see the range for their day and the
[21:32] message for our day and where we're
[21:33] going right because of you know the
[21:35] Prophet Cohen our age and God revealing
[21:37] to us through him all these wonderful
[21:40] things there's so much spiritual life
[21:42] you know the natural coincide was
[21:44] spiritual so in the natural there's also
[21:46] must be an ability to see further in
[21:49] 1929 those in authority built this
[21:53] Observatory was built on Mount Wilson in
[21:56] California
[21:58] Los Angeles County it was about 30 miles
[22:00] north of Los Santos you know one of the
[22:02] same cities of world they went and built
[22:06] this up on a mountain because as an
[22:09] analogy if you were standing on a
[22:12] swimming pool floor with all the water
[22:14] bubble you look up at the sky everything
[22:15] looks murky because of the water when
[22:18] they're looking out in space with these
[22:19] observatories the atmosphere of the
[22:21] earth all the air molecules keep them
[22:23] from seeing that good it just hinders
[22:25] their vision so they went up above this
[22:27] sin city if you will up on a mountain
[22:29] and build an observatory on Mount Wilson
[22:31] and peered out in space and saw further
[22:34] than man has ever seen in his face
[22:35] before and that man you know this just
[22:38] think spiritual you know then going
[22:39] above all the cinahl this smog fog
[22:42] natural but then although all that sin
[22:44] city to see further than ever and again
[22:47] and they saw further I've inspection
[22:49] every they're trying to prove one thing
[22:51] for years and years men always thought
[22:53] that our galaxy the new brand galaxy but
[22:55] I thought that was the whole universe
[22:56] they said the Milky Way galaxy must be
[22:58] the whole universe that's all there is
[23:00] no other galaxies they want to define
[23:02] him into space they wanted to find where
[23:03] it stops is our galaxy all there is this
[23:06] man was the first one to make this
[23:07] discovery 1929 you know do brother
[23:11] branham's time he saw not this galaxy
[23:17] but he saw one little star you know
[23:20] using a very primitive equipment he
[23:21] couldn't see that whole galaxy but if
[23:22] you see one little star in the corner
[23:24] and he determined the distance of it
[23:28] there's a long story behind how they
[23:29] judge how they mentioned the distance
[23:31] but they found out it was 2.5 million
[23:33] light-years away far beyond our galaxy
[23:36] so this is called the Andromeda galaxy
[23:37] okay and that's the posted Scouts their
[23:41] neighbor galaxy is two and a half
[23:42] million light-years away and he found
[23:44] out from that that we're not alone that
[23:46] our galaxy is not the only galaxy there
[23:49] are other galaxies how many we don't
[23:50] know okay that's that they discovered he
[23:53] made all right now and modern day they
[23:59] built the Hubble Space Telescope on the
[24:01] same premise that they wanted to get it
[24:02] above Earth I'm sure they put it out in
[24:04] space and now Lex even further than ever
[24:06] for this image was taking this and many
[24:08] other images you'll see here in a moment
[24:10] okay now must be able to go okay so now
[24:18] here's from science from the message
[24:22] from the Bible this is the best
[24:24] illustration that i can give you of the
[24:26] Big Bang and of creation this is God
[24:28] acting and creating you I hope you'll
[24:30] see the pattern here so this is what was
[24:33] in the beginning if you can stand there
[24:34] on that banish her brother Brennan was
[24:35] talking about and watch this is what you
[24:37] would have seen invisible just totally
[24:39] there seems nothing it's what brother
[24:41] Brennan said its limbs nothing no space
[24:42] even there was nothing but God dwelling
[24:45] along his attributes and the angles were
[24:46] there right before time again performed
[24:49] the creation angels of where they were
[24:50] God and because he traded them to make
[24:53] to worship him to make him God be
[24:55] already was God he just did you know
[24:57] something to worshipping to declare him
[24:59] to be that well there he was dwelling on
[25:01] with attributes and I think about him
[25:02] being alone morning a wife and God said
[25:05] it's not good that man should be alone
[25:06] on making a lot see so that showed some
[25:08] little part maybe that we can understand
[25:10] in all the long for any years and I
[25:13] wonder why for all those years I want to
[25:14] throw a wife to expand myself to make
[25:17] the family I wanted a family he wanted a
[25:19] family and you know and for many other
[25:21] reasons it's good for man to have a wife
[25:23] well God wanted a bride and that's the
[25:26] point of doing all these things creating
[25:28] all the universe dragging us creating
[25:30] everything he did was opening to get a
[25:31] prize here to share it in yourself with
[25:34] so there I thought in all his attributes
[25:36] and instead
[25:43] now here was powerful the very Spoken
[25:47] Word of God God had thought of creating
[25:48] universe the very Spoken Word of God
[25:50] mixed with the faith of God created the
[25:52] universe he spoke it he thought it he
[25:55] spoke it and then he believed it and
[25:56] nothing could stop from happening then
[26:00] how did that came a big bang now what's
[26:03] interesting what most people don't know
[26:04] the best that I can find let me say some
[26:08] more things about this before i go on to
[26:09] the next slide alright science says this
[26:13] about the only time science says this
[26:17] about the big thing i did it happened
[26:19] very fast it was very intense those in
[26:21] it very intense light very intense heat
[26:23] all of the energy the matter of time
[26:25] itself space and all the four
[26:27] fundamental forces of nature were all
[26:29] contained in one little impetus inspect
[26:31] smaller than an atom brother venom said
[26:33] Adam brush it up John okay whether it's
[26:35] a size and out of our smaller doesn't
[26:36] matter what is it was all in one speck
[26:38] it sounds like dogs pattern was snorting
[26:40] from a seed working his way up brenna I
[26:43] think referred to him as a contractor
[26:44] lane I was building material she just
[26:46] stretched his building materials across
[26:47] space for just eons of time for infinity
[26:50] just stressed everything out late I was
[26:52] building material he started building
[26:53] the ground up who else lived in brother
[26:56] branham's time that was interesting is
[26:58] Einstein just born in eighteen seventy
[27:00] nine left to 1916 365 them what if
[27:04] Einstein gave us the e equals MC squared
[27:05] but they always talks about energy
[27:07] cannot be created or destroyed that's a
[27:09] calculation or only a formula about
[27:12] energy and matter energy can convert to
[27:14] matter and matter can convert back to
[27:16] energy so what was in that little speck
[27:18] how can everything be containing that
[27:20] speck was because it was energy was pure
[27:22] energy God traded it science doesn't
[27:24] know what started that Big Bang back and
[27:26] they can see pretty much holla back to
[27:27] that big bang they don't know what
[27:29] happened before that they don't know
[27:30] that God spoken I'll spoke that into
[27:32] being and then he said let there be and
[27:35] then it broke off and there came
[27:36] creation and energy also took on mass
[27:42] matter and spread out and start to form
[27:44] protons neutrons electrons this camp
[27:47] which became atoms and molecules and
[27:48] gases and stars and planets and so forth
[27:50] okay but it's just unfathomable
[27:54] unfathomable what happened in that
[27:56] personal moment of creation now here's
[27:58] what y'all probably don't know after
[28:01] that a sort of a dark age now I don't
[28:05] know there is any indication in the
[28:06] message if the angels were back there
[28:08] watching this but wouldn't they have
[28:09] been if you're back there with God both
[28:12] the fallen angels I mean well the
[28:14] unfallen angels okay well certainly I
[28:16] would say watching the creation happen
[28:17] and I wonder if you could say maybe that
[28:20] they were beginning to get nervous
[28:21] because here have God had made this
[28:23] wonderful creation just let there be and
[28:24] everything came out from that and also
[28:27] nothing because science says that it
[28:29] went to something called opaque which it
[28:31] means it's invisible nothing going on as
[28:33] far as you can see just like a mixture
[28:34] of really no substance just just like a
[28:38] cloud of nothing just North cloud spread
[28:40] out over space and for hundreds of
[28:41] thousand years there was nothing no
[28:43] light or nothing until stars begin to
[28:45] form from that goals happiness is
[28:47] building returns were laid out and he
[28:49] was forming the building blocks that
[28:50] make up everything little by little okay
[28:53] and I wonder if the Fallen Angels could
[28:56] have seen that and they probably laughed
[28:57] at God and said well he messed up
[28:58] because he created had this big bang and
[29:01] then nothing no sounds like a lot of
[29:02] what God does is happening so subtle
[29:05] that the world that fallen angels can
[29:07] sort of see it happen it takes them off
[29:09] guard I'll have time to give all the
[29:13] particular about this just a few minutes
[29:15] oh I see but then now this that was a
[29:20] this is a computer-generated image of
[29:23] that Big Bang well they think might look
[29:24] like this is the real image from Hubble
[29:27] Space Telescope this is actually early
[29:30] the earliest stars from after the Big
[29:33] Bang these are the early stars began to
[29:35] form the reason we could seem today
[29:36] after 14 billion years is because energy
[29:40] spread out faster than light and went
[29:42] faster than speed like much faster and
[29:43] so the light from those stars that
[29:45] originally formed is just now getting
[29:47] turf okay that's how come they can just
[29:49] now see that in the original after that
[29:52] big bang as these stars no galaxies get
[29:54] their stars you see a lot of gas that's
[29:56] where stars form from is the gas okay it
[29:59] was all floating around gas and dust and
[30:01] so forth began to form in the stars then
[30:07] these are something just taken from
[30:09] Hubble as well of modern-day you know
[30:11] what we can see a bit of galaxies all
[30:14] across the sky and they say that there
[30:19] are about all together something like
[30:21] 100 billion galaxies in the whole
[30:24] universe in the observable universe but
[30:26] they can see with modern day technology
[30:27] 100 million each of them with several
[30:30] hundred billion stars in there and then
[30:34] this is taking us some kind of a some
[30:39] kind of a light radiates there's
[30:40] different forms of life that we can't
[30:41] see that's out there in the universe
[30:42] there's a whole big spectrum of life
[30:44] that's not visible all right only a
[30:47] portion of the visible with telescopes
[30:48] so they have to use infrared telescopes
[30:50] ready radio telescopes and so forth and
[30:53] they can see that these galaxies these
[30:56] are galaxies that are connected sort of
[30:57] in a way of that you know science didn't
[31:01] know that until during the last ten or
[31:02] twenty years and so in the big slope of
[31:05] things this is the web of the universe
[31:08] of all the galaxies combined and you
[31:10] would say you know in ours isn't shown
[31:12] on here this is where they've taken it
[31:13] in of an image proton space but just to
[31:16] prove a point arge might be this one
[31:18] little speck might be our guy
[31:20] and inside that one respect and on
[31:22] corner that speck is our son and outside
[31:25] of that little son is our earth but
[31:27] God's whole focused out of all this his
[31:29] whole focus is is centered on that one
[31:31] little speck over in the corner you know
[31:33] that's where all God's focus is and has
[31:35] been for all the time to try to get a
[31:37] product that's pretty much my whole
[31:41] lesson so now I'm going to just show you
[31:43] all some other slides that might
[31:45] interest you this is another picture
[31:48] taken of a galaxy from I don't know
[31:51] which one that would be much what that's
[31:53] called but you can see all these
[31:55] billions of stallers whirling around
[31:58] mountains base fascinates me I've always
[32:02] been so fascinated with space because my
[32:04] god make this and you make for purpose
[32:06] you know and I believe someday will be
[32:09] able to you know when we travel like a
[32:11] thought and I wouldn't be surprised if
[32:12] in eternity if we could travel out these
[32:14] on these things I love me this is a this
[32:16] is a black hole surrounded by the matter
[32:18] that's being pulled into it let's say
[32:20] that every galaxy has a black hole in
[32:21] the middle of that's what kind of holds
[32:23] things together a black hole is where
[32:25] her son has gotten so big that it
[32:26] collapsed on itself the gravity is too
[32:28] strong and it collapses well then when
[32:31] it does it forms like a negative
[32:32] whatever antimatter or whatever and it
[32:35] cools the other stores and things in on
[32:37] it and converts matter back in energy
[32:40] this is pure energy shooting back out
[32:42] into space which eventually turns into
[32:43] other stars back in the matter that's
[32:46] just energy and life or they were broken
[32:48] down from there and that's two galaxies
[32:52] somewhere that have collided coalesced
[32:54] or whatever they call me these are
[32:57] images in space of dust and gas these
[33:01] are probably most of these you would see
[33:03] or several hundred thousand light years
[33:05] in size you know you fit several of our
[33:08] galaxy's inside of some of these clouds
[33:11] of dust that come out of nebulae where
[33:12] stars are born gases and things are
[33:15] floating around where stars are born I
[33:17] don't know how many gods ever seen and
[33:20] these things but these are
[33:21] immaculate and our God is the one that
[33:25] created all this and other nebulae where
[33:28] stars being born gases helium hydrogen
[33:31] gas and so forth and it's interesting to
[33:34] me that a lot of these you can see some
[33:35] figures some forms you know brother
[33:37] branham saw that and many people saw
[33:40] that cloud that uh you know with the
[33:42] pillar that cloud that descended and how
[33:46] all those figures in it and a lot of
[33:47] these you can say some figured I don't
[33:49] know if there's a significant say that
[33:50] I'm just saying but there's a lot of
[33:51] figures that you can see in many of
[33:53] these things just like in our daytime
[33:56] sky you can look going to see a lot of
[33:57] things where there's any thing to that
[33:59] or not as a nebula where stars are born
[34:02] a star being born that is a many of them
[34:05] in space look like a giant I just a
[34:08] teacher hydrogen helium gases Oh crown
[34:12] and this is just many many galaxies and
[34:16] stars having space right mm-hmm I
[34:19] fastest will people like 186,000 miles
[34:22] per second I didn't ever say that sorry
[34:25] needed it 186,000 miles per second
[34:28] between play is a speed of light if you
[34:30] want to talk about the best mrs. face
[34:31] and so like I said our galaxy if you
[34:34] look at this being our galaxy right
[34:39] there so basically this is Milky Way
[34:42] galaxy it's 100,000 100,000 light years
[34:45] across so like troubling hundred
[34:47] eighty-six thousand miles per hundred
[34:49] and eighty-six thousand off per second
[34:51] goes across month or something like this
[34:54] you can see it moving Arlene that's how
[34:57] much space is and you know it took a big
[35:00] God to make a big space like a fair God
[35:02] put that into perspective you can go
[35:05] around this earth seven and a half
[35:07] the one second with lot yet like yeah so
[35:12] we think we're baking something weird on
[35:14] we're nothing we're a tiny little speck
[35:15] and getting gone thanks so much else
[35:17] yeah that's what makes monochrome cry
[35:18] like a baby sometimes because i think
[35:20] you know Jesus a heaven earth will pass
[35:22] away heaven earth in the beginning God
[35:24] created the heaven Jesus turning said
[35:26] heaven earth will pass away my world
[35:27] never passed away I don't believe he
[35:28] meant that all of this will pass i want
[35:30] to make it just to destroy i think he
[35:32] meant that the sin will be burned all
[35:33] through all those things you know even
[35:35] the earthy is going to maintain it but
[35:36] the frame oh but he's got to burn the
[35:38] sin off oh and we'll draw here first
[35:40] trip but you know there's a wonderful
[35:41] universe out there to enjoy you know
[35:43] just look up some time on google topping
[35:46] hubble space telescope in you'll be
[35:48] really amazed at what god has done and
[35:50] it's right around this whole time i just
[35:52] think about ssl having having questions
[35:59] compression two things without a purpose
[36:02] in there right when we get there we'll
[36:04] know
[36:06] exactly he's kind of purpose for all so
[36:09] okay thank y'all folks if you have any
[36:16] questions on that simulates question
[36:19] makes a bit of where we're at so far not
[36:23] what we're going to move beyond
