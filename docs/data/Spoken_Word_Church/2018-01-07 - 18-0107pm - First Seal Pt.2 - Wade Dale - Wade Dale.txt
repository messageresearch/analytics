========================================

please end of troubles friends I've said my fear but heaven eternal at the end of my journey will be worth every mile of the truth like a herpe pilgrim who thrived on the shore and forgot how the waves tossed his sheep if I could see Jesus smile him say well done child to be worth every mile of the trip I've been on the mountains and I've walked through the valleys and of Troubles friends I've

Jesus smile him say well done child to be worth every mile of the tree well I've stood at the bedside of a Christian tea party and I've heard these lights words from his leaves I see the crystal

I'm getting my nest fixed back up here it's been a month or so since I've been up here and they've been all playing up here so I can only stuff back in line here get all this stuff together so good to be here good the holidays are over I enjoy them as much as anybody but I'm sure glad to have all the have all of our star players back you know everybody here and doing what they're supposed to be doing and we love the support that we have here we love everyone all of you every one of you that are here so I got a couple things I want to share with ya I was thinking of the new year and you know what what brother Brown said about so I was back there they don't have this one in the back but I want to read this this is really interesting their brother branham in 1964 yeah please it's warm up here in Shalom 1964 brother Brown said this was 12 which was 112 but he's so much the new year he says not turn a new page it's turned to the word see what the word promises for today see what a lot of the day is supposed to be what we ought to do this year is not go back to Creed's and things go back to our old denominations not go back to our old denominations but turn to the word see what kind of a light is supposed to shine today old church turned to the word go back to the word flip the right switch quit punching around on electrical lights see artificial man-made turn to his word and see the promise of today and then see what the promise is and watch for its identification when it's vindicated then you know whether you're in the light or not see what the promise is changing the pages our changing calendars doesn't change time we can take up a calendar and put one up and take one down put one up changing the pages or changing calendars doesn't change time a lot of people say well the old years gone throw away the old December calendar now and put up the new one other one the new year that's what New Year's means to them to me this is where we get to me I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the road I am as Paul said I could stand quoting again forgetting those things which are in the past now I press toward the mark the high calling to the complete identification he said that three or four times to complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes man what a holiday you know when we go to millennium that's going to be a holiday we don't have anything to do it's a holiday and it's not gonna be where we come to the end of the holiday brother Damian we got to go back to work and then like in the post office you get all this stuff piled up at the end and you just soon work during the holiday as you had work today after because you're doing two or three different days in one day but but this holiday that we're gonna be on for a thousand years it's gonna be a millennium it's gonna be one where you don't have to worry about nothing not one thing are we told that we're to worry about a man now the Jews they've got you know they've got to be there's a king there there's son of David not but us we're on there brother brown called in honeymoon which is a holiday vacation all right so we'll be there for a thousand years so that's one I want to look for I want to look for that one make sure I don't miss that one doesn't matter about these holidays but don't miss that one I'm in and I also saw a quote that I really like listen this said start by doing what's necessary then do what's possible and suddenly you are doing the impossible amen and song now in radio where God were impossible as God's reality you think about all things God's done it's impossible that a virgin was to conceive it's impossible that what you're standing don't come from nothing that's an impossibility to you and I it was an impossibility for God to give you the new birth because it was all contrary but that impossible become a reality when you put God into when you put God into it then that's to me that's the factors when you put God like this quote here in this new year we make resolutions that we break the next day don't make any new year's resolution just do like a prophet of God said look for the identification of your hour this is 2018 never been here before my brother Dale said just stick close we've never been this way before but you know what somebody has God's already been through this whole thing and man so he's the one that's gonna lead us through so if you got your Bibles we turn to the Book of Revelations and we'll back in December the second the last time we spoke we were talking about this first seal but we're gonna continue but we're doing some backgrounding this morning or this afternoon to just kind of get us all back into the into the lineup so revelation 6 verse 1 also remember that this coming Thursday I'll be leaving for Minnesota just prayed that we don't get froze in because this is a high up there's been in the teens and the minuses so there's pectin snow Thursday but we're going up to see brother rush dunker he's been watching in our services and we're gonna have some fellowship with him and then brother Jason DeMars has asked me to speak at his church up there in Minnesota on Sunday so I'll be there Sunday speaking for them and coming back on Monday so this keeps thinking prayer that we don't get stuck in Minnesota no offense but I like it down here this is home and also remember on February the 25th we'll be in Mobile Alabama at brother Matthew braze and I want to thank you all for the cards and the gifts and the letters and all the things that we got for Christmas and I what brother Dale gave us for Christmas thank him and I appreciate all of you we just I told them downstairs and and I mean this this is the family I have I'm fortunate to have a family that's in the message and some of you are not but I'm glad that we have the church family all back together the church family is the most important we can communicate where you can't communicate we'll give your real family I mean honestly you know you you love them you love them with all your heart but there's just no communication there when you're of two different opinions or two different minds you know so but it's good to be because you know we're gonna spend eternity with this family it's an eternal family that we're born into so let's go to revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you'd be with us today truly this is a new year a new time that will let the things in the past be passed and we'll press Lord toward the mark of the high calling see our identification for this age see the light that is shine for us Lord in this endtime forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick be the ones on the highways Lord be with the ones that are in the fields with missionaries doing their work Lord give them fruit for the labor bless the ones Lord there in India that's having some problems there with the orphanages and things Lord the brother Boaz has been sending us some messages Lord we pray that you would intervene because all things are possible to them that believe when we look at the impossible we know that there's a possible God behind all these things forgive us of our sins bless this day in Jesus name Amen and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as a word the noise of thunder now you're not gonna hear that again it doesn't thunder it ever seal ok got it when you heard the noise of the Thunder we'll get to that a little while maybe later on the next message one of the four beasts saying come and see so there's a there's a beast involved we'll get into all those symbols in just a little while I'll put the board up in a minute but I want to background first before we do that I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him now look watch these things that were given a crown was given to this person he didn't have one he was given one and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the world at his blessing to the reading of the word I just want to like I said we're gonna background for a little while and then we will look at some of these symbols I want to want you to remember one thing that the thing that we thought all these years may not be exactly the way we should see it because when we get involved with these with the opening of the seals we know as as brother Dale has already taught us over and over and over and over again that the seals are for Redemption purpose not to not to so much and it does the Bible does say reveal the wicked one it does it makes known who he is but this this that we're talking about is a revelation of Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis to revelations that's why one seal can tie the entire book of the Bible two books of the Bible together because if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again alright so if Christ is the seals then you ought to be able to go to Genesis wanted to read the seals and then you should go to Jeremiah and read the seals and you should go to Isaiah and read the seals because you watch brother branham uses many scriptures when he's going through the seals many scriptures all over the Bible many many scriptures he uses he doesn't just use one or two or three he uses an entire I mean all the way over into Jeremiah and the ones using the where they put the scrolls and the earthen vessels he brings that into the seals because Michael they were sealed up and then they were what made known they were taken out opened up and read all right which were the scrolls that they put in earthen vessels which is this earthen vessel that we're looking at here all right so we're just gonna background real quick let's go to Matthew 24 verse four and let's read what as keep these things in the back of your mind the seals have already been preached Matthew 24 Jesus steps forward and he doesn't step forward and say the white horse rider is all right the black horse rider is no one I don't think no one knew that until brother Branham even comes to what is it the sixth seal fifth seal six seal and the Lord reveals to him what he's preaching has already been spoken in the book of Matthew by the Lord Jesus himself brings the six seals because remember they asked him they said what what's the sign of your coming when's the end and all these things they asked him those three questions and he answered them under the what under the seals because he said right here right here's where the first one in jesus answered or sent unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many all right and we know that that's exactly what happened he was telling us that Satan now remember as brother Dale hit on a little bit this morning there's always twins so there's always gonna be one a dark side and the light side just like you know you'd see you movies of the jedis and all the force and black force and white force there's always two forces there's only two forces all right so any time we read the Bible though I steam like this yesterday anytime you read the Bible there's an opposition as Bob was talking this morning and brother Branham says any time a prophet hits the earth there's a war right now watch the war he's not warring with itself God doesn't war with God if the devil comes on the scene now remember he's a copycat so that doesn't mean he jumps on the scene first God's always doing something first so when you see these seals and you see a wild horse rider and you see all these things know one thing's for sure God is already working God's already got a white righteous church on the earth for him to be in opposition I was you know you look at an image you know you look at an image well well now in the age of photoshopping see we've come to the end time now to where we're really all things are possible even now even in the physical realm they can take somebody that that's that doesn't look very well and make them look very well why by photoshopping that's the way Satan does he what he takes the image of God and distorts it or changes it now look when God said let us make man in our image he didn't change one thing he made man in His image now what Satan does what we were we were talking about the other day female or a woman was created by God amen and then brother Brown said Satan is her designer now he didn't say Satan was her creator he said Satan was her designer what do you do he took what God had already made he took the image that was already made and what do you do he perverted it he took it to the mental part look at it now it's a woman's age a woman's wear woman rules everything right because she knows how because Satan has an auditor a man Satan has an auditor to know how to do that God's not anointing her to pervert people god never anoints you to provide if you if something is anointed and it becomes perverted no one think god's not in that now God's the original maker but Satan is the original pervert ur right and that's the same way with these seals for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many take heed that no man deceive you so in other words what's he saying he's saying that there is a mirror image coming that's gonna try to deceive you that's gonna try to pervert you that's gonna say I am Christ that's my brother branham they asked him about Thessalonians there was was that the man of sin was that the first seal he said sure there's your mystery of iniquity there's your mirror image of it looks like God but it's not and that's the most deceptive if what's not deceptive is the guy in the bar the prostitute in the prostitute house that's not deceiving if when you move them under the auspice or under the Church amen under the church then when you put them under the church and then Satan perverts by a religious perversion which is worse than anything that's why to me the seals is a complete plan of redemption because we've been under this yeah we have yeah we have Martin Luther didn't have the complete Word of God he had a part that he played right and like brother Brown said in this in the one I read about the the the New Year Lucas all the light he was in and that's what he lived in that's all he had to live in we were talking about yesterday and I believe this is really important up until at from Adam to this day even you take through Jesus Christ there is no greater time than today that's why the prophet of God said all the prophets look to this day even Jesus Christ pointed to this day he told us what to look for but in that day that Jesus himself the headstone himself walked on the face of the earth he had nobody you saw no he had yeah he had a physical body he didn't have a church body to work through right he even saved anybody when he was here right but then on the day of Pentecost is when the body began to build but what was missing the head was gone the head was going off to the church ages so you had a body with no head I mean you had a head with no body when Jesus was here because Jesus had to leave go away and came back into the body and work through the body but now in the end time the body and the head is to you not amen that's never happened before ever I was thinking this morning they what brother Dale was preaching every human has been born through it alone except by them but it had to be Christ Bob was talking about this morning where the scripture in Romans 8 and I had never seen it in that light before which is good that's why we have a fivefold ministry that's why we have people that teach that's why we have because look why when you're birthed into the body of Christ you don't cry mama mama what do you cry daddy daddy Abba Father because all men born of a woman is dead even Jesus was born of the woman in his body died hey man but if you're born of a man and I just read that yesterday where brother mom said if you're born of a woman you die if you're born of a man you live right so this new birth the brother Dale is talking about this new birth that's coming in it's not a woman birth I thought the scripture said come out of her my people come out of her what the woman come out of heard you say what's this got to do with the seals it's got a lot to do with it because you got to come out of that to see the truth but come out of her my people and what be borne by the man Adam was not born by a woman he was born by a man you said born yo he was full-grown but he came from a man and even when the Bible says that what our mother is New Jerusalem which is the word well the words not a female the words of male and man now we are female in the body you don't get me wrong but our birth is not from a woman that's why Nicodemus couldn't understand he said but I got to go back to a woman and be born if I got to go back to my wife my momma Jesus said I ain't talking about your momma right I'm know about your daddy you gotta be born from your daddy which is above a man same thing with these sales then we have we see that the sales then is what a man right now there's an impostor man but there's a real man that all that comes from a man there's a real man there's a father there's an a by father when we're birthed into the family of God it's by man not a female not a denomination because that's what females are right female denomination or church all right do that all right say a man but remember he says I am Christ and shall deceive many so so you take what Satan is doing and we look in these cells that when the lamb opened the seal we and we from way back several months ago we know that that seal that was of around that piece of this remember the seal is what was tore off all right well the seal part is what we're going to look at as far as the symbols brother Graham called actors players those different things actors and players players of apart actors of a part all right because remember you and I are not actors actors somebody you hire an actor is somebody that comes in and acts the part of someone else now see that's our problem are we acting the part of someone else or are we that person in another form called a bride which is the woman which is fine with me but we came from a man we can come from a woman that Genesis 1:26 never come from a woman he came from man speaking and saying let there be amen that's the same way when the seals were open they were opened by the man Christ Jesus not william branham they were opened by God himself and then why because let me just be honest because Satan was in the pulpit hey man Satan was in the pulpit Satan was doing the preachers listen Jesus Christ God Almighty whatever you want to call him he never preached the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism never cause it's contrary but Satan made it look so good to what the people accepted it there's a deception the people accepted what was already been said like we're talking about the Nicene counsel you know from from through whatever it was 300 and some 325 AD it took 600 for them to develop that and make it something we'll get into that with the seals because remember starts as a saying what do you think about what well that sounds good brother I think I'll take it to this one and then I think I'll take it to this one and Satan says who feel that feels good ain't got nothing do females feels good I think I'll tell it to this one yeah see what I'm saying then what it become a what a saying then he'd become a deed then it became a doctor that's what's bothering me and you now is that some of the things that we heard we'd become indoctrinated with hey man that's my problem I'm talking about me you worry about your own self but I know my me that's my problem I'm indoctrinated with things I need to get rid of let's read in Ephesians 1 verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom that's what I want to this is my this is my Commission to you as we go through these seals cuz look they've already been open they've already been preached Jesus preached them brother Branham preached him brother Dale's preached them in the 80s and in my feeble way I'm gonna try to just stir up your mind just bring them back together and stir up your mind cuz you've already heard these things but watch but I want this to happen they give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen so let's remember one thing if Satan's got any power it's given to him but remember you and I have an inheritance that his power waste it is power it is the power of God unto salvation the Bible says it is the power that God gives what a son and daughter now Satan gets the permittee power that God permits him to have a power to what I believe so that God can prove that we can live in these bodies and that we can receive revelation and that God can change these bodies that have come from a woman and a man getting together and Raptors all impossible that we can take a body change impossible yeah the way we look at it brother dick I was looking at the picture of you this morning it's highly impossible that he can take a body change go I saw him when he was 8 years old he liked it now there were some pigs in front of it but then pigs are dead gone brother dick still here the pigs have been eating what I'm saying is that we are we are showing that the curse is still here in our human body but when are we going to say that's not so Phil I was telling telling dad we were we were going down to the hunting club or something I said that's it truly truly Abraham son Isaac came by promise by faith he didn't have to have faith with Hagar that was a natural act that he could perform that produced a child there's no faith in that after he had after he had Isaac let's jump on over to the 7 he got back term by young again he made another wife and guess what they wasn't by faith they had separate more kids but Isaac was by faith it was impossible for Abraham and Sarah to have kids even when they were young so he had to believe not with Hagar not with what but what was right there in front of him right there's no way I can do this Lord but I believe what you said now that's what you and I got to come to the impossible is why I said the impossible is his reality there's no way you see a 99 year old man and a woman coming in they're going to the gynecologist to get a due date come on really go change them back the young man and woman and then change her womb so that she can have what the promised child it came by promise these sails will open to you by promise what do you need faith when you got good health what do we need faith when we can order a steak and baked potato and boy Red Lobster mm-hmm yeah what's that mean really honestly what's that about faith there's not faith there's no faith in that that's why we've got to be the children of we got to see the promise that our that our focus is not that we're gonna make a lot of money or that we're gonna lose a lot of money our focus is not that we got a good car not a good car our focus this is where we can get our body change and get out of here hey man that's the boss get the data out of the ground first and I believe these seals is what's gonna hold us in to that I believe that like I said on I'll read it in just a minute after I read about four or five quotes remember I read it to you before the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for your soul your soul is redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ I brother Chris did an awesome job about salvation and brother Dale has been doing the same thing because they come together and did a real good job their salvation is of the Lord you believe on what God did at Calvary the seals are for the redemption of your body the seals are only when that head and the body unites in this end time it's never been revealed ever before never but that's our Commission our commission is to take this like we've seen in Bible study last night it's not me it's not you it's the body of Christ believing that that promised son is going to come through us not through someone else through eyes all right let's do a number one first steel man is hot up here and at the end of the pen council age we're supposed to receive according to the word is God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that we know where the messenger come in right we know who the messenger was he delivered his message all right because remember when Moses went off the scene and Joshua took over that didn't just take away their problems as soon as he stepped over into the Promised Land there was all the mites came up and he had to fight them all and I've been reading through the kings and all that man they fought Wars every day my brother Tom said it's just war stories that war right after another they kill a king and bring a king they kill the prince and bring another one they killing and Kemp and got in town go kill them all okay but we this end time is we're killing demons we're not killing people okay we're killing demons the demons that I have they gotta be dead you got to figure out what pick what demons you bothers you and then receive a messenger that will take all these loose ends what I'm saying is even when Joshua got in the promised land they fall they fought they fought Wars you and I have got to overcome more than anybody's ever overcome amen and I believe when we see these seals open it shows that that you've got all your combat beats they're working for you they're working they're working for you because when they're gone we're going now I love that when they're gonna work amen so they're here now with us and then we're gone they leave with us receive a messenger that will take all these loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the writing of the church so in other words bring it all together and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right now look Jesus preached the first seal and never said anything about a while wars writer amen so there must be something hid under there that we must see that when the Prophet brings it it opens it we see what's going on we see now I don't mean say I mean understand when I say see you got to know I mean to understand all right we've been looking at these letters for what 60 something years these letters seeing them but we must see them with our soul see them with the understanding of our heart amen and then there's coming because remember it's like I told you many many times before we must see the essence of the message because you can take this quote right here and I'll find you one that says the seven thunders is not that you know you can always find an opposite well who's finding the opposite if there's only to Louise there's only two who's finding the opposite if God is the truth if you find an opposite it's not God opposing itself you see where we see that that thing's got to be riding away from amen then that's coming for seven mystère stunners it's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith now there's that faith of Abraham that father of our faith listen he was the father not the mother he was the father of our faith you can get something with that Bob you just wait because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find words written all right so we'll continue on with the next quote number number two still in the first seal now the Seventh Seal roll book is now being released by the RAM we approached that place tonight god help us as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed now we see this as a seal you see this is a sealed book now we believe that do we not we believe that it is a sealed book now we know we never know this before but it is it's sealed with seven seals that is on the back of the book the book is sealed with seven seals all right excuse me if we was talking about this kind of book it would be like putting a strap around until my list book seven straps but it isn't that kind of book it's a scroll remember it rolled up and then when the scroll is unwound that's one then laying right in the scroll is number two I you know you say what what seals the most important well I believe the first seal is the most important because if that first seal didn't open the second one's not going to once that scroll is open Bojan once that Scrolls open you got one two three four you're just sitting there reading you're just sitting there reading them but if that number once closed up and that seals on it I don't care what you do you can't thumb through there and find two and three and four you got to get number one that's why the thunders sounded on that first seal you ma'am then you can see that as that book is open then the seals tore off you just start flipping pages because you already Saul ready open how you gonna understand too if you don't get one you just can't if we were talking about this kind of book we'd put a strap on it but it isn't that kind of book it's a scroll and when the scroll is unwound that's one then laying right in the scroll is number right in the scroll is number two right here it says what it is but it's a mystery but yet we have proved in it but remember the book is sealed in the book is a book of mystery of what revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ see the book of Revelation and now you know down to the age man has probed and tried to get into it we all have all right number three now these the ones I'm gonna read you talking about what these seals are cuz we can't we got to know what they are for we get started all right everybody say ma'am we got a few sleep cuz not me but it's the holy spirit the very angel of God that you see what about these days here when all these things taking place now this is before the seal is open this 1961 this is the preaching of the church ages okay okay this is the place preaching the church age and this angel the Lord standing here I wouldn't know these things but it's the hour it's here when we get through those seven spirits the seven horns and things today if the Lord willing you'll see where it's at it's the hour that we're in that these revelations are supposed to come it's the Book of Revelations they're revealing of Jesus Christ and we find out the very first chapter he revealed who he was and now he's getting the seven seals revealing how he redeemed the earth not how he redeemed Satan no no how he redeemed the earth what earth the ball were standing on Nick not yet this fell first then the earth fell so guess what then this has got to be redeemed and then that'll be redeemed so that's what the seals are to do reveal how he redeemed the earth is that Alright amen now let's go to the next one read these real quick standing down here works not so hard they six inches right there and that six inches makes a big difference in the temperature they died and brother Deaton you all know it big time so I'm gonna stand in here for a minute John tells us here in Revelation that the enemy and the last day that religious enemy would get amongst people I'm reading down here this paragraph from him and have organizations and so forth and cults and so forth as they have had today and would deceive the very elect if it were possible and it would deceive all those whose names are not put on the lounge laughs that's the very foundation of the world when was your name put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we know that when was Christ slain 1990 years ago no sir before the foundation of the world the lamb slain before the foundation won their watch see what it's doing it's the seals opening up just beginning to reveal the plan of the devil that's not what this is oh it says revealed the plan of what redemption how he did it it's all over now just about just about finished up so we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed why some plan of redemption amens all right the plan of redemption now number the next one number five Gables instructions to Daniel now that we find that he has our kinsman he was our kinsman redeemer and he took a book out of the hand of the original owner it is the title deed to redemption we found out you remember the study it's a title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life or death in the Garden of Eden then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to what break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance we've read this quote before and give the inheritance that belong to him to his people what is it eternal life that he inherited by doing that now he didn't inherit eternal life in his soul he was eternal life he didn't inherit eternal life in his spirit because he was the holy spirit but he needed that he turned life in his body so what are these cells for they're for the redemption of our body eternal life that he inherited by doing that he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it among us by the Holy Ghost amen no man has ever been able to come to even think of the love that that was what he done and there's not listen we're self as a bunch of people bottom line we're selfish bunch of people sure we and we might even wouldn't give our life for somebody else but my life can't go back into the person to save them that's why Christ had to come he come through a woman sure but he wasn't born of a woman the man created the egg and the man created the germ user is an oven so he could be our what kinsman-redeemer hey man she was an avid that's what she was she was an incubator when brother mom said the incubator what is that it's an oven that keeps something that lined me something degrees until it right keeps it warm thank you sister keeps it warm why because it's the widest its life a seed brings forth of its common so we knew that but to be a kinsman redeemer he had to come that way amen but he wasn't born of a woman right he was born of a man the man put the egg there not man let's adjourn there evening I mean Mary didn't have nothing to do with it just the oven and then well I'm sorry did I say incubator some of y'all laughing what's the difference you take an incubator what does an incubator do when I when I raised queen bees I got to keep him at 94 degrees I put him in an incubator you know what I could put him in an oven what does it matter what's the difference she was an incubator she was an oven what to get him here so that he could look at us and say I am like you I got a flesh body like you got I am your brother I read the quote yesterday where brother mom said in his body he was human he had to eat he had to sleep they certain certain things he had to do as a human you know why cuz he that makes him close to us Oh God but close to us everywhere God but ever went man's we still don't get that rock he was gone almighty in human flesh if you're born again today guess what you're in human flesh because you were born from a man the right way we're my number five or number six no number says get this right here at the fourth seal that's the way the church ages in the seals and all the rest of it and when anybody thinks that he has those seven thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word now my contention is the seven thunders are in the Word of God it's just not one two three four like the seals are why call this a hidden mystery nobody's ever known Amen but it's like to me it's laced in the entire word of God from Genesis to Revelation because in Genesis you got a body change I just talked about Abraham that's in the book of Genesis he took a body shame when he might has those seven thunders if they don't compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong here that's why my contention that the seven thunders or redemption not how to not how to speak something into existence or speak something out of existence that's all in there but those thunders is for if to get this body lined up see it's got to come thus saith the Lord for this is the book this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in its entirety that's your seals right there that's your thunders - alright number seven in Isaiah now watch Isaiah spoke of the sick sail read it what you prophet you said in Isaiah let's take this Isaiah the prophet seen this sick seal open it's all through the word vote Isaiah saw the six he'll look only goats but lamb say thank you Lord and you go he sent you this what you Prophet said why because what and a prophet is what the prophets a seer he can see he saw that six he'll open and spoke of it and I'll bring the scripture later on but it's not part of it today that's whether it's important or not see well the whole thing the whole plan of redemption lays under these seals the whole plan of redemption why because in the Bible there is an earnest there's an earnest when you get born again that's your honest but they're at what until the full possession the full part of redemption lie brother now said this morning when we won't step over into another dimension in a new body this body changed when we step over into another dimension redemption for us is over right okay the whole plan of redemption lays under these seals the whole book what am I telling you pull up the next one Redemption Redemption Redemption think of Redemption when we're sure we're gonna go to the symbols of the wars we're gonna go through the bowl and the crown was given and how to conquer and all those things but to me that's to show this is all remember this is all opposition this is not God in revelation 6:1 you understand I'm saying this is not God this is the devil and what he's doing but remember sealed up under that it's what God's already been doing all right you can't have a white horse oh why brother Brown said a white righteous seemingly a white Rogers Church there had to be a white Rogers Church on the earth for Satan to copy from a man there had to be a red of blood ball Church there had to be black there had to be all the different symbols because remember let's just read it this is my quote I couldn't find brother Brown say this but I'm going to say it this way the break in the seals are not necessary for the salt your shoulders redeemed by the new birth shed blood of Jesus cross at Calvary amen most people I'm telling you 99% of the people in Christendom since the day of Pentecost until today are not going to see the opening of the seals in its entirety hold on the men though they're gonna be a recipient of it hello unless the seals break to somebody and they become a new body on right here standing on this part then people in the sixth dimension are not coming here right so there are a recipient of the opening of the seal that's why I said not necessarily for the salt but remember their soul their soul is redeemed there there's redeemed as they'll ever be but their bodies on this side their souls over there their bodies on this side their bodies waiting for this earth to be redeemed and then what they're gonna step over here pick up their body 30 40 days then we're all gonna go we're going what we're not going up we're gonna step over another dimension I was thinking something the other day somebody was mentioning infinity the other day and I thought you know since the beginning of time how many children just children that's under the age of accountability have died are gonna be in heaven billions billions and then we say well the earth is four-fifths water and once you make them all land we can all fit what does it matter what does it matter if infinities infinity we're one dimension you can step in and they'd be ten billion people and you step right back over another dimension they'd still be in people then you step over in another dimension they stand being people this earth can hold an innumerable amount of people you step over another dimension I believe we'll be able to do that hey man I'm telling you that's what I see but look but we'll bring full fellowship in the manifestation because remember when those people went across the curtain of time sure they were in full fellowship with each other think about this Christ was not there in his person you understand I mean he was that is listen that is the person of Christ those people but I'm talking about the literal man the one we long to see how long to see my lover I long to see my husband the one that's slapped me about and kept me straight I want to see him I want to see the man that's done all this work but they didn't see him brother Bram said where's Jesus the angel said he's a little high that's where we want to go right there go see he's got a glorified body these people don't have a glorified body they got to do like he did he had to come back here to get his body come on right he had to come back here to get his body go that term is as empty that term is empty there's no flesh in there because it's now glorified in walking in all the dimension but it's not in a sixth dimension why because they're not complete they're not exactly they're not complete without coming back because he's standing somewhere in a flesh body flesh I'm from my flesh buddy eternal glorified and they're not there in an eternal soul amen but they're not totally redeemed hey man cuz they got to come back here and connect back to the earth amen get their glorified body step into it and then do like Jesus now listen Jesus walked 30 to 40 days in a glorified body on this earth in Satan's domain highly impossible the way we think it but remember with God all things are possible he walked through here for 30 40 days he communed with him he ate remember he even fixed fish for him on them on the shore we sing the song coming down he told him they were out there fishing he said coming down talk to Peter talk to him all told him what to do told him what was going on told him and then he laughed and he said in other words I'll not see you anymore the way you see me now but when you do see me we'll all be back together again and that's what we're doing now that's why we now are the hinge point of this whole thing we're the keystone of this whole thing that's why brother Branham had to bring the message here planted in our heart and then let the Holy Ghost work because remember you can grieve the Holy Ghost you you can have as much of God as you want he's not gonna open your brain I wish he'd opened my head up pour it in sometimes but you know what we couldn't stand it he knows the end from the beginning he knows what you can stand and what you can't stand so what are these seals it's to bring full fellowship into manifestation what in this dimension Cosi they didn't get it in that dimension they died and went on perfect and God complete in that dimension I said complete and they're not totally because they don't everybody but completing God that God said I'm finished with you on this in this dimension I'm done you're done you've done everything you can do now I'm gonna put you in a place of rest I'm gonna put you in a place of rest why do we grieve because people die why do we agree I know the separation in our mind and the and but that's all human that's the human emotion but the one just went on I'm sure we grieve when we cry and we wonder why but man to beat it's like brother Brown said he looked back and saw that saw that nasty he called it all kind of things what good right he said that corrupt he kept calling it yet he said why do I want to go back to that because he was over here in perfection but not full completion and not full fellowship because you know what you know what they're not sitting over there twiddling their thumbs no Gary Atkins is going what do you think about that yeah you always do that he woke up me go what do you think about that and him and Marlo's over there singing and you know they're doing things but you know what they're waiting they're not in a place of perfect rest they're in the place of rest the perfect rest is when we come back here and then we step over in another dimension let God clean this thing off and then we're gonna step back in the millennium and like I said what a holiday what a day when you don't have to worry about what's our problem right now if I were to preach till nine o'clock won't be a problem number want to be mean I've got make a list Julie make a list I got to pick up Luke I got I got right I got to make sure the and I got to cook and I write you would start thinking this is the things I got to do tomorrow but what about if you had none of that tomorrow never comes what a holiday sure out there even in that world the world we're gonna be living in it's gonna be going through time remember they got eleven thousand years day night day night day night right but you're not you're an eternal condition why because of what Christ did it Calvary but then you got to insert in between that that somebody come to a place that said I and my father are one and there's nothing gonna stop me from taking this body and saying Satan brother I'm said what death would what come up your sleeve and what would you do there's fear just like taking a little lint and pushing the lint off of your shoulder off of your off er see your we haven't come to believe that yet no some of you are going I feel so bad I may die tomorrow I'm 80 I'll be 58 in a couple of weeks I'm getting closer I'm getting closer to the door amen but within but with what it's our carnal mind that's why Jesus didn't have a carnal mind he wasn't birthed by a woman listen oh he come through a woman he had to to be a kinsman he had to do that but that woman had nothing to do with his conception nothing he was born from a man you want I'll bring that quote where brother Brian said if you're born of a woman you're dead if you're born of a man you live and that's profound but that's exactly what it is he told Nicodemus he said you must be born from above you must be born from a man because what's the first thing Nicodemus said he said I got to go back and get in my mama's womb he said natural you know what Jesus should have said he should turn around and said that's what killed you to start with are you gonna be double dead by the time you go do that you're gonna be double dead watch why he was saying he said I am the way the truth and the life what the man the male and that's what's happened then these sales we must see Jesus Christ to bring back full fellowship in the manifestation that's what God's waiting on he's waiting on us all right okay so let's look one minute at this list I'm not gonna bring the board out until next two Sundays from them but we see a white horse and we see a rider on that horse and why it is what purity just for a few minutes and then we'll stop that white horse is a symbol of purity right a white righteous whatever you want to call it and he rides true starts riding in the church ages gets on his white horse starts riding and rides through we say the first three Church ages which is correct that is the let me get my line ox man and Eagle so you got your lion your li o and you're lying what you've already got the lion there right the first date the first three ages is the lion age Li Knox man and Eagle first three ages is the lion the Ox is what that fourth age the dark ages the man is Wesley and Luther or Luthor and Wesley and then the Eagle is ours okay everybody got that okay but we'll draw it here but I want to just do this and then we'll just quit cuz we've done enough right now to kind of break the back the foundation back up but I want you to see though that that white horse that white horse was something he got on it was a beast it was a power right and who gave him the power the people a bow oh he could show the bow but he had no arrows they'd be like going hunting grizzly bear without a bullet that's a death wish but you know what you're not gonna Bluff the bear but he bluffed the people cuz he said I got this power right here but remember Satan can only show you so much he's kind of like a magician he shows you what he wants you to see and then he hides all the other stuff back here cuz he had no era to put in there to shoot anybody with but you saw the bow you saw what you saw the doctrine coming up you saw the the deeds of the Nicolaitans you saw the people come up and start going who was that Bob strength yes there right in whose age was that Irina's so you got Paul when Paul left here come Iranians and it was already a man saying Jesus was the like substance of God I mean man that's beginning of writing that what is it he said why Satan straddle that white horse and he took off what in the people telling the people telling the people that he was another substance of God he had a bow which is all these are all symbolic these are actors will read it next Sunday or two Sundays from now and a crown was given who crowned him brother Brown said the people crowned it and then what a crown was given by the people and what did he do through those first three ages look the first three ages was pure there was no denominations in the first three church ages but what was happening though there was a there was a seed planted there was little sayings in the corner kind of like the doctrines we see in the message you know he they try it out on people first a few then when they like it you know and it starts feeling good they go and they bring it to the board people then they bring in some more people like that Satan riding that same horse because brother Brown said that rider gets off that horse and that horse continues into eternity what he said that horse continues to ride that same doctrine that started in the first three ages is still going on today that's why it's got to be cut off the white horse is is beautiful that was a white righteous church here they didn't have a one guard problem they didn't have a water back then the problem they didn't have an eternal hell problem that developed though by during that age Satan got in and he just started weaving his way like a snake weaving his way through the people and just kind of going you know you ever thought about Jesus you know he he had to eat he bled wasn't he just like a human you know what Nia that's all you gotta do hate they say he talks to you he talks to me say why don't you think no I we don't we shouldn't think that's our problem but I'll promise you that white horse road through the church road through the real church he he wrote the wasn't it wasn't that he was in the bar he wasn't in the cat houses well call him back I was going to get out no he's in the church he's in church doing these thing same things now I fly one brother branham coming and showed us he said here stands a lamb and there goes a wild horse rider I was thinking about that this morning there's all things that are that we have in our life that that the word should win when the word comes then you should say Lord is that in me because it hides but is I didn't me yeah that's in you I preached will tell you that yeah that's in you he'll preach a sermon and you'll go man I need to what move over a little bit hey I need to stand here and let that thing go away that's what we're gonna start on these seals we need to know that we need to know for one thing that there is a lamb on the scene and man there's got to be a lamb in your life listen if it's the devil all the way than you know what you're gonna do you're gonna you're the one going in this direction but here stands a lamb with a book in his hand there goes a wireless rider that's why your new birth is the most important thing without the new birth guess what you'll think you're right you'll think you're right Satan thinks he's right and he will make you think you're right that's why that the seals has to tie in with a statue of a perfect man that's not the virtue of a human that's the virtue of God right that's not the knowledge of a human that's the knowledge of God hey man that's what's got to be born in you sure it's great to have knowledge I mean Joe was talking a few minutes ago we've known people with super knowledge come in to message and know all about the Jews and know all about this and all about that but then you start pinpointing their life and where do they go they ride off hello because they can't stand it when you start talking back to life they start riding off and then what they disappeared you don't see them anymore that's what I hate that's bothered me more than anything still bothers me but you know some things you got to get over it's not for everybody bro folks it's not let's stand it is not for everybody but it is for everybody you thought I'm gonna leave somebody out did you it's not for everybody but it is for everybody everybody that won't sit he'll give it and I pray this year that we'll want it more this year than we've ever wanted it before that well that will we'll get a crumb from the monsters table and you know what if you get a crumb and you're hungry a crumbs good but you know what it does it builds strength for you to go get some more and then maybe if you'll show yourself worthy the maestro lets you sit at the table right and he'll let you eat a bunch of bread and a bunch of meat I was talking to a preacher the other day and he was talking about somebody preaching and I told him I was telling my brother Chris I said yeah I like to eat meat I like vegetable but I like to eat me God made me a meat eater he gave me teeth so I could eat me in the gospel and in the natural somebody said a few minutes ago said you like animals I said yeah I love them with vegetable but remember Eagles don't eat turnips come sleep ain't nothing wrong with turnips don't like them but Eagles don't eat turnips they meet cuz they're made for that and that's this age we're made to eat me we thrive off of me oh sure it's it's nice to eat potatoes every once in a while and you know what you won't starve but you won't be completely satisfied either because complete satisfaction is what we're heading to in the headstone because like I said now the pieces are together the head and the body is getting ready to unite this it's never been on earth before sure we were in Christ the bride was in Christ but we could not work he couldn't work he only worked whatever he could write he didn't work the way he wanted to that's why sometimes he gets us ready said do you now believe he'd say and he did one time he said lord of mercy what's wrong with you people right he told me so what's wrong with you do you now believe but you know what he knew that he had to go to Calvary to get us out we were there but we could not work like we were supposed to work but once he came back on the day of Pentecost he said I am pleased to dwell in these church ages but right there to end I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna unite with what I started with all that we built up I'm gonna sit down and we're gonna get out of here that's the only way we're gonna get out of here hey man let's sing a song number eight inspire bullet list sing to the Lord turning through the land singing as I go pointing slows to count through your bombers wins Oh come on it's a on the streets of me let me live muffled there's all past home at last ever to rejoice when in service for my lord dark may be the night but I was late more close to here you give me like Saint snared me makes my soul turn my daughter's life but my Lord goes ahead every time though I want to see and look upon his face there to sing forever saving grace my board cares all planets all my life never to rejoice waiting Bally's Lord Lord for the bounty high and behold my Savior there with a dinner hand up straight for the by lilo he's guiding me I can see the word go oh I want to see him look upon his face they're saying Morris the saving rate on the streets of glory my boys cares all packs on my last day we rejoice when before me billows rise from the mighty then the borderless my bar eNOS a flick here and he leaves me dilly under this world below he's a real friend to me love is oh oh to see if look upon his face there to say forever of its saving grace on the streets of glory ever Terry George you know we've looked through seven Church ages we've had two were to God and we've looked a man we've looked we've looked right at him in the word and we build an image in our mind of what he might look like because even brother Branham said that's the closest but remember Adam knows exactly what he looks like right Adam saw him face to face now we know all the other ones did which was after Adam but when Adam in God there was no fear just like me in Louie's talking together he said hey Dad how you doing I mean they were they were right here see that's the first Adam but he lost that and sure we saw Jesus they saw Jesus in a flesh body but he got older then then there was a miracle happened when he resurrected then Marian the ones finally saw him maybe the way they were supposed to see because remember Mary said what have you done with Jesus right they know what she said what are you done with him and then when he said Mary she knew but still stay looking I want to Peter went fishing they all did different things I was like what really they didn't believe the way they should have believed a man because you know what there wasn't a Holy Ghost anchor in their soul but now on the day of Pentecost Peter James John they all looked back and said we missed it I know they did I know they just I know that's why they cried I would have cried for a month we missed it he was standing remember what was it when I'm John Owen said we held we held the God of glory we hugged his neck and we missed him listen can it feel happen can it still happen that we miss it but all they somebody gonna see it there's somebody gonna see it but listen we're not gonna say it like we say it in the Millennium we're gonna be standing there face to face with a God created you with a God that brought you out and created what you stand in him and he's gonna look at you say well done my good and faithful servant I couldn't be right there with you but I was in you and you get a work I let's preach now so there no I want to see him but we got to see him in a word first we got to see him in each other and then we're gonna see him face to face think about Adam though what a privilege I mean all that stuff was new brother that God had created the world the stars were brand new earth was brand new even though it's been billions of years old what does it matter it was brand new to Adam cuz when he started walking on the earth and then this guy walks up and said I'm your Creator and he goes you must because we look just a lot then he said I'm lonely I'm lonely he's still saying today I'm lonely I'm lonely I wonder what I want to embrace something hey embrace this word first and it'll take you right to that let's borrow a family father we pray that you'd be with us today take care of us on the highways as we go home may this word Lord as the prophet said there
