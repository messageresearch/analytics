========================================

Matthew 11 verse 12 now what I know the last the last last few times that I I taught Sunday school we um we got into kind of the third pool and and the we talked about the the three measures of meal just the the the word of God filling you up until you uh are just so full of him that well we can take we can take a a body change that it changes our whole being that the the things of our of uh of this world is die off and we're purged until we come uh to be more and more like him not a a like a rigid statue but something living in In His Image and um you know uh I I got to thinking about how when when God reveals something to you and he it's almost like he takes you up into the into the heavens and then brings it back down in a in a real simple way so we kind of got into uh you I I I don't it's almost when people say it's so deep things are deep that I struggle with that sometimes because when God reveals it to you when he brings it down to where you can understand it then it's not deep anymore it's something that you can comprehend and you can get excited about it because you begin to realize what God is showing you what God is doing and and I got to thinking about how God has that's how he has always worked in the Old Testament he took Moses up into a high mountain and he showed him he he Moses said let's build we're going to build the Tabernacle build build everything the way that I saw it in the mountain so God showed Moses uh something he took him high up and showed him a s showed him the plan the Plan of Redemption in the Tabernacle the plan of how it should be in the wilderness all those things and then Moses brought it down he came down and showed it to the people in a way that they could understand even though they didn't understand in the fullness like you know they didn't understand all the types and shadows but he brought he he brought down the Revelation from the mountain and you think about Jacob when he fell asleep and he had a dream about that ladder that descended from Out of Heaven from that the Throne of God and that brother R talked about and explained that the Angels were going up and coming down they go up and come down and brother brandom when he was out out west the angels caught him up and took him up and he caught the Mysteries and came back and brought it brought it to us in a way that it was so simple that's I believe that it it's was so simple it what the real true Revelation that that you know it just went so far over all of our heads and I know there's a there's a time and a play there's a time and a season for us to catch it and and it just wasn't the time then that for everyone to catch the Revelation but now as the Mysteries are being unfolded I I believe that it's it it's so simple that's what brother BR priest in Christ revealed in Simplicity that God can reveal himself in a way that he can come down so simple that it's almost beyond our understanding it's beyond our reasoning we if we try to reason it out in our own mind it just goes it will go too high but it's so simple the way that God expresses it the way that God reveals himself and so maybe uh uh I want to come back a little bit with some real simple scriptures that kind of I think illustrates the truth of what um what was in the three majors of of meal and and the different things that we've been talking about that you know how that Joshua brought the children of Israel into the promised land and and they're they're fighting like we're fighting our way up the stature of perfect man uh not that they fought the Battle it was really God but they had to hold the sword in their hand and go forth and and and you know against the all the religions of their day to quote all the the things that came against them all the all the carnal ideas and and just like we do in our flesh we're fighting against the Waring against uh our flesh and and uh our own ideas and and different things so I I want to start off at Matthew 11: 12 we'll we'll start reading and before we read the scripture let's just go to the Lord in prayer and make sure I turn my thing on my did Lord Jesus we thank you God for another day to serve you Lord and another day to be among your people Lord and to Fellowship in your presence Lord and I pray God lord there's no way that we can understand the word unless you come and reveal it and open it Lord I pray that you'll just come down this morning Lord Jesus and open it to us Lord and be with us this morning in the services Lord that you will heal the sick and Afflicted and the Brokenhearted and be with us and Deliver us from evil Lord we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Matthew 11:12 this is where you know John joh uh his his Eagle Eye had got damned as brother BR explained it and he was he sent out Messengers from prison to see if what Jesus was preaching was if he really was the Messiah the one that they had been looking for if if you know when John was the one that had saw the spirit of God come down on Jesus and identify him and remain and stayed on him and he knew he it was his testimony his confession that this is the one that we're looking at but then is he was all in prison behind the bars and his Eagle Eye kind of got dimmed over he was you know he he began maybe to look at circumstance and so of sent Messengers to see is this really the one that we've been looking for oh yeah and and Jesus said let let me start back um at verse 11 verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there ha not risen a greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he that is least in the king Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he now there's the scripture that we use that that you know that I I will you be surprised today how many believe that in the Old Testament they had the Holy Ghost uh which you know this scripture um plainly speaks against because if you are in the Kingdom of Heaven that you have been baptized and seal he is the person of Jesus Christ is living inside of you and you can see the kingdom and you're part of it then you are the least in that kingdom is greater than John because John had not come that the the atonement the price had not been paid and you see God will not dwell in an unclean vessel and we had to be cleansed by the blood of the Lamb so that we could be clean in Old Testament that cleansing and that that payment had not been made which is why in the Old Testament they could not receive the Holy Ghost you that that price had to be paid first and uh so and from the days of John the Baptist till now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force and I I've been meditating on this all week and this this scripture has been just a huge blessing because of what it represents yeah how uh how we're supposed to conduct our lives and how we're supposed to approach approach him and so Jesus what's he he's telling everybody this is the one that you don't understand John's purpose his purpose uh and if I could par phrase a little bit his purpose was to get everybody in a frame of mind that they could accept the Messiah when he came right so as soon as John came on the scene then they their hearts the hearts of the people began to be quickened they began to become violently enthused to follow after Christ they can to what uh get in their mind whatever it takes for us to find this whatever this man is speaking about then that is what I'm willing to do and now you can go back through all of scripture and find out that this is how this is the approach that Paul talked about in Hebrews 11 this is the approach that that all down through scripture everyone that comes to God takes is because they are violently enthus violent is a strange word to use but it's a word that symbolizes you know someone attacking a SE somebody you know coming after something that maybe otherwise they would not be allowed to get and now that's the way that a sinner comes a sinner has no right without without God what right do we have to any of the claims WR in scripture there's no there's no claim that we have to anything that's written down if it wasn't for Christ but when John began to preach his gospel and the people began to catch it that there was something in the works then I believe something called in them and they began to to cry out just the same way as when brother Brandon began to preach when he came on the scene then the people you know they would sit in his meeting get there way early in the morning get show up and and put uh their coats on the seats and and uh Reserve their seats and and just uh almost get into fights over who who could be there and it's Africans and Africa sitting in the rain waiting uh even in Jesus day sitting sitting out there remember when he fed the the 5,000 and so forth the different numbers they were hungry but they were sitting there hungry for the word they didn't care about their body they were sitting there Desiring to hear the word of God because something in them has risen up to be violently violently enthused to follow after God now now you might think well that's that's an interesting interpretation is it an interpretation there's no private interpretation but there is private Revelation and that's what I I'm talking about this morning what I'm going to get to is private Revelation but let's go over to Luke 16 16 let's see how Luke wrote that in Luke 16:16 Jesus said the law and the prophets were until John since that time since John the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it now he's kind of rewarding what Matthew wrote down that they violently were were seeking after the things of God now the kingdom of God was preached but the the baptism of the Holy Ghost was not yet given and but so they they were pressing forward with the little bit of of understanding that they had all that they knew you know they they uh were just getting a little just had just enough to just keep pressing on but now that's the way of a a real Christian is you keep moving on as much as God will give you hang on to that and let it grow according to whatever the spirit will give you and just keep moving on and you know how I I I I keep saying that the the tortoise is the one that won the race slow and steady wins the race but now I believe that a Christian tortois violently tries to move a Christian tortoise does not sit on their recliner and and and you know just put on stuff on TV or or whatever just kind of set by the wayside well I'm going to church and brother Dale's got the Revelation so that's good enough for me but a real Christian a real Christian tortoise tries to get what presses forward to get whatever he can to to see God's righteousness fulfilled in his life pressing forward towards the mark of the high calling as Paul said now so let's let's kind of think about some examples in scripture of the men of God that pressed forward and then we'll look at what we pressed for and and what it looks what pressing forward in this day looks like so we already talked about the one sitting in the field Waiting on Jesus to preach where they they disregarded everything of their the natural of the flesh they they stopped looking at how hungry they were how tired they were it didn't matter it didn't matter it it it didn't matter you know if somebody would come and say uh horrible things about them and and and you know follow the disciples along as they begin to be whipped and and bruised and and bodying and and by people saying things those things didn't matter it doesn't matter if somebody hurts your feelings it doesn't matter who cares I'm pressing forward to the mark the high calling and one of the greatest stories of somebody who violently pressed forward now this is the the the stalk example of violently pressing forward because there was actual violence involved in this story is when Jacob was camped out going to meet his brother he was all afraid and he sent all of his family he sent everybody ahead of him and he camped out that night before going on and following him to meet his brother Esau right right and now this is is what I'm leading up to is Jacob was all alone and that's what I'm leading up to now when you think about the third poll and everything think about how God is coming to you to reveal his word to you it is all alone you it's you and God Alone there's nobody else you go to church and you fellowship with other ones but you know when it it it all comes down to your personal relationship with God just you and God because one day your pastor and the deacons and the associate pastor and everybody's going to have to give account for what they believe but you're going to stand there all alone because in second Corinthians Paul said we must all stand in the judgment to give account for the Deeds Done in the body you know you you you at one point you will all have to stand alone and now we all stand alone before God as we come before him we come to him in a secret place just like Jacob before he met Esau now he was all scared he didn't have an army to depend upon he didn't have anything to depend upon and that night he wrestled with the angel violence he got he got violent now this is a holy violence a holy violence that carries on into the New Testament where we've got to become the way that we approach God has to become so in so much fervor I I wonder maybe sometimes is this why we don't get the things that we need is this why um there's a lot more I can say on that but right amen you know just fill in the blanks is this why are we in are we violently seeking the things of God thank you like Jacob and and Jacob wrestled with the angel all night and he said I will not let you go until you give me my blessing and now that he's wrestling with God does God want us to wrestle with him I I think he does okay I think he wants us to to get down and say lord it's written in your word what your promise is and I believe that you will give it to me because you promised it now I I I got to think about all the promises of healing in the Bible and how that is one is such a stumbling block to people that healing is comes by faith and we don't we don't want to believe that but uh it this really is one of the it's such a controversial belief that if you can believe God for healing that he will he will heal you and uh it's so controversial that many you know denominational ministers won't preach it cuz they you know they want to preach that well sometimes God just don't want sometimes uh you know uh cuz we want to have an excuse we want to have an excuse for our unbelief but here's the thing of it if God promised in his word that all things are possible to them that believe that's right that if anything anything you can move a mountain if you believe it you you're stopwatch or your pocket watch or whatever will show up on your dresser or in your pocket if you can believe it that's an astounding thing but here's the thing of it is God said it I didn't say it he said it so he's obligated to back up his word if we'll believe it and if we come to him violently like that violently trusting storming the Gates of Heaven to see his promises made manifest in our life then I believe that he'll ansers if we come to him and and and I was reading through how brother Bram said you know you preach based on your experience and I am speaking from my experience this morning that when you come to God and you don't give up then he will answer your prayer I I believe that because my experience Bears record of that and I'mma I'm going to jump ahead a little bit let's go over to an example of that about in the Bible let's go over to Luke 11 chapter Luke 11 verse five can you aggravate God Luke Chapter 5 and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend leave me three loaves for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and I have nothing to say before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee go away it's not a good time it's it's not a good it it doesn't fit in into the didn't a plan or whatever I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he need need it what is importunity that means he's aggravating he keeps banging on the door he won't go away he won't stop and that's what that's how we should approach God for the things we have need of my my you know you say my my kids aren't serving the lord are you aggravating God are you banging on the doors of Heaven are you on your knees constantly because you know brother B said we think a real man is somebody that got has big muscles or he can talk to his wife you know you shouldn't be you got to listen to me but a real man has big old bags under his eyes and bags under his knees because he's been on his knees praying that's right amen he's worn knees out and the same thing about a woman a real woman is somebody that's been banging on the doors of Heaven now now we we we like to make excuses for our unbelief and say well my kids are not serving the lord because uh you know this and that you know you can God can I believe that God can compensate for our mistakes and I've seen this happen before so many times where I I'll say something stupid at work and just just uh you know I'm afraid that my boss thinks I'm a just an idiot and I'll go before the Lord God I believe that you can change his mind you can make him think differently about the situation I go into work the next day and I'm the best thing ever at work now God can can compensate for our stupidity but if you go before the Lord in prayer he will he I believe with all my heart that he will make it right he if if you bang on the doors of Heaven if you seek him with everything that youve got and this is how we approach God this is a a the way of a Christian tortoise is to violently seek after God and and now think about how they they listen they listened to Paul preach all night until they were the the brother fell asleep out of the uh out of the third thank you the third the third day uh brother brandom out in the woods praying while mosquitoes are biting him he didn't he didn't he stopped thinking about the mosquitoes biting him because he was violently seeking after God the mosquitoes didn't care and that's how the things of this world are you know all these people that are talking about different all the world you know that I don't know if you heard about that the certain Minister that I wanton won call his name but been on the news lately because he was preaching the truth those little mosquito who cares about what the things of the world the world are saying right and uh and I was thinking about Believers testimonies that I've heard about that Believers praying that God would show them the truth that they would not be deceived storm in the windows of heaven so that God would show them I somebody was telling me about how they came to the message that they were up all night praying God showed me the truth I know it's it's out there somewhere and somebody laid a message book in their hand and because they were seeking something right and and just the idea the way of Christian tortois is whatever it takes whatever it costs remember the story of the man that came to brother brand seeking the holy or it wasn't brother brand was I believe it was somebody else seeking the Holy Ghost and they said well let's go down to the into the the mud mud puddle the hog pin and and get in there and if you're not willing to do whatever it takes then you don't have the right idea and I the the spirit of this age lead AA is that we just get relaxed that that we're not willing to do whatever we're not willing to pray all night anymore brother R scolded us for not even be willing to pray an hour an hour seems like so long when we get down to pray but that's not uh in in brother brandom's time the the way that he thought of T get before the Lord that was not even you just barely getting started because are we willing to do whatever it takes whatever it takes to save the Lost whatever it takes to see our family save whatever it takes to see our church grow in Grace and and get stronger whatever it takes what do you have to drive somewhere to talk to somebody that uh is is struggling with the Lord or or just pick up the phone and dial her number and call them whatever it takes now if I can interrupt you know what I've allowed to be a stumbling block for me is you're not supposed to be repetitious so yes yeah I get a little confused I'm I appreciate what you're saying today but I allow that to be a stumbling block that you're not supposed to be repetitious When you pray say it and stand on it yeah right well what what I think when I pray uh is I I don't I know that brother said don't be repetitious but I I sometimes I am a little bit repetitious getting started and you know I think that's fine because once things get moving then I you know they they say uh that you kind of break through when you pray that you kind of start off when you kind of start off is kind of you're you're you're telling God what you believe and asking things asking for him to to uh give you things but then after a little bit it it's almost like it's not you anymore speaking that he begins to speak through you and so I um that's what I believe that you know just if it once you got once your knees are on the ground then you've already made a huge step because this day of time it's so hard even to put your knees on the ground it's so hard to set time aside it's so hard to uh and I know the Bible says pray unceasing pray all the time just wherever you wherever you're walking around you just speak to him and but I I I do think that that there comes a time when we need to set aside time maybe you're not calling out to God with all of your heart but you're setting aside quiet time so that he can speak to you and maybe a lot of times what I like to do is is I just I just get in a quiet time and and open the Bible and begin to read and before long something you know you just you reading in Isaiah or Psalm 91 and something Sparks and I believe this and then when you you begin to pray you can tell God what you believe and I believe he likes that when you tell him that I believe your word and and I know what this is talking about because you revealed it to me and that uh that just opens up the gates where you can you can begin to speak to him in confidence knowing that he hears and and will answer your prayer and and it's such a great comfort when you know you can you can get down on your knees and and and pray and and and just kind of talk but when he comes on the scene yes and vindicates that he has heard your prayer then you can get up and walk in faith and that's that's what that's getting into the third pool and and uh I uh let's uh we just got a few minutes let just we'll just end on this we'll we'll read I I'll read it to you you don't even have to turn in Matthew 6 now this is what I was going to Matthew 6 1-6 take take he that you do knock your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before the as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest arms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth that thine arms may be in secret and th Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seing of men and verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet alone just you and God and when thou H has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in the secret shall reward thee openly and when you pray pray violently when you do anything for God do it violently do everything that you do do it with all that you got and we'll stop right there rocking out tears and I
