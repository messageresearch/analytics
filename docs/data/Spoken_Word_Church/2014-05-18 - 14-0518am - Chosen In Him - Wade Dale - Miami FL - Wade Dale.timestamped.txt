[1:08:12] Ephesians I didn't bring my electr
[1:08:20] device never runs out of
[1:08:22] battery
[1:08:33] the old fashioned
[1:08:38] way I'm on hear
[1:08:44] meway you know the we were talking
[1:08:48] back the great mystery that we've been
[1:08:52] talking you know
[1:08:57] shamefully we had our conversation
[1:08:59] sometimes in times
[1:09:01] past of the
[1:09:03] world how that this hand that you
[1:09:08] see that now holds the
[1:09:11] Bible used to hold something that wasn't
[1:09:14] good beer
[1:09:21] cigarettes and when I was when I was in
[1:09:24] the
[1:09:25] world I us I used to say things with
[1:09:28] this that was not
[1:09:30] good amen
[1:09:33] amen but God didn't have to
[1:09:37] rebuild this outside
[1:09:40] part still this is the same hand this is
[1:09:44] the same mouth but the mystery
[1:09:48] is Satan's
[1:09:51] gone God
[1:09:55] so now this hand that used to ra a
[1:10:00] beer now
[1:10:03] raises the same mouth that
[1:10:07] destroy hopefully now is able to
[1:10:10] help there's
[1:10:12] thean looks at
[1:10:14] you the same
[1:10:17] guy no it's
[1:10:21] not cuz it's changed on the inside
[1:10:25] that inside
[1:10:27] work brings the outside
[1:10:30] man into
[1:10:34] subjection am amen so let's read in the
[1:10:37] book of
[1:10:39] Ephesians we're still on the Masterpiece
[1:10:42] family but we're going to speak on
[1:10:44] chosen in him

[1:11:26] will of
[1:11:30] God to the Saints which are in

[1:12:54] all all spiritual
[1:13:01] blessing now where is

[1:14:04] according as he had
[1:14:07] chosen Us in
[1:14:11] him am
[1:14:13] before the foundation of the world show
[1:14:16] you that
[1:14:18] we look how personal that is that we

[1:14:25] Blame before him in
[1:14:27] love let's bow our head dear heavenly
[1:14:30] father we

[1:14:38] we ask you to bless the
[1:14:39] people bless the speaker Lord you the
[1:14:43] one
[1:14:44] that you be the one
[1:14:48] that Lord just be with us if there be
[1:14:51] any sick among us here

[1:14:59] destru father a
[1:15:01] word may you
[1:15:03] heal may you save may you
[1:15:07] San we ask
[1:15:22] these
[1:15:25] amen so we look at this
[1:15:29] okay amen Sunday
[1:15:34] morning everybody's dressed all
[1:15:37] pretty let's listen for a little
[1:15:40] while let's see what God can
[1:15:43] say last night we ended
[1:15:47] up by that
[1:15:50] image being able to speak now
[1:15:54] listen we can't just
[1:15:57] speak
[1:16:00] presumptuously because brother brand
[1:16:02] said if we are
[1:16:04] presuming that means we're venturing
[1:16:06] without
[1:16:09] Authority so the
[1:16:11] authority we can't just speak when we
[1:16:14] want
[1:16:16] to now there's an example of let's turn
[1:16:19] to the book of
[1:16:22] act keep your Bibles
[1:16:24] we're read
[1:16:27] SC book of
[1:16:32] Acts because remember if you speak you
[1:16:36] got to know how to speak and you got to
[1:16:39] have the
[1:16:41] authority CU if you don't watch what
[1:16:45] happen verse
[1:16:48] 11 and God wrought special Miracles by
[1:16:51] the hands of
[1:16:52] Paul
[1:16:55] Paul's full of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:57] right's full of the Holy
[1:16:59] Ghost he has the
[1:17:01] authority so that from his body were
[1:17:07] brought an are
[1:17:10] a and the diseases departed from
[1:17:13] them and the evil spirits went
[1:17:16] out now if you'll notice how much y
[1:17:19] believe that
[1:17:21] scripture in Acts
[1:17:24] you see what I got in
[1:17:26] my I have prayer
[1:17:29] CL that we preach
[1:17:34] over cut them up cuz I don't believe
[1:17:37] that was just for
[1:17:46] Paul
[1:17:48] my I've seen
[1:17:51] cancer just because of man
[1:17:57] AC that's not just for PA if you have
[1:18:01] the Holy
[1:18:04] Ghost so I keep it right here
[1:18:11] blessing but let's
[1:18:13] continue now there were people that were
[1:18:17] watching this that were watching Paul it
[1:18:21] would watch them take a
[1:18:23] cloth give it to someone and an evil
[1:18:26] spirit
[1:18:28] Le but now here comes the group of
[1:18:32] without the Holy
[1:18:33] Ghost then certain of the Vagabond
[1:18:38] Jews
[1:18:41] Exorcist witches whatever took upon them
[1:18:45] to call over them which had evil
[1:18:51] spirit look they call
[1:18:53] in the name of the Lord
[1:18:56] Jesus saying we adure You by
[1:19:02] Jesus
[1:19:06] prach that's
[1:19:11] not I'm not going to adure somebody by
[1:19:14] the
[1:19:20] paach god you PR
[1:19:24] and there were seven
[1:19:26] sons one a
[1:19:29] Jew hey this guy was chief of the
[1:19:32] priest he should have known
[1:19:36] better which did
[1:19:40] so and the evil
[1:19:42] spirit answered and said Jesus I
[1:19:47] know
[1:19:51] know
[1:19:56] so if we
[1:20:01] speak the devil's just going to stay
[1:20:04] there he doesn't care what
[1:20:09] you but Paul had experience these people
[1:20:14] had never had experience
[1:20:17] amen hallelujah and the men in whom the
[1:20:21] evil spirit
[1:20:25] left on
[1:20:27] them and overcame
[1:20:30] them and prevailed against them so that
[1:20:34] they fled out of that house
[1:20:38] and they left in worse shape than they
[1:20:42] can that's venturing without
[1:20:46] Authority am so if we're going to speak
[1:20:49] with
[1:20:50] authority we must not
[1:20:53] have a second hand
[1:20:56] Revelation
[1:20:58] am it's all right that William had a
[1:21:05] revelation but I can't ad evil
[1:21:20] spirit so we got know how to
[1:21:24] speak and have
[1:21:27] Authority or you're going to be in the
[1:21:32] shape there's a
[1:21:35] example amen
[1:21:37] am so now as we go I
[1:21:41] want now as we come to a
[1:21:44] place that we're going to look at this
[1:21:49] scripture we're still going to go back
[1:21:51] to Romans 8 but
[1:21:54] almost be able
[1:22:00] to amen
[1:22:02] amen but in Romans
[1:22:06] 8 he did
[1:22:08] predestinate so see the ones that God
[1:22:12] for they have
[1:22:15] authority because
[1:22:21] God you just got to find
[1:22:24] out what you're doing here and where you
[1:22:30] going Adam had complete
[1:22:34] Authority man he had he had authority
[1:22:37] over
[1:22:38] everything we speak
[1:22:42] president here on the
[1:22:46] earth n n no what Adam said I sign up
[1:22:51] again he ruin the whole world
[1:22:56] what are we going back
[1:23:02] to what are we going back
[1:23:05] to and that doesn't make us have a big
[1:23:09] head I hope you don't leave
[1:23:13] here but I hope you leave here
[1:23:21] with because
[1:23:25] Revelation makes you
[1:23:29] humble it humbl
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:34] things and
[1:23:36] he trust
[1:23:40] Youth and that you can
[1:23:43] speak because when when
[1:23:48] Michelangelo the very thing that
[1:23:51] been
[1:23:55] same way with
[1:23:56] God God had
[1:23:59] those he had those
[1:24:02] attributes he had your
[1:24:05] inheritance but the picture wasn't
[1:24:09] developed sure it was
[1:24:11] real to
[1:24:13] him he wanted to see
[1:24:17] you he had
[1:24:21] Joy
[1:24:25] he was proud his
[1:24:28] children he could
[1:24:30] see made
[1:24:32] manifest another
[1:24:35] form that's right so sin didn't bother
[1:24:39] God he still had
[1:24:42] picture he just had to hang on to it for
[1:24:44] a
[1:24:45] little like last night he
[1:24:48] develop that
[1:24:50] picture because this is the
[1:24:54] you got to have a
[1:24:56] POS you got to have something
[1:24:59] to before you can have a
[1:25:02] negative now for those of you young
[1:25:04] children don't know what a
[1:25:06] negative we have
[1:25:11] this used to we' have a
[1:25:15] ro some of your old on
[1:25:19] going you have to take it somewhere
[1:25:23] and they would
[1:25:24] develop you don't have to do that now
[1:25:27] cuz you got little SD
[1:25:29] card those things you know but it
[1:25:32] doesn't do away with what God
[1:25:34] has God had a picture
[1:25:37] in and he was going to see it
[1:25:41] manifest which was you and I so those
[1:25:44] Eternal thoughts were
[1:25:47] expressed now
[1:25:50] remember John 1
[1:25:53] in the
[1:25:54] beginning was the
[1:25:56] word so the word was
[1:25:58] there amen the word was there sure man
[1:26:03] just wrote this thousand years
[1:26:08] ago but this was before the
[1:26:11] found
[1:26:13] am it just had to
[1:26:15] develop through
[1:26:18] Isaiah all the prophets down to Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ
[1:26:23] but in John
[1:26:24] 1 in the
[1:26:28] beginning in the beginning was the
[1:26:31] word the word was with
[1:26:34] God and
[1:26:37] word verse 14 that word was made fles we
[1:26:43] can
[1:26:45] see same way with you and
[1:26:48] I in the
[1:26:50] beginning the
[1:26:55] genis and it was a
[1:27:00] word not individuals remember that we
[1:27:04] weren't
[1:27:05] individual we weren't running
[1:27:09] around see that's where the Mormons get
[1:27:12] that Mormons say we were all up
[1:27:15] there then we came down
[1:27:19] here brother said that's not true you
[1:27:22] were nothing only in the
[1:27:26] mind just like when I was 16 years
[1:27:30] old I was a potential
[1:27:33] father I had the ability to be a
[1:27:36] father amen and my children were in me
[1:27:41] but you couldn't find
[1:27:42] them but they were in my
[1:27:45] thoughts but through holy
[1:27:48] wedlock they develop well that was the
[1:27:51] natural way
[1:27:53] God works the same way he works through
[1:27:56] the spoken
[1:27:57] work amen am but he
[1:28:00] still listen Adam
[1:28:05] needed to finish the
[1:28:09] program Adam not
[1:28:13] reproduce he
[1:28:15] needed God
[1:28:19] cannot without
[1:28:30] got all right listen we're going to
[1:28:36] down
[1:28:47] calm
[1:28:50] look talk about this
[1:28:52] talk
[1:28:54] about but let's stay on our
[1:28:56] subject so the word became
[1:29:00] flesh right Jesus Christ the word
[1:29:04] word he was real he was the one
[1:29:09] stand okay so he was there we weren't
[1:29:13] but we were part of
[1:29:15] it in an attribute form amen everybody
[1:29:19] okay with
[1:29:20] that so how we come
[1:29:23] here remember the word became
[1:29:27] flesh he was the word
[1:29:31] before
[1:29:37] and so he had to come the right
[1:29:40] way bring us here and then now the flesh
[1:29:46] is becoming word amen the word became
[1:29:50] FL
[1:29:52] but through him I told you last Jesus
[1:29:56] didn't bring
[1:29:57] you well that shocked you a little
[1:30:02] bit he came
[1:30:10] and he didn't bring it you already had
[1:30:14] he just brought you the way
[1:30:16] back to the tree of
[1:30:18] life because if you get on the tree of
[1:30:20] life
[1:30:23] that's
[1:30:25] life Jesus it's eternal
[1:30:28] life amen amen you love the
[1:30:32] Lord so the word became flesh so that
[1:30:36] the flesh could become
[1:30:39] word CU we're going to have a word
[1:30:42] body amen the body Mom and Daddy
[1:30:48] brought
[1:30:50] old amen amen all you got to do is look
[1:30:55] around you look next
[1:30:58] year you going have more
[1:31:01] hair
[1:31:11] unless still
[1:31:20] get I don't know where that came
[1:31:27] from John
[1:31:29] 1 the word became
[1:31:34] flesh so that now in our
[1:31:38] flesh the word can be back in
[1:31:44] power just like in Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ this evening we're going to get
[1:31:50] in we've got to
[1:31:54] realize that Jesus whatever he
[1:31:58] is whatever
[1:32:02] characteristic we
[1:32:05] must to get out of
[1:32:09] here now
[1:32:11] remember Abraham Abraham took a
[1:32:15] temporary body
[1:32:17] change he died he was changed by
[1:32:25] amen amen Jesus Christ when he died he
[1:32:30] came by with the
[1:32:31] glorify that's never going to
[1:32:34] die so if we can
[1:32:36] see that we're not just chosen in

[1:40:35] etern listen people notri
[1:40:43] aible but if you ever find
[1:40:46] yourself you find you're already
[1:40:49] ready
[1:40:51] already you
[1:40:55] don't you got to make this
[1:41:02] one hallu
[1:41:06] Hallelujah Lord Brother ROM said when
[1:41:09] you became born again that you heard
[1:41:12] from your
[1:41:16] the we read the
[1:41:19] quot that was a
[1:41:22] the and there's only
[1:41:24] one Jesus Christ held that
[1:41:28] the
[1:41:30] only and that's the soul of God that's
[1:41:33] why
[1:41:35] we we you'll give his
[1:41:39] soul my father about 10 years ago
[1:41:44] preached in a church on the soul of
[1:41:47] God and the preer there had a problem
[1:41:55] a message
[1:41:58] PR but when he got to read the word he
[1:42:02] got to read the
[1:42:04] quot he saw that God was a
[1:42:07] s the only
[1:42:10] Eternal that's where you and I came
[1:42:13] from only
[1:42:15] one now look these brothers are
[1:42:19] from born
[1:42:21] there I was born in
[1:42:24] America but I received a new birth about
[1:42:26] 15 years
[1:42:28] ago say they receive new
[1:42:32] birth now is there a new birth different
[1:42:34] than
[1:42:47] mine you got the
[1:42:49] same
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:57] same's only one Soul there's only one
[1:43:01] theop and if you're born again today you
[1:43:05] got the same
[1:43:08] Soul if you have
[1:43:16] birth but if you do we're all
[1:43:19] one where we really
[1:43:22] are because
[1:43:25] listen my wife and I have been married
[1:43:27] for 35 years my my
[1:43:29] my6 coming up now we're
[1:43:32] one and in God we're one now we're
[1:43:38] phally she has a DNA makeup of her
[1:43:45] family all right so we can't use that as
[1:43:48] an
[1:43:49] examp let's go back
[1:43:55] the
[1:44:17] youle
[1:44:19] sheer
[1:44:25] her name
[1:44:31] wasis their
[1:44:45] name that's true Oneness I said there we
[1:44:50] physically
[1:44:52] can't after the
[1:44:54] fall but by the new
[1:45:05] birth
[1:45:07] different but we're supposed to
[1:45:12] all so that makes us part of the
[1:45:15] family you can't take a sample of this
[1:45:19] BL
[1:45:21] in natural
[1:45:24] terms but if she could take her eternal
[1:45:28] life it
[1:45:30] test you do every
[1:45:33] service
[1:45:46] word
[1:45:47] t and he says oh that's my
[1:45:51] child but she's got the
[1:45:54] same she's got the
[1:45:57] same you see how
[1:46:00] close obviously see how far away thought
[1:46:04] all this that
[1:46:05] God that we were waiting on
[1:46:08] something if you're born again you are
[1:46:11] already
[1:46:17] God and when he sees us
[1:46:19] all he's going to
[1:46:24] say theet
[1:46:27] God was God ad and Eve in the Garden of
[1:46:31] Eden having Fellowship now to me and you
[1:46:36] that's if we look through
[1:46:49] natural and Redemption is not
[1:46:53] replacable you can't drop
[1:46:56] this pick up this if you
[1:47:03] drop
[1:47:09] Redemption and then God Pi it
[1:47:15] back that's where we got to
[1:47:18] go see so really
[1:47:21] it's wrong for us to I mean for
[1:47:22] illustration
[1:47:23] purposes we can point and say we're
[1:47:25] going
[1:47:27] back that's coming
[1:47:33] here brother preach hiding
[1:47:38] himself
[1:47:40] simp he preach
[1:47:43] great Jesus Christ
[1:47:46] u the seven seal he preached God in simp
[1:47:58] but our
[1:48:00] problem we have a
[1:48:10] mind the only reason I can't go through
[1:48:16] that I go to reasoning that I'm a
[1:48:28] I mean it's kind of silly but
[1:48:30] that's start reasoning out you know God
[1:48:35] or Jesus when he came back glorified
[1:48:38] body when he was getting ready to enter
[1:48:41] that he didn't walk up to that
[1:48:44] wall maybe I can
[1:48:47] maybe there wasn't a thought in his
[1:48:56] that's
[1:49:03] problem we
[1:49:05] are
[1:49:07] it that was Jesus glori body and it
[1:49:13] was thanes prom put his hand in
[1:49:17] his touching something
[1:49:21] th put
[1:49:26] his know let me
[1:49:31] something how this God is how this
[1:49:36] father so
[1:49:38] great didn't need us
[1:49:43] Tov do you think God needs
[1:49:48] you God don't need you but he wants
[1:49:53] you am am amen but you know
[1:49:58] what that Eternal
[1:50:01] Father that Eternal
[1:50:04] God never had a
[1:50:06] beginning will never have an
[1:50:09] end he came here on
[1:50:12] Earth and
[1:50:14] Manar his
[1:50:19] body man's beat
[1:50:21] his they drove Nails his hands
[1:50:25] feet they chopped his side
[1:50:29] openet God said he look like
[1:50:37] Hamburg a whole face full
[1:50:40] of and they spit on
[1:50:44] this but when he came
[1:50:47] back in a glorified body
[1:50:51] he still had
[1:50:57] SCH that
[1:50:59] God to get you into a perfect
[1:51:03] body gave his body
[1:51:06] up for
[1:51:09] eternity will have those
[1:51:13] nail but you
[1:51:16] won't you will live in a perfect body
[1:51:20] oh if
[1:51:26] man man to
[1:51:32] put not going to be there you're going
[1:51:35] to be
[1:51:36] perfect what a great dadd
[1:51:39] we he
[1:51:45] us be
[1:51:48] perfect for eternity
[1:51:51] he took your
[1:51:53] Scar the on you
[1:51:55] should he took your
[1:51:59] stri he took the nail prints the on
[1:52:02] you he should have nailed me and
[1:52:08] you
[1:52:10] et when we see
[1:52:13] those one thing for sure our father came
[1:52:17] and rescued us a p
[1:52:21] gave us a
[1:52:22] glorified that will
[1:52:25] never be
[1:52:39] imperfect the worlds God s
[1:52:43] son I wouldn't send my son to
[1:52:46] die I go
[1:52:48] myself I go myself in the form of a
[1:52:54] son
[1:52:59] for amen
[1:53:02] amen so you heard from
[1:53:06] youry but you had to
[1:53:09] hear you
[1:53:14] understand all out the scripture in the
[1:53:16] book of Acts
[1:53:18] leave there had to be a sermon
[1:53:22] preached so that the people there could
[1:53:25] respond amen amen you remember the
[1:53:30] Ethiopian he was he was sitting in his
[1:53:33] car he was on his
[1:53:35] Chariot read the Bible is that right he
[1:53:39] was reading
[1:53:41] Isaiah my hands and my
[1:53:43] Fe he could
[1:53:46] understand so God sent one
[1:53:48] of
[1:53:53] he said pH he said I got a
[1:54:00] son so he just took
[1:54:02] Philip put him right the car
[1:54:05] with right and the Bible said he
[1:54:10] expounded cuz what the Ethiopian unit
[1:54:13] couldn't
[1:54:14] understand this man speaking of
[1:54:17] himself all fell up just took
[1:54:22] and he he said hey here's
[1:54:26] water let's get it done real
[1:54:33] quick
[1:54:35] I you understand
[1:54:38] things when the Holy
[1:54:42] Ghost he went
[1:54:45] preaching so that seed life has to come
[1:54:48] through the body
[1:54:50] am am so it has to connect with the
[1:54:53] word because if we were chosen
[1:54:57] in we got to be able to see
[1:55:03] that so the part of the words you
[1:55:06] heard and responded
[1:55:09] to was the part or the
[1:55:13] attribute of God that he saw before the
[1:55:17] foundation that you would respond to
[1:55:20] that's why the word had to
[1:55:22] be that's why you had to be
[1:55:27] trust then he brought the
[1:55:29] word you were sitting one night day
[1:55:33] listening to a
[1:55:35] Ser
[1:55:43] or right amen amen cuz the life has to
[1:55:47] come down through the body
[1:55:50] you can't get this by
[1:56:01] yourself so what that person did when
[1:56:04] they brought you the
[1:56:06] word the book was
[1:56:08] closed you could
[1:56:10] understand
[1:56:12] am but when he
[1:56:14] open open the
[1:56:16] book you saw what you your name know he
[1:56:21] said all all that's what I've been
[1:56:23] looking
[1:56:25] for I've been looking for a
[1:56:29] waying
[1:56:36] for so that's why the
[1:56:38] book you can see your
[1:56:45] name
[1:56:48] everything when he
[1:56:50] scream you think we scream last
[1:56:56] night everybody
[1:57:04] in every
[1:57:10] diens
[1:57:15] my that's what you
[1:57:18] got but you got to see it in the
[1:57:21] word can't see it from man's
[1:57:24] IDE got to see your name in the word of
[1:57:28] God thats
[1:57:30] your amen so the part of the word you
[1:57:34] heard it
[1:57:37] responded this is my quote I come up
[1:57:39] with
[1:57:40] this came up with it I just wrote
[1:57:42] it the part of the word you heard and
[1:57:45] responded
[1:57:47] to God having for knowledge
[1:57:51] you would get
[1:57:53] here so he had this word for
[1:57:56] you because you know I'm respond to a
[1:57:59] different part of the Bible than
[1:58:04] you see
[1:58:06] genesis6 everything to
[1:58:09] me you may have
[1:58:14] your there6
[1:58:16] books sure they're all
[1:58:20] but I love
[1:58:22] genesis6 with
[1:58:23] me and I don't want you to say well
[1:58:28] that's that's second
[1:58:31] Revelation that's Paul we
[1:58:44] know and when you do God has to break
[1:58:58] the Holy
[1:58:59] Ghost
[1:59:01] burn all that
[1:59:12] old you can't understand the word of
[1:59:16] God oh you can get an intellectual
[1:59:25] without why could ethopian un not
[1:59:29] understand he didn't have a new
[1:59:32] birth but once
[1:59:37] Philip he actually brought the author
[1:59:40] with
[1:59:43] him I've always
[1:59:45] said brother Rand said you know you must
[1:59:48] get
[1:59:50] the spirit of the
[1:59:53] conductor and remember prophet of God
[1:59:56] said this is a love
[2:00:01] letter let me give you an
[2:00:04] example my wife and I been married 35
[2:00:08] years and sadly she's beginning to think
[2:00:10] like
[2:00:13] me she used to have a good
[2:00:15] mind her family her family say she lost
[2:00:18] her mind
[2:00:24] she lost her
[2:00:48] mind I to
[2:00:53] do tonight I swear you may need
[2:01:01] to
[2:01:04] my get his word
[2:01:13] out get out of we don't
[2:01:15] need just take up space
[2:01:20] part of the words you heard and
[2:01:21] responded
[2:01:25] to set aside for
[2:01:29] you so therefore we can be chosen in him
[2:01:36] amen the great
[2:01:39] mind of the
[2:01:43] conductor or the example that I'm going
[2:01:45] to give you that in your mind but sister
[2:01:48] Jun and I have been
[2:01:50] married 35 years we do think a lot of
[2:01:56] life we have become one live
[2:02:01] together now I can write her a love
[2:02:05] letter say I'm in
[2:02:07] Miami I'm at the Perfection
[2:02:10] church and I'm doing this and that
[2:02:12] other well now I can send her that
[2:02:16] letter okay okay or I can write a book
[2:02:21] and she knows exactly what I'm
[2:02:24] saying she
[2:02:26] experienc now if I take that
[2:02:33] book Hees he didn't
[2:02:37] experience
[2:02:38] WR see that's
[2:02:47] why
[2:02:49] it's the mind of the
[2:02:51] one that wrote the
[2:02:53] book is in
[2:02:56] you
[2:03:06] understand he can understand what he
[2:03:10] read
[2:03:13] that same way with the Bible we didn't
[2:03:17] understand
[2:03:20] alen but oh when he Dr that
[2:03:23] M and that thing clicked
[2:03:36] inside
[2:03:46] beening without God we can't
[2:03:52] I think we're
[2:03:57] a I believe the
[2:04:05] mind
[2:04:08] now two
[2:04:10] points in Reading
[2:04:12] scripture sometimes we read
[2:04:15] scripture and we don't see God's part
[2:04:22] but the way God
[2:04:26] SE am am so he can write a
[2:04:31] word be therefore
[2:04:35] perfect the B says there's perfect no
[2:04:40] not sometimes
[2:04:47] you
[2:04:52] but you got to
[2:04:54] remember stay
[2:04:56] there I got my
[2:04:58] instructions I've already given
[2:05:00] instructions if you're sitting
[2:05:03] here and you're on this side of
[2:05:06] Eternity and you're listening to what
[2:05:08] God Said through a
[2:05:11] minister now you're not already
[2:05:15] perfected
[2:05:17] amen but in God you
[2:05:20] are so that way he can write a positive
[2:05:24] word but he didn't just write that word
[2:05:37] so so that way I want you to
[2:05:40] read That's why
[2:05:42] that it covers a lot of things let's
[2:05:45] turn to
[2:05:46] Romans Romans 8
[2:05:53] now this scripture without
[2:05:56] Revelation cannot be
[2:05:59] comprehended Romans
[2:06:02] 81 how many of you been condemned this
[2:06:05] morning raise your
[2:06:08] hand
[2:06:10] your you have been
[2:06:12] condemned when you got up this morning

[2:06:17] go oh you is not
[2:06:20] right I can't do
[2:06:26] this don't raise your
[2:06:35] hand now what a
[2:06:38] scripture let's get on this side
[2:06:41] of there is
[2:06:44] therefore
[2:06:46] now no
[2:06:57] are
[2:07:02] after now let's read it with some
[2:07:06] understand there is therefore
[2:07:09] now no
[2:07:11] condemnation to them which are in
[2:07:16] Genesis who walk not
[2:07:34] that's what God speaking through Paul is
[2:07:37] telling you if you're born
[2:07:39] again that new birth
[2:07:45] allation and we don't walk after
[2:07:49] we walk in the we don't walk
[2:07:54] after am so read your scripture like
[2:07:58] that you got the Genesis 126
[2:08:03] Perfection
[2:08:06] remember never had a bad day never said
[2:08:09] a bad word never
[2:08:15] be it didn't fall it always was
[2:08:19] that's
[2:08:20] brother if you're born
[2:08:23] again
[2:08:27] always looking at
[2:08:29] this he said
[2:08:31] if you know that word if is
[2:08:43] only 11 if the spirit see asking you a
[2:08:48] question
[2:08:56] shall also
[2:09:01] Quicken don't say
[2:09:05] Immortal it
[2:09:08] says speaking
[2:09:12] of
[2:09:17] we we're already Qui we're
[2:09:21] already we need it now quick this
[2:09:30] guy all right let's break let's look at
[2:09:32] Ephesians
[2:09:34] 2 now remember of
[2:09:37] Ephesians they were a very mature
[2:09:40] Church they were very
[2:09:43] powerful it was a huge Church 12
[2:09:47] people
[2:09:52] amen some numbers don't mean
[2:10:10] anything so Paul is
[2:10:14] talking he says bless me verse three
[2:10:18] we're finishing right here blessed be
[2:10:20] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[2:10:23] Christ who is
[2:10:25] blessed everybody say us if you believe
[2:10:32] it with all spiritual
[2:10:37] blessing according as he has chosen Us
[2:10:41] in him now that word
[2:10:44] in we're not on this building tonight
[2:10:49] we're not around this
[2:10:52] building we we're in this building we
[2:10:56] have something
[2:10:59] around so if we're chosen in
[2:11:02] him all of
[2:11:12] that
[2:11:15] look watch this CU I the Apostle
[2:11:20] Paul he said that we should be
[2:11:25] holy and Without
[2:11:28] Blame before him in
[2:11:32] love now that's not talking on the
[2:11:35] earth there is that
[2:11:38] picture because look at verse five
[2:11:41] having
[2:11:43] predestinated unto the adoption
[2:11:47] of Jesus
[2:11:50] Christ according to the good
[2:11:56] pleasure to the
[2:11:59] praise
[2:12:02] His where he has made
[2:12:05] us
[2:12:07] AC in the
[2:12:12] belov so this is the development of the
[2:12:17] picture talking about
[2:12:21] Genesis because remember down here we're
[2:12:24] not
[2:12:25] holy come
[2:12:28] on this is
[2:12:30] not this is not blameless
[2:12:33] yet so in this scripture we see it in
[2:12:37] another
[2:12:38] dimension it's still a
[2:12:41] mystery amen amen amen having pred us
[2:12:46] the adop of children according to good
[2:12:50] pleasure of
[2:12:51] his where he made
[2:12:55] us that's in
[2:12:57] glory but you you can't stay there got
[2:13:01] come down so watch in whom we have
[2:13:06] Redemption now
[2:13:07] listen there's no redemption in
[2:13:12] heaven Mumble Mumble there's no
[2:13:16] redemp need
[2:13:19] Redemption the people in the
[2:13:23] six need
[2:13:26] Redemption Redemption happen the
[2:13:30] Earth if you fell on Earth this is
[2:13:35] where PA verse verse is brought it right
[2:13:40] down to the Earth amen amen in whom we
[2:13:44] have
[2:13:46] Redemption through his blood
[2:13:49] amen the forgiveness of sin don't need
[2:13:51] forgiveness
[2:13:55] of but Paul's bringing
[2:13:58] it according to the riches
[2:14:00] of wherein he have to bound
[2:14:04] it look at all these us and
[2:14:09] we in all wisdom and
[2:14:13] Prudence made
[2:14:16] known to
[2:14:19] us the
[2:14:21] mystery of his
[2:14:25] Willet
[2:14:28] word this is the reading of the
[2:14:31] well today we
[2:14:34] came we had a
[2:14:41] father did we had a father that
[2:14:45] died without the death of a testator
[2:14:47] there
[2:14:51] somebody died and when somebody died and
[2:14:55] you're part of the family you go to the
[2:14:57] reading of
[2:14:58] the you're in line if you're in line for
[2:15:04] something father your name
[2:15:10] in our
[2:15:13] word
[2:15:16] amen
[2:15:18] mystery of his will according to his
[2:15:21] good
[2:15:22] pleasure which he has per purpose in
[2:15:28] himself a you believe or
[2:15:33] not like I said I'm just to
[2:15:42] believe that in the
[2:15:44] dispensation of the fullness of time get
[2:15:48] that word time time 2,000
[2:15:51] years he's been building his brother
[2:15:54] 2,000 years in the
[2:15:57] dispensation of the Genesis
[2:16:00] 126 because when we're finished of
[2:16:08] time amen am he
[2:16:12] might in
[2:16:15] one what we talking about in one
[2:16:19] all things in
[2:16:21] Christ both which are in
[2:16:23] heaven and which are on earth even in
[2:16:27] him in him also we
[2:16:34] have remember didn't come to bring
[2:16:38] us we obtained it before the
[2:16:41] foundation knowledge of God knowing that
[2:16:44] we would choose we got here therefore he
[2:16:48] could choose
[2:16:49] us for found me that's
[2:16:53] simple in also we have obtained
[2:16:56] in being
[2:16:58] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:17:01] of him who work
[2:17:03] all after the Council of his own
[2:17:07] will that we should be to the praise of
[2:17:11] his
[2:17:14] glory who first trusted in
[2:17:16] Christ
[2:17:18] in whom you also
[2:17:20] trusted after now what we were talking
[2:17:25] about after you heard the word of
[2:17:29] Truth The
[2:17:31] Gospel of
[2:17:33] your put your name in there the gospel
[2:17:36] of your
[2:17:38] salvation you must believe that that
[2:17:42] he
[2:17:46] brought in whom also after that you
[2:17:51] believe you got to
[2:17:53] believe you were
[2:17:55] sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[2:17:58] pro now here's where we're going to stop
[2:18:01] here and pick up this
[2:18:03] afternoon because when you receive the
[2:18:06] new it's your
[2:18:11] Earnest
[2:18:12] family but it and it gives you Authority
[2:18:16] but it doesn't give you full
[2:18:19] because remember when you buy a home buy
[2:18:22] a
[2:18:24] car you have to put down earnest money
[2:18:27] or down
[2:18:28] payment now that down payment
[2:18:31] is because it begins youney making your
[2:18:36] pay so that earnest money is just as
[2:18:38] important as
[2:18:41] a but if you just put the earnest
[2:18:44] money what's going to happen
[2:18:48] you're going to
[2:18:49] Def amen God not going to take the holy
[2:18:53] ghost man will do that man come get

[2:19:14] what his daddy didn't Grill him for two
[2:19:16] hours why
[2:19:21] you he said thank
[2:19:26] God what a
[2:19:29] God when I was out in the world for
[2:19:31] years people were praying for
[2:19:35] me I didn't care I was doing the things
[2:19:38] of the
[2:19:41] world but the father Pap never
[2:19:45] forgot he knew
[2:19:48] where he knew exactly that if he cross
[2:19:52] my path one on Wednesday
[2:20:00] night I
[2:20:02] can't been there ever
[2:20:05] since but it's the earnest of our
[2:20:09] inheritance
[2:20:11] until the Redemption of The
[2:20:15] Possession the praise of his GL
[2:20:18] now what is what is the full when you
[2:20:20] pay your car off your

[2:20:26] time cuz you made all
[2:20:29] you and you get what get a
[2:20:40] title and you can do with whatever
[2:20:44] want
[2:20:46] amen see that heading toward
[2:20:50] adoption that's when you get full
[2:20:54] Authority see this is the earnest of our
[2:20:58] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[2:21:02] purchase which is Body Spirit and soul
[2:21:07] Satan still got a little bit
[2:21:11] hold but in
[2:21:15] God's it's
[2:21:20] he's got a glorified body
[2:21:24] got all to
[2:21:27] work but
[2:21:29] adoption is your name on the
[2:21:33] check not you and your
