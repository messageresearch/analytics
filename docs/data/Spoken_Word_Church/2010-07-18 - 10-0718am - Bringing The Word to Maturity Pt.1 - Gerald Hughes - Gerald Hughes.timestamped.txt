[33:31] here last night which was the largest
[33:33] amount i guess we've had in any of the
[33:36] meetings in this meeting here because we
[33:38] had to put out some seats to help
[33:40] everybody but we we appreciated it some
[33:42] of you you know the regulars were here
[33:44] we would have had you probably sitting
[33:45] downstairs because it was pretty well
[33:48] tied upstairs but we we thank you but we

[33:52] to be able to feed everybody and it was

[34:12] around face any left we'd had for you to
[34:14] have it you know but this just kind of
[34:16] be nice about it we thank brother and
[34:19] gary atkins back here he fixed the doors

[34:25] okay
[34:26] gary's right
[34:28] uh the doors were flopping and everybody
[34:29] was making a racket and we couldn't ever
[34:31] get everybody to stop running into it so
[34:34] you better not run into them now
[34:36] you're going to have a hurt hand because
[34:38] they don't move real quick
[34:40] so don't worry they will close slowly
[34:42] behind you
[34:43] as you go out so you will not be able to
[34:45] make a racket you know a lot of people
[34:47] want to be noticed so they make rackets
[34:50] you know and things but uh that's all
[34:52] right it's fixed now you can't do it so
[34:54] we'll all be the same all right but
[34:56] we're glad to have everybody right now
[34:58] brother hughes we did we had a wonderful
[35:00] time last night you missed the service i
[35:02] invite you to listen to the tape and all
[35:04] he done a wonderful job preaching on
[35:06] fellowship
[35:07] because i believe in fellowship
[35:09] you know i believe in that because it's
[35:11] a wonderful thing the prophet of god
[35:13] said one time
[35:14] if your church don't believe in
[35:16] fellowship
[35:17] he said get away from that cult
[35:20] now that's a direct quote so i don't say
[35:22] a lot of things i just leave it alone
[35:25] all right but a lot of people don't want
[35:26] to fellowship that's your business
[35:28] but that's what your prophet said
[35:30] but we just pray that the lord would
[35:32] bless you and guide you and and direct
[35:35] you and everything that he has for us
[35:37] and we pray that god will now today come
[35:40] and open our hearts right amen so let's
[35:42] just sing only believe
[35:45] as our brother comes to bring the word
[35:47] of the lord unto us and he will be

[41:39] which we have heard
[41:43] which we have seen with our eyes which
[41:46] we've looked upon and our hands have
[41:49] handled
[41:50] of the word of life
[41:52] for the life was manifested and we have
[41:55] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[41:57] you that eternal life which was with the
[42:00] father and was manifested unto us

[44:05] something huh she sings a
[44:07] lot of several different songs

[44:11] will let her
[44:12] and uh
[44:14] get her mic'd up there by the way i
[44:15] appreciate it
[44:17] amen
[44:47] in my life
[44:50] was tested by
[44:54] some major trial
[45:01] when the temple
[45:14] when
[45:15] darkness tries to hide
[45:19] the sun from my pathway
[45:24] hear me love
[45:27] then
[45:31] a jesus
[45:33] special grace
[45:46] in times of trouble
[45:52] a
[45:53] very special
[45:56] place
[46:11] to heal
[46:13] all my heartaches
[46:18] now
[46:19] jesus wants to give
[46:23] that special grace
[46:26] to you
[46:33] i
[46:34] know
[46:35] that i was never
[46:39] ever worthy
[46:45] my sin
[46:50] demanded he punished
[46:58] but i know
[46:59] christ took my place upon
[47:10] his very special grace
[47:14] it's here just to see me through
[47:34] a
[47:35] very special grace
[47:40] to
[47:41] see you through
[47:53] just to heal all your heartaches
[47:59] now
[48:01] jesus wants to give
[48:04] that's
[48:14] amen
[48:18] hey
[48:22] thank you sister hughes i appreciate
[48:23] that
[48:25] again before we get in before i try to
[48:29] uh get into the message i would like to
[48:31] express again my appreciation for
[48:34] the invitation
[48:36] and the privilege of being here
[48:41] you know i believe it's a wonderful
[48:43] thing
[48:44] a great honor to be able to speak to
[48:47] god's bride
[48:49] and
[48:50] i often think of how the prophet said if
[48:53] i had just a little drop
[48:55] of the literal blood of the lord jesus
[48:58] in a vial how i'd hold it close
[49:00] you know to my heart lest when i walk i
[49:03] might spill it or something
[49:06] oh how sacred it would be
[49:08] to have a literal drop of the blood of
[49:10] jehovah
[49:11] you know he wasn't a jew or a gentile
[49:14] it was the created blood of god that we
[49:16] were redeemed by
[49:18] and he said but you know this morning i
[49:20] have something more precious in my hands
[49:23] the purchase of that blood
[49:26] how many have been purchased by the
[49:28] blood
[49:30] the lord that's more precious
[49:33] amen and then to have
[49:36] that in your hand brother
[49:39] to be a pastor of a church is a great
[49:41] and a sacred responsibility
[49:43] because you're entrusting your soul
[49:46] amen into the hands of those who handle
[49:49] the word of god
[49:50] and so therefore we don't take this
[49:52] lightly
[49:53] and
[49:54] we must realize each one of us as
[49:56] individuals that we are precious in the
[49:59] sight of the lord
[50:02] more precious than his own blood or he
[50:04] had never gave his blood for your
[50:06] redemption
[50:08] the transaction would have never
[50:11] been made
[50:13] if he didn't love you more
[50:15] amen
[50:16] than his own
[50:18] amen son his created blood he
[50:21] his life
[50:22] through his son
[50:24] oh my amen god made you pay for your
[50:26] sins
[50:28] when he put christ to sleep at calvary
[50:30] the first adam
[50:33] god had not yet separated the bride
[50:36] from the groom
[50:38] when god put the first adam to sleep and
[50:40] the same thing when he put the second
[50:42] adam's sleep we were in christ
[50:45] when he died
[50:46] you died come on all right
[50:49] amen living he loved me died he saved me
[50:52] buried he carried my sins far away
[50:56] why did he say
[51:00] my god my god why has that forsaken me
[51:04] it was your sins on
[51:06] him because in the book of hosea thou
[51:09] are all together too holy to even behold
[51:12] sin
[51:14] cursed is every man that hangeth on a
[51:16] tree
[51:18] he was cursed by your sins for my sake
[51:21] for your sakes
[51:22] living he loved me
[51:24] dying he saved me cat buried he carried
[51:27] my sins
[51:28] he had my sins he didn't have any of his
[51:30] son
[51:31] he had my sins and he carried them far
[51:34] away you know that's what they done the
[51:37] scapegoat
[51:38] the high priest confessed all the sins
[51:41] you know of the nation put it on that
[51:42] escape building and the prophet said he
[51:45] the lamb of god became a goat for you
[51:47] all right all that steak goat was a type
[51:50] of christ what a goat yes
[51:54] cursed a goat
[51:57] a scapegoat they they let they confess
[51:59] all the sin said turn him into the
[52:01] wilderness take him way out of no men's
[52:03] uncivilized you know in the wilderness
[52:05] and there let him
[52:07] die i don't know what happened to him
[52:09] there
[52:10] but i don't have to worry about what
[52:11] happened we know what happened to our
[52:13] sins there was absolutely an alley
[52:15] cast into the sea of god's forgetfulness
[52:18] never to be remembered hey hey look did
[52:21] you ever think about it
[52:24] god see living he loved me dying he
[52:27] saved me buried he carried my sins for a
[52:28] way rising he justified him
[52:32] rising he justified
[52:34] really forever
[52:36] and
[52:37] this day he's coming oh glorious day
[52:41] this day he's coming oh what a glorious
[52:44] day
[52:45] but do you realize did you ever stop to
[52:46] think god could not have resurrected
[52:50] jesus christ until he first justified
[52:52] you
[52:55] god could not have just
[52:57] resurrected jesus christ with those sins
[53:00] still on him see
[53:02] rising he justified right
[53:05] oh
[53:06] my amen glory think about it that's
[53:09] right god the father with his own faith
[53:12] the prophet put it like this
[53:14] god
[53:15] the father with his own faith foresee
[53:19] you and me out there
[53:21] and believing with his own faith now
[53:23] god's faith which he invites us to use
[53:25] see there's only one faith
[53:29] he foreseen us already glorified
[53:31] believing that we would hold to the
[53:33] message and be an overcomer
[53:36] and he already spoke it
[53:39] for all that he for dude
[53:42] he did also pre-dish things
[53:44] you believe you're almost 8 28 what
[53:46] about 29 and 30 then
[53:48] what about romans 28 29-30
[53:51] oh all things work together for the good
[53:53] those who love the lord or they call the
[53:55] courtney's purpose we believe that
[53:57] but those
[53:59] whom he for knew he called
[54:03] those that he called see
[54:05] he did predestinate thank you those he
[54:07] predestined he called and he called him
[54:10] and he justified him and he had
[54:12] sanctified him and he has also glorified
[54:16] it's a it's a finished work folks
[54:19] it's a finished work but he wants us to
[54:21] believe in it and be sure that to make
[54:23] our calling and election sure
[54:25] appropriate these things that's right
[54:27] they stand on the word of god
[54:29] amen be an overcomer
[54:33] we want to hold our balance in
[54:34] predestination right exactly
[54:37] uh in the fourth seal the prophet spoke
[54:40] of how that when christ returns with his
[54:42] bride to set up the millennium you know
[54:44] there's three comings
[54:46] comes to redeem his bride comes to get
[54:48] his bride then he comes with his bride
[54:50] and the next coming is he's coming to
[54:52] get us
[54:54] and we're in that coming now
[54:56] is that right blessing the holy see they
[54:57] have part in the first resurrection out
[54:59] resurrection from among the dead
[55:02] the second death has no power or these
[55:05] rule and reign with christ a thousand
[55:06] years but we see then
[55:09] that we want to be counted worthy to be
[55:10] in that number
[55:12] and
[55:14] as we
[55:15] uh prepare
[55:17] for the coming of the lord we want to
[55:21] remember now we have
[55:23] to qualify
[55:25] right sure
[55:27] there are some qualifications
[55:29] there's some requirements to be made
[55:31] right
[55:32] the waiting garment's garbage gotta be
[55:33] on all right all right
[55:35] hey man
[55:36] there's some whoa
[55:38] if we are predestinating we believe we
[55:40] are
[55:40] sure but what are we predestined unto
[55:44] say predestinated to be conformed to the
[55:47] image of his dear son
[55:49] if there's not some transforming and
[55:51] conforming to that image what is that
[55:53] image the reveal word of the hour
[55:55] see
[55:56] and so there brother branham said in the
[55:59] fourth seal he said
[56:01] when christ
[56:03] is returning on a white horse and all
[56:06] those fallen with him on white horses
[56:09] the bible says with him are the call the
[56:11] chosen and the faithful all right amen
[56:14] brother brown put us up on this order
[56:16] you'll find it in the fourth seal he
[56:17] said
[56:18] see
[56:19] paul
[56:20] are chosen before the foundation of the
[56:22] world amen chosen you believe you're
[56:24] chosen amen see
[56:27] called
[56:29] by the word of god the gospel of your
[56:31] salvation i'll say by the message of the
[56:33] hour call
[56:34] thee
[56:36] and then here now see that was god's
[56:38] choosing you didn't choose him
[56:41] he chose you
[56:42] but then he says call
[56:44] see chosen call and faithful to the word
[56:48] by their own choosing right amen oh
[56:51] now there's where you got something into
[56:53] it there
[56:55] faithful to the word by their own
[56:57] choosing right see brother said if god
[57:00] was to grab you in a pipe poke you in
[57:02] and then reach in and pull you out the
[57:04] other end and say blessed is the
[57:05] overcomer you wouldn't have nothing to
[57:06] do into it but you've got to choose to
[57:09] be faithful to this world he is looking
[57:12] for a faithful bride
[57:14] he's looking for a
[57:16] mature right all right that's right
[57:19] thank you lord
[57:21] and um
[57:22] i want to background just a little bit
[57:24] now from yesterday before we go into
[57:26] this subject this morning
[57:29] of
[57:30] bringing the word to full maturity in
[57:32] our lives
[57:36] you know when you receive the holy ghost
[57:38] it's kind of like christ in baby form in
[57:40] you
[57:41] amen
[57:43] amen but you know song of solomon i
[57:46] believe one said
[57:47] there in the scriptures we have a little
[57:50] sister yes and what shall we do in the
[57:53] day that she's spoken for
[57:55] for she has no breast
[57:57] see
[57:58] we must bring this word to full maturity
[58:02] and when it comes to that place it'll be
[58:05] what you're seeing right here
[58:08] the stature of a perfect man
[58:11] and it'll be no longer
[58:13] she it'll be he
[58:16] she and he is one of them
[58:20] he who now letteth
[58:23] will let
[58:24] thee
[58:25] until he be taken out of the way
[58:28] amen
[58:29] and that's one scripture where the
[58:31] prophet of god identified the church not
[58:33] just in in feminine but in masculine
[58:36] he shall be taken out of the way
[58:39] the only thing that's keeping the
[58:41] judgments
[58:42] from striking and the tribulation from
[58:45] really fully setting you now we're in a
[58:46] little lap over now as it were
[58:48] preparation you know but when the
[58:50] tribulation really sets in
[58:53] what really does that is when the
[58:54] bride's taken out of the way
[58:57] hey do you realize you're the
[58:58] restraining force right that holds this
[59:01] whole thing together
[59:06] see and so we want to see the importance
[59:09] of letting the word come to full
[59:11] maturity now and we believe that
[59:14] fellowship is very much an element in
[59:16] that
[59:19] and uh yesterday my subject was
[59:21] fellowshipping onto
[59:24] relationships
[59:25] fellowship onto relationship
[59:28] and uh
[59:30] i didn't have time or it didn't take the
[59:32] time
[59:33] that uh
[59:34] nobody's pulling my coattail but i just
[59:36] didn't feel like you know to
[59:39] linger yesterday but i want to go back
[59:41] and hit a couple highlights that i
[59:42] missed in my notes
[59:44] and uh one of them here
[59:46] is uh that had come to my heart that i
[59:49] wanted to share with you
[59:51] uh comes from the second coming of the
[59:53] lord where the prophet of god
[59:56] makes this statement when he's talking
[59:57] about the little woman that had lost one
[59:59] of the coins out of her tablet you know
[1:00:01] that was her sign that she was married
[1:00:03] and was faithful
[1:00:06] and uh here in this message second
[1:00:08] coming of the lord he says this
[1:00:10] now she had a house cleaning time
[1:00:14] right she scrubbed the floors she swept
[1:00:16] the walls she took down the cobwebs
[1:00:20] what was it see i was i was headed here
[1:00:22] and then then i got off on that cobweb
[1:00:25] story
[1:00:26] moe's and the cobwebs and it may be just
[1:00:28] a little too light and i but i want to
[1:00:30] come back and get this
[1:00:33] she
[1:00:35] took down the cobwebs
[1:00:40] she kept on until she fell what she had
[1:00:43] lost
[1:00:44] now he's talking about the bride of
[1:00:46] christ having lost something we've lost
[1:00:47] something folks right right
[1:00:49] amen amen
[1:00:51] amen down through the ages the church
[1:00:53] has lost something right
[1:00:55] exactly
[1:00:58] all right
[1:01:00] she found what she lost and when she did
[1:01:03] she called her sister churches
[1:01:06] to come now right
[1:01:09] come on in let's fellowship i want to
[1:01:11] show you what i found
[1:01:13] oh
[1:01:14] my
[1:01:15] god she was in a
[1:01:16] she was in a strength her husband was
[1:01:18] coming
[1:01:19] it was the coming of the lord he was
[1:01:21] coming home
[1:01:23] and if he caught her in that position
[1:01:25] with one of the coins missing white be
[1:01:27] like a harlot right
[1:01:29] but now
[1:01:30] she invites her sister churches to come
[1:01:33] down okay but lay some strong meat now
[1:01:36] listen to this
[1:01:37] i don't care if you're methodist
[1:01:40] baptist pentecostal presbyterian come
[1:01:43] let us rejoice together right
[1:01:45] when that time come
[1:01:47] when the church finds its holy love a
[1:01:51] brotherly love
[1:01:53] when the church finds its holy decency
[1:01:56] when the church finds its place in
[1:01:59] christ it'll call the other members of
[1:02:01] the body come and rejoice with us
[1:02:10] see the importance of fellowship
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] there must be
[1:02:16] see that was the whole purpose of god
[1:02:19] in the message discerning of spirits he
[1:02:21] said
[1:02:22] that if a man has the spirit of god
[1:02:24] he'll have the action of god and the
[1:02:26] action of god is never to break us up
[1:02:29] but the action of god is always to bring
[1:02:32] us
[1:02:32] together amen
[1:02:34] sure
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:38] and
[1:02:39] we see here he also makes this statement
[1:02:42] if you're a christian you long to go
[1:02:44] where other christians are and
[1:02:46] fellowship with other christians
[1:02:48] so you cannot stay away from church and
[1:02:50] live the same life
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] you you can't do it right because it's
[1:02:57] like

[1:03:07] going to do it
[1:03:09] see
[1:03:10] you've got to go and feed on the word of
[1:03:12] god and fellowship with one another

[1:03:36] need good godly brotherly fellowship and
[1:03:39] support listen to what he says here we
[1:03:41] need one another
[1:03:44] more now than we ever need each other
[1:03:47] is now right when you get yourself
[1:03:51] singled out from the rest of them making
[1:03:53] yourself just a little different
[1:03:56] i've done it right now i'm tempted i've
[1:03:59] been tempted i've i've been guilty
[1:04:03] hey
[1:04:04] you don't want to associate with them
[1:04:05] because they believe this
[1:04:08] don't want to associate with that
[1:04:11] you're getting on dangerous grounds
[1:04:14] that's right brother amen
[1:04:20] i've been on thin ice before and i fell
[1:04:22] through before
[1:04:24] you know what you're on dangerous ground
[1:04:27] and those aren't mountains of arkansas i
[1:04:29] was raised up
[1:04:32] jerked up with the hair of the head they
[1:04:33] say you know
[1:04:35] and uh
[1:04:37] we didn't have electricity
[1:04:38] we had that kind of water that you run
[1:04:40] out and draw you know the well or run
[1:04:43] down to the river and take a bath
[1:04:45] raised on the banks of war eagle river
[1:04:48] there is one of the fastest fallen
[1:04:49] rivers in the ozark mountains
[1:04:51] and we didn't discover electricity in
[1:04:53] 1957 i was 11 years old
[1:04:55] at that time
[1:04:57] and uh but we escaped sometimes in the
[1:05:00] wintertime the you know the the river
[1:05:02] wouldn't be running and just have pools
[1:05:05] in it like you know it wouldn't be
[1:05:06] running too much just over the shoals
[1:05:07] and and it would freeze up
[1:05:10] and it'd be a good place to go down and

[1:07:43] if it's a word in season then it's a
[1:07:45] word that's never been in season before
[1:07:48] not a different word
[1:07:49] but something that god wants for us this
[1:07:52] morning right right
[1:07:54] oh my listen now
[1:07:56] see
[1:07:58] that's the success of my
[1:08:00] meetings is because real godly people
[1:08:03] pray for me
[1:08:04] that's it
[1:08:06] that's the reason
[1:08:08] success in my meetings
[1:08:10] when i come in and introduce these
[1:08:13] things about the visions and things
[1:08:15] there's many old mother and dad
[1:08:18] sister or brother sitting out there that
[1:08:21] believe
[1:08:22] that with all their heart the holy
[1:08:24] spirit drops
[1:08:25] down on them then
[1:08:28] and uh if they didn't do that
[1:08:30] i have no way of doing it
[1:08:32] no matter how great it would be for
[1:08:35] myself
[1:08:36] it had to be for
[1:08:38] you the same
[1:08:40] we have to do a unit
[1:08:43] two of us together to make the contact
[1:08:46] with god
[1:08:48] you as a believer myself as a
[1:08:50] believer all right now we're going to

[1:09:27] how many older brothers
[1:09:29] i don't know maybe some of the younger
[1:09:30] brothers too but
[1:09:32] you know it's hard for a man to scratch
[1:09:34] his own back especially when he gets
[1:09:35] stiff stoop shoulder like i am you know
[1:09:39] you you need somebody to scratch your
[1:09:40] back for you

[1:10:07] you can't scratch your own back

[1:10:11] not very good unless you get up against
[1:10:12] old oak tree with scrub bark or
[1:10:14] something you know
[1:10:15] really and you know sometimes if they
[1:10:17] just barely scratch for the deal
[1:10:19] it just makes it worse
[1:10:22] you know what i say scratch huh
[1:10:27] hey why would you say that brother
[1:10:29] hughes you don't sound very spiritual

[1:11:18] see it's a want-to situation right is
[1:11:20] that right right oh
[1:11:22] my
[1:11:23] it gets to where you
[1:11:25] it's not just putting up with one
[1:11:26] another you get where you can't do
[1:11:27] without one man right there you realize
[1:11:29] the importance of one another
[1:11:31] love and protection and prayer and that
[1:11:34] godly affections and bonds that's what
[1:11:36] we want right
[1:11:38] amen when a church finds his holy
[1:11:40] decency it's pretty love
[1:11:42] where's it at
[1:11:43] amen if you haven't got in your heart
[1:11:47] start sweeping

[1:11:57] one of the first things we mentioned
[1:11:58] yesterday that the devil eat away from
[1:12:00] the church was those the bride tree come
[1:12:03] in the form of the locust destroyed the
[1:12:05] the leaves on the tree which represented
[1:12:07] fellowship brother
[1:12:08] but this ain't your restoration
[1:12:12] this is your restoration
[1:12:14] oh my
[1:12:16] yes
[1:12:16] and you know
[1:12:20] he said that
[1:12:25] we are
[1:12:26] leafs on the tree of life
[1:12:29] what
[1:12:30] leafs
[1:12:32] right
[1:12:33] leafs on the tree of life all right
[1:12:37] i'm the man you're the branches all
[1:12:39] right ain't that saint john 15 5
[1:12:42] that's the bible what
[1:12:45] we're part of the tree of life right
[1:12:47] well let's say the message restoration
[1:12:49] of the bride tree
[1:12:51] the prophet of god said bride and groom
[1:12:54] one
[1:12:55] tree
[1:12:56] of life amen black husband and wife
[1:13:00] is one amen is that too strong for you
[1:13:03] go ahead true all right this is the
[1:13:04] truth all right god obama's god with us
[1:13:07] god in us amen
[1:13:09] oh it was incred god he poured into
[1:13:11] christ all's in christ he pours into the
[1:13:13] bride the church
[1:13:16] christ in bride form right amen
[1:13:19] that's the revelation
[1:13:22] bride and groom like husband and wife is
[1:13:25] one
[1:13:25] one tree of life
[1:13:28] see keep thine heart with all diligence
[1:13:31] for out of it are the issues of life
[1:13:33] see the thoughts of god the word of god
[1:13:35] in your heart right amen and then as a
[1:13:37] man think of these hearts so is he
[1:13:39] that's what you're going to express out
[1:13:40] see and you produce the fruits of the
[1:13:43] righteous is a tree of life right words
[1:13:45] of the righteousness
[1:13:47] and so the only way you can serve god or
[1:13:49] the only way i can serve god period
[1:13:53] is to receive god's servant exactly
[1:13:56] as god interprets the word to you
[1:13:58] through him and god has sent us a
[1:14:01] vindicated serpent amen and we just
[1:14:04] believe it that's just it we love it and
[1:14:05] we believe it is that right
[1:14:07] oh
[1:14:08] my yes absolute
[1:14:11] amen divine interpretation of the
[1:14:13] written word of god
[1:14:15] in this hour
[1:14:16] amen he didn't just say it
[1:14:18] but
[1:14:19] um now if you don't want a fellowship
[1:14:21] hey guess what
[1:14:23] and even if you do want a fellowship
[1:14:25] you might be headed for forced
[1:14:27] fellowship
[1:14:28] in alaska
[1:14:31] right
[1:14:32] because two or three different places
[1:14:34] where brother brown said they got a
[1:14:36] place already prepared up there
[1:14:38] suggested it pretty strongly anyway
[1:14:42] where they're going to take all these
[1:14:43] oddballs they don't believe
[1:14:45] just exactly like the world comes from
[1:14:47] churches
[1:14:50] how many like go to alaska yeah
[1:14:55] i mean it's already been there
[1:14:57] i have two
[1:14:58] i kind of like it up there
[1:15:02] but it might not be it's a good way to
[1:15:03] go
[1:15:04] you know have a little province i think
[1:15:06] you said for us
[1:15:08] well if they did that you know what it
[1:15:10] just
[1:15:11] it just get us together we sure have to
[1:15:13] fellowship then
[1:15:16] we probably need one another to stretch
[1:15:18] one another's back and keep one another
[1:15:20] warm
[1:15:21] oh
[1:15:22] yes god's working
[1:15:26] he's going to do this thing whether we
[1:15:28] think he is or not he didn't ask me
[1:15:30] about it he didn't ask you about it
[1:15:32] this bride is his workmanship
[1:15:35] created under good works right the bride
[1:15:38] groom creating himself a bride and she's
[1:15:41] going to have this character
[1:15:44] it's hard for you to kick against the
[1:15:46] pricks right
[1:15:49] you know a prick is what they
[1:15:51] for my understanding to go the ox with
[1:15:54] right you know get him i'll go over this
[1:15:55] way a sharp pointy stick and goad
[1:15:58] and if that lock kicked against it it
[1:16:00] just hurt that much worse
[1:16:03] and that's what paul was doing right
[1:16:05] but you know what
[1:16:07] i've surrendered his life to me
[1:16:11] that 17th fight that brother branham was
[1:16:14] in as a professional fighter yeah
[1:16:18] he said god if you let me get through
[1:16:19] this one
[1:16:21] i promise you i'll never fight again
[1:16:24] what was it
[1:16:25] god is a stronger fighter than any one
[1:16:28] of you all right
[1:16:29] he's able to surrender you to himself
[1:16:31] and he'll use your trials he'll use the
[1:16:33] circumstances he'll use the battles
[1:16:35] whatever it is
[1:16:37] oh you'll use afflictions many are the
[1:16:39] afflictions of the righteousness
[1:16:43] not just because you're seeing that they
[1:16:44] come upon you necessarily but he's
[1:16:46] molding character
[1:16:48] right salvation is a gift character is a
[1:16:51] victory no battle no entry
[1:16:53] greater than battle greater than victory
[1:16:56] right now but we must have fellowship is
[1:16:58] that true
[1:17:00] return in jubilee 62 brother man makes
[1:17:02] mistake
[1:17:04] but if you sold your inheritance and you
[1:17:08] if you
[1:17:09] sold out
[1:17:10] and done these things what am i saying
[1:17:13] return back
[1:17:15] if you joined up with some cult
[1:17:18] cult
[1:17:19] if you joined up with some cult that
[1:17:22] tries to keep you away from fellowship
[1:17:25] with other brethren leave the thing
[1:17:28] this is jubilee amen i feel religious
[1:17:31] return return this is you believe don't
[1:17:34] let it pass by remember don't let it
[1:17:36] pass by
[1:17:37] the prophet's definition of a cult
[1:17:40] is an attitude
[1:17:42] or a church that keeps you from
[1:17:44] fellowship with other brethren
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] ye are the salt of the earth whose
[1:17:51] purpose is steady for joy and good
[1:17:54] fellowship you always are ready
[1:17:57] amen that's the attitude of the bride
[1:17:59] is that true sure i'm sure
[1:18:01] we don't want to have to be a forced
[1:18:03] thing
[1:18:04] desperation should be out of love
[1:18:07] not out of just an emergency
[1:18:09] amen but god's going to bring it one way
[1:18:11] or another
[1:18:13] i was thinking i'm going to get back
[1:18:14] into this here after a while murray and
[1:18:17] uh elizabeth
[1:18:19] were white cousins
[1:18:21] talk about a fellowship meeting they had
[1:18:23] a fellowship meet lasted three months
[1:18:25] yeah right yeah
[1:18:27] luke 157
[1:18:29] or 56 we'll read it here in a minute but
[1:18:32] see uh i believe in fellowship meetings
[1:18:37] yes sir we don't want to
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] uh
[1:18:42] yes
[1:18:44] see like husband and wife are one
[1:18:48] and i i this one little point i missed
[1:18:50] yesterday i want to weave it in
[1:18:53] uh
[1:18:54] that way i'll
[1:18:55] you know
[1:18:57] brother brown preached a message one
[1:18:59] time on rest and we didn't get that one
[1:19:01] on tape
[1:19:02] but if you go back and check it it was
[1:19:04] probably about two or three hours long
[1:19:06] and you know where he preached to that
[1:19:08] in his bed chamber
[1:19:10] i was talking about you know the seven
[1:19:12] steps leading up
[1:19:14] from fellowship up to relationship
[1:19:16] you know maybe over here in the
[1:19:19] in the living room you have a little
[1:19:21] fellowship and in the kitchen you have a
[1:19:23] closer fellowship but in the bedroom
[1:19:25] amen that's where you have relationships
[1:19:28] and god wants a relationship not just a
[1:19:31] fellowship
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:34] i was
[1:19:35] thinking along this line you know and
[1:19:38] and the prophet
[1:19:40] said i my wife was asleep
[1:19:42] yeah she'd be a type of the bride is
[1:19:45] that true
[1:19:46] in the king's chamber and he called that
[1:19:48] the prophet's chamber also as well as
[1:19:49] the king's chamber seven steps uh in the
[1:19:52] pyramid leading up to exactly way up
[1:19:55] here in the top level there is where
[1:19:57] that bed chamber is that secret chamber
[1:20:00] right oh my right
[1:20:03] each age had a dip in the holy ghost
[1:20:06] but here the holy ghost himself comes
[1:20:08] right amen you know he said the fullness
[1:20:11] of the holy ghost
[1:20:13] right who is that that's the lord jesus
[1:20:15] christ
[1:20:23] elijah could not leave until he
[1:20:25] introduced the messiah that's right
[1:20:26] that's right
[1:20:28] right
[1:20:28] then he said i must decrease that he
[1:20:30] might increase that's it right there
[1:20:32] oh
[1:20:34] my
[1:20:35] see
[1:20:36] the reveal word is your husband
[1:20:39] you're shut in with him in a smear
[1:20:41] relationship in the invisible union
[1:20:43] right amen right oh my yes
[1:20:48] but see here's the prophet now in the
[1:20:49] prophet's chamber
[1:20:51] preaching a message not to the public
[1:20:53] brother dale
[1:20:54] justice bride alone
[1:20:57] this is not for
[1:20:58] everybody oh brother
[1:21:02] and you know what it was rest amen
[1:21:05] rest
[1:21:07] do you know faith itself perfect faith
[1:21:08] comes up here right
[1:21:11] you know what it's based on down
[1:21:12] here exactly
[1:21:15] it's based on forgiveness faith is based
[1:21:17] on forgiveness
[1:21:19] that's right amen forgiving one another
[1:21:22] fellowship with one another loving one
[1:21:24] another faith which worketh by love
[1:21:29] and so we see
[1:21:30] that
[1:21:32] he woke her up out of natural rest she
[1:21:34] was asleep
[1:21:36] he walked he said it was just burning on
[1:21:37] my heart i had to have somebody some
[1:21:39] release
[1:21:40] no he didn't just take notes he preached
[1:21:43] it
[1:21:44] he preached it right in his bed and she
[1:21:47] rose up she roused up he said she's
[1:21:48] pretty good congregation
[1:21:51] captive congregation
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:54] she rose up and woke up and he preached
[1:21:58] right to her in the bed
[1:22:00] well talk about fellowship and
[1:22:02] relationship in the same man
[1:22:05] oh what about a comfortable position
[1:22:07] that peter preached to right in your
[1:22:09] face amen that's where the bride is
[1:22:12] in the secret chamber that's right
[1:22:16] shot in
[1:22:18] with god in a secret place
[1:22:22] there in the spirit beholding his face
[1:22:28] gaining new power
[1:22:30] to run in life's race right oh i love to
[1:22:34] be shut in with
[1:22:37] yes god in the bride sealed in see shut
[1:22:39] in and and the whole thing is based on
[1:22:42] rest
[1:22:44] not in running
[1:22:46] but in resting
[1:22:48] not in trying but entrusting
[1:22:52] and it's not in wondering but in praying
[1:22:56] that we find the strength of the lord
[1:23:01] think about it rest see ruth deciding

[1:25:05] now
[1:25:06] let's go now
[1:25:08] if you'll just give me your undivided
[1:25:09] attention for a few more minutes
[1:25:11] let's go
[1:25:13] to
[1:25:14] uh luke
[1:25:16] let's go to luke
[1:25:18] and we'll begin here i won't require you
[1:25:21] unless you want to just change your
[1:25:23] position a little bit
[1:25:24] uh you know that'd be all right too but
[1:25:26] i won't require you to stand necessarily
[1:25:29] but let's begin here
[1:25:31] with uh chapter 1
[1:25:34] and verse 26 and in the sixth month
[1:25:37] the angel gabriel was sent from god
[1:25:41] into a city of galilee named nazareth
[1:25:44] to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name
[1:25:47] was joseph
[1:25:48] of the house of david and the virgin's
[1:25:51] name was mary
[1:25:52] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:25:54] hail thou
[1:25:56] that art highly favored of the lord
[1:26:00] uh the lord is with thee blessed art
[1:26:02] thou among women and when she saw him
[1:26:05] she was troubled at
[1:26:07] his saying and cast in her mind what
[1:26:10] manner of salutation this should be and
[1:26:12] the angel said unto her fear not mary
[1:26:14] for thou hast found favor with god and
[1:26:17] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:26:19] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:26:22] name
[1:26:23] jesus
[1:26:25] and he shall
[1:26:27] shall be great and shall be called the
[1:26:29] son of the highest and the lord god
[1:26:32] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:26:35] father david and he shall reign over the
[1:26:38] house of jacob forever
[1:26:40] and his kingdom
[1:26:43] of his kingdom there shall be no
[1:26:46] end glory
[1:26:48] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[1:26:51] this be see i know no man
[1:26:54] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:26:56] the holy ghost
[1:26:58] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:27:00] the highest
[1:27:02] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[1:27:04] that holy thing which shall be borne of
[1:27:06] thee shall be called the son of god
[1:27:09] and behold thy cousin
[1:27:11] elizabeth
[1:27:13] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:27:17] age
[1:27:18] this is the sixth month with her right
[1:27:22] now remember elizabeth's already six
[1:27:24] months before mary goes to her
[1:27:27] all right
[1:27:29] i think the the
[1:27:31] uh it's about nine months is the is the
[1:27:33] span is that right
[1:27:35] with her who was called barren for with
[1:27:38] god nothing shall be impossible and mary
[1:27:43] said behold the hands made of the lord
[1:27:46] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:27:49] and the angel departed from her and
[1:27:52] murray arose in those days and went into
[1:27:54] the hill country with haste
[1:27:57] under the city
[1:27:58] of
[1:27:59] uh judah right
[1:28:01] now i want you to just skip over with me
[1:28:03] here to verse 56 and murray abode with
[1:28:07] her
[1:28:08] about three months
[1:28:10] and returned to her own house what about
[1:28:13] a fellowship meeting
[1:28:15] three month long fellowship meeting
[1:28:17] and did you ever stop thinking about it
[1:28:19] here is
[1:28:21] well maybe we'll just go to it i'll
[1:28:23] share with you here what the prophet of
[1:28:25] god said about
[1:28:27] about mary and elizabeth
[1:28:29] listen to this
[1:28:30] now
[1:28:32] and we're going to come to something
[1:28:34] how would you mothers that are here this
[1:28:36] morning
[1:28:37] or even the young sisters that maybe you
[1:28:40] know mary was only about 16 or 18 years
[1:28:42] old
[1:28:43] at this time
[1:28:44] how would you like to have that
[1:28:46] responsibility
[1:28:48] of conceiving the word
[1:28:52] nursing the word
[1:28:54] and bringing that word up
[1:28:56] in the full maturity in the fear and
[1:28:58] admonition of the lord
[1:29:01] how would you men here like to have been
[1:29:03] jumped
[1:29:04] who have that responsibility
[1:29:07] of receiving the word
[1:29:11] teaching and tutoring
[1:29:12] and bringing that word to full maturity
[1:29:16] that's my subject in the little sunday
[1:29:18] school lesson this morning
[1:29:19] bringing the word to maturity in your
[1:29:23] life amen
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:26] christ in you that's right for glory
[1:29:29] that's right
[1:29:31] whether we would like you or not and we
[1:29:33] should like it every believer would like
[1:29:35] that i'm sure but we have that same
[1:29:37] responsibility right
[1:29:40] not another jesus
[1:29:42] the same jesus
[1:29:45] not another spirit the same spirit right
[1:29:49] right oh
[1:29:50] my
[1:29:52] and
[1:29:54] we each one have that responsibility
[1:29:57] right that's right
[1:30:03] pergament church h
[1:30:04] church hmm chapter 5 here is the secret
[1:30:08] is this the word is in the bride as it
[1:30:11] was in mary amen
[1:30:15] amen he is in the bride amen exactly as
[1:30:19] it was in mary the bride has the mind of
[1:30:22] christ for she knows what he wants done
[1:30:24] with the word right
[1:30:26] she performs the command of the word in
[1:30:29] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[1:30:33] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:30:35] and it comes to pass
[1:30:37] like a seed that is planted in water it
[1:30:39] comes to full harvest serving its
[1:30:41] purpose
[1:30:45] now
[1:30:47] what a sacred responsibility then we
[1:30:50] find that we have too much is given much
[1:30:52] is required
[1:30:54] you'll never hear this message and be
[1:30:56] the same come on right that's right you
[1:30:58] don't want to be the same is that right
[1:31:00] you want to grow in maturity and
[1:31:03] in the grace and the and the knowledge
[1:31:06] of the lord jesus amen
[1:31:08] truth
[1:31:10] you want him to become all in all right
[1:31:13] i remember seeing some kind of an old
[1:31:15] horror movie where that somebody from
[1:31:17] another planet come and they planted
[1:31:20] seeds
[1:31:21] you know and then that seed would be
[1:31:23] planted in your closet or something then
[1:31:24] it would take over your being and then
[1:31:26] you would die and that seed would live
[1:31:29] and they'd take over the planet like
[1:31:30] that
[1:31:31] well that was just a figment of
[1:31:33] somebody's imagination but hey we got
[1:31:35] the word of god
[1:31:36] and you got to die so christ can live
[1:31:39] amen think about it amen until you die
[1:31:41] he can't live right that old nature has
[1:31:44] to die all right
[1:31:46] and then it's christ paul said it's no
[1:31:48] longer either living come on
[1:31:55] in the message how can i overcome lord
[1:31:58] lord mercy in john baptist time in john
[1:32:02] the baptist time he's talking about that
[1:32:03] particular generation right you know
[1:32:06] coming up before jesus you know john the
[1:32:08] baptist time
[1:32:10] john introduced jesus but in john the
[1:32:12] baptist time
[1:32:14] there was found six
[1:32:17] that had overcome
[1:32:19] all ages have had their overcomers
[1:32:21] now remember the promise is only to the
[1:32:24] overcomer
[1:32:27] even in the message to the lotus since
[1:32:29] he that overcometh right will i grant to
[1:32:31] sit with me in my throne amen
[1:32:34] even as i have overcome and i'm set down
[1:32:37] with my father in his domain
[1:32:41] throne
[1:32:42] dominion
[1:32:44] his dominion reaches from eternity to
[1:32:46] eternity that's right that's where we're
[1:32:48] promised to sit
[1:32:49] right with him
[1:32:51] now think about it
[1:32:53] overcomers that's right each age has had
[1:32:56] their overcomers six had overcome in
[1:32:59] john the baptist day
[1:33:01] uh all ages had overcomers in john's
[1:33:03] time they had six and that was joseph
[1:33:06] and mary
[1:33:08] zachariah elizabeth simeon and anne
[1:33:12] right right
[1:33:13] now think of all the thousands of people
[1:33:15] but only six all right that's right
[1:33:18] a man a woman man woman man or woman man
[1:33:21] woman type of christian church christian
[1:33:22] church christian church christian church
[1:33:24] see
[1:33:25] notes it starts from the natural man
[1:33:28] joseph the natural man what was he a
[1:33:30] carpenter
[1:33:32] then the priest what was he saying a
[1:33:35] minister in the house of the lord
[1:33:38] zacharias yeah right
[1:33:40] and from that to simeon
[1:33:42] a prophet and a prophetess right
[1:33:46] and then he goes on to say see
[1:33:48] justification baptism the holy ghost
[1:33:50] amen don't you see it
[1:33:52] perfectly six amen
[1:33:54] all the rest of them
[1:33:56] they offered their sacrifice and
[1:33:58] everything
[1:33:59] but these were the elected rights these
[1:34:03] were
[1:34:04] elected
[1:34:06] they overcome
[1:34:08] now as we study the life then um just
[1:34:12] for a few moments this morning of joseph
[1:34:15] and mary zachary and elizabeth and see
[1:34:17] me in an ann okay
[1:34:19] we might have to carry this into the
[1:34:21] evening service but we'll just take it
[1:34:24] so far and then we can come back and
[1:34:25] pick it up because there's a lot in here
[1:34:28] that's really really good
[1:34:30] i want you to notice particularly
[1:34:32] the life of mary
[1:34:35] since we're dealing with her
[1:34:38] coming and
[1:34:39] uh
[1:34:40] having first been given the word right
[1:34:42] and the responsibility of bringing that
[1:34:45] word to maturity right and again now
[1:34:47] she's a type of you amen
[1:34:50] right
[1:34:51] exactly they think that in your heart
[1:34:52] not believe that you see
[1:34:54] mary was the type of you the word is in
[1:34:56] you
[1:34:58] amen as it was in mary amen hey
[1:35:00] you got to put yourself in there okay
[1:35:03] now
[1:35:07] bless it
[1:35:12] look at mary
[1:35:14] she
[1:35:15] could have said bless god i've heard
[1:35:17] from the angel messenger of the hour
[1:35:20] he gave me a personal
[1:35:21] vindication
[1:35:22] and i believe his word free and i know
[1:35:26] that i am going to bring forth the
[1:35:27] messiah
[1:35:29] but you know what she had to do that's
[1:35:31] right
[1:35:33] that word would have corrupted in her
[1:35:34] womb amen she had been stoned right had
[1:35:38] she not come under the headship of her
[1:35:40] christ
[1:35:42] her christ for that name that's right oh
[1:35:45] what right murray a type of
[1:35:49] the church joseph a type of christ
[1:35:52] but by coming under the handship of
[1:35:54] joseph properly
[1:35:56] all right right
[1:35:59] and then following under that handshape
[1:36:01] i'm talking about the headship of the
[1:36:02] word amen
[1:36:05] glory i'm talking about proper headship
[1:36:07] in the church
[1:36:08] right by her being submissive
[1:36:13] right that's it
[1:36:15] brother wait you wouldn't be worth a
[1:36:16] plug nickel
[1:36:22] if you wasn't willing just obey what
[1:36:24] daddy said
[1:36:25] humble yourself
[1:36:27] to me that's what's greatness right
[1:36:29] right see just y'all
[1:36:31] don't see how big it can be see how
[1:36:33] little it can be
[1:36:34] see how humble you can be
[1:36:36] that's
[1:36:41] oh my
[1:36:42] and we wouldn't be worth the thing
[1:36:44] unless we could come under the handshape
[1:36:46] of christ
[1:36:47] right i better not ask for a show of
[1:36:49] hands
[1:36:51] but i i'll ask
[1:36:53] anyway don't lift up your hand you might
[1:36:54] offend your wife but how many of you
[1:36:56] brothers would like for your wives to be
[1:36:58] just a little bit more subjective under
[1:37:00] your headship
[1:37:01] yes a little more respectful a little
[1:37:03] bit more you know loving
[1:37:09] well you know i got the remedy i got the
[1:37:11] formula she's there you
[1:37:14] set an example by coming under your
[1:37:16] hands of christ
[1:37:20] to him and you'll create an atmosphere
[1:37:23] and she'll want to follow you you're
[1:37:24] gonna have such love and fellowship but
[1:37:27] oh my when you're having it with the
[1:37:28] lord and she'll just say i will
[1:37:30] parliament
[1:37:31] i want a father right along with that
[1:37:33] oh at his right hand
[1:37:36] in his presence is the fullness of joy
[1:37:38] in his right hand play that pleasure
[1:37:39] forevermore
[1:37:42] i want to be among those elected i want
[1:37:43] to be an overcomer don't you
[1:37:45] i want to see that word come to full
[1:37:47] maturity in my life
[1:37:49] she come under the headship of joseph
[1:37:52] and then joseph
[1:37:54] under the headship of the leadership of
[1:37:56] the lord right saved by taking the
[1:37:59] christ child down into egypt remember
[1:38:01] saved from herod so the word wouldn't be
[1:38:03] corrupted so the word could come to
[1:38:05] mature teeth right glory the word's
[1:38:07] still in the womb of mary
[1:38:09] at that point
[1:38:11] but
[1:38:13] well it had been birthed at that point
[1:38:15] i'm sorry uh and then just a young child
[1:38:18] a young babe and then took down into
[1:38:20] egypt to fulfill the scripture i called
[1:38:22] my son out of egypt
[1:38:24] see god's working
[1:38:26] all of this has to be his leading right
[1:38:29] see we can't figure it out we have to
[1:38:31] just follow the leadership of the holy
[1:38:32] spirit
[1:38:35] now
[1:38:37] let's just follow the life of mary we
[1:38:39] won't have time to go into all these
[1:38:40] details
[1:38:41] but we see
[1:38:42] then murray one time had this word seed
[1:38:46] in her yeah
[1:38:48] but then she gave birth to this word
[1:38:50] scene and she's holding it now in her
[1:38:52] arms right
[1:38:54] and then as that word begin to mature
[1:39:00] she had the word by her side
[1:39:04] and at the age
[1:39:06] of about 12 years of age she left the
[1:39:09] word right well wait a minute i thought
[1:39:11] you said she was the elect
[1:39:14] i just read it to you
[1:39:16] i thought you said joseph was elect he
[1:39:18] left the word too
[1:39:21] what's that tell me
[1:39:22] elected ones can leave the word yes
[1:39:25] you're right
[1:39:26] but they'll humble themselves and come
[1:39:28] back
[1:39:31] right do you know the elect can
[1:39:33] temporarily maybe be deceived a little
[1:39:35] bit
[1:39:36] get out of step a little bit come on bro
[1:39:38] oh the prophet seen the bride passionate
[1:39:41] review and some in the back was getting
[1:39:42] out of step
[1:39:43] she was the bride and he said get back
[1:39:46] to the staff get back and stuff
[1:39:49] don't you get so holy and righteous that
[1:39:51] you don't think you can miss a step or
[1:39:53] two
[1:39:55] we get this attitude blessed god i'm
[1:39:57] predestinated i heard the message for
[1:39:59] myself i don't need nobody to tell me
[1:40:02] anything all i have to do is turn on the
[1:40:04] tape
[1:40:06] i heard the angel myself right oh my
[1:40:09] that don't do weight the five-fold
[1:40:10] ministry
[1:40:12] that's right after the seals was open
[1:40:14] that didn't do with the five-fold
[1:40:16] ministry
[1:40:17] in fact question answers on the seals
[1:40:19] brother brown will the bride have a
[1:40:22] a a ministry before the before the
[1:40:25] coming of the lord before the rapture

[1:40:31] he said it's going on right now
[1:40:33] and it consists of apostles prophets
[1:40:35] evangelists pastors and teachers but
[1:40:36] it'll be so humble
[1:40:42] the prophet also said see what i mean
[1:40:45] you've got to come under
[1:40:46] he said every individual ought to have a
[1:40:48] church home someplace where you go and
[1:40:50] support the cause pay your tithes and
[1:40:52] offerings and so forth and you call it
[1:40:54] your church right you need that

[1:41:05] the best in the land but don't
[1:41:06] dis-fellowship the other fella then
[1:41:09] is that right treat them as brothers
[1:41:13] oh
[1:41:14] yes just because

[1:41:17] idea that people
[1:41:19] and i'll have to say i i've kind of you
[1:41:20] know

[1:41:23] a little inclined that way myself in
[1:41:24] time past
[1:41:25] blessing bless god
[1:41:28] we think lest they come to our church
[1:41:29] they just can't be saved
[1:41:33] but the prophet himself said you don't
[1:41:36] have to come to the branham tabernacle
[1:41:38] to be saved and he was no hypocrite come
[1:41:41] on brother amen what he said
[1:41:44] he knew that there was a universal bride
[1:41:48] amen you get this attitude they got to
[1:41:50] come to europe oh
[1:41:52] come on
[1:41:53] something wrong somewhere we need to

[1:42:21] you know what i mean
[1:42:22] give me your undivided attention help me
[1:42:24] preach this you know what preaching's
[1:42:26] like pulling two-man
[1:42:27] off right
[1:42:28] takes two to do it all right if the saw
[1:42:30] is sharp it'll cut
[1:42:32] it's not the third push it's the third
[1:42:34] pull right
[1:42:37] how many ever pulled the two man
[1:42:38] crosscut saw man oh got a few okay my
[1:42:42] older brothers would say don't ride that
[1:42:44] thing if you're gonna ride it get a side
[1:42:46] saddle
[1:42:48] you know
[1:42:49] if they start working me too hard too
[1:42:51] fast i just bear down on a little bit
[1:42:52] you know that slow them down a little
[1:42:54] bit he might be stronger than me but if
[1:42:57] i put no pressure on that right amen but
[1:43:00] don't sit down on me now don't try to
[1:43:02] ride just just pull them
[1:43:03] let it glide let me cut okay
[1:43:09] she left the word but she came back to
[1:43:11] the word right
[1:43:14] she denied the supernatural birth of the
[1:43:16] word like the pentecostals today
[1:43:18] malachi 4 according malachi 4 the full
[1:43:20] word that was to be birthed back into
[1:43:22] full manifestation again today as it was
[1:43:25] 2 000 years ago
[1:43:27] in full power and full manifestation you
[1:43:29] believe he's here
[1:43:32] but the pentecostals couldn't believe
[1:43:34] that they denied the supernatural birth
[1:43:35] of the word in our day like murray did
[1:43:37] in that day but the word corrected the
[1:43:39] era right right that's it
[1:43:42] and the word creek's here today
[1:43:46] no it's down i must be about my father's
[1:43:48] business
[1:43:49] not making cabinets in the carpenter
[1:43:51] shop
[1:43:52] right but having a minister's name
[1:43:58] yeah minister's meeting had been going
[1:44:00] on for about three days and three nights
[1:44:02] after three days they found him right
[1:44:03] where they left him
[1:44:05] correcting the denominational errors in
[1:44:07] those preachers
[1:44:10] that's the father's business the word
[1:44:11] will creek there
[1:44:15] sure
[1:44:16] both answering their questions and
[1:44:17] asking them questions right
[1:44:19] so we find out ministers meetings is
[1:44:21] scriptural right
[1:44:23] brother brown done it
[1:44:24] and he told us to do it right oh i don't
[1:44:27] like the way they they argue a little
[1:44:29] bit or fuss a little bit well they might
[1:44:30] argue and fuss in church but you still
[1:44:32] got to go to church
[1:44:46] i don't want to stir up with myself
[1:44:49] just so he'd have a little activity
[1:44:54] but see there
[1:44:57] he became subject to them
[1:44:59] even though there was an era
[1:45:01] he rose up and came subject to him and
[1:45:02] went with him
[1:45:04] even though she denied him right there
[1:45:06] all the grace of god
[1:45:08] the grace of god denied the supernatural
[1:45:10] birth word and god still reaching out
[1:45:12] and he became and grew then
[1:45:14] in stature and in the sight of god and
[1:45:16] man right in fact
[1:45:18] come in the word coming to maturity see
[1:45:20] how humility brings it to what if he had
[1:45:22] just said well you all going to act like
[1:45:24] this don't you know who i am
[1:45:26] he was beginning to see who he was jesus
[1:45:33] said that he had to find his place in
[1:45:34] the word of god amen
[1:45:36] come on brother bar mitzvah 12 years old
[1:45:40] see he was coming to maturity
[1:45:44] oh my see
[1:45:46] revelation breaking all right
[1:45:51] he's realizing he's the passover lamb at
[1:45:54] the feast of passover
[1:45:55] and they had left him but they came back
[1:45:58] and he went with them then that's right
[1:46:00] now look they bring that word to
[1:46:01] maturity coming on down and here then
[1:46:04] that word that she one time corrected is
[1:46:07] correcting her right
[1:46:09] amen
[1:46:10] right mama correct and and daddy correct
[1:46:12] and
[1:46:13] little jesus all along now
[1:46:17] amen hey he's having to correct them
[1:46:20] that's right right
[1:46:22] amen can you stand correct
[1:46:25] as many as i love that's a good sign of
[1:46:27] god's love to you if you get a little
[1:46:29] whipping what's the water
[1:46:31] man is i love all right
[1:46:34] oh i thank god for ever licking him i
[1:46:36] needed every one of them
[1:46:41] i ain't got time to talk about my old
[1:46:42] made school teacher
[1:46:44] boy i needed every one of them
[1:46:50] but see now watch mary now here
[1:46:53] she is
[1:46:55] following right on with the lord
[1:46:57] and trying to stay as close to him as he
[1:46:59] can but he's got a ministry he's got to
[1:47:00] fulfill
[1:47:01] and he's out here and he
[1:47:03] she and
[1:47:04] and her jesus had brothers or foster
[1:47:08] brothers however you won't say it they
[1:47:09] went down to visit the meeting come on
[1:47:11] and uh
[1:47:13] word come to jesus your mother and your
[1:47:15] bro who is my mother
[1:47:18] they that do the will of my father the
[1:47:20] same right
[1:47:22] now he wasn't denying her in any way but
[1:47:24] he's pulling her up a little closer soon
[1:47:25] come on amen making her realize you know
[1:47:28] what well i've got a ministry i've got a
[1:47:30] ministry to take care of here
[1:47:31] and so forth and and so then we see how
[1:47:35] that at the cross here was mary
[1:47:38] following him right up to the cross
[1:47:40] right that's the bride of christ murray
[1:47:42] type of the bride
[1:47:44] right to calvary here she was and john
[1:47:48] a type of the bride in every age
[1:47:50] the raptured church the bride john john
[1:47:53] the beloved also attack here he is at
[1:47:55] the cross
[1:47:58] right you got to go to calgary folks
[1:48:00] can't bypass calvary if there's no death
[1:48:03] there'll be no resurrection
[1:48:05] amen and so here they are and jesus the
[1:48:08] word speaking to them and said now
[1:48:11] son behold thy mother amen mother behold
[1:48:14] thy son pointing to john right his
[1:48:18] earthly headship was going to be removed
[1:48:20] and john's got to fulfill that handshape
[1:48:22] and his absence right
[1:48:23] so jesus had been under the handship of
[1:48:26] mary
[1:48:27] joseph had probably passed on at that
[1:48:29] time because you don't see him at the
[1:48:30] cross i believe he'd have been there
[1:48:32] because he was one of the elected
[1:48:33] but you know he was in his 40s whenever
[1:48:36] he married mary
[1:48:38] and by this time 50 60 70 maybe
[1:48:41] something like that you know in his 70s
[1:48:44] and we don't see him no more right but
[1:48:46] here's mary and john and jesus puts mary
[1:48:50] under the headship of john
[1:48:52] jesus taught headship
[1:48:55] and you know what mary done the bible
[1:48:57] says and she went to the home of john
[1:48:58] from then on stay with john exactly
[1:49:02] maybe she's a wit at that point
[1:49:04] i want you to watch the life of mary a
[1:49:05] little bit here
[1:49:10] at this point
[1:49:12] 33 and say 18 is what
[1:49:16] that's about how old she was
[1:49:18] some of you mathematicians tell me how
[1:49:20] old she was
[1:49:24] all right mary's probably about 50 years
[1:49:26] old let's say at calvary
[1:49:29] in her 50s
[1:49:31] all right
[1:49:32] now
[1:49:33] she's put under the perhaps a widow
[1:49:36] under the headship
[1:49:38] of an apostle which later become and
[1:49:40] manifested as a pastor
[1:49:43] i said john became a pastor
[1:49:46] in fact he pastored the greatest church
[1:49:48] in that day
[1:49:50] how many knows that
[1:49:51] glory
[1:49:53] sure mary under the headship of a pastor
[1:49:55] and you know where that pastor led her
[1:49:58] right to the upper room right
[1:50:00] and that word that one time had been in
[1:50:02] her womb
[1:50:04] that word that one time had been by her
[1:50:06] side right
[1:50:08] that word that nursed and raised up
[1:50:10] now has to be in her heart all right
[1:50:13] that's right
[1:50:14] same word he is now with you but shall
[1:50:16] be in you right see right john pastor
[1:50:20] john bringing her to the upper room
[1:50:22] getting her under the headship of the
[1:50:24] word getting the holy ghost to headship
[1:50:26] insider right nothing
[1:50:28] under the headship but the heads up in
[1:50:31] you
[1:50:32] and you're in the handshake that's right
[1:50:35] amen

[1:50:39] sisters
[1:50:40] are in
[1:50:41] god's own godhead brother brown said
[1:50:43] that right
[1:50:44] what yeah
[1:50:46] in there if you're in there that's right
[1:50:49] part of god's own godhead amen he's now
[1:50:51] complete without every member that's
[1:50:52] right
[1:50:54] god's not complete without you right
[1:50:56] that's right is that true nobody can
[1:50:58] take your place
[1:51:00] now listen
[1:51:01] and the manifestation of his spirit
[1:51:03] cannot be manifested and
[1:51:06] without you being made manifest that's
[1:51:08] right the word must come to maturity and
[1:51:10] manifest that thought that he had if you
[1:51:12] in this generation you are that portion
[1:51:14] of the word god that's been allocated
[1:51:16] this generation and that word must come
[1:51:17] to full
[1:51:18] manifestation full maturity and
[1:51:20] manifestation
[1:51:21] see what i'm saying
[1:51:23] sons and daughters
[1:51:26] the family of god
[1:51:28] oh i'm so glad i'm first all the family
[1:51:31] are gone

[1:51:47] and we see her
[1:51:48] still under the headship of pastor john
[1:51:52] way over in ephesus right yeah
[1:51:56] it might have been driven out of
[1:51:57] jerusalem under persecution i don't know
[1:52:00] but here they we're scattering the word
[1:52:02] of god brother said that was exactly the
[1:52:03] will of god exactly right amen
[1:52:08] jerusalem judea and the uttermost
[1:52:11] and here john the
[1:52:14] you know brother brown said it's
[1:52:15] possible for a man to have more than one
[1:52:16] gift of these of these gifts of even the
[1:52:19] fivefold ministry gifts
[1:52:21] here is the disciple and apostle john
[1:52:25] who done the work of a missionary also
[1:52:27] by the way
[1:52:28] and here he is now over here doing a
[1:52:30] pastor's work
[1:52:31] and murray is subject with him still yet
[1:52:34] under the headship of the pastor all
[1:52:36] right and you know what they're doing
[1:52:37] over there
[1:52:38] they're compiling
[1:52:40] now look
[1:52:41] they're in jerusalem she was part of
[1:52:42] this bribery ministry see
[1:52:45] but by 50 a.d
[1:52:47] or 52 a.d
[1:52:49] that this bride tree say which was
[1:52:51] mostly jewish has starting to fall away
[1:52:55] but god brought paul on the scene amen
[1:52:57] right
[1:52:58] that first church angel messenger
[1:53:00] oh
[1:53:01] brother
[1:53:03] after my departure grievous will come in
[1:53:05] but when he was there brother he lined
[1:53:07] it out didn't he at first church angel
[1:53:09] messenger establishing the church at
[1:53:12] ephesus
[1:53:13] and here john went over there led by the
[1:53:15] spirit
[1:53:16] and pastored that church and mary lived
[1:53:19] by the spirit right there with him you
[1:53:20] know what this is doing that is
[1:53:22] compiling
[1:53:24] the gospels matthew mark luke and john
[1:53:26] and the epistles of paul
[1:53:29] and peter
[1:53:31] and james and there's put them in canon
[1:53:33] form in the bible they were compiling
[1:53:36] the word of god
[1:53:38] and that's exactly why john was banished
[1:53:41] to the owl of tecmus right right because
[1:53:43] the government didn't want it done
[1:53:45] in satan's eden he didn't lack that word
[1:53:47] of god being coming to maturity and
[1:53:50] being established
[1:54:05] see the maturing of the word amen oh
[1:54:07] it's beautiful beautiful
[1:54:11] now
[1:54:12] it was about 90. i've got the quote
[1:54:14] right here
[1:54:15] 90 a.d
[1:54:18] how was mary then
[1:54:19] when john was banished to alpacas
[1:54:22] that would have been uh
[1:54:24] at 33 she was in her 50s
[1:54:26] and now
[1:54:28] uh 60 years later
[1:54:30] is that right 33 to 93 would be 60 years
[1:54:35] mary's getting pretty old right
[1:54:37] how has she been approximately
[1:54:42] 93
[1:54:47] if she was 53 now this is sunday school
[1:54:50] lesson it's okay
[1:54:53] we could put it on the board here but
[1:54:55] let's say
[1:54:56] now uh
[1:54:58] let's just give her give her the benefit
[1:55:00] out let's say she was 18.
[1:55:02] brother man said 16 or 18.
[1:55:04] let's just say she was 18 years old
[1:55:06] um whenever joseph and her got married
[1:55:10] before they got married now they were
[1:55:11] engaged and she was conceived see with
[1:55:14] the with the christ child in fact the
[1:55:16] first three months of her conception she
[1:55:18] wasn't even around joseph at all right
[1:55:21] for that first three months of her
[1:55:22] conception
[1:55:24] she was way over here with elizabeth
[1:55:26] having a fellowship meeting
[1:55:28] and you know what she had in her womb
[1:55:30] jesus amen and you know what lesbian had
[1:55:32] in her will
[1:55:33] another overcomer
[1:55:35] there was god in the prophet
[1:55:37] talked about a fellowship and they're
[1:55:39] hugging one another's neck oh my brother
[1:55:42] think about that now we're men and they
[1:55:45] were women
[1:55:46] but here is two women
[1:55:48] hugging and embracing one another and
[1:55:51] here's
[1:55:52] god is the prophet right here
[1:55:54] talking about the holy ghost
[1:55:57] talk about and you know as soon as
[1:55:59] murray come in and and gave her
[1:56:01] salutation she mentioned the name jesus
[1:56:04] and murray see the baby had been dead
[1:56:06] for about about six months right hadn't
[1:56:09] moved you know that's unusual any mother
[1:56:11] that knows that you've had children if
[1:56:13] that you don't have any movement
[1:56:16] sometimes my wife has felt the movement
[1:56:18] as early as three months
[1:56:21] but see here was john dead
[1:56:24] the prophet dead right
[1:56:41] really mentioned to murray but murray
[1:56:42] had never breathed it
[1:56:44] immediately as soon as she got the
[1:56:45] message she went to elizabeth and the
[1:56:47] first time she breathed it
[1:56:52] oh my speaking of the word of the name
[1:56:55] of the lord jesus and a dead baby come
[1:56:58] to life
[1:56:59] in the will of an overcomer
[1:57:02] my and
[1:57:03] and john was filled with the holy ghost
[1:57:05] from his mother's womb right then
[1:57:09] my think about it
[1:57:10] another three months is all she he had
[1:57:12] to be in there then see
[1:57:14] and about the time for elizabeth to
[1:57:16] deliver mary leaves
[1:57:18] yeah and when she gets back there she's
[1:57:20] three months along yeah

[1:57:24] i don't know but joseph you know
[1:57:27] he want he won't know what's going on
[1:57:30] where you been
[1:57:32] is that right
[1:57:33] and god had revealed to him that it was
[1:57:35] a word coming to maturity
[1:57:43] are you willing to bear the reproach of
[1:57:44] letting the word come to maturity in you
[1:57:46] talk about a reproach for the word's
[1:57:49] sake that's right
[1:57:50] think about the reproach mary had bar uh
[1:57:52] uh

[1:58:11] righteousness amen amen amen
[1:58:15] oh my god

[1:58:29] call you
[1:58:31] are you willing to bear the reproach are
[1:58:34] you afraid to testify that you're
[1:58:36] impregnated
[1:58:39] brother said the bride's already
[1:58:41] pregnanted amen
