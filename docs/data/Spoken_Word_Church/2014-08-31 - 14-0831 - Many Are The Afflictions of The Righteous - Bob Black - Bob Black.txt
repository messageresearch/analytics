========================================

all right so what i want to do is read the whole chapter of psalm 34 and kind of narrow down on verse 19 okay um before we do that let's go to the lord in prayer thank you lord god for your grace to us and for another day to serve you lord jesus i pray god that you'll be with the way in june and all the ones that can't be here today lord jesus bless the service this morning lord grant the lord that you'll open our hearts with jesus and give us things we have needed when we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ now the reason uh for those that are listening in we just read first samuel 19 through um i was planning to read through like 21. and the reason of that is kind of to talk about um we'll get to that in a second let's just read psalm 34 uh i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth and you can see here that we didn't really get to this story in our reading the story of how uh david changed his behavior before big elect which you can see this this little note here in psalm 34 this psalm was kind of written around the time when right after that little period in first samuel they were reading all these things were happening in david's life um he's getting chased by saul he uh runs away to uh the house of the lord where he's given the showbread and he runs over to the uh it goes through all these different experiences where he's being chased by people and i i think this song david kind of wrote songs as he was going through life you know um that you can uh there's a song of david in first samuel 22 that he wrote right after he uh was delivered from saul and then there's that kind of starts off his life and there's a another song that he wrote more towards the end of his life and first samuel 23. and that's that'd be a good little exercise to read just kind of how david through his life he you can kind of see how he changed and um so that's what i want to talk about this morning is how how does god change us and we know you know by the way he's been bringing us through the statute of perfect man and how god uh changes us through the opening of the word and things and and there's many tools in god's arsenal and one of them is is affliction and suffering and a lot of times we'll think well why is god bringing suffering and things on why are we going through these things but all down through the all over the bible god uh every one of god's people has had to go through periods where things happen that seem out of the how you know why why if i'm serving god if i'm doing what's right why are these things happening why am i going through this period where it seems like a low a real low value why are there valleys and it's all part of god's plan it's all part of his purpose so maybe as david was writing this little song he was thinking about all the things that he had gone through and how god had delivered him and then we'll get down to verse 19 and which is what we'll focus on real quick i'm gonna try to kind of make wise use of the time uh verse two my soul shall make her boast and the lord they own shall hear thereof and be glad i'll magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears now that's good because no matter what the devil brought no matter what temptations and trials god was still there to deliver him of his fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord and encampeth round about them that fear him and deliver them the only way you can really know that the angel of the lord is camping around is that you've got a personal experience where you have uh it's one thing to talk about it but it's another to have lived through experiences just like david and job and all these men of the bible that paul that have gone through low valleys you can't have a testimony without a test you got to have something in your life that happens where you think well something's going to have to happen god's got to do something for me before you can have a testimony o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him no fear the lord and his saints for there is no want to them that fear him young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing come you children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord now that's that's a good scripture you know one scripture that really sticks with me is over there in genesis chapter 18 and we know the whole story of uh how abraham walked through the kind of the journey of a believer but they're in genesis at 18 i think it's verse 19 through 21 god kind of just tells him the reason i'm telling you all these mysteries the reason why i chose you because i knew that you would teach your children and you know it goes all the way back to the garden of eden spiritual multiplication the whole point of of the plan to god to multiply himself and put himself in people and and now we're doing that by uh teaching sharing one another sharing the gospel and how can how could abraham be the father of nations without without teaching his children but you know natural and spiritual you can't that's that's the way the gospel spreads is by teaching and how important that is what man is he that desireth life and love with many days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil in our lips from speaking god depart from evil and to do and do good seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open under their cry the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles now there's a there's a good statement that we believe that because you know sometimes the lord will send things but let things come upon you just as a you know as a test to see if you really believe his word to see and i believe many times to to expose to you that you really believe it after you come through these trials and things that you can look back and say wow i really do believe god the lord is nine to them that are of a broken heart and saviors such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken evil shall slay the wicked and they that he the righteous shall be desolate the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate now if you look at this scripture which you just have to look at in your bible we don't have it up here but this is kind of two parts many other afflictions of the righteous and i i i you know i read what i got this book by saint thomas aquinas that he a lot of uh a lot of people kind of put so much focus on suffering like he did that you almost uh he almost kind of you gotta balance it out because suffering by itself doesn't bring character you gotta have the opposite of this the other part of the equation the lord god brings them out of them all right now that's what differentiates because when i go to work every day i see the plenty of people that are going through suffering sitting on the side of the road begging people on the train that are so drugged up you know that they can't even sit up and and people police escorting people off the train that have used the bathroom on themselves and all kinds of horrible things that you'd say well they're going through horrible afflictions and and people at work that are so wrapped up in the sin of the world and different things all around i remember when i was a real young person i remember hearing one of my friends talking about his older brother and he said well he said when i i go to work and i i come home and i drink a beer and i go to bed and i get up next morning i just do it all over again well that's that's affliction you know you're an affliction of sin affliction that sounds so it's you know the bible says the timing has happened to all me and every it's not a uh uncommon thing for you to get a flat tire or go through things that are just part of life problems of life and things but what's different about a christian is that we've got something to relieve the pressure y'all excuse me a second because brother ryan preached that he preached that letting off pressure like five or six times and he talks about how the the things of the world will just heap up on you and yes lord yes you get all this um you know what affliction is is suffering and distress i just wrote some new stuff pain trouble misery hardship misfortune adversity sorrow torment tribulation woe and and all these things come upon people uh but but their god pays this is like a tool in his arsenal to to use to to cause to prod as a believer to cause us to move closer to him to build our character and move to to to draw us to to put us more in fellowship with him and you know hebrews 12 5 he says now you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not they are the chastening of the lord nor faith when thou i repeat to him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god deal dealth with you as with sons for what son has even the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons well that's in other words is every single child of god has got to come through chastisement through you say well i haven't done anything wrong you know i'm living i'm living as close to god as i can like job who said that who god said there ain't there ain't nobody in the world like joe nobody on the whole planet that's living as faithful as job is this man stands alone and here comes the devil says prove it right i can i can change the circumstance and make him just believe you but yet god jokes stood true and it didn't matter what the circumstance was his faith healed strong and and that's what i thought it makes makes you get emotional that's what a lot of times god will will let things come upon you to see what you're going to do to make manifest his word in you because let's say let's say that you have matured up the statue of a perfect man and all these virtues are in you now let's see it prove it maybe the devil will say this yeah that's uh or god will uh allow an evil spirit to go give you a little trial bring you down a little bit take something that you hold dearly away from you and see what you're gonna do see see what you're really made of and i just kind of wrote a little list of all the people that have suffered affliction you know in hebrews 11 it's written that moses counted the affliction of god as as greater than the all the traitors in egypt and he made a choice that he would rather have the affliction of god than to have all the gold all the power he turned all of that down and you know you know the whole story about how it all really started the prodding that golden of god started when he was a little child sitting on his mama knee hit his mom's knee as his mama was telling you're not really one of these egyptian people i'll tell you where you really came from you you're you're you've got a different birth you've got your uh you're just special child and and whatnot and and that's what what god i'm gonna jump ahead what god does is he'll he'll go he'll go just like he go to paul he said why are you kick against kick against the pricks when that pillar of fire appeared before paul now kicking against the priests there's a scripture in deuteronomy where it says a speaking of israel just your room you're you've gotten fat and you're kicking and i'm just paraphrasing because i don't have it written down but in other words israel had gotten all big and every time the word of the lord came out they an ox code is like this big stick and they would they would steer they would nudge the ox along to go one way or the other with this oxygen with a big iron point on the end so imagine god nudging israel along they just got so fat and lazy you know they just don't care anymore and and god's problem along and they they're kicked like an ox kicking back and and uh and that's what god told paul why i'm trying to get you to go in the direction that i want you to go why are you kicking against the pricks and you know the pricks the pricks about god's occurred is his word when he was there standing and he saw stephen the life of god made manifest when he saw the life of god the same life that was in christ may manifest as stephen you know something prickly in his heart and that was like something is different about this i've never seen anything like this before and then that pillar of fire appeared before him and he said and hey god told him you're i'm trying to steer you in a particular direction but you're not listening to my to my call ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 11 says the words of the wise are as goods and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd the words of the wise now who's got wisdom who's got wisdom in this day but the the holy ghost feel a believer that's where real wisdom wisdom only comes from god wisdom on it you only find today you only find wisdom in the message listening to the tapes listening to somebody that knows what they're talking about yes and those words of wisdom are like goats that's why i i've been kind of thinking all this why why do we get now when when the real words of wisdom come forth when you listen to a tape or listening to it sitting in church why do we get offended a lot of times well the reason is that i believe is because we wrap our ideas we wrap ourselves around these little ideas that we've held for so long that we believe that we've got these little ideas and things that we we we're pretty sure this is right whether it's about something small or something great something uh we've got these little ideas about god's word and when god's word comes across the pulpit or comes from the tape because his word is sharper than a two-inch sword going all the way down to the mirror of the bone what's in the mirror that that's where the the blood is made right in the mirror of the bone that's where the life is right so when that sword of god's word goes all the way down and says well i'll see what's down here then you got you're all wrapped up in your own little ideas and you say well i i oh that hurts that hurt i i had this little idea about the way that was supposed to work i had this idea about how how i was supposed to conduct myself or whatever and that and that hurts and it causes offense of course you know there's lots of different offenses there's the the bible says that uh lord of them who by whom offenses come and that's that's speaking of a different offense it's offensive when it was offensive when jesus was hung on the tree that was in the fields offense when when peter was hung upside down that was offensive but and as we can also be offended when the word of god comes forth in wisdom and we need to watch that out because the words of the wise are his goats trying to steer us into the right path and the right path is the purpose the end goal is to get us into the image of god and that's what all this is doing is god's using this as a tool in his arsenal to move us in the direction he'll give us he'll send us little trials and tribulations and things and you've got to have trials you've got to have those experiences where it seems like all your friends have turned away it seems like maybe everybody at church doesn't really care anymore it seems like everything nothing is going right but you know all those little things are just orchestrated perfectly by god to make you turn to him because there's nobody you can depend on like god there's no friend like him and when you when he becomes your friend which is his goal that's what his his purpose is for you to have a personal relationship with him so that he can make himself manifest in you that's right then everything else that then all the pressure is let off it lets off all the pressure who cares who cares what anybody says about you who cares when uh you know men are avail you or or say things against you because you've got him as well and that's the main thing and now brother brown taught i got like just a few minutes then brother brown talked about how that when you get the new birth and we know all we've heard this for over and over that when the when you get the new birth the devil all those guns are turned at you and you know the new birth that's what i always tell my kids the new birth does not make you a robot christian that immediately you all you're going to do is just to i believe you know you're still like brother said even ministers have to watch out for that because we'll start uh you know he said we're not made of stuff sawdust we're flesh and blood that's right and we i we gotta watch that because you will start thinking why are people you know why why are people not living like a robot like do it just you know moving along just perfect in alignment just doing everything perfectly because we we've all got mistakes we've all got little problems that we struggle with and and it it behooves us to bear with one another and and be patient and long-suffering because we all have problems we've all well that's what we're all we're all going through this this struggle of life to complete the race to get to the end yes and we've all got that one goal in mind that's right so let's um be patient with one another as we go through the afflictions and trials of life bearing with one another bearing one another's burdens let me hear them that's not bob's time oh no is there all right well we'll see we'll see what time the bell rings so we'll just play it right here now i was listening we were listening to letting off preacher this morning coming to church and and um brother was that was a he made a statement in there about how uh that brother brown unless these things that god lets these things come on you so he could test the building now isn't that so good after all we've heard by the way teach y'all and everything what build is he testing he's testing that building yeah he's testing the scene how it's all sealed together that's right and uh not how it's all sealed again though to to prove to you what god has done for you that you really do have god in this thing right now you have patience all these different things questions uh well he preached he preached it five or six times i think the first time was in 1961 as the one we were listening to um so he's testing that building testing that out just like um zerubbabel with his plumb line which you know he's measuring it up against the word of god to see everything he's just right and that's what he does when he brings these little afflictions and trials and things on you to see do you really believe him like abraham do you really believe that god's going to give you a child now what's that a lamb exactly exactly yes let's just um we just have a few minutes so now here's one we've all heard before is it possible for a holy ghost person to be driven by the driven body to do minor things influenced to do minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir in other words are you gonna have trouble after you get the holy ghost is the devil gonna come after you are you gonna have problems with things or is it gonna are you gonna be a robot christian they don't have no problems the devil just shoots his arrows you know no problems at all you're just walking around impervious to uh everything but you god don't take your free will away you still have the the uh the ability to choose to choose whether to pray to choose whether to read the bible to choose rather so he says yeah a holy ghost field person you're right in the place then to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a target think about that now what a privilege to be a target for the devil now don't take me wrong now you know you don't want to volunteer say devil come at me lord have mercy let's not do that but to be in a place where god you know to have the holy ghost and be trying to do right and because the devil don't they never don't care until until you've got the holy ghost until you're lit trying to do right and trying to live right then you know he's got all his guns on because he's trying to he's trying to uh see what he can do that's right it's a it's a privilege to serve god it's a privilege to be a witness it's a privilege to go into work and be a witness to all the people that uh of what i was reading i think is first timothy where paul told timothy don't worry about you know you won't be a testimony don't worry about uh being i forget how he said it but don't worry about being shy about the gospel trying to encourage him because it's a privilege to carry the gospel it's a privilege to um to bear the approach of the gospel and that's what i mean about um being a target for the devil i hope nobody misinterpreted that and uh in faith and then if you don't just like salvation you accept christ and the first thing you know immediately the devil take how many ears born again let's see your hands praise the lord for that how many was tempted and went through temptation immediately after he was born again let's see your hands every one of you and there's there's a scripture for matthew 4 1. that was jesus led up right after the type of the new birth then with jesus this is the holy spirit descending on him then was jesus led up with the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil so right after that the angel and the commission as things of life don't always come upon you god hasn't sent it just because you've done something wrong not it not every time it's not every time it's like that remember the boys of the gate they said who who sinned he or his father or his mother remember that jesus said in this case neither that the works of god might be known that the works of god might be known now the works of god is that so that you can make manifest what god has done in your life to prove that he's done something to prove that you got temperance that's you know when you got at work and that's what he talked about letting off the pressure that people will come and and uh i always think it's funny when i'm driving into work and there's just traffic for miles all as far as you can see there's traffic and somebody get behind you in one of those little teeny-weeny cars and just kind of you know all that pressure's building up and they just can't always stand it i got in traffic the other day and i got all i got on i was getting on the train and there was somebody in the elevator that she just at the train station and she just couldn't hardly stand it i've been in traffic for two hours i just can't hardly stand it because pressure had built up so much and and that and you know so when the pressure builds up got a little trial come to see if you really got tempers and and prove to you or whether you really got virtue all these different little trial patients patience is do you really believe that god will bring deliverance do you really believe that god will save your children are you patient enough to wait and rest in him knowing that he hears and answered prayers can you can you rest yeah i drive all the time that the thing to do is just go with the floor you have nothing you can do you know you still want to do a car so you know he has you can pray a disease or a situation or for somebody that god would want exactly oh yes yes that's why he was always very careful because sometimes that's a purpose that god is doing when i pray about stuff a lot of times i'll say your will yeah i i don't know from reading that before or something like that before but i do do that now a lot of times he would let sickness come upon people because of sin and then through the discernment he would uncover hidden sin or whatever in their life but remember when when people came to jesus in the new testament when they came to him there's not one recorded evidence i can ever turn anybody away because his desire and that's one of the good things and love by that book by ff bosworth his desire is always to him and and i think um you know if you had some time see what brother ram said about that thorn in the flesh that y'all gave paul it might not be what we think let's let's stop right there can i get a copy of you okay
