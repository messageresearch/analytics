[32:35] children like that
[32:37] and i believe they are they are pillars
[32:40] of this church in future amen and what a
[32:43] blessing it will be
[32:45] amen i would like to speak on
[32:48] our response to the test
[32:51] and
[32:52] i believe
[32:54] the bible speaks that every
[32:56] uh son that cometh to the lord must be
[32:59] proven must be chastised
[33:02] but we look into the story here this
[33:04] evening this afternoon my brothers my
[33:06] sisters
[33:07] uh
[33:08] you know
[33:10] this woman was obito
[33:12] and
[33:14] she just
[33:15] had a handful of meal and maybe a few
[33:18] drops of
[33:19] oil in her cruise
[33:21] and she was at the gate of that city you
[33:25] know
[33:26] uh trying to find some sticks
[33:29] and uh cooked the last meal last cake
[33:32] you know for her and for her son
[33:35] and they were getting ready to die and
[33:38] in this time
[33:39] you know
[33:40] a man comes to her
[33:43] um
[33:44] you know the prophet of god
[33:46] and the lord told him to come to this
[33:49] place
[33:50] and when when he came to that city
[33:53] and he began to talk to this woman
[33:56] and uh
[33:57] he said i'm thirsty can you give me a
[33:59] little water to drink
[34:01] and she turned and she as she was turned
[34:04] as she turned and as you as she was
[34:06] walking to get a little water for him to
[34:08] drink and he began to say you know i'm
[34:11] hungry too
[34:14] and it is quite a test for this woman
[34:17] brother branham says it was quite a test
[34:20] you know quite a trial
[34:22] uh a great trial for her faith and
[34:25] obedience
[34:26] you know she had to
[34:29] exercise her faith and she had to obey
[34:33] what this man has said
[34:35] and this prophet was a stranger to her
[34:37] actually
[34:38] she never saw him she never met him and
[34:42] and you know she had a lot of objections
[34:45] and reasonable objections we could say
[34:49] but you know when he began to talk to
[34:51] this uh this lady this widow she over
[34:54] came all her object objections and uh
[34:58] reasons and uh she had enough reasons to
[35:01] tell him i'm sorry
[35:04] she could have said sir i cannot do that
[35:06] i'm sorry
[35:08] but
[35:09] when the prophet began to speak to her
[35:11] something happened in her heart
[35:13] and he said this man is asking a piece
[35:16] of bread and
[35:17] you know and he's giving me an assurance
[35:20] that
[35:21] you know you go and
[35:23] you know no problem you got marshall of
[35:25] meal and you know few drops of oil in
[35:28] the cruise he said no problem that will
[35:30] be taken care but you go and make the
[35:32] first cake and bring it to me
[35:34] and that was quite a quite a task my
[35:37] brothers my sisters you know you know if
[35:39] we are in that kind of situation i don't
[35:41] know how we will react but thank god
[35:44] that this old widow you know uh i mean i
[35:47] don't mean that she was an old woman but
[35:49] you know uh this this woman you know
[35:52] being widow you know she began to think
[35:55] something positive
[35:56] yeah and i'm so glad that she did it
[36:00] and i believe this is a small lesson to
[36:02] our lives today
[36:04] you know when you listen to the word of
[36:06] god when you hear the word of god
[36:08] and the word of god speak to our hearts
[36:10] and i believe that's the time not only
[36:13] we hear the word of god but we receive
[36:15] it into our hearts
[36:17] and we try to do what the word of god
[36:19] told us to do
[36:21] that shows that we are taking that in a
[36:24] positive way
[36:25] and i believe my brothers my sister this
[36:28] woman you know she overcome her
[36:30] objections and she over you know
[36:33] overcome our reasonings and you know she
[36:36] took this prophet prophet's word and you
[36:39] know like the bible said seek ye first
[36:41] the kingdom of god and and its
[36:43] righteousness and then these all these
[36:45] things shall be added unto you
[36:48] and i believe as a children of god today
[36:50] this afternoon my brothers my sister our
[36:53] priority
[36:54] is seeking first the kingdom of god
[36:58] no matter what our circumstances are no
[37:00] matter what kind of situation we are
[37:02] surrounded by no matter what kind of uh
[37:05] you know difficulties we are going
[37:07] through but our priority in our lives
[37:10] must be jesus christ
[37:12] and if we can do that if we can place
[37:14] jesus if he can place god in number one
[37:17] place and brother you just keep watching
[37:20] what god does in our lives
[37:22] and and you know we are not surprised to
[37:24] see when she obeyed this prophet's word
[37:28] when she took this word of the prophet
[37:30] and she went into her house and she
[37:32] began to you know lit fire and
[37:34] and you know she began to begin to uh
[37:37] prepare a cake for this man of god and
[37:40] and as she was preparing maybe she
[37:42] turned a little back and and something
[37:45] she could
[37:46] feel and something she could see some
[37:48] kind of a special presence of god has
[37:52] come and surrounded her her kitchen and
[37:54] and she sees something different here
[37:57] and she goes and maybe looks at the at
[37:59] the barrel and he said ma he said
[38:02] the meal she can see the barrel full of
[38:04] meal and and cruise full of oil and it
[38:07] is about to overflow it and she may be
[38:10] such an you know she might be in such a
[38:12] big great excitement after seeing what
[38:15] god has done to her right and i believe
[38:18] my brother is my sister that he is same
[38:20] yesterday today and forever
[38:23] he can do that in our lives
[38:26] i have seen time after time time of the
[38:29] time god doing great things
[38:33] i've seen it personally in my life
[38:36] brother there was times you know i just
[38:38] couldn't move out of the house because
[38:40] my pockets were empty but god who is
[38:42] rich in mercy he knows how to provide
[38:45] for his children
[38:46] there were times in our house you know
[38:48] we come from a very poor family there
[38:51] was times you know my mother would you
[38:53] know say to my dad he said no there's
[38:55] nothing for the children
[38:58] and i see sometimes god dad's reaction
[39:01] and and mom's reaction you know and
[39:03] brother sister you know it's very
[39:05] difficult
[39:07] because there's nothing in the bank
[39:09] there's nothing in your pocket there's
[39:10] nothing in the house it's a difficult
[39:12] situation but right there in that kind
[39:15] of situation you may have may not have
[39:17] gone in that kind of situation but i've
[39:19] gone through that i've seen what it
[39:22] means to go hungry i know what it means
[39:25] to live in a poor conditions can you
[39:28] imagine we were born and brought up in
[39:30] 10 by 10 feet house 100 square feet that
[39:33] was our living room that was our bed
[39:36] that was our kitchen that was our
[39:38] everything but let me tell you we had
[39:40] jesus in there
[39:43] we we served god with all our hearts
[39:46] that 10 by 10 room never bothered us
[39:49] we played as children we fought and we
[39:52] did a lot of things but we were happy we
[39:55] were happy because god never you know
[39:57] took us you know
[39:59] in a place where we were hungry god
[40:01] always provided
[40:03] some or the other way god you know he
[40:06] bought somebody to the house he brought
[40:08] some person to the house sometimes you
[40:10] know daddy could walk and and you know
[40:13] you know has nothing and he could open
[40:14] the post office you know box and there
[40:17] was one letter there
[40:19] and somebody from this this country some
[40:21] precious brothers or sisters you know
[40:23] said brother prakash this is a little
[40:25] love offering for you to use for the for
[40:28] your family and for your ministry
[40:30] i've seen time after time
[40:33] i've seen god doing a lot of things like
[40:36] that
[40:37] and you know what god puts us in a place
[40:40] sometime he wants to test us
[40:43] he wants to see brother branham he says
[40:45] be certain of god and he said you know
[40:48] he loves to test us
[40:51] god loves to test us
[40:55] he loves
[40:57] what kind of a god he is
[41:02] he loves to test us
[41:04] he loves to see us sometimes panicking
[41:08] he loves to see us sometimes discouraged
[41:11] that's what happened when tests come you
[41:14] know we get panic sometimes
[41:16] we get so discouraged our heart breaks
[41:18] and and we look
[41:21] we're human beings isn't it
[41:23] but he loves to to put us in that place
[41:28] in that position and he said he loves to
[41:30] see the reaction of your faith
[41:35] he wants to see the reaction of your
[41:37] faith
[41:39] did you know that
[41:41] brethren says god likes to see how you
[41:43] will react right when you say oh lord i
[41:46] believe you about my savior i believe
[41:49] you you are my healer i believe you you
[41:51] are the one who gives the holy spirit
[41:53] and the things that i am requiring you
[41:55] are the god who gives me that and this
[41:58] but then when you confess all your sins
[42:00] and promise god what he will do if you
[42:02] he will let you get well and then become
[42:05] because it don't happen
[42:07] you run off like a covert somewhere
[42:10] god can't use that right there's no way
[42:13] for him to use you
[42:16] there's no way for him to answer you
[42:20] are you with me amen he cannot use us
[42:25] he cannot speak to us
[42:27] he cannot answer us because he only
[42:30] answers by faith
[42:33] amen in that kind of a tight position or
[42:36] circumstances you stand up and say in
[42:39] the name of the lord jesus christ i take
[42:41] over this situation and i'm trying i i'm
[42:45] i'm exercising my faith here
[42:48] no matter how much negative you may see
[42:51] in your life no matter no matter what
[42:53] doctor says
[42:54] right he may tell you you've got a few
[42:56] hours to die
[43:00] sometimes it does
[43:02] because it happened in my own family my
[43:04] mother she went through that you know
[43:06] since several years and several times
[43:08] doctor said
[43:10] you're going to die
[43:12] in 2009 he gave 15 days he said within
[43:14] 15 days she will go but thank god she
[43:17] was there for 2000 till 2014.
[43:21] doctors are
[43:22] not always true
[43:26] sometimes medical science is not always
[43:28] true
[43:31] most of the time
[43:36] you know
[43:37] praise the lord
[43:39] but god's word stands true
[43:43] praise the lord
[43:45] i like that statement he said if you run
[43:47] away like a coward
[43:49] and you know because just you didn't see
[43:50] what he wanted god to do and you know
[43:53] god takes time
[43:55] and as the as we have read he loves to
[43:58] see your reaction
[44:00] he loves to see how you respond to the
[44:03] situation
[44:04] he wants to see how you will deal with
[44:06] that situation you know he wants to see
[44:08] how you'll conduct yourself
[44:17] he said he only answers by faith
[44:20] then all of a sudden you go away and you
[44:22] can't answer but you know what he says
[44:25] the real faith stands there
[44:28] being sure that he is god
[44:32] the real faith will stand
[44:35] it will not move
[44:37] it will take any kind of pressure the
[44:40] faith will right
[44:41] may not our mind and body
[44:44] but the faith which god has given to us
[44:46] it will stand still
[44:48] the faith will take up challenge
[44:51] faith will say let me see what you can
[44:53] do let me see how much you can do
[44:56] let me see how far you can do right but
[44:59] i know inside my heart that i serve a
[45:02] living god and my god is always ready

[48:45] he's god
[48:46] he just can't take it back and say well
[48:50] i was mistaken
[48:51] god makes no mistakes
[48:53] he's perfect
[48:56] and just can you imagine in these days
[48:58] people are trying to mist take mistakes
[49:01] from this and that
[49:03] but here the prophet of god
[49:06] you know there was
[49:08] somebody i don't know who i don't
[49:10] remember but somebody gave me a cd
[49:13] you know
[49:14] compiling a lot of ministers
[49:18] in the time of brother branham
[49:20] and brother branham was one of them
[49:23] a allen was there in that city you know
[49:26] and and
[49:27] people like that

[49:31] in that cd and you know they began to
[49:33] show a man of god after you know one
[49:37] after the other you know and and and and
[49:40] you see brother branham's ministry was
[49:42] very unique
[49:46] when i started watching that cd you know
[49:48] i could feel when i came to the last and
[49:51] and seen brother branham they begin to
[49:53] show the the prophetic ministry in our
[49:56] day and when i begin to watch and see he
[49:58] said nothing could match this man all
[50:01] these people
[50:03] because brother branham you know he was
[50:05] a human being like you and me but you
[50:07] know god was in that man
[50:10] and brother sister when brother branham
[50:12] stood and when he began to discern the
[50:14] lives of the people

[50:19] know and i i forgot the message i was
[50:21] trying to recollect and trying to you
[50:24] know search on my ipad you know there
[50:26] was there was a time
[50:27] i believe it was a lady if i'm not wrong

[50:33] one seven
[50:37] things he begin to discern in her life
[50:40] and for everything she said yes
[50:43] that's true that's true one after the
[50:46] other 17 things
[50:50] not one two three
[50:52] seventeen
[50:55] i i would like to ask somebody today
[50:59] how many of that
[51:01] you know that kind of situation will
[51:03] make us to believe today
[51:06] how many we need in that particular
[51:08] message 17 things he spoke about that
[51:12] one person and he began to tell you know
[51:15] one after the other one after the other
[51:16] one and that lady or that man i don't
[51:19] know if i'm not
[51:20] wrong maybe it's a lady and she said yes
[51:22] sir that's true that's true that's true
[51:25] she never said no this is false
[51:30] glory
[51:31] we have seen the vindication of god
[51:35] we have seen the power of god
[51:37] brother even some of you in your life
[51:39] you might have tasted the power of god
[51:42] that miraculous power that god could
[51:45] bring miracle in our lives you know we
[51:47] are the greatest miracle today that we
[51:50] are saved
[51:52] the greatest miracle we are alive
[51:55] on this face of this earth today
[51:57] that's the greatest miracle
[51:59] what else we need to believe this
[52:01] message
[52:03] what else what more we need to trust
[52:05] this message
[52:08] just think about it
[52:12] she
[52:13] took the word of god
[52:17] and when she began to act
[52:19] god's eyes
[52:21] was saying what she was trying to do
[52:24] she never
[52:25] murdered
[52:27] she never said one word against the man
[52:31] sometimes you know
[52:33] uh there is a saying in in my language
[52:36] when it is a famine
[52:38] 13th month has come
[52:41] there are 12 months in a year
[52:44] but in a famine time 13th month when
[52:47] someone extra has come in
[52:49] so he was elijah was that kind of a
[52:52] situation now
[52:54] she already was in great trouble but
[52:56] here comes a man asking for water and a
[52:58] piece of bread
[53:00] and she
[53:02] took that word
[53:03] oh how i like that my brother's my
[53:05] sister
[53:06] and god put her to test
[53:08] that mid-afternoon
[53:10] and god began to watch her reaction and
[53:14] when god saw that she's doing exactly
[53:16] what the man of god said god began to
[53:19] multiply her blessings
[53:21] and i believe we can have that in our
[53:24] lives
[53:25] there was a preacher there is a preacher
[53:27] in india who preached about this elijah
[53:29] and the meal offering brother one sister
[53:31] a widow you might have all read that in
[53:34] that came in faith challenge several
[53:36] years before but you know what you know
[53:38] we seen that miracle
[53:42] that was for a certain time or maybe a
[53:44] month or two i don't remember exactly
[53:46] but you know she never had to buy a
[53:48] grocery
[53:50] i can tell you
[53:52] when you are faithful in paying tithes
[53:54] when you're faithful you know when you
[53:56] take the word of god and live according
[53:58] to it and when you are faithful in
[54:00] paying tithes and offerings when you are
[54:02] faithful to god god blesses you
[54:05] i can tell you
[54:06] my wife can testify about that there
[54:09] were times that i bring ration for this
[54:11] month and i don't have to bring for next
[54:13] month and next month god blesses that
[54:17] god multiplies that i've seen with my
[54:20] own eyes
[54:21] me and my wife we spoke several times
[54:23] said hey he said how long it's been
[54:25] we've never been any ration to groceries
[54:28] you know groceries in our home and she
[54:31] will go back and say oh it's about
[54:33] how about two three months or two and a
[54:35] half months
[54:37] what
[54:39] you bring groceries today and it goes up
[54:42] to two and a half months
[54:43] how it is possible well when god begins
[54:46] to multiply
[54:48] we don't realize it we don't see we
[54:50] don't recognize it sometimes but god
[54:53] always
[54:55] he's always keeps his way
[54:59] brother branham says you know she met
[55:02] every requirement she lived a clean
[55:05] she lived clean
[55:07] she had lived decent she had lived
[55:09] horrible
[55:11] she had met all god's requirement but
[55:13] look he was silent
[55:16] god does that sometimes to test you and
[55:19] to see what kind of reaction you will
[55:21] have
[55:22] don't forget it
[55:24] he will wait and wait and wait
[55:27] i remember the prophet saying story
[55:29] about the three hebrew children
[55:31] god had to just kept quiet of course he
[55:34] ever he had a conference in heaven but
[55:36] he had to keep quiet till they came to
[55:38] the last step
[55:40] and about the time they were about to
[55:42] pick up and and thrown into the into the
[55:44] fire there came the fourth one
[55:47] but he watched them till the last step
[55:50] i like that
[55:52] my brother's my sister we need to keep
[55:54] that faith
[55:55] until the last morning
[56:01] until we breathe last
[56:04] keep exercising that faith
[56:06] because god will honor your faith god
[56:10] will honor your honesty god will honor
[56:13] your sincerity
[56:14] right
[56:16] oh my
[56:18] it's such a wonderful thing
[56:21] brother branham speaking of job of the
[56:23] old testament
[56:25] he said when satan
[56:27] he said when our accuser accused him of
[56:30] being a secret sinner
[56:32] but job know that he had not sinned
[56:34] right he met god's requirement
[56:37] he know that he has confessed everything
[56:39] that he had done and put a bunt offering
[56:42] out there that was god's requirement
[56:44] that's all god required was that burnt
[56:47] offering and a confession and job done
[56:49] those things
[56:51] and satan
[56:53] he took away his camels
[56:55] his sheep
[56:57] he finally took his children
[57:00] that were closest to his heart
[57:02] brother he was devastated
[57:05] you talk about problems
[57:07] like paul says you know i was buffeted
[57:10] buffeted means a blow after a blow right
[57:13] you know ah a blow after a blow can you
[57:16] imagine joe was a man like you and you
[57:19] know human being like you and me
[57:21] he was just normal person like you and
[57:23] me and you know such a terrible
[57:26] situation
[57:28] he lost his 10 children at once
[57:32] can you imagine the agony and the pain
[57:34] he had to go through
[57:37] and here she comes his wife turns around
[57:40] he said now you curse your god
[57:43] right
[57:44] and you die
[57:47] he lost his ten children
[57:50] he lost all his sheep camels animals you
[57:52] know servants and married servants and
[57:54] many people have dead by now but now
[57:57] his own heart his sweetheart
[58:00] right turns around and he said curse
[58:01] your god
[58:03] he said i don't want to see your
[58:04] integrity anymore
[58:06] he said you curse him and you die
[58:09] job it's better for you to die
[58:13] and in this situation he says
[58:15] please don't talk like a foolish woman
[58:21] he didn't even call her a fool
[58:26] not in a word
[58:28] or indeed
[58:30] big job shamed
[58:32] right
[58:33] he just
[58:34] renders clothes and he put ashes on him
[58:37] and you know he sat down in the heap of
[58:39] action and he said oh the lord hath
[58:42] given and the lord had taken blessed be
[58:44] his name
[58:47] what a life job lived after meeting
[58:50] god's requirement after living a clean
[58:53] life after living a righteous life after
[58:56] living a holy life that pleased god and
[58:59] god himself testified about him
[59:03] and here
[59:04] the man of god on his black day
[59:08] he never sins he never says anything
[59:10] brother branham says
[59:12] but still
[59:13] but still job stood path
[59:16] for he knew that was god
[59:19] he was certain of god
[59:21] right my brothers my sisters
[59:24] i don't think we have never been in this
[59:26] kind of a situation
[59:30] but you see you know how much we are
[59:31] troubled sometimes
[59:33] you see how much we are you know get
[59:35] into
[59:36] things different kinds of things how we
[59:39] are discouraged and how our hearts
[59:41] breaks and you know all these things we
[59:43] see my brothers and my sisters it's very
[59:46] important
[59:48] to stay with the word of god today
[59:52] take the word of god
[59:53] just believe the word of god no matter
[59:56] what the circumstances are just take the
[1:00:00] word of god just believe it as it is
[1:00:02] given to us just blindly trust the word
[1:00:05] of god and brother watch what god does
[1:00:09] you know many times we stand and say is
[1:00:11] god listening to my prayer is god
[1:00:13] hearing my prayer sure he does
[1:00:16] he shall listen to our prayers his ears
[1:00:19] are open to our prayers all the time
[1:00:22] sometimes we don't pray like we should
[1:00:24] you agree with me
[1:00:27] sometimes we don't pray
[1:00:30] we people don't pray much
[1:00:34] i don't know about here in america but
[1:00:36] brother sister i have heard enough from
[1:00:38] the denomination preachers in india he
[1:00:40] said you guys preach great things in
[1:00:42] this
[1:00:43] you said this is a true message you say
[1:00:44] this is the truth and you know you
[1:00:46] preach great mysteries and great deeper
[1:00:48] things from the word of god but you guys
[1:00:50] like one thing he said you all doesn't
[1:00:52] know how to pray
[1:00:59] what we need is prayer alive in these
[1:01:00] days
[1:01:05] anyway i'm going i'm trying to stress on
[1:01:07] this point a little bit we need prayer
[1:01:09] lives no matter who we are no matter how
[1:01:12] you know senior christian we may be
[1:01:15] we need to learn to go on our knees and
[1:01:17] we need to pray
[1:01:19] we need to spend time with god
[1:01:22] yes sir
[1:01:23] brother branham speaks about prayer and
[1:01:25] prayer alive
[1:01:28] i believe you all know about
[1:01:30] about prayer a lot of things
[1:01:32] that brother dale catch i believe he
[1:01:34] made a book on prayer
[1:01:35] yeah
[1:01:37] brother branham said a lot of things
[1:01:39] about prayer he speaks about all night
[1:01:42] prayer
[1:01:43] he speaks about fasting prayer
[1:01:46] he speaks about praying on our knees
[1:01:48] he's speaking about our prayer lies and
[1:01:51] he says our prayer lives have become too
[1:01:53] weak
[1:01:57] just think about it
[1:01:59] you don't pray
[1:02:00] you're not a better christian
[1:02:03] you may know whole bible you may know
[1:02:05] whole message but if there is no prayer
[1:02:07] in your life better you you check your
[1:02:09] life
[1:02:11] you are in a bad terrible situation
[1:02:15] we need prayer brothers and sisters
[1:02:18] we need to see
[1:02:19] that we and our children we pray in our
[1:02:22] houses
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:27] i know i don't get many amens on this
[1:02:29] line
[1:02:30] but that's the truth
[1:02:33] you can preach four hours you can study
[1:02:35] for hours but i'm speaking for myself
[1:02:38] now i can study for long long hours
[1:02:41] you know i can sit for four five six
[1:02:44] hours at a time i can study i can listen
[1:02:46] to the message i can preach for hours
[1:02:48] together i can travel i can do shopping
[1:02:51] i can you know go to this place and that
[1:02:53] place brother i can hardly pray
[1:02:56] and you know what we need to pray we
[1:02:58] need the holy ghost
[1:03:02] prophet of god said a man a person
[1:03:04] doesn't have the holy ghost he cannot
[1:03:06] pray
[1:03:09] you cannot pray you better check whether
[1:03:11] you got holy ghost or not
[1:03:15] i know i'm a little bit strong on this
[1:03:17] but it's the truth
[1:03:19] we need prayer lives
[1:03:21] god will not ask you how much you
[1:03:23] studied how much you know
[1:03:25] let me ask you a plain question
[1:03:27] it will it will really tickle it will
[1:03:29] really you know pinch the minister's
[1:03:31] mind and heart
[1:03:33] brother branham used to pray three hours
[1:03:34] to preach one hour
[1:03:37] you show me one preacher today that
[1:03:38] prays three hours to preach one hour
[1:03:48] i can show you in india
[1:03:50] there are preachers just like my daddy's
[1:03:52] age
[1:03:54] you will see calluses
[1:03:56] found on the on their knees why because
[1:03:59] hours together

[1:05:50] good christian i'd like to tell you a
[1:05:52] little thing before i close this you
[1:05:54] know my brother's my sister when a child
[1:05:56] is born
[1:05:58] listen to this very carefully
[1:06:00] it's a simple thing but it will help us
[1:06:03] when a child is born
[1:06:06] if he is alive and not still
[1:06:09] brother there is a certain thing there
[1:06:11] are certain times the child will cry
[1:06:14] you agree with me mothers
[1:06:17] and the mother knows the time
[1:06:20] why the baby is crying
[1:06:24] so this time she brings water water in a
[1:06:26] bottle to feed that baby
[1:06:29] she looks at the time and she said he's
[1:06:32] thirsty or she's thirsty
[1:06:34] feeds him
[1:06:36] and
[1:06:37] the baby drinks and you know he's happy
[1:06:40] within few minutes he kicks his hands
[1:06:42] and legs and you know you can hear him
[1:06:44] making difference certain sounds and you
[1:06:46] know the mother says yeah you're happy
[1:06:48] now
[1:06:49] but after several
[1:06:51] hours maybe
[1:06:53] the baby cries again right
[1:06:56] and the mother looks why is crying oh he
[1:06:58] must be hungry so she brings him closer
[1:07:01] or her closer to her bosom and feeds
[1:07:04] milk
[1:07:06] because she knows the baby is hungry
[1:07:08] you agree with me
[1:07:11] and the baby you know gladly receives
[1:07:13] what mother gives and you know that is
[1:07:15] the greatest thing a mother can give to
[1:07:16] the baby you know and and and he lives
[1:07:20] and he jumps and you know how the babies
[1:07:22] you know when their stomach is full
[1:07:24] they're happy
[1:07:26] but again he will cry or she will cry
[1:07:28] and the mother knows what to give it to
[1:07:30] him
[1:07:32] right
[1:07:33] if our birth is correct
[1:07:36] and if we are not still born
[1:07:40] we will cry
[1:07:44] we will cry
[1:07:47] i mean we will pray
[1:07:49] because there is a desire in our heart
[1:07:52] and that desire only god can fulfill it
[1:07:56] only god is our satisfying portion only
[1:08:00] god can quench that thirst only god can
[1:08:04] answer that tears only god can look into
[1:08:07] that situation only god is able to
[1:08:10] satisfy that problem or take care of
[1:08:13] that problem if we don't have a desire
[1:08:16] to pray that means we are still born
[1:08:18] yeah right whether you agree with me i'm
[1:08:21] not i'm not i don't have a problem we
[1:08:24] are still born right
[1:08:26] we can claim we are message believers we
[1:08:28] can claim we are christians we can claim
[1:08:30] whatever right
[1:08:32] but remember you are still born right if
[1:08:35] there is any life in you you will have a
[1:08:37] desire right amen
[1:08:40] and that desire will bring you on your
[1:08:42] knees
[1:08:47] oh hallelujah
[1:08:51] job he always
[1:08:52] went ahead
[1:08:54] and gave burnt offerings
[1:08:57] there was a feast in his son's house and
[1:08:59] his sons gave feast and all the 10 of
[1:09:02] them were in the family
[1:09:04] job said
[1:09:05] maybe perhaps my children have committed
[1:09:08] some sin in their hearts
[1:09:10] so he britain 10 altars and he began to
[1:09:13] sacrifice on the altar
[1:09:15] he met god's requirement
[1:09:17] what we need to do we don't need our
[1:09:19] altar today we don't need a bullock or a
[1:09:22] or a sheep or a lamb to sacrifice to god
[1:09:24] but what we need an altar in our hearts
[1:09:27] what we need i pray alive
[1:09:30] he needs praises from this lips
[1:09:37] we need to pray we need to praise him we
[1:09:40] need to worship him
[1:09:45] job in his life
[1:09:49] he was certain
[1:09:51] that he is god
[1:09:54] and he knows that his answer will come
[1:09:58] his faith will be honored he knows
[1:10:03] brother branham speaks about he said if
[1:10:04] you have been anointed and prayed for
[1:10:07] god is waiting to see what you will
[1:10:09] believe about it
[1:10:13] and he says not run up next sunday and
[1:10:15] run the next day until the next healer
[1:10:17] comes through the city he's waiting to
[1:10:19] see your reaction
[1:10:21] of your faith
[1:10:22] not walk back next day and say i feel so
[1:10:25] bad
[1:10:26] i don't guess i got healed you are not
[1:10:29] fit for the prayer line in the first
[1:10:31] place
[1:10:35] and on the other hand brother branham
[1:10:36] makes a statement he said if you got
[1:10:38] faith you don't have to even come in the
[1:10:40] prayer line
[1:10:45] when you don't have faith you are not
[1:10:46] even fit to come in the prayer line
[1:10:49] you don't believe that he is god
[1:10:52] what we need today is to believe on him
[1:10:56] believe this word hallelujah
[1:10:59] job in his time
[1:11:01] you know he wanted somebody who could
[1:11:03] come and intercede for him he was
[1:11:05] looking for somebody to come and comfort
[1:11:07] him he was looking for somebody church
[1:11:09] believers to come and encourage him but
[1:11:11] we know they all came and they said you
[1:11:13] are a secret sinner
[1:11:15] he wanted somebody to come you know and
[1:11:17] build a bridge between the holy god and
[1:11:19] a sinful man
[1:11:20] but you know he was nobody came but then
[1:11:24] as he was waiting on the lord as he kept
[1:11:26] trusting in the lord the inspiration
[1:11:28] struck his mind and heart and brother
[1:11:31] sister when that inspiration dropped
[1:11:32] into his heart then he could see god and
[1:11:35] the lights began to flash and the
[1:11:37] thunders began to roll and when it did
[1:11:39] he stood up upon his feet and said i
[1:11:41] know my redeemer is living
[1:11:44] and i will see him at the end
[1:11:47] praise the lord
[1:11:49] in his troubles in his trials job saw
[1:11:53] resurrection
[1:11:56] jobs are resurrected jesus christ
[1:12:00] and that's why he said my redeemer
[1:12:03] is alive
[1:12:05] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:12:07] oh brother sister
[1:12:10] brother branham goes further and he says
[1:12:13] when the spirit of god is near what will
[1:12:15] take place
[1:12:17] salvation will be introduced
[1:12:19] salvation that will bring a spiritual
[1:12:21] worship not a singing of him altogether
[1:12:23] but a worship in the spirit
[1:12:26] it's got to be contrary so contrary to
[1:12:28] the intellect
[1:12:30] it's timed by it
[1:12:32] he said you cannot understand god by
[1:12:34] intellectual faith
[1:12:35] you must be born again
[1:12:38] praise the lord it's got to come to the
[1:12:40] heart
[1:12:41] it's got to be an experience
[1:12:44] he says when the experience is brought
[1:12:46] by the holy spirit then the same nature
[1:12:48] same power same reaction that happened
[1:12:51] on the church first will come again
[1:12:54] for its god in them
[1:12:57] i like that my brother i like that all
[1:13:00] time
[1:13:01] preaching style i like that old time
[1:13:04] worship i like that all time you know
[1:13:06] the religion brother branham speaks he
[1:13:08] said the same nature will come into him
[1:13:12] but what we need an experience with god
[1:13:14] today
[1:13:15] you may tell me brother sam we have been
[1:13:16] heard we have heard this long time back
[1:13:22] but our life should reflect something
[1:13:28] we need to reflect and we will reflect
[1:13:31] if it is the holy ghost we will reflect
[1:13:33] if it is not then we will reflect too
[1:13:35] yeah but what it takes is an it takes an
[1:13:38] experience that is brought by the holy
[1:13:40] spirit
[1:13:41] and when that experience comes into our
[1:13:43] life will be same nature same power same
[1:13:46] reaction that happened in the church
[1:13:48] first it will be the same now right
[1:13:52] and i believe one day
[1:13:54] we are heading to that spot
[1:13:56] praise the lord before the lecture comes
[1:13:59] brother we will see that same power
[1:14:01] it's here right among us
[1:14:04] you know brother branham says you don't
[1:14:05] have to pray for more power he said you
[1:14:07] got enough power to speak a world into
[1:14:10] existence and step into it and leave
[1:14:13] but what we need is to use that power by
[1:14:16] faith
[1:14:18] that's why we need to pray
[1:14:20] lord increase my faith
[1:14:23] increase my faith
[1:14:25] disciples prayed
[1:14:27] lord increase our faith
[1:14:29] we need to pray lord increase my faith
[1:14:31] my faith
[1:14:33] and when we pray
[1:14:35] that's what brother brown says is a
[1:14:37] prayer for revelation
[1:14:39] faith is
[1:14:40] revelation you keep on praying
[1:14:44] i was trying to to look a guy wearing a
[1:14:47] t-shirt
[1:14:48] you know push
[1:14:51] me and other brother you know we were
[1:14:53] talking and and you know when we came
[1:14:55] across this word push
[1:14:59] and brother
[1:15:00] lloyd told me he said what you know
[1:15:02] brother sam have you ever thought about
[1:15:03] this word push
[1:15:05] p-u-s-h
[1:15:06] pray
[1:15:07] until something happens
[1:15:14] pray until something happens
[1:15:18] the bible says pray without ceasing
[1:15:23] never be tired
[1:15:26] never get tired of praying
[1:15:28] i pray that god will bestow his spirit
[1:15:31] upon us
[1:15:32] and his church will begin to pray
[1:15:35] hallelujah
[1:15:37] we need prayer lives you believe that
[1:15:39] saints
[1:15:40] we need prayer today
[1:15:42] you give more time in prayer
[1:15:45] if you got time just get into the prayer
[1:15:48] you know wherever we are
[1:15:51] i take this
[1:15:52] this one month or 40 days or 45 days
[1:15:55] as my
[1:15:56] pleasure trip you know what i do
[1:15:59] i only pray read study and preach and
[1:16:03] travel
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:06] you wouldn't believe and i i'm getting
[1:16:08] ready to go home i'm like a bull
[1:16:13] my church tells me he said whenever you
[1:16:16] come from united states you are like a
[1:16:18] ball of fire i said praise god
[1:16:22] you know in this time i try to you know
[1:16:26] you know
[1:16:27] i don't know take my my spiritual
[1:16:29] vitamins and you know spiritual
[1:16:31] supplements my dietary supplement you
[1:16:34] know i keep on eating and eating and
[1:16:36] eating anything brother i become like a
[1:16:39] powerful bull
[1:16:42] because i have time here to pray
[1:16:45] it's not that i don't pray in india i
[1:16:48] take every bit of it if i get chance
[1:16:50] i'll get into my office close myself and
[1:16:53] pray
[1:16:55] my brothers and sisters
[1:16:57] we need to meet god's requirement
[1:17:00] we need to have this experience
[1:17:02] to have the same power you know same uh
[1:17:05] nature same kind of reaction just like
[1:17:08] the first church you see the preview of
[1:17:10] the bride you all know that
[1:17:11] you know the the last church is exactly
[1:17:14] the same you know just like the first
[1:17:16] church was he said if god poured out the
[1:17:18] holy ghost on the people of pentecost
[1:17:21] and that was his decision then how how
[1:17:24] that the church must operate under the
[1:17:25] power of the holy spirit he cannot
[1:17:28] change that
[1:17:29] god cannot change that if he put the
[1:17:31] holy ghost in the first church he's
[1:17:33] going to do it and he has done it is
[1:17:35] doing it in this last change praise the
[1:17:38] lord he said and if the church on the
[1:17:40] day of pentecost received the baptism of
[1:17:42] the holy ghost the reaction that came
[1:17:44] from the baptism of the holy ghost will
[1:17:45] be the reaction on every person that
[1:17:48] ever receives the baptism of the holy
[1:17:50] ghost
[1:17:51] it will be the same reaction he says
[1:17:54] because it's the same holy
[1:17:57] amen
[1:17:58] and i believe we have seen it with our
[1:18:00] eyes
[1:18:02] brother branham in paradox he says the
[1:18:03] pillar of fire is identified
[1:18:05] scientifically and by the reaction by
[1:18:08] his character
[1:18:09] and everything else just the same as it
[1:18:12] was when he it was dwelling in the body
[1:18:14] of god's only begotten son so does it
[1:18:18] dwell in the body of his adopted sons
[1:18:21] for the last day
[1:18:24] i'm so glad it's the same holy ghost in
[1:18:27] us we are the adopted sons and daughters
[1:18:30] of god it's the same holy ghost
[1:18:33] and brother we need that
[1:18:37] we can lay aside put aside all the
[1:18:38] things you want to but not this one
[1:18:42] this is the criteria
[1:18:45] why
[1:18:46] because brother branham speaks about he
[1:18:48] said in adam's time the sin was not
[1:18:50] rooted in their hearts in their life it
[1:18:53] was tender
[1:18:54] that's why when god came adam he ran and
[1:18:57] he began to hide himself
[1:19:00] but now
[1:19:01] it's different
[1:19:04] it's different
[1:19:05] no matter what people do they're just
[1:19:07] walking into the church
[1:19:12] it is so rooted and grounded in the
[1:19:14] lives of the people if you want i can
[1:19:16] read that when the first man i said as
[1:19:18] he has sinned and done something wrong
[1:19:20] it's in his presence 62 brother branham
[1:19:22] speaks there and when god came into his
[1:19:25] presence or he come into the presence of
[1:19:27] god adam he could not stand in the
[1:19:29] presence of god he ran and hid himself
[1:19:32] in the bush and tried to cover himself
[1:19:33] with a fig leap because he knowed he was
[1:19:35] standing in the presence of jehovah the
[1:19:37] creator he knew he realized that that
[1:19:40] was the reaction of the first man but
[1:19:42] after he had sinned and tried to come
[1:19:43] into the presence of god with sin upon
[1:19:45] his soul he could not stand brother
[1:19:47] branham said he could not hide but you
[1:19:49] know he says he could not stand because
[1:19:51] you were he was tender yet
[1:19:54] sin had not took a hold like it is
[1:19:56] rooted in the people's heart today but
[1:19:59] he was very conscious
[1:20:01] that he was standing before his creator
[1:20:03] he hid himself in the bushes and would
[1:20:05] not come out and could not come out
[1:20:07] until god had made a preparation for him
[1:20:11] praise the lord
[1:20:12] but today
[1:20:14] people they just
[1:20:17] they're just walking
[1:20:19] they don't have no fear of god in their
[1:20:21] life
[1:20:22] they don't care about him much right now
[1:20:24] the bible speaks in 1st timothy 4 12
[1:20:26] speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
[1:20:29] conscience seared with hot iron
[1:20:33] you know they will act as if nothing
[1:20:35] happened
[1:20:37] they will have act in such a way say we
[1:20:39] didn't know nothing brothers
[1:20:42] you tell about it brother they will get
[1:20:44] upset
[1:20:45] they will not like it
[1:20:47] but
[1:20:50] in that day
[1:20:51] adam
[1:20:56] he had to fight
[1:20:57] because he knew that he's
[1:20:59] god jehovah the creator he's standing in
[1:21:02] his presence
[1:21:04] my brothers my sisters
[1:21:06] you know that's why god has to send his
[1:21:08] son
[1:21:09] to suffer for us
[1:21:11] brother branham says you know we are not
[1:21:14] built that way because we are not god
[1:21:16] but he was god he was god in flesh
[1:21:20] right he said even though this they saw
[1:21:22] you inch to inch and you know chop you
[1:21:24] into pieces he said even you could you
[1:21:27] know you could not die that death
[1:21:30] because your makeup is not like that
[1:21:32] he had to be god
[1:21:34] he said he had to be more than a man in
[1:21:37] the makeup god died he died of a broken
[1:21:40] heart with such a grief for the world
[1:21:41] until a chemical reaction taken place in
[1:21:44] his body that could not take place in
[1:21:46] you
[1:21:47] you cannot suffer like that there's no
[1:21:49] way for you to have that kind of grief
[1:21:51] there's only one
[1:21:53] could do it
[1:21:55] and he did it
[1:21:57] that's why he suffered
[1:21:59] so we need to look
[1:22:01] on him today
[1:22:02] we need to focus our eyes on him because
[1:22:05] he did it on behalf of us
[1:22:07] he became us and we became him
[1:22:10] my precious brothers
[1:22:12] but the bible says as many as i love i
[1:22:15] rebuke and chasten
[1:22:17] be jealous therefore
[1:22:18] and repent
[1:22:21] what we need to do is be jealous today
[1:22:24] and repent
[1:22:25] keep ourselves correct
[1:22:28] put our lives on the altar of god and
[1:22:30] make it set it right and let our life be
[1:22:33] worthy of his word
[1:22:35] let us meet his requirement let us obey
[1:22:37] his word and just act upon the word of
[1:22:40] god and just believe it as it is given
[1:22:42] to us unless god will act
[1:22:44] god will take care of the rest
[1:22:47] may god bless you may god help us all to
[1:22:50] follow this line may god help us to keep
[1:22:52] up our faith in this kind of situation
[1:22:55] and you know jesus had a greatest
[1:22:57] question while he was leaving this that
[1:22:58] he said will i find faith when i come
[1:23:00] right
[1:23:02] that's the criteria today
[1:23:04] i believe god has sent us a message
[1:23:06] today
[1:23:07] brother without any blemish it is a pure
[1:23:10] word of god
[1:23:12] the word of this hour
[1:23:14] and brother this has got a rapturing
[1:23:15] faith if somebody says this is wrong
[1:23:17] then my question is show me something
[1:23:19] better than this
[1:23:20] they are busy criticizing this but they
[1:23:22] are not giving a better suggestion than
[1:23:24] this
[1:23:25] it's beautiful
[1:23:27] right
[1:23:28] they're criticizing this but not able to
[1:23:31] give us a better suggestion than this
[1:23:34] i believe this is the true word of god
[1:23:36] this is the truth and we need to stick
[1:23:38] with it stay with it live by it even if
[1:23:41] we die let us die for this
[1:23:44] because this is the truth and there is
[1:23:46] nothing else god bless you i love you
[1:23:49] all if you don't see me again on this
[1:23:51] face of this earth brother
[1:23:53] if you go first you look for me
[1:23:56] if i go i'll wait on you
[1:23:59] because i will be there
[1:24:00] that's my faith god bless you i turn
[1:24:03] this servant to the man of god
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:12] amen you believe the message amen
[1:24:21] response to the test yes
[1:24:24] what about it
[1:24:28] we put to the test
[1:24:30] you know
[1:24:31] but
[1:24:33] how do we respond after the test is over
[1:24:36] what do we do
[1:24:39] that should be the point shouldn't it
[1:24:41] what we got boys
[1:24:47] give me a clean heart man
[1:24:50] a clean heart because that's what we
[1:24:52] need right
[1:25:09] anybody have a name
[1:25:52] holy spirit
[1:26:07] is that your
[1:26:21] you desired a need coming let's see
[1:26:32] within me
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:15] what he's done for you and i'm
[1:27:30] within
[1:27:41] what do you have nato
[1:27:56] so one thing that probably said we can't
[1:27:58] do too much
[1:28:11] we're supposed to pray to change our
[1:28:12] minds
[1:28:15] not to change his
[1:28:17] but to change our mind
[1:28:21] to what he wants
[1:28:25] not holy
[1:28:32] restore
[1:28:34] unto me
[1:28:37] the joy
[1:28:38] of thy salvation
[1:28:51] restored
[1:29:22] get away from my ideas or what i want
[1:29:26] and get it to watch
[1:29:48] restore unto me
[1:29:59] right
[1:30:33] you know
[1:30:35] he likes to put us to a test
[1:30:38] see if we believe
[1:30:44] you know what
[1:30:45] when you're in a test it's not that the
[1:30:47] lord is a long way from you he's closer
[1:30:50] to you in the test
[1:30:52] than he is when you're not being tested
[1:30:56] we take it backwards
[1:30:59] we think when we're being tested that
[1:31:01] god is all somewhere else
[1:31:06] he's closer to you
[1:31:08] than when you're not going through a
[1:31:10] test
[1:31:12] when things start running too smooth for
[1:31:13] me i get worried
[1:31:17] because i realize the lord must be away
[1:31:19] from me
[1:31:20] but when things are going wrong i know
[1:31:22] he's right with me because that's when
[1:31:24] he said he'd be there
[1:31:26] anybody else to just have a need
[1:31:41] me
[1:31:53] with
[1:32:08] david's saying that the prophet said he
[1:32:10] knew
[1:32:11] that he didn't have any
[1:32:14] said he knew he didn't have any
[1:32:17] he's wanting the lord to restore
[1:32:21] his salvation
[1:32:41] oh
[1:32:42] god
[1:32:48] within me
[1:33:06] within
[1:33:17] just keep me from
[1:33:20] that right
[1:33:22] it just keeps me promised
[1:33:25] because he promised
[1:33:26] i will be with you always didn't say
[1:33:29] always
[1:33:31] that would be contrary but always
[1:33:48] a clean heart just make sure you tell
[1:33:51] brother
[1:33:52] brother samuel how much you appreciate
[1:33:54] him how much appreciated his message
[1:33:55] appreciate him coming being with us we
[1:33:57] say brother uh wes greeley there from
[1:34:00] coming up from columbus to pick him up
[1:34:02] this afternoon you know we appreciate
[1:34:05] these things they really mean something
[1:34:06] to us
[1:34:07] because it's it's people putting forth
[1:34:09] an effort you know to do things
[1:34:12] and serve the lord and to do it make
[1:34:14] sure you tell him how much you
[1:34:15] appreciate him all right
[1:34:16] and remember now what we said this
[1:34:18] morning after the offering this
[1:34:19] afternoon
[1:34:21] we didn't announce it to the kids but we
[1:34:22] did this morning the offering this
[1:34:24] afternoon will go to brother prakash's
[1:34:27] is their ministry there
[1:34:29] all right
[1:34:30] and then that way if you have anything
[1:34:32] you want to give him you feel free to
[1:34:34] give it to him
[1:34:35] but but let me do something cause i've
[1:34:37] got one i've got to cry
[1:34:40] right if you write a check
[1:34:42] write the check to the church here
[1:34:45] and then because a lot of these brothers
[1:34:47] can't take care of the checks on the way
[1:34:50] write to check to the church
[1:34:52] and then we will give him the money
[1:34:54] because that way you don't have to worry
[1:34:57] about handling the checks on that basis
[1:34:59] it turns out a whole lot better then
[1:35:01] that way you can write off your
[1:35:03] what you give to on your tithe you know
[1:35:05] i mean write it off on your taxes
[1:35:07] sometimes because it'll be that way but
[1:35:09] just make sure you write it out to the
[1:35:11] church and then you know and make do it
[1:35:13] that way or try to give cash because
[1:35:16] these brothers are traveling and doing
[1:35:18] and all and we we do have a contact part
[1:35:21] where we can
[1:35:22] can contact brother percussion and
[1:35:24] everything in the ministry there
[1:35:26] and we always take care of the expenses
[1:35:28] of you know we don't take up an offering
[1:35:31] for the minister that preaches
[1:35:33] because we do that as a church but we
[1:35:35] let all the money go that comes into the
[1:35:37] offering to them for the work that
[1:35:40] they're doing in all of that part okay
[1:35:42] so what we're going to do if it's all
[1:35:44] right with everybody we'll just also
[1:35:46] give him a check that he can take back
[1:35:48] with him
[1:35:50] to india from the church here
[1:35:52] of about 1500 to where that it can they
[1:35:56] can put it into the work dire
[1:35:58] and you know do the things he was saying
[1:36:00] that the church needed painting but uh
[1:36:03] whatever they do with it that's up to
[1:36:05] them that's right that's not that we
[1:36:06] control that part we just send it so if
[1:36:08] they're all right so we'll do that plus
[1:36:10] whatever is given unto him okay
[1:36:13] everybody happy anybody anything to say
[1:36:15] before we go
[1:36:16] remember my wife the lord willing is
[1:36:18] supposed to be operated on
[1:36:20] friday
[1:36:21] um
[1:36:22] somewhere close to 12 12 30.
[1:36:26] all right so just remember at that time
[1:36:27] and just that the lord would bless her
[1:36:29] and take care of her and
[1:36:31] we still believe that he can take care
[1:36:32] of it before friday gets here because we
[1:36:35] don't worry about that we just depend on
[1:36:37] the whole thing and then the lord take
[1:36:39] care of it right what else we got
[1:36:41] waiting
[1:36:44] brother forney will be here with us
