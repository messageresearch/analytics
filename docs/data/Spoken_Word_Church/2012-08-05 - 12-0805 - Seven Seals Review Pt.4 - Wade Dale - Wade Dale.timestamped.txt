[0:00] okay
[0:03] revelations chapter six
[0:10] let's just go ahead and read down
[0:12] through
[0:17] verse
[0:20] 8.
[0:21] all right so that's going to take care
[0:22] of the first four
[0:24] and today i will finish the review next
[0:26] sunday we will begin on the fifth seal
[0:30] so everybody read the fifth seal
[0:35] um
[0:36] what brother running priest on the fifth
[0:38] seal all right
[0:42] and i saw the lamb had opened one of the
[0:44] seals and i heard as it were excuse me
[0:45] the noise of thunder one of the four
[0:47] beasts saying come and see
[0:49] and i saw him behold a white horse and
[0:50] he said on him had a boat
[0:52] and a crown was given unto him and he
[0:54] went forth conquering him to conquer
[0:57] and when he had opened the second seal i
[0:58] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:01] and they went out another horse it was
[1:02] red and power was given to him that sat
[1:04] there on to take peace from the earth
[1:06] and they should kill one another and
[1:08] there was given unto him a great sword
[1:09] look at all these things it says given
[1:12] power was given
[1:14] so satan has no power unless who gives
[1:16] it to him god allows him but we give him
[1:19] the power all right
[1:22] and when he had opened the third seal i
[1:23] heard the third beast say come and see
[1:25] and i'll be held
[1:27] and
[1:28] and lo a black horse and he that said on
[1:30] him had a pair of balances in his hand
[1:32] and i heard a voice in the midst that
[1:34] the four beasts say
[1:35] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[1:37] measures of barley for a penny say i'll
[1:39] not hurt
[1:40] the oil and wine when he had opened the
[1:42] fourth seal i heard the voice of the
[1:43] fourth beast which was white
[1:46] fourth beast is white
[1:48] eagle
[1:49] eagle lion ox man and eagle right here
[1:51] lion ox man an eagle the fourth beast is
[1:53] an eagle all right
[1:55] and when he had opened the fourth seal
[1:56] that's what we're gonna i didn't we're
[1:58] gonna back up to the fourth seal because
[2:00] we kind of covered one two and three but
[2:02] uh sister frieza is coming now new today
[2:05] and uh
[2:06] we might need to back up just a second
[2:10] and cover it
[2:12] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[2:14] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[2:15] come and see and i looked and behold a
[2:16] pale horse
[2:18] and his name now there's no other name
[2:19] now talk about any name before then it's
[2:21] till now
[2:22] and his name that set on him was death
[2:24] and hell followed with him and power was
[2:27] given there you go again power was given
[2:29] unto them over the fourth part of the
[2:30] earth to kill with the sword and with
[2:32] hunger and with death
[2:34] and with the beasts of the earth all
[2:36] right we're gonna stop right there
[2:37] because the first four seals
[2:39] covers
[2:40] the plan of redemption
[2:43] all right it's not just if the white
[2:45] horse riders the antichrist i don't want
[2:48] satan revealed to me
[2:50] i want jesus christ revealed to me
[2:52] that's going to do away with
[2:54] satan right
[2:56] if christ is revealed
[2:57] paul said if christ be formed in us
[3:00] all right so christ is going to be
[3:02] formed in us everybody thinks the seal
[3:04] the great opening of the of the seals
[3:06] was that it it revealed the antichrist
[3:10] no it exposed the antichrist
[3:12] because the bible said
[3:14] all this power was given to this person
[3:16] but brother brown said when he comes
[3:17] over there and i believe it's an
[3:19] invisible union he said
[3:21] christ is the seal
[3:23] well everybody thought hold on the devil
[3:24] no christ is the seal this is the whole
[3:26] plan of redemption in four seals
[3:29] everybody understand that so far say yes
[3:31] yes all right but we got to take five
[3:34] six and seven
[3:35] for a special purpose but we've got to
[3:38] bring five six and seven
[3:40] right here and bring it right back to
[3:42] right here
[3:44] everybody understand that
[3:47] you don't say no no okay all right
[3:50] that's fine we're going to get to that
[3:51] because remember the rapture takes place
[3:53] on the fourth seal
[3:56] so we're gone
[3:58] then we don't need five six and seven no
[4:00] we don't not the earthly part that goes
[4:01] to the jews right five is a jewish
[4:05] what's six plagues
[4:07] great tribulation things falling on the
[4:09] earth we're not going to be here
[4:11] all right and we know the seventh seal
[4:12] is christ himself because he comes to
[4:14] get who he comes to get to jews
[4:17] through two witnesses is that correct
[4:19] all right we're gonna have participation
[4:21] from now on
[4:22] but if you don't you know if you don't
[4:23] understand it just say no and i'm not
[4:25] looking at who's gonna say no if i hear
[4:27] a no i'm going to stop we're going to
[4:28] cover it again all right
[4:30] so 5 6 and 7 seal 5 6 and 7 is naturally
[4:35] to the jews
[4:38] but if you don't take 5 6 and 7 and see
[4:40] the redemption of your body
[4:43] there's not going to be a rapture right
[4:47] we which are alive and remain is right
[4:50] here
[4:54] has all the seals revealed
[4:56] in their life all right because there's
[4:58] going to be untold millions of people
[5:01] have rapture in faith and they don't
[5:02] know a thing about seals
[5:09] paul had raptured faith
[5:11] irenaeus had a rapture in faith because
[5:12] you know what when a resurrection
[5:14] happens the faith that he had
[5:16] sorry the faith he still has
[5:18] in the sixth dimension is gonna what
[5:20] resurrect him so he has rapturing faith
[5:22] for his time
[5:25] but hebrews 11 40 says they without us
[5:28] cannot be made perfect so
[5:30] they
[5:32] without us
[5:37] say yes or no you got it yes yes they
[5:39] the ones that are dead already dead and
[5:41] gone paul william branham
[5:43] included
[5:45] he's dead
[5:47] they
[5:48] just like brother dick says until he's
[5:50] dead
[5:52] everybody else is they but if brother
[5:54] dick dies he comes under that part of
[5:56] that right
[5:58] okay they without us
[6:00] is going to get a true revelation of all
[6:02] seven seal
[6:04] the true revelation of the seventh seal
[6:06] not just what was printed in a book
[6:09] remember the love letter brother brown
[6:11] spent many many hours preaching of the
[6:13] love letter of what's between the lines
[6:16] all right
[6:17] that's why brother brown told the people
[6:19] he said it's gone from you you're not
[6:20] going to get it
[6:21] it's not even for you and that was in
[6:23] 1963
[6:24] he said i run around the coming of the
[6:26] lord somebody's going to pick up the
[6:27] revelation of this
[6:29] and going to sweep it on to what the
[6:31] rapture
[6:32] all right so the rapture happens on the
[6:33] fourth seal now let's look just for the
[6:36] sake of having um
[6:38] helping some that's starting now which
[6:40] is wonderful i don't mind it
[6:43] the first seal was what a black
[6:44] righteous church went riding out right
[6:47] brother brown said here stands the lamb
[6:48] with the book's hand there goes the
[6:49] white horse rider
[6:51] therefore you must be the antichrist
[6:52] right
[6:53] now in the first in the first three ages
[6:56] the church ages paul irenaeus and martin
[7:00] is covered under this white righteous
[7:02] church
[7:03] i've been reading some more history on
[7:05] rome man you just can't believe what
[7:07] them people got by with but it was
[7:08] little sayings and little things that
[7:10] they would say to the people
[7:12] in the nicean council in in in 325 and
[7:16] in 606 a.d because the church ended
[7:18] really at 606 right here about where
[7:20] that night city council came out is when
[7:22] the third church age ended and then they
[7:24] went over into the dark ages which was
[7:26] about 1500 years of roman rule all right
[7:29] so if you read history it kind of ties
[7:31] into all the seals and the
[7:34] and the church ages so church age one
[7:36] two and three paul arenas and martin
[7:37] they were under the lion anointing lie
[7:40] l-i-o-n lion anointing
[7:42] which is what bold spoke of the king
[7:45] if you'll even read if you have a
[7:46] scofield bible
[7:49] let's look right here in matthew
[7:52] if you're looking at the commentary of
[7:53] matthew if you have if you don't go
[7:54] through the bible that's okay
[7:58] there's a commentary on page 990 you
[8:00] have a scofield bible it's right before
[8:02] the book of matthew there is a
[8:04] commentary
[8:06] even
[8:08] even
[8:09] um
[8:11] scofield watch it says and all the light
[8:14] is revealed the one unique personality
[8:16] the one jesus is king and matthew now
[8:19] what's king who's king of the beast
[8:21] lion
[8:23] all right
[8:24] servant and mark i'm quoting scofield
[8:27] servant and mark everybody got that
[8:30] you've got to go field bible reading
[8:31] page 990 in the footnotes down at the
[8:33] very bottom of the page
[8:35] and all the life is revealed the one
[8:36] unique personality the one jesus is king
[8:38] and matthew now schofield didn't get
[8:41] this from brother brown
[8:44] he died right before brother around god
[8:46] come on the scene
[8:47] all right so this was the lord revealing
[8:49] something to him to show him
[8:51] all right
[8:53] the one jesus is king in matthew ox our
[8:56] servant in mark which servant ox
[8:59] sacrifice
[9:00] man in luke
[9:03] and god and john are eagle
[9:06] everybody got that
[9:07] and then you look in your footnotes and
[9:09] when you go to saint matthew the first
[9:10] gospel there on page 993
[9:14] talks about the king the covenant king
[9:16] the king the king the king the king the
[9:18] king
[9:19] then you go to mark it'll go to the ox
[9:21] and so forth so so this is not something
[9:23] that's not been
[9:26] and i don't i want you to listen to what
[9:28] i'm saying
[9:29] brother brown didn't come up with these
[9:31] things and he was not the original one
[9:33] to bring him out scofield talks about a
[9:35] theophany before brother brown megan
[9:37] came on the earth but what did god do
[9:39] brother branham come in to tie all the
[9:41] loose ends because scofield will go so
[9:43] far and then he'll lean toward that
[9:44] trinity
[9:46] right he'll lean toward the trinity but
[9:49] what brother ronald have to do he come
[9:50] to bring the loose ends back together
[9:52] and put us on a straight path where we
[9:54] can look at this and go hey
[9:58] this was correct in its day
[10:02] but not right in our day because see
[10:04] they baptized father son holy ghost here
[10:06] that baptized father father son holy
[10:08] ghost in three ages and part of that age
[10:12] and god give them eternal life
[10:14] because of their ignorance of the
[10:16] preaching of the gospel that that the
[10:18] devil had come in and lied to the people
[10:20] but now one two and three church age one
[10:22] two and three they have the name of
[10:23] jesus right all things were right and
[10:25] correct that was the lion that was the
[10:27] boldness of god in the people all right
[10:29] so there was your lion
[10:32] of the first beast which the lion said
[10:34] come and see all right
[10:36] then the white horse rider goes right
[10:38] now well why
[10:39] why do we want to say well there goes
[10:41] satan no
[10:43] there goes satan but what happened first
[10:47] god had to do something first satan is
[10:50] never original right
[10:52] satan never does anything original
[10:54] never
[10:56] he's always copying after god
[10:59] right so god already then had a white
[11:01] righteous church on the scene
[11:04] the book of acts started the white
[11:06] righteous church the real one
[11:08] so in opposition satan starts in a
[11:10] little saying
[11:13] little sayings little things hey what
[11:15] about this virgin mary and what about
[11:17] this
[11:18] um
[11:20] virgin mary
[11:25] and what about all these things
[11:30] there was a white righteous church
[11:33] disguised
[11:34] satan disguised itself because hey there
[11:36] was a white righteous church
[11:38] so satan copied after that white
[11:40] righteous church and put his own white
[11:42] righteous church out there and they ate
[11:44] down you go down through the through the
[11:46] four
[11:47] the four um caterpillar locusts we don't
[11:50] have time to do that but you can put
[11:51] them everyone in here the same way
[11:53] because they first start eating the
[11:54] leaves which is fellowship or fellowship
[11:56] and then they start eating the bark
[11:57] broth around which is the doctrine and
[11:58] then all you so right here they started
[12:00] with the doctrine satan started and said
[12:02] hey what about this
[12:04] is he a separate person from god or just
[12:06] like that ceremonies
[12:08] corinthians was way back here
[12:11] saying that jesus wasn't god until the
[12:14] holy ghost came on him
[12:15] uh on the river jordan well guess what
[12:18] we got preachers in the message
[12:19] preaching the same thing that this guy
[12:20] was preaching in the first church age
[12:22] that was the devil same spirit
[12:25] remember the serrentius got the he was
[12:27] even in a bathhouse and remember who was
[12:29] it paul arenas or one of them or martin
[12:31] one of them ran out of the bathhouse and
[12:32] said i ain't gonna be in the bath house
[12:33] for this guy
[12:34] he's so wrong so off the word
[12:36] well you know what devils don't die
[12:39] devils will not be killed until the lake
[12:41] of fire
[12:42] so they're still alive and well
[12:44] like brother claude and i were talking
[12:45] the other night that man over in iran
[12:47] that ahmadinejad
[12:50] he's got the same characteristics and
[12:52] spirit that adolf hitler has
[12:54] he's wanted to do the same thing
[12:56] it's just in a little different form
[12:58] well when that devil come off adolf
[12:59] hitler when they killed him and burned
[13:00] him over there in germany that same
[13:02] devil just went over there and found
[13:04] somebody that would accept him over here
[13:06] all right in this age so same thing
[13:09] devils don't die they just kind of move
[13:10] around
[13:11] all right
[13:12] but god never dies and never will die
[13:15] and the holy ghost is more powerful than
[13:17] any of this
[13:18] so that's what we have to depend on
[13:21] so we see the first aid just typed in
[13:23] justification
[13:24] in us being once you're justified you're
[13:27] white righteous
[13:28] you're just as righteous as god is
[13:30] because your sins are forgiven but now
[13:32] remember the journey that you continue
[13:33] on you still got that smoking devil
[13:36] cussing devil and all that stuff still
[13:37] in you right
[13:39] but when you come to sanctification what
[13:41] is red
[13:42] blood
[13:43] the only thing that sanctifies us is
[13:44] what the blood of
[13:48] thank you the blood of jesus christ i
[13:51] don't know
[13:52] love jesus christ
[13:54] if i said he wanted a hundred dollars i
[13:56] got a bigger a better answer than that
[14:00] all right so the second horse goes right
[14:02] now
[14:03] it's a red horse
[14:05] blood brother brown said that red horse
[14:07] rode through and killed
[14:10] what's the fourth ace that's the dark
[14:12] age remember 68 million protestants were
[14:14] killed in that fourth church age
[14:17] under the office anointing all they done
[14:19] was just said i believe in god and they
[14:21] killed them
[14:22] but but god sealed them away and put
[14:25] them in the body of christ because they
[14:27] believed the message for their hour
[14:29] under columba
[14:30] you know that
[14:31] say yes yes all right
[14:34] red horse
[14:37] blood means blood is red right
[14:40] blood is red so the red horse rider
[14:43] literally killed 68 million protestants
[14:46] shed their literal red blood
[14:48] but brother brown said untold billions
[14:50] they killed with their doctrine
[14:53] all right because that's going to untold
[14:55] millions that kill the doctrine is going
[14:57] to come over here in black and black
[14:58] there's one dead black always means
[15:00] death
[15:01] right there's no light in death
[15:04] all right so black is death
[15:06] so we see that the fourth age fourth
[15:08] church age
[15:09] parallels with the second seal and
[15:12] sanctification for us because the only
[15:14] way we're to be sanctified is what by
[15:16] the blood of jesus christ that's what
[15:17] the
[15:18] bible says all right and sanctification
[15:20] remember the bible says we read it the
[15:22] other day the unclean spirit goes out of
[15:23] a man walks in dry places take his rest
[15:26] and find his nine
[15:29] comes back
[15:31] if you don't get filled with the holy
[15:32] ghost he's gonna make you seven times
[15:33] worse he ain't gonna make it seven times
[15:35] worth of devil he's gonna make you a
[15:36] christian
[15:37] so-called and put you in church
[15:39] all right that's why i said last night
[15:41] when we were talking in the bible study
[15:42] sanctification is a very very wonderful
[15:45] place to be in but it's a very very
[15:49] terrible place to be in if you stay
[15:50] there
[15:51] because judas was sanctified
[15:54] the devil himself
[15:56] the devil himself can live this message
[16:00] the devil himself can live this message
[16:04] but he can't put the word together
[16:06] all right he can live he can live this
[16:07] message to the letter and still be lost
[16:10] but sanctification the unclean spirit
[16:13] does go out right that's right
[16:16] see see the smoking drinking cussing and
[16:17] all that should go out here you
[16:19] shouldn't have any problems with it here
[16:21] i don't mean problem i mean you
[16:22] shouldn't have that
[16:25] thing inside of you to where it comes
[16:27] out
[16:28] you remember my story
[16:30] i believe i received the baptism of the
[16:32] holy ghost back in
[16:33] in
[16:34] and
[16:35] one no two thousand and uh
[16:38] in kentucky
[16:39] and jim's dad motorhome i just believe
[16:41] that's where god you know finally
[16:43] after i quit
[16:45] trying
[16:46] to get it he gave it to me but see
[16:50] going down the road i used to say bad
[16:53] words and i'm telling the critic because
[16:54] you hadn't heard it
[16:56] i used to say a lot of bad words
[16:58] a lot
[17:00] a lot
[17:02] right
[17:03] part of my vocabulary in other words it
[17:05] was just part of the website
[17:08] but i was talking to a friend of mine
[17:10] that was a previous friend back in the
[17:12] world and we were talking about
[17:13] something and and in my mind i wanted to
[17:15] say i want to kick that guy in a double
[17:18] s
[17:19] but when i got the a out of my mouth to
[17:21] say that something hit me right here
[17:23] just went punched me right here in the
[17:24] chest and all the air my lungs went out
[17:28] and and ken said what did you do i saw
[17:30] don't worry about it i was going to say
[17:32] a bad word the lord stopped me
[17:34] so he had a long silence because he
[17:36] don't understand this stuff anyway so
[17:38] the lord preserves me
[17:39] to keep me from saying it
[17:42] brother branham said
[17:44] hand me the cigarette
[17:46] hand me the alcohol
[17:48] he was going to partake of it right
[17:51] but god stopped him right all right
[17:54] and you know what somebody asked that
[17:55] question said well why is he playing
[17:57] favoritism to brother brown he wasn't
[17:59] playing favoritism to the man
[18:01] he was playing favoritism to the gift
[18:04] he was going to keep that gift clean and
[18:06] you can't take the man in the gift and
[18:08] separate it so he had to keep william
[18:10] branham clean because we can't keep
[18:12] ourselves clean we gotta have what
[18:16] daily i die daily a daily sanctification
[18:19] all right
[18:22] that's why we need experiences in our
[18:24] life for god to show us what stage of
[18:26] the journey we're in and i made a
[18:28] statement last night and i'm not gonna
[18:30] back on that one to back up on it one
[18:31] bit
[18:32] ninety percent of people in this message
[18:34] are probably just sanctified
[18:39] but it says fear not little flop not a
[18:42] great big one
[18:44] but if you're in sanctification then you
[18:46] can move on then to the baptism of the
[18:48] holy ghost praise god
[18:50] you may walk 20 years in a church and be
[18:52] sanctified but one day god if god will
[18:55] honor your faith
[18:57] to believe that you received the baptism
[18:58] of the holy ghost because you're always
[19:00] believing unto you
[19:01] you're believing unto that's right yes
[19:03] but i still you i want y'all to read if
[19:05] you still got root of bitterness and all
[19:07] these things in your life read the
[19:08] prophet's message he was very clear
[19:10] those things need to be out of our life
[19:12] and gone yeah they don't need to be
[19:13] something that resurrects that's right
[19:15] it needs to be dead when it's dead you
[19:18] can't accuse it enough amen
[19:20] you can't bring it back up
[19:22] you can't accuse me of that because it's
[19:23] dead
[19:24] all right
[19:25] my grandpa was he died in 1945. you
[19:28] can't accuse him in 196 uh in 2011 of a
[19:31] of a murder or
[19:33] or you can accuse all you want to but
[19:35] sam dale's dead
[19:37] so unless he resurrects and wasn't dead
[19:40] to start with
[19:41] he can't do these things
[19:43] that's the same way when we did the
[19:44] baptism sunday
[19:46] baptism
[19:48] you're dead leave it there
[19:50] let the water wash it out of you
[19:52] and come back up in units of life all
[19:54] right
[19:55] but i just i that's just my that's just
[19:57] my thoughts seeing how people act and
[19:59] react
[20:00] that sanctification is a very wonderful
[20:02] place to be because he does forgive you
[20:04] of all that stuff all that stuff goes
[20:06] out of you that sanctification
[20:09] but now remember too
[20:11] you got to believe on you got to come
[20:13] from the red
[20:14] and go into the number three which is
[20:17] the black horse
[20:19] all right now the black horse rider went
[20:21] out
[20:22] he went out and done the same thing but
[20:24] what did god do god brought a man
[20:26] anointing
[20:28] fifth and sixth church age
[20:32] i've said a lot in 20 minutes god
[20:34] stopped that clock because i want him to
[20:35] stop that clock so we can get this done
[20:38] so i keep looking at it and ain't moving
[20:39] much
[20:41] fifth and sixth church age is under the
[20:43] third seal
[20:45] everybody got that same man
[20:47] all right so that and that's a man
[20:48] anointing now the fifth age was what
[20:51] luther and wesley luther started putting
[20:52] the bible together right
[20:54] king james and all in 1611 and all those
[20:57] times in history reedy's hit you guys
[21:00] went to school
[21:01] all these histories like constantine and
[21:03] all that don't you remember those when
[21:04] brother brown brings them up they're in
[21:05] history it's common history so this is
[21:08] not something that that wasn't made
[21:10] known it's just that brother brown
[21:11] pulled it all together and said hey this
[21:13] is why this happened this is why this
[21:14] happened they said well this happened he
[21:16] tied the loose ends up
[21:18] gave us a straight way to go all right
[21:20] fifth and six eights luther and wesley
[21:22] correct
[21:23] all right the man anointing
[21:25] right according to your combat beast
[21:27] lion ox man an eagle
[21:29] man anointing it was a black horse which
[21:31] was
[21:32] death but now remember it wasn't named
[21:34] death
[21:36] they were still baptized in the name of
[21:38] father son holy ghost not the name of
[21:40] jesus christ
[21:41] so they didn't have a name right
[21:45] but the blackness of that age blacks a
[21:47] lot of people out
[21:50] but you can also you say well what's
[21:52] black got to do with having the holy
[21:53] ghost just what i said if you're if
[21:55] satan is not dead in you
[21:58] you don't have a holy god
[22:00] god can't dwell on an unclean vessel
[22:04] that's just common knowledge
[22:07] but the black horse means that you're
[22:08] dead
[22:10] you died
[22:11] i died up there in in kentucky uh on set
[22:14] on a river
[22:16] or lake i died that's where i died sure
[22:18] i got baptized and i walked in newness
[22:20] of life
[22:21] through justification sanctification but
[22:23] when i come to a spot where god says
[22:25] that old you is gone you don't have to
[22:27] worry about that old you anymore
[22:30] that ought to just thrill your heart
[22:32] that's why i think that a lot of
[22:33] people's not at that point yet because
[22:34] it will really
[22:35] it'll change everything your thought
[22:37] process it'll change your ideas it'll
[22:39] change all it'll make you soft
[22:42] remember he takes the stony heart out
[22:45] he doesn't put a board back in
[22:48] what do you say i put a
[22:49] flesh is pliable
[22:53] right yeah
[22:55] and that's what that is flesh is pliable
[22:58] he takes a stoney heart out and puts a
[23:01] heart of flesh
[23:03] back in he doesn't give you a heart
[23:05] transplant but what does he do he
[23:06] softens up the one you got not your
[23:08] heart your thumping thing
[23:10] but the inner part of you he softens you
[23:12] up
[23:13] and makes you
[23:15] a christian
[23:16] all right so one two and three is
[23:17] everybody okay with that yeah all right
[23:20] number four number four is the fourth
[23:23] horse rider
[23:25] it is a pale horse now if you take i
[23:27] told you before take the color black red
[23:29] and white put it in the bucket and stir
[23:32] it up
[23:33] you've got the most putrid grayish
[23:37] reddish
[23:39] it just looks nasty
[23:41] but that's what that pale horse is
[23:43] it's this one
[23:45] plus this one
[23:47] plus this one
[23:49] all wrapped up into that one
[23:51] right
[23:53] because you say well how can you explain
[23:55] express that
[23:56] justification wrapped up in the
[23:58] sanctification wrapped up into the
[23:59] baptism of the holy ghost makes you
[24:01] agree with the word makes you the word
[24:03] not a different person makes you the
[24:05] word made manifest right
[24:07] so white horse red horse all these
[24:09] demons are now piled up
[24:12] into this age
[24:14] so every demon that this age fall we
[24:16] gotta fight that's right this eighth
[24:18] fault we gotta fight this age fought we
[24:20] gotta fight because it's all made into a
[24:22] pale horse and the bible says his name
[24:25] was called death now he was deaf back
[24:27] here
[24:28] right remember he was death here he was
[24:30] death all through him satan's never life
[24:32] he's always death
[24:34] so satan started his death but there was
[24:35] nobody could name it until the evil
[24:37] anointing come so he could go up higher
[24:40] see further
[24:41] and be able to turn back and say hey
[24:44] that thing's named death you need to
[24:45] leave it alone get rid of it all right
[24:49] so in the word is life so the word went
[24:51] forth in the fourth seal which is a
[24:53] parallel now it's like parallel with the
[24:55] seventh church age that's the age we're
[24:57] in right now
[24:58] which is the eagle anointing the lion
[25:01] he's about this tall
[25:03] but if his grass is tall i don't care
[25:05] how powerful he is he can't see any
[25:07] further than the grass
[25:09] the ox is a little bit higher he's about
[25:10] this side he can maybe see over the
[25:12] grass but he's very slow very burdensome
[25:15] right the man you and i we can see
[25:17] further than any of those animals
[25:19] because we're taller we can see further
[25:21] right but now the eagle when he gets up
[25:24] he sees as far that way that way that
[25:26] went that way
[25:27] all right so that's why i had to come in
[25:29] the eagle age
[25:30] you could see that god was raising the
[25:32] people higher well as god was raising
[25:34] the people higher higher the devil's not
[25:36] a dummy he's going right with him
[25:39] right
[25:40] into a pale horse so he's having to use
[25:43] all these powers against us
[25:46] because we're the true church because we
[25:47] got to have rapture in faith
[25:50] we got to be the one that called the
[25:51] dead out of the ground the dead in
[25:53] christ arrives first
[25:54] and we which are alive and remain to be
[25:56] caught up and meet the lord in the air
[25:58] all right
[25:59] so brother brown that's why brother
[26:00] brown said the rapture happens on the
[26:02] fourth seal
[26:03] now look you
[26:05] don't get it in your mind
[26:08] that then five six and seven is for the
[26:09] jews only and it's it is naturally it
[26:12] goes to the jews
[26:13] but spiritually we gotta bring that
[26:15] thing right back around because we're
[26:18] all
[26:18] jews
[26:19] spiritually right
[26:21] not all israel is israel
[26:24] all right so not all
[26:27] randomized for ramadan or brown
[26:28] you understand what i'm saying
[26:32] but you got to take these last three
[26:34] seals and you got to bring them around
[26:36] and put them inside somebody
[26:39] because this is what's got to change
[26:44] that was my point to finish with look
[26:46] this age had a rapture and faith for its
[26:48] time
[26:49] but it didn't have all the work right
[26:53] this church age had just enough to get
[26:55] them in the body a little bit of light
[26:56] but still though it doesn't matter
[26:58] they're not going to sit on little
[26:59] stools and we're going to sit on the
[27:00] stool
[27:01] okay
[27:02] we're all bright when they said thrones
[27:04] they put the thrones in one spot all
[27:06] right they're going to judge
[27:08] they're going to judge their age just
[27:10] like you and i are going to judge our
[27:11] age
[27:12] it's just that they're going to judge
[27:13] their age and say hey you turned down
[27:17] god's going to say hey you turned down
[27:18] what this brother columba was saying
[27:20] therefore you go to hell right
[27:22] so they're just as important
[27:24] yes
[27:26] same way with luke and wesley even
[27:27] though they didn't bring the name out
[27:30] they still baptized fathers unholy ghost
[27:31] believed in the trinity but winked at
[27:33] their ignorance because what the eagle
[27:35] anointing had not come to raise on earth
[27:38] to put all the loose ends back together
[27:40] and give us and this is what's going to
[27:41] give us rapturing faith
[27:44] i told you many times before
[27:46] the
[27:46] reason that i can't
[27:49] rewire a house is because i don't
[27:50] understand electricity
[27:54] these church age messengers did not
[27:56] understand
[27:57] rapture and faith they just knew they
[27:59] had to have it so they were believing
[28:00] unto you
[28:01] everybody got that
[28:02] but now see if i go to school and let a
[28:05] master teacher
[28:08] that can see further
[28:10] see higher
[28:11] put all the loose ends together
[28:13] you know what that takes out all fear
[28:15] because a master electrician can look in
[28:17] this room and go okay we need to put
[28:18] wires here and here see richard did all
[28:20] this right here
[28:22] i can't do that richard you didn't glue
[28:24] that back
[28:33] he's got faith
[28:34] he knows he has knowledge about what
[28:36] he's doing
[28:38] that's what rapture and faith is they
[28:40] didn't have the knowledge to get them
[28:41] out to get them out of here
[28:43] they'd have the knowledge they had to
[28:44] wait till the eagle morning come to the
[28:46] seventh church age messenger come so
[28:48] brother brown would come and reveal god
[28:51] to us
[28:53] to open these seals up to us now we can
[28:55] have rapture in faith
[28:59] there's only going to be a very minou
[29:01] group of people that's going to
[29:02] understand these three and change their
[29:04] bodies
[29:05] all right the rest are going to be they
[29:08] which are alive
[29:09] and remain but you know what you're
[29:11] going to go down let's read rotate
[29:13] right before we leave
[29:17] see this kind of puts it all in
[29:18] perspective to me
[29:22] romans 8
[29:25] verse 11.
[29:30] let's read 10
[29:34] and if christ be in you
[29:36] the body is dead because of sin
[29:39] but the spirit is life
[29:41] because of righteousness
[29:43] all right but if the spirit of him that
[29:45] raised up jesus from the dead dwell in
[29:47] you now they had it in this age
[29:50] they had in this age and this age in
[29:51] this age they had the spirit of god if
[29:53] you've got the baptism of the holy ghost
[29:55] you've got the spirit that same spirit
[29:57] that raised up jesus from the dead is
[29:59] living in you today
[30:00] right right all right
[30:03] and if the spirit of him that raised up
[30:04] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[30:07] dwell not just on you but in you
[30:10] you can have the anointing of the
[30:11] baptism of the holy ghost every day you
[30:13] laugh and die and go to hell now that's
[30:14] a direct quote from the prophet
[30:17] all right you gotta have it in you not
[30:18] on you in you right
[30:20] the devil can have it on him
[30:23] anointing one's a 10 time reed
[30:26] brother brown said it's the true
[30:26] anointing of the holy ghost on a false
[30:28] person
[30:32] don't get close
[30:33] and if the spirit of him that raised up
[30:34] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[30:36] raised up christ from the dead shall
[30:38] also quicken your
[30:40] mortal
[30:42] bodies
[30:43] by his spirit that dwell in you when we
[30:45] call for the dead to come out of the
[30:47] ground what paul
[30:50] paul's holy ghost will quicken the body
[30:52] that paul lived in because we do not
[30:53] believe in getting a new body right
[30:56] it's this body made new just like the
[30:58] earth brother brandon preach future home
[31:00] this body is not to be annihilated it's
[31:02] just to be burnt over and made new all
[31:04] right so what brought what paul went in
[31:06] the ground
[31:08] the spirit that raised him up from dead
[31:10] is in the sixth dimension
[31:11] after theophany is going to come back
[31:13] and pick up that human body
[31:15] quicken it change it just like it did
[31:16] out i mean abraham's body and set him
[31:19] right here in this i say this church but
[31:21] you understand what i'm saying the bride
[31:23] where we can see him well that's what's
[31:25] quickening but he didn't know anything
[31:27] about seal
[31:28] he didn't know anything about son of man
[31:29] ministering
[31:32] see he believed in jesus christ that's
[31:34] what put him in the place he was in same
[31:36] way with all these people but you and i
[31:38] have come to a place where we can't
[31:39] throw it to another group
[31:42] we've got to either understand it or
[31:44] we're going to die and somebody else is
[31:45] going to raise us and understand it
[31:47] one point
[31:49] that's my brother
[31:50] none of them had their body no spirit
[31:53] had to be right
[31:55] right but we have body spirit and that
[31:57] body's got to be changed this body's got
[31:59] to be changed
[32:01] so we're going to start on seal number
[32:03] five next sunday morning
[32:06] i hope that wasn't fast for you
