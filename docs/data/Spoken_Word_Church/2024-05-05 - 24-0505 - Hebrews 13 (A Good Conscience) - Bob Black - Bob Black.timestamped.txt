[0:00] amen God bless you Saints excited to be
[0:03] in the house of the Lord this
[0:07] morning just pull up this little first
[0:09] slide I was just thinking about um
[0:11] Hebrews 13:17 and 18 that we were been
[0:14] reading and
[0:16] uh I'm just wait just a
[0:22] second no all right let's go ahead and
[0:24] pray Lord God we're so grateful to be
[0:26] able to gather around your word this
[0:28] morning Lord and as we study these
[0:29] things out out and look into the all the
[0:31] promises that are laid here Lord from
[0:33] from 2,000 years ago Lord Jesus that
[0:35] were written in your word Lord we ask
[0:37] Lord just open it up to us Lord Quicken
[0:39] your word to us Lord and make it real
[0:41] and guide us through your scriptures
[0:42] today I pray God that you'll just be
[0:44] with brother Wade studying and
[0:45] prepareing Lord and open our hearts to
[0:47] today to receive what you have in store
[0:49] for us we pray in your name
[0:52] amen so I I this morning I was you know
[0:56] sometimes when you're when you're
[0:57] studying things out um you you get a
[0:59] little something like 5 minutes before
[1:01] you walk out the door and I just I just
[1:03] threw this into the quotes real quick um
[1:06] because I was thinking uh you think
[1:08] about this statement that Martin Luther
[1:10] made um when he was standing there
[1:13] before the Roman Catholics and
[1:15] everything uh he he said I I you know
[1:18] struggling and praying all the night
[1:20] before when they were asking him to
[1:21] recant all the things that he wrote and
[1:23] he said my conscience is captive to the
[1:26] word of God and you think about what a
[1:27] statement that is that that and he said
[1:29] you know he followed up and said I can I
[1:31] can do no other here I stand I can do no
[1:33] other and so to think about a man that
[1:35] that got to a place where that your
[1:37] conscience your soul down on the inside
[1:39] that you can't he he's thinking well
[1:42] they're going to take my
[1:44] life they're they're you know they're
[1:46] saying all I got to do is is uh just
[1:48] recant and then I can have my life and
[1:51] uh have uh uh things things will be a
[1:54] lot easier but his conscience was
[1:56] captive to the word of God and he could
[1:58] do no other than what the word of God
[2:01] says now that's kind of what we're we're
[2:03] studying on is in Hebrews 13:8 where
[2:05] where Paul's saying pray that we have a
[2:07] good conscience and Hebrews 13:17 says
[2:10] just to set in
[2:12] context I always think it's helpful to
[2:14] read things in context and uh I I was I
[2:18] was meditating there's a Greek word
[2:19] called exag Jesus which means when you
[2:22] study the Bible that's a big word what
[2:24] it means when you study the Bible you
[2:26] don't inject your own ideas into it was
[2:29] which is called ex a Jesus but ex Jesus
[2:32] is where you look at the context and you
[2:34] try to understand the meaning by what
[2:36] the Bible is really saying not not throw
[2:38] in your own your own ideas and your own
[2:40] what you think it means but to look at
[2:43] the context to help interpret what the
[2:45] Bible is saying so to really understand
[2:47] Hebrews 13818 we we need to look at it
[2:50] in the context of what he's saying here
[2:52] in the other scriptures so he saying
[2:54] obey them that have the rule over you
[2:56] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[2:58] your souls says they that must give
[3:00] account that they may do it with joy and
[3:03] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[3:06] for you and then he says in Hebrews
[3:08] 13:18 pray for us for We Trust we have a
[3:12] good conscience and all things willing
[3:15] to live honestly now when you really
[3:17] start studying out the way that brother
[3:19] brandham explains having a good
[3:21] conscience and how he he navigates
[3:23] through that he's a ministers the
[3:24] struggle with where you get to the end
[3:26] of the line where the minister doesn't
[3:27] have a good conscience he said it's
[3:29] always it it's usually those three
[3:31] things money women and popularity that
[3:33] the end of the road will derail you
[3:35] because you uh you now again think about
[3:38] Martin Luther standing there are how's
[3:40] he going to have a good conscience if he
[3:42] wrote all those things that he truly
[3:43] believes in and then recants well same
[3:46] thing with a minister how you going to
[3:47] have a good conscience if you take money
[3:49] instead of standing for the truth or if
[3:51] you if you preach a little bit different
[3:53] or preacher a little bit weaker because
[3:55] you're going to have you're going to g a
[3:56] bigger following or if you're swayed
[3:59] because a lot of people like you or
[4:00] don't like you and the same thing with
[4:03] with with women is is it's and you you
[4:05] can look in uh uh the denominational
[4:08] world and all all sorts of preachers
[4:10] that have fallen because of women and
[4:13] those things derail so many people
[4:15] because and they and they end the end of
[4:16] the road you can't have a good
[4:18] conscience because they instead of
[4:20] sticking with what the word of God Says
[4:22] with what they really believe they get
[4:23] derailed now you think about what a what
[4:26] a con what your conscience really is and
[4:29] and uh it there something about me I'm
[4:32] it takes me I'm I'm a little bit slow
[4:35] kind of getting I have to meditate on
[4:36] things and finally God will speak and
[4:38] just and so that's what I I I try to do
[4:40] when I'm studying on things is try to
[4:42] find the thing that will really kind of
[4:44] get the point across of what the
[4:46] conscience is sometimes it takes me a
[4:48] long time I know some people say they I
[4:49] they can just study for an hour before
[4:51] they bring a message or whatever but
[4:53] sometimes it takes a while but I believe
[4:55] that really the the Clincher of the what
[4:57] your conscience is is is like a red
[4:59] light light a red light green light now
[5:02] now this is how people are when they you
[5:05] know driving a lot of times they'll be
[5:06] at the at the intersection you'll be
[5:08] behind somebody and the and the red
[5:09] light or the red light will be on and
[5:12] somebody behind them especially like if
[5:13] you're in New York City or somewhere
[5:15] they'll they'll get frustrated and start
[5:17] honking why don't you go but the red
[5:20] light says stop you can't go now that
[5:23] God has given us a red light in our
[5:25] heart to tell us when we can go and when
[5:27] we can stop and and when we ignore that
[5:30] red light that's when you start having a
[5:33] problem now so down in your he's giving
[5:36] you that that conscience and if you
[5:38] start ignoring it it'll start it's like
[5:40] your red light it start sinking sinking
[5:42] sinking until it Sears and it just it
[5:45] just doesn't have an effect anymore
[5:47] until brother Rand would say there it's
[5:48] your deathbed if you ignored it and it's
[5:50] just gone it's receded receded receded
[5:53] then all of a sudden it'll come back up
[5:55] again and you realize uh I'm lost and
[5:58] there's your conscience exposing the
[6:00] real the real you because that thing
[6:03] that you've been suppressing all that
[6:04] time now it's come up there at the end
[6:07] so God gives you he gives you a a h a
[6:10] signal to tell you whether you can go or
[6:13] whether you can stop and it's your
[6:15] conscience that if we listen to it it'll
[6:18] it'll guide us all through our
[6:20] life now and of course you think you
[6:23] know we you you you come to the red
[6:25] light you come to the intersection and
[6:27] it might look like you know people
[6:29] walking across the road uh you say well
[6:32] the road's clear there's nothing in
[6:34] there's no I'm going just pull out uh
[6:37] that's how um Esther got in a wreck a
[6:40] while back because somebody somebody ran
[6:42] a red light uh but what years this was
[6:44] years ago it wasn't recent but um you
[6:47] know but the red light is given there
[6:48] for a reason to stop us and keep us to
[6:51] keep us from from harming ourselves now
[6:54] so brother Brown would say and what
[6:56] think you of Christ he said I used to
[6:57] think when I was a little boy and how
[6:59] the first little story and the little
[7:01] girl either that ever told your mother
[7:03] there's a conscience there said don't do
[7:06] this little boy that's wrong don't do
[7:07] that now now I think he's talking about
[7:10] even before you're born
[7:12] again you you know you're just a little
[7:14] kid don't do that that's wrong don't do
[7:17] that you you remember when you smoke
[7:18] that little corn silk cigarette out
[7:20] behind the old fireplace and eat some
[7:21] coffee to keep mother from smelling it
[7:23] on your breath have you been smoking no
[7:26] mama and the conscience begin to say
[7:28] don't do this that's wrong now what what
[7:30] is that that's the red light the red
[7:32] light saying you're not supposed to be
[7:33] doing
[7:35] that and he said see and this this the
[7:37] same quote just continued on she said
[7:39] see then you waade over that and next
[7:42] thing you know you pass by the church
[7:46] you hear the hymns you hear the
[7:47] preaching every red light God flashes
[7:50] before you and you just break the
[7:52] barriers down and go right on don't pay
[7:55] any attention to conscience or nothing
[7:57] else then did God send a person to hell
[8:00] no you sent yourself now now think about
[8:03] what a profound statement that is that
[8:05] he's given something into every the
[8:07] heart of every person like you know you
[8:09] you know you need something you know
[8:11] there's something wrong you know all
[8:12] these kind of things and and and if you
[8:15] step over that if you ignore the red
[8:17] light then that's how you go to hell cuz
[8:20] you ignore the red
[8:22] light you sent yourself that's right you
[8:24] went on your own accord God throws every
[8:27] red light in front of you he could and
[8:28] you just kept moving right on head long
[8:30] you determined to do it and this is same
[8:33] quote continued on he said now there's a
[8:34] red light hanging down here in the city
[8:36] if you run through that red light the
[8:38] city is not responsible for you you did
[8:41] it on your own will that's right so then
[8:44] God has done everything that he can to
[8:47] keep people and to bring them to him and
[8:50] love him and love them so he's give you
[8:53] he give something and every every little
[8:55] child that little signal but then when
[8:58] you get get the Holy Ghost see how it
[9:00] magnify boom now you got the teacher in
[9:02] you to begin teaching you the word now
[9:04] you got God in inside of you but you can
[9:06] still ignore it or listen to it you
[9:08] still it's still that that battle am I
[9:11] going to listen to it or not now now see
[9:14] that's where he's saying that ministers
[9:15] get derailed because instead of instead
[9:17] of staying with the word they'll start
[9:20] going after money women popularity all
[9:22] those thing and that's the same thing
[9:23] with all of us are we going to listen to
[9:25] that conscience or not now now see why
[9:27] are we talking about these things ex of
[9:29] Jesus because we're following Paul
[9:32] through the scripture and Paul is the
[9:34] one that said I want to have a good
[9:36] conscience pray for us that we have a
[9:37] good conscience and Paul is the one that
[9:39] said I want to live honestly now uh well
[9:43] let's just keep going he says so what is
[9:45] the Consciousness he said then the Soul
[9:47] I just laid out these different quotes
[9:49] that I just found throughout the the
[9:50] message and just kind of compile them
[9:52] all here so we can read them briefly and
[9:54] concisely and nicely and neatly he said
[9:57] then the Soul the conscience that once
[9:59] condemn you isn't there anymore and
[10:02] you've gone altogether intellectual so
[10:03] he's defining what that conscience is
[10:05] where it is it's down in your it's the
[10:08] thing that drives you down in the in the
[10:10] the inside of the inside the soul that
[10:12] inside conscience in another quote he
[10:14] said they told her she was wrong that
[10:16] may be telling you same thing tonight
[10:18] she had went to her intellectual parts
[10:20] and believing with her mind that had
[10:22] grieved away that Holy Spirit it didn't
[10:24] speak no more and he's telling a story
[10:27] about the young lady that that I just
[10:28] kept going going and uh until she said
[10:31] things that she shouldn't have said
[10:33] about the gospel and just kept going on
[10:34] until it seared her seared her heart
[10:36] seared her conscience and another place
[10:38] he said your soul will come up and
[10:40] recognize that's the truth and you'll be
[10:42] lost your own conscience will haunt you
[10:44] through eternity when you're having a
[10:46] form of godliness and denying God's word
[10:49] now that's the that's the quote where
[10:51] he's saying you can suppress it and keep
[10:53] pushing it down and ignoring the red
[10:54] light and saying well I'm not going to
[10:56] listen to it until finally there at the
[10:57] end it comes up and
[10:59] it's going to haunt you what's going to
[11:00] haunt you your conscience that you knew
[11:03] you knew you should have done
[11:06] different will haunt you through
[11:08] eternity and look what he's saying the
[11:10] church is pure and another quote he said
[11:13] the church is purged by the Holy Spirit
[11:15] their conscience is seared of doubt and
[11:18] unbelief is taken away now that's what
[11:21] the Holy Ghost can do is instead of of
[11:24] searing you away from listening to the
[11:26] truth but it will sear you away from
[11:27] listening to doubt and and it will
[11:30] change the way you think in so you start
[11:32] going in a different direction now look
[11:33] what he says in God's provided way of
[11:35] fellow approach to Fellowship he said
[11:36] your inner conscience speaks louder than
[11:39] your mouth does you see it's your
[11:41] subconscious on the inside what you
[11:44] really think that's what the Holy Spirit
[11:47] catches and reveals when he's there in
[11:49] the discernment
[11:50] line and the oncoming storm he said now
[11:54] I I this this is something to really
[11:55] Ponder on he's there talking to his wife
[11:58] about how they were they were over there
[11:59] in Finland and and he you know he went
[12:02] over there and and over there they had
[12:04] the where the men could go into the bath
[12:07] houses and these sis these women that
[12:09] would would wash the men they'd get
[12:10] naked and they'd wash them and
[12:11] everything and they're sitting there
[12:13] pondering she's his wife is asking
[12:15] brother R's wife is asking him now these
[12:17] people are Christian people that go to
[12:19] church but yet they don't see anything
[12:21] wrong with a man going to this Bath
[12:24] House of in Finland it's their culture
[12:26] and everything of course they make that
[12:28] as an excuse it's their culture and they
[12:30] they don't see anything wrong with that
[12:31] going in the bath house and letting some
[12:33] woman wash you and you're sitting in
[12:35] there naked what what's what's going on
[12:38] here you ever felt like that you look at
[12:40] how other people act and you're like
[12:43] what what's going on that's now that's
[12:44] the the the the question that a lot of
[12:47] Christians have you're sitting there I'm
[12:49] a Christian and they're a Christian why
[12:52] can they do those things and I can why
[12:56] can they get why do other people why
[12:57] does it seem like other people get away
[12:59] with things but I can't in my heart
[13:03] there's something that just keeps me
[13:04] from doing certain things that other
[13:06] people get away with right now you see
[13:08] we don't we don't uh you that's there
[13:12] you can't go labeling somebody and say
[13:13] Well they're not a Christian but they're
[13:15] in that in that in that PRI in that
[13:17] bedroom moment where brother Bram and
[13:19] his wife are talking they're getting
[13:21] real about some things now listen listen
[13:24] listen to their conversation he said
[13:25] they were FS wonderful people but it's a
[13:27] spirit of the nation
[13:30] wherever you go you find the spirit of a
[13:31] nation and you come to America you've
[13:34] really had it then that's the worst of
[13:35] all and my wife said to me see now
[13:37] they're talking about the finlands now
[13:39] they're talking about
[13:40] Americans I I you go to Dollywood they
[13:43] got the American flag flying behind them
[13:45] and they they say that they're real
[13:46] Christians and everything but why can
[13:48] they do things that I
[13:50] can't and my wife said to me why those
[13:53] people go to church and I've often
[13:55] wondered why it didn't condemn their
[13:57] conscience
[13:59] I said my dear wife let me tell you they
[14:01] are
[14:02] Americans she saidwell why aren't we I
[14:05] said no I said we just live here but
[14:09] we've been born from above the holy
[14:13] spirit of God come upon us now you see
[14:17] now there's the real attitude of the
[14:18] Christian he's not de christianizing
[14:20] nobody he's saying listen in other words
[14:23] where're I'm going on with my Jesus like
[14:26] nobody else is my God I know what God
[14:28] has revealed to me me and I'm going on
[14:30] I've got my own conscience I've got my
[14:32] own guide book in my heart that's
[14:35] guiding me to the truth and I'm going on
[14:38] just the same that's pretty much what
[14:39] he's saying now look you're and so now
[14:41] you got the holy ghost in your life that
[14:44] see that's where you get a bad
[14:46] conscience is if you if you're if you
[14:48] down in your heart the Holy Ghost is
[14:50] telling you not to go to some bath house
[14:52] and let some woman wash you and you do
[14:55] it anyway now you you're doing contrary
[14:57] to your conscience if you know know
[14:59] better than to drink alcohol or do
[15:01] something and you know better and you do
[15:02] it anyway then now now you got a bad
[15:05] conscience cuz there's something that
[15:07] God has given you down in your heart to
[15:09] guide you and keep you from the things
[15:11] that will cause you grief and
[15:13] frustration now that's why uh so what is
[15:16] what is a good conscience now I we've of
[15:18] heard the story of brother Brown talking
[15:20] about how that the little Dove would you
[15:22] do something wrong and it just go to
[15:23] like fly out on the limb or something
[15:24] just kind of that that special anointing
[15:27] that presence that that that kind of
[15:29] confirmation God God's approving my life
[15:31] right now he'll leave you cuz
[15:33] something's grieving him and so your
[15:36] your conscience is your you're a
[15:37] person's overall State we'll say we got
[15:39] moral in there but are are you are you
[15:41] born again or not and it's their sense
[15:44] of living in accordance with God's will
[15:46] cuz now even after you're born again you
[15:48] can still mess up you can still do
[15:50] something you you knew better than that
[15:52] right and you mess up and you kind of go
[15:54] off so that's why in Ephesians 4:29 it
[15:58] says let no corrupt communication
[16:00] proceed out of your mouth now don't
[16:02] speak evil about somebody don't curse
[16:04] we're not supposed to be cursing and
[16:06] don't don't say anything wrong but that
[16:08] which is good to the use of edifying
[16:10] that they may Minister Grace under the
[16:12] hearers why a grieve not the holy spirit
[16:16] of God because you can grieve the Holy
[16:19] Spirit that's what we're talking about
[16:21] getting a bad
[16:22] conscience in Acts 24:16 I'm just going
[16:25] to run through some scriptures here
[16:26] briefly about having a good conscience
[16:28] here in do I exercise myself Paul said
[16:31] to have always a conscience void of
[16:34] offense toward God and toward men now
[16:37] that's what our goal is right to have a
[16:38] a conscience where we're not where
[16:40] there's nothing between us and God
[16:42] there's nothing between us and my
[16:44] brother or my sister that everything is
[16:46] just working in one Accord and in 1
[16:48] Timothy 1:5 says now the end of the
[16:50] Commandment the summation of the whole
[16:52] thing is Charity to love out of a pure
[16:54] heart and of a good conscience and of
[16:57] faith unfeigned in 1 Peter 3:16 he said
[17:00] having a good conscience that whereas
[17:03] they speak evil of you as of evildoers
[17:05] they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
[17:07] your good conversation in Christ now
[17:10] that's a testimony now that it can they
[17:12] can somebody can speak evil of you but
[17:14] still be ashamed because of how good
[17:16] your life is in 1 Timothy 3:9 it says
[17:20] holding the mystery of the faith and a
[17:22] pure conscience and 1 Peter 21:19 says
[17:25] for this is thankworthy if a man for
[17:29] conscience toward God and your grief
[17:31] suffering
[17:33] wrongfully now that's that's certainly a
[17:35] picture of Martin Luther standing there
[17:37] willing to suffer grief willing to
[17:40] endure that night before in agony and
[17:42] prayer and suffering and everything
[17:44] because for his conscience sake because
[17:46] he knew that those things that he had
[17:48] written in those books were true and he
[17:50] wasn't going to stand up there and say
[17:51] well I recant I'm going to go in a
[17:53] different direction but his conscience
[17:54] was held captive to the word of God so
[17:57] we kind of looked at obedience signs of
[17:59] a good conscience say how do you know
[18:01] your your conscience is right if you're
[18:03] doing what the word says if if you if
[18:06] you know that you're supposed to be
[18:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[18:09] Christ and you can't find any evidence
[18:11] of anybody being baptized in the name of
[18:13] and in in some kind of trinitarian idea
[18:15] and your conscience is H captive of that
[18:16] you'll go through with it and you'll go
[18:18] down into the water and be baptized
[18:20] according to how the Bible says and
[18:22] that's the what what brother rown said
[18:23] your your your your your baptism when
[18:25] you go down it's you're it's an evidence
[18:27] that going down in the water is an
[18:29] Evidence of a good conscience your
[18:32] conscience is correct you're doing it
[18:34] according to what the scripture says and
[18:37] and you do those things when you when
[18:38] you when you look at the scripture and
[18:40] you're looking at what God's word says
[18:42] and you're coming with a repentant heart
[18:44] now that that's what will take away all
[18:46] your guilt and all your shame a good
[18:49] conscience will unburden you from a
[18:50] sense of guilt or shame or
[18:52] wrongdoing and and how do you maintain a
[18:55] good conscience you got to listen to the
[18:57] red light listen to that red light in
[19:00] your heart it's maintained by being
[19:03] responsive to that Holy Ghost down in
[19:05] your heart that discerns right and wrong
[19:08] now brother R would say in Revelation
[19:10] chapter 4 he said some people say it it
[19:13] don't condemn me to wear short hair the
[19:16] women it don't condemn me to wear
[19:18] manicure or makeups or whatever it is it
[19:21] don't condemn me to go to dances it
[19:23] don't condemn me to tell a little white
[19:25] lie it don't condemn me to play bridge
[19:28] in my Bridge party you never have a
[19:30] conversation with that I used to have
[19:32] before Zach and Esther got got filled
[19:34] with the Holy Ghost I have we have
[19:35] conversations like that all the time I
[19:37] don't understand why you got to do such
[19:39] and such and it's like talking to you
[19:42] know if if you don't have the teacher in
[19:44] your heart see see that something
[19:46] changes when you get the New Birth when
[19:48] you get the new birth you're going to
[19:49] have a different conversation because
[19:51] before it's just an argument I don't
[19:53] understand why we got to dress a certain
[19:55] way I don't understand why it's so
[19:56] important you know you you it's like
[19:58] you're battling with something but then
[20:01] when you get the Holy Ghost that's
[20:02] that's what what he's saying there I
[20:03] don't understand why people it's wrong
[20:06] to wear manicure makeups and all this
[20:08] kind of stuff he said no you know why
[20:10] you ain't got nothing to condemn that
[20:12] don't hurt my conscience you got no more
[20:14] conscience than a snake has hips so you
[20:17] just you ain't got no conscience there
[20:19] ain't nothing there to hurt you you're
[20:21] of the world now that goes back to the
[20:22] Finnish and the American Spirit why do
[20:26] people act a different way
[20:29] why why is it it seems like some people
[20:31] can get away with things and others
[20:34] can't the fact of the matter is now I I
[20:37] know I know it's kind of y'all wake up
[20:39] just for a second the the fact of the
[20:42] matter is some people are just lacking
[20:44] something some that thing down in the
[20:46] heart that that tells you that
[20:48] something's wrong to do right and and
[20:51] you know you could you want to just kind
[20:52] of grab somebody by the little pill and
[20:54] shake them and say that's wrong but what
[20:56] what we what we really need is the that
[20:58] teacher in our heart to tell us that
[21:01] that something's wrong or right we were
[21:03] standing out there in the parking lot
[21:04] last Sunday talking about what how do
[21:06] you know what music is right or wrong
[21:09] well you know you could argue all day
[21:10] long whether a particular song is right
[21:12] or wrong or whatever but you know when
[21:14] you get the Holy Ghost it'll tell it'll
[21:16] tell you how long your dress needs to be
[21:18] it'll tell you how long your hair needs
[21:19] to be and whether you need to cut it or
[21:21] not it'll tell you those things it'll
[21:23] lay it out because it's the conscience
[21:25] inside of your heart that wants to go
[21:27] align itself with the word and it'll
[21:29] tell you it'll tell you that's right it
[21:31] speaks so brother R said I challenge you
[21:34] to let Jesus Christ come in here and try
[21:36] to do it one time think about that I
[21:39] challenge you to let Jesus Christ get in
[21:41] your heart one time and then try to wear
[21:43] makeup and then try to look like the
[21:46] world CU once once Christ comes in that
[21:50] changes everything it changes because
[21:53] now you got you got you got a real a
[21:56] real red light stoplight whatever to to
[21:58] to um to to guide you and he said
[22:00] brother you'll be so condemned you'll
[22:02] back off and shake your head from that
[22:04] thing just as certain as I'm standing
[22:06] here C he's holy listen I'm quoting the
[22:10] scripture if you love them things that's
[22:11] the world that things of the world is
[22:13] because the love of God is not even in
[22:16] you and questions and answers he said
[22:18] say say well I believe on the Lord I
[22:20] don't have condemn my it don't condemn
[22:21] my conscience no other no wonder you
[22:24] haven't got nothing to condemn right
[22:27] they say well dancing don't hurt me
[22:28] drinking a little sociable drink
[22:29] wouldn't hurt me because there's nothing
[22:32] in there to hurt telling dirty jokes
[22:34] wouldn't bother me because why there's
[22:37] nothing in there it'll hurt now now see
[22:39] you you know you hear somebody just kind
[22:41] of blurred out a little some little
[22:42] nasty little joke or something just just
[22:44] like what and you wonder you wonder all
[22:48] sorts of things but listen as for me in
[22:50] my house we're going to try to be holy
[22:53] we're going to try to line up according
[22:54] to the words cuz I got I got a red light
[22:56] and we you got to you got to line up to
[22:59] that and questions and answers brother R
[23:01] said someone said not long ago said
[23:03] brother Randon we don't need anybody to
[23:05] teach us when the Holy Ghost comes we
[23:07] don't need anybody to teach said the
[23:09] Bible says you don't need teaching I
[23:10] said then why did the Holy Spirit set in
[23:12] the church teachers see he set the
[23:14] church in order we got to have teachers
[23:16] but you ought to have don't have to
[23:17] teach you saying now listen what he's
[23:19] saying it don't have to you don't need a
[23:21] teacher to teach you Thou shalt not
[23:24] commit adultery Thou shalt not swear you
[23:28] need a teacher to teach you to bring you
[23:30] up the statue of a perfect man and so
[23:32] forth but you don't need a teacher to
[23:35] tell you not to commit adultery and not
[23:38] to cuss you don't need a teacher for
[23:41] that you already know that your very
[23:45] conscience of the Holy Spirit tells you
[23:47] it's wrong to do that your very
[23:51] conscience tells you it's wrong to do
[23:53] that so what's a good conscience your
[23:56] conscience is it's leading you like on
[23:59] the on the left we got this path of
[24:00] things that in the darkness that'll grab
[24:02] you and take you over that way on the
[24:03] right clear a clear and a sound mind and
[24:06] you're you're walking through life now
[24:09] now see this is the the kind of the
[24:10] picture that brother Brown's painting
[24:12] for us you start off on that journey and
[24:15] we're trying to maintain a clear good
[24:17] conscience and not get derailed by
[24:20] something not get derail not pulled off
[24:23] like using a minister for example pulled
[24:25] off the path by money and women and
[24:28] popularity CU there's where your
[24:30] conscience gets snared up and it's it's
[24:32] going to mess you up now brother R said
[24:35] I and I perceive that thou art a prophet
[24:37] and I got like two minutes so we're
[24:38] going to wind up on this he said if I
[24:40] never see you again I have to say that
[24:41] I've tried to be honest before people
[24:43] and before God now that's what Paul's
[24:45] talking about that's the scripture that
[24:46] we're laboring on to be honest he said
[24:49] meetings I realize there's been so much
[24:51] pressure put on meetings for money and
[24:53] if that is something that ought not to
[24:55] be done I found three things that hurts
[24:57] ministers first first his money then
[24:59] popularity when he begins to think he's
[25:02] something then that's when he's on his
[25:05] Road out now you think how simple it is
[25:08] to get derailed you start finding out
[25:11] that people like you or don't like you
[25:14] and it derails you because you start
[25:15] putting your confidence in those things
[25:17] instead of the word of God I I we my
[25:20] wife and I take a we we walk a lot of
[25:22] times in the evenings and we walk by
[25:23] this giant church and every time I'm
[25:25] just like wow this look all these people
[25:28] people going to this church yet uh the
[25:29] other day we were in a church for a
[25:32] little um for a recital and and and it
[25:35] was we were just looking around at this
[25:37] big church and how beautiful it looks
[25:39] and everything and and you got all these
[25:41] people attracted to it and they and what
[25:44] it is is they've changed their teaching
[25:46] to attract a lot of attention a lot of
[25:48] people and there's where you get
[25:50] derailed right popular popularity or
[25:54] money money where what if what if
[25:56] somebody offered you and and I'm using
[25:59] real examples
[26:01] here a lot of money to go preach at a
[26:03] certain Church where God might be
[26:05] calling you to preach at a little small
[26:07] little church where somebody can really
[26:09] get the Holy Ghost but you're swayed by
[26:11] the money see where the Love of Money
[26:13] becomes the root of all evil somebody
[26:15] might dangle a big old money bag in
[26:17] front of your face and say well I'll
[26:18] give you a bunch of money if you'll just
[26:19] do this and then you don't have a good
[26:22] conscience anymore you've given it all
[26:24] away instead of staying right with the
[26:26] word of God and I'm running out of time
[26:29] so we'll just stop there I hope this was
[26:30] a blessing to you God bless you
[26:34] [Applause]
