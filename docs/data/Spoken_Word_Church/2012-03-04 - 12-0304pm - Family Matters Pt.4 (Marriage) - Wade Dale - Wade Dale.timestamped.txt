[8:55] something Lord for the people that truly
[8:58] we would be Lord one with you father
[9:01] that we would be closer to you that we
[9:04] would be closer to our spouse closer to
[9:06] our children closer to all individuals

[9:11] closer together in you father we ask you
[9:13] to forgive us of our sins and our many
[9:15] mistakes that we make Lord just bless us

[9:19] furth of this service Lord you be Lord

[10:13] a couple weeks to visit his his daughter
[10:15] he had that planned already so let's
[10:16] just pray that the Lord will make that
[10:18] thing heal so fast and and no infection
[10:21] and and that he will be um that he'll be

[10:25] California so we just pray that uh that
[10:28] the Lord will bless each and every every
[10:29] one of you all right let's read in First
[10:31] Peter 3 in like manner let wives be
[10:34] subject to their own husbands so that if
[10:38] some are disobedient to the word they
[10:40] may without a word be gained through the
[10:42] conduct of their wives having seen your
[10:45] conduct chased with
[10:47] fear whose decorations let it not be
[10:50] that external one of braiding of hair
[10:52] and putting on of gold chains or wearing
[10:54] of apparel but decorate the hidden man
[10:57] of the heart with what is
[10:59] Incorruptible a Meek and quiet Spirit
[11:02] which is very precious in the sight of
[11:04] God for thus formly also those holy
[11:07] women who hoped in God adorned
[11:09] themselves being subject to their own
[11:11] husbands as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling
[11:14] him Lord whose children you are become
[11:16] doing good and not fearing any Terror in
[11:19] like manner husbands dwell according to
[11:21] knowledge with the female as the weaker
[11:23] vessel bestowing honor as being also
[11:26] joint hirs of the gracious Gift of Life
[11:29] in order that your prayers may not be
[11:32] hindered you may be seated in the Lord
[11:34] at his Blessing to the to the reading of
[11:36] the word that was out of the emphatic
[11:38] diglot
[11:40] um it's a neat little read it comes from
[11:44] uh actually probably you need to let a
[11:47] couple of Jehovah Witnesses come into
[11:48] your house cuz they got these yeah ask
[11:51] them for these and then let some ask
[11:52] them to
[11:53] leave
[11:55] so you ain't going to share with them U
[11:58] well they just give me the the book no
[11:59] they just going they ain't going they're
[12:02] going to they're going to leave anyway
[12:04] so I we were starting this morning
[12:06] talking about vows and and you know
[12:08] being co-equal and all that and I I
[12:11] wanted to look up byproduct again and
[12:13] brother dick brought me one which is I
[12:15] had seen it on the book back there but
[12:18] it never dawned on
[12:20] me but a byproduct of gas is diesel fuel
[12:26] for many years before that that's why a
[12:28] diesel motor was created because they
[12:30] had so much diesel fuel they didn't know
[12:31] what to do to get rid of it when when
[12:34] Terence and I first got in chicken
[12:35] business chicken wings were about 5
[12:37] cents a pound or you just throw them
[12:39] away they were like offall they were
[12:41] just like oxtails and pig ears but now
[12:44] you buy them for $2 a pound cuz
[12:46] everybody likes buffalo wings never
[12:49] heard Where the Buffalo came in actually
[12:51] it was in Buffalo New York where that
[12:53] came in but see now the byproduct of
[12:56] that chicken is the wing which is now
[12:58] actually cost more than parts of the
[13:00] chicken they come off of same way with
[13:02] gas and Diesel look at your diesel pump
[13:05] we're at $4 a gallon on diesel and only
[13:07] 360 for gas so a byproduct can really be
[13:10] the same or better all right so that's
[13:13] the same way now don't you sisters get
[13:14] to thinking that
[13:16] you brother that's why I didn't want to
[13:18] say
[13:20] that don't count yourself as diesel
[13:24] fuel all Smoky and oily and all that
[13:29] stuff but just as a okay have a little
[13:34] fun have a little
[13:36] fun byproduct is a secondary product
[13:39] derived from a manufacturing process or
[13:41] chemical reaction it is not the primary
[13:43] product or service being produced Adam
[13:45] on the sixth
[13:47] day but it's a byproduct of that and it
[13:51] can be useful and marketable or it can
[13:53] be considered waste and then there's
[13:55] your uh examples for that but Adam
[13:59] came as a person God fellowship with
[14:03] Adam because God was lonely he
[14:06] fellowship with Adam and because Adam
[14:07] was lonely God said I need to make
[14:09] something for that but creation was over
[14:12] right God couldn't start creating again
[14:15] his creation was ended on the sixth day
[14:17] right he rested on the seventh and in
[14:19] the seventh day we were talking about
[14:21] the Millennium last night in the seventh
[14:23] days where man fell in that rest God
[14:26] took a rest but he took a rib out of
[14:28] Adam made a byproduct called Adam not
[14:32] Eve called Adam and then she was to do
[14:35] what reproduce Adam amen Adam couldn't
[14:38] reproduce Adam by himself Christ can't
[14:41] reproduce Christ by himself Christ needs
[14:43] you and
[14:44] I I didn't say that he did right amen he
[14:48] did he said he needed us for
[14:50] reproduction right and then we read the
[14:52] quotes about where it was in part of
[14:54] redemption that's what part of
[14:55] redemption is because some woman let's
[14:58] just be honest some woman had to bring
[15:00] you into the world literally bring you
[15:02] into the world so that God could speak
[15:04] to you right
[15:06] amen ever how it happened think of it
[15:11] how your mom and dads came together
[15:13] right your grandparents came together
[15:15] and you don't even know the story of the
[15:17] great great grandparents that God
[15:20] brought from this one to this one and
[15:21] brought them down and and bumped into
[15:23] each other at the at a grocery store
[15:25] somewhere young kids never even seen
[15:27] each other didn't know each other day
[15:29] their life all of a sudden they fall in
[15:31] love they get married and Here Comes
[15:33] Your Dad
[15:34] yeah then your dad does the same thing
[15:36] he meet somebody he's over somewhere off
[15:39] somewhere not even thinking about it and
[15:40] all of a sudden you know you walking
[15:42] down the hallway we football coach one
[15:44] day you walking down your hallway
[15:46] football coach one day and this little
[15:48] girl walks by all
[15:54] right never
[15:57] know actually she she come after
[16:04] me
[16:06] I there a quote to that yeah there a
[16:08] quote to that yes you'll tell I sit
[16:10] online
[16:14] yeah but that's the way it happened I
[16:16] wasn't looking for Jim I had a
[16:18] girlfriend right Janet it was Janet's
[16:21] sister brother how know was that it was
[16:24] Debbie and we just kind of didn't we
[16:27] kind of were friends and didn't really
[16:29] know what we was going to do and then
[16:30] all of a sudden this girl comes into my
[16:33] life from the backside you know nobody I
[16:35] knew and she had to run away from
[16:40] home she had to run away from home she
[16:42] actually jumped out of her mother's
[16:43] house out of a
[16:45] window in Atlanta and her dad and
[16:49] stepmom met her at a at a shaking U
[16:51] taking Shake in uh on South Cob Drive a
[16:55] week later a week later she had lived a
[16:57] week out in the woods and different
[16:59] places but they took her back to Homer
[17:02] well I have never met her if she'd have
[17:04] stayed down there with her mama and
[17:07] maretta so all the things that we got
[17:09] that coming together you Adam and Eve
[17:11] was really easy
[17:18] yeah there really wasn't a
[17:21] choice he didn't have a few to look at
[17:24] to look
[17:25] at but when she came out of him though
[17:28] the what's the first thing he said she
[17:30] is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My
[17:33] Flesh and they commune together in a
[17:37] relationship talking with God the three
[17:40] people God Adam and Eve all right three
[17:45] that's what we were talking about you
[17:46] know the the double Covenant had to come
[17:48] apart had to come I mean everything had
[17:50] to come apart because of the double
[17:52] Covenant in what Eve done by coming out
[17:55] from under her head and done what she
[17:57] did then then woman had to come down
[17:59] under a different a different calling
[18:02] right man's calling and women's calling
[18:04] was right here they were to be co-equal
[18:06] amen but
[18:07] afterwards the double Covenant had to
[18:10] come in and when I do this that doesn't
[18:12] make you're not a door man you're not
[18:15] something lower than
[18:16] man okay cuz we're supposed to hold you
[18:20] back up Christ doesn't kick us around
[18:23] act like doesn't treat us like a doormat
[18:25] right all right he chastens us though
[18:28] amen
[18:29] right sometimes he talks a little Stern
[18:31] to us okay that's not a problem with
[18:34] that amen but when you got this Covenant
[18:37] though you the Covenant is that the male
[18:38] is to be the head well the head's up
[18:40] here and the body's down here all right
[18:42] so the male is the head as a figure head
[18:45] as a part of the body of Christ we all
[18:48] are right here amen so let's don't gloat
[18:50] about this up here because this is Jesus
[18:52] Christ and this is the bride GL but when
[18:56] it said join HS what does that do it
[18:57] brings you right here man brings you
[18:59] right back together right and through
[19:02] female
[19:04] procreation what happened we all got
[19:07] here so let's look at the four loves
[19:09] again just to kind of go back through
[19:12] agap love is the love of God Divine love
[19:15] or perfect love everybody got that that
[19:17] is the new birth eternal life you can
[19:20] call it the logos you can call it the
[19:22] Christ whatever that is the love of God
[19:24] Amen cuz what did he do with that he was
[19:26] totally unselfish with it he gave it to
[19:28] us right he didn't keep it for himself
[19:30] amen remember when you go through
[19:32] charity if you read that charity you
[19:34] read that's what he did to you at your
[19:36] new birth right he gave you those things
[19:39] all right and we may read them in a
[19:41] minute again but filal love is is the
[19:43] love that unfolds from AG love filal
[19:46] love comes down and it's real
[19:48] close I said close it's not AG love
[19:51] but it's close cuz you can love cuz
[19:53] brother B said you know I love you made
[19:55] it so much I just want to pull you
[19:56] inside of it physically he knows you
[19:58] know can't do that but I know what he
[19:59] was doing he was want to commune so much
[20:01] with her till he never wanted her to
[20:03] part away from him he wanted her to be
[20:05] right there up close to him and that's
[20:08] what true love is and I know we kid and
[20:10] joke about you know being in separate
[20:11] places and all that but but boy what a
[20:13] communion when you get back together so
[20:16] that's where the number three comes in
[20:19] so number three is just a part of us
[20:21] human our procreating the thing that we
[20:23] do to to as husband and wife and like I
[20:26] told you before last week
[20:29] that there's only there's only the only
[20:32] way you're supposed to have any kind of
[20:33] sexual relationship for all of us in
[20:35] here even the young ones is to be a
[20:38] husband and a wife amen everything
[20:41] outside of
[20:42] that everything outside of that is
[20:44] either fornication if you're not married
[20:46] or adultery if you are married so that's
[20:48] just pretty cut and dry the only
[20:50] relationship you're supposed to have is
[20:52] with your spouse no other woman no
[20:55] touching No Woman No Kissing No Woman No
[20:57] hugging no woman now see then you say
[20:59] well what about you kiss your momma on
[21:01] the
[21:02] head that's parent child that's story it
[21:06] doesn't hurt for me but I don't kiss
[21:07] mama like I kissed my wife there's ways
[21:10] that we have to look and that's why God
[21:12] that's why God knew we would be living
[21:13] under this people so this is not
[21:15] something we need to sweep under a rug
[21:16] no we need to talk about these things we
[21:18] need to bring these things out there's
[21:20] nothing dirty about sexual relationship
[21:23] between a husband and a wife amen see
[21:27] there's nothing nothing nothing bad
[21:29] about that at all I read you that quote
[21:30] last Sunday where I don't care he said
[21:33] you can be 60 years old or live with a
[21:35] woman for 60 years be married for 60
[21:37] years she's just as pure as from the day
[21:40] that you started and the male too so you
[21:43] see there's what that there's the the
[21:44] problem we have is is it rolls itself on
[21:48] out into lust and all the other things
[21:50] of the world and we get caught up in
[21:52] stuff like that and then storage is a
[21:54] love between family which is a parent to
[21:56] a child or a brother to a sister uh you
[22:00] know I can I can hug Anna and and we're

[23:00] handle life and not have you know not
[23:02] have dumb thoughts about things and not
[23:04] have everything we going to read it in a
[23:06] few minutes to let your conversation be
[23:10] pure we're going to read a few minutes
[23:12] where brother R was talking about
[23:14] sisters going through the change of life
[23:15] how we're supposed to treat the sisters
[23:18] going through the change of life because
[23:20] it totally messes up her whole being
[23:22] well that's something us men don't have
[23:24] to worry about I mean they say that men
[23:26] go through the change but I we go
[23:28] through the chains every
[23:33] day Tyler's going I know
[23:37] that you're only
[23:44] 17 but ain't that right I mean we do we
[23:47] what need to go through the change you
[23:49] change you change a lot but go through
[23:52] it with them
[23:54] yeah go through the change with them
[23:58] don't ever separate yourself from your
[23:59] spouse right amen don't ever don't ever
[24:02] sisters don't you
[24:04] ever ever deny your husband the love
[24:08] that he needs amen
[24:10] sisters brothers same thing am do not
[24:15] deny your spouse the love that they need
[24:17] especially during during hard times cuz
[24:20] we're supposed to love it's easy to love
[24:22] them when everything's going fine right
[24:23] yeah but let a little financial problem
[24:26] come along or let something else come
[24:28] along and you will do what I said this
[24:29] morning about the world the world see
[24:32] the world that's what they that's what
[24:33] they come to love for remember it was
[24:36] sexual desire romantic feelings good
[24:37] looks Financial Security wanting to fit
[24:40] in fear of not getting married or
[24:43] wanting to escape from home yeah all
[24:46] right and that last one that happens to
[24:49] a lot of people especially people around
[24:51] the message they want to escape from
[24:54] home so they'll just find somebody that
[24:55] looks at them and marries them
[24:58] but now let's try to get to the ones
[25:00] that that's not happened to yet now all
[25:02] of us I was thinking about back there a
[25:04] few minutes ago and I'm going to go and
[25:05] bring it out a lot of us you know how
[25:08] many how many I know that Bob and Monica
[25:11] y'all married while you were in the
[25:12] message right y'all married in the Lord
[25:13] I know that for a fact but there a lot
[25:15] of us didn't
[25:17] right Danny GE we didn't I didn't I
[25:21] mean we didn't right so we got to we got
[25:24] to take take that though as that God
[25:27] winked at that
[25:30] he winked at that ignorance of ours but
[25:33] look what it come
[25:36] to consider the end of the conversation
[25:38] consider what happens at the end like I
[25:41] said about uh the brothers and sisters
[25:43] here that their wives or her husbands
[25:45] are not here don't make it be little
[25:48] yourself don't make it ashame but
[25:49] something happened in the past that you
[25:51] didn't pray about right that maybe it
[25:54] wasn't thought out all
[25:56] well but that doesn't mean it can't
[25:58] can't change that does not mean it can't
[26:01] change we pray for all of our spouses
[26:03] and and children and everything else
[26:05] right up to the day that anybody draws
[26:07] her last breath there's always hope amen
[26:10] all right sister Trudy come up to me and
[26:11] shook my hand she said I miss Tom well
[26:13] that's the attitude I want you to have
[26:16] right sitting here by
[26:19] herself she felt that closeness that she
[26:22] should have felt with her husband
[26:23] sitting there beside of her she was
[26:25] feeling that and she said I missed H
[26:27] right that's what she was
[26:29] feeling because what this m this word
[26:31] brings us so close to God and so close
[26:34] to love that we can love them even
[26:35] though they're not sitting beside
[26:36] of we can love them A Million Miles Away
[26:39] 2 million miles away don't matter how
[26:41] far around the earth they are this
[26:43] that's why I said that I read the quote
[26:45] and let's go to that one now number
[26:46] eight the one that we ended on last this
[26:51] morning Hebrews chapter 3 about the only
[26:54] religion and salvation we have in love
[26:56] is amongst the real godly people you
[26:58] know the Bible said that would happen
[27:00] congregation says amen uh-huh you Bible
[27:02] readers I heard you holler amen and you
[27:04] preachers back there that that's right
[27:06] the love would be so far away in the
[27:08] last days why it's tumbled down to that
[27:11] filio OS and all the other ones and it's
[27:13] just got all jumbled up right but even
[27:16] through a prophet God restored
[27:19] everything he tells us how to live and
[27:21] how to do and how to work and how to be
[27:24] how to be a Christian in the most
[27:26] horrible time that ever was on the face
[27:28] of the
[27:29] earth you take Peter and Paul and all
[27:32] them like that he said you bring them
[27:33] into this into this age they'd have
[27:35] problems right cuz they weren't made for
[27:37] this age they didn't have the problems
[27:39] we have they didn't have the daily daily
[27:42] activities that we have to deal with the
[27:45] love would be so far away in the last
[27:46] days the only love there would be left
[27:48] would be between the elect of God's
[27:49] people father would be against mother
[27:51] mother against father children against
[27:53] parents and different ones against each
[27:54] other and the only love would be left
[27:57] would be just for that be that elect
[27:59] just elected the word elect there comes
[28:01] from the word elected God's elected
[28:04] people right and then we started off we
[28:07] kind of talked a little bit about motive
[28:09] and objective I pulled up this just a
[28:11] few minutes ago just for the name for to
[28:14] see what motive is motive is something
[28:16] that causes the person to act in other
[28:18] words the motivation for you to come to
[28:20] church today was you were going to hear
[28:22] from God right so that was your motive
[28:25] and your objective is is you're heading
[28:27] toward something amen amen all right
[28:29] something toward which effort is
[28:31] directed you made an effort to get here
[28:34] all right an aim or a goal or an end of
[28:37] an action the end of my Christianity is
[28:40] going to be going in a Rapture on this
[28:42] earth right on this Earth struggles and
[28:46] Li when we come back there'll be no more
[28:48] struggles right we either pass away or
[28:50] we go up in a Rapture one of the two
[28:52] either way the toils of Life are over
[28:55] right right either way over but it's
[28:59] something that we put our effort and
[29:01] direct our aim and goal that's the same
[29:03] thing with having a excuse me having a a
[29:06] u
[29:08] spouse what is your motive and objective
[29:10] for having the person sitting beside of
[29:12] you what's your motive and objective for
[29:14] dating someone or courting someone or or
[29:17] you know what is that have we lost
[29:21] that I'll be honest the only motive and
[29:25] objective I have objective I had was
[29:28] that June and I were going to be
[29:30] together I couldn't see past any of that
[29:32] cuz I wasn't a
[29:34] Christian but now being a Christian I
[29:36] can see that that there's many things
[29:39] that she does in her life there's many
[29:40] things that I do in my life that tries I
[29:43] said tries tries to protect God and go
[29:46] to a goal toward one solid goal exactly
[29:49] and that's for us to get out of here
[29:51] it's not a goal for us to build this or
[29:53] build that or you know uh yeah it's for
[29:56] us to grow in a relationship yep but her
[29:59] goal as well as mine is to get to
[30:01] heaven right our goal is to get to
[30:05] heaven now now all the other things are
[30:08] superficial but they have to be there
[30:09] that's right raising a family raising
[30:11] the children dealing with problems
[30:13] that's not going to go away right we're
[30:15] not going to get in this bubble and say
[30:17] oh dear lord our motive and objective is
[30:19] to go to heaven so I'm going to sit down
[30:21] and yeah you're going to lose your home
[30:23] you'll lose your cars you'll lose your
[30:25] family no so there's other things
[30:27] there's there's there's there's things
[30:29] that happen around us but we we got to
[30:31] have the same goal and objective though
[30:33] right right see because because let's
[30:35] just use Juni for an example if she was
[30:38] a career-minded person and she wanted to
[30:39] be a banker and she wanted to be in this
[30:42] banking thing and she takes all these
[30:43] banking courses and she becom the bank
[30:45] president and she just that's what
[30:48] happens a lot of times she'll head off
[30:50] in this direction right and I ain't know
[30:53] where with we don't sit around and talk
[30:56] about these things or or think these
[30:57] things over or or do like brother CLA
[31:00] said about about the brother that came
[31:02] to him and I I personally knew the guy
[31:04] he was a preacher there in their Church
[31:07] who was going to take a
[31:10] job making a dollar an hour more but had
[31:14] to work on
[31:16] Sundays well that's only $40 a
[31:19] week Claude paid him $200 every two
[31:22] weeks to preach on Wednesday night yeah
[31:26] right can you add that up
[31:29] the guy was not only losing money he
[31:32] lost his faith cuz he is not even going
[31:33] to church anywhere anymore he just out
[31:35] in the world doing the things of the
[31:36] world because what his motive and
[31:39] objective did not come from his heart
[31:41] his motive and objective came from
[31:43] something he thought up in his head
[31:45] right same way with marriage why are
[31:48] some of you not with your spouses
[31:49] anymore you can name it cuz I you know
[31:51] I'm not hadn't been in that situation
[31:53] and I'm not saying I was no better cuz
[31:55] we've all had our uh what Paul said
[31:57] we've all had past in conversations of
[31:59] the flesh so I Ain't Got You know I'm
[32:01] not no better than anybody that's had 14
[32:03] wives just probably a little more
[32:06] same than the one that had 14 but David
[32:09] had 500 and he was okay with it so but
[32:13] listen we all got to live as human
[32:15] beings even though how spiritual and how
[32:18] anointed we are
[32:20] right when you go home and you get up on
[32:23] Monday
[32:24] morning spirituality is way back here in
[32:28] the back
[32:29] somewhere now maybe for the retired
[32:31] people they can they can build up on
[32:34] that a little bit
[32:36] but but the rest of us that
[32:40] work the rest of us that work s g said
[32:44] the other day she was trying to find
[32:45] said dick told her to holler and come
[32:46] and get her you know if she needed
[32:48] anything said she hollered for about 15
[32:50] minutes finally got up went got her own
[32:51] coffee and and finally found
[32:55] him who was sick
[32:59] who was a sicking in this
[33:01] group she's doing this I don't tell why
[33:07] that but that's
[33:09] life but life's going to come like that
[33:11] I it's comical but you know what it's
[33:13] something that we have to interact with
[33:15] but see the motive and motive and
[33:17] objective even you young people that are
[33:19] just married even us older people that
[33:22] are married our motive and objective
[33:24] should be one thing and that's to be the
[33:25] best Christians we can be right
[33:28] together in Christ okay together cuz you
[33:32] picked her she picked you whichever one
[33:35] and now you have a relationship but you
[33:37] have to come under that double Covenant
[33:39] sisters we're going to get to that
[33:40] Brothers we're going to get to that when
[33:42] we separate the two out that there are
[33:44] things that a woman can and cannot do
[33:46] brother Brown taught us that marriage
[33:48] and divorce things you can and cannot do
[33:50] all right but see if June go back to my
[33:53] point if June set her gold for something
[33:55] else and me set one this way yeah now a
[33:57] lot of you are taking that Dave Ramsey
[33:59] course and and and it's not just all
[34:01] about
[34:03] Finance June and I live a good life we
[34:05] live a good life God's been good to us
[34:07] and and you know we're within about
[34:08] $1,400 of paying off all of our debts so
[34:12] we're doing pretty well especially with
[34:16] losing you know the income that I lost
[34:18] but that's okay it didn't hurt us but
[34:19] what did it do it give us a motive and
[34:22] and an objective down on the earth
[34:25] something to shoot toward cuz you can
[34:26] make goals down here there's no need
[34:27] just say well I'm going to go to high
[34:29] school then I'm going to go get me a job
[34:31] no if you if you really want to go make
[34:32] yourself a goal go to college go to a
[34:35] trade school learn something do
[34:38] something don't just sit around and be
[34:40] nothing all right God's just been good
[34:42] to me he just G me good enough you know
[34:44] good jobs and I was telling ter the
[34:45] other day you know he he's retired there
[34:48] in in his 40s and I just I told him I
[34:50] said well you know what I said I made a
[34:52] good bit of money I said but I wasn't
[34:53] smart with my money I'll admit that I
[34:55] wasn't smart with it and God knew I
[34:57] probably wouldn't
[34:58] control it if I had a lot of it so he
[34:59] didn't never give me any well that's
[35:03] okay Paul didn't didn't God tell Paul
[35:06] said be content was where I got you at
[35:09] be content but if my goal would be to do
[35:11] something else and June's goal would be
[35:13] to do something then in this direction
[35:15] and we didn't talk about it that's why
[35:17] when we come back from that Dave Ramsey
[35:19] course and it didn't just teach us about
[35:21] finance that taught us about
[35:22] communication amen right and for those
[35:25] of you that are going through the class
[35:26] you can shake your head but you know
[35:27] what somewhere you two going to have to
[35:29] get together and you're going to have to
[35:31] make a budget right somewhere you going
[35:33] to have to get together and make a plan
[35:35] you going have to look eyeball to
[35:36] eyeball yeah that's what I told
[35:39] you those of you that don't are not
[35:41] taking it you have any other excuse you
[35:43] want to it's just that you don't like
[35:45] change yeah I don't mind change but you
[35:48] just don't like change boy Ain going to
[35:50] change brother boy I mean really don't
[35:51] it put you together it m Janet it makes
[35:54] you think and you say well that's just
[35:56] carnal got to start something somewhere
[35:58] yeah got to start somewhere at least
[36:00] trying to get on the same track with
[36:01] each other right trying to line
[36:03] something up cuz the Bible does tell you
[36:06] that the borrower is always slave to the
[36:09] lender Bible tells you that so let's try
[36:13] to you know and I know this is it's not
[36:16] a financial seminar but it does help to
[36:20] even if you don't have a lot of money at
[36:22] least you know where it's going at least
[36:24] you know what you're doing with it right
[36:26] and you know what and I have to sit down
[36:28] and we still sit down we don't do it on
[36:29] Fridays anymore cuz we don't get paid on
[36:32] Monday I don't get paid on Monday so we
[36:33] do it on Tuesday we sit down at the
[36:35] table count all of our bills out what we
[36:38] in need and what we owe you know what we
[36:41] have to come face to face when I look at
[36:42] June and I go U we ain't got enough
[36:45] money what did you do with
[36:47] it she's going to say I didn't spend it
[36:50] you did we see there's accountability
[36:53] same thing with God we got to be
[36:55] accountable to him right tells us to
[36:58] come to church he tells us not to do the
[36:59] things of the world he tells us not to
[37:01] not to have things in our house that we
[37:02] shouldn't have not to do this and that
[37:04] and the other and it's not do and those
[37:06] but what do we do back to them back to
[37:08] God we do those things that we do we do
[37:11] them back to God out of what
[37:13] love out of respect and that's what
[37:16] we're going to see with with the woman
[37:18] with the female toward the male when we
[37:20] get into the separation but we got to
[37:21] keep them together cuz we're still in
[37:23] the marriage part of it so motive and
[37:25] objective
[37:28] you know check up every once in a while
[37:29] June and I when we started that course
[37:31] about a year or so ago we started you
[37:34] know at X but we had to kind of redo our
[37:38] goal 6 or eight months down the line cuz
[37:41] things
[37:42] change see God don't change right God
[37:45] doesn't change so we know what that
[37:47] motive and objective should be so we
[37:49] always should have that motive and
[37:50] objective is to be one with God to go
[37:53] back to that Oneness of fellowship with
[37:55] god well under all that is what we're
[37:58] doing now Glory we're heading to that
[38:01] direction so June and I are heading in a
[38:05] direction to pay off all of our bills
[38:07] and be debt free and then our next
[38:10] objective would be is to give more how
[38:13] many ever would like to give more Amen
[38:15] to God and His and to his work but you
[38:17] don't have it to give right Glory why
[38:20] cuz we might we spend it foreverly
[38:22] that's
[38:24] right
[38:25] okay so we're head towards that
[38:28] direction so same way in the in the
[38:30] spiritual when I come to this I thought
[38:32] Lord you know just bring us to a bring
[38:34] us all to an agreement amen where we
[38:36] agree with God not an argument an
[38:38] agreement that we agree with what God is
[38:40] doing cuz we know the message people I
[38:42] was telling brother CL and I were
[38:44] talking the other day and he said this
[38:47] first he said your people don't have an
[38:49] excuse he said every mystery that's in
[38:52] the message he said has been preached
[38:53] correctly in your
[38:56] church so we we don't have an excuse
[38:59] doctrinally but we can ruin that by our
[39:02] conduct out there if that Doctrine
[39:04] doesn't become here it's just lip
[39:06] service it's just we go to Lula and we
[39:09] know all things that's right well the
[39:11] devil knows them
[39:14] too okay and I'll read to you in just a
[39:17] few minutes where brother Brown talks
[39:18] about a
[39:21] mystery all right let's go to
[39:23] number where we at
[39:27] Matthew 22 there you go thank you they
[39:29] were there before I
[39:31] was this is what we read this morning
[39:33] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[39:35] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[39:38] thy soul with all thy mind and this is
[39:40] the first and great commandment right
[39:45] we're going to talk about today
[39:47] spiritual three-dimensional love between
[39:50] Body Spirit and
[39:54] soul now let's pull up my little note
[39:57] here that we're going to read and this
[39:59] will be all on the internet but you can
[40:00] read this this is kind of compiled what
[40:03] we're going to look at but in marriage
[40:04] there must be the same kind of love and
[40:06] unity in Body Spirit and soul that is
[40:08] why God took woman out of man so they
[40:10] could truly be one in marriage man is
[40:13] commanded to love his wife as his own
[40:15] body and indeed they were one being in
[40:18] the beginning the only way that a
[40:20] husband can truly love his wife as his
[40:22] own body if they have that
[40:23] three-dimensional relationship Body
[40:26] Spirit and so all right once again what
[40:29] is important here is that unless the man
[40:30] and woman are truly one in Christ they
[40:33] can never have the kind of true love and
[40:36] fellowship that God intended they may
[40:39] have a unity in body and spirit but
[40:41] without a born again experience you can
[40:43] never have the unit have that unit in
[40:45] their soul right okay so now look let's
[40:49] go back to Ephesians
[40:52] 5 28-31 saw out men to love their wives
[40:59] as their own
[41:02] body he that loveth his
[41:05] wife loveth himself that's right for no
[41:08] man ever hated his own
[41:11] flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it
[41:14] even as the lord of the church for we
[41:16] are members of his
[41:18] body of his
[41:20] what
[41:22] flesh and of his
[41:25] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[41:27] his father mother and shall be joined
[41:29] unto his wife and they too shall
[41:32] be one
[41:34] flesh so it's not just
[41:37] all I kind of I made myself a little
[41:40] note here the world does not have love
[41:42] as we should have we should be the only
[41:44] people in the world that has true love
[41:45] and understands how it works and its
[41:47] effects you hear what I
[41:49] said we're the only people in the world
[41:51] that should have true love and
[41:53] understand how it
[41:54] works and it's effect when it does work
[41:57] right only those born of God have real
[42:00] love because all others are first and
[42:02] second dimensional when you say first
[42:04] and second dimensional what do you mean
[42:06] First Dimension is the flesh right our
[42:08] first
[42:09] Circle second circle is what the spirit
[42:13] third circle is the soul all right so
[42:18] now let's go to 1 John
[42:23] 4 verse 7
[42:29] beloved let us love one another for love
[42:31] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[42:34] born of Goden and knoweth God right
[42:37] that's what takes true love true love to
[42:39] to what you're born again of God and not
[42:42] just to be born again God knoweth th
[42:44] that ongoing knoweth God get to know him
[42:47] and we know how that is and we can say
[42:50] that in the natural let's just be plain
[42:54] that that word no in the in the
[42:57] Testament there I know dick likes it and
[42:59] I do
[43:01] too cuz he said depart from me I never
[43:03] knew you right well God knows everything
[43:06] right God knows everybody but go back to
[43:09] Genesis where Adam knew his wife Eve
[43:11] right in other words they had a
[43:13] relationship all right and not just a
[43:15] relationship of talking to each other no
[43:18] they had an intimate relationship amen
[43:20] you can't become one unless you become
[43:22] intimate right all right so that's what
[43:25] he's saying here but let's apply this
[43:26] also to our lives as human beings but
[43:30] whoever loveth is born of God and
[43:31] knoweth God well hey you know what you
[43:34] know your
[43:35] spouse when you really truly know God
[43:39] Amen you know how your spouse works and
[43:41] you can really truly it won't be that
[43:44] magnet where both ends pops apart it'll
[43:46] be that part where that magnet where
[43:48] they'll stick together so close to where
[43:50] you can't pick them
[43:51] apart but now look May isn't this true
[43:55] worldly marriages are established only
[43:57] has one or two dimensional
[43:59] relationships in a onedimensional union
[44:01] their love may be only a physical
[44:03] attraction outside guy right lust or
[44:08] romance
[44:09] okay a two-dimensional Union includes
[44:12] their Spirit the second realm they now
[44:14] have friendship common interest blah
[44:17] blah blah common interest and they live
[44:19] together and you know and everything's
[44:21] that's what I'm telling you you can do
[44:22] that but they now have friendship common
[44:24] interest only a Christian marriage does
[44:26] all three dimensions come into view
[44:30] giving them a fulfilling relationship
[44:33] all
[44:34] right so you can have a first and second
[44:36] dimensional relationship but do we have
[44:39] the threedimensional
[44:41] relationship but now don't do away with
[44:44] one don't do away with
[44:47] two I'm talking natural don't do away
[44:49] with one don't do away with two cuz it's
[44:52] a part of you but add three right amen
[44:56] add three
[44:58] don't just be one and two one and two
[45:00] will cause divorce and all these other
[45:01] things right but three which brings God
[45:05] to be involved in it actually he should
[45:08] be number one but remember we putting
[45:10] him at the Third Realm I don't want to
[45:12] say God is number three in our life he
[45:14] shouldn't be should be number one right
[45:16] but he is in that Third Realm which is
[45:19] what what I say this morning Faith or
[45:22] doubt right fear or love right one of
[45:26] the two
[45:27] Faith which is love fear which is doubt
[45:30] right CU either love or doubt right
[45:32] brother said either either Faith or
[45:34] doubt love or fear you can say every way
[45:37] you want to in that inner part but in
[45:40] the second realm which is what memory
[45:43] reason see this is where you all get the
[45:45] central stuff memory
[45:48] reason conscious what you think about
[45:51] affection you love with your spirit and
[45:54] Imagination boy before the fall remember
[45:58] what happened but before U Noah what the
[46:01] Bible say the imagination of every man
[46:05] was continually what
[46:08] evil so you better be careful if you
[46:11] don't have that hidden man of the heart
[46:12] or that third one that Third Realm if
[46:14] you don't have it full of God you see
[46:16] what's going to happen and you see that
[46:17] has happened in previous lives of of
[46:20] those that have uh divorces and and
[46:23] separations and and stuff like that and
[46:25] I know I hate to talk about that but
[46:26] it's it's just a truth I mean it's just
[46:28] I'm trying to get to the young kids how
[46:30] many of you can turn around and look at
[46:31] the young kids and say don't do like I
[46:34] did don't please don't do like I did
[46:37] don't do like I did all right like
[46:41] brother rown said remember I told you
[46:42] you know a woman man all of us we can be
[46:45] forgiven for what we did but we can't be
[46:46] justified we can't have our virginity
[46:48] restored right all right but in God I
[46:52] believe if you come in Union with
[46:53] husband and wife and it's a true love
[46:56] and you have God in your life and the
[46:57] new birth and both of you have the new
[46:59] birth then that's what God saw God knew
[47:02] that would happen God knew that would
[47:04] come about if you have all three right
[47:08] right and not be just one and two if you
[47:10] have all three right a nurtured
[47:13] relationship with God then you then yes
[47:16] you can't but you know you can't be
[47:18] forgiven of what you did I mean you be
[47:19] forgiven but you can't be justified and
[47:21] say well I can do no you can't do what
[47:23] you want to do there's certain things
[47:25] that we there's you know it's like in
[47:27] hockey you you have a penalty
[47:29] box well sisters you got put in a
[47:32] penalty box you can't preach up here
[47:33] anymore yeah right because of what
[47:35] happened in the garden but you can be a
[47:36] pastor at home you can be a preacher to
[47:38] the little kids right so guess what the
[47:42] Bible says we'll be priests and
[47:45] Kings is that Revelations 5 when
[47:47] everything's restored back it didn't say
[47:50] Priestess right it said priest and Kings
[47:54] that's right so when June and I walk
[47:57] through Glory God's going to see one
[48:00] right he's not going to see two right
[48:03] he's going to see one she and I are one
[48:07] when he saw Adam and Eve in the Garden
[48:09] of Eden he saw
[48:11] one they were so one he saw one person
[48:14] right okay exactly you and I better
[48:17] realize that with your spouse if if
[48:19] she's your true love we'll get we'll get
[48:20] into this just now in just a
[48:23] second all right the next thing we're
[48:25] going to look at then uh everybody on
[48:27] that um threedimensional you got Body
[48:30] Spirit
[48:32] Soul remember all you keep your memory
[48:34] Reon conscious affection imagination
[48:37] keep your U SE taste still smelling here
[48:40] cuz really i' like to preach on this
[48:42] sometime but your spirit is
[48:44] really that spirit is really where all
[48:47] that filtering comes in and out at right
[48:50] cuz honestly your body is just nothing
[48:53] right it don't have nothing exactly and
[48:56] but for the for the sake of us doing
[48:57] this here you have to say that first
[49:00] realm is what controls you that's where
[49:02] the L that's where it's displayed right
[49:05] but but but we may get into that one day
[49:07] and preach on that Spirit part Daddy I
[49:09] know he said he wanted to preach on the
[49:10] spirit but there's some things in there
[49:11] that that's that middle where you got
[49:14] you got a soul right here you got your
[49:17] flesh right here that thing's the filter
[49:19] on memory reason where we get our
[49:22] trouble at memory what we think of and
[49:24] remember reasoning don't do that in the
[49:27] word of God conscience affection and
[49:29] Imagination that's where the problems
[49:31] are CK spill smelling here is not a
[49:34] problem if that middle guy's right okay
[49:36] I want you everybody to understand that
[49:37] I kind of felt that maybe from the
[49:39] congregation that that somebody was
[49:41] saying what about the spirit that spirit
[49:43] I know that Spirit does that but your
[49:45] body still is there that's right yeah
[49:49] you still got this thing to deal with
[49:50] it's what you look through these eyes
[49:52] with that's right so the first thing is
[49:53] to see when you see something yes see
[49:56] taste feel smelling here here but that
[50:00] middle guy is the one that stands
[50:01] between all that amen and filters it out
[50:04] either way I mean if it's the devil it's
[50:06] the devil all the way through if it's
[50:08] God it's God and the devil still trying
[50:10] to get you right here and this thing is
[50:12] just displaying it right you know it's
[50:15] kind of like the battery in a in a um a
[50:18] little model car you take that little
[50:20] model car and you lay it up on the table
[50:22] and without a battery and a little bitty
[50:23] electrical motor in it that's right
[50:26] don't do nothing exactly right put you a
[50:27] little bitty motor in there yeah
[50:32] motor but it will if you put something
[50:34] in there yes you can't put the battery
[50:37] in there in the car you got to have the
[50:39] battery the motor in the car right all
[50:41] right put the battery
[50:43] in what where the spark comes from the
[50:46] inside guy and then that motor will
[50:49] display what that battery tells it to do
[50:51] well all the car is doing is running
[50:53] because of what's inside of it that's
[50:55] the same way with you and I that's why
[50:56] it takes three does take definitely
[50:58] three dimension of a marriage your body
[51:01] spirit and soul because you can't be you
[51:03] we can't sit here and go here's my body
[51:06] here's my spirit and here's my soul you
[51:08] can't do
[51:10] that take any one of them out in your
[51:13] deadly so they all got to be one that's
[51:17] right three in
[51:19] one this is your unit right here this is
[51:22] the unit but we got to live in this unit
[51:24] as human beings and that's what we're
[51:25] talking about this this time we're
[51:27] talking about human life okay we can
[51:29] talk about being you know being a spirit
[51:31] later on but still that's the motivator
[51:34] the one in here is motivating and then
[51:36] this guy is this is where the the fuel
[51:39] comes from he gets all that well we'll
[51:41] get into that
[51:43] later let's go to the next
[51:46] one
[51:48] love
[51:51] edifies 1 Corinthians
[51:54] 8:1 now as touching things under Idols
[51:57] we know that we all have knowledge
[51:59] knowledge puffeth up but love does what
[52:03] edifies all right Ephesians
[52:09] 4:29 let no corrupt communication
[52:12] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[52:15] is good to the use of edifying and what
[52:17] does the word edifying mean build
[52:20] up build up the problem I see with you
[52:24] and me cuz I got ears to to hear I said
[52:28] you and me is that most of the time
[52:30] we're not building people up we're
[52:33] trying to tear them all down exactly
[52:35] right okay that may hurt everybody's
[52:37] feelings and it hurt mine too just
[52:41] then that's why I've told him a lot of
[52:44] times at work Mark will tell you I tell
[52:45] him look quit talking bad about people
[52:48] don't say stupid don't say them thing
[52:49] let's try to We're All Humans we got
[52:52] feelings and emotions and stuff you let
[52:54] them grow wild go wild you know what you
[52:56] going to have to deal with it sooner or
[52:57] later but now as Christians though as
[53:00] being Christians we should edify each
[53:03] othera right with no
[53:06] stipulation right love edifies right but
[53:11] that which is good let no corrupt
[53:13] communication proceed out of your mouth
[53:16] but that which is good to the use of
[53:19] edifying that it may minister of what
[53:22] Grace unto the people that hear it right
[53:25] not just you but the people that hear it
[53:28] all
[53:30] right let's go to nine we're going to
[53:34] quote number nine
[53:39] hey let me read my quote my let me read
[53:42] my notes here first what we say in love
[53:45] or
[53:46] hatred matters it does y we should never
[53:51] be hurtful we should build up the other
[53:53] one always when a disagreement comes and
[53:56] and it
[53:57] will speak in
[54:01] private keep Family Matters in the
[54:03] family yeah right that's a good key
[54:06] right don't mean you talked about that
[54:09] office work anywhere you you need to go
[54:11] in private if you going to say if you're
[54:13] going to have a private conversation
[54:14] with somebody a disagreement you know
[54:17] what you need to do you need to take it
[54:18] behind closed doors right same way with
[54:21] your
[54:22] spouse don't let me hear you downstairs
[54:25] letting letting in and each other and
[54:26] everybody else listening to you right
[54:28] remember what remember what the old
[54:29] saying
[54:31] is family fights in the backyard amongst
[54:34] ourselves but don't you fight my family
[54:36] in the front yard yeah cuz you got to
[54:38] deal with me right me and my brother may
[54:40] fight in the backyard that's nobody's
[54:41] business but when you get out in the
[54:42] front yard and mess with my brother you
[54:44] going to have to mess with me that's the
[54:46] same way we ought to be with with our
[54:47] spouse listen let's get back down to
[54:50] just read this right
[54:54] here so they brought the fell down and I
[54:57] never felt so sorry for anyone in my
[54:59] life the poor kid standing there now I'm

[55:39] him if they loved each other they said
[55:41] sure So I said well now remember
[55:43] happiness does not consist of how much

[55:50] that's lotted you
[55:54] yeah well now remember happiness does

[59:55] amen we sat down and we adore him and
[59:57] worship him and see love drives us to
[1:00:02] that love drives drives us to that and I
[1:00:06] want you to this is the next
[1:00:08] one let's go to what's the next one guys
[1:00:12] I don't yeah now let me give you a
[1:00:14] background on this in God in Simplicity
[1:00:16] brother brand when he was preaching
[1:00:17] remember the Tabernacle had been set up
[1:00:20] brother Bron preached God in Simplicity
[1:00:21] and then the breach and then the seals
[1:00:23] right well when God in Simplicity when
[1:00:24] he walks out he says I'm a little late
[1:00:27] because I married a couple in the back
[1:00:29] office well that brother that wrote that
[1:00:32] book about courtship and marriage he
[1:00:33] found this guy that he married and his
[1:00:35] name is brother Jim and now brother
[1:00:37] Jim's testimony this is what he said
[1:00:39] brother brandham said to him during that
[1:00:42] ceremony brother Bown told my wife and I
[1:00:44] never to
[1:00:45] argue he said it takes two people to
[1:00:48] argue he said because every time you
[1:00:50] argue you wound the heart remember the
[1:00:52] quote right we talking about breaking
[1:00:54] the oil the heart o breaking it you know
[1:00:57] you can mend it but it'll always be a
[1:00:59] scar every time you argue you wound the
[1:01:02] heart and everybody says it's exactly
[1:01:05] right it might heal but there'll always
[1:01:08] be a scar there and and I'm paraphrasing
[1:01:11] this cuz there was a little a long
[1:01:12] paragraph but the last thing he said he
[1:01:14] told them before they left the door he
[1:01:16] said or left out the door he said never
[1:01:19] argue with one another amen and you can
[1:01:22] see there's one quote I don't have it
[1:01:23] but now was it was in 1963 he said that

[1:01:29] argument never had an argument 1963

[1:04:13] know pretended to be drunk goes in and
[1:04:15] knocks the plate off you know and him
[1:04:17] and his buddy goes around looks through
[1:04:19] the window and she's down there saying
[1:04:21] should Jesus bear the cross alone most
[1:04:23] of you women would be in down there
[1:04:24] going when gets home I'll kill
[1:04:27] him you
[1:04:29] know her whole attitude was that she was
[1:04:32] doing the best she could do with what
[1:04:33] she had right and she started singing a
[1:04:36] pong I told you for those of you that
[1:04:38] weren't here last Sunday I told them I
[1:04:40] said if there ever an argument
[1:04:43] starts just say let's
[1:04:45] pray that'll kill it let's pray and then
[1:04:50] just ask God and you still may have the
[1:04:52] argument but pray and say God help us
[1:04:54] we're humans
[1:04:56] we got a situation here that we don't
[1:04:58] know how to handle she's looking this
[1:04:59] way I'm looking that way just like my
[1:05:01] brother Brown said if she's this way and
[1:05:02] your Nature's this way on a situation
[1:05:05] come
[1:05:07] together because once you come to ain't
[1:05:10] it much better to come to a mutual
[1:05:13] agreement that you both are working
[1:05:15] toward the same thing instead of one
[1:05:16] saying well I'll just you know women say
[1:05:19] well I'll just submit to the husband but
[1:05:21] but but then get on the phone and say
[1:05:23] hey S I really don't want to do this you
[1:05:25] know this nothing nothing I want to do
[1:05:27] but I'm going to do it just cuz he's the
[1:05:28] head no no you're wrong to start with
[1:05:30] right right that's the wrong attitude to
[1:05:32] have you should talk that thing out and
[1:05:34] there should be nothing now listen to me
[1:05:37] there should be nothing going on outside
[1:05:40] of your marriage as far as your married
[1:05:42] life it's nobody else's business right
[1:05:45] it said
[1:05:46] leave your father and mother right and
[1:05:50] cleave to your
[1:05:52] spouse when Jeffrey and Amy is not here
[1:05:54] but I talked to them before we uh did
[1:05:57] the ceremony and I told him I said you
[1:06:00] love each
[1:06:01] other don't worry about nothing
[1:06:04] El because you're bringing two families
[1:06:06] together that don't know each
[1:06:09] other not in that
[1:06:11] way but when you come together you need
[1:06:13] to both of you let it be not let it not
[1:06:16] be arguments between your family
[1:06:19] remember husband and wife you make your
[1:06:22] own way right if we make our bed hard we
[1:06:25] going to lay in it but you know what
[1:06:28] look at that last
[1:06:30] quote be real genuine amen don't be fake
[1:06:35] don't be put
[1:06:36] on you ought to be able like like you
[1:06:39] know brother D said and brother brand
[1:06:41] said many
[1:06:42] times go talk to the people that work
[1:06:44] around
[1:06:47] you CU all of
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:52] brain this is going to be good can I I
[1:06:57] challenge any of you to bring two or
[1:06:58] three of your employees that work close
[1:07:00] to you bring them up here in this pull
[1:07:02] pit and have them testify how you act
[1:07:05] yeah when you're not in church
[1:07:14] yeah I see some of
[1:07:20] you let me be a little more plain let's
[1:07:22] bring your spouse up here yeah
[1:07:26] and say how do he act how does he act
[1:07:29] how does she act or react I told you we
[1:07:32] was going to get right down to where we
[1:07:33] live but you know what that's where it
[1:07:35] all starts let's finish this and we'll
[1:07:37] be done let's go to Genesis
[1:07:40] 268 now we're going to talk about real
[1:07:42] friendship and romance this will be the
[1:07:44] last two things we're going to talk
[1:07:45] about we talked about Fellowship we
[1:07:47] talked about edifying uh getting the
[1:07:50] family I mean getting the husband and
[1:07:51] wife together and talking about things
[1:07:53] but let's get this last part it's real
[1:07:56] friendship I'm talking about real
[1:07:57] friendship not just friendship that you
[1:07:59] have with a buddy of yours I'm talking
[1:08:00] about real friendship look what happened
[1:08:02] in Genesis 268 and it came to pass when
[1:08:05] he had been there a long time that AIX
[1:08:06] King of the Philistines looked out a
[1:08:11] window and saw and behold Isaac was
[1:08:14] sporting with Rebecca and his
[1:08:17] wife and if you read the whole
[1:08:21] thing Isaac didn't like it like his
[1:08:23] daddy
[1:08:25] he went to
[1:08:26] Egypt and told Pharaoh that that was his
[1:08:29] sister right just like Abraham and Sarah
[1:08:33] did but aik looked out the window and
[1:08:36] saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife
[1:08:41] yeah if you keep on reading the whole
[1:08:42] story is he came to realize one thing
[1:08:45] they weren't just
[1:08:49] friends cuz with the way they were
[1:08:50] sporting with each other friends don't
[1:08:53] sport like that
[1:08:56] supposed to supposed
[1:08:58] to the reason I brought that out is is
[1:09:01] because that's what you and I I know
[1:09:02] there's times when you shouldn't do
[1:09:04] things but you know let people know
[1:09:07] that's your wife don't be ashamed of her
[1:09:08] let people know that's your husband if
[1:09:10] you're ashamed of each other and your
[1:09:11] ways you need to get back together go
[1:09:13] back to that little meeting and have
[1:09:14] that little meeting and get to
[1:09:16] understand each other a little bit
[1:09:17] better but Isaac and Rebecca the way
[1:09:19] they acted show the third
[1:09:21] person that they were married yeah all
[1:09:24] right now go to Ecclesiastes 9 and N
[1:09:28] live
[1:09:29] joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest
[1:09:32] all the days of the life in other words
[1:09:35] of your vanity which is your time span
[1:09:37] which he hath given thee unto the son
[1:09:39] all the days of thy vanity for this is
[1:09:41] thy portion in this
[1:09:44] life and in thy labor which thou takest
[1:09:47] Under the Sun live joyfully with the the
[1:09:52] wife you get that out live joyfully with
[1:09:55] the wife whom thou lovest all the days
[1:09:57] of the life of in other words your whole
[1:09:59] your whole life up until the time that
[1:10:02] you pass away or we get out of here in
[1:10:03] the
[1:10:04] Rapture all right let's go to number 12
[1:10:06] we got we're going to read 12
[1:10:09] 13 the law having the shadow look here
[1:10:12] if Eve was that sort I want you to look
[1:10:13] at this I want you to this is a powerful
[1:10:18] quote look at here if Eve was that sort
[1:10:21] of a looking brute every man in the
[1:10:22] world would admire a woman that looked
[1:10:24] dirty and ungod like that but there's
[1:10:27] not a man I don't care who he is but
[1:10:29] what admires a woman that keeps her
[1:10:31] place and is clean and acts nice if he's
[1:10:35] got any streak of man about at all he
[1:10:38] does right so it shows the very strain
[1:10:41] hold on now this is a strain coming all
[1:10:44] the way from Adam and Eve so it shows
[1:10:45] the very strain that Eve was the most
[1:10:47] beautiful thing that ever what that on
[1:10:49] the earth that's right she didn't need
[1:10:51] any Max Factor to fix herself up she had
[1:10:54] it from God that beautiful teeth would
[1:10:56] never turn yellow or fall out and that I
[1:10:58] see her sitting there and her hair
[1:11:00] hanging down there her back and her eyes
[1:11:03] was bright as the stars of Heaven listen
[1:11:06] to this when Adam looked at her it put
[1:11:09] such a shock that still lives in mankind
[1:11:14] amen right from the very
[1:11:16] beginning a beautiful woman now that now
[1:11:19] look take the quote back up
[1:11:23] here clean AC nice he's talking about
[1:11:26] this talking about he ain't talking
[1:11:28] about really Eve he's talking about your
[1:11:31] wife I see her sitting there look when
[1:11:33] Adam looked at her it put such a shot
[1:11:36] that still lives in mankind that's right
[1:11:39] I believe it there she was a beautiful
[1:11:42] species and he picked her up in his arms
[1:11:44] he looked at her and said why she's
[1:11:46] Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone
[1:11:48] and sweethearts when almighty God
[1:11:50] squared them off there and performed the
[1:11:51] marriage
[1:11:52] ceremony and took her by the arm and
[1:11:55] down through Eden he went perfect God's
[1:11:58] children right next
[1:12:02] one time tested memorials and was
[1:12:05] talking about men losing their
[1:12:06] affections for their wives and don't
[1:12:08] love them as they did when they were
[1:12:09] sweetheart shame on you you ought to do
[1:12:12] that you ought to do it she's always
[1:12:14] your sweetheart absolutely that's the
[1:12:17] part she should be and you should treat
[1:12:19] her like that oh never let that little
[1:12:21] honeymoon cease cuz it listen
[1:12:27] oh never let that little honeymoon cease
[1:12:29] cuz it isn't going to in heaven right
[1:12:32] it's going to be just perfectly one
[1:12:35] there that's right it's all looks like
[1:12:37] some woman ought to say Amen to that
[1:12:39] don't
[1:12:40] it you never let me hear you always
[1:12:43] balling women out and talking like

[1:13:59] trials of Life come in that's when you
[1:14:01] got to be so in love that you understand
[1:14:03] one another Now understand means that
[1:14:06] you can't do some of the things that you

[1:14:12] you're disappointed in her she's
[1:14:14] disappointed in you you still understand
[1:14:16] one another all right go to the next
[1:14:19] one number 15
[1:14:25] questions and answers 1964 and you
[1:14:27] husbands to your wives when they're in
[1:14:30] that time of life if you ever if she
[1:14:31] ever was your sweetheart you let her be
[1:14:34] right then cuz she needs you she really
[1:14:36] needs your help she needs somebody to
[1:14:38] help her and understand her talk to her
[1:14:41] take her up in your arms like she was
[1:14:43] your sweetheart and she should be and
[1:14:46] understand her because she's going
[1:14:47] through a time that her entire makeup is
[1:14:49] changing and you must be good to her at
[1:14:53] that time talking about going to the
[1:14:54] change of life now 1 Peter 3 this is
[1:14:58] where we're going to
[1:15:00] begin with next
[1:15:05] Sunday talking about Abraham and Sarah
[1:15:07] but we're going to do the men first so
[1:15:09] you can all go fishing brother Tracy is
[1:15:11] going to take everybody fishing next s
[1:15:14] Sunday morning you know what he told me
[1:15:17] he said you know it doesn't bother me to
[1:15:18] preach on the
[1:15:19] men he said he preaching on the women
[1:15:23] and I thought what is he talking about I
[1:15:24] thought oh yeah when they go home they
[1:15:25] go do I do that is that
[1:15:27] me was he talking about me did I do that
[1:15:30] the man's like oh yeah we do that we say
[1:15:32] oh yeah we do that but the women's like
[1:15:35] oh you was talking about me was he so
[1:15:38] you got to deal with all that you
[1:15:39] husbands when you get home praise the
[1:15:41] Lord first Peter 3 and 6 this is part of
[1:15:43] our scripture that we read when we
[1:15:45] started we're doing
[1:15:47] okay even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:15:50] calling them Lord whose daughters you
[1:15:51] are as long as you do well and are not
[1:15:53] afraid with any amazing
[1:15:55] right likewise your husbands dwell with
[1:15:57] them according to knowledge giving honor
[1:15:58] to the wife as to the weaker vessel and
[1:16:01] as being HS together of the grace of
[1:16:03] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:16:06] now let's go to the very last quote
[1:16:07] thinking man filter
[1:16:10] 1965 oh for the grace of God that he
[1:16:14] would give us listen to this w't you all
[1:16:16] pay attention oh for the grace of God
[1:16:19] that he would give us understanding of
[1:16:21] such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here
[1:16:24] further on down in Ephesians speaking of
[1:16:26] the husband and wife and said this is
[1:16:28] the
[1:16:29] mystery how the woman should be in
[1:16:32] respect to their husband even the second
[1:16:35] place I believe it is the entire Bible
[1:16:36] that reverence was ever spoken to said
[1:16:39] the woman seeing she reverence her
[1:16:40] husband reverence her husband then a
[1:16:42] husband ought
[1:16:44] listen it ain't just a woman reverencing
[1:16:46] the husband he live a hound dog life
[1:16:48] amen no
[1:16:50] sir cuz when we're going to talk about
[1:16:52] the role of the man and woman and the
[1:16:54] and the man is you're still back
[1:16:57] together but we're taking on a separate
[1:16:59] aspect to show the woman being a weaker
[1:17:01] vessel and the male supposed to be the
[1:17:02] head of the house then a husband ought
[1:17:04] to live such a life before his wife that
[1:17:07] his wife could reverence him as a Son of
[1:17:09] God and if he doesn't live that kind of
[1:17:12] life well then of course she wouldn't
[1:17:14] reverence him because she knows what
[1:17:16] he's made of but when it is a man that
[1:17:20] is a that is reverent man reverent and
[1:17:22] clean with his wife and before his
[1:17:24] family family a real servant of God then
[1:17:26] the women children and all should
[1:17:29] respect that servant of God with
[1:17:32] reverence
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:36] woman love your husbands give him
[1:17:39] respect we were talking about you know
[1:17:41] Sarah well I've got a few more quotes in
[1:17:43] here we we'll read next Sunday about
[1:17:45] Sarah obeying Abraham why did she do
[1:17:47] that calling him Lord cuz he acted like
[1:17:52] one that's hard to understand when you
[1:17:54] he give her tried to give her away twice
[1:17:57] and she didn't say nothing about it
[1:17:59] right she didn't go running up like a
[1:18:01] lot of you
[1:18:03] would bless God Pharaoh I'm his
[1:18:06] wife he's
[1:18:09] wrong
[1:18:10] no she trusted
[1:18:13] Abraham that's the only thing I can say
[1:18:16] is that she trusted Abraham she actually
[1:18:18] trusted God but she trusted Abraham in
[1:18:20] what he was doing if not why wouldn't
[1:18:23] you as a human being if you husband was
[1:18:25] getting ready to give you
[1:18:28] away would speak up
[1:18:31] yeah she was submissive to her husband
[1:18:35] but Abraham
[1:18:37] acted the part she wouldn't have called
[1:18:40] him Lord and it would have been put in
[1:18:41] the Eternal Word of God if she called
[1:18:43] him Lord and didn't mean it amen all
[1:18:46] right and mean it so I me you know we
[1:18:49] don't have to go around doing that but
[1:18:52] we are supposed to have a Godly
[1:18:53] reverence and and a
[1:18:55] fear you know what the fear is the fear
[1:18:58] is not that God's going to kill us it's
[1:18:59] that we're that we might do something
[1:19:01] that would affect amen right that's my
[1:19:04] fear I think I got it settled with God
[1:19:08] but my fear is that that I'll Stand in
[1:19:10] your way y that I'll be a stumbling
[1:19:13] block to you guys that's what my fear is
[1:19:16] right cuz Satan can get in and do that
[1:19:18] that's why I always pray I say
[1:19:21] God when you come up for prayer whatever
[1:19:23] you get prayed for is none of my
[1:19:25] business unless you're telling me up
[1:19:26] here none of my business but when I'm
[1:19:29] praying I'm saying Lord don't let me
[1:19:32] stand in the way of them getting healed
[1:19:35] and man things will start rolling in my
[1:19:37] head that the day that happened that I
[1:19:39] should have done this and I should have
[1:19:40] done that and I shouldn't have said this
[1:19:42] and I shouldn't have said that and I
[1:19:43] just say God clear that slate out I'm
[1:19:46] sorry I apologize see I'm up there
[1:19:48] asking for repentance for myself
[1:19:49] actually but see brother bam said that
[1:19:51] your unconfessed sin in the way you act
[1:19:54] right
[1:19:55] you act the way you
[1:19:58] act can hinder somebody getting healed I
[1:20:01] don't want to come up to the day where
[1:20:02] we're going to have a give an account
[1:20:03] not in the day of judgment but the day
[1:20:05] we're going have to give an account and
[1:20:06] they tell me that because Gary Atkins
[1:20:08] has got a a disease that he's got that
[1:20:10] it was my fault that he didn't get
[1:20:12] healed cuz you're going to know it in
[1:20:14] that day in that day God's going to say
[1:20:16] You Hinder the service that this person
[1:20:18] right here should have got healed he's
[1:20:20] going to tell us that cuz that's the
[1:20:22] deeds in the body that we're going to
[1:20:23] have to give an account for God's going
[1:20:25] to tell us our actions what we did
[1:20:28] hindered or
[1:20:30] helped I like what brother CLA said he
[1:20:32] was right when when anybody gets behind
[1:20:34] this pull pit and they preach you the
[1:20:36] true word of God there's a reward for
[1:20:38] that it might just be one person right
[1:20:41] that's right but there's a reward for
[1:20:42] that right just like that sister came up
[1:20:45] to him and said brother clar I've been
[1:20:46] coming to this church for 40 years but
[1:20:49] what you said tonight changed me amen
[1:20:53] that was a revelation of of a mystery
[1:20:56] right that just come to one little
[1:20:58] person and that lady's about 70 how old
[1:21:00] sister J about 75 76 years old hope
[1:21:04] she's not
[1:21:05] listening you'll kill me when I get out
[1:21:07] there but she's pretty she's pretty
[1:21:08] she's 75 or 76 so she's been going
[1:21:11] through life a long time what I'm the
[1:21:13] point I'm trying to make she's been
[1:21:14] going through life a long
[1:21:16] time and there was a mysterious part in
[1:21:19] her life that she couldn't understand
[1:21:20] right and somebody brought something
[1:21:22] over the pull
[1:21:23] pit that she said that changed me or
[1:21:26] unlocked something that I never knew
[1:21:28] that changed the very person that I am
[1:21:31] that's what I want I don't want to I
[1:21:33] don't want to be a hindrance I want to
[1:21:34] be a help to somebody I want to be able
[1:21:37] to somebody to just you know you never
[1:21:39] have to you don't have to come and tell
[1:21:40] me and Pat me on the back but like
[1:21:41] brother Bram said we're all human we
[1:21:43] still like a little pat on the back yeah
[1:21:45] right remember that guy was criticizing
[1:21:47] brother brandham and he said re
[1:21:49] difference in me and you are said you're
[1:21:51] Li you're lying and I'm not
[1:21:55] but let's love

[1:22:26] thing as we act down

[1:28:42] would truly do unto each and every one

[1:29:01] and that's what we all are we're just
[1:29:02] your body we have nothing here to join
[1:29:05] Lord we have nothing in that order we
[1:29:07] just have you and we pray that you would
[1:29:09] just bless each one now forgive our sins
[1:29:12] lead us as we go into the furtherment of
[1:29:14] the service in Jesus name amen Terren
[1:29:18] welcome the brother that's here but we
[1:29:20] still say to him you know uh glad to
[1:29:23] have you we always say when you come
[1:29:25] here one time you're a visitor two times
[1:29:27] you're part of us so we just pray the
[1:29:30] Lord would bless you and and help you
[1:29:32] and guide in each way
[1:29:36] amen father we thank you for this bread
[1:29:38] it was made for this purpose here today
[1:29:40] that we may all partake together and
[1:29:42] Lord it represents your body which was
[1:29:45] broken for each one of us and it's not
[1:29:47] around way for us not just something to
[1:29:50] to throw aside or whatever to do or it's
[1:29:53] in representation of you in your word we
[1:29:57] pray that you would just sanctify the
[1:29:58] bread and the partakers that we may all
[1:30:01] be together as one in you in Jesus
[1:30:09] name it's not
[1:30:11] a not a something where you can just
[1:30:14] order it now right you can go online and
[1:30:17] you can just order a little thing that's
[1:30:20] got a little wafer laying on top it's
[1:30:23] got a little cup communion right you
[1:30:25] just get it order it keep it you know of
[1:30:28] course don't keep it too long because
[1:30:31] yeah it is grape juice yeah it is not
[1:30:33] wine because they don't most of the
[1:30:36] people don't do it that way but right we
[1:30:39] don't believe it that way we'd like to
[1:30:40] the bread supposed to be made today and
[1:30:43] it's supposed to be burned tonight
[1:30:45] before the night's over and finishing up
[1:30:47] you know it's supposed to be burned
[1:30:49] because we're not trying to hold over to
[1:30:51] another day amen we're trying to believe
[1:30:54] in the word for the hour and like the
[1:30:55] Bible says give us this day our daily
[1:30:58] bread you know that's what we're
[1:31:01] Desiring in the
[1:31:03] Lorden to me this is a a a great thing
[1:31:07] because tend to understand like I said
[1:31:10] we used to order it was in the Baptist
[1:31:12] Church we we'd order it and and get it
[1:31:15] they'd send it to us in a little bag and
[1:31:17] we we most of the time the deacons taken
[1:31:21] care of it would like a yearly thing
[1:31:23] that we would do you know and and as we
[1:31:25] would do that whatever bread we had left
[1:31:28] we just take it back and just you know
[1:31:30] put it in the freezer freeze it
[1:31:33] over 3 months later or whenever we took
[1:31:36] the communion we'd go back and we' get
[1:31:38] that bread out and thought it out we we
[1:31:40] do it but I'm not throwing no light at
[1:31:43] nobody right it's not that it's the main
[1:31:47] thing is understanding what it is
[1:31:49] because this is not the body it's just
[1:31:52] in representation
[1:31:54] that's it just represents the body of CH
[1:31:56] it's not not the literal body see and
[1:31:58] that way then we're we're holding it in
[1:32:00] the correct order
[1:32:10] amen father we thank you for this wine
[1:32:12] that's went through the process of aging
[1:32:14] and gets better every day Lord we know
[1:32:17] that it's a type of thy blood which was
[1:32:19] shed for each and every one of us the
[1:32:21] spirit of the Living God here to be able
[1:32:23] to Quicken to us that that we need we
[1:32:26] eat the bread we drink the the little
[1:32:29] wine and it stimulates and makes blood
[1:32:31] cells in our body we thank you for that
[1:32:34] because life only comes through you we
[1:32:36] ask you to just bless the wine and bless
[1:32:38] the partakers that we may all be
[1:32:40] together as one in you in Jesus name
[1:32:52] amen come
[1:32:55] morning I
[1:32:58] walk by the
[1:33:01] river
[1:33:04] our the
[1:33:06] everen
[1:33:09] tree I'll
[1:33:12] carry my cross through the
[1:33:18] midnight
[1:33:20] morning there
[1:33:24] for
[1:33:26] me sometimes I'm
[1:33:30] desp and
[1:33:33] rejected and I
[1:33:36] question oh
[1:33:38] Father
[1:33:41] how then I take one more look at M
[1:33:49] calary and it gives me the
[1:34:01] I some morning between 600 and
[1:34:11] 9:00
[1:34:13] tree I'll
[1:34:16] carry my
[1:34:18] cross through the
[1:34:22] midnight come
[1:34:24] morning is
[1:34:29] glor amen
[1:34:34] amen we've even seen people healed by
[1:34:37] taking the communion that's
[1:34:40] right it is a spiritual amen application
[1:34:44] it's a physical thing that's right if we
[1:34:47] get our mind off the physical and get
[1:34:49] our mind on thinking the
[1:34:52] spiritual and what is what it represents
[1:34:55] yes then there's healing amen AB in that
[1:34:59] there's Deliverance there's all kind of
[1:35:01] things in there for us through all of
[1:35:03] what you can think because it's your
[1:35:05] mind getting your mind in the right
[1:35:06] Channel and your thoughts that were you
[1:35:09] know the the communion then it took Paul
[1:35:14] as I've always said what about all of
[1:35:16] the disciples that walked even with the
[1:35:18] Lord Jesus and and witnessed and and re
[1:35:21] received the the communion and things on
[1:35:24] a they done it you know at least yearly
[1:35:26] on a a thing for the Passover so you
[1:35:30] know in that points but they were not
[1:35:33] chosen that's right to write about it
[1:35:36] and Paul that was one born out a due
[1:35:38] season that's right but he could take
[1:35:41] that Old Testament and he could look at
[1:35:43] them things and he brought out of that
[1:35:46] Old Testament as way was short one time
[1:35:48] he literally brought right out of there
[1:35:50] that they had those things that would
[1:35:51] take place that
[1:35:54] that would represent what we're doing
[1:35:57] right
[1:35:58] here and taking the community so it's
[1:36:01] all into the word it's not something
[1:36:02] outside of the word I'm so glad of that
[1:36:04] that's you know that our our Prophet
[1:36:06] brought us the message to where we can
[1:36:08] see and know the truth that's
[1:36:17] right okay go ahead go we're running one
[1:36:20] down today two three down right praise
[1:36:23] the Lord that absolutely what he's going
[1:36:26] to do I'll just say one word you know
[1:36:29] now listen please if anybody on the
[1:36:31] internet here this don't misunderstand
[1:36:32] what I'm trying to say I was thinking
[1:36:34] while Wade was preaching there and he
[1:36:36] said brother random said it and I
[1:36:37] believe him he said it him and his wife
[1:36:39] never had an
[1:36:41] AR well I believe that
[1:36:45] okay but do you think that they never
[1:36:47] had a difference of an agreement right
[1:36:49] no I don't think so no a lot of dark a
[1:36:53] lot of difference between an argument
[1:36:55] and a difference of an agreement you
[1:36:58] know I mean you know the wife says I I
[1:37:01] want to do it this way the husband says
[1:37:02] I want to do it this
[1:37:05] way that's a difference in agreement
[1:37:08] right but it can develop into an
[1:37:10] argument right but now he said it he
[1:37:12] said he never had an argument all right
[1:37:15] but what about when did she told him
[1:37:17] said okay you know slammed the door
[1:37:19] walked out and left him you know that's
[1:37:21] right and God placed a C on you know for
[1:37:25] doing those things so then when the
[1:37:28] prophet will say
[1:37:30] things I know they won't like the word
[1:37:33] but you got to analyze what he's saying
[1:37:35] that's right you got to be sensible
[1:37:38] right amen hallelujah that's right if he
[1:37:40] said that they never had if you say well
[1:37:42] now did y'all ever have a short word
[1:37:45] sure they'd say yeah did you ever have a
[1:37:48] time you didn't agree with each other he
[1:37:50] said I'm always telling her I love her
[1:37:52] and said she don't believe
[1:37:53] right that's qu that's right but see
[1:37:57] then to think about it that for a
[1:37:59] husband and wife to have a discussion
[1:38:02] about something
[1:38:03] right you know what they want to do here
[1:38:06] or to do there or what out to do thing
[1:38:08] is that an
[1:38:10] argument you now it can develop into an
[1:38:13] argument yes that's it but when it's a
[1:38:16] difference in opinion it's not a an
[1:38:18] argumented thing it's it's different
[1:38:21] right
[1:38:36] let's Aller take
[1:38:46] together you be seated you for a moment
[1:38:48] while get
[1:38:50] ready you know it's something to say
[1:38:52] that when we first started here they we
[1:38:55] would have only
[1:38:57] needed that's right a third of a third
[1:39:00] of one of those trays to Y be able to
[1:39:03] serve
[1:39:04] communion but now you know I would I
[1:39:08] would it get where we had
[1:39:10] to car out the wall we talked about it
[1:39:14] build on everything because we want to
[1:39:17] serve God that's right amen we're not
[1:39:19] going to do it till we have to so we're
[1:39:21] not going to worry about it so we ain't
[1:39:22] going to B buy extra communion Cuts
[1:39:25] already got them we've had them for
[1:39:27] years knowing you'd come one eventually
[1:39:29] right CU we ordered them and I've told
[1:39:31] well while told different people at
[1:39:33] different times even who would come back
[1:39:36] to the church right in the end
[1:39:39] time because I believed it amen and I've
[1:39:42] seen it take place all right and that
[1:39:45] way then you know we just wait brother
[1:39:47] said I don't know how many to be saved
[1:39:48] in that last moment to Rapture the
[1:39:51] church that's right now
[1:39:54] something in it amen I would to God this
[1:39:57] church would be so full until we'd have
[1:39:59] to bust out and cover the whole city of
[1:40:00] Lula as far as to preach the gospel
[1:40:05] to CU that's what we we're looking
[1:40:08] forward toen get the gospel out right
[1:40:11] right let the world hear not trying to
[1:40:14] be a pastor of the world on the internet
[1:40:16] no those people are told you don't ask
[1:40:19] me your
[1:40:20] questions they've even wrote the
[1:40:22] questions don't ask me your question
[1:40:25] sent back to them you ask your pastor or
[1:40:27] you ask the prophet's message right you
[1:40:29] know you know because it's we're not
[1:40:32] trying to do that we're trying to serve
[1:40:33] God am and just be what we can be that's
[1:40:36] right in the body of Christ and then
[1:40:39] help everybody we can amen amen isn't
[1:40:42] that the way we're supposed to be let's
[1:40:43] stand together when read the scriptures
[1:40:45] and then going into the foot
[1:40:48] washing John
[1:40:50] 13:2 and suffer being ended the devil
[1:40:53] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:40:54] his car Simon son to betray him Jesus
[1:40:57] knowing that the father had given all
[1:40:59] things into his hands and that he was
[1:41:00] come from God and went to God he rised
[1:41:03] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:41:05] and took a towel and gted himself after
[1:41:07] that he poured water into a Bas be to
[1:41:09] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[1:41:11] with the towel wherewith he was GED then
[1:41:14] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith
[1:41:16] unto him Lord does thou wash my feet
[1:41:18] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:41:21] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:41:23] know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:41:26] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:41:28] him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[1:41:31] with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord

[1:41:40] wash needeth not saved to wash his feet
[1:41:43] but is clean every wit and you are clean
[1:41:46] but not all now if you notice he didn't

[1:41:49] head Peter was saying you know not only
[1:41:53] feet being wash and do my hands in my
[1:41:55] head to do dirty parts of him God didn't
[1:41:57] mention that he just let that go but he
[1:42:00] talked about you know he don't need to
[1:42:01] wash his feet but he needs to be clean
[1:42:04] every we
[1:42:05] right but they were all clean see cuz
[1:42:08] Judas was still dark for he knew who
[1:42:10] should betray him therefore said he ye
[1:42:13] are not all clean so after he had washed
[1:42:16] their feet and then taken his garments
[1:42:17] and was set down again he sath unto them
