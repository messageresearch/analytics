saturday right all right bible study second saturday for this month all right remember that now to remember then the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday of november and so keep these announcements in mind that the lord would bless if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go to revelation 6 and just we say to all of those that are viewing tonight just welcome uh some of them said they would be connecting on it'll be gone so we pray that the lord will bless you and give you uh a a good vacation and good time for whatever and in all those that are connecting on around the country even to the sister and said i was a mean old dirty dude but anyhow that was all right maybe she used to work dirty because she hadn't seen me she didn't know that part but that's we've all got a good life how that sits i hope you're listening tonight and you can get one too amen let's just pray lord jesus we thank you for all things thank you most of all for your love and your grace and to us because without that where would we be we wouldn't be working out today and lord we pray tonight that you would just come on the scene and help us you give us understanding ears that we may hear and that we may speak what you would bring upon our minds to say to you people and that it would be quickened into our hearts and our lives that we may see ourselves and not look somewhere else and lord we pray that you bless those that are not here and just be with each one remember the sick among us just let your light shine in our hearts as we read your word you come and you speak to us now in jesus name amen amen revelations 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand time to understand now let's go over to revelations six and we'll read verse seven and eight starting on the fourth seal and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that set on him was death and the hell followed with him power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to give the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've getting on over kind of in our studies and and uh you know talking on these things of the seals and things and just remember now what we've tried to bring and we won't get as much to it tonight but we'll the lord within sunday we will get on to trying to tie together some things but i'm trying to hold a point up for you to remember that uh the the seals they are to israel because they take place between revelation are in revelation 6 and then going on into revelations 8 1 for the seventh seal the literal things that take place there are to israel right now we don't want to be there when the sixth seal opens right we don't want to be there when the fifth field open we we don't want to be there for these we'll see sunday we certainly don't want to be there in the opening of the fourth seal when it would terminate in armageddon right so then the literal happening of the seals are to israel but the revealed word is to the bride of jesus christ all right now the revealing of the seals the bringing of the seals that's why you'd say well why did it come in our day because it would bring the mystery of redemption that's right amen and see god sent us a prophet as we'll get back to the end of the message this evening lord willing he sent us a prophet that we would be able to see what these mysteries are to be able to read them and the seals as we'll read one in a minute the probably said it shows what has been what is and what will be to come you know all right then we've studied so far and found out these seals even started back in genesis and worked their way all the way through the bible but the reality of those things the things that that you know the bringing forth of the things that we read under this is coming on over after we get out of here and it will be to israel but what a wonderful thing to be able to stand here and see it before it takes place that's right what about a people that we can stand here in the because of the message of the hour we can go all the way back to genesis and we can see what happened there all right amen we can come all the way through and see what's taking place and we can even go on past our time and see what will happen to israel right and go on to seeing the millennium and how it'll take place and seeing the future home and all of those things while we're still here on earth amen there's a lot of these things that we're speaking of see will be after we get out of here but we can see them while we're here i mean that's that's the part i've been trying to get across to you it's just it's been with me for 40 about 40 years and i've been trying to make that statement and it seems so hard for people because they'll say but but but brother dale i thought we got the seals we do by revelation we get the revelation of the word of god we don't get to tribulation right right right we don't go to the tribulation right but we know that what will take place right because it's been made known to us by the end time profit and that's what we want to we'll get down to the end in a little bit uh of understanding to see the point but we look at it and see the opening of the word right the word being open to you and i am and and you know that that to me is a wonderful thing when we i was talking with somebody there the other day and you know i told them i said you know it's so amazing how the bible is written amen you know it's written for every age that would ever be in the world martin luther could read the bible and he would understand things for his day and time right but he wouldn't understand what we understand but we better not come up with understanding something he didn't understand you know what i mean by the hat you know in other words he'd understand something and then we'd understand something entirely different then we're not talking about the things of his natural life and and the doings that he done we're talking about the message he brought the message of the just shall live by faith that is actually those who learn in revelations the the uh three angels coming across he's bringing it forth as the message upon the earth and what about a wonderful thing that we can stand here and agree with what martin luther said about the just shall live by faith right that's right and we don't have to deny that and we don't have to say as a lot of people in the message say well luther and western them didn't have nothing but if they didn't have nothing then we sure were what are we standing on you know right i mean but the bible is so beautiful and perfect but here we stand in the middle of it being the bride of jesus christ and can understand the whole the whole word of god all the way from the beginning to the ending that's right while we're still here and you know what that's going to do that in itself is going to change you and i to take us out of here see that's why it couldn't happen until the end time that's right we'll read in a minute we read ears about you know his name that said on him was death we'll see the prophet said even to the the line the ox the man even in those days they didn't understand it was dead right but he said it was death from the beginning right right it was death from the beginning but you see it's in the deception and that's what i want us not to do is to be deceived you know and get caught up in the deception of things and just kind of you know well brother dale that he he keeps on about the seals is the israel i've heard all my life they was to the bride well they are the revelation of it is to you and i we we even understand why throwing judgment you certainly don't want to go there do you no but we understand it well because it's been told to us through the opening of the word we see just get the point now of what we've been trying to say and we've been studying up through here and taking that it was the same rider on each one of the horses he changed but the writer the horse changed colors you know representing what would be in that time but it's the same writer the same devil being exposed by the word now i know people don't like me the way i talk but just get what i'm saying and you'll understand it the bible's not revealing the devil that's all right it's revealing jesus christ we just we've read that 37 times because this is the 37th message that i've read revelations 1 1-3 that's the revelation of jesus christ the bible is revealing jesus christ but by revealing christ to you and i it's exposing satan in his tactics and his ways so it's not revealing him he's not something that can be revealed god can be revealed but satan will one day become extinct and totally annihilated yes sir you agree with that the bible says he will well if that's true then how could it be a revelation the revelation of jesus christ is never ending it's exposing satan for what he is and the way he's deceived the people and you remember what we're bringing out sunday that white horse right it didn't just blow up and go out of existence get right on going right yes he got off and got on another horse ready he rode that horse through the bloodline got off to get on the black that red horse is just going right on through the black horse goes right on through and you'll see the reason that that i keep saying that because if that was not sold how would you wind up with the pale horse right because the pale horse would be the white the red the black all mixed together which is governmental powers religious powers and demon powers all mixed together and come out as a pale horse right i was thinking about that the other day and this i'll get back into the message with but we can see the red the black in the things you know the red being the blood and all of the killings and the 68 million being killed you know and more of that but didn't see the black horse to be the dark ages as it come down through you know in time the thousand years of where the the catholics ruled the world all right but then the thing about a pale horse why would it be in symbolic of a pale horse that gives us something to think about a pale horse yeah you say well you mix the white the red the black and you get pale okay all right you mix all of his powers together and you come out but i think it's got a whole lot of deeper meaning to it i believe it's pale because god is going to let us know how it's destroyed this beast will be destroyed this pale horse will be destroyed this system will eventually be destroyed that's right it was not destroyed down through time but it will be destroyed so it's not just stopping on a symbol of a killings or a dark age it's the payloads sickly pale horse it's death right because we'll get to it in a minute but you know death one day will be annihilated yes sir for everybody that's why it's pale i pray another day about i thought lord and i know the symbols and the things the prophet said but that's praying lord why did it wind up a pale i can understand the mixture of the the white the red pack you know and get your colors and whatever you want but why would it wind up paying the lord because you see he's going to destroy this seal is going to show us death right destroyed amen okay so now that's what i'm trying to get to so that maybe make you interested in listening for a while and read what the prophet has to say upon these things now i keep giving this quote back to you go ahead with number one brother anderson i keep bringing this one back because of the purpose that i want to be brought god's mathematics is three but satan's mathematics is four all right so what is he first antichrist white second false prophet red of heaven and earth in purgatory which is black and fourth the beast the pale horse and notice what he says this is the end of the message and i know this will probably be sunday morning but look what he says when he gets to the pale horse if you think we're going to be over there when the seals break you better start reading a lot right if you remember the daniel 70 weeks brother brown said you will miss the seals you'll miss the red dragon you'll miss the casting out and all of the things you'll miss revelations 12. so look what he says satan being kicked out of heaven amen now he goes into the fourth seal satan b-e-i-n-g right being kicked out of heaven right now we get over after a while in the message and read it we go up he comes down right amen we don't want to be there when that beast takes place but we are we've done this the rapture we're in the tribulation period and that's what i've tried to prove to you to show you then if we get time we'll get this scripture revelation 13. but notice when read around with bringing down the the course of the horses when it comes to the fourth the beast the pale horse satan being kicked out of heaven now what causes him to be kicked out of heaven okay so i said you might be interested to keep reading these things and when i keep bringing a quote over and over and over again you better believe that it's got a purpose behind it all right so i keep reading those things and i would go if i were you and i would read if if i don't get to it tonight i would read revelations the 12th chapter and he gives the 13th verse satan being kicked out of heaven then in 13 1-8 he is incarnate in the person of the beast all right when he's kicked out of heaven you remember what i've always told you you can't be the beast until we get out of here that's right right that's right you can't be the beast until you and i leave so maybe it'll start dawning on you that the singles and the literal happening when he's kicked out of heaven we better be the reason he's kicked out right right now because he's kicked out as we go up he is right what a wonderful thing to think about i didn't mean to go this way but that's all right god will allow him to come up there and talk with him right come on that's right he was talking to him in the book of job where have you been they should walk into and from the earth you got an audience with god would you show me where he's ever back in heaven when the bride gets tired so i begin to believe if i was you that maybe she might be and have a part of kicking him out sure i'd consider that point and let that ponder in your mind cause that's the way i do if you wonder how i get things or what comes you know i'll wake up in the night and i'll just be praying and laying there you know i'm just like everybody else and say well lord why is it a pale lord i can understand the white the black i'm the one the red the black but why don't you turn out to be a green or a purple or a yellow or something you're gonna find out we got something to do with this we got something to do with this just don't put us there when the thing starts taking place we're going to be in heaven when armageddon strikes here on earth if we're not in heaven when that happens you better believe you better find you a place to hide and hurry and it won't do you any good that's right that's right back on these things go ahead with number two we've used this a few times i want you to get the point paragraph 194. so i keep giving these backgrounds if you notice a lot of the sc folks the people are out there on the internet they they made some of them don't even have the books you know and brother reed told me years ago he said brother dale remember those people out there don't know what you all know try to back up and cover as much as you can he said i know it's hard to do but because they're watching and then when we get reports like i did the other day from that sister that she just took the message and just tied it together from some of the sermons i'd preached and brought it right down to what i'm talking about maybe she don't sleep you know whatever but listen watch rides a pale horse hurt 194 to four seal on his ride this last ride now there's not another right beast in the field sixth and seventh and there's not another combat beast in the fifth sixth and seventh amen now i'm not saying he won't satan won't be there because he's gonna be in a tribulation to be wiped out and all that i'm just saying there's not another form death is the highest you can go there is no other place to go death is it right there's no court of appeal after death i'm talking about the death of the soul to this right he's on his life right now this is not an hour day that will be on down right it's the seal foretold i'll get to that loading about sunday sometime coach see the church has done gone up when this happens amen and when he becomes the beast the church is done gone well okay now brother dale i agree with you on four five six seven five six film but we're here when the first the seal started in genesis come on and work this way all the way down through and it didn't start in the first church age it started in genesis right where i've been through it with cain and abel and the things prophets told us that the seven seals even spoke up from genesis as it's coming down right and you'll see all of these things as they're taking place is the seal foretold amen but but but i just don't understand because you always and we will read some more work the prophet said we go up revelation 4 1 not single 19 21 what about revelation 10 well what about it we don't have to be over there well revelation 10 you know in the days of the voice of the seventh day yeah and that's the seventh angel is the church age messenger to revelation 3 14. come on right seventh church aids messenger it's just like i've tried to tell you john's up here seeing all this he's writing it he's told to send it to the church read chapter one he's told to send it to the church right that's right he gets over to where he's at into revelations 10 and he's wondering how to work and i get this back to the church that's the key that's why i said it i've checked all of the translations as much as i've got a 26 to see if there was any you know discrepancy partner said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you look right back over and said seventh church agent saw that that would be a prophet that would come and get the word so he rejoices now everything's okay he can write all he wants to see that's what people they don't even think that's right right now we don't have no rights they're going to be christians we forfeited all of them right that's right we have no rights we gave up all of our rights to become christians well i'll tell you what i'm i'm just gonna believe what i want to believe well that's good for you go right here that's word that the people that don't get it you've done been told over and over you can goof off and play around and not believe it and you're going by the grave i'm not de-christianizing you say you're lost i'm just saying you're going by the grave i'll get to do your funeral or somebody will and i may be one of them but somebody will do mine because it's going to take somebody to stand there that's right and see death destroyed remote back by 19 and 60 what nah moving on about 70 anyway he made a statement he said brother dale we need to find out what death is because the only way you can destroy it to find out what it is that's right you know i mean you come up with a disease if they can't figure that disease out and find out what it is they can't hope and have any hopes of getting an antibiotic you know or antidote or whatever to right be able to conquer that right see church it's the day in the hour that we're living that we're wanting to go so fast and that's what everybody in the message want they want something new something every new thing that comes along they want to grab it and run with it well after a while it just runs down right right but somewhere there's a little bride just just taking it day by day and saying don't worry about it right you mean you're not worried brother they're worried yes because of us as human beings yeah we're worried about whether god will keep his word or not oh come on right amen i mean what we've seen in our day and then worry about whether god's going to keep his word right i'm only something wrong with your mentality revelation that's right he will keep his word even said he would send the headstone not upon our merits yeah right that's right but because he promised it right right oh but we're just gonna get goody-goody and get good goodies we go to goody goody until one day we're going goody writing rapture well keep good and all you want to do there's gonna be somebody that stands on the word we'll see death destroyed and you're going to have to be able to laugh at it while it's taking you and carrying you down you know getting old you know what i mean great higher right old age you know right i can well remember when i had a lot darker hair and a lot more of it and a lot of you had some real blackheart see that's death right that's right we're gonna find out what death is one day and it will be annihilated well i know what death is your heart quits beating your heart quits beating that just starts you over on the other side right death is the death of the soul all right that's what i'm trying to get us to see these seals is revealing death but why is it doing it by revealing life life is being revealed you know life you know the internet out there i got my southern way l-i-f-e you know i can't help it and i ain't gonna change it why because i can't go to school and learn how to talk properly so get you a dictionary and an old southern one and if not rightly and i'll tell you what i mean l-i-f-e life is what destroys death right right yes sir the only thing that can the revealed word is you don't think destroy death all right watch as we get on into it but what did we read there he said this rider rides on down he's on his lights right now the beast you know the pale horse and he says now that is not in our day that's right that will be on down it's the seal foretold because see the church has done gone up when this happens watch it now paragraph 202 number three on your notes the second seal look what it says but now in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate revelations 12 13 through there the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what i mean he's incarnate in his people then he's got his people bound by his power the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and be down by it now what does he call believing a lie being damned by denying the word with a form of godliness right right you know that's that that's what's all in churches out there they got i wouldn't go that far stick around a little closer if i just you said they're denying the word no they ain't even never heard it right but look what he says the devil just in a time after christ no satan incarnates himself a type after christ not a type of christ happen after christ following christ if you look back above it you'll see what the key of the whole thing god works his place in the trinity justification incarnate himself in the people with the baptism of the holy ghost when that is fully completed we become the word make flesh and walk off of this earth because of that satan can become the beast because he doesn't know how to do it now right he watches god and followers live stream he doesn't run before he follows live stream who wants so what does it do now look at the next one people would wonder you know i keep reading a lot of these things and you wonder a lot but as it dawned on you yet the reason we go up is we're not going to go through the tribulation that's right that's simple but my language didn't it i have 164 questions and answers i'm 62 now watch it 0 5 27 62. now someone wrote me here not long ago and asked and he said if you do not believe that the church goes through the tribulation period how about revelations 13 how they overcome by the blood of the lamb and their testimony i'm like hey brother around the scripture it looks like it looks like the church is gonna have to go through to be able to be overcome by the blood of the lamb but remember israel must overcome by the blood of the lamb even though she's in the tribulation right but the person asked that question i wonder do you realize that the first three chapters of revelation deals with the church in the church age that's the tribulation period now he's going back up here to answer this right that's the tribulation period not the church age the church raptures and goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation never comes back again until the 19th chapter when it comes with jesus that's right that's in the tribulation period not nothing to do with the church at all after we leave out of here this thing goes into the tribulation period right right okay i'm going to the next this is the feast of the trophies paragraph 36 the three chapter first three chapters in the book of revelation revealed all the happenings unto the church then from the third chapter unto the 19th chapter of revelation there is no more scene in the church the church goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation and returns back at the 19th chapter of revelation the bride and the groom together coming to the earth then from that 19th chapter to the conclusion of the 22nd chapter it's all on the millennium and what will be in the year that is to follow during the 4th of the 19th god is dealing with israel is that enough that's right 4 to the 19th god's dealing with israel yep well what about the fifth foot remember the fifth chapter is in heaven after the rapture while israel is getting the tribulation i just got through preaching on it right sure look at the next one i grab 87 on the fifth seal but the reason it reveals it and i understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the antichrist being revealed notice where does that feel sealed right and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right they're away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and does not return until it comes back with the king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be from genesis to revelation we're going to get to it the minute where the prophet was coming back to preach on what the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end you saw it the bible called it a beast didn't it right his he called that back in the garden the beast seeing that was to be for the church he was revealed by these seals and now watch what takes it see the church age was revealed by the scene but we're not dire the seals are going to israel right now i got the one in here with bro around there asking a question this is the first sealed first thessalonians said yes many times right on over to the last day but church are you listening see then that puts it to work we don't have to go through the triple s right right we're the bride of christ we get the revelation of everything we don't have to go through the tribulation so watch what takes place now go ahead number four you notice there was three a b and c so let's take on it now what's he talking this is back in the second seal now the first he become an antichrist and it couldn't be antichrist only in spirit you become an antichrist in that spiritual command that taught the same thing that the antichrist spirit was doing and then you become a false prophet to the antichrist spirit now what about a man in an organization that's what you said i don't know what you think about it but all right can i inject one right there and that word organization can be in the people around this message right okay said if your pastor won't stay with a word get away from your pastor that's his words you need it right of course busting up churches brother dale nope right doing it like it is amen god's the one that's doing the busting look now finally he becomes a beast now wait we'll get into that after a while see all right and if satan's trinity lace like that satan all the time that's the point when you get satan all the time satan antichrist spirit satan and dry spirit incarnate false prophet who is at satan into a prophets of people preaching their lives and then he becomes the beast they when not a demon that was in that antichrist that's it and what's it but when satan himself he said well now what's he saying that was a demon that was in them false prophets right the bible tells you this read what he's saying he's saying the beast is not a demon come on satan handed out spirit antichrist spirit incarnate false prophet then becomes a basic when not a demon that was in that antichrist that's not what the beast is but when satan himself is kicked out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was where was that in the prophets you remember the other day i talked about it they just elected a a guy over all of them made my pope where the devil was the devil then the devil is incarnate of a man just repeating itself all right sticking next now you remember whatever said it that demon that was in that false prophet is not that beast right that beast is satan that demon was satan yes is one of satan's demons but when it comes to the beast it's the head man the beast is the devil himself because he's kicked out of heaven what we just read after we get out of here watch what he says paragraph 105 for seal and when the laminate open the fourth seal let's stop there now the four seal now who opened it the lamb was anybody else worthy no one else could do it no the lamb opened the fourth seal now get the point and you'll separate the eagle from the lamb the lamb opened the fourth seal you remember in the third seal it was not the combat beast of the third combat beast that said a measure wheat for a penny and a minute of barley touch not the oil and wine that was the lamb himself you remember sunday all right see what's your prophecy the lamb opened the fourth seal and the the fourth beast the living creature like an eagle an hershey key said to john come and see what the fourth mystery right are you reading that all right amen are you reading where i got my finger can you see it from over there i'll they can see it he's not talking about the devil the plan of redemption is not redeeming the devil right man he's not being revealed he's being exposed what available the fourth mystery come on i'm just asking a simple question because what he's saying what is the fourth mystery amen of the plan of redemption come on church was you listening want to go right if we could ever find out how to destroy death it's going to take the fourth mystery to do it and it can only come by the eagle that's right yes sir none of the other ages could call him death right we'll get to that in a minute i'm going to do it sunday one the living creature like an eagle said to john come see what the fourth mystery of the planet redemption has been hid in this book because the lamb was opening it in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here that's what the the combat beast is telling us the lamb is opening it bringing it down there's a forward mystery here i've showed you in symbol well you just see a symbol of the pale art remember in them symbols there's a lot of difference in what you think right go into the opposition of those symbols which we haven't done which we will do probably the next week or so we'll just preach a message of all the way through up to where we are and take both sides but we've been just dealing up until this message dealing with basically speaking about the antichrist false prophet pope etc exposing him but take the symbols of the horse amen in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here i showed you in symbol and john i don't know whether you've understood it or not but he wrote down what he saw but it was a mystery so he wrote what he saw the lamb was breaking the seals and god still wasn't going to reveal it it was left for the last days that's right he was not going to reveal these seals until this day that's right the lies come back because that's basically what you're doing your mind i know it because mine done that until the lord began to break it away and help me to see it you're just looking at seals like a white horse and just finding out what that is right and you get all your symbols you get that down and you say well we got it and then you get a red horse and you say well we that's what we see the red horse and all the symbols we got it then you get a black one and you just see the symbols and we got it now we've come to a secret mystery under the fourth one amen to see that it's revealing jesus christ there's a statement brother man made one day and i've been looking i know i found one but it's close but he said we've talked enough about him what the devil right there we've talked enough about the devil you know the people of this message and i know i'm getting off of them mexican getting down to meddling but the people of this message are glorifying the devil that's what i'm trying to expose that's right amen glorifying the devil come on folks wake up there's some sitting here that know i know what i'm fixing to say and won't say much but you go join up with a certain group and they'll tell they first started out that it had to be a one supreme being now it's only dealing with a supreme being after you go so far it turns from looking at things to magic and you wind up worshiping the devil as your worshipful master okay but you see how easy and deceiving it is we had one brother that when i and i'm not against all of that i don't talk about those things we had one brother and he'd come to him and he said they lied to me i said i didn't beat on him in the hammer about it there's some sitting here i've never said a word to you but he couldn't he said they lied to me it's okay you found it out you found it out true sets you free okay but remember the lamb opened the fourth seal and the fourth living creature like an eagle now you've got an opportunity to be able to see the plan of redemption amen not that it wasn't dire on the others but they were not dealing with that they were dealing with the spirit of the age which was to sacrifice and to hang on and do the best they could and to live for jesus christ even though they died just for saying they were christians read foxy book of martyrs but you see waiting a time that we could understand the prophet unless brother richard wilson was last night waiting for a time that it could be comprehended that's it you know there's no need of god opening this in the first church age there was no need to open it in the second third fourth fifth and sixth there was no need of it because we couldn't comprehend them we're having trouble now right now because of the carnality of our mind and we want to keep rolling back but we're brotherly operating the seals for the bride i got quote quote yeah but are you going to deny the quotes where it says here to israel all right amen that's right and you are going to be in bad shape to think that we're going to be there when the fourth seal opens in armageddon terrible shape to think we're going to be there in the tribulation period no no no we don't believe that but we just don't want we just don't believe what you're talking about i thought i was reading it did i did i lose something somewhere i mean that's why i have page after page i thought i was reading it i thought i was reading what the prophet said that's right yeah but you're just putting it together that's what a brother told me one time he said you ain't nothing but a good baptist he said all you can do is just put the word together in the letter i just screamed that didn't bother me at all i said why did you change your mind he said brother i didn't think you had anything other than a new birth and it was nothing but this was his words he said when god spoke to you about that manifestation of spirits i knew the animal was right okay because that's what people think when they get over the romans you know in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god they think manifest goes out and call for rain and call for this and call for that all that that's wonderful but what about where it says making known right right manifest is to make known right your prophet came to make these things known that's why he was an eagle all right a wonderful position i hope we get down far enough to be able to cover it look at the next one parker at 158. now remember when we just read said it was a mystery the fourth seal is a mystery but then there's a mystery rejection because there was a mystery about the fourth seal it was you know it's just exposing the devil okay then when we find out his mystery here in his church and state the fourth stage of his ministry he's called the beast first he's called the antichrist and it's called false prophet and he's called the beast now we find him here being called as the beast and i want you to notice that after the fourth horse and then this fourth that's to want you to notice that's after the fourth quarter and in this fourth horse if you'll notice all the first one was white and then the next one was red the next one black and the fourth one all of these other three were represented in it is what makes it tail to because pale is red and white and so mixed together see he it's he's all mixed in this one horse and there he becomes four are actually the three and one he was all mixed up in that one thing mixing amen now we're gonna read in a second what he mixes history powers heaven earth purgatory heaven earth and purgatory when he gets a mix together it's going to bring death but we'll find out it was death all alone you know but now what's his other three political power religious power and demon power right when you mix them together what have you got yeah amen that's right right pale horse okay go ahead to the next 136. this is off the power transformation raced in 1965 10 31 the morning when i go home this time i'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and trail him right through the bible and show how he's how he heads up see you all get that on the telephone so if the lord permits it he's going to come and do it the coming of this fellow well now beast at the beginning beast at the end where they're just like judas and jesus they're both brothers in their tribe just like he saw in jacob you know and the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin in this great warfare that we're in the next one trying to do god of service without his will that being god's will america 37 i'm preaching i wouldn't preach it in brother jack's church he'd tell me go ahead and do it but i'm going to the tabernacle it'll be about four hours long and my subject is the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of a serpent see it takes about four hours i got my scriptures all laid out the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden he's the beast at the end and show how he's a religious person and a denomination that made the denomination and come right through the trail of it and prove it to you by the scripture that it is i didn't know that till the holy spirit gave it to me the other day up there that's one of the things of people who believe in the return ministry i believe brother brown has got to come back and preach the trail of the serpent that's one of their thinkings that's fine that's alright i have no problem not told you where i stand but listen you mix up all them colors look to the next now we're back on the fourth seal i got 195. when christ appears here on earth as its fellow appears and becomes completely completely the devil from the head cross all the way down the false prophet into the beast the devil himself and he's riding on a pale horse covered all up and mixed with all kinds of colors to make him pale and deadly right all right pale and deadly going to the next one alright 197 the fourth seal notice the antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color horse is a beast that represents the power his power is all mixed up why it's political it's national powers it's religious powers it's demon powers okay it's all kind of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse was he just got all kind of power do you remember what i was showing you that he couldn't be when it was an antichrist of the spirit he didn't have a crown he had to wait and become a pope well that'd be a pope that connected the government together so constantine brought the government in and that's why they could get bible killing 68 million because the government okay but when jesus comes it's on a one-colored solid colored horse this one mixes the colors of red white black three colors in one represented in one and three powers represented in one white horse a black horse red horse and three crowns in one triple ruling crown over heaven earth and purgatory right come on look at the next thing this is paragraph 310 more sealed and here they're joining themselves together coming to that show down to armageddon i'm not gonna touch armageddon tonight period so don't get your thought running into armageddon we're coming up to that place we will do with that sunday sometime or some sunday let's go down to armageddon and riding on the mixed-colored horse with one horse of white one horse of red one horse of black the three different political of political power spiritual power control but demon powers which is the antichrist mixing that all together you've got a pale sickly looking thing he's right now now here is where our fear comes in and makes us think the wrong thing the bible speaks of the devil there's a man laying in a ditch with no power he's like a drunk that's laying in a ditch the bible describes a map we'll go back to scripture if you need it let's see we're afraid of him we're afraid that he may be powerful more than we think right why would you be afraid of him yeah but look what he's done to people i agree right but you know yourself most others because people volunteering that's right when you take the governments and the things like we've got them today and the government can control everything you're right back to the same situation where they can kill you and they just erase your name right now from all records by just the blood of your name and goes off the computer and you no longer exist and you'll not be able to buy ourselves right that's never been until now never being that the mark of the beast could be made manifest until now those are not jabbers those are facts you can take your name off a record right now and you no longer exist you can go in hard scream all you want to you don't exist look at it sickly looking thing he's riding on sure don't look like a powerful horse does it no that's right so you're looking at it as thinking as some kind of great powerful horse this demon power political power spiritual powers demon powers that's where our trouble is we're looking at them like they have a power the way you're talking they're going to get you brother dale they won't get me until god's through with that that goes out there for them to listen to as well as anything until god gets through with me and if he ain't through with me i got a lot of scripture to stand on when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up the standard man no i think it's wise to be sensible right yeah okay sickly looking thing he's riding on why why did it get up here where you got the white as a great powerful deceptive you've got the red that they could kill by the millions you got the black that represents your dark ages that brought around said no telling how many billion was killed spiritually right right why would it now show him as a pale sickly oh that's just the way it looks i'm glad you said that that's what i'm talking about right the symbol of that seal is a sickly situation that you and i should not have any fear of yeah but look what they can do they can't do nothing till god gets through with it that's right right he didn't worry about that at all why would it call him a horse because now he's come down he looked like he's got everything in the world under his control right political powers even to the their heaven or in purgatory that he's ruler over you can pray them out of hell or bring them out of purgatory do all kind of things got the government behind him and all the political maneuvers amen god says by the eagle you hear me god said by the eagle come and see he's going to show you what this stuff is and how it's going to wind up and be destroyed instead of satan gaining power you think he's got everything in control he's got the governments he's got the religious he's got everything in his control what does that matter right what are you afraid of that's right what are you afraid of jerk i'm serious right a sickly pale looking horse by the eagle that says he has no power by the eagle that tells you what he is the equal contact skip the next one go to number 12. try to cut out a little let's go to 12 click it over questions next you're going to see 63 324 morning service program 199. brother brown does the fur does the first horse rider now listen to him real careful fulfilled second thessalonians the revelation of the man of sin yes that's right that does that easy that does that's the man of sin this same man just keeps in in stages riding on until he gets on a pale horse that's called death christ comes down through justification to the white horse and that's to get life are you listening now he went from seal one to four return a statement from one seal first seal to the fourth seal all together in that one statement that's why they took sealed or not you and i when that man of sin sits in the temple of god to be as god that is the beast which is satan incarnate that's when satan has been cast out because we go up right and he will be here as the devil incarnate and he's called death we'll jump these and go on hang on the smith and i'll give you his number but on program 155 he said he was antichrist he said he was deaf to begin with he's deaf to begin with go to prayer go to number 14. all right 182 the fourth seal now we find out here that this is satan after being kicked out of heaven you'll see why he's sickly he thinks he's got everything under his control amen but he's fixing to be defeated that's right you know why because if we done god up he's already defeated we're going to defeat him here right that's right not in the physical battle right right that's where people ever since i've been in this message minister sat right here and was having a minister to me one day but i always thought we'd come back with him and fight on that revelation 19. i said five you mean we are supernatural eternal beings to fight natural people you just you know he didn't say no more listen church if we don't defeat the devil israel don't have an opportunity this revealed word is going to make it all right here we go all right please now he now he is a beast and a antichrist fox prophet now beast and given the name of death and hell follows him fully satan on this throne now that's after the rapture then we go up because he's kicked out remember he's kicked out because we were on the earth he's satan rep satan he's saving representatives on the earth now he that he now is head of the kingdom of the world the first thing kingdoms we offer to the lord jesus in matthew 4 satan now becomes a full king now this happens later on he's false prophet now he will come become beast after a while when he breaks his covenant there with the jews you know how we've been through that now there's how you understand you down on 70 weeks he breaks his covenant with the israel going to the next one paragraph 192 nobody's satan fully only strong yes sir offered it to god you talk about the world offered it to our lord he is sitting here with his beastly heart in him snake incarnate the devil in a man to become incarnate he's got a beastly heart don't get into that what's his heart over here what did it hurt was it down here you've got a beastly heart not a gizzard now here is the person the beast the incarnate devil he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false prince of the true word oh he associates himself with the word yep that's right are you ready amen when he's cast out he don't come down say i'm the devil no no that's three and a half years of tribulation and then he breaks his covenant with israel at the end of three and a half years until that time he's the good old boy then according to the book of daniel that makes craft to prosper makes all of the things then he comes in like flattery he's a wonderful superman guy under the false pretense one of the true word right in other words they tell me you just got the word he's the one who said john he associated himself with the word and he can call fire down out of heaven that's right amen is that right is that the book of revelation he can do things why because he's satan incarnate we see the little bride's done gone lord my wife was saying the other day on the daniel stephanie see the only people battling him is not the natural jew they're the covenant with him right the only ones that's battling him is 144 000 when they're telling them that ain't right and this boy over here saying get even get rid of them get off take care of that you know what they do they take care of that they kill them then they find out you're done wrong it's going to be chaos to the natural israel right okay his death let's go a little further let me just get this quit off right here i'm gonna go any further we're going too far america two team watch christ first coming he comes immortal to bleed and die is that right that's his first coming the second coming is the rapture we made it undiscovered immortal his third coming he's the incarnate god amen god emmanuel to reign on earth that's right only three okay so satan is following after him becoming incarnate and you and i for a rapture to come then he followers with the beast being incarnate and saying he's god right but you see we've done gone four stages of the writer the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternally separated that's what god calls him and i'll just fold that over and we'll start it right there sunday we know the combat beats the eagle is the one that called him death but what is this if we take into account the last two things we were reading of how that god becomes incarnate in the people in the word and satan becomes incarnate in his people after we get out of here then we should consider one thing i'll review this sunday but why does it say in revelation 6 verse 7-8 verse 8. it doesn't say his name is dead it said it was dead brother brown said his name is death now i want to end in just a minute or something you see what brother dale death is not a name yeah when the bible says it is the prophet says it is i don't care what your english vocabulary thinks about it but i'll remind you in your english vocabulary little now i'm real good in english but i do know how to read a noun is a name of a person place or what or thing so death is a thing it's not a person it's not a place it's a thing you see we look at it we want names laid upon things according to revelation 19 that writer has a name on him which is the word of god you're waking up right loretta says that is jesus i got all that time we know that we know he's his word but just remember he's just as much god when it says jesus he's just as much god when it says in the beginning was the word word god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us brother said translate that now this is his wording he said in the beginning what was elohim he said elohim was with god and elohim was god and elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us well elohim then it's a name right the word forgive me the word is a thing now you really stepped over because the word is a person that's right and it was placed before the foundation of the world and become a thing i want you ashamed to call the word a thing i remember brother years ago we were talking about something and then the bible calls the holy ghost and it you know that you want me to get scripture right the bible calls the holy ghost in it and he didn't like that translation whatsoever he was dogmatic against that part of saying the holy ghost was an idiot i never had no problem with it i didn't have enough education to figure it out i just read it citizen here and i knew what that idea was don't you all right right i've been under the bed this morning thank you now brother said a theologian will turn to this theology every time you have people in this message that are turning and i know one did because he said he did did he relied upon a theologian to help him understand i do too he's one called the holy spirit and he had a man to bring it down called william brown to bring it unto me so if you can see that death is a thing that's a name if you can see that then you can see the word is a person it's jesus christ you don't have to rewrite the bible just understand the mechanical side of it we get to it sunday it took the eagle to name it death the others looked at it as a deceptive form of different things and couldn't follow it true as even john on batman's admired that church until he found that all that was in her was death death is not dying you know hearts quit beating oh they did oh that soul lives on no matter whether you're sinner or saint that soul lives on until a time because only god can kill a soul that's right satan can't kill one amen he can blow you to pieces brother ray but he can't kill you he just puts you in the other side death is a name it's a personification of satan because the word is a person which is a personification of almighty god back on these things sickly pale horse oh it reads er that he had power to do this and that because he had all the governments and everything in the world but he's got no power over the bride of jesus christ right i remember drawing out for some brothers one time at a meeting we were having we were talking about how that gets over to the end and what happens with israel and i asked the question of who was fighting and by this quote to the prophet and the scripture i took out a position everybody even the two witnesses are killed before armageddon well who's fighting well that's where everybody will bless god we'll come back riding on him horses and we're just going to sword we're just going to kill we're just going to cut people you can see what kind of a demon spirit they've got right a supernatural person sitting on a supernatural horse to battle natural people with an army tank all you gotta do that's gone but when i draw it down i drove it out and you know what's left the last was two witnesses left standing on the earth i said but the bible says they're killed right that's right now who's going to fight it then brother the bible says out of the mouth of those two prophets will come the word of god that will annihilate the enemy it will be the word that will destroy satan ain't gonna be no physical battle that's not what everybody read the bible says michael in revelation 12 michael and all fought in heaven and they throw him out like michael and jesus was just slugging it out boy they just fighting gabriel whatever like a physical force satan just brought his powers up and jesus standing there as michael because that's where satan could never understand it he says can i you have no more right here that's right all right there wasn't no physical fighting that's right there's no fighting now christ is in charge as long as he's in charge what are we afraid of amen but enemy could destroy us why can't we at least be like israel now right now we're standing the whole world and we americans are patting around trying to sit somewhere in the world to keep them and keep giving away their land and typing them into it to try to have peace and they say give us but we'll blow the whole thing up they can take it all down they're sitting on the center of the earth why would they say we have the sampson effect you afraid of their bombs what would be the samson effect what if they know exactly where they're sitting and they know to put off a bomb under the earth right there will bring the whole thing to total annihilation remember the pyramid of egypt chiops is sitting in the center of the earth come on church what are we afraid of all right that's all i'm trying to get you to look at we're looking at a pail we look at the red we look at them we see the power they have but now look at this you said it's got all the powers but what good is those powers you know we preach back are the satan has no power only what god permits him to use that's right are you afraid of any country or any thing brother i'm afraid of dying well then you need to be saved that's right that's the best way to get rid of the free of dying right now let's stand together let him be on our side michael on our side we don't have to worry about nothing do it he'll take care of it anybody have a need your altar is open let's sing and worship and think about it but what he's doing for us even the symbol of the seal is not a powerful looking something it's a weak sickly probably didn't lose it believe it just as mixings the bible tells you sickly looking he's defeated right sure we got a battle of armageddon but it's a spiritual battle what's going on now we'll get down to that we'll see death destroyed amen somebody is right and why can't we be where are we 97 lord jesus consensus anybody have a need what do you is thank is jesus yes is foreign is satisfaction oh thank you is most of you know that the donny didn't have been taking care of andy's kids and things and you know we've been praying hoping they would work out things and maybe that ricky could get straightened out and do things it don't look like it's working out now they're set to the place that they can go to court now and the children can be theirs and maybe they'll get them totally free i mean they will could not they wouldn't fool with it they can get everything free but still it's something to think about when you gotta take three children and raise them everything is your own so they just want us to pray that god will work out everything for perfect will for what he wants that's right they're willing to do their part it may mean a lot of things but i just want what would we all do when you're faced with a thing of knowing that the children don't have a hoax whatsoever nowhere else what are you going to do let's all pray let's all believe just like we would like we would dedicate a baby that we have let's say this whole church is dedicated now to raise that baby you know give a life before it and things well let's just put this into the hands of the lord amen and believe that god will work it all out for his honor and glory and that whatever comes out of it it'll be his honor it'll be his his doings because we're going to believe it that way that's right everything so they're willing to give up the children give them full control so that's as long as they'll do that that i wouldn't go no other way hardly but you still couldn't close your home to a child and not take care of it those little kids are wonderful little kids that's right let's just pray on it lord jesus as a church of the living god we come before you this night with heavy hearts in many ways because we know and realize these children have no hopes without donnie and susan but no one also lowered that taking on the family and raising us a lot of burdens and heartaches but we know that it can all be wonderful if we just leave it in your hands and let you take care of it lord you just touched the children and that's donnie and susan and everything lord you work out everything but there'll be a lot of financial things in it raising kids lord just help bless and take care of everything but just have brother donahue sister susan to have the right attitude in their hearts that whatever comes with this will come for your honor and glory all be made manifest for you lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen we're going to believe everything will be alright it'll all be worked out all right anybody else will just have a need before we go here there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon jesus didn't have one more oh we shall see the king we shall see is night of jesus christ we shall see the king we shall see coming soon one more time before we go we shall see the king we shall see the king we shall see the kingdom oh jesus said he she can handle this thing now the kingdom around this world we shall see the kingdoms pieces you
