amen so um I ain't got nothing for y'all to look at um I'm I'm y'all y'all pray for me I'm gonna get better at technology I'm not technologically advanced like the rest of them but uh uh we're gonna we're gonna get all the bugs worked out one of these days so uh there's more now on a look at a little fault here and uh I want to read Romans chapter 1 verses 16 and 17 and then Matthew chapter 15. and Romans 1 16 17 very familiar scripture says for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek he said for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and Matthew chapter 15 beginning at verse 1. says then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the trans the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he he that curseth father or mother let him die of the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father and or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honored not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition he Hypocrites welded Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and that's one thing I want to look at uh the doctrines because we have you can have the doctrines or is it following the Commandments of men and one of the things that I was I was looking at some things and then I was thinking about was in Bible Study last night and you know you can have the word and one of the questions was asked about uh revelation I said can you get a revelation without being born again well I've always said when God begins to deal with you justification is a revelation when he brings you to the place of you understand because you've got to see that you're Justified you've got to come to a place to realize that you're lost and you need a savior amen that's a revelation God shows you who you are because when you realize I'm in this place and there's a Chasm between me and God and there's only one that's going to bridge that Chasm and that's Jesus Christ and he's offering you the gift a free gift of salvation for you to come into fellowship with him he wants to bring you into this place when you see that that's the Revelation and as brother Wade was speaking you know when you see that the Revelation when God begins to deal with you that that revelation then you can't stay in the same place that you were before because that Revelation is to bring you to a closer step so when you come into justification then the Lord begins when you step into that what's in in Acts 2 when he's when he says to repent and be baptized what is what does repent mean it means to turn from your old ways so when you turn from the old your old ways now that doesn't that doesn't mean that you're not going to fall that doesn't mean you're not going to fail it doesn't mean you're not going to have problems but you know what you make a conscious effort to turn away from the old things you you know when you get to that place the Lord has to do a work in your life but there's something that we do you know you can't be around the same people that you were around before you have to make a conscious effort to change who you are you know you know one of my one of my favorite loves and and one of the things that I I was absorbed with I mean absolutely absorbed with was country music ask Janine asked Richard I was I was I mean you you asked me I knew all about it I know I knew songwriters I know I know singers anybody that wanted different Awards over the years I knew them I knew all kinds of people I was like a walking encyclopedia I just absorbed everything because it was just something I love I just I played it all the time but you know when the Lord began to deal with me and the Lord saved me you know I had to I had to turn all that away and you know what when I give my heart to the Lord you know what the love of country music didn't leave you know what it took it took some sanctification to get there but you know it was it was a process but you know what I sold all my CDs I got rid of all my stuff all because I had to make a conscious effort to stay away from that and so when you get to that point you've got to set all that aside yes and so then you start trying to make that conscious effort but you know the desire had to leave and it's just like smoking and you know those different things you've got to try to put that away yeah man I'm going to step away from that but you know you've got but the Lord has to do the sanctification and just like the sister that brother Branham was talking about you know you can't go and and Witness to those people as she did in the dance hall and said well I'm so I'm I'm so delivered from that we'll come to find out she realized she wasn't delivered from that because when she got back into that atmosphere it drew her right back in and she was right back out on the Dance Floor and so it's the same way when you when you receive that revelation God is bringing you to a closer walk but you know we've got to put some effort into it ourselves and that doesn't mean when you when you fall and when you fail you know what the grace of God is still there to cover you and you know what you just pick up and you just keep going you know and so you just you just keep going forward I I fall I fail but you know what I if I can't look at myself you can't look at yourself because you know what we can confess our faults and he is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness is what the scripture tells us then you know what we just go before the Lord and you know you know what I'm not I can't do this but you know I'm gonna put some effort into it amen I'm gonna pray and you know what and everything's gonna get in your way and I'm going to pray and I'm gonna read my Bible but you know what you've got you've got to press into that and you know what the devil's going to be there right but right beside you right in front of you he's going to handle you all the way but you know what you just got to keep fighting him you got to keep pressing that battle and you know as you stay in the word through the word comes sanctification because as you feed on the word the Holy Ghost is in it and see that's another Revelation that comes because he begins to reveal to you you'll start to see the unclean Spirit go out you'll start to see those things that you battled that you know I can't overcome these things and brother Donnie would tell you we stepped down at the shop years ago and he was and you know he kept telling me I can't give up cigarettes but you know I told him I said I told him exactly what he needed to do right just keep on going I said when you get sick when you get down to business with God God will get down to business with you that's right and when you get to that place where you like you said when you get tired of being sick and tired and you want to get rid of that thing and you you get before God and you get get serious with God God will come on the scene but sometimes we're just kind of like this scripture here and you know one of the reasons why I want to read this scripture is because you know Jesus said they they took the doctrines and the made the they made they caught the for the doctrines the Commandments of men and you know he was talking about by your Traditions you've made the word of God of none effect and one of the one of the definitions of tradition is an is an ordinance it's like a law but one of the definitions that I found I thought was really interesting it means giving up giving over the act of giving up as in the surrender of cities and I thought that was really interesting when I was reading that was what caught my attention is when you look at that when when the Lord has brought you to a place and the word has come to you and just like they did those Pharisees and the Sadducees they took the word that they had heard and it was tradition to them it wasn't in the law they had read into that and they had made their own rules their own traditions and because of that they put that on equal billing with the law of Moses and so they equaled these and Had Each one had to have the same reverence so when they saw the disciples come by and they didn't wash their hands and they didn't wash pots and they didn't do certain things they were highly upset with those disciples and they come to Jesus why do they do that and he was like well why is it that y'all don't follow the word when the when the and because they had got to this place of looking at everything a certain way they had lost the reverence for the for the for the word and many times in our lives we can do the exact same thing in the fact that if we allow it's like well I yes you can overcome but if we allow the devil to put in our mind we can't overcome you can't be healed you can't be delivered you've always battled this and you'll always battle this you know your grandparents had diabetes your parents had diabetes and they say you've got diabetes well you know what the diabetes devil can get off yeah because the word of God Says by his stripes we were healed and so just because it come down through my genealogy the physical genealogy doesn't mean that I'm accepting those rattlesnakes and just because brother Brown said you know we all have tempers well you know what hey we still battling this flesh but you know what we don't have to battle him forever why because there's Deliverance but by the word by the word that has come we have received deliverance and we just continue to walk in that justification was a revelation Saints vacations of Revelation the baptism the new birth is a revelation and then we know that coming up through the stature of a perfect man every one of those is a revelation it's a continuation but you know what it's the same Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost starts you on your journey and you start going in every step of the way it's the Holy Ghost leading you all the way and you just continue but you know we don't have to we don't have to back up for the devil we don't have to accept somebody else's thoughts or ideas about it you know those Pharisees and Sadducees they they had heard for years all those Generations had heard that oral tradition as law and they wouldn't transgress that for nothing but here they are but they had spent more time worried about this the the certain things about tithing all these little mints and cumin and all this other stuff and Jesus said you've turned away from the way there matters of the scripture right because they're so because they were so interested in certain little things and they didn't understand the scene to look at the big picture and they had missed out and they were and they were so tied up with certain things that they missed God brother Branham said that the word was made flesh the Messiah was standing in front of them and they were so wrapped up in their own tradition of things that they were had missed the very God Messiah standing in front of them and standing there speaking to them and they had missed that's though they who they were looking for they had spent all these years looking hey we know the Messiah is coming with a messiah's coming he's going to fulfill the word but he didn't come the way they wanted him to he didn't come the way they expected him to and when he didn't come that way then they were then they they you know they come against him and brother Brown said they turned him down they turned it down but when Jesus stood before them and told them said search the scriptures and then you say you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me and here they are standing in front of them and beginning to speak the word and here they are expressing the word but Jesus brings them back to the under the true revelation of what the word says not just saying something you know you know throughout the the years we see a number of people and I thank God for our for our pastor and his ministry all these years but you know there's lots of people that that have heard and just like the Pharisees they've heard a commandment they've heard a tradition and it's like well you know what we all we all come we're here with this seed in US and it's like well let's go back to the scripture and let's see what the scripture says and you know and then it's like well you know you talk about Daniel 70 weeks or or different things you know you asked who's who's taught on the stature of a perfect man all these doctrines and it's like well you know we believe them but nobody nobody digs into them and it almost has become a tradition that people have not looked at the word that nobody's dug into the word but you know we've had a pastor that has really calmed this message and he is and he has labored in the word and we've had a five-fold Ministry brother Wade brother Bob from Louise man they have flavored in the word and you know we have we have the word and I think about brother Keith you know meeting I don't know when he met brother Dale brother Wade them but you know man I tell you what I I thoroughly have enjoyed I get to I don't know if y'all know this but not but brother Keith churches on YouTube you can you can listen to and uh I tell you what if you uh there's a little side note um if if you if you feel down and you don't think you can uh you need a little pick me up y'all listen to the song Services sometimes and uh I don't you know I think if if I don't stir your soul your spoon's fat all your bowl but you know you see these brothers and you know they have labored in the word and you know it was of course you know somebody had to set aside their their ideas their tradition whatever they thought and you know they had to get into the word and dig yes and you know just like when the disciples were there and and they are looking in the word but Peter had a revelation when Jesus stood there and told asked the disciples who do men say that I am I the son of man am well you're one of the prophets you know you're you're one but who do you say that I am not whatever what man says what everybody else says what's what's the leading thought of today but who do you say that I am and Peter stood there and says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed are you Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my father's revealed this to you right and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church they said the gates of hell won't Prevail against it brother Brown said he didn't mean that the gates of hell wouldn't come against you with everything that it had but the gates of hell can't Prevail over you the gates of hell all the power in hell can't overcome you can't be defeated if we stand on the word if there's a place that God has made for us to stand and that's where God has wanted us to be stand on the word because if we stand there then we have a place yes then when when we say well I don't understand something Peter didn't understand he didn't understand the disciples didn't understand but you know what they knew who he was and and they followed in what he had what he told them and so you know even in all their faults and failures you know what God didn't give Jesus didn't give up on them they you know what he told him he said I'm going to go away they said destroy this temple in three days and I'll raise it up again you know what Peter didn't agree with that Peter didn't say that but you know it didn't change it didn't change Jesus's fault on Peter he kept telling him said Peter when you when you get converted when you get over yourself when you get converted when you get over this when when the Holy Ghost comes in and quickens the word that you're holding listen strengthen your brethren you know when you think about all the faults and failures that Peter had and all the problems Jesus stand there and told him said Peter he said Satan has desired to sift you like wheat he said but I prayed for you he had somebody that was interceding on his behalf and let me tell you something we have a great high priest this morning and you know what he desires the best for each one of us and wherever you are this morning whatever your need is this morning he's here to meet and so whatever you have native you don't have to worry about the things that have come in the past you know what because the sea of forgetfulness is there The Depths to be all of your sin is to be put in the depths of the sea as as Paul said he said putting those things that are behind me he said I pressed toward the mark of the high calling I'm putting all these things behind me because you know if I just let all the things that I've seen all the things in my peripheral you know I you won't get anywhere and that's what the devil he brings all these things before you he wants you to keep I but there's one thing we do we keep our Eye On Christ amen we keep her out where he said for us to go he's made that promise that I'm not looking at what what doctors Reports say it's like our doctor says this but I got a doctor's report over here from the great physician it's like well which one am I going to look at him well you know what as long as long as you got breath in your body and you and you're still moving you know then you know what I'm still looking at my stripes we're healed nothing trumps that when the wind the the harder the battle the the more the Devil Comes against you then you know what it's the greater the victory when you say your your love lost your lost loved ones when you're when your children you and your are doing all kinds of things and you look and think well how's this how's this going to work out well you know what I ain't trying to figure out how it's going to work out God didn't ask me if to figure it out he said Do You Believe that I saw that's all I can do I can put it in God's hands because he's the one that'll take care of the problems he's the ones that'll solve it because I you know I always think about in the message letting off the pressure that sister that had the grown children and brothers talk about you know she's like 60 years old she looks 30. and she said well brother Brandon when I when I was young I give my heart to the Lord and said you know he said cast all you cares upon Him and he said that's what I done I cast all my cares on him and we'll have the musicians come on this morning we're getting ready to finish but he said I cast all my cares on him because I realize that he said he would take care of my problems he would take care of me and you know what I'll cast them all on him because you know what if he can't carry him I know I can't carry him amen and you know she had such peace she had let off all that pressure and you know what he didn't she wasn't worried about all these things she didn't carry all that stress and all that why and it showed on her countenance that she had cast her cares upon Him and it's the best place God wants us wants to carry your burdens he said come argue that labor and are heavy laden yes and he said I'll give you rest and you know many times we we want to just like the little story I'm gonna I'm gonna finish here but it was like the little story about the about the little boy that had the toy that brought it to his dad he wanted him to fix it and he kept wondering why he couldn't why his dad wouldn't fix it and he's like son he said as long as you're holding on to it I can't fix it but he said you've got to turn it over to me he said when you let go of it he said then I can fix it and many times in our lives we think we've turned things over to the Lord and really when we take a full account when we really sit down and pray about things sometimes we realize you know we think we turned over the Lord but we keep muddling in it yeah and we kept messing with it and you know what we turn it over to the Lord and say thank you Lord Ed I lay it in your hands well then you know I'm not I'm not digging in it anymore we're trying to figure out things I'm free of that because then then I don't have to try to try to figure it out or worry or fret or anything about it because it's in his hands amen God bless you this morning foreign [Applause]
