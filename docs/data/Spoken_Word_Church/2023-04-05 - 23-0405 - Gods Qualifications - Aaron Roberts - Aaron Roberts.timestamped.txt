[3:22] amen Matthew
[3:24] chapter 9. begin at verse 10.
[3:29] there it is
[3:30] and scripture says and it came to pass
[3:33] as Jesus said it meet and the house
[3:35] behold many publicans and sinners came
[3:38] and sat down with him and his disciples
[3:41] and when the Pharisees saw it they said
[3:43] unto his disciples why eateth your
[3:45] master Republicans and sinners but when
[3:48] Jesus heard that he said unto them they
[3:51] that behold need not a physician but
[3:54] they that are sick but ye go and learn
[3:56] what that meaneth and I will have mercy
[3:59] and not sacrifice for I am not come to
[4:02] call this righteous but Sinners to
[4:04] repentance amen God bless the reading of
[4:07] the word you may be seated
[4:09] and my my title tonight is called God's
[4:12] qualifications
[4:15] and this is a this is from the message
[4:18] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[4:21] brother Brian says there's an old
[4:24] proverb that's more than a proverb no
[4:26] matter how
[4:27] who is there first you have to play the
[4:30] rules of the game or you'll never win
[4:33] if a runner is running around the track
[4:35] and one takes a shortcut and cuts
[4:37] through the field and beats the other
[4:38] one there by half hour still he will be
[4:41] disqualified at the end of the race he's
[4:43] got to play it according to the rules of
[4:46] the game or he's disqualified and he
[4:49] said that's the way we have to do the
[4:51] race of life that we're running now it
[4:54] has to be played according to God's
[4:56] qualifications or will lose when we get
[4:58] there
[4:59] whether we're president whether we are
[5:01] the governor or minister or who what
[5:04] church we belong to what denomination
[5:06] the rules of the game has to be kept we
[5:09] must run it fair we must play it by the
[5:12] rules we must preach the word we must do
[5:14] it willingly Paul said I believe in
[5:16] Hebrews the 12th chapter that saying we
[5:19] are compassionate about was such a great
[5:21] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[5:23] every weight and to send the dust so
[5:25] he'll easily beset us that we might run
[5:27] with patience the race that set before
[5:30] us Paul was speaking in the Olympics and
[5:32] so forth that was in Greece and Rome so
[5:34] forth
[5:35] he know that you had to play that game
[5:38] fair if you did not you'd be
[5:40] disqualified and tonight as born-again
[5:42] Christians as Believers here at the end
[5:44] time we've got to play the game
[5:46] according to the rules we've got to run
[5:49] with patience the race has set before us
[5:51] looking to the author and finisher Jesus
[5:53] Christ
[5:55] and so I just want to look at a few
[5:58] things tonight and the definition of of
[6:01] qualification says equality
[6:04] accomplishment Etc that sits a person
[6:07] for some function office or the like a
[6:10] circumstance or condition required by
[6:12] law or custom forgetting having or
[6:15] exercising or right holding an offer or
[6:17] the like the act of qualifying the state
[6:20] of being qualified
[6:22] the word qualified the definition for
[6:24] that is to have a legal right to have or
[6:27] do something because of the situation
[6:29] you are in or to call someone to have
[6:31] such a right
[6:33] to achieve or to have the standard of
[6:35] skill knowledge or ability that is
[6:37] necessary for doing or being something
[6:40] or to call someone to reach that
[6:42] standard
[6:44] and so I just want to look at a few
[6:46] things tonight
[6:48] and
[6:49] there's several scriptures that I'll
[6:51] that I want to look at tonight but I
[6:53] when I was thinking this is the
[6:55] scripture that that came to mind is when
[6:58] the Pharisees were there and you know
[7:01] when Jesus came he came to minister
[7:05] the scripture said he said I'm not I've
[7:07] not come to be ministered to but he said
[7:09] I come to minister
[7:12] and you know he he because he knew what
[7:15] his role was what his what his calling
[7:18] was
[7:19] and when he when he began to deal with
[7:21] the people you know there was a there
[7:22] was a calling there was a longing in the
[7:24] people and you know he came to to reach
[7:27] out to the people and it was the people
[7:30] that heard him that had a long had a
[7:32] desire that he reached out to
[7:35] then they came and it says you know he
[7:37] came to sit and he said many publicans
[7:40] and sinners came
[7:42] to fellowship with him
[7:44] and you know and then here's he says the
[7:47] Pharisees came and they were like why
[7:49] why are y'all hanging out with the
[7:50] lowlifes and the no goods and you know
[7:53] all of these people
[7:56] but Jesus had an answer
[7:58] because you know he didn't go by what
[8:01] the Pharisees qualifications were
[8:04] see their qualifications were they had a
[8:07] certain standard like listen we're not
[8:08] going to hang around those people
[8:10] because they have a bad name
[8:13] but see when Jesus brought the word back
[8:15] to them because they were supposed to
[8:17] know the law
[8:18] and they were supposed to know who they
[8:20] were and what what the word was sent to
[8:23] do and he said this is what it was sent
[8:25] to do he said the physio he said the
[8:27] physician comes to those that are sick
[8:28] those that are whole those that are well
[8:31] he said they don't need a physician but
[8:33] he said the ones that are sick and needy
[8:36] he said they're the ones that come
[8:37] because they're the ones that I've
[8:38] reached out to and he said they are the
[8:41] ones that respond to the word they
[8:43] either respond to the call and he said
[8:45] he said but you said you go and learn
[8:46] what it means
[8:48] man why because he made it known what he
[8:51] was supposed to do
[8:53] because they had because they had such a
[8:55] high idea of what the Messiah was going
[8:58] to do but they didn't realize that he
[9:00] came to be a servant that he came to be
[9:02] the lowest of the low to reach the
[9:05] lowest of the low that he became he
[9:07] became what you and I were though we
[9:09] might become what he is so when he came
[9:11] then he came he stepped into this role
[9:13] then he said you need to learn and
[9:15] understand that he said then I will have
[9:16] mercy
[9:17] well because when you realize that
[9:19] you're not as high as you think you are
[9:20] because because you know you're not who
[9:22] you think you are because you realize
[9:24] that you're separated from God because
[9:27] when he when he began to explain to the
[9:29] scriptures to the Pharisees you know
[9:31] what they didn't have a place to stand
[9:33] when when the woman at the the woman
[9:36] that they brought that was in the act of
[9:38] adultery when they came and he began to
[9:41] write on the ground when he began to
[9:43] explain you know whatever it was that he
[9:45] began to write on the screen on the
[9:46] ground but whatever it was it was
[9:48] something that was a rebuke to them
[9:50] hey whatever it was but but I believe
[9:52] what it was to her no matter what it was
[9:54] to them to her it was Grace it was Grace
[9:57] applied to her so when it when it's
[9:59] because when all of a sudden all of her
[10:00] accusers are gone and he said where are
[10:02] your accusers well lord they're gone and
[10:04] he said well neither do I condemn you he
[10:07] said but go and sin no more so it was
[10:09] something that was given to her that was
[10:11] a real that was a blessing to her but
[10:13] you know he just didn't he just didn't
[10:15] whitewash everything but he told her not
[10:17] to do it anymore but but he brought her
[10:19] into a fellowship into a place listen
[10:21] this is what you need to do
[10:24] well because you know what he didn't
[10:26] have her under his foot
[10:29] he didn't cast your album why because he
[10:32] came to bring Sinners to repentance but
[10:35] you know what if you can't if you can't
[10:36] ever get to the place to realize that
[10:38] you're a sinner that you're lost that
[10:39] you need help you'll never get any help
[10:41] but that's why God wants us to see
[10:43] because the Pharisees couldn't see that
[10:45] well because they were so self-righteous
[10:47] in what they had
[10:50] that there was nothing to God it was
[10:53] actually a stink in his nostrils
[10:56] but he was but he wanted to reach out
[10:58] this is what they come to do
[11:02] and so it's not it's not what our
[11:04] qualifications are it's God's
[11:06] qualifications
[11:08] the whole Bible is based on God's
[11:10] qualifications not ours
[11:13] many times you know the problem is we
[11:15] need to see we need to see the way you
[11:17] see the things the way God sees them we
[11:20] need to see things the way God we need
[11:22] to see with God's eyes not our eyes
[11:26] you know many times we see you know how
[11:28] brother Brown was speaking there in in
[11:30] Ohio I believe it was where he was there
[11:32] and he went to that restaurant or
[11:35] whatever it was and he seen the police
[11:36] officer and that woman in that
[11:37] restaurant
[11:40] you know they were gambling and you know
[11:42] all the immoral things that they had
[11:45] done or whatever and you know he began
[11:46] he began to look at that woman and said
[11:49] Lord do my daughters have to be raised
[11:52] in a country that in a state that looks
[11:55] like that
[11:56] that's that's the condition the world is
[11:58] in that my daughters have to be raised
[12:00] in that and all he could do is condemn
[12:02] that woman and all of a sudden when when
[12:04] the Lord brought him back and said
[12:06] listen I want you to see who you are
[12:08] I wanted I want you to say your
[12:10] condition
[12:11] when he began to say the bumper blood
[12:13] that covered around the world when he
[12:15] realized he didn't have a place to stand
[12:17] he was he was without anything
[12:20] when he stood before God he was naked he
[12:22] didn't have anything it was only the by
[12:24] the grace of God to bump her blood that
[12:26] covered him that they covered him that
[12:28] made him righteous before God then all
[12:31] of a sudden when he saw they saw the
[12:32] condition realized that he didn't have a
[12:34] place to stand then all of a sudden he
[12:36] could go and Minister that woman and
[12:38] begin to speak to her about her
[12:40] condition and then all of a sudden he
[12:42] goes up there and apologized to her for
[12:44] for the condition and for his way of
[12:47] thinking about her
[12:49] when he began to con because what he
[12:51] could was condemning her hey there was
[12:54] no way that he could reach her there was
[12:55] no way he could help her but when he got
[12:57] to the place when he got to see her the
[12:59] way God saw her when he got Beyond his
[13:02] own self and he began to see that then
[13:03] he could help her then God could use him
[13:06] to help
[13:07] and it's the same way with you and I we
[13:09] have to use God's way of thinking God's
[13:12] qualifications not our own
[13:16] you know many scriptures in the Bible we
[13:19] can we can see through the scriptures
[13:21] and there was a couple of scriptures
[13:24] that you know I was thinking about
[13:26] reading but I just want to read a quote
[13:28] a little bit from them but the other one
[13:30] that come to mind was the Rich Young
[13:32] Ruler
[13:33] you know when the Rich Young Ruler come
[13:34] to Jesus and you know he's a good Master
[13:36] you know what do I need to inherit
[13:38] eternal life well you know the good
[13:40] thing is is this young young man he had
[13:43] a lot of things going for you but the
[13:44] one thing he realized what he needed he
[13:46] come to ask the man who had it what he
[13:49] needed amen
[13:53] amen but the problem was when Jesus
[13:55] began to speak to him
[13:58] and Jesus in the scripture says that
[14:00] Jesus loved him
[14:02] and he had a lot of good things going
[14:03] for him
[14:04] he was he was moving in the right
[14:06] direction
[14:08] but you know what many times people want
[14:10] to hear that they want to know the truth
[14:13] but when you tell them the truth they
[14:14] don't want to hear it
[14:16] they only think they want to know the
[14:17] truth
[14:20] you know many times people you know they
[14:23] I I've had I've had times even brother
[14:25] Brandon was talking about when he was in
[14:28] Mexico when that reporter come to him
[14:29] and asked him you know what you believe
[14:31] about the Catholic church and he's like
[14:33] I wish you would ask me that
[14:35] but I'll tell you what you if you wanted
[14:37] me to tell you I'll tell you what I
[14:39] think
[14:40] you know and people people coming
[14:42] they'll ask you you know what what do
[14:43] you think about women preachers or what
[14:45] do you think about this the way you
[14:46] think about that it's like well do you
[14:47] really want to know
[14:49] because you know if you want to know
[14:52] what the scripture says and it's not my
[14:54] idea but I'm going to tell you what God
[14:55] qualifies
[14:57] I'm going to tell you what the word says
[14:59] it ain't my idea and it ain't it ain't
[15:02] me trying to pick a fight with you but
[15:03] I'm gonna tell you what the Bible says
[15:06] then the fight is not the argument is
[15:09] not with me it's with what the Bible
[15:10] says
[15:13] but when he told them you know what you
[15:14] think about the Catholic church he said
[15:16] it's the highest form of spiritualism
[15:17] there was well if you don't want to know
[15:20] don't ask
[15:23] so when you begin to ask these questions
[15:26] you know you may not want you may not
[15:28] want the answer
[15:31] sometimes people say you know they want
[15:33] to come and they want to get help from
[15:35] the preacher you know they want they
[15:37] want counseling or they want everything
[15:39] well sometimes when they come they don't
[15:41] want the answer no
[15:43] no because all they want you to do is
[15:44] pet them
[15:47] you know they want you to you they want
[15:48] you to just Pat them on the back tell
[15:50] them they're okay well sometimes you
[15:51] can't tell them that
[15:53] sometimes a word that comes is going to
[15:56] be cutting it's going to be hard to
[15:57] swallow it's going to be difficult why
[15:59] because that's what the word does the
[16:02] word is corrective but it's love
[16:05] but people don't want that
[16:08] and so when the Rich Young Ruler came
[16:09] before Jesus and he asked him what do I
[16:12] need to be to to receive
[16:15] eternal life what do I need
[16:17] and he begins to tell what you know all
[16:19] the all the Commandments that he done
[16:21] well I've already done all those things
[16:22] and he had such a great life but when
[16:25] Jesus began to look at his life and tell
[16:27] him exactly what he had to do
[16:30] you know what your hold up is young man
[16:33] you got a problem with money
[16:37] you want to serve God but you know what
[16:39] your money is your god
[16:41] that's your hindrance
[16:43] but you know the thing is just like
[16:45] brother Brandon said how do you how do
[16:47] you get overcome all those problems he
[16:48] said do the vice versa just get rid of
[16:51] it
[16:52] and that's what Jesus told him listen
[16:54] you got a problem with money here get
[16:55] give it all to the poor
[16:58] but you know what he don't listen this
[17:00] is the plan I've got a plan for you it's
[17:03] an investment
[17:04] you're going to invest invest all your
[17:07] worldly Goods into the poor
[17:10] and you come follow me because you're
[17:12] making an investment in me and he said
[17:14] you'll have Treasures in Heaven
[17:16] that you're gonna that you're investing
[17:18] in something that all of a sudden you're
[17:20] going to get greater reaches than what
[17:22] you'll have
[17:24] well but you know he couldn't he
[17:26] couldn't understand that financial
[17:28] report
[17:30] because all of a sudden he says it says
[17:32] the scripture says that he was very
[17:34] sorrowful when he heard that because he
[17:36] had great possessions
[17:39] that Jesus said on his disciples barely
[17:42] I say unto you that a rich man shall
[17:43] hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
[17:47] he said again I say it is easier for a
[17:49] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[17:52] therefore a rich man to enter into the
[17:54] kingdom of God
[17:55] when his disciples heard it they were
[17:57] exceedingly amazed saying who then can
[18:00] be saved
[18:03] but Jesus beheld them and said unto them
[18:05] with man this is impossible
[18:09] but With God all things are possible
[18:13] so when he began to look at this
[18:14] situation man's qualifications don't
[18:16] work
[18:18] but God has a way to qualify you for
[18:21] this but you've got to follow the plan
[18:24] and so when it when it came this is the
[18:26] way that you do this because God knows
[18:28] exactly where each one of us are and he
[18:30] knows that what each one of us have need
[18:32] of
[18:33] but the problem is is when God begins to
[18:35] speak to us about it are we going to
[18:37] accept the plan
[18:40] are we going to be qualified
[18:43] because you know there's there's many
[18:45] different qualifications that we've got
[18:47] to look at but you know what God calls a
[18:49] man they don't not only he qualifies the
[18:52] man
[18:53] and he equips them in we'll read here in
[18:55] a minute but you see God makes the
[18:57] qualifications we don't
[19:01] many times in situations in our lives
[19:04] the problem is is we want to do things
[19:06] the way we want to do them
[19:08] we want to look at it the way we want to
[19:10] look at it
[19:11] and the problem is is we look at it the
[19:13] wrong way that's right
[19:16] because we're not looking at the way
[19:18] God's looking at it own there was a man
[19:20] in the Bible that had that same problem
[19:23] and his name was Saul
[19:26] and Saul had Saul had an issue because
[19:29] his problem was when God when Samuel
[19:32] told him what to do and how to do it he
[19:34] didn't follow the plan
[19:37] because a Saul got in it in his mind
[19:39] that he was qualified to make those
[19:41] decisions but it wasn't but it wasn't
[19:44] his it wasn't his qualification like
[19:46] those decisions because God had a man
[19:49] Samuel to give him the qualifications of
[19:51] what he was supposed to do because he
[19:53] was he was God's prophet and the word
[19:55] come to the prophet and Samuel told him
[19:57] what to do
[20:00] and he told him he said when you go to
[20:01] Hamlet he said you utterly destroyed it
[20:03] you don't take nothing there
[20:06] you leave it you burn it get rid of it
[20:08] it's built and it's it's not free for
[20:11] you to have
[20:14] it but you know when when he came
[20:17] you know he took all the
[20:19] he done exactly what the people wanted
[20:21] to do
[20:23] well you know we think
[20:26] because I'm qualified to make this
[20:27] decision
[20:28] I'm qualified to say that we're going to
[20:30] take the best of everything
[20:34] and he tells Samuel that we're going to
[20:36] offer this unto the Lord
[20:39] well you know we don't know if that's
[20:41] going to really be the case or not
[20:42] because you know what some of those nice
[20:44] sheep and cattle and everything may end
[20:46] up in somebody's Barn
[20:50] some some of these fine animals some of
[20:52] the some of this fine gold some of these
[20:54] fine garments may end up somebody's
[20:55] closet
[20:58] but he goes out there and he tells us
[21:00] but he's telling Samuel oh praise the
[21:01] Lord we've done the work of the Lord
[21:03] we've followed What did what was told of
[21:05] us we've done what was required of us
[21:09] and then when he began to tell you he
[21:11] said what is what is this lowing that I
[21:13] hear
[21:16] why why are these people here
[21:20] we these are not Israelites
[21:23] and why why are we hearing all these
[21:25] these animals
[21:28] and and and souls oh we've done the
[21:31] we've done the work of the Lord praise
[21:32] the Lord we've done it
[21:34] and he said no you have not
[21:38] as Samuel says and and uh chapter first
[21:42] Samuel 15 verse 22 says
[21:44] he said and Samuel said have God has the
[21:48] Lord as great delight and burnt
[21:49] offerings and sacrifice as in obeying
[21:51] the voice of the Lord
[21:53] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[21:56] and to hearken than the fat of Rams for
[21:58] as Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft
[22:00] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[22:02] idolatry because thou Hast rejected the
[22:05] word of the Lord he hath rejected thee
[22:07] from being King
[22:09] so when when he rejected the word of the
[22:12] Lord then because he was not qualified
[22:14] to make that distinction because he did
[22:17] not follow the word of the Lord then God
[22:19] told him said listen you're not
[22:20] qualified to be king anymore you're done
[22:22] away with
[22:24] and he said he said
[22:26] a Saul said unto the same I have sinned
[22:28] for I have transgressed the Commandment
[22:31] of the Lord now that was that was twice
[22:33] that Samuel had to tell Saul that he was
[22:35] wrong before he actually actually
[22:37] believed it
[22:39] he stood in the prophet's face and
[22:42] honestly told him that uh we've done it
[22:44] we followed the Lord we did
[22:47] but when when Samuel had to get real
[22:49] with him and had to stand in his face
[22:52] and tell him listen God has rejected you
[22:56] he said he said because he said I've
[22:58] transgressed the command of the Lord and
[23:00] thy words because I feared the people
[23:03] and obeyed their voice
[23:07] and so he continued therefore I pray
[23:10] thee pardon my sin and turn again with
[23:12] me that I may Worship the Lord
[23:15] and Samuel said unto Saul
[23:18] I will not return with thee for thou
[23:19] Hast rejected the word of the Lord and
[23:21] the Lord hath rejected thee from being
[23:23] King over Israel
[23:25] hey obeyed the voice and when when Saul
[23:28] begins to Samuel begins to tell him he's
[23:30] like you know when you were little in
[23:32] your own sight
[23:35] when you didn't think of much of
[23:37] yourself
[23:38] God thought enough of you to make you
[23:40] King
[23:43] but you've gotten to the place now where
[23:45] I
[23:46] it's not following the the Lord
[23:49] he said I feared the people
[23:52] I was more worried about what the people
[23:54] thought than what God thought
[23:58] I'm thinking more what they're doing and
[24:00] then when when Samuel rebukes him then
[24:03] he says oh Samuel will you turn and
[24:05] Worship the Lord with me
[24:07] because because he didn't want people to
[24:09] realize that God had rejected him
[24:12] Samuel will you come and put on just
[24:14] just put on this little show for other
[24:16] people
[24:19] to show everybody it's okay it's going
[24:21] to be okay
[24:23] and he's like no
[24:25] I'm turning away from you you've
[24:27] rejected the Lord and I'm turning away
[24:30] from you
[24:31] you've been rejected
[24:33] and as Samuel turned away to go away
[24:36] turned about to go away he laid hold
[24:39] upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent
[24:40] and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath
[24:43] rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee
[24:44] this day and hath given it to a neighbor
[24:47] of thine that is better than thou
[24:51] so I already had somebody
[24:53] but because of what he had done he had
[24:56] been rejected
[24:58] and he was turned away
[25:00] because God had given him
[25:03] what he was supposed to do
[25:05] and he rejected it and God rejected him
[25:09] and you know it was it was a
[25:11] heartbreaking thing for Samuel to have
[25:13] to do that
[25:15] because in the next chapter we you know
[25:17] he said he never saw Samuel never Samuel
[25:20] never saw Saul again
[25:23] when he walked away from me he turned
[25:25] his back on him and never went to see
[25:26] him again
[25:28] and you know it was a heartbreaking
[25:30] thing to do that
[25:32] because the scripture tells us in in
[25:34] chapter 16 and it says and the Lord said
[25:37] unto Samuel how long well thou mourn for
[25:40] Saul
[25:42] saying I've rejected him from reigning
[25:44] over Israel he said fill thine horn with
[25:46] all and to go and I will send thee to
[25:49] Jesse the bethlehemite for I have
[25:51] provided me a king among his sons
[25:53] now this is this is an interesting
[25:56] passage of scripture because when you
[25:58] know Samuel
[26:00] is as re you know because he's God's
[26:04] rejected Saul and he tells him said
[26:05] listen he said now I've got a king I've
[26:08] got somebody in mind I want him to be
[26:09] king and I want you to go anoint him
[26:12] and being and being the prophet of God
[26:14] the first thing Samuel's like uh I don't
[26:17] want to have to go against him
[26:19] and he's like well God tells me listen
[26:20] you just go down there and tell him
[26:22] you're gonna sacrifice
[26:24] because he didn't want he didn't want to
[26:26] get in the hour of the king
[26:30] but he sent him down there and said
[26:31] listen you just go down there and when
[26:33] he goes down there
[26:35] the escape the scripture says it go down
[26:37] to sacrifice and he said and called
[26:39] Jesse in verse 3 says and call Jesse to
[26:41] the sacrifice and I will show thee what
[26:43] Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto
[26:45] me him whom I name unto thee and Samuel
[26:48] said after which the Lord spake and came
[26:50] to Bethlehem and the Elders of the Town
[26:52] trembled at his coming and saying cometh
[26:54] thou peaceably and he said peaceably I
[26:57] am come to sacrifice unto the Lord
[26:58] sanctify yourselves and come with me to
[27:00] the sacrifice and he Sanctified Jesse
[27:03] and his sons and called them to the
[27:04] sacrifice
[27:06] now what's interesting about that is
[27:08] when you he said he called them to the
[27:11] sacrifice but when you see when he goes
[27:14] to anoint eliab God said that's not the
[27:17] one that I because he was the oldest and
[27:20] God says I rejected him
[27:22] but the Lord said in verse 7 said but
[27:24] the Lord said unto Samuel look not on
[27:26] his countenance nor on the height of his
[27:28] stature because I have refused him but
[27:30] the Lord seeketh not as man seeketh for
[27:33] the Lord looketh on the man looketh on
[27:35] the outward appearance but the Lord
[27:37] looketh on the heart and he continues to
[27:40] call the men the sons and he kept
[27:43] rejecting them
[27:45] now the verse before that says that he
[27:48] called Samuel called all the sons of
[27:51] Jesse to the sacrifice and they were
[27:54] supposed to sanctify but sudden they get
[27:55] down to verse 11 and Samuel says unto
[27:58] Jesse or hear all thy children
[28:02] well if he called all the children why
[28:04] why wasn't David already there
[28:07] he should all because if he said all
[28:09] your children all your sons well you
[28:10] know what David should have been there
[28:14] well you know what he was he was the
[28:16] least in the Kingdom at least in the
[28:18] family and he was the one that gets
[28:19] overlooked
[28:22] because he was he was the one that was
[28:24] out of out of the area
[28:26] you know he was not there
[28:28] he said or hear all thy children they
[28:30] said they're remaineth yet the youngest
[28:32] and behold he put the Sheep
[28:34] we just we got him doing something
[28:36] because we don't want him under our feet
[28:37] he gets in our way
[28:39] and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch
[28:42] him for we will not sit down till he
[28:44] come hither and he sent and brought him
[28:46] in and he but he now he was ready and
[28:49] with all of a beautiful countenance and
[28:51] goodly to look to and the Lord said
[28:53] arise anoint him for this is he and
[28:57] Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed
[28:59] him in the midst of his Brethren the
[29:01] spirit of the Lord came unto David from
[29:03] that day forward
[29:06] and verse 14 says but the spirit of the
[29:08] Lord departed from Saul and an evil
[29:10] spirit
[29:12] from the Lord troubled him
[29:14] but it was interesting that God was
[29:16] looking at the man on the on the inward
[29:20] part of a man
[29:22] but you know when they called
[29:24] even his own family didn't think too
[29:26] much of him
[29:28] but God knew what kind of man David was
[29:31] that God would call him when nobody else
[29:34] talked too much of him God knew what
[29:36] kind of man he was looking for
[29:39] a man after his own heart
[29:44] and so you know we don't we don't have
[29:46] the we don't have the qualifications but
[29:48] God knows has the qualifications he
[29:51] knows what he's looking for
[29:53] and God brings a man in
[29:56] and he gives him the qualifications
[29:59] now this is from the message of total
[30:01] deliverance and and brother Brandon was
[30:03] speaking of Moses he said and Moses when
[30:06] he was called by God he was a he was a
[30:08] total complete prophet
[30:10] and when God sends a man to do anything
[30:11] he completely equips him with everything
[30:13] that he has need of if God calls a man
[30:16] to pee a preacher he put something in
[30:18] him to preach with if he calls him to be
[30:20] a teacher he put something in him to
[30:22] teach with if he calls for him to be a
[30:24] prophet he put something in him to see
[30:26] visions and be a prophet God always
[30:28] completely equips his man and that's
[30:31] just what he done when he sent Moses
[30:33] into Egypt he raised him up in a certain
[30:36] way and he schooled him in a certain way
[30:38] and he molded him and made him and
[30:41] fashioned him
[30:42] so when he called Moses all the things
[30:45] that Moses had to go through
[30:48] you know many times when people they
[30:50] when they have a failure just like Moses
[30:53] when Moses was was pulled out of the out
[30:56] of the Nile by Pharaoh's daughter and
[30:58] was raised up in Pharaoh's house and he
[31:00] become this great man and he had this
[31:02] great understanding and great learning
[31:04] and it was this great man but when he
[31:06] become to try to do what what he was
[31:08] called to do what his mother told him
[31:10] that he was supposed to do was supposed
[31:11] to be the deliverer of God's people when
[31:14] he kept when he realized when his mother
[31:16] told him he said you're not the son of
[31:18] Pharaoh's daughter but you're the
[31:20] deliverer because we've prayed your
[31:22] father and I prayed for a deliverer
[31:24] because we were we were there when the
[31:26] taskmasters we've seen people die
[31:28] because of the Egyptians but God sent a
[31:31] deliverer and it's you God give you the
[31:33] calling amen
[31:35] he called you to do this
[31:38] amen but when he come to the place he
[31:40] didn't follow God's plan he didn't do it
[31:42] in God's leading he didn't do it in
[31:43] God's time but he thought he could do it
[31:45] in his own self because he was so
[31:47] trained he was he was so smart he was so
[31:50] intelligent he thought he could work
[31:51] this thing he thought he could he could
[31:54] make a plan and make it happen
[31:57] but the problem was he all he done was
[31:58] cause a bunch of fighting and turmoil
[32:01] amongst all the all the Israel the
[32:04] children of Israel and had a day of
[32:06] Egyptian
[32:07] but you know then all of a sudden when
[32:09] all that happened there's people when
[32:11] when people have faults and failures and
[32:13] problems you know there's a lot of
[32:15] people you know they wouldn't have
[32:16] anything to do with Moses but you know
[32:18] why because you're an utter you're an
[32:20] utter failure you've made a big mess out
[32:23] of this and so we wouldn't touch you
[32:25] with a 10-foot Pole
[32:28] but you know what when God brought him
[32:30] all through that and put him on the back
[32:31] side of the desert for another 40 years
[32:33] to beat all of the all of the stuff of
[32:36] Egypt out of him all of his learning and
[32:38] everything when he beat all that out of
[32:40] him and 80 years of leaving God got into
[32:42] the place that he wanted him to be
[32:45] right and it wasn't and it wasn't what
[32:47] man thought of Moses's qualifications
[32:50] it's what God thought of God of Moses
[32:52] qualifications because God was the one
[32:54] that qualified him to be that and he and
[32:56] he made him and the way that he wanted
[32:58] him to be so he brought him to that
[33:00] place and when he went down there that
[33:01] he was in the place that he could be the
[33:03] deliverer
[33:04] why because it never changed what his
[33:06] calling was it just got him to the place
[33:08] that he could do it well because he got
[33:10] to the place where he could listen and
[33:12] follow the instructions of the Lord
[33:14] because God had to have because he had
[33:17] to have a one-on-one experience with God
[33:19] to come to the place that he could do
[33:21] that
[33:22] and when he got to the place where he
[33:24] could where he could come to and have an
[33:26] experience then God could use it
[33:30] many times that's what our problem is is
[33:32] we we don't lean to that
[33:36] you know we leaned our own understanding
[33:39] [Music]
[33:42] brother Brown continues on here he says
[33:44] then just like you if you're a Christian
[33:46] God Don't Make Any halfway Christians
[33:49] God makes complete Christians he said
[33:52] God Don't Make halfway preachers but the
[33:54] preacher can be halfway and God makes
[33:56] his children Christians but sometimes
[33:59] they're halfway Christians but it's not
[34:01] God's intention for them to be that way
[34:04] it's their own ways God mixed up with
[34:07] the plan of God for their life and
[34:09] that's what makes them the way they are
[34:11] God don't want them to be halfway
[34:13] Christians or halfway preachers
[34:15] compromising on each side hey he won't
[34:17] or he wants them to be completely stand
[34:19] in the breach them to completely stand
[34:21] in the breach
[34:23] and he said see Moses
[34:25] God made him a complete Prophet for a
[34:27] complete deliverance and Moses was
[34:29] completely surrendered into the hands of
[34:31] God that's the reason it made him what
[34:34] he was he was so complete in God till
[34:36] God could trust him he come to the place
[34:39] one because he went through those things
[34:42] because of what he had been through in
[34:43] his life it brought him to the place
[34:45] that God could trust him but he could
[34:46] yield himself to God brother Brown says
[34:49] continuing on he said I wonder this
[34:51] morning as Christians if we have yielded
[34:54] our own will and yielded ourselves
[34:56] completely to God till God can trust us
[34:59] the place that he has put us
[35:03] why because we want to be used of God
[35:05] well if God has put us in there but have
[35:06] we yielded ourselves to that
[35:10] we can be halfway Christians but if we
[35:13] can steal Christians but are we just
[35:15] halfway are we just three quarters
[35:17] because you know like the old song is
[35:19] you know we're looking for a hundred
[35:20] because 99 and a half won't do because
[35:23] if there's any part of us that has no
[35:25] yielded ourselves to God then you know
[35:27] what God is not looking for that
[35:31] because you know what you can be 99
[35:33] yielded to God and be a hundred percent
[35:35] failure
[35:36] because God wants us to be totally
[35:39] absolutely yielded to him
[35:41] we don't have we don't have a thought
[35:43] coming we don't have an idea coming it's
[35:45] What God Says
[35:48] let us yield ourselves to him
[35:51] and see have we give that God can trust
[35:54] us in the place he's put us he said The
[35:56] Minister's got a place of Duty to stand
[35:58] and preach the unsearchable riches of
[36:01] Christ without compromising if he's
[36:03] called to be a preacher he won't he
[36:05] won't spare one thing for one person if
[36:07] he's called to be a preacher
[36:10] man why because you know it's it's not
[36:12] all fun and games
[36:14] well because everybody you know people
[36:16] are like well you know preachers want to
[36:18] want to you know turn a blind eye to
[36:20] this or or their family or whatever no
[36:22] you've got you've got to have it's got
[36:24] to be even it's got to be because what's
[36:26] good for one is good for all that's
[36:28] right you can't you can't just turn a
[36:29] blind eye to this one and that one
[36:32] it's always got to be and you know what
[36:34] it's not it's not always fun but you
[36:36] know what it's it's the word of God
[36:42] but you know that's that's the one thing
[36:43] that most people are always going to see
[36:47] you know it's always gonna be well
[36:48] brother Wade said this to me but you
[36:50] know such and such got by with it or
[36:52] they but you know what you never see the
[36:54] other side of the coin you never see the
[36:56] other side of the situation
[37:00] because well you know brother Dale may
[37:02] handle one situation a certain way and
[37:03] another another thing comes up and he
[37:05] handles it a different way and people
[37:07] what why is it why is that why was it
[37:09] this way and why was it that way why
[37:10] because God knows what he's doing
[37:13] amen many times we don't know we don't
[37:16] know what God has told somebody
[37:19] why is it because you know it's just
[37:21] like in the scripture when people like
[37:22] well why is this this way why is that
[37:24] way I said well why is it that when God
[37:25] says not to make any Graven image but
[37:27] then he turns around to tell Moses to
[37:29] raise up a Brazen serpent for healing
[37:32] why because you've got to know God is
[37:34] Sovereign and God's going to handle it a
[37:37] certain way yeah
[37:39] yeah amen because many times people get
[37:42] upset with things and it's like well I
[37:43] don't like this and I don't like that
[37:44] but the problem is is we've not sat down
[37:46] and prayed and found out what God says
[37:48] about it and so instead of opening our
[37:50] mouth and saying things before we
[37:52] actually pray about it and think what
[37:54] we're going to say
[37:58] you know when God Called Moses to be the
[38:01] deliverer when God called him to do a
[38:04] work then you know what there was no
[38:06] place no matter what went on what went
[38:09] on
[38:10] you know what Miriam and Aaron had no
[38:12] place to stand up and criticize Moses
[38:17] no matter no matter it was their their
[38:20] brother that they that they were saying
[38:22] that about it was still God's prophet
[38:24] and still God had had stand and rejected
[38:28] that and had and had to rebuke that
[38:31] and they had to be judged for it
[38:36] and sometimes you know why because we're
[38:38] so quick to say things and not realize
[38:40] what we're saying why because there's
[38:41] power in your words
[38:43] by your words you'll be justified by
[38:45] your words you'll be condemned but
[38:47] you've got to be careful by what you say
[38:51] amen
[38:54] and so many times you know I I just want
[38:56] I don't want to hold my peace or hold my
[38:58] tongue I may think things but you know
[39:00] the thing is Lord let me pray about it
[39:01] before I say anything
[39:04] because many times we don't know what's
[39:06] going on
[39:12] and so when it's not when it's not our
[39:14] place and we've got to be careful what
[39:15] we say
[39:21] that's reason it's so important that we
[39:23] pray
[39:25] and you pray for the leadership of this
[39:27] church
[39:33] well I'll tell you something it's not
[39:35] I don't I don't know about y'all but I'm
[39:38] gonna tell you this but I don't believe
[39:39] there's anybody in this church that's up
[39:41] here that's got a position that's doing
[39:43] this because you know they they want to
[39:45] have somebody looking at them and it's
[39:47] they're doing it on their own
[39:52] I believe I believe the I believe the
[39:54] ministry in this church is Led of God
[39:59] and whether we like it or not whether we
[40:01] agree with them or not whether they hurt
[40:03] our feelings or not I still believe it's
[40:05] a god-cold Ministry
[40:09] and so and sometimes you know we let
[40:11] things get out of hand
[40:16] so that's the reason it's so important
[40:18] to be careful about what we say
[40:20] because you know what it's not it's not
[40:22] our qualifications for these things it's
[40:24] God's qualifications because God lays
[40:27] down the law and God gives gives the
[40:29] word
[40:31] and so whatever takes place we've got to
[40:33] be careful about it
[40:36] it can be dangerous
[40:42] but that's what the devil wants us to do
[40:46] because the devil's always got to find
[40:48] some way he's got he's got to have his
[40:49] punch at you
[40:52] hey Jay they're gonna get to you or he's
[40:54] gonna get to the ministry he's gonna get
[40:56] to your family well somehow he's got
[40:57] something that he's always going to stir
[40:58] the turmoil
[41:01] there's always there's always got to be
[41:03] some way he's going to get to you
[41:07] you know you know
[41:10] it was it was said one time and talking
[41:13] about talking about being a minister you
[41:15] know it's like you know they talk about
[41:16] us being moody and you know we we get
[41:19] bad attitudes and and different things
[41:21] and it's like well I don't I don't know
[41:23] if we do or not I mean I just know that
[41:25] you know if you ever try to study or or
[41:27] pray or something like that you know
[41:28] don't worry about it you know they won't
[41:30] say nothing to you all day long but as
[41:32] soon as you start to pray study then you
[41:34] know everything goes wrong and everybody
[41:36] wants to talk to you
[41:38] and you know it's it's always there's
[41:40] always something that goes on why
[41:42] because that's God you know because
[41:44] that's when God wants to speak to you
[41:45] the devil's going to hinder it
[41:50] hey what was it the message recognizing
[41:53] your day and its message and brother
[41:54] Brandon was talking about trying to he
[41:56] said he felt like the Lord was trying to
[41:57] talk to him and he said everything he
[41:59] done he said the food that he ate didn't
[42:01] settle with him and he said you know
[42:02] every time he said I was in the basement
[42:04] he said I was trying to pray I was
[42:06] trying to read he said I end up falling
[42:07] asleep he said it was just like I was
[42:09] the Lord was trying to talk to him he
[42:11] said everywhere I'd go he said I was
[42:12] trying to get there I was trying to hear
[42:14] from the Lord and he said it was just
[42:16] like the devil kept trying to hinder him
[42:17] the whole time but he said it felt like
[42:19] the Lord was trying to get to him he
[42:21] said the more he just but he had to keep
[42:23] pressing he had to keep pressing forward
[42:25] to get to get to the place that the Lord
[42:27] could speak to him
[42:29] you know Isaiah was saying is you know
[42:31] there's a blessing in the pressing
[42:33] so you got to keep pressing
[42:38] and so you know
[42:40] maybe maybe we are that you know maybe
[42:42] preachers are that way I don't know
[42:45] but you know I mean but that's that's
[42:46] the thing you've got to overcome that
[42:49] because you know that's just everyday
[42:50] life that's just that's and you know
[42:53] everybody's made different
[42:57] as brother random said you know when we
[42:59] get these things it's just the human
[43:00] grab bag you know we just have these
[43:02] things that come everybody's different
[43:04] everybody's personality is different
[43:06] there's different things that that you
[43:08] have to deal with
[43:10] but all these things that would come our
[43:12] way but you know we just keep pressing
[43:16] and you know whatever it is God's trying
[43:18] to reach us
[43:20] but the devil's always going to try to
[43:22] hinder that
[43:25] but we just keep pressing that battle
[43:30] see
[43:31] now this is from the the Mighty God
[43:34] unveiled
[43:36] and he Brethren's talking about he said
[43:38] in the Old Testament Genesis 1 in the
[43:40] beginning God
[43:42] it's about it's a self-existing one the
[43:44] Elohim
[43:46] said the difference in the word and it
[43:48] continues on about being self-existent
[43:51] and said we can't be that
[43:53] he said so God in the beginning was life
[43:55] the Eternal one he said in him was
[43:58] attributes and those attributes became
[44:00] words and the word became flesh Jesus
[44:01] was the Redeemer and to redeem means to
[44:04] bring back if he has to bring it back he
[44:07] had to be somewhere to be about back too
[44:10] so you see all people will never be able
[44:13] to see it because all people wasn't in
[44:16] the beginning and God's thoughts
[44:20] he said look at the priest he said when
[44:22] they see him Express himself exactly
[44:25] with the word
[44:26] what he said was they said it's
[44:28] Beelzebub
[44:30] they showed where they their nature was
[44:33] he said it was in the modern thought of
[44:35] the day
[44:38] but when the little prostitute when he
[44:40] met at that gate and told her expressed
[44:42] his Messiah signed by telling her what
[44:45] she had done he said why she said sir I
[44:47] perceive that you are a prophet we know
[44:50] the Messiah when he comes he will tell
[44:52] us all these things she was recognizing
[44:55] him as the Messiah the anointed one
[44:57] because he met the scripture
[44:59] qualifications don't you say the
[45:01] congregation says amen the two pieces of
[45:03] paper that were coming together she said
[45:05] we know that when the Messiah cometh
[45:07] so when he when she began to see these
[45:09] things as he was talking about they tie
[45:11] together they see
[45:13] because the the when Jesus came in he
[45:16] began to minister the the Pharisees
[45:18] didn't agree with him they didn't see
[45:19] these things but you know what it wasn't
[45:21] for them to see it because when he was
[45:23] when he was at Elohim when he was
[45:25] self-existing he had those attributes
[45:27] inside of him and it didn't matter where
[45:29] they came or where they were at the
[45:31] attribute of God is always going to be
[45:33] displayed it was coming to the place
[45:35] that God called it to and so here's this
[45:38] woman you know nobody nobody thought
[45:40] anything of her
[45:42] hey you know who who would have thought
[45:44] that she was the seed of God who would
[45:47] have thought that she was the one
[45:49] but here she's the one that come and
[45:51] when when they saw the same when she saw
[45:53] the same thing that the Pharisees saw
[45:55] then they called it the elzebub and they
[45:58] said that you're just you're just
[45:59] Anointed with the devil but when she saw
[46:01] it she saw that the scriptures had come
[46:03] alive when it began she saw the
[46:05] scriptures being manifested in front of
[46:07] her and said sir I perceive you to be a
[46:09] prophet because that's what the
[46:10] scripture says that would be done and
[46:12] you know what not only did she not see
[46:14] that she was he she saw a prophet but in
[46:17] the world greater Revelation that came
[46:19] to her through Jesus was when she said
[46:21] when the Messiah comes he'll do these
[46:24] things and he identified himself in the
[46:26] scripture too
[46:28] a lot of people thought well Jesus was
[46:30] just a prophet
[46:32] but they didn't see that he was the
[46:33] Messiah
[46:35] but she saw who he was why because when
[46:38] she received the word and she saw that
[46:41] God was working there that there had to
[46:43] be the hand of God that was working and
[46:45] when she saw that then said we know that
[46:48] when the Messiah comes he's going to do
[46:49] these things we're looking for the
[46:52] Messiah
[46:54] when we say God on the saying and
[46:56] working we know that's when the Messiah
[46:57] is coming one day we don't know when
[46:59] he's coming but we're looking for him
[47:02] and what a great thing was when she was
[47:04] looking for the Messiah she stood in
[47:06] front of the Messiah and he identified
[47:08] himself to her she began to see who he
[47:10] was
[47:15] right Brethren says and to see now God
[47:17] might have had to interpret this to that
[47:19] he said to get this certain Ting of the
[47:21] Bell like the motor when when Jesus
[47:23] turned he said I am he that speaks unto
[47:25] you there was no such an expression as
[47:28] Beelzebub she left her water part and
[47:30] ran into the City and said come see a
[47:32] man who told me the things that I have
[47:34] done isn't this the very Messiah see he
[47:37] said now what what did this putting the
[47:40] old scripture with the experience that
[47:42] Jesus was giving her
[47:44] what did it do it made the Messiah and
[47:48] did you notice quickly her sins were
[47:49] forgiven because at the beginning she
[47:51] was redeemable because she was in God's
[47:53] thinking at the beginning so it redeemed
[47:55] her brought her back when she seen the
[47:58] express scripture manifested of Jehovah
[48:00] what he was and what he is
[48:04] so when it became to the place that she
[48:06] began to see why because she was looking
[48:08] for something and when it was manifested
[48:10] in front of her she received it but
[48:12] because it was for her it was a fur her
[48:14] day and it was for a hard time it was
[48:17] hard time to receive it
[48:22] man it's the same way with you and our
[48:24] brothers and sisters
[48:25] Now's the Time to receive the word
[48:30] the word is made manifest now
[48:35] see many times people
[48:38] they missed what was what's been going
[48:41] on the movement of the Lord seeing the
[48:43] things that was taking place
[48:47] you know they they missed these things
[48:49] because they just it gloss over it or
[48:51] they don't catch it because they don't
[48:52] see what's taking place
[48:55] but you're hearing and once more Lord
[48:59] brother Adam speaking
[49:01] and he's talking about 1933. see
[49:04] Catching the things that's taking place
[49:06] and seeing what's what's been going on
[49:08] and what he says there and he talks
[49:10] about the morning that the the Holy
[49:12] Spirit Come and told him the seven
[49:13] things that was going to take place
[49:15] you know while the visions that he had
[49:18] was talking about what was going to take
[49:19] place
[49:20] now you know whether whether you believe
[49:23] this or not I believe it
[49:25] I believe it's thus saith the Lord now
[49:27] everybody else can spend the rest of
[49:29] their life trying to tear it down and
[49:31] say well listen it didn't really happen
[49:32] and and this or that well you know what
[49:34] y'all can you know they can do that or
[49:36] whoever you know whatever that's fine
[49:38] but you're to me it's life to me it's
[49:40] truth
[49:41] I believe these Saints took place amen
[49:45] when he began to talk about that and
[49:47] even brother Adam said you know he said
[49:48] he had those papers and he wrote them
[49:50] and he said people's come to the church
[49:52] and actually read what what he wrote
[49:54] what he prophesied in the church
[49:56] and you know people that were actually
[49:58] there that actually heard him say these
[50:00] things
[50:02] whether whether they believe that or not
[50:03] you know that's up to them but
[50:07] I'm just I'm just one that believes it's
[50:09] the truth
[50:10] I I just that's just me you know but
[50:13] when he talks about all these things
[50:15] taking place and he said you know they
[50:17] would elect the wrong president
[50:20] and uh right before the right before you
[50:23] get to the highlighted portion there he
[50:25] said and they said and this this would
[50:27] be a woman stand up and it would govern
[50:29] the United States not actually a woman
[50:30] but a church then we see her with
[50:33] nothing but ashes it's going to happen
[50:37] you know you say the the condition that
[50:40] the world is in and whether whether you
[50:42] believe it or not this this is this is
[50:44] for this is prophesied what's going to
[50:46] take place he said five of those things
[50:48] has perfectly been fulfilled exactly how
[50:51] Mussolini would rise and go to Ethiopia
[50:53] and fall at its steps and he would be
[50:56] turned to the people in shame with a
[50:57] woman many many years before it actually
[51:00] before it happened perfectly on the dot
[51:03] it's never failed and it won't fail
[51:04] because it's thus saith the Lord and
[51:07] it's not contrary to these Bible it's
[51:09] got to be
[51:11] so the things that people you know
[51:13] when that what people know about is it
[51:16] actually in the scripture are we
[51:17] actually looking at things that are in
[51:18] the scripture well you know you know
[51:20] there's a lot of things that you have to
[51:22] realize that when a prophet speaks it
[51:24] speaks according to the scripture why
[51:25] because if he's Vindicated according to
[51:28] the scripture then what he says is truth
[51:29] that he's speaking the truth but what's
[51:33] so amazing is well the one thing that
[51:34] brother Ram said that even the Bible
[51:36] tells us about the way that you can tell
[51:38] a prophet is right was when he says
[51:40] these things if it comes to pass
[51:45] so we know these things but you know the
[51:47] thing is is what happened what's your
[51:50] experience what God has spoke to you
[51:53] that's whether you can tell if it's true
[51:55] or not
[51:57] he continues on here and he's speaking
[51:59] of the organizations and everything and
[52:01] he says and she is making love to her
[52:03] daughters willing them right back again
[52:04] he said with no spiritual understanding
[52:08] stripped it's an oasis for her
[52:12] why because if you don't see the
[52:14] condition that the world is in oh it
[52:16] looks so wonderful
[52:18] see the condition they say oh it's what
[52:21] a grand thing it is oh my and
[52:23] Pentecostal men sitting in the council
[52:25] at Rome and sending letters around and
[52:27] said is it it was the most spiritual
[52:29] time they've ever seen
[52:33] How could a born-again man cut off his
[52:36] secret cut off the word and they live by
[52:39] a Creed that's exactly what Delilah has
[52:41] done today cutting off the word and you
[52:43] live by the creek
[52:46] when when brother Branham was standing
[52:49] there and telling them listen you can't
[52:51] follow into that old denomination
[52:52] because you were called out of it
[52:54] because he said come out and harm my
[52:56] people and touch not the unclean thing
[52:58] and when he began to identify the spirit
[53:01] of the age of what was going to take
[53:02] place and you can't mess with the
[53:04] denominations because there's a spirit
[53:06] on that and it's a spirit of antichrist
[53:08] and he's calling them back and he's
[53:10] calling the people back to the word and
[53:12] brother random standing there telling
[53:14] him what the scripture is and
[53:15] identifying the day and age in which we
[53:17] live and he kept telling them and yet
[53:19] they go right back to that
[53:21] why because they get under a spirit and
[53:24] an anointing well you can be anointed
[53:26] and have false words you can you can
[53:28] believe a lie and be anointed of the
[53:30] Holy Spirit
[53:33] oh what a wonderful thing but not
[53:35] realized yet and he said but they
[53:37] realized they were being cut off the
[53:40] word was being cut off from them just
[53:42] like Samson when he went in there and he
[53:43] laid in the lap of Delilah and had his
[53:45] had his Covenant cut off they the
[53:48] Pentecostals had the exact same thing
[53:50] because they thought they were qualified
[53:52] they thought they had the spiritual
[53:54] understanding when they stood there in
[53:55] the days of a prophet and he began to
[53:57] explain to them where they were at and
[53:59] understand they were devoid of the
[54:00] scripture they devoted the word
[54:04] just because you're anointed because the
[54:06] Holy Spirit falls on you whatever you
[54:08] say whatever happens is right
[54:13] and that's how that's how the devil
[54:15] could deceive the people
[54:20] brother Brown said the scripture says
[54:22] that that they would believe a lie and
[54:23] be damned by it why because they're
[54:26] following the anointing and not
[54:27] following the word
[54:31] it's not just by having anointing
[54:35] it's what the word says
[54:38] he said now look
[54:40] he said look at the defeat today
[54:42] he said from what it would be ministers
[54:44] instead of god-called Ministers of our
[54:47] Pinnacle Pentecostal group he said they
[54:49] had you have to have a doctorate degree
[54:51] before you get in the pulpit
[54:53] he said you got to have a fellowship
[54:55] card
[54:56] he said now in our great denomination of
[54:57] Pentecost before you send us send a
[54:59] missionary they got to send him before a
[55:01] psychiatrist see if he can stand the
[55:03] mental test
[55:08] he said he said see now that's right he
[55:10] said I wouldn't say that unless I could
[55:12] back it up see tell me if that's the
[55:14] qualification of a minister
[55:18] see God God didn't need some man to come
[55:20] up with some idea of what would take
[55:22] place
[55:23] well we we've got we've gotta we've got
[55:26] to have something to do with this
[55:28] no
[55:30] God started the church the way he wanted
[55:32] it
[55:33] and he kept the same way and if he
[55:36] qualified one man to lead and preach
[55:39] then guess what he kept them all the
[55:40] same
[55:42] yeah then you know what then they didn't
[55:43] have to have some kind of qualifications
[55:47] he said the Bible they never went before
[55:50] any psychiatrist but they waited in the
[55:53] city of Jerusalem until they were filled
[55:55] with power from on high
[55:57] hey some of them could not even write
[55:59] their name a few days later one passed
[56:01] through the gate called beautiful and he
[56:03] never seen them never been before a
[56:05] psychiatrist he never had his Fellowship
[56:07] card and he said such as I have I have
[56:10] never seen a fellowship card produce
[56:11] that
[56:13] why because they got to have their own
[56:15] ideas of how things ought to operate and
[56:18] not realizing that's totally opposite of
[56:20] what the word says He said what always
[56:22] he said we are stripped embarrassed in
[56:24] the presence of the Holy Ghost it
[56:26] certainly fulfills what the prophet said
[56:28] in second Timothy three it'd be heady
[56:30] High Mighty lovers of pleasure more than
[56:31] lovers of God
[56:33] well because they're totally stripped
[56:35] embarrassed in front of the Holy Ghost
[56:38] why because when the truth began to be
[56:40] known you know what it was when brother
[56:42] Branham was stood up and he began to
[56:43] speak to the to the Pentecostals and he
[56:45] began to tell him listen he said I'm not
[56:48] he said I was not disobedient to the
[56:50] heavenly vision and he began to talk
[56:52] about the same the same uh Ministry that
[56:55] Paul had and he began to talk about the
[56:57] things that meant that Paul went through
[56:59] and Paul was rejected by men and he
[57:01] rejected the the leaders of his day
[57:04] rejected solidly rejected his ministry
[57:06] and what he preached and he said listen
[57:08] it's the same way today the word has
[57:10] been made May restored in our day and he
[57:13] said it was totally rejected by man it
[57:16] was totally rejected by by the
[57:18] denominations and let me tell you
[57:20] something it's not just out there
[57:22] looking all these different places but
[57:23] let me tell you it's the same Spirit of
[57:25] the enemy today
[57:28] and he just changes he might change his
[57:30] dwelling place but let me tell you it's
[57:32] the same spirit and it's still as the
[57:34] word Goes Forth as the word as a bride
[57:37] goes continues on then guess what the
[57:39] spirit of the enemy the spirit that's
[57:41] going to continue to battle her is not
[57:43] going to be out there in the
[57:44] denominations it's going to be right
[57:46] around this message it's going to be
[57:48] right there standing because there's
[57:49] still going to be a mixed multitude
[57:51] that's going to stand in the way
[58:03] this is from
[58:05] God changed does God change his mind he
[58:07] said but I want you to say this in
[58:08] closing he said God never changed his
[58:10] mind
[58:12] now the Bible said Jesus Christ is
[58:14] saying yesterday today and forever now
[58:16] that don't mean in a certain way
[58:19] that means he's the same yesterday today
[58:21] and forever
[58:22] Jesus said in John 14 12 he that
[58:25] believeth on May the works that I do
[58:26] shall he do also is that right
[58:28] he promised in Mark 16 these shine shall
[58:32] follow them that believe
[58:33] he said no
[58:36] well that was just for the impossible he
[58:38] said go ye in all the world and preach
[58:40] the gospel to every creature these signs
[58:42] shall follow them all in all the world
[58:44] to every creature
[58:46] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[58:48] they shall speak with new tongues
[58:50] if they take up servants or drink deadly
[58:52] things it won't harm them if they lay
[58:54] their hands on the sick they shall
[58:56] recover he said now that's his
[58:58] qualification
[59:00] see when he try to qualify something we
[59:02] are trying to make qualify the church to
[59:04] what we think God's word is we can't
[59:07] qualify the church we've got to qualify
[59:09] to God
[59:11] we got to qualify to What God Says
[59:14] say God is God is the one that lays down
[59:17] the qualifications but the other thing
[59:19] is is that we actually have if we
[59:21] believe what God is saying what the
[59:23] qualifications are that you know what we
[59:25] still have the power to do the same
[59:26] thing
[59:28] that we still have the power
[59:32] that we still have the authority that
[59:33] it's still in in a force tonight
[59:37] and it's no matter where you think you
[59:39] are or who you are if you're a believer
[59:41] in the word
[59:43] even even the most lowest simplest
[59:46] person the least in the Kingdom still
[59:48] has the authority to and the still right
[59:50] to do that
[59:55] then you have the right to claim your
[59:57] god-given inheritance
[1:00:02] God has called us to that
[1:00:07] this is from the Smyrna Church age
[1:00:08] brother man says tongues
[1:00:10] he said tongues he said it's time to get
[1:00:13] back to God
[1:00:14] he said they have a name that they live
[1:00:16] but they are dead
[1:00:17] he said tongues this is the evidence of
[1:00:19] a Revival
[1:00:21] he said it's the evidence of death
[1:00:23] he said tanks proclaimed the evidence
[1:00:25] that the ceremonial religion of the Jews
[1:00:28] was over that a new era had begun
[1:00:29] tongues today is ringing down the
[1:00:31] curtain on the Gentile Church Aegis and
[1:00:34] the gospel is going back to the Jews
[1:00:36] people are talking about tongues
[1:00:38] heralding in a great spiritual move they
[1:00:41] have missed the boat the truth is that
[1:00:43] it is the writing the Finish to all of
[1:00:46] man's ideas programs and kingdoms and
[1:00:48] the kingdom of God is being ushered in
[1:00:50] and wake up people of God wake up
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] continuing on here he says he said if
[1:00:59] you don't think this is true just listen
[1:01:01] to this he said all over the world in
[1:01:03] both Pentecostal and fundamental groups
[1:01:05] they are organizing the businessmen they
[1:01:08] have invaded the pulpit without a call
[1:01:09] from God they have styled themselves the
[1:01:12] Fishers of Men and the founders of a
[1:01:14] move of God and they say the gifted
[1:01:17] Ministry of Ephesians 4 10-13 that God
[1:01:20] gave the church has failed and they are
[1:01:22] taking over here we are right in the
[1:01:25] midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:01:26] called The Gang sayings of Korah and
[1:01:28] they don't even know that they have
[1:01:30] fulfilled it they are blindly going on
[1:01:32] preaching experience for truth may God
[1:01:34] have pity on them may their eyes be open
[1:01:37] before it's too late
[1:01:39] so when you begin to see here he's
[1:01:41] talking about this great movement of God
[1:01:43] the Pentecostals oh well this is the
[1:01:45] great move of God here's the tongues
[1:01:46] that's going to take place and not
[1:01:48] realizing according to scripture when
[1:01:49] brother random said this is Judgment
[1:01:51] falling because now is the ending of the
[1:01:53] Gentile dispensation and it's now going
[1:01:56] back to the Jews and not realizing now
[1:01:58] is the end of the time when this was to
[1:02:01] take place and he began why because
[1:02:02] there had to be a prophet and listening
[1:02:04] to express this to tell the people what
[1:02:06] was going to take place
[1:02:08] and all this is a great move of God no
[1:02:10] the scripture tells us that when when uh
[1:02:13] in there in the scripture and have a
[1:02:16] good answer in them when they saw that
[1:02:17] they said you've been well found wait in
[1:02:20] the balance and found Walton
[1:02:23] when that when the scripture came down
[1:02:24] in the beginning they had and Daniel had
[1:02:26] to uh trans translate that interpret
[1:02:30] what was saying and realize that they
[1:02:32] were under judgment
[1:02:34] hey brother I said that was the end of
[1:02:36] the Gentiles
[1:02:37] and so when and now we've reached the
[1:02:39] end of the Gentiles and now it's going
[1:02:41] back to the Jews
[1:02:43] the head of the Jews
[1:02:45] so now the word is going back to the
[1:02:47] Jews it's the end of the Gentiles and he
[1:02:50] begins to talk about what does it take
[1:02:51] place and people not realizing what's
[1:02:53] taking place
[1:02:54] and when he when he stands here and he
[1:02:56] says see people are looking at these
[1:02:58] things and not realizing but that's what
[1:03:00] was to take place there was a there was
[1:03:02] a falling away from the scriptures
[1:03:04] because he said the that in the end time
[1:03:07] that he would fulfill the word but that
[1:03:09] would be a falling away
[1:03:12] that they're turning away from the
[1:03:13] scripture why because they they think
[1:03:15] they've got the truth and they don't
[1:03:18] and here they are he says they have
[1:03:20] turned away from this from the real true
[1:03:22] five-fold Ministry Amen brother I've
[1:03:25] said this there was a gifted Ministry of
[1:03:27] Ephesians 4.
[1:03:30] and what that's what struck me the other
[1:03:33] day when I was reading that he said that
[1:03:34] that God gave the church
[1:03:37] they've got to the place where they
[1:03:38] think the fivefold ministry God gave
[1:03:40] these he gave those gifts into the end
[1:03:43] of the body and these people have think
[1:03:45] they've qualified they're qualified to
[1:03:47] stand up and say this gifted Ministry of
[1:03:49] Ephesians 4 is failed
[1:03:53] and they've got they've got their own
[1:03:54] people that are raising up he was
[1:03:56] talking about the the
[1:03:58] the Full Gospel business man and brother
[1:04:00] Brown's standing there and tell him
[1:04:01] listen you are not called to be in the
[1:04:03] in the ministry you're not called to be
[1:04:05] in the pulpit
[1:04:07] but see then it's the same Spirit that's
[1:04:09] here today
[1:04:11] it's the exact same Spirit why because
[1:04:13] if if they stood back there and said the
[1:04:15] faithful Ministry it's not it's not any
[1:04:18] good it has fallen it has failed then
[1:04:20] guess what it's the same Spirit that's
[1:04:21] here today
[1:04:24] we don't have to have a faithful
[1:04:25] Ministry and he does anymore today why
[1:04:27] because it has failed and so all of a
[1:04:30] sudden it's the same spirit and it says
[1:04:32] they're raising up to take over
[1:04:34] which is exactly the same thing that we
[1:04:36] see today we don't need a five-fold
[1:04:38] Ministry why because we have the prophet
[1:04:40] we're just going to push play we're just
[1:04:42] going to hear what the prophet had to
[1:04:44] say well you know what that doesn't that
[1:04:46] does totally away with the with the word
[1:04:47] of God why because God was the one that
[1:04:49] called and started the the thoughtful
[1:04:51] Ministry and you don't you're not I
[1:04:53] don't care who you are you're not
[1:04:55] qualified to take them out
[1:05:01] say God put the gifts in the body and
[1:05:03] you're not we're not qualified to take
[1:05:05] them out
[1:05:10] but God is the one that controls all
[1:05:12] that
[1:05:14] see we see the same thing as it was with
[1:05:16] the gang saying of Cora
[1:05:18] oh we're we're just we're just knowing
[1:05:20] it as y'all are we've got the
[1:05:22] understanding God speaks to us too
[1:05:26] I wouldn't trust it no further than I
[1:05:28] could throw it
[1:05:32] but say that's the whole problem people
[1:05:33] got to the place where they don't even
[1:05:35] realize that it takes God to qualify
[1:05:37] somebody
[1:05:39] that's anointed of God God does the
[1:05:42] calling God does anointing God does the
[1:05:44] equipping
[1:05:47] so you
[1:05:50] brother babe says here in in the Patmos
[1:05:52] Vision he says he said you can't do any
[1:05:54] good until first you get in the spirit
[1:05:57] he said God can't use you
[1:06:00] he said he said all our all your efforts
[1:06:02] are in vain until you first get in the
[1:06:04] spirit
[1:06:04] he said if I sing I will sing in the
[1:06:06] spirit of I pray said Paul I spur I pray
[1:06:08] in the spirit then if there is anything
[1:06:11] that comes to me that's any good it's
[1:06:13] got to be revealed to me by the spirit
[1:06:15] and confirmed by the word
[1:06:19] made manifest by the results it bears
[1:06:23] say it's got to come by the word
[1:06:26] not just not just some kind of uh
[1:06:29] thought or idea but it's got to line up
[1:06:31] with the entire word
[1:06:33] it's got a dovetail with everything
[1:06:39] he said like in other words if I say
[1:06:41] Jesus Christ promising his word
[1:06:43] he said that if I would repent be
[1:06:44] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:06:46] said I will receive the gift of the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost the first thing for me to do is to
[1:06:50] repent
[1:06:55] he said be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:06:57] Christ if I I shall receive the gift of
[1:06:59] the Holy Ghost first thing for me to do
[1:07:01] is repent is revealed to me that that's
[1:07:03] true then be baptized in the name of
[1:07:06] Jesus Christ then the result says I'll
[1:07:09] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:07:14] he promised that if I would believe and
[1:07:17] have the Elders of the church anoint me
[1:07:18] with all pray over me in the prayer face
[1:07:20] shall save the sick he said Lord I
[1:07:22] believe yeah
[1:07:23] he said I follow your instructions
[1:07:27] then he continues on see we've got
[1:07:30] he said when God says anything it has to
[1:07:32] take place so when you meet God's
[1:07:34] qualifications just remember God will
[1:07:36] himself manifest himself and take care
[1:07:39] of it you just go ahead it's a finished
[1:07:41] work
[1:07:43] oh isn't that wonderful oh my just think
[1:07:46] God said you do this and I'll do this
[1:07:49] well if I go do this he's got to do that
[1:07:53] so then you've got to take him out his
[1:07:55] word and follow what he said
[1:07:57] but he spoke it then you've got to have
[1:07:59] it and believe it and it's got to be
[1:08:00] quick unto you by the scripture
[1:08:03] so if you believe that then if you've
[1:08:05] received the Holy Ghost if you've
[1:08:07] received a New Birth by following what
[1:08:09] the scripture says if you follow through
[1:08:12] that when you receive it then it will
[1:08:14] the scripture says that he will lead you
[1:08:16] and guide you into all truth now when he
[1:08:19] begins to lead you and begins to express
[1:08:21] these things to you the scripture says
[1:08:23] that in Acts 1 8 he said he said but ye
[1:08:26] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:08:28] has come upon you you shall be Witnesses
[1:08:30] unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and
[1:08:32] Samaria into the uttermost part of the
[1:08:34] Earth and then and this is from the
[1:08:37] message Witnesses he said now to be an
[1:08:39] witness he said witness must be first
[1:08:41] qualified
[1:08:42] in the courts of our land and Supreme
[1:08:44] Court they talk about being a you got to
[1:08:46] be examined before you can be a witness
[1:08:49] he said you got to stand by examination
[1:08:53] he said if you've got to do that he said
[1:08:55] how much more will the god of Heaven
[1:08:58] require an examination and a qualified
[1:09:01] witness before we are recognized in his
[1:09:03] sight as a correct Witness
[1:09:06] so he gave his commission to the
[1:09:08] disciples or the 120 that they should
[1:09:10] wait at Jerusalem until they are
[1:09:12] qualified to be Witnesses
[1:09:15] see that was a search specification that
[1:09:17] we must meet before we are qualified as
[1:09:19] a witness and this witness was to be
[1:09:20] this qualification was to be the coming
[1:09:23] of the promised Holy Spirit to fill the
[1:09:25] church with unction and the word unction
[1:09:29] comes from the Greek word Dynamite which
[1:09:31] means an explosion
[1:09:33] he must be something
[1:09:35] they must receive something before they
[1:09:37] can be a witness
[1:09:38] he said God never sends a man until
[1:09:40] first he has made him a qualified
[1:09:42] Witness
[1:09:44] so that we have to he said Lord somebody
[1:09:46] said somebody said they throw your case
[1:09:48] out
[1:09:49] you've got to be a right Witness
[1:09:52] you've got to have you've got to have
[1:09:54] seen something or heard something you
[1:09:56] got to know something
[1:09:58] they're not gonna have any hearsay
[1:10:01] you've got to know what you're talking
[1:10:02] about
[1:10:04] he said any turn any attorney knows that
[1:10:06] you cannot be a witness unless you have
[1:10:08] seen it for yourself not what somebody
[1:10:10] else said you have seen it and hear it
[1:10:12] either hear or see or hear before you
[1:10:15] can be a witness
[1:10:18] so you've gotta know and so when he
[1:10:20] calls you to be a witness it's it's for
[1:10:22] a real experience to you
[1:10:25] when you've received that that Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit when you when you've been brought
[1:10:29] in and you've been birthed into the body
[1:10:31] then you become a witness
[1:10:33] to know these things to be a witness why
[1:10:36] because when you stand up then your life
[1:10:37] becomes a witness to people then it's
[1:10:40] not just not just some idea but it's the
[1:10:42] truth
[1:10:43] what the scripture says becomes a
[1:10:45] manifestation in your life
[1:10:47] he said because when these things come
[1:10:49] then he said it would be a manifestation
[1:10:50] and the results will be the
[1:10:52] manifestation of the word
[1:10:54] so that's what our that's what our job
[1:10:56] is that's what our goal is
[1:10:59] for us to manifest these things
[1:11:03] you know what God Said and what God
[1:11:04] wants done with the word
[1:11:06] for us to understand who we are what God
[1:11:08] has called us to
[1:11:10] to realize God has qualified you to
[1:11:12] these things
[1:11:14] because you know if he's if he's pleased
[1:11:16] with you then that he gave you the Holy
[1:11:18] Ghost if he'd come up if he came to live
[1:11:21] inside of you if you come to take up
[1:11:23] residence in you to live through you
[1:11:26] to manifest himself to the world through
[1:11:28] you
[1:11:30] for you to be an overcomer
[1:11:33] it's not because Paul said it's no
[1:11:35] longer I that lived now but he said
[1:11:37] Christ that lives in me so you know what
[1:11:38] it's not me overcoming but it's him
[1:11:40] through me overcoming I can't overcome
[1:11:43] these things but it's him through me can
[1:11:45] overcome
[1:11:47] that I could realize that through him
[1:11:48] I'm an overcomer I'm more than a
[1:11:51] conqueror through him that loved me that
[1:11:52] I have to realize either this Reign on
[1:11:54] him
[1:11:55] well I just yield myself to him Lord I
[1:11:58] want you to be the Lord
[1:11:59] not just my savior I want you to be the
[1:12:01] Lord I want you to be the ruler of all
[1:12:03] things
[1:12:04] listen the Lord that's what I need
[1:12:09] this is from the from the message the
[1:12:11] statue of a perfect man
[1:12:15] and he says he said I want you to take
[1:12:17] it and study it and compare it and then
[1:12:19] act upon it
[1:12:21] see that's what God wants us to do to
[1:12:22] realize who we are what God is because
[1:12:24] these are requirements
[1:12:28] not not just not just to be born again
[1:12:30] so well I'm just I'm just in the family
[1:12:31] of God well that's good but you know
[1:12:33] what there's more than that that's
[1:12:34] required
[1:12:35] got it God has something he wants you to
[1:12:37] do he wants to there's a place for you
[1:12:41] it's like well I don't know why my place
[1:12:43] is well that's Now's the Time to be
[1:12:44] think you know praying about it and
[1:12:46] seeing what God wants you to do
[1:12:49] and realize God has equipped you to be a
[1:12:52] member a productive member of the body
[1:12:54] of Christ
[1:12:58] you know because everybody in the
[1:13:00] family's got a job and we all no matter
[1:13:02] how small or insignificant God gives us
[1:13:05] a job God places Us in the body and we
[1:13:07] don't we've got to do that portion
[1:13:10] because you know what without each
[1:13:13] individual person without each end of a
[1:13:15] member of the body you know we're
[1:13:17] incomplete
[1:13:19] we all have whether we think how we look
[1:13:22] at ourselves and realize well we look at
[1:13:24] ourselves as insignificant but you know
[1:13:26] what in the mind of God that's not the
[1:13:27] way God sees it
[1:13:30] God sees you as a valuable portion of
[1:13:33] the body a valuable part of the body God
[1:13:36] wants you to realize who you are
[1:13:39] well you because you know I want to look
[1:13:41] at say well I'm not this I'm not no God
[1:13:43] wants you to recognize Who You Are
[1:13:47] and our goal our our job should be our
[1:13:52] desire should be you know just be
[1:13:53] faithful to what God has called us to
[1:13:57] he said I want you he said I want you to
[1:13:58] take it and state it compare it and then
[1:14:00] act upon it he said don't just study and
[1:14:02] compare it but act upon it when you do
[1:14:05] take it seriously to yourself
[1:14:09] don't say well I enjoyed listening at it
[1:14:11] I did too but to listen at it and then
[1:14:14] receiving is different
[1:14:16] amen see see it's different see
[1:14:18] he said there is seven qualifications to
[1:14:21] make the stature of God
[1:14:23] they continues on the seven Church ages
[1:14:26] and talks about the number of completion
[1:14:29] and drops down
[1:14:31] brother Graham says he said let's add to
[1:14:33] our faith these things then we might
[1:14:36] come to the full stature of Christ being
[1:14:38] joined together with Godly love fear of
[1:14:40] God reverence in our heart to one
[1:14:42] another deep respect to one another
[1:14:44] brotherly and sisterly kindness
[1:14:48] never vulgarity
[1:14:50] nothing but just the purity of Holy
[1:14:52] Ghost living see live together be a
[1:14:55] Christian walk with faith let the virtue
[1:14:57] of God flow through you
[1:14:59] let the knowledge of God when it comes
[1:15:02] to right and wrong when the devil
[1:15:04] presents something that's not exactly
[1:15:06] scriptural walk away from it that's
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:10] he said I can imagine them Apostles
[1:15:13] never acted like us
[1:15:15] they went around probably men a few
[1:15:17] words until they got in the pulpit
[1:15:20] they walked in and done what they were
[1:15:22] supposed to do and walked and walked out
[1:15:24] yes sir they had power they advert you
[1:15:27] they had no arguments with men they know
[1:15:30] where they stood
[1:15:31] that's all they know who they believed
[1:15:34] they kept on walking in the spirit doing
[1:15:36] only
[1:15:38] he said just like I said the other night
[1:15:39] one little nod that's all had to do all
[1:15:42] God had to do then nothing going to stop
[1:15:44] them
[1:15:45] they didn't question and study in in hum
[1:15:48] Hall and and worry like we do whether we
[1:15:51] should do this or that they went ahead
[1:15:53] and done it anyhow
[1:15:55] just one little nod that done it just as
[1:15:57] soon why they they could how could they
[1:16:01] know it it was a nod from God they had
[1:16:03] all these virtues in here all these
[1:16:06] qualifications and this first little
[1:16:08] knot of God compared with every bit of
[1:16:10] this and with his word they note it was
[1:16:13] the word of God and away they went
[1:16:15] didn't have to worry about nothing else
[1:16:17] when God spoke they went
[1:16:21] he said and then
[1:16:23] this is from
[1:16:25] Blasphemous names then when we have met
[1:16:28] these qualifications
[1:16:30] and become full of the virtues of God
[1:16:32] and the things of God then the Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit comes down and seals us into the
[1:16:35] kingdom don't know don't worry
[1:16:38] everybody will know you got it
[1:16:41] you won't have to say well glory to God
[1:16:43] I know I got it I spoke with tongues the
[1:16:45] Lord of God I know I got it I danced in
[1:16:47] the spirit once you won't have to say a
[1:16:49] word about it everybody will know you
[1:16:51] got it don't you worry yeah it'll
[1:16:54] testify for itself he will let it be
[1:16:57] known
[1:16:57] among men
[1:16:59] amen so that's that's my desire Lord I
[1:17:02] want to be
[1:17:04] to the place that God's God can work
[1:17:07] through me and that people can see God

[1:17:37] have these virtues
[1:17:41] and if he's made a way
[1:17:43] then he said then you don't have to
[1:17:45] worry about it
[1:17:47] if God's on the inside to be made
[1:17:49] manifest
