[26:08] because I didn't tell anybody I want to
[26:09] do this but the Lord just put it on my
[26:11] heart I want to give a thank
[26:15] everybody for the
[26:17] prayers the
[26:19] food and uh
[26:22] visitations the hospital and everything
[26:26] that everybody's done
[26:30] uh it was kind of a shock to me what
[26:33] took place
[26:34] but I had to I'm going to tell you
[26:37] something I've never told anybody except
[26:40] Janet I just told her this last year
[26:43] that I'd had for a long time I had a
[26:46] dream that I was being cut
[26:49] open and I would have a death
[26:53] moan and it was horrible and it would
[26:55] wake her up and scare her and I say that
[27:00] because of the things that uh have taken
[27:02] place but and I turned as I was leading
[27:06] singing over the last couple months when
[27:08] I get through a service I would turn to
[27:10] Donnie and Esther and I'd say the Lord
[27:13] has given me the scripture in a little
[27:15] while you'll see me no
[27:17] more and I would say that for weeks
[27:21] because I'd get to about third song and
[27:23] I couldn't even
[27:25] breathe I'd be totally out of breath and
[27:28] uh I've had three physicals and the
[27:31] doctors would tell me you're in perfect
[27:33] shape for your age uh you know I had set
[27:37] goals in my life I wanted to get to
[27:38] three score
[27:39] 10 man that was close but I made it
[27:42] praise the
[27:43] Lord
[27:48] uh but I had uh I set goes my life and I
[27:52] want to encourage all the young people
[27:53] to set a goal and meet it I met everyone
[27:56] I set praise the Lord
[27:58] when I retired at 62 that was my goal
[28:02] and that was my major accomplishment
[28:05] but I just want to touch on a couple
[28:08] things they kept telling me uh I said I
[28:11] want this calcium test I said you don't
[28:13] need it you're in perfect shape I've had
[28:15] three physicals and said you're in great
[28:17] shape and I they I kept talking to them
[28:20] they said well it's going to cost you
[28:21] $90 and I said I don't care I want it so
[28:25] I go in there and get the test and the
[28:26] score comes back at 13
[28:28] 1438 on uh on my calcium which is
[28:32] supposed to be less than
[28:34] 300 and uh so they sent me in for a hard
[28:37] Cath and was going to do a uh check me
[28:40] out for a hard Cath and see what kind of
[28:43] problems I had and I had what they found
[28:45] out I had 23
[28:47] blockages and uh so that was uh on a
[28:51] Wednesday they come back said Amazon
[28:54] don't have enough stin I can buy in a
[28:55] package to do this on you you're going
[28:58] to have to go home we're going to have
[28:59] to do a
[29:00] bypass so when they got in there to they
[29:04] did some more testing and they realized
[29:06] that I needed five
[29:08] bypasses uh I had one and I have a a
[29:13] picture of this at some point but I had
[29:15] uh 90% blockages and about the rest of
[29:19] them were 70 70%
[29:22] blockages so they decide they need to
[29:25] bypass well I just happened to be the
[29:27] third person in 40 years the doctor seem
[29:29] to stirred them like I have so when they
[29:32] went to do the bypasses they couldn't
[29:34] get to the back one so one of them they
[29:36] ended up doing four uh because I have a
[29:38] high race sternum and the kids used to
[29:41] kid me about they could eat cereal off
[29:43] my chest uh because of the way my chest
[29:46] was risen
[29:48] but uh but they said I was a third state
[29:53] person that 30 years they seen with that
[29:55] type of chest
[29:59] cavity so we go and have the surgery
[30:01] everything's great brother Tony he was
[30:03] with me
[30:07] always brother Wade God
[30:10] bless every
[30:13] day i' I go to sleep I'd wake up Tony
[30:17] still be S God
[30:20] bless I'd go to sleep come back he's
[30:22] still there
[30:28] but I just want to tell
[30:31] you the prayers of the Saints is what
[30:34] got me through so we had the surgery
[30:37] they did four bypasses I had a lung
[30:40] collapse during surgery when I come out
[30:42] I had a little bit of difficulty didn't
[30:45] know what was going on and they don't
[30:47] tell you nothing right after surgery you
[30:50] learned a lot of stuff till three days
[30:52] later which I don't think is right but
[30:54] they did
[30:56] that and then after a few days and one
[30:59] thing you don't do when you come out of
[31:00] heart
[31:01] surgery is uh the TV being on and
[31:03] watching Star Trek where they're zapping
[31:05] everybody I mean you just don't do that
[31:08] and that happened to be on the TV when I
[31:10] come back in the room
[31:12] but uh after two or three days I I got
[31:15] to work and only say one word because my
[31:18] chest cavity was filling up with fluid
[31:20] and they decided that the I forget what
[31:23] they call that but they had to put me in
[31:25] the take me down and put a tube in my
[31:27] back
[31:28] and it drained my back of that fluid and
[31:30] it actually sounded like a bathtub water
[31:32] running it was incredible and it was bad
[31:36] but after that everything's been great
[31:39] but uh he told me he said because I
[31:41] didn't have a heart attack that I my
[31:43] heart's going to recover just I'm doing
[31:45] better than they really expected and uh
[31:48] I'm just so grateful for everybody's

[32:41] machines I had take him off him if it
[32:44] was his the Lord's will to bring him up
[32:47] he would have brought him up but it

[41:01] that time father I pray that you'd bless
[41:03] each one now forgive us of our sins
[41:05] Jesus name we pray and the saint said
[41:08] amen all right let's read 1 Corinthians
[41:11] 2:9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen
[41:15] Nor Ear heard neither have entered into
[41:17] the heart of man the things which God
[41:20] hath prepared for who for them that love
[41:23] him so there's only a special group of
[41:25] people that's going to understand God
[41:27] know what he
[41:29] said and be happy and only one group of
[41:32] people that's right for those of whom
[41:34] that love him not not FOH him agap him
[41:38] in other words have the new birth but
[41:40] God hath revealed them unto us by his
[41:43] spirit for the spirit searches all
[41:45] things yay the Deep things of God for
[41:48] what man knoweth the things of a man
[41:50] save the spirit of the man which is in
[41:51] him as we said before we live in a
[41:54] spiritual being we we live in a
[41:57] spiritual being we have human we have
[41:59] human skin but we have a spiritual life
[42:02] because even even our thoughts even the
[42:04] things that we do at things that are
[42:06] that are that are um you know we do in
[42:08] like memory reason conscious affection
[42:09] imagination that is a spirit realm all
[42:12] right but we're talking about the soul
[42:14] now God's talking here Paul is telling
[42:16] us he said now there's a natural man
[42:18] that understands the natural life we do
[42:21] all right but then now watch even so the
[42:23] things of God knoweth no man but the
[42:26] spirit of God
[42:27] all right so it's a special group of
[42:29] people as brother R said a special class
[42:31] of people now listen we're not to
[42:34] separate
[42:35] ourself let God separate us your actions
[42:39] will separate
[42:41] yourself your actions will immediately
[42:44] separate yourself from the world now we
[42:47] have received not the spirit of the
[42:48] world but the spirit which is of god
[42:50] that we might know the things that are
[42:51] freely given look freely given to us of
[42:54] God you may be seated the Lord at his
[42:55] Blessing to the reading the word the
[42:57] door is open go in and get what you need
[43:01] it's not closed anymore it's not we're
[43:03] not wandering around and wondering if
[43:05] this is right and wondering if that is
[43:07] right we know what's right we know truth
[43:10] you should know today that this is truth
[43:13] what you're what you're sitting in today
[43:15] not your natural seat not this natural
[43:17] building not hearing my natural voice
[43:19] but this message of the hour is so dear
[43:22] to each one of us it's part of our being
[43:26] it's our language
[43:27] as we were talking about brother Dutch
[43:29] and I we we had our a little get
[43:31] together Friday night over some dinner
[43:34] and we are the only people that
[43:39] understand why God
[43:42] came why he came to a special group of
[43:45] people why he had to send us a
[43:48] prophet to straighten everything out as
[43:50] we were talking about Wednesday night he
[43:52] had to restore the original Doctrine
[43:54] back to the church the original doct
[43:58] he didn't bring a different Doctrine He
[43:59] restored the original doctrine that was
[44:02] in the first two or three Church ages
[44:04] before man got a hold of it and what
[44:06] they diluted it and we'll read you a
[44:08] quote here in just a minute so what
[44:10] happened was is listen you can't dilute
[44:13] the word of
[44:14] God but man through man's filter dilutes
[44:19] the word of God the the word of God's
[44:22] always been powerful the word of God is
[44:24] not like a graph right it's straight is
[44:27] eternal we just got to attach oursel to
[44:29] the right piece because you know some
[44:32] people are preaching today that the word
[44:35] of God is a trinity that the word of God
[44:37] is father son Holy Ghost
[44:40] baptism don't believe what we believe s
[44:42] in this building contrary to what we
[44:45] believe and they say that's the word of
[44:48] God so how are we going to know the
[44:51] difference we're going to know the
[44:52] difference by the spirit that's inside
[44:54] of us I tell you one more time and I'll
[44:57] tell you another time if you have the
[44:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[45:02] you can never ever turn this message
[45:05] down you cannot do that because the Holy
[45:08] Ghost the token for this hour is the
[45:10] message of the hour and we don't get in
[45:12] it we're out of
[45:14] it you be all right with that this is
[45:18] it Coke for years said this is it well
[45:23] Coke ain't it Coca-Cola is all right to
[45:25] drink but this is it
[45:28] this is what God purposed this is what
[45:30] God put us on the earth for he put us in
[45:32] the right time the right place and even
[45:34] the right mentality to hear from
[45:37] God because down through the church ages
[45:40] somebody has stood behind the pull pit
[45:42] and told them
[45:46] lies sorry anything
[45:50] false from the word of God is a liar and
[45:54] it ain't true right I'm sorry
[45:57] you said oh what about Luther and Wesley
[45:59] they had their time that they preached
[46:01] false Doctrine but they had their time
[46:03] that they told us and showed us that to
[46:05] just shall live by faith absolutely and
[46:07] then when God moved man stayed still we
[46:11] just went through the church ages when
[46:13] when God moved Lutheran Stood Still
[46:16] Wesley Stood Still They had a time but
[46:19] now you and I this transition to
[46:21] perfection even comes from we're not
[46:23] looking at 1963 anymore we're not
[46:25] looking at 196
[46:27] anymore we're in
[46:30] 2025 never would we have thought 20
[46:33] years ago that's right that we would
[46:35] have to buy a calendar that said
[46:37] 2025 and that I would have a Medicare
[46:39] card in my
[46:43] pocket what' I just
[46:45] say so let's let's turn to Matthew 13
[46:50] the reason I'm I'm approaching it like
[46:52] this is I know for a fact there's some
[46:55] people that struggle with deep
[46:59] teaching now deep teaching is just
[47:02] something that we
[47:04] say not to scare you I just read you
[47:07] that you love the Deep things of God
[47:10] brother B said we love what is
[47:11] revelation Revelation is the Deep things
[47:13] of God okay and we'll read that in just
[47:16] a little while the doctrine that you
[47:18] live by is actually permeated in your
[47:21] being the doctrine you live by is what
[47:24] you work by it's what you play by come
[47:27] on it's what you have your everyday life
[47:30] by it's all connected to the word of God
[47:34] if you're born again if you're not born
[47:36] again praise God you're in if you're in
[47:38] your journey that's fine just remember
[47:40] there is a time when God will not wink
[47:42] at your
[47:43] ignorance he won't wink at my
[47:46] ignorance he call every person to
[47:49] repent and come to the baptism of the
[47:51] Holy Ghost am that's why many times we
[47:55] and me and another brother we're talking
[47:57] the other
[47:58] day the time and and this is true listen
[48:02] the time of us preaching that you need
[48:04] to come to church ever service is
[48:08] over if you don't know it by now if you
[48:11] don't know you need to be here when that
[48:12] door opens that's your problem that's
[48:15] the truth and you can make 50,000
[48:17] excuses if you want to you're not making
[48:19] them to me you're not making them to
[48:20] congregation you making them to God
[48:23] everybody with me all right I just
[48:25] believe that God said he'd meet us here
[48:28] and this is where I need to be right
[48:30] here
[48:32] regardless don't start giving excuses
[48:34] you give them to God don't give them to
[48:35] me give them to God right why you can't
[48:38] get to church but a holy ghost filled
[48:41] person will come to church you don't
[48:43] have to teach that anymore you don't
[48:44] have to teach a woman that's filled with
[48:45] the Holy Ghost that she don't need to
[48:47] cut her
[48:50] hair so that's where we're getting to
[48:53] where Paul is saying leaving the
[48:55] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[48:56] us go on to Perfection you can't sit
[48:59] here every service and sisters come in
[49:02] every service now I'm talking about I'm
[49:03] talking about new people you know I
[49:05] don't I'm not talking about new people
[49:08] if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:09] today and you just come into the message
[49:11] of the hour and your hairs are short as
[49:13] mine your hair is as long as a sister
[49:15] sitting beside you you just got to prove
[49:17] it by letting it continue to grow
[49:20] everybody with me on that all right so
[49:22] let's just be as brother Bob was talking
[49:24] about let's don't be too quick to judge
[49:26] last Sunday was teaching on that which
[49:28] is very good let's don't be so quick but
[49:30] you've got to come to a time to where if
[49:32] you've been here for 6 months8 months or
[49:34] a year or even 15 20 years in this
[49:36] message y'all not be told you need to
[49:38] come to church yall not be told you
[49:40] don't need to wear pants yall not be
[49:42] told these
[49:46] things why because we got to go on to
[49:49] Perfection and Perfection is what laying
[49:52] aside all the other things and remember
[49:54] we'll get into it in just a minute Paul
[49:56] wasn't saying do away with
[49:58] everything you can't do away with the
[50:00] word of God you can't do away with the
[50:02] foundation of this building this
[50:04] building it doesn't matter if we tear it
[50:06] down the foundation will still be here
[50:08] there's a foundation that we live on
[50:11] which is
[50:12] Doctrine and that Doctrine
[50:17] moves that Doctrine moves God doesn't
[50:20] stay still God moves man stays still all
[50:23] right now Matthew
[50:25] 13:5 now this is the soore the seed the
[50:27] seed's the word of God the soar is the
[50:29] son of man so we're talking about a
[50:30] preacher preaching to you and what
[50:32] taking the word of God and throwing the
[50:34] seed out today I'm planting
[50:36] seed today there's seed being planted
[50:39] you've got to realize where to put
[50:43] it some fell upon Stony places watch
[50:46] some of that seed some of that word
[50:48] which they had not much
[50:51] Earth in other words you let your body
[50:55] override your mind
[50:57] oh you I'm sorry I'm preaching to
[50:59] somebody else I'm I'm preaching to
[51:00] myself today cuz I'll let that happen a
[51:02] good bit
[51:04] okay and forth with they sprang up we
[51:08] started coming to church we started
[51:09] being happy with the message of the hour
[51:11] this is the greatest thing since sliced
[51:13] bread why do we always say slic bread
[51:15] it's the greatest thing since
[51:19] gasoline it's just
[51:23] wonderful we've had many people come
[51:25] through this church I don't many few s
[51:28] on the front row no offense sat on the
[51:31] front row clap praise God rais their
[51:34] hands say this ain't nothing but the
[51:35] truth shouted 6 months later they're in
[51:39] a Baptist Church so what did they have
[51:42] they got a feeling they got an anointing
[51:45] of the word of God that's right there
[51:49] was a seed
[51:51] planted was there was a seed planted but
[51:54] they had no deepness of Earth in other
[51:56] they didn't let it sink all the way into
[51:58] their soul cuz I'll say it one more time
[52:01] you can't be influenced by the message
[52:03] of the hour have the new birth and turn
[52:06] it down you can't do that you might be
[52:09] foolish virgin you might think you're
[52:11] saved you're
[52:13] not sorry it's black and white No Gray
[52:16] and go no gray that's why the new birth
[52:19] brother rown said was the most important
[52:21] thing you could have not that you could
[52:23] read a message book faster than somebody
[52:25] else not that you can listen to more
[52:26] tapes than somebody else it's what you
[52:29] do with what you
[52:31] got so the preacher's preaching he's
[52:33] sewing a seed and there's somebody
[52:35] sitting there in the
[52:37] congregation they're enjoying it they're
[52:39] soaking up the the you know the
[52:41] atmosphere of
[52:42] God but they got to walk out that
[52:45] door and go out in the world you and I
[52:49] same thing if we have to work we got to
[52:50] go right out the door tomorrow and go to
[52:53] work and when the sun was up
[52:58] hot trials
[53:02] tribulations when the sun was up they
[53:05] were
[53:07] scorched what that tender plant that had
[53:09] been
[53:10] planted and because they had no
[53:13] root they withered
[53:17] away brother Luis is not here today but
[53:19] he'll tell
[53:20] you when he first started coming to
[53:22] church here about 10 or 12 years ago may
[53:24] have been longer than that
[53:27] he came from another church and came
[53:29] here and sat down and you know he'd
[53:31] already heard that that dad was a good
[53:33] teacher and and you had to listen you
[53:35] had to pay attention you had to pay
[53:36] attention to that cuz he was a good
[53:38] teacher best one I've ever heard in the
[53:39] message of the hour ever zero Barone
[53:43] amen but you got to sit and
[53:46] listen if you listen to two or three
[53:48] sermons and you say I don't know I I
[53:50] just can't and leave then I brother Lise
[53:52] said I stayed I stayed and I prayed
[53:57] he said about 6 months later he got to
[53:59] where I he said I got to where I could
[54:01] understand what your dad was
[54:04] saying he had the Holy Ghost that's what
[54:07] it was that was the key if the Holy
[54:09] Ghost you just let the Holy Ghost work
[54:11] in your life he'll tell you something he
[54:15] can't deny the word of God and as deep
[54:17] as you want to go in the word of God
[54:19] he's got to he's got to already be there
[54:22] to give it to you right and he knew you
[54:25] would come to him it or
[54:28] not because they had no deepness of
[54:30] Earth and when the sun was up there were
[54:32] Scorch Trials tribulations somebody
[54:35] questioning their uh this brandom
[54:38] man right had a pastor called me two
[54:40] nights
[54:41] ago he said I had a man raised up in my
[54:44] church while I was
[54:45] preaching and denied the message denied
[54:49] what he was
[54:50] preaching and it troubled the
[54:53] brother it would trouble me too
[54:57] and he didn't tell me who it was I don't
[54:58] care but he said it was really close to
[55:00] him but it wasn't his wife he said he
[55:02] said he just he stood up and said a c
[55:04] didn't just stand up he said a couple of
[55:06] words brother oh I almost said his name
[55:08] brother was preaching and the brother
[55:09] said no that ain't right listen and you
[55:13] know what it was are you ready are you
[55:15] ready for this great
[55:16] bombshell okay I'm going to say it slow
[55:18] so they can interpret so brother thank
[55:20] God for brother brother Manuel back
[55:22] there interpreting thank God God sent
[55:25] him here
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:29] and his family to help us out to help
[55:32] our my whole prayer was to help the
[55:34] people that's coming now the Hispanic
[55:37] people the ones that need to hear the
[55:39] word of God in their language and I'm
[55:42] sorry I can't speak it I can barely
[55:44] speak this
[55:46] one but you know what the brother had a
[55:49] problem with one quote brother Brown
[55:52] says I wouldn't have a Cadillac if
[55:53] somebody gave me one it's a quote
[55:55] somewhere I don't know I don't care
[55:57] about these things but he said brother
[56:00] brandham was given a Cadillac in 1963 or
[56:03] he had the
[56:04] date that was his whole argument that
[56:07] the message was
[56:14] wrong no depth of
[56:16] God that person didn't have on your
[56:19] birth no if you're going to argue over
[56:21] what our Prophet
[56:22] drove we're in trouble no you're in
[56:25] trouble right I don't care if he drove a
[56:27] tricycle come on and said he'd never
[56:30] ride one he was a human being yes sir he
[56:34] had human desires but when that man
[56:37] stood under the inspiration of the Holy
[56:38] Ghost that was God Almighty speaking to
[56:41] us not another person that was God
[56:44] Almighty speaking to us through a
[56:47] conduit of a
[56:49] man man has always stumbled with the
[56:53] flesh brother R said it's hard to get
[56:55] one man to believe another man why cuz
[56:57] we're all human we all see our flaws we
[56:58] all see our
[56:59] mistakes and we have
[57:03] them lot of the things brother R said
[57:05] was his opinion I'm going to tell you
[57:08] some things that's my opinion my dad for
[57:10] 50 years told you some things that was
[57:12] his opinion cuz we're human beings right
[57:16] but when that word of God comes and you
[57:18] say that ain't nothing but the
[57:20] truth hady R didn't have a problem with
[57:23] it she said that ain't nothing but the
[57:25] truth brother and what it was something
[57:27] he was
[57:28] telling if you say today that ain't
[57:30] nothing but the truth may God grant you
[57:31] what you need today may God give you
[57:34] your children your family your wife your
[57:36] friends
[57:39] anybody but it takes saying the right
[57:41] thing yes everybody with me
[57:45] yes so now what's
[57:48] happening we see that when brother R
[57:51] comes on the scene in in 47 he starts
[57:53] preaching in the 30s but in 47 we start
[57:56] hearing the
[57:58] message and what he's doing is is he's
[58:00] not bringing something new he's he's
[58:02] he's getting us back to the faith of the
[58:04] fathers what is the faith of the fathers
[58:07] it's what they believed in the first
[58:08] church
[58:09] age everybody with me we're just we were
[58:12] just a bunch of babblin babies bunch of
[58:14] children that cried about
[58:17] everything they didn't
[58:19] cry Peter didn't cry when that man
[58:23] said I'm blind or or I can't walk Peter
[58:26] says Silver and Gold Have I None but
[58:28] what I have I'll give to you in the name
[58:30] of Jesus Christ W rise up and walk they
[58:33] didn't have to confer with the bishop
[58:35] they didn't have to read 10 message
[58:36] books come on somebody there wasn't even
[58:38] a Bible there at the time they were just
[58:41] going on here
[58:43] say what God Said but it wasn't hear say
[58:46] on the day of
[58:48] Pentecost they knew what brother they
[58:51] knew what brother Jesus they knew what
[58:52] brother Jesus had been saying for three
[58:54] and a half years right and they acted on
[58:57] it as we were talking about
[58:59] Wednesday God has a real sense of
[59:03] humor if you'll go to Second Peter
[59:06] second Peter wrote the book of
[59:09] Peter said now having divine nature of
[59:12] God he said
[59:15] add
[59:17] Faith the very man they cut off a man's
[59:22] ear in the garden right have
[59:26] virtue he cursed three
[59:31] times have knowledge the only knowledge
[59:34] Peter had was is
[59:36] fight that was his whole that was his
[59:38] whole knowledge remember Jesus was
[59:40] always telling him Peter I'm praying for
[59:42] you well now that Peter's got the Holy
[59:44] Ghost and he had all he was a naked
[59:46] fisherman that cussed how much worse can
[59:48] you get he brings us these and he lives
[59:52] them and we see them in his life we see
[59:54] them in the message that he brought
[59:56] that God had changed his life and God
[59:58] used a naked fisherman that cursed to
[1:00:01] bring us to way for us to live in this
[1:00:03] day and time now listen back then they
[1:00:06] didn't have where they put it in this
[1:00:08] statue of a perfect man but brother
[1:00:10] randam that's what he come to do he come
[1:00:11] to restore all this back yes to show us
[1:00:15] we had Church ages to show us that we
[1:00:17] had Church age Messengers and who they
[1:00:23] were but in the first church age
[1:00:26] there wasn't a church on the corner that
[1:00:28] had a trinity on
[1:00:30] it there weren't Church on the corner
[1:00:33] that said the First Baptist Church
[1:00:35] of
[1:00:37] Jerusalem we have that
[1:00:40] now I told you if you'll go back and
[1:00:42] read some of the history I've been
[1:00:43] reading some of the books that one of
[1:00:44] them's called anatomy of a hybrid it's
[1:00:46] how we got hybridized from the first
[1:00:48] church and it wasn't written by met
[1:00:50] believer
[1:00:53] either Jee we read those
[1:00:56] books yeah we read those books sorry
[1:00:59] amen cuz he was telling the
[1:01:01] truth what happened was they hybridized
[1:01:04] and brother Brown preached all that
[1:01:05] already how they hybridized the word of
[1:01:07] God am but what they literally done was
[1:01:11] is they killed the son of man again they
[1:01:14] killed him the first time 2,000 years
[1:01:16] ago
[1:01:17] right physically killed
[1:01:20] him now we know that the end time
[1:01:23] brother randam had to indict a
[1:01:25] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:01:28] Christ cuz they did it again they put
[1:01:31] him on a cross and according to Matthew
[1:01:35] 17:9 Elijah is going to come and restore
[1:01:38] all things not just part
[1:01:40] all and as they came down from the
[1:01:42] mountain Jesus charged him saying tell
[1:01:44] the vision to no man until the son of be
[1:01:46] man be risen again from the dead he knew
[1:01:48] he was going to have to
[1:01:50] die but I don't know if he knew it or
[1:01:52] not he was prophesying there'll come a
[1:01:54] time when kill me
[1:01:58] again and his disciples asked him saying
[1:02:01] why didn't the say say the scribes that
[1:02:02] the last must first come and Jesus
[1:02:05] answered and said unto them Elias truly
[1:02:07] shall first come and restore all things
[1:02:09] now that wasn't John the Baptist John
[1:02:11] the Baptist was an introducer he
[1:02:12] introduced the Messiah he was not a
[1:02:15] restorer we need we need a restorer as
[1:02:18] what being the pastor was talking a
[1:02:21] couple nights
[1:02:22] ago I if if somebody ever comes up to
[1:02:24] you and and starts talking talking about
[1:02:26] what brother R did or didn't
[1:02:28] do just stop him and say all right look
[1:02:31] Malachi 4 you can't take that out of the
[1:02:33] Bible right Malachi 4 is in the Bible 4
[1:02:38] 5 and 6 he promised he would send me an
[1:02:41] Elijah the prophet before the end
[1:02:44] time where is he if you can find him let
[1:02:48] me
[1:02:50] know most of the time they won't really
[1:02:53] know what you're talking about and they
[1:02:54] sure can't take you to somebody else
[1:02:56] so I'll just stay with this y'all don't
[1:02:58] mind I'll just stay right here this is
[1:02:59] this is good enough for me if he made a
[1:03:01] mistake so what he was
[1:03:03] human I like what brother dick Addison
[1:03:05] said he said I don't care if they proved
[1:03:07] that brother brandham had five wives and
[1:03:10] had four or five girlfriends he said
[1:03:12] that man's word took me to the to the
[1:03:15] God that I know
[1:03:18] now listen every prophet in the Old
[1:03:22] Testament had a
[1:03:24] flaw they were
[1:03:26] murderers they
[1:03:29] were
[1:03:32] prostitutes they were a lot of bad
[1:03:34] things but God used them to bring the
[1:03:37] word through but we know for a fact let
[1:03:40] me just get this straight brother R
[1:03:41] didn't have all that he was a human
[1:03:43] though that human mistakes he had human
[1:03:46] ideas apart from this word of God he
[1:03:48] didn't have an idea on the word of God
[1:03:49] now now when it comes to Doctrine you
[1:03:52] can't you can't tell me that's that he
[1:03:55] was wrong in
[1:03:56] Doctrine now if he was wrong in Doctrine
[1:03:59] which he said he was opening the seals
[1:04:01] we'll get to it that transition to
[1:04:04] Perfection mean it wasn't at first it
[1:04:06] was partial but brother R stood on the
[1:04:08] first seal and I've got the seal book
[1:04:10] part of it here he stood on the first
[1:04:12] seal and he said I would have made a
[1:04:13] horrible mistake I was looking at my old
[1:04:16] nose cuz he had preached a white horse
[1:04:18] rider was the Holy Ghost 1957 58 or 59
[1:04:23] Mighty conqueror he read Revelation 6
[1:04:25] and said that was the holy ghost riding
[1:04:27] through the church
[1:04:28] ages but he corrected yes sir you don't
[1:04:33] correct a prophet and nobody corrects a
[1:04:37] prophet but
[1:04:38] God he don't stand before nobody but God
[1:04:41] that's why that's why I told him the
[1:04:43] other day I said look 1100 sermons
[1:04:47] thousands of things that happen
[1:04:49] supernaturally millions of people's been
[1:04:52] healed Millions upon Millions have been
[1:04:55] saved under his ministry millions of
[1:04:58] people been in put in the sixth
[1:04:59] Dimension because of his
[1:05:01] ministry where's the
[1:05:04] fault right y you can find a fault but I
[1:05:08] mean you can't find the false in this
[1:05:11] message there is no false because it's
[1:05:14] the son of man just what he this is the
[1:05:16] son of man standing here on the mountain
[1:05:18] right son of man standing on the
[1:05:21] mountain he said Jesus answered and said
[1:05:23] Eli truly shall first come and restore
[1:05:26] all things and we know who that was that
[1:05:29] was Malachi 4 everybody with me now
[1:05:33] brother R tells us he said I mentioned
[1:05:35] it would take the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:05:38] Revelation look or we will fail to get
[1:05:42] it bringing these two thoughts together
[1:05:45] you will see that it won't take just
[1:05:47] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:05:48] book
[1:05:49] real me and Jun were talking about it a
[1:05:51] couple days
[1:05:54] ago if you don't study this
[1:05:59] message are you with
[1:06:01] me if you depend on just coming here on
[1:06:04] Sunday and getting your nourishment
[1:06:07] you're
[1:06:08] lost amen you're
[1:06:11] lost and how many of you go back and and
[1:06:14] when you're not here how many go back
[1:06:15] and listen to the sermons brother Dell
[1:06:16] has told you that many
[1:06:17] times no some of you don't cuz you'll
[1:06:20] ask me a question I'll say well I said
[1:06:21] it on tape you didn't hear it oh no I
[1:06:23] didn't hear
[1:06:24] it pray the Lord anyhow you'll catch
[1:06:29] yourself but this is a progressive
[1:06:32] message you got to listen and study now
[1:06:36] everybody believes brother Bron was a
[1:06:37] prophet right everybody right he was a
[1:06:40] prophet all right he's talking to me and
[1:06:42] you then right here in this quote
[1:06:44] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:06:46] will see it won't take just ordinary
[1:06:48] study and thinking to make this book
[1:06:51] real it's going to take the operation of
[1:06:53] the Holy Ghost that means this book can
[1:06:55] be revealed to anyone but a special
[1:06:58] class of people it will take one with
[1:07:01] prophetic Insight that is our anointing
[1:07:04] today is prophetic
[1:07:07] Insight it will require the ability to
[1:07:09] hear from God it will require
[1:07:11] Supernatural instructions he didn't say
[1:07:13] a supernatural
[1:07:16] Pastor he said Supernatural instructions
[1:07:20] you have to hear the five-fold ministry
[1:07:22] but you got to accept it and take it
[1:07:24] into your field just as that was planted
[1:07:27] and you got to plant it deep amen but a
[1:07:29] mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:07:31] spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[1:07:34] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[1:07:36] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:07:38] hear and to know that's the way to get
[1:07:42] it if you can't get it that's the way to
[1:07:44] get it study read your
[1:07:47] Bible if you don't miss the service you
[1:07:49] won't have to listen to it
[1:07:56] no other time could this message ever
[1:07:57] come forth till now Jesus say was in the
[1:08:00] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:08:02] coming of the son of man the message
[1:08:04] could not be until now the world wasn't
[1:08:06] in the condition as until it is now now
[1:08:09] listen folks that was
[1:08:13] 1964 if my Math's correct that's a long
[1:08:20] time 61
[1:08:22] years 61 years this world has revolved
[1:08:28] and we're standing here
[1:08:29] today and we got a president in the
[1:08:31] White House that everybody loves and I
[1:08:33] ain't a politician well I am I'm a mayor
[1:08:35] but anyway U praise the Lord anyhow
[1:08:41] um but like brother Lis
[1:08:44] said even brother Bob said brother Aaron
[1:08:47] we all agree there's nobody they going
[1:08:48] to put in there that's going to turn
[1:08:50] this thing
[1:08:52] around we may for a season do good
[1:08:56] oh everybody's rallying they love you
[1:08:58] know all this new stuff and and I you
[1:09:00] know what if that dude gets me where I
[1:09:02] don't have to pay taxes on my Social
[1:09:03] Security I'll vote for him
[1:09:05] again I cannot believe of course I
[1:09:08] didn't know this I never draw Social
[1:09:10] Security you draw Social Security they
[1:09:12] tax your Social Security you paid 700
[1:09:15] million time taxes on that thing and
[1:09:17] they held your money for 50 something
[1:09:19] years right brother John and they used
[1:09:22] it boy they're good at that yeah right
[1:09:26] then when they give it back to you they
[1:09:27] going to tax it and do something bad
[1:09:29] with the other
[1:09:30] part well Trump said he was going to
[1:09:33] take away that and I'll vote for him
[1:09:35] again if he
[1:09:36] does for y'all young people you don't
[1:09:38] know what that is we'll get a free check
[1:09:40] every month if you keep working long
[1:09:41] enough you will
[1:09:43] too and it ain't very big and you ain't
[1:09:46] going to be able to live on it
[1:09:48] much so no other time could this message
[1:09:51] ever come forth till now the message
[1:09:53] could not be till now the word wasn't in
[1:09:55] the condition as until it is now this is
[1:09:58] the hour that Jesus could appear at any
[1:09:59] time that's been 60 something years ago
[1:10:02] what about
[1:10:04] today what about right now 2025 in
[1:10:07] January getting ready head into February
[1:10:10] what about it have we come to a place
[1:10:12] that we are a prophetic group of people
[1:10:14] that we do hear from God we do get
[1:10:16] instruction from God and listen folks
[1:10:19] you know me I like to I like to have a
[1:10:22] human
[1:10:23] life I hunt I get out and do
[1:10:26] things you don't have to be a messy
[1:10:33] zombie we're going to get into it a
[1:10:35] little bit later on but I'm going to
[1:10:37] tell you
[1:10:38] something Jesus Christ was God Almighty
[1:10:41] and human flesh
[1:10:42] right all right he but he that that
[1:10:45] flesh was
[1:10:47] human he was so much human number one
[1:10:52] brother Joie they didn't believe he's
[1:10:54] God right
[1:10:55] they said you you you hang around with
[1:10:57] Sinners and prostitutes you try that
[1:11:00] today he was a wine bibber and a glutton
[1:11:03] he eat a lot and drank
[1:11:05] wine come on
[1:11:07] somebody they called him the chief of
[1:11:10] devils he was God
[1:11:12] Almighty and they couldn't see that
[1:11:14] human Veil they couldn't see through
[1:11:16] that human Veil that he had to eat he
[1:11:19] probably got
[1:11:20] sick right he moaned and groaned he
[1:11:24] cried right but he was
[1:11:27] God same way with me and you the only
[1:11:30] difference in me and you and him is I
[1:11:32] say Wednesday night brother Brandon
[1:11:35] wasn't God because he was born of
[1:11:37] sex now we're a part of God because of
[1:11:40] the new birth no
[1:11:42] doubt but he was God Almighty the day he
[1:11:45] was
[1:11:45] born everybody with me on that cuz he
[1:11:48] was virgin born the rest of y'all were
[1:11:51] not so that puts us all in one big
[1:11:54] pot you you got to decide whether you
[1:11:55] want to get out of
[1:11:57] it but
[1:11:59] Jesus
[1:12:01] portrayed Jesus Christ portrayed
[1:12:04] God and they hated him for
[1:12:07] it they literally hated him for it sir
[1:12:11] you be a man make yourself God no he was
[1:12:15] God then made himself a
[1:12:17] man same way with today today he's
[1:12:19] living in your flesh isn't he it's the
[1:12:22] same God but not until this day was
[1:12:25] promised that that Ministry would come
[1:12:28] back
[1:12:30] 100% we are living today under the same
[1:12:36] Ministry that the disciples did under
[1:12:39] Jesus yes the difference is they weren't
[1:12:42] born again we
[1:12:44] are that's why more given more
[1:12:48] required listen if they had all been
[1:12:50] born again while he was teaching them
[1:12:52] we'd probably never be here there had
[1:12:53] been a Rapture took place
[1:12:56] but he had to go away and come back and
[1:12:58] then they understood why and guess what
[1:13:02] 11 of those 12 G gave their life John
[1:13:06] the one who died of of natural death at
[1:13:08] 90 something years old but the rest of
[1:13:10] them got sword went through James they
[1:13:12] got pulled apart by animals they got
[1:13:15] stoned they got killed everywhere they
[1:13:19] went
[1:13:20] so if you got to flower a bit of
[1:13:23] ease be careful
[1:13:26] something's
[1:13:27] coming this message is not for weak
[1:13:29] people I'm sorry it's just
[1:13:32] not if a revelation is beyond you now
[1:13:36] watch if Revelation is beyond you look
[1:13:40] up and seek God for
[1:13:43] it that is the only way you're ever
[1:13:46] going to get it a revelation has to come
[1:13:50] from God it never comes by human natural
[1:13:54] and endowments but by spiritual
[1:13:58] enduement enduement means that goes
[1:14:00] inside of you all right remember Jesus
[1:14:02] told him he said you wait to till you be
[1:14:04] endued with power from on high in other
[1:14:06] words just not cover me come inside of
[1:14:10] me so you can make you can even memorize
[1:14:13] the
[1:14:14] scripture we had a brother used to come
[1:14:15] here a long time ago brother Steven he
[1:14:17] was in prison and he's he's good
[1:14:19] Brothers they's still in the message
[1:14:20] somewhere up
[1:14:21] North but um he could sit here and you
[1:14:24] could say
[1:14:26] give me Psalms 54 he' recite the whole
[1:14:29] thing he had memorized the whole thing
[1:14:32] some of you was here long enough you'll
[1:14:34] remember him and he could just I mean he
[1:14:36] never had to stumble it's just like it
[1:14:37] was coming right out of his
[1:14:39] memory but does that do him any good now
[1:14:43] just makes him where
[1:14:44] he don't need a
[1:14:47] Bible you can even memorize the
[1:14:49] scripture and though that is wonderful
[1:14:51] that won't do it it has to be a
[1:14:53] revelation from God it says in the word
[1:14:55] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:14:57] Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have
[1:15:00] to receive the Holy Ghost and then and
[1:15:03] only then can the spirit give you the
[1:15:05] Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God
[1:15:08] the anointed one no man knows the things
[1:15:10] of God save the spirit of God and He To
[1:15:13] Whom the spirit of God reveals them we
[1:15:15] need to call on God for Revelation more
[1:15:17] than anything yes am else in the world
[1:15:21] we've accepted the Bible we have
[1:15:23] accepted the great truths of it but it
[1:15:25] still is not real to most people because
[1:15:28] Revelation by the spirit is not there
[1:15:31] that's why when you talk to
[1:15:32] people it's
[1:15:34] strange I mean we're going to get we're
[1:15:36] going to start talking about Thunders
[1:15:38] and the third pull and squirrels being
[1:15:41] created go tell them
[1:15:43] that they'll look at you crossy and tell
[1:15:45] you crazy what you mean third pole what
[1:15:48] do you mean fishing what do you mean
[1:15:50] lures and and lines and all the things
[1:15:53] brother R told us but you know what I'm
[1:15:55] telling you that's part of my
[1:15:57] being if I hear it on tape if I read it
[1:16:01] I say that ain't nothing but the truth I
[1:16:04] don't doubt he didn't create squirrel I
[1:16:06] don't doubt
[1:16:08] that but you tell other people that the
[1:16:11] guy we follow created
[1:16:16] squirrels but now brother B didn't come
[1:16:18] to change anything he came to restore
[1:16:21] the doctrine of the first church age all
[1:16:24] right that's what he did now we know
[1:16:26] that's the first part that he turned the
[1:16:28] heart heart the soul of the children
[1:16:31] Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah
[1:16:33] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:16:34] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:16:36] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:16:38] to the children now that we know that
[1:16:39] was who John the Baptist and the Heart
[1:16:41] of the children to their fathers us back
[1:16:44] to the faith of the fathers lest I come
[1:16:46] and smite the Earth with a curse now
[1:16:48] remember brother R tells us in the
[1:16:50] church age book that this messenger of
[1:16:52] Malachi forc to do two things
[1:16:54] one do this right
[1:16:57] here but you got to add Revelations 10:7
[1:17:00] to that 10 1-7 where the mighty Angel
[1:17:04] comes down has a book in his hand that's
[1:17:06] open right and thund the thunder
[1:17:10] sound right and in the days of the voice
[1:17:13] of the seventh angel when the these
[1:17:15] things begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:17:16] will be finished brother R said two
[1:17:19] things will happen he's going to restore
[1:17:21] us back to the faith of the fathers
[1:17:22] which we know he did
[1:17:25] and then he's going to bring us
[1:17:26] something that those fathers never knew
[1:17:27] anything
[1:17:33] about even though the Bible we this is
[1:17:36] how God is when brother brandham opened
[1:17:39] those seals God did through him he
[1:17:42] didn't have to find a new Bible amen he
[1:17:45] didn't have to find another book he
[1:17:48] didn't have to everybody with me it was
[1:17:51] already in the Bible it was woven in the
[1:17:54] the Bible in a mystery and that's one
[1:17:57] thing why they couldn't understand Jesus
[1:17:59] how about walking around with somebody
[1:18:00] that talks about birds and fish and
[1:18:02] stones and and Vipers and and steeds and
[1:18:06] ground and he spoke in
[1:18:08] Parables and even his disciples that
[1:18:11] sometime did not understand what he was
[1:18:12] talking
[1:18:14] about but one day when they got the Holy
[1:18:16] Ghost I'll guarantee you they started
[1:18:19] talking among each other saidoh that's
[1:18:21] what he meant yep that's what he meant
[1:18:22] yep that's what he meant
[1:18:26] I pray today that that if you don't have
[1:18:29] the Holy Ghost and you're sitting here
[1:18:30] and you're listening and you're trying
[1:18:32] that God will Quicken what we're saying
[1:18:33] today and Quicken what brother Michael
[1:18:36] was saying today and bring it to your
[1:18:39] heart not an anointing we listen we're
[1:18:42] going to cover all that anointed on at
[1:18:44] the end time later on but we're living
[1:18:45] under that anointing
[1:18:47] too but in dude is
[1:18:50] inside you can be anointed by the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost every day of your life and die and
[1:18:54] go to hell the prophet said we better
[1:18:57] know that we know that we know that you
[1:18:59] got the holy ghost in your soul that
[1:19:01] toost that anchor that token that you
[1:19:04] and I supposed to
[1:19:06] have now listen to what Isaiah said
[1:19:09] here but they also have aired through
[1:19:11] wine and through strong drink and are
[1:19:13] out of the way now watch the priests and
[1:19:16] Prophets didn't say the people priests
[1:19:19] and Prophets have aired through strong
[1:19:21] drink they are swallowed up of wine they
[1:19:24] are out of the way through strong drink
[1:19:26] they Heir in Vision they stumble in
[1:19:31] judgment and I know this is hard to say
[1:19:34] but they call it being
[1:19:38] impaired they were drunk on their own
[1:19:40] self they were drunk on their doctrine
[1:19:43] that was not
[1:19:44] true Satan made them so
[1:19:49] drunk cuz the drunk man what they
[1:19:52] stumble they can't see well actually
[1:19:55] they see things that ain't there that's
[1:19:57] all I've
[1:19:59] heard for all for all tables are full of
[1:20:02] vomit we're just human beings here for
[1:20:05] all tables are full of vomit and
[1:20:07] filthiness so that there's no place
[1:20:08] clean now watch Whom Shall he teach
[1:20:12] knowledge and Whom Shall he make to
[1:20:15] understand
[1:20:17] Doctrine then that are weaned from the
[1:20:20] milk and drawn from the breast in other
[1:20:24] words
[1:20:25] today we go downstairs or you go eat
[1:20:27] somewhere you're not going to order a
[1:20:29] glass of milk and that's all you going
[1:20:30] to have right even though some of us may
[1:20:33] need a
[1:20:36] bottle you're still going to order you
[1:20:38] some steak and some potatoes why because
[1:20:41] that's what your body craves it's all
[1:20:43] right to drink milk it's all right for
[1:20:45] us to go back and and do look at the
[1:20:47] principles of the doctrine of Christ to
[1:20:49] do look and and like I said a couple
[1:20:50] Sundays ago I still get excited about
[1:20:53] acts 238
[1:20:55] amen though I've been in it though
[1:20:57] though i' I have manifested it I still
[1:21:00] get excited when somebody reads acts 238
[1:21:02] amen so it still excites me when they
[1:21:05] when Paul tells us that the God and
[1:21:07] father of our Lord Jesus Christ bless
[1:21:08] you all knowing he wasn't a trinitarian
[1:21:10] and knowing I'm not one
[1:21:12] either we got to know that we
[1:21:17] know as I told y'all
[1:21:20] before March the 30th I'm going to be
[1:21:22] preaching at a Methodist Church oh don't
[1:21:26] worry don't worry everything's all right
[1:21:30] I know where I'm at if you don't know
[1:21:33] where you're at you better stay away you
[1:21:34] may get something on
[1:21:39] you sorry but we come to the place to
[1:21:42] where uh we're so weak that somebody can
[1:21:45] talk us out of what we've been living
[1:21:47] with for or living for for
[1:21:51] years one little something they just oh
[1:21:55] I can't imagine it maybe you can but I
[1:21:57] can't imagine it I'm glad brother Brown
[1:21:59] didn't say blessed I'm not going to the
[1:22:01] Methodist the Baptist and the
[1:22:02] Pentecostal a lot of you wouldn't be
[1:22:03] sitting
[1:22:04] here
[1:22:06] hello so don't worry if you think
[1:22:08] something's going to get on you you
[1:22:09] already got something on you
[1:22:12] anyway cuz I've talked to several other
[1:22:14] message preachers and they said yeah I
[1:22:15] preach for Pentecostal one said I preach
[1:22:17] for Baptist the other one said yeah I
[1:22:18] preach for people why they how they
[1:22:20] going to
[1:22:21] hear your self-righteousness is going to
[1:22:24] go and talk talk to them when you can't
[1:22:25] even talk to them
[1:22:27] yourself for precept must be on on
[1:22:30] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:22:32] line in other words this thing's got to
[1:22:33] be lined up right here a little there a
[1:22:35] little for with stammering lips and
[1:22:37] another tongue will he speak to this
[1:22:38] people as I was saying the other day you
[1:22:41] say well I've never spoken in
[1:22:43] tongues you speak in tongues all the
[1:22:46] time right you speak in a Heavenly
[1:22:48] language that 99% of this world does not
[1:22:52] understand right amen amen
[1:22:55] go and tell them about the what happened
[1:22:56] in the garden you might as well be
[1:22:59] speaking in
[1:23:00] tongue they ain't going to understand
[1:23:02] that and they going to call you foolish
[1:23:05] and they going to say what did you just
[1:23:06] say well you were speaking in another
[1:23:07] language see sometimes we want somebody
[1:23:10] to stand up and and speak in tongues and
[1:23:12] somebody interpret and say well that's
[1:23:13] of God we've got God Among
[1:23:15] Us we got God Among Us anyway we got God
[1:23:19] Among Us by interpretation and by going
[1:23:22] out and talking to people and giving
[1:23:24] them the the word of God the correct
[1:23:26] word of God and then let them make their
[1:23:28] decision yes Amen to him he said this is
[1:23:32] a rest wherein you may cause the weary
[1:23:33] to rest and this is the refreshing yet
[1:23:37] they would not
[1:23:40] hear right Jesus told him one time he
[1:23:44] said you don't he said you're telling me
[1:23:46] I'm this and that and the other and
[1:23:47] other words he said and you don't even
[1:23:48] do what Moses said amen
[1:23:54] but the word of the Lord was upon them
[1:23:56] precepts upon precept precept upon
[1:23:58] precept line upon line line upon line
[1:24:00] here a little and there a
[1:24:02] little I keep forgetting they
[1:24:04] interpreting in there so I'm going pause
[1:24:05] a little bit that they might go now
[1:24:08] watch they've been given the word of God
[1:24:11] line upon
[1:24:12] line this group of people right that
[1:24:16] they might go and fall
[1:24:20] backward and be broken and snared and
[1:24:26] taken remember the Bible tells us that
[1:24:29] he's a stone a stumbling stone that
[1:24:33] they'll stumble over the word of God so
[1:24:36] they're going to stumble over you why
[1:24:37] why do you you know your family love you
[1:24:39] and everything when you was when you was
[1:24:41] smoking drinking cussing and doing all
[1:24:43] those things to the world and you just
[1:24:44] come into the into the family reunion
[1:24:46] and it's like oh yeah press God yeah
[1:24:48] they don't say bless God they say
[1:24:49] something else but now go to that same
[1:24:53] family reunion come
[1:24:56] on that ain't your
[1:24:59] family this is your
[1:25:01] family we know listen you're not going
[1:25:03] to deny your family please don't do that
[1:25:06] do not deny your family don't say I
[1:25:08] ain't going cuz I I'm more spiritual
[1:25:10] than they are I got more than they got
[1:25:11] then you're you're wrong again that's
[1:25:13] right go and be a light they'll decide
[1:25:17] whether they want it or
[1:25:20] not so teaching is that which is taught
[1:25:23] or doctrine so Doctrine is teaching it's
[1:25:26] concerning something it's not just a
[1:25:27] Doctrine you throw out there everybody
[1:25:29] with me so it's an act of teaching or
[1:25:31] instruction and religious Assemblies of
[1:25:34] Christians to speak in the way of
[1:25:35] teaching in distinction from other modes
[1:25:38] of speaking in public to teach one to
[1:25:41] impart instructions instill Doctrine
[1:25:44] into one the thing taught to explain or
[1:25:47] expound on a thing to teach one so what
[1:25:49] is Doctrine Doctrine is teaching and
[1:25:52] brother M said a church without a
[1:25:53] Doctrine is not church so the doctrines
[1:25:56] we have is who we are when we do go to
[1:25:58] work when we do when we do go out to
[1:26:00] make a living when we do go have to walk
[1:26:02] into the world we're not thinking about
[1:26:04] the
[1:26:05] world now come on we do we have to be
[1:26:09] humans but you're not thinking about a
[1:26:11] trinitarian Doctrine you're not thinking
[1:26:13] about I need to go to the Max Factor
[1:26:15] counter and and uh and buy me some
[1:26:17] makeup though some of you may have went
[1:26:19] by there a time or
[1:26:22] two you should know better amen
[1:26:26] right but I told somebody one time he
[1:26:28] said my wife said she gets all this
[1:26:30] stuff from what is in
[1:26:36] um
[1:26:39] PE yeah
[1:26:41] Ulta and and and all that other stuff we
[1:26:44] deliver it like crazy like I mean it's
[1:26:46] like a monthly thing they get and it's
[1:26:48] all
[1:26:50] makeup June don't do that so I spend it
[1:26:52] on hunting
[1:26:57] amen sister told us one time said my
[1:27:00] husband didn't want to go to a certain
[1:27:02] certain place and and and CU he had to
[1:27:04] buy um get a motel room had to pay for a
[1:27:07] motel room she said so the next day I
[1:27:10] went and spent the money that we should
[1:27:11] would have spent on the motel room so
[1:27:15] you have to be careful with you
[1:27:18] sisters but the doctrine you carry
[1:27:20] should be interwoven who you are you
[1:27:22] should not have a everybody understand
[1:27:24] what I'm saying you should not have go
[1:27:25] out there and leave here go out in the
[1:27:27] world and then you start thinking
[1:27:29] different well Trinity may be right
[1:27:32] there's a lot of people believe
[1:27:34] that um all this somebody well that
[1:27:38] brother told me a couple nights ago he
[1:27:39] said there's another brother that was
[1:27:40] used to be in the message this night and
[1:27:42] if I called his name you'd all know him
[1:27:44] well you know he said well Holiness is
[1:27:46] just not that's not part of God anymore
[1:27:49] so his wife she's cut her hair where if
[1:27:51] you leave this message most 9% of the
[1:27:54] people don't go back into a Baptist or
[1:27:57] why would you you you they just go
[1:27:59] complet completely out in the
[1:28:01] world CU there's nothing left
[1:28:04] right can you sit under a Baptist
[1:28:06] teaching after you sit here for 40 and
[1:28:08] 50 years and listen to a Baptist no
[1:28:11] you'd fall asleep like some of you doing
[1:28:13] now but now look at Luke Luke 4 they who
[1:28:18] the people around him were astonished at
[1:28:21] his Doctrine for his word was with power
[1:28:24] right now what did Brother R tell us
[1:28:27] that false Doctrine would cause the
[1:28:29] church to be
[1:28:31] lukewarm formal and
[1:28:35] Powerless so the word coming back in
[1:28:38] power in this end time the word had to
[1:28:40] come back line by line precept by
[1:28:43] precept
[1:28:46] correct then what happened on the day of
[1:28:48] Pentecost and what happened in the first
[1:28:50] three Church ages happened to us brother
[1:28:54] told
[1:28:55] us remember he had three things in his
[1:28:58] ministry we won't have time to cover it
[1:28:59] today but we'll get into a little bit
[1:29:01] later that's the new part of his
[1:29:02] ministry it was the three pulls it was
[1:29:07] he used to take them by the hand his
[1:29:09] hand would turn all bumpy and all kind
[1:29:11] of different colors and he'd tell them
[1:29:14] and then he said the next Ministry would
[1:29:16] be what you discern the very thoughts
[1:29:18] and intents of the heart but what is the
[1:29:21] third one the third one is speaking the
[1:29:23] word word it's the word being made known
[1:29:27] that had never had light shown on it
[1:29:29] before that was the third pull that was
[1:29:32] the Seven Seals that was the seven
[1:29:33] Thunders which we'll get into later on
[1:29:35] so don't get all muddled up about it
[1:29:37] it's just listen everything God
[1:29:40] does to a human being now listen to me
[1:29:43] to a human being he doesn't do in
[1:29:48] sevens he does them in threes right he
[1:29:52] does them in threes not sevens now seven
[1:29:54] is completion three is perfection right
[1:29:58] I want to be perfected then I can become
[1:30:01] complete but I got to get perfected
[1:30:03] first right justification sanctification
[1:30:06] and baptism of Holy Ghost whatever you
[1:30:08] want to look in your journey it's those
[1:30:10] three processes right bring you to the
[1:30:13] New Birth amen and even when you get
[1:30:16] born again you're going to go through
[1:30:17] justification you're going to go through
[1:30:18] sanctification again Paul says I Die
[1:30:21] daily everything I do I've got to
[1:30:24] repent now you didn't do that when you
[1:30:27] were Justified and Sanctified still out
[1:30:30] in the world you stay still out in the
[1:30:32] world Listen folks in this end time
[1:30:34] right here today you can't be justified
[1:30:37] and Sanctified and be
[1:30:40] bride you got to go on to Perfection you
[1:30:43] got to go on to the new
[1:30:45] birth but you got to go through them
[1:30:47] three stages so brother bradam had three
[1:30:50] stages of his ministry
[1:30:55] or as we preached a long time ago there
[1:30:57] was three polls in his journey there's
[1:30:59] three polls in your
[1:31:01] journey and we'll talk about that maybe
[1:31:03] a little bit later but not now Romans 6
[1:31:06] now watch but God be than now this is
[1:31:09] Paul God be than that you were the
[1:31:11] Servants of sin but you have obeyed from
[1:31:13] the heart what your
[1:31:15] soul that form of Doctrine which was
[1:31:18] delivered you being then made free from
[1:31:22] sin you become the Servants of
[1:31:26] righteousness all right Romans 16:1 17
[1:31:30] now I beseech you Brethren mark them
[1:31:32] which cause Division and offenses
[1:31:35] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[1:31:38] heard and avoid
[1:31:41] them we're all supposed to love our
[1:31:43] brother there's no doubt but there's
[1:31:46] going to come a time when you're not
[1:31:47] going to do the separating God's going
[1:31:48] to do the separating and they will do
[1:31:50] the separating for you cuz there are two
[1:31:53] different spirits
[1:31:55] right if they clashed in the garden if
[1:31:56] they clashed in Jesus's time they going
[1:31:58] to clash
[1:32:00] today so Mark those which cause Division
[1:32:02] and offenses and avoid them there's
[1:32:04] another scripture I think I took out of
[1:32:06] here but there's another scripture that
[1:32:08] where brother where uh je Paul was
[1:32:10] telling them don't even let them in your
[1:32:13] house
[1:32:15] whoa you sit on your porch with your
[1:32:17] false Doctrine but you can't come in my
[1:32:18] house that work out well wouldn't it so
[1:32:21] watch Ephesians 4:11 he gave some
[1:32:24] Apostles prophets pastors evangelists
[1:32:27] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:32:29] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:32:30] the edifying the body of Christ till we
[1:32:33] all come to the unity of faith and the
[1:32:34] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:32:37] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:32:39] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:32:41] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:32:44] to and fro and carried about with every
[1:32:46] wind of
[1:32:49] Doctrine by the slight of
[1:32:52] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:32:56] lying weight to
[1:32:58] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[1:33:00] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:33:04] is the head even Christ for whom whole
[1:33:06] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:33:09] compacted that every joint supplies
[1:33:11] according to the effectual working in
[1:33:13] the measure of every part maketh
[1:33:16] increase listen we're a
[1:33:20] body hey somebody from Ohio brought
[1:33:24] 2013 brother Dale preached on um not
[1:33:27] being an organism I not being a
[1:33:28] organization but being an organism
[1:33:31] there's a difference we are an organism
[1:33:34] we're not an
[1:33:35] organization CU organiz or organ
[1:33:38] organization binds you down an organism
[1:33:41] is just people the things
[1:33:44] working pretty good you may may watch
[1:33:47] that one again it's pretty good Clips
[1:33:50] that's one thing those Brothers they
[1:33:51] going to be here
[1:33:53] for the bank for the banquet and I'm
[1:33:56] just going to give them a star while
[1:33:57] they're not here I'll give them one when
[1:33:58] they're here they watch they W they
[1:34:01] watch our sermons all the time and they
[1:34:03] go back to 2012 2010 how many of you
[1:34:06] ever did
[1:34:08] that and they'll pick a sermon title of
[1:34:10] brother Dale and they'll play
[1:34:15] it they have a desire to
[1:34:18] know sometimes this things becomes
[1:34:20] common you know Jesus became common to
[1:34:21] the people sometime even brother Brown
[1:34:23] became common to the people because he
[1:34:26] was brother brandham he did those things
[1:34:29] what about us what do we do what are we
[1:34:31] doing with this message what are we
[1:34:32] doing with
[1:34:34] it huh what are we doing with it you ask
[1:34:36] yourself what are you doing with
[1:34:39] it CU it is eternal yes that's right and
[1:34:44] your Eternal destination depends on
[1:34:47] you learning this
[1:34:50] message therefore I say unto thee
[1:34:52] testify un the Lord that you h Force
[1:34:54] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:34:56] vanity of their minds having the
[1:34:58] understanding darkened being alienated
[1:35:01] from the life of God through what the
[1:35:05] ignorance that is in them because of the
[1:35:08] blindness of their heart because of
[1:35:10] their false teaching because of they
[1:35:12] listen to false Doctrine 1 Timothy
[1:35:16] 1:3 this is it right
[1:35:19] here I beseech you to abide still in
[1:35:22] Ephesus that I went to Macedonia that
[1:35:24] thou mightest charge some that they
[1:35:25] teach no other Doctrine Paul's telling
[1:35:27] them if you hear anything different from
[1:35:29] me he said though an angel come from
[1:35:32] heaven and preach any other gospel
[1:35:34] different from mine let him be a curse
[1:35:37] now that's a man knowing what he knows
[1:35:40] he knows who he
[1:35:42] isall neither give heed to fables and
[1:35:45] endless genealogies which minister
[1:35:47] questions rather than Godly edifying
[1:35:50] which is in faith so
[1:35:52] do take heed to yourself th thyself and
[1:35:56] unto the doctrine continue in them for
[1:35:58] in doing that thou shalt both save
[1:36:00] thyself and them that hear
[1:36:05] you you understand what that means
[1:36:08] brother Michael you can't go and tell
[1:36:10] your fellow co-workers about this
[1:36:12] message and say now we still we still
[1:36:15] believe in a trinity and you can live
[1:36:16] any way you want to but I got this great
[1:36:18] message on see you've killed your
[1:36:20] influence right there you got to have
[1:36:23] that Doctrine andwell inside of you to
[1:36:25] where it's just second
[1:36:28] nature I don't fight at the beer
[1:36:33] counter they got them things now got
[1:36:35] they call them beer
[1:36:37] caves you just walk in no effort at all
[1:36:41] never has bothered me bothered
[1:36:46] you
[1:36:48] why because the doctrine of God has been
[1:36:50] ingrained in us the message of the hour
[1:36:52] has been ingrained in US so much where
[1:36:55] we've heard also we've heard false
[1:36:58] Doctrine in this pull pit not from Dad
[1:37:00] not from any of our ministers but
[1:37:01] somebody come through and I promise you
[1:37:03] before they got out that door they
[1:37:05] wasn't a deacon talking to them and they
[1:37:06] wasn't a pastor talking to them and they
[1:37:08] wern't a preacher talking to them two of
[1:37:10] our sisters went and talked to them
[1:37:11] that's right now you put that in a
[1:37:13] message church and they'll throw you out
[1:37:16] bless God a sister ain't going to tell
[1:37:17] me what to do listen if a sister's got
[1:37:18] the word of God and you don't number one
[1:37:21] be ashamed number number two you better
[1:37:25] listen and that's the truth the brother
[1:37:28] no more got downstairs and the two
[1:37:30] sisters had him cornered over in the
[1:37:31] corner telling him he was
[1:37:35] wrong if any man Teach otherwise and
[1:37:37] consent not to Wholesome words even the
[1:37:41] words of our Lord Jesus into the
[1:37:42] doctrine which is according to Godliness
[1:37:44] now watch let's go down to the very end
[1:37:46] from such withdraw
[1:37:49] yourself this is Paul talking to Timothy
[1:37:52] all script is given by inspiration and
[1:37:54] profitable for Doctrine reprove
[1:37:56] correction instruction and righteousness
[1:37:58] that the man of God may be perfect we
[1:38:01] talking about going from transition from
[1:38:03] partial to perfect or the transition to
[1:38:05] Perfection that the man of God may be
[1:38:07] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:38:10] good
[1:38:11] works for a Time come when they will not
[1:38:14] endure sound Doctrine but after their
[1:38:16] own lust shall they Heap to themselves
[1:38:18] teachers having ishing ears and they'll
[1:38:20] turn away their ears from the truth and
[1:38:22] turned into fables anything contrary to
[1:38:25] the word of God is a
[1:38:28] fable well don't get quiet Titus 1
[1:38:32] ver9 holding fast a faithful word as he
[1:38:35] ha been taught that he may be able by
[1:38:38] sound Doctrine both to exhort and
[1:38:40] convince the gainsayers for there are
[1:38:42] many unruly and vain talkers and
[1:38:44] deceivers especially they of the
[1:38:46] circumcision talking about the Jews who
[1:38:50] so mouth Must Be Stopped who subvert
[1:38:52] whole houses teaching things they ought
[1:38:54] not for filthy luker's
[1:38:57] sake so Doctrine
[1:38:59] is
[1:39:01] Paramount it's it's something you got to
[1:39:03] have you got to know your Doctrine as I
[1:39:06] said last
[1:39:09] Wednesday you ought know have to call
[1:39:12] me to come and explain water baptism to
[1:39:15] somebody that you want to explain to
[1:39:17] right you can't explain it
[1:39:20] yourself I'm sorry right if you can't
[1:39:23] explain water baptism
[1:39:25] yourself I'm sorry I'm being harsh but
[1:39:28] we either get to get in this thing or
[1:39:30] get out of
[1:39:31] it it's like I said Wednesday night are
[1:39:33] we Standing on the Promises or just
[1:39:35] sitting on the premises are we just here
[1:39:37] we just here cuz this is better than
[1:39:39] somebody else's are we just here because
[1:39:42] we feed you or you know like brother
[1:39:44] Dell always said if we can get you in
[1:39:45] with the hot dog somebody else can get
[1:39:46] you out with a
[1:39:47] hamburger I hope we can get you in with
[1:39:49] the word of God and you stay in
[1:39:53] Hebrews 6:1 therefore leaving the
[1:39:55] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:39:57] us go on into Perfection now this is
[1:39:59] Paul not laying again the foundation of
[1:40:02] repentance from dead works or and of
[1:40:04] Faith toward god listen there's a
[1:40:07] foundation that we're we're actually
[1:40:09] sitting and there's a foundation in
[1:40:10] these in the ground right here right now
[1:40:14] we're not going to go down there after
[1:40:15] we get finished with the service and
[1:40:17] start digging around the
[1:40:19] foundation why it's set it's not going
[1:40:23] anywhere it's proved after 5050
[1:40:25] something years it's not
[1:40:27] moving right so why go down there and
[1:40:29] say well I'm wondering if it's go on to
[1:40:32] the
[1:40:33] building go on to the building of the
[1:40:36] building go on to putting together the
[1:40:39] things that we need for our everyday
[1:40:42] life but to change our body to get us
[1:40:44] out of
[1:40:45] here sometimes I think we have too much
[1:40:47] ease in Zion I know we all
[1:40:50] do right right
[1:40:55] God's going to pull all this out from
[1:40:56] under us though you wait and see
[1:40:58] yes I'm telling
[1:41:01] youall stock market's going to go
[1:41:04] crazy job market is going to go crazy
[1:41:07] housing's going to go down gas is going
[1:41:09] to go down we're going to be living a
[1:41:12] wonderful life but the Bible tells us
[1:41:14] that when there's peace peace there'll
[1:41:19] be sudden destruction
[1:41:24] so it may be listen everything in this
[1:41:26] world's temporary
[1:41:28] yes stock market is the biggest has ever
[1:41:31] been but tomorrow it could be a zero and
[1:41:34] all them people that and bless their
[1:41:36] heart I mean they're at the post office
[1:41:38] they've got uh their own uh program and
[1:41:42] you look at it every day and they said
[1:41:43] man I made $22,000 last month I said no
[1:41:46] you really didn't I said uh you might
[1:41:49] want to try to go get it but you can't
[1:41:50] get it for right now you got to leave it
[1:41:52] in there for a while I said but next
[1:41:54] month it may be
[1:41:56] $200 you didn't make that your money
[1:41:59] made that but that's not solid money the
[1:42:01] only thing solid is this message the
[1:42:03] don't thing solid is the Bible the only
[1:42:05] thing solid is the word of
[1:42:07] God so Paul's telling us to not stay on
[1:42:11] the foundation of the doctrine of
[1:42:13] baptism of laying on of hands and
[1:42:14] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[1:42:16] judgment and this will we do if God
[1:42:18] permit and I looked in the strong
[1:42:21] concordance that word leaving now Paul
[1:42:22] said leaving the principles of the
[1:42:24] doctrine of Christ so leaving means to
[1:42:27] in order to go to another place as I
[1:42:29] said last Wednesday this is the
[1:42:32] church okay if we leave this church and
[1:42:35] go over to that
[1:42:37] church you've not done away with this
[1:42:39] church it's still here so the word of
[1:42:43] God is still here Paul's saying you got
[1:42:44] to go from here to
[1:42:48] here in order to go to another place to
[1:42:50] leave so that what is left watch May
[1:42:55] Remain the principles leaving the
[1:42:58] principles the principles is that by
[1:43:00] which anything begins to be the origin
[1:43:02] or the active cause or the how and why
[1:43:06] you got
[1:43:07] here
[1:43:09] okay oh it was great wonderful the day I
[1:43:11] got born
[1:43:14] again but I want to go on God wants you
[1:43:17] to go
[1:43:19] on it's wonderful to to testify
[1:43:24] but you got to go
[1:43:26] on got to go on second John 1 ver9 say
[1:43:30] whoever transgresses and abideth not in
[1:43:31] the doctrine of Christ hath not God he
[1:43:35] that abideth in the doctrine of Christ
[1:43:36] he has both the father and the son that
[1:43:39] does that rattle your
[1:43:40] brain cuz that's what trinitarians use
[1:43:43] they say well you deny the father you
[1:43:44] deny the Son and the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:45] around here somewhere what wait a minute
[1:43:47] they don't call it holy ghost it's the
[1:43:49] Holy Spirit they're scared of a ghost
[1:43:51] amen I'm not scared of Holy
[1:43:53] One give me give me that one give me
[1:43:57] that one give me that
[1:43:59] ghost if there come any unto you and
[1:44:02] bring not this Doctrine watch how
[1:44:04] positive Paul is receive him not this is
[1:44:07] it receive him not into your house
[1:44:10] neither bid him don't even say God bless
[1:44:13] you right I'm reading the Bible I didn't
[1:44:16] make this up this ain't a quote from me
[1:44:19] this is the
[1:44:20] Bible for he that bid with him God speed
[1:44:24] is partaker of his evil
[1:44:28] deed right
[1:44:31] Bible Acts 20: 27 for I have not shun to
[1:44:35] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[1:44:38] take heed therefore unto yourselves to
[1:44:40] all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[1:44:41] has made you overseers to feed the
[1:44:44] Church of God which he has purchased
[1:44:46] with his own blood for I know this that
[1:44:48] after my departing he's getting ready to
[1:44:50] end his life he knows he's fixing to die
[1:44:53] for I know this that after my departing
[1:44:54] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[1:44:57] not sparing the flock and as I said
[1:44:59] Wednesday night Paul is preaching to a
[1:45:01] group of people and then he looks at and
[1:45:03] said some of y'all going to do the same
[1:45:05] thing he didn't exclude them he didn't
[1:45:07] say somebody was going to come in he
[1:45:09] said it would be Grievous wolves enter
[1:45:11] in but he said some of you also of your
[1:45:13] own self shall men arise speaking
[1:45:15] perverse things to draw away
[1:45:18] disciples after them let's read it right
[1:45:20] here and then we'll then we'll be won't
[1:45:23] get into the new ministry but just if
[1:45:25] you if you want to put that in put that
[1:45:27] in put in a new ministry and brother
[1:45:29] random and the reason we're going to
[1:45:30] talk about it is it's because it's it's
[1:45:32] a little
[1:45:34] bit it's hard to understand if you don't
[1:45:36] understand what he's
[1:45:37] saying CU brother brother brandham says
[1:45:40] the first quote he makes is in
[1:45:43] 1958 about this new ministry that God's
[1:45:45] given me okay now he continues on into
[1:45:49] 59 he said this new ministry I'm going
[1:45:52] to try it tonight
[1:45:53] well then he comes to the the next quote
[1:45:55] he says well well how many's been in my
[1:45:57] meetings and hardly ever people anybody
[1:45:59] rais their hand he said well I don't
[1:46:00] think I'll do that tonight I think I'll
[1:46:01] go back to the other to the other way
[1:46:04] you I mean he's sitting there changing
[1:46:05] it back and forth but his new ministry
[1:46:07] was the opening of the word he thought
[1:46:09] the new ministry may be just something
[1:46:10] else because he was talking about taking
[1:46:12] them back in a little room and and
[1:46:14] talking to them personally one to one
[1:46:16] but God is going to he's going to about
[1:46:18] 1963 God's going to turn him around and
[1:46:22] he's going to say this is this is your
[1:46:23] new ministry right here when he went out
[1:46:25] to Arizona and met that cloud he knew
[1:46:28] his ministry was going to change
[1:46:29] then we saw pieces of it and parts of it
[1:46:32] with the creating of the squirrels and
[1:46:33] hady R and all the different things like
[1:46:35] that but you're going to see that his
[1:46:37] progression of Revelation yes I believe
[1:46:39] he progressed in Revelation when God
[1:46:41] told him in 1958 he' to have a new
[1:46:43] ministry he still talks about 1959 he
[1:46:45] still talks about it in 1960 and we'll
[1:46:48] look at that God willing the next time
[1:46:50] we we speak we won't have time to do
[1:46:52] that but I wanted to back up a little
[1:46:53] bit since somewhere here Wednesday
[1:46:55] night now
[1:46:59] watch oh this is the second seal this is
[1:47:01] where I was reading this
[1:47:03] morning now
[1:47:05] remember what is a Doctrine it's what
[1:47:07] you live by Doctrine today your Doctrine
[1:47:11] today is what you live
[1:47:12] by look notice when Satan now everybody
[1:47:15] that realizes that Satan controls all
[1:47:16] political power of the world he said so
[1:47:19] so he controls even you know the man
[1:47:23] that stood up and said God spared my
[1:47:25] life so that I could turn this country
[1:47:31] around everybody's a tool in the hand of
[1:47:34] God good and
[1:47:37] bad he's using Satan
[1:47:40] right he'll use Satan to drive you but
[1:47:42] to
[1:47:43] him oh come on somebody brother Ram said
[1:47:46] that that God will allow a brother to
[1:47:48] say something bad about you to see how
[1:47:51] you'll react
[1:47:53] so don't think that you're don't think
[1:47:55] you're immune to all
[1:47:58] this all the kingdoms belong to him
[1:48:01] that's the reason they fight war and
[1:48:02] kill and remember isn't that strange
[1:48:05] they were given the sword to kill one
[1:48:07] another this is on the second seal he's
[1:48:09] talking about coming to from the first
[1:48:10] seal to Second seal oh my notice now
[1:48:12] look when he did that he did not have
[1:48:15] the ecclesiastical power yet you see
[1:48:18] what's happening
[1:48:21] now you never heard the
[1:48:25] previous
[1:48:27] presidents talk so much about God and
[1:48:29] how God spared his life and how God's
[1:48:31] going to use him and how God this and
[1:48:32] we're going to put God back into this
[1:48:34] and God back into
[1:48:35] that they're going to put God back into
[1:48:38] it all
[1:48:38] right they're
[1:48:41] God cuz they're all part if you're not
[1:48:44] born again today you're part of the God
[1:48:45] of this evil age
[1:48:51] that's but he started Ed with a demon of
[1:48:54] a false
[1:48:56] teaching and that teaching became a
[1:49:00] doctrine that Doctrine became incarnate
[1:49:03] in a false prophet and then he just went
[1:49:06] to the right place he never went to
[1:49:09] Israel he went to
[1:49:11] Rome amen
[1:49:14] wow so what was the first Doctrine Jesus
[1:49:17] preached no what was the first doctrine
[1:49:19] that was outside the Bible it was from
[1:49:22] Rome
[1:49:23] so all the false Doctrine started in
[1:49:26] Rome
[1:49:28] right now remember brother R tells us
[1:49:32] that there was true Born Again Believers
[1:49:35] he said prophets at one time went to NAA
[1:49:38] to try to give their view or their point
[1:49:40] of view and they were just totally
[1:49:42] driven out and actually became part of
[1:49:45] that system that's right notice when
[1:49:49] they got back when these saints of God
[1:49:50] tried to hold up that word Rome came
[1:49:53] right in and accepted dogmas instead now
[1:49:56] let's just see what they did some of
[1:49:57] their false Doctrine what she done we
[1:49:59] know what it was water baptism um Peter
[1:50:02] said repent and be baptized what Rome do
[1:50:04] they turned it around said be baptized
[1:50:06] in name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:50:07] making it a Creed not a doctrine of the
[1:50:09] Bible sprinkling all these different
[1:50:12] things came from the Catholic
[1:50:14] church and look how strong it is
[1:50:17] folks let me tell you this before we
[1:50:19] close I wish that our Doctrine
[1:50:25] on the surface was as strong as
[1:50:29] theirs you think run that around in your
[1:50:31] head for a
[1:50:33] minute they'll die for
[1:50:36] theirs the pope they if the pope came
[1:50:39] out and somebody tried to kill the pope
[1:50:41] there'd be 100,000
[1:50:43] people dive on top of him and and get
[1:50:47] you know probably take the person that
[1:50:49] tried to kill him and kill him
[1:50:53] I don't think that'll happen
[1:50:57] here but we believe the message of the
[1:50:59] hour or do we believe
[1:51:03] that we believe in one God not a
[1:51:06] trinity We Believe water baptism in the
[1:51:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:51:12] didn't they don't listen folks 99% of
[1:51:14] the world that's what I'm saying they
[1:51:16] are so passionate about their Doctrine
[1:51:19] why can't we be that
[1:51:21] way we ain't got to look to a pope we
[1:51:25] look to Jesus Christ but then God give
[1:51:28] us a five-fold Ministry from God to tell
[1:51:32] us all these great Mysteries and to
[1:51:36] break it down to the people and what do
[1:51:39] we do we come when we want to when we
[1:51:41] feel like it we come to church we don't
[1:51:43] and I'm not going to listen to him again
[1:51:46] me and brother Bob was talking the other
[1:51:47] day and I do I hate to hear my voice
[1:51:49] I'll listen to myself sometime to see
[1:51:51] certain things but I hate to hear my
[1:51:53] voice and Bob said I hate to hear mine
[1:51:55] too so we listen to all the other ones I
[1:51:57] listen to him and he listens to me I
[1:51:58] don't listen to them I listen to
[1:52:01] myself and they all believe in eternal
[1:52:04] hell all denominations
[1:52:07] do even the Roman Catholics have
[1:52:10] inserted Purgatory they inserted
[1:52:11] something ain't even in the
[1:52:13] Bible and we know holding his conduct
[1:52:16] and dress I drove by a church a few
[1:52:17] minutes ago and sister was walking
[1:52:20] in she needed a dress on
[1:52:23] she had old jeans and that I think that
[1:52:25] was painted on her but going into church
[1:52:28] to worship
[1:52:30] yes hair cut off you say well we we yeah
[1:52:35] we need to be away from Holiness we need
[1:52:37] to not have to preach
[1:52:39] this it's in the Bible brother R didn't
[1:52:42] change the Bible he just absolutely
[1:52:44] Shone light on the Bible that we've been
[1:52:47] reading for 2,000
[1:52:50] years it never changed
[1:52:53] but now I'm telling you though when you
[1:52:54] read it Through The Eyes of the Holy
[1:52:56] Ghost didn't it sound
[1:52:59] different didn't it sound
[1:53:04] different so holiness conduct and dress
[1:53:06] Church
[1:53:07] order Lord they don't have no church
[1:53:09] order now folks I promise
[1:53:11] you
[1:53:13] none brother ran said he said they have
[1:53:17] now become lodges and that's exactly
[1:53:19] what they are I'm sorry there's some
[1:53:21] good people out there but you walk in a
[1:53:23] Baptist church today or even a Methodist
[1:53:24] church today and it's just like it's
[1:53:26] just like um like you're in a restaurant
[1:53:29] people drink a coffee people eating
[1:53:32] biscuit or something in the sanctuary
[1:53:34] and I seen it myself or I wouldn't be
[1:53:36] saying this right talk about the ball
[1:53:39] game talk about everything else then
[1:53:40] about about time kind of like some of
[1:53:42] y'all do about time church starts you
[1:53:44] migrate in hello somebody we got it
[1:53:48] we're not going to get away from church
[1:53:49] order on brother Brown told us
[1:53:52] be here 20 minutes before the service
[1:53:54] starts not 20 minutes before the
[1:53:56] preaching starts service starts at
[1:53:58] 10:00 now what's the problem what's your
[1:54:03] problem don't get quiet it's Church
[1:54:05] order it should be indwelled and
[1:54:07] ingrained in you to be here early cuz if
[1:54:10] not you bring every demon in the world
[1:54:12] I'm telling you I would be too I have to
[1:54:15] pray back there I have to pray in here
[1:54:17] to get them things off of me well if you
[1:54:19] don't have them pray for
[1:54:21] me amen
[1:54:24] now try to explain serpent seed to
[1:54:25] somebody and they will throw you they'll
[1:54:27] put you in jail for
[1:54:31] that nobody ever preached a body
[1:54:34] change between Sarah and
[1:54:38] Abraham but it's always been in the
[1:54:40] Bible when you put the Love Letter
[1:54:43] together you see that she took a 300
[1:54:46] mile Journey you see that a a king that
[1:54:49] that could have any pretty woman in the
[1:54:51] whole land picked the brother Brown said
[1:54:53] picked old grandma 100 year old grandma
[1:54:56] well she wasn't 100 years old anymore
[1:54:58] she was
[1:54:59] beautiful the king wanted her and he was
[1:55:01] taking her if God hadn't done what he
[1:55:03] did remember he gave him a
[1:55:06] dream every denomination believes
[1:55:09] there's tribulation for their
[1:55:12] bride
[1:55:14] right and they all have to go to the
[1:55:16] white Throne
[1:55:17] judgment we don't we don't go through
[1:55:21] tribulation
[1:55:24] nobody understood about the church ages
[1:55:26] or The Messengers until brother V come
[1:55:28] along is that you a perfect man it's
[1:55:30] always been in second Peter but we
[1:55:32] didn't know how to articulate it to get
[1:55:34] it to us that we're supposed to
[1:55:37] grow and come to
[1:55:40] adoption and then the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:55:42] how he put that together we'll look at
[1:55:43] all these great things but I want to get
[1:55:45] one thing real quick right
[1:55:47] here since Jesus
[1:55:50] said I indict this generation or or
[1:55:53] brother R said I indict this generation
[1:55:55] when Jesus told him in there in Matthew
[1:55:58] said the son of man will be risen again
[1:56:00] now if a son of man has to raise he must
[1:56:02] have got killed
[1:56:05] somewhere right remember the second time
[1:56:07] wasn't physical the second time was
[1:56:09] spiritual
[1:56:10] amen listen God cannot work in false
[1:56:14] Doctrine sure he'll work in the
[1:56:15] ignorance of the time that you're in
[1:56:17] listen to me he worked in Luther and
[1:56:20] Wesley it wasn't time for full
[1:56:23] Perfection now is the time for precept
[1:56:27] line it all be straightened out all
[1:56:30] should know how to live this not this
[1:56:33] message live the
[1:56:38] Bible my indictment is against the
[1:56:40] churches of today I'm not bringing the
[1:56:42] center into this I'm just speaking this
[1:56:44] to the
[1:56:45] church and it's on tape I try to get
[1:56:48] through it quick now to do this in this
[1:56:50] age we live in I do this I must show in
[1:56:52] evidence now remember when you bring an
[1:56:54] indictment you got you bring somebody in
[1:56:55] you indict them because they've done
[1:56:58] something right or allegedly done
[1:57:02] something then you got to bring the
[1:57:04] evidence right then you got to bring a
[1:57:07] conviction
[1:57:09] right then you got to have somebody
[1:57:11] carry out that
[1:57:12] conviction there's a sentencing phase
[1:57:14] after all
[1:57:17] right so now brother brandham he brought
[1:57:19] an indictment told him why they killed
[1:57:21] Jesus Christ told them they had turned
[1:57:23] the blood down and we showed that we are
[1:57:25] the blood by the spirit of God you and I
[1:57:28] are that bumper
[1:57:33] blood you said no that's Jesus brother
[1:57:36] Brown said we're the blood by the
[1:57:38] spirit we are what's keeping this world
[1:57:40] from going totally
[1:57:42] insane I told Brother Dutch and sister
[1:57:45] April we just came from our house
[1:57:47] through Gainesville which ain't very big
[1:57:50] well it is now and then to get all the
[1:57:52] way to Jasper it was Bumper to Bumper
[1:57:55] you noticed all that we got so much
[1:57:57] traffic we're going to head out here in
[1:57:59] just a little while I'll guarantee you
[1:58:01] when we get to Chattanooga there'll be
[1:58:04] four lanes in both directions and
[1:58:05] they'll be running 5 miles an hour just
[1:58:08] because you wait till this thing falls
[1:58:11] apart
[1:58:12] folks you think it's bad
[1:58:14] now we better make preparation to get
[1:58:17] out of
[1:58:19] it not have to be caught in it could you
[1:58:22] imagine be caught in a traffic jam that
[1:58:24] were miles and miles and you and you
[1:58:26] know that you needed food for your kids
[1:58:28] and you needed
[1:58:30] gas amen I don't like I'm not a doomsday
[1:58:33] preacher but these things will
[1:58:35] happen they're going to happen amen and
[1:58:38] I say they'll help happen in our
[1:58:41] lifetime because we see the part of it
[1:58:43] now that that there's there's no Road
[1:58:45] for nobody is every everything's all
[1:58:47] jammed up and they're wanting to get
[1:58:49] somewhere real fast
[1:58:52] so he brings an indictment he brings the
[1:58:54] evidence he brings a conviction he
[1:58:56] convicted them for crucifying Christ he
[1:59:00] could not have been done a few years ago
[1:59:02] 50 years ago and then he said 10 years
[1:59:04] ago but it's
[1:59:06] today because he come on the scene as
[1:59:09] the prophet in the end time he can
[1:59:12] indict that whole
[1:59:14] generation tell them
[1:59:18] why and then convict
[1:59:20] them but I said before it takes a
[1:59:24] carrying out of the sentence well who's
[1:59:27] going to carry that that sentence out
[1:59:29] brother R's gone he's not here
[1:59:33] anymore you and
[1:59:35] I are going to carry that sentence out
[1:59:39] you and I when we come to Perfection and
[1:59:41] we prove to the world that God's in us
[1:59:46] and not out there amen you and I will be
[1:59:49] carrying out the sentence
[1:59:52] you know how I can type
[1:59:54] that Elijah number one stood and said
[1:59:58] Jezebel the dogs will eat your
[2:00:00] blood right that's what he said right he
[2:00:04] went off the scene Elijah number two
[2:00:07] Elisha number or Elijah Elisha come on
[2:00:10] the scene and brother R said who did
[2:00:11] that
[2:00:12] TI the
[2:00:14] bride the bride carried out and saw the
[2:00:17] sentence being carried out because
[2:00:19] Elisha was the one standing there when
[2:00:21] jus throw her out the window and the
[2:00:23] dogs eat her blood so guess or eat her
[2:00:25] body so you and I are here to carry out
[2:00:27] that sentence if it would have just been
[2:00:29] brother RAM and he left and there's no
[2:00:30] power come on folks if there's no power
[2:00:33] left in the church then we're defeated
[2:00:36] that's right there was a there was a a
[2:00:38] crucifixion but there was no
[2:00:40] Resurrection you and I are the
[2:00:42] resurrection of that word of God you and
[2:00:45] I are the people that's going to see
[2:00:47] this carried out you're going to see the
[2:00:50] dead raised you're going to see the
[2:00:52] stones get rolled away oh Hallelujah I
[2:00:54] just believe it's
[2:00:58] us we're not going to go to the grave
[2:01:01] site with a tape
[2:01:07] player or a
[2:01:12] book it's going to be human beings that
[2:01:15] have come to a place that God can trust
[2:01:18] us to
[2:01:19] say let the resurrection happen
[2:01:23] let it be
[2:01:26] now it's going to be the voice of the
[2:01:30] bride and the
[2:01:33] bridegroom it'll be the voice of the
[2:01:34] Bride through the bridegroom that's
[2:01:36] going to raise the dead it's not going
[2:01:38] to be a tape player not going to be how
[2:01:40] many pictures we like pictures and we
[2:01:42] like pens that's okay that just
[2:01:45] identifies what we
[2:01:46] believe but this is not going to you
[2:01:49] know you know it's not going to save
[2:01:50] anybody
[2:01:52] if you wear that to a restaurant
[2:01:53] nobody's ever asked me what that
[2:01:56] is you know if you got other little pens
[2:01:58] on they say what's that what's that for
[2:02:00] they don't ask about that I tell them
[2:02:02] and then they you know what they do yeah
[2:02:05] okay
[2:02:07] right what do you mean the Prophet come
[2:02:09] what do you mean he went out in Arizona
[2:02:11] what do you mean that that this great
[2:02:12] big cloud came up came uh up in the sky
[2:02:15] and and uh brother Brown says seven
[2:02:19] angels man says it was
[2:02:24] Rockets man's always deluded the word of
[2:02:27] God what have we
[2:02:30] done now listen just one come on
[2:02:33] musicians
[2:02:35] 1956 this is the first time and then
[2:02:37] we'll we'll cover it from right here I
[2:02:39] want to background since we were
[2:02:41] preaching Wednesday on this um just in
[2:02:43] case you didn't watch it
[2:02:45] again in 1956 now this is
[2:02:49] 1956 and watch what brother R said in
[2:02:51] then we'll then we'll be finished
[2:02:53] brother randam why do you have such
[2:02:55] Faith Standing There Ain't You Afraid
[2:02:57] there'd be a mistake no sir
[2:03:01] 1956 aren't you afraid you'll say
[2:03:03] something wrong no sir God said so that
[2:03:07] settled it amen that's just all there is
[2:03:09] to it are you afraid now you making this
[2:03:12] concerning this new ministry that you're
[2:03:14] entering do you think that's going to be
[2:03:16] you say greater yes how do you know God
[2:03:19] said so oh I haven't got one bit of
[2:03:22] doubt my heart's just leaping and
[2:03:23] jumping to it see because God said so
[2:03:26] that settled it that's just all there is
[2:03:28] to it it's going to be that way God said
[2:03:30] so and that settles it he talks about it
[2:03:33] in 1958 now we went from 56 to 58 we'll
[2:03:35] go real quick preach in 1958 1960 he's
[2:03:40] talking about his new
[2:03:42] ministry but look he said it's not the
[2:03:45] discernment
[2:03:54] his new ministry wasn't
[2:03:55] discernment because in 1960 right
[2:03:58] brother a 1960 he'd been Discerning the
[2:04:00] thoughts and intents of the heart for
[2:04:02] years but see I think he thought it was
[2:04:05] going to be greater in the prayer line
[2:04:06] but it wasn't greater than that it was
[2:04:08] greater in the word of
[2:04:10] God now it's not in discernment
[2:04:12] discernment I find them things out but
[2:04:15] this is not discernment I'm searching
[2:04:17] for a new ministry all of you understand
[2:04:20] and they did not amen
[2:04:24] 1960 brother Brown said this is the time
[2:04:26] that there's a new ministry coming ahead
[2:04:28] of
[2:04:29] me I better go back then he said no
[2:04:32] there's not many people here that know
[2:04:33] me I better go back to the old ministry
[2:04:34] tonight and then have the new ministry
[2:04:36] start tomorrow evening it never started
[2:04:39] the new ministry is the curse the
[2:04:40] disease that's in
[2:04:45] there there'll be another sign which you
[2:04:47] were born with you'll see visions and
[2:04:49] know that people has done and all about
[2:04:50] them and so forth
[2:04:52] that wasn't it remember it's not the
[2:04:55] discernment not
[2:04:58] discernment tell you this the Lord told
[2:05:00] me there'd be another Ministry you
[2:05:01] remember that that been four years ago
[2:05:04] which would be the Discerning of the
[2:05:05] thoughts of the heart and so forth well
[2:05:07] them Ministries had worked perfectly the
[2:05:08] world around one went its day the other
[2:05:12] lived its
[2:05:15] day he's bringing in the new ministry
[2:05:18] I'll speak the
[2:05:20] word first was
[2:05:24] what sign of the hand second pull was
[2:05:28] discernment I'll read it to you oh I
[2:05:31] think it's annoying ones at the any time
[2:05:32] the second
[2:05:33] pull was a discernment what's the third
[2:05:36] pull the opening of the
[2:05:38] word the Mysteries revealed and that's
[2:05:41] what we're coming to Let's stand to our
[2:05:43] feet let's don't get behind amen let's
[2:05:46] don't get behind let's sharpen our
[2:05:48] pencil and let's not get behind
[2:05:52] see brother Brown says the second
[2:05:53] Ministry is leaving and the third is
[2:05:55] entering
[2:05:58] in how about that so he knew what was
[2:06:01] going
[2:06:03] on he just didn't know exactly which way
[2:06:06] it was coming from but it was coming
[2:06:08] from the opening of The Seven
[2:06:11] Seals where man had never ever seen
[2:06:15] before you love the
[2:06:18] Lord let's study this word more than
[2:06:20] we've ever studied before
[2:06:22] let's see what God will do for us you
[2:06:25] say I don't see God doing anything well
[2:06:26] maybe it's your
[2:06:28] fault start with your house first I'll
[2:06:30] start with my house first you start with
[2:06:32] your house
[2:06:35] first brother Bown tells
[2:06:37] us he said you get a church in the right
[2:06:40] frame of mind he said God can do
[2:06:42] anything he wants to do through
[2:06:45] us let's do that let's get
[2:06:48] God on our
[2:06:50] Forefront from this day forward it's a

[2:07:02] just have it later on but um but we pray
[2:07:05] that that God will do something in your
[2:07:09] life just like brother rown said God
