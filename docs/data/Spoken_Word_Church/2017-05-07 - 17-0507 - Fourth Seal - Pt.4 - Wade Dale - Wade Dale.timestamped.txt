[0:00] Gabby you alright here we go
[0:12] now everybody here with us today being
[0:15] outdoors with Revelation chapter state
[0:20] now what we're doing if we're talking on
[0:21] the for sale and we were talking about
[0:24] last Sunday the rapture come on the
[0:29] fourth seal all right
[0:33] but that five six and seven can't do
[0:35] away with so what do please leave a
[0:37] comment doing hanging five six and seven
[0:38] and put them back under the fourth
[0:41] okay not to lift you can't you got to
[0:47] remember you got our understanding this
[0:49] in a supernatural way or in a way that
[0:54] five six and seven natural will will not
[0:57] have them all four five and six will
[0:59] never happen one over here cuz it is the
[1:02] Israel getting saved literally it's the
[1:05] it's and you can say that you gettin
[1:07] killed in two prophets Consing we will
[1:10] not be here during that time okay but
[1:12] the chronolock saw programs that you can
[1:14] compare the seal with the church ages
[1:16] but you can't compare me but you can't
[1:20] exactly put seal one with Church agent
[1:22] one still vision okay but you can
[1:25] because remember with the first seal
[1:26] covers three churches right okay the
[1:31] second seal covers what one church age
[1:34] all right okay third seal we just got me
[1:39] from the third seal the man covers to
[1:41] charge ages basically going on that all
[1:44] right then you got what the one we're
[1:46] talking about the rapture happens on the
[1:48] fourth seal seven church age so don't
[1:52] worry about your numbers okay don't
[1:55] worry about your numbers going one two
[1:57] three four because I'm sure that a lot
[2:00] of people do not understand is when
[2:03] building ramps there's a rapture takes
[2:04] place on the fourth seal yeah yet the
[2:06] seven seals
[2:06] Lord see everybody just go well now he
[2:09] painted we got in God anything is
[2:12] possible everything is possible there is
[2:15] a natural meaning listen we have to
[2:18] bribe know there's and there's a natural
[2:20] happening to the world there's a
[2:22] spiritual happening to the world there's
[2:27] a natural happening to the bride there's
[2:29] a spiritual happening to a bride there's
[2:31] a natural happening to Israel there's a
[2:33] spiritual have a vehicle so man you you
[2:36] know and you get old clutch you get a
[2:40] cluster up and you think well now I
[2:42] can't understand this number one we know
[2:46] about the natural that ought to be easy
[2:48] we're living in the seventh circuit okay
[2:54] supernaturally we're not in the cemetery
[2:57] okay
[2:58] we're already called a mini eight-day
[3:01] we're already a sucker it's the saying
[3:03] the other day you know you you get your
[3:05] preaching that so much oh well
[3:07] somebody's going to catch it going
[3:08] brother bro away just like brother Paul
[3:10] he said to the rap she's going to do a
[3:12] place in the resurrection it doesn't
[3:14] happen and all it's done to play no but
[3:18] tell me one thing what it is a rapture
[3:21] the rapture happening on the fourth seal
[3:25] has got to be a supernatural happening
[3:28] simply because the one thing is it's
[3:31] prop what is promised to happen but
[3:36] timewise it's promised to happen in the
[3:39] 7:30 you got that girl cuz the raptures
[3:44] not is not a natural happening so
[3:46] supernatural happen okay did something
[3:50] that's not natural
[3:51] alright alright so the wrath which is
[3:54] going to take place on the fourth seal
[3:57] because the combat these are gone in
[4:00] other words the Holy Ghost has lifted
[4:01] off the earth prophet signal time he
[4:04] said the Holy Ghost will live off the
[4:05] earth and then what return to the Jews
[4:09] right and how how amazing because it
[4:14] will try might last night
[4:17] and brother julep region on Wednesday
[4:22] night the reason that other things are
[4:24] not happening this earth that that that
[4:26] more of the happenings in the Bible is
[4:30] not happening on the earth over here
[4:32] right so we're here the Holy Ghost is
[4:35] still on the earth in the for combat
[4:37] beef what getting and getting a bride
[4:41] ready this is not for the world right
[4:45] they don't care ok because when when
[4:49] when the rapture takes place is going to
[4:53] take the Holy Ghost off the earth and
[4:55] the only thing that's going to come back
[4:57] to is one hundred and forty six thousand
[5:01] people not three 144 into darkness 144
[5:12] into no the Holy Ghost is going to kill
[5:16] 900 of the two prophets wrong they're
[5:18] going to breach and listen at that
[5:22] moment they're the only few people with
[5:25] the Holy Ghost on the whole phase they
[5:27] are afraid how awesome they look but
[5:32] they have but look at their control God
[5:35] has his funneled everything down to two
[5:37] men now the 144,000 going to receive the
[5:41] Holy Ghost sure but when they leave
[5:44] that's why the Battle of Armageddon is
[5:46] going to happen
[5:48] there is no flesh saved savable at that
[5:53] time right you heard what I said
[5:56] I said no flesh saleable I didn't say
[5:59] that the Phyllis virgin won't get
[6:01] eternal life later or some am given
[6:03] water my name will give eternal life
[6:05] later but they're going to come up in
[6:07] that white throne judgment in a dead
[6:10] flesh or flesh that's that's dying okay
[6:14] then I got that point so what happening
[6:17] that this for seal is that all this is
[6:20] going to be lifted up off the earth and
[6:23] there's nobody
[6:27] what a horrible thing there's nobody
[6:30] going to have the hold up that's why the
[6:33] place can fall programs different time
[6:36] you know you just get you just get a
[6:37] minor piece of it now let's go out and
[6:41] holding up a trap because why the older
[6:43] background because you're walking around
[6:44] here because there's Brian in
[6:48] Afghanistan alright I understand all
[6:51] these places for this you know with the
[6:54] troubles are really big even in true
[6:56] there's a bride that touching nothing on
[7:00] it
[7:01] do my prophets no harm but what about
[7:03] when they're all gone then the wrath of
[7:07] God brother Esther is going to be poured
[7:09] out what on the Gentiles then come to
[7:15] the Jews while 144,000 is getting their
[7:19] Redemption are their message of
[7:23] redemption see their message your
[7:26] redemption is like it's like you know
[7:28] the day of atonement the day of
[7:30] atonement is not killing the dammit oma
[7:34] if you don't kill up an animal it's
[7:36] morning for the kill that's already been
[7:38] so what happened is they're going to
[7:40] come enough crucified Christ again
[7:42] they're going to realize he was already
[7:44] killed they're gonna realize that they
[7:47] did it right they going to realize that
[7:52] they the Jews Jewish Israel because
[7:57] Jesus cause of death but remember what
[7:58] the Bible says where you get those
[8:00] charts in the house of my friends don't
[8:01] worry it was done to preserve life in
[8:06] other words to the 144,000 the two
[8:10] prophets are going to easily turn and
[8:13] say those people that come to a
[8:17] rapturing condition rattling revelation
[8:21] the jinjo God has taken them out of the
[8:24] way now is your time
[8:26] right now you're not and they're gonna
[8:29] be so focused on that three and a half
[8:32] years of look what it's cooked on how
[8:34] long it took us so many even 50 or 60
[8:37] years just to go up statute perfect man
[8:40] and look at them they don't have to all
[8:42] go up to a perfect man they don't have
[8:44] to be manifested sons died but but wow
[8:47] these P products are I believe because
[8:50] they're they're controlling nature there
[8:53] they're going to absolutely do what I
[8:58] could have done and then I've been a
[9:01] fault but they're going to bring down
[9:03] plagues because why because of the
[9:05] rejection man has rejected this whole
[9:09] thing I I was looking up this morning
[9:12] and no disrespect to anyone but the
[9:15] paper had a they always have a little
[9:18] snippet from a preacher in the area you
[9:20] know come in and in say little comment
[9:23] or something you know and this woman it
[9:26] was the woman to Methodist Church and I
[9:29] thought man Methodist Church John Wesley
[9:32] would absolutely pay them people apart
[9:37] no one knew the woman treatment she's
[9:39] got down at the very end she said we
[9:40] pray to the Father and to the Son and to
[9:42] the Holy Ghost to bring these blessings
[9:45] upon you but you see it but see that's
[9:52] why I was saying the other day you gotta
[9:54] look at this thing in in two two spots
[9:59] and once you really get this though it's
[10:02] going to help listen it's going to help
[10:04] you from now till we go in after that
[10:06] there was two parts of brother grounds
[10:08] message
[10:09] [Applause]
[10:12] the first one was what restore us back
[10:16] to right here this is the pyramid right
[10:19] okay this is so this is his first part
[10:22] restore the hearts of the children back
[10:25] children back to the fathers children
[10:27] babbling Pentecostal baby back to the
[10:29] faith of the father that was once
[10:31] delivered to the Saints in this birth
[10:33] birthday front right the second part of
[10:37] his message was what absolutely the
[10:40] headstone himself okay remember it was
[10:44] rejected it became the chief Cornerstone
[10:46] and grew back up
[10:47] how did it only grows up we're coming
[10:49] out last night
[10:50] it only grows through profits but a 500
[10:55] ministry catches what that Prophet says
[10:58] and brings it to the people then in the
[11:01] days of the boys sure the property God
[11:03] brought this but you can't do away with
[11:07] it that some Steve my brother upset
[11:10] about taking a leap of the one that's an
[11:12] delete from the Trinity put it together
[11:14] and it grew a big tree a nice big tree
[11:16] you can't do like some dead will from 47
[11:20] to 63 was was Paul he had yet fallacies
[11:24] and he and he me and he and he and he
[11:27] just keep going on
[11:29] you heard it so we did away in 47 63 and
[11:32] then we take 63 to 65 they have portrait
[11:38] that part truth brother Brown did have
[11:41] some fallacies in here he talked about
[11:43] Moore's Rider was the holy note he
[11:46] talked at love with the evidence of the
[11:49] holy note there sure but what happened
[11:51] was what was God doing God was honing a
[11:54] man one man he was only one man well
[11:59] what he had to go back dad you've heard
[12:00] of man's hippo he was holding he was
[12:05] only the Prophet to wear what this would
[12:08] sit on top of this yes joy 1963 when the
[12:15] Lord made him out there in Arizona
[12:17] brought him a revelation of what we're
[12:19] talking about of the seals that
[12:22] his new manager he always said he was
[12:24] looking for any man for something new
[12:25] something whatever he just didn't really
[12:28] know but from 63 to 65 but you can't say
[12:34] well we're just gonna you know we're
[12:35] going to major on this and minor on that
[12:37] it's all these people get these pretty
[12:39] strong counter sermon you know about me
[12:41] you can't understand him from 63 to 65
[12:44] till just a with a simple 47 to 53 well
[12:47] let me tell you talk about 47 to 63
[12:49] that's not so example back to faith of
[12:51] the Father I want them to come back and
[12:53] do what happened in the book last do
[12:56] what happened in the book of Acts and
[12:57] we'll say that we took 47 63 and we have
[13:00] become that and now let's move on but
[13:03] they're still down here what with the
[13:05] children they're down here with the
[13:06] babies drink the milk all right so you
[13:10] got to have the whole picture the whole
[13:13] picture so from 63 to 65 it was the same
[13:17] grand I had your message that Jesus
[13:20] Christ preached while he was on the
[13:22] earth no no right amen
[13:25] could he take 63 65 63 64 65 because he
[13:29] died of delayed 65 so that's three years
[13:31] but if you go back six months when you
[13:33] started preaching on a person one thing
[13:36] another but spoke more in C bring all
[13:38] that in and need priests because
[13:42] remember there's a lap over brother
[13:44] Brown's Menifee there's a lap over and
[13:46] everything God the only thing about God
[13:49] is is one day he's going to work on a
[13:50] have a a rapture anymore not going to
[13:54] have an overlap or three or days later
[13:55] no we're going out after and we all want
[13:58] to go another round tip we'll be getting
[14:00] together then we all want to leave but
[14:02] now in Gaza everything he does is he
[14:04] gives grape he gives a lap over there
[14:06] was a lap over brother gravel ministry
[14:08] going from 60 about 61 62 you see he
[14:12] preaches - anyway preachers own book
[14:15] more driven c4 this with preachers
[14:21] anyway I think about say my good morning
[14:24] let's create so today but that was a it
[14:27] was a walk it was something building up
[14:29] to not you're dumping the seals because
[14:32] honestly they didn't get it he told me
[14:34] get it after the seals were broke they
[14:38] did anyway and God was still but what
[14:41] you're doing though he's bringing it to
[14:42] me and you where it's Frank is bringing
[14:45] us up bring us up bringing us up
[14:47] bringing us up to schedule perfect man
[14:49] to where we can get this headstone
[14:51] message now truly and honestly that has
[14:54] stone message now that is only for a
[14:59] small group of people that's going to
[15:01] really understand that okay and that's
[15:03] all right that's no big deal it's really
[15:05] not
[15:07] dottie turned around last night and said
[15:09] we come about being in the temple you
[15:12] know then and he said why just wanna be
[15:14] a share that's a lie like David I said
[15:16] just put me at the door let me I'm too
[15:18] big let me be a doormat in the house of
[15:20] God just let me be somewhere inside the
[15:23] you know inside of the door but but we
[15:29] can't have that all because there's got
[15:30] to be someone like we're coming let's
[15:32] not there's got to be someone that
[15:33] brings describe your profession so it's
[15:35] got to be through a fivefold ministry
[15:37] trying their best to get you to see who
[15:40] you are not belittle you're not saying
[15:43] you don't know nothing I don't like that
[15:46] because you know you you do if you're
[15:49] born again you're a child of God period
[15:53] if you're born again and as we've said
[15:57] for Nate mom roll out last night now
[15:59] what about people with the Holy Ghost
[16:00] different listen you can refuse further
[16:03] minh of the word and be born again
[16:06] that's a paradox to me but some people
[16:10] can only go so far and that's it and God
[16:14] said I am well pleased to go in that
[16:16] person but I've got these other people
[16:19] that want to go on now he's not going to
[16:21] keep that child out remember the bar
[16:23] well done when he went out he was a
[16:25] child when he come back he was a child
[16:28] with some more authority he was put back
[16:30] in position
[16:31] okay same way with you and I same way
[16:35] with a prize Jesus Christ is going to be
[16:37] some that's going listen we're all
[16:40] belong just barely maybe there's not
[16:43] going to be so nice standing at the end
[16:44] time because brother Graham said your
[16:46] pleasures gonna be sticky right up to
[16:48] the day you're changing today right all
[16:53] right so the day we're changed when
[16:55] we're changed we can finally say it's
[16:57] over okay is there done it's finished
[17:00] but until then listen we'll talk about a
[17:06] little bit after noon about what the
[17:07] flesh did we'll program talk about the
[17:09] flesh because the metal Genesis 1:26 man
[17:12] never fell but when he put that 1:26 man
[17:16] into the 2:7 man the two-seven man fell
[17:19] by his nature by the natural things that
[17:23] he did and by his body reacting to the
[17:26] things we'll talk about that let's go
[17:28] but so the word never fails
[17:32] yes see the word eternal man they're
[17:36] just adding stuff to it okay I always
[17:39] ought to make it we all you know we all
[17:40] got to be in this yeah well I understand
[17:44] about that blast question I mean I I
[17:46] really I was thinking brother Nasir went
[17:50] to Pakistan even though we don't agree
[17:54] with a lot of things he said but he
[17:56] still did message for you he's got some
[17:58] good knowledge at least but he went to
[18:01] Pakistan
[18:01] and he said I don't preach just giving
[18:06] the ministers together and let's have a
[18:08] ministers conference and that's the way
[18:11] to do it that's really the most
[18:13] effective way to do it is go in have a
[18:17] conference with you know 100 ministers
[18:19] cuz if you have a
[18:23] you know link of the Philippines it was
[18:25] six seven hundred some people grow story
[18:27] on the church I need an effect I don't
[18:30] know if it was dirty preaches there's no
[18:32] when they got something they got it
[18:34] they're still getting it two years later
[18:36] they're still getting it and it's
[18:38] growing exponentially that way not maybe
[18:41] sometimes do the way okay he knows well
[18:44] as I do
[18:45] sure they love you because you're in
[18:47] America me because he's asking is that
[18:49] but when you leave they got to deal with
[18:52] in same ol Devils as they dealt with
[18:54] when you know the only emotion which
[18:57] brings you up and we're glad to have
[18:58] this one that's good word that's news if
[19:00] that's it but when you leave and go drop
[19:03] back down we lose we're going to pick it
[19:04] back up the preachers are gonna have to
[19:07] pick that thing back up and say oh I got
[19:09] this and now we're going to preach on
[19:11] this and now we're preaching on this and
[19:13] then we can preach on this to me that's
[19:14] the most important way of getting to
[19:18] people is through the ministry okay and
[19:22] it is and it can go both ways you can
[19:24] have some little like filters and I mean
[19:26] it's almost to have ministered meet one
[19:28] day at bill does not mean yes denial is
[19:29] the resurrection is all the web you know
[19:31] there's a lot of reason but you know
[19:34] better than that
[19:35] so what the word will what the word will
[19:40] bring the manifestation back around okay
[19:43] if it's of no use like those that
[19:47] somehow maintenance posited I've tried
[19:49] to help them I'm turning them over okay
[19:54] same thing with this message I'm telling
[19:57] you these seals are not for everybody
[20:04] these sealed sure we can all get new
[20:08] growth out of it
[20:09] but to get the fruition to get something
[20:12] that will put the fruit on the end of
[20:14] the tree we got to see that this is a
[20:17] natural happening and this is the
[20:19] spiritual happening okay all right
[20:23] because there is a certain thing called
[20:25] death of Hell I mean this power take a
[20:28] poor farmer killed with a sword with
[20:30] hunger with it we see that over in
[20:33] foreign countries they're killing them
[20:35] other thousands naturally why because of
[20:38] a spirit not because of a man we're not
[20:41] fighting men we're buying principalities
[20:43] powers spirits and not places that what
[20:45] the Bible said okay so we're fighting
[20:47] this same horse rider in the natural
[20:50] world but we're fighting this same horse
[20:53] rider in the spiritual world all right
[20:56] all right all right so this pale horse
[21:00] is what a mixture of all things he got a
[21:04] name now he's got a name remember the
[21:08] Bible says you got a name he called by
[21:09] what you did well son Holy Ghost baptism
[21:13] is dead that's what's probably God says
[21:16] he's the doctrine comes pizza hell but
[21:20] he went to dig up some this is the
[21:24] people that are baptized name puzzles no
[21:26] puzzles so you see what Donna yeah and
[21:30] and to bring this these fields coming
[21:34] from one two three the reason for is God
[21:37] we got to push everything while I'm
[21:38] trying to push everything are there it's
[21:40] because really five in its natural pure
[21:46] form is not to us six and our natural
[21:49] pure form is not to us but there is a
[21:51] spiritual application of five and six
[21:53] that there's something underneath in
[21:55] between the lines that we have to get
[21:58] back under these six the one two four
[22:02] is that confusing or that help good on
[22:05] it I mean it's a it takes all that to
[22:07] come back under this seal right here
[22:09] yeah this seal is not anything that work
[22:13] on a physically sick right you better
[22:16] not here and number six you better not
[22:21] be here
[22:22] glass the plays come in times 1 million
[22:25] you know I see that's the two prophets
[22:27] calling them just control the nature any
[22:30] way they want to but the reason like we
[22:33] were talking last night we were talking
[22:37] like a powerful ministry for those using
[22:39] weren't they will come at five fold
[22:40] ministry and we're talking about being
[22:41] prophetic this listen this is a
[22:44] prophetic days this is why you can no I
[22:48] don't like to use it word no because you
[22:50] can know about something growing I think
[22:51] there is a hammer but you get a
[22:54] revelation a prophetic revelation it for
[22:58] you as much as it is for the Bible
[23:01] mentions okay you can prophesied you can
[23:05] be prophetic yourself right as long as
[23:07] you stay under what you're supposed to
[23:09] be right and then as long as you stay
[23:12] under what sisters you can't preach the
[23:15] you can say this is what gets sticky you
[23:18] can't give me a revelation
[23:21] that's no preacher can give you right
[23:23] right no one can own one what cause it's
[23:27] prophetic it's coming straight down to
[23:30] you but it has to come through a file
[23:32] photo filter inside yes by a bold filter
[23:36] it has to come through that because you
[23:40] remember how many times you get you know
[23:41] you get a thought from God I'm doing the
[23:43] seal cuz we got to get this this is our
[23:45] this is our going home sale if I got
[23:49] this is our dope this is when the
[23:50] Seventh Seal produces itself to the
[23:53] Gentile
[23:54] alright the South still produces itself
[23:57] under the forcefield plumbing dent out
[23:59] there by clear with that alright so he's
[24:03] come here to produce yourself he's going
[24:05] to do away with death inhale this seal
[24:08] shows that death in half to death and
[24:09] he'll has got some kind of power but it
[24:12] can't be a powerless against that's
[24:15] going to overwhelm us right because
[24:17] we're going to overcome this power and
[24:19] we're going to leave come up that right
[24:22] there that's your bar from the change
[24:25] just worry about that but that is your
[24:32] bar from natural sumac
[24:35] it'll either take you to the
[24:37] supernatural or when it's destroyed
[24:40] we'll bring the supernatural here ok
[24:44] because to me that's the whole key the
[24:47] reason the 6th dimension can't come here
[24:49] because there's death here right
[24:53] but when death is destroyed in someone
[24:56] that says that program says death to
[24:59] come up your sleeve you when it means
[25:01] nothing here that's when they can come
[25:03] here and say there's still fear here
[25:06] because of the death because of that we
[25:08] die
[25:08] listen you die in this dimension if you
[25:11] pass away you pakil in this dimension
[25:13] and then whatever happens goes into
[25:15] another dimension
[25:16] five or six whichever one you say but
[25:19] that happened here but once death is
[25:21] destroyed here that's might destroy it
[25:23] in the force field not in five is it for
[25:29] us the guy for us I'm going to know from
[25:32] my kids an ash man come with the
[25:33] spiritual aspect of this 4-cyl is is
[25:37] that all this is together wrapped up
[25:41] into one
[25:42] it's just a second bathroom hose up and
[25:45] the word brother Brown says the word
[25:48] what would that quote Joe give us the
[25:52] other day man I was getting a word for
[25:54] the word was quoting the word cousin
[25:58] what the Jesus been Jesus quoted the old
[26:00] axle and he said it was the word
[26:02] quoting the word and the word
[26:05] in other words materialize out of the
[26:07] word so it's a word altogether because
[26:09] Jesus was standing that he wants the
[26:10] word he was quoting to learn he was
[26:14] quoting itself trying to say before
[26:17] Abraham one night he was he was the law
[26:21] that he was the leader before I ran the
[26:23] math in that Genesis 1:26 part we'll see
[26:27] this afternoon that was that was gone
[26:29] online you can't make them separate
[26:31] people if you may ever make yourself the
[26:34] Holy Ghost inside of you
[26:36] different from God you got to pee you
[26:38] got to beef it up right okay whatever I
[26:43] guess in 1:26 man was a part of God that
[26:45] was manifested in another form called a
[26:47] bride okay staying here this death is
[26:52] gone it's being it's being manifested
[26:54] here but now when what when we want that
[26:56] part away because look power was given
[26:58] unto them to do what they're doing
[27:03] so go ahead to watch from it that I were
[27:06] to happen so really I mean really now
[27:09] I'll read this afternoon brother Brown
[27:10] said when Jesus died he destroyed that
[27:16] he destroyed cancer he destroyed
[27:20] everything and he was he took your soul
[27:24] and your body under his rulership you -
[27:28] oh my lord yeah he did he claimed both
[27:31] of them at Calvary when he resurrected
[27:34] in that glorified body you resurrected
[27:37] with him now what we are doing is just
[27:39] make sure we believe that we'll talk
[27:42] about this afternoon but don't get
[27:43] burned on them but this pale horse
[27:46] death is hell followed with him that the
[27:49] main that sound on him was death comma
[27:51] and hell followed with him kind of
[27:54] orders that there's hell
[27:55] Hades shut so because remember there's
[27:59] no burning hell right man
[28:00] no remember
[28:02] stop talking now and there's no burning
[28:05] he'll run no there's a lake fire hell is
[28:12] to me hell is where God's not that's
[28:14] right okay
[28:16] I lived in Hell where loads up you know
[28:18] cuz I was work out one okay okay and
[28:21] that is the worst part is to know that
[28:23] you're in this place and can't get out
[28:25] what does what does the rich young ruler
[28:28] he said I would love to go to bosom
[28:32] Abraham what but laughter what he says
[28:35] you know there's a great gulf fixed
[28:36] Miller doesn't dimension that you can't
[28:38] come back across we can't come back into
[28:41] this dimension or you can't even go to
[28:42] the dimension that I'm in he said we'll
[28:45] tell my brothers or give me one temple
[28:47] of water for my column see he wasn't
[28:50] burning it would be wonderful to just go
[28:52] to mother would but if you were just a
[28:55] senator I'm just going to burn up since
[28:56] I'm getting you know soon as I get my
[28:57] judgment I'm gonna burn and I'll be gone
[29:00] done no it's going to be an ongoing
[29:02] thing it's going to be a process that
[29:04] you said someone goes through why
[29:06] because it's devoid God is nowhere to be
[29:09] saying there's no my brother instead it
[29:12] has no foundations with your skin oh I
[29:14] nearly had a dream that did you fail I
[29:18] had a dream that because that fell one
[29:20] time in a fitting will catch a hold of
[29:22] anything you know and you just keep
[29:24] telling me and it's horrible because
[29:26] you're trying to grab something there's
[29:27] nothing laughter that's my brother round
[29:29] and basically the same thing okay
[29:33] why is he killing with he's killing with
[29:34] a store now we know that naturally that
[29:36] that was happening but we know that
[29:37] spiritually he killed the worse by syrup
[29:40] spirit Authority right Satan word is
[29:44] what's killing people God word that
[29:46] killed anybody's board that not killing
[29:48] know God's Word is life okay now you
[29:51] guys kill the old anger you gotta cut
[29:53] out the old barge but when the word
[29:56] comes up like um
[29:59] Jesus was 11 he was the living word he
[30:02] lived the word that he was a friend with
[30:05] you and I you and I will live the word
[30:07] that we are all right hunger and with
[30:12] death and with the beasts of the earth
[30:15] all right shall we come to now this is
[30:20] the prophetic or Eagle anointing all
[30:23] right so we're bringing in the fourth
[30:25] beast that fourth piece trust has this
[30:28] come and see so he says come here I want
[30:30] you to show you this John this is the
[30:33] last thing that you Gentiles are going
[30:35] to see then alright because we're not
[30:39] going to see the souls under the altar
[30:40] cry how long how long has been your
[30:42] blood let me see that we're almost see
[30:45] physically the two prophets I feel that
[30:47] in the word and in Revelation and in
[30:50] prophetic insight I looking can see what
[30:53] they're going to do one closer Bible
[30:54] probably going to send us a message to
[30:57] tell us exactly who they were the spirit
[30:59] of Moses beautiful eyes are coming on to
[31:01] you over there teaching the people
[31:04] basically this message when I'm saying
[31:06] baby but that first thing I'm doing get
[31:08] them to repent first you know you know
[31:11] they killed Jesus
[31:12] don't you have to repent first and then
[31:14] I don't know that they'll all come in
[31:19] together it doesn't matter
[31:20] they got three and a half years to get
[31:22] 144,000 doesn't matter if it takes three
[31:26] years five months in 28 days but God
[31:30] said like I said last anything go I'd
[31:31] give them 1260 days and that's all they
[31:33] get once they get that 12 hour 60 days
[31:36] the door shut
[31:37] they're done there's no more be safe
[31:40] than guns going to take them off the
[31:42] earth but see that's going to happen to
[31:44] them down here but what what we're going
[31:46] to do next Sunday I'm going to review
[31:48] this just now next time we're going to
[31:50] talk about 50 will may go back to the
[31:52] portal we'll talk about the fifth seal
[31:53] and talk about its natural happening so
[31:57] it's going to happen that but you're
[31:59] going to have to watch you watch this
[32:01] fifth seal open you're going to have to
[32:05] see the natural part that you got
[32:07] I mean the supernatural work that you do
[32:09] have the revelation the prophetic I'm
[32:13] telling you we are all prophetic because
[32:16] of the anointing that were under doesn't
[32:19] matter if you know that if you know what
[32:20] it you know what about hearing the name
[32:22] Lord Jesus Christ is correct
[32:23] that's prophetic because the world
[32:26] doesn't see it that way your prophetic
[32:30] if you can read the anointing that we're
[32:32] under when you read the Bible and you
[32:34] see that it was you know what happened
[32:36] in the garden okay you got it
[32:39] look at all the people that are blinded
[32:41] the man all these always doctors did we
[32:45] take that we say are our milk you know
[32:51] what happened the garden should be milk
[32:54] but - but there's somebody just coming
[32:56] in what a powerful revelation will
[32:59] entice me because really what's going to
[33:01] happen if they don't get it go job yeah
[33:03] how many people in deep trouble really
[33:05] by telling them that and then going yes
[33:10] well what you do is you choking them
[33:12] they can't take that strong need all
[33:14] right that's why we don't need to you
[33:17] know we are we don't need to force
[33:19] marriage and divorce and the seals and
[33:21] major doctrines don't force people with
[33:25] that don't even marriage and divorce
[33:27] should never be discussed listen outside
[33:29] of your home turf I'm gonna put it right
[33:32] down to the very wet outside of your
[33:34] home church managing divorce should
[33:35] never be discussed with those you're
[33:38] just casting pearls before swine you are
[33:41] wasting your time and I said local
[33:43] church because when your local assembly
[33:45] marriage and divorce is like they're the
[33:49] case could happen in this church that
[33:51] brother Dale would handle one way and
[33:52] another brother would handle another way
[33:54] another church that's his business this
[33:55] is our business so imagine divorced
[33:57] amazing all they discussed to me would
[33:59] be discussed among us
[34:00] you see our program positions for my
[34:02] people only
[34:04] now remember it did not set I think they
[34:09] had like 2400 people at the festival
[34:11] Scoob when he was preaching that or
[34:13] something like that it was several
[34:15] thousand now when he said additions to
[34:17] my own people only and you know don't
[34:20] got the vigil do it anymore he gave him
[34:22] the great American divorce now he didn't
[34:24] give 2,400 people as medicine woman is
[34:26] it most of that grace was given outside
[34:32] of the wall but it was given to someone
[34:35] like us that needed it in this room
[34:38] right man
[34:40] we were sitting there and some weren't
[34:42] even born of 1964 a little four-year-old
[34:45] kid you know you know say one thing for
[34:47] 65 seats for six months when he gives
[34:49] the grace of management divorce so what
[34:51] am I saying
[34:52] there's layers they some people took it
[34:55] you know what some people just get
[34:56] increased polygamy and it's still free
[34:58] completely off of that marriage in the
[34:59] wars book now that's not what he breaks
[35:03] free so that's not to them that's what
[35:08] it's just to the little elect that will
[35:11] catch what's going on
[35:12] number one get the grace of marriage and
[35:15] divorce inside first yeah then you work
[35:19] on the outside I imagine right because
[35:25] you're still making old husband in the
[35:27] world
[35:27] you're committed okay already yeah so
[35:31] get that set that's why did tell about
[35:34] Jesus Christ I'm up the saving grace
[35:36] Jesus Christ and what is that that is a
[35:38] great American boy that we were married
[35:40] to another man safe and then and if you
[35:44] know if you're not divorcing this guy
[35:46] he's going to be dated let brother Ram
[35:48] say god you're the one who can kill that
[35:50] old you can't kill it
[35:53] same can't kill your own maker he
[35:54] doesn't want it here that old nightmare
[35:57] but God the only one who can kill that
[36:00] whole nature and say you are now
[36:01] divorced are not divorce you are now
[36:04] free to marry whoever you wanted marry
[36:08] me I'm going to cross your
[36:10] Matt Christ come to me all ye that labor
[36:13] heavy labor
[36:14] I'll give you I'll be your husband I'll
[36:16] be the one talking about last night
[36:18] become a minister's preaching that
[36:20] didn't have home churches so music
[36:22] whatever may I understood that well that
[36:24] means that that he's just like a rogue
[36:26] preacher right everyone has to have met
[36:29] you we are all sheep I don't care if you
[36:31] are from Samuel Dale leave ale I'll go
[36:36] to your wedding you got to have some
[36:38] kind of head not sometimes you
[36:41] answer to and you know I will come a bit
[36:43] no but you got to have some times like
[36:46] brother they'll said he won't preach in
[36:47] I agree 100% he won't appreciate about
[36:50] it they're never on Church I was neither
[36:52] why because he's just a rogue guy he's
[36:54] just out here because you want to tell
[36:57] you real quick there brother Tim hymns
[36:58] is this possible then when he ain't our
[37:00] preaching he goes to that church he
[37:02] don't stay at home - boy I've been
[37:03] preaching for five days now I don't
[37:05] think I need to go to church no sir he's
[37:07] right there in that church so see ya
[37:09] to me that's a true evangelist a true
[37:11] person that comes into this job but he's
[37:15] got to have a home church that's why he
[37:17] got out of headship crisis our head wait
[37:19] but he clipped that many brother last
[37:22] night he gave us those five gifts to
[37:26] operate through and we must operate
[37:27] through those five years whether we be a
[37:30] hostile prophet recitation man we all
[37:32] got to work under the headship of his
[37:34] Christ man Christ is our head ok same
[37:38] way here we got to see that crises are
[37:41] they're not they're not just awful thing
[37:43] here and always other stuff that will be
[37:46] that will be illuminated in the right
[37:49] way but now remember see this is where
[37:53] you got eaten you've got to be able to
[37:56] think in different level death will not
[37:58] be destroyed until we until the future
[38:02] home but there has got to be destroyed
[38:07] and the horsetail in us before we can go
[38:10] in it for the world can go any further
[38:12] because remember they still gonna be
[38:13] deaf going on when we leave that alarm
[38:16] again then you go over to the end of the
[38:21] millennium saying it's going to raise up
[38:23] an army God is going to kill all them
[38:25] demons see there's death all the way
[38:28] through there but you know what there's
[38:29] a good staff and a bad bet the good
[38:32] death between Satan died and you okay
[38:34] mmm very good there but Paul to death
[38:38] where'd you stay great were you bigger
[38:40] that's what we got to look at right here
[38:41] let's go we'll be a little bit along
[38:45] this next night and then we'll come on
[38:46] this thing
[38:47] [Music]
