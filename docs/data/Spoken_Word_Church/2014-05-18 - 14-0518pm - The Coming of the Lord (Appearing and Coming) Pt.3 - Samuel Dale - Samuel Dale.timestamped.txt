[10:34] each one
[10:36] and uh
[10:38] we got um
[10:40] 520 last night for brother Ernie
[10:44] Villanueva so we'll put it on up to at
[10:47] least 600 and send it to him with a note
[10:50] that
[10:51] he gets to pay he gets paid for
[10:53] preaching when he didn't make it
[10:56] Noel just it gets paid for preaching
[10:59] even though he didn't make it he didn't
[11:01] get to get here but the Lord will be
[11:03] with him and he'll I've told him just
[11:05] when he felt like it come on down and be
[11:08] with us but we will send him that we
[11:10] appreciate all of it appreciate all of
[11:13] the food and all the doings it's really
[11:15] been wonderful and all and and we love
[11:18] the Lord and pray that you have had a
[11:21] good weekend for the fellowship meeting
[11:23] time and and all of that and and just uh
[11:29] you know it's wonderful to be able to
[11:31] Fellowship together
[11:33] and I've never been on Fellowship like
[11:36] most everybody is
[11:39] you know it's Two Fellas and one ship
[11:43] which you know Two Fellas and one ship
[11:44] still two Fellers
[11:47] and fellowshipping that you you try to
[11:50] fellowship and you know that brother
[11:52] random said in the Bible says it
[11:55] in the upper room they were in one mind
[11:57] and one Accord
[12:01] argue with each other
[12:07] come on you're supposed to know the
[12:09] message is that the way the prophet said
[12:12] that they were sitting up there
[12:13] discussing who was the greatest and what
[12:15] was going on and and what was going to
[12:18] be and they need to just say well we
[12:19] need to take it by faith and leave out
[12:21] what the Bible said it was in one mind
[12:24] and one Accord
[12:27] you know we'll never be like people
[12:29] think
[12:31] of getting together
[12:33] you know and everybody having the same
[12:36] ideas
[12:37] we're a body of Christ
[12:39] around the world but that's one goal
[12:42] they were ending up a room for one goal
[12:45] one purpose
[12:46] they were told to go wait
[12:50] they didn't just sit up there
[12:54] well we don't know what we're waiting on
[12:55] we waiting
[12:58] when they got through down there and the
[13:00] Holy Spirit did come they said this is
[13:02] that
[13:05] one mind and one Accord is not just
[13:07] everybody saying dog and cat and
[13:09] preaching the same and you know how
[13:12] people are on that though they say you
[13:14] know we would all be in Great Fellowship
[13:16] once we get together what they mean is
[13:18] once you come to their way of thinking
[13:22] well that just never will work
[13:24] I believe the bride around the world has
[13:26] got one mind and one Accord
[13:30] we're striving to bring this
[13:34] flesh that we are being in subjection to
[13:37] God to walk off of this Earth
[13:40] in a Rapture because what else would you
[13:42] want
[13:44] and we're in that time and I hope you
[13:46] I'll try to review it just a little this
[13:48] evening I hope he was listening this
[13:50] morning
[13:51] to what I was saying you know about the
[13:55] fact of
[13:58] the invisible
[14:01] see we look back there is visible we
[14:03] look over with ours visible and fail to
[14:06] see how visible he really is right now
[14:09] Among Us
[14:11] and what he's doing
[14:13] amen John 1
[14:16] John 2 excuse Lord Jesus we love you
[14:21] And We Praise Your Great Name and we ask
[14:23] you to just bless us and guide us
[14:26] be with each and every one Lord and we
[14:27] know that Wade was having trouble this
[14:30] morning with his stroke so we pray that
[14:32] you would bless him as he's able to
[14:33] minister this afternoon
[14:35] and pray that the people would really
[14:37] enjoy what he's having to say
[14:40] and Lord give them fruit for your labor
[14:43] and Lord that you maybe be the honor and
[14:47] Glory of us all is our desire have your
[14:49] way with us bless brother Douglas them
[14:51] on the way home traveling and Lord just
[14:53] let your light shine in their hearts and
[14:55] lives we thank you for all things and we
[14:58] committed to you now in Jesus name
[15:00] amen
[15:03] now we've been reading this and reading
[15:05] Thessalonians and then come into this so
[15:07] now we're going to try to pick up a
[15:08] little bit
[15:11] verse 26.
[15:12] John 2
[15:16] these things have I written unto you
[15:19] concerning them that seduce you
[15:23] no
[15:25] somebody is
[15:27] trying to pervert things right
[15:30] but the anointing which you have
[15:32] received of him abideth in you
[15:36] and you need not any man teach you
[15:42] well look at that we don't need no
[15:44] teachers we don't need nobody to teach
[15:46] us
[15:48] the Bible says it
[15:51] but he just said
[15:53] people are trying to seduce you
[15:57] the prophet said if we didn't
[16:00] need teaching why do you put teachers in
[16:02] the body you know
[16:05] so see we we're supposed to know the
[16:07] truth
[16:09] but you need not any not that any man
[16:12] teach you
[16:14] nobody can teach you nobody can
[16:17] but it's the same anointing teaches you
[16:20] of all things
[16:22] in this truth
[16:24] and there's no lie and even I see that
[16:27] taught you
[16:28] you should abide in him
[16:31] that should be the same anointing all
[16:32] around the world the same Holy Spirit
[16:34] that's what I believed it was don't you
[16:39] now little children abide in him that
[16:42] when he shall appear
[16:43] we may have confidence and not be
[16:46] ashamed before him
[16:48] at his coming you may be seated
[16:51] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[16:55] of the word now
[17:01] to back up just a little bit this
[17:03] morning to in our thoughts
[17:06] and all and we'll try to speak a little
[17:08] bit the Lord willing Wednesday
[17:10] on this and then we'll have questions
[17:13] and answers and things
[17:15] relating to it and I pray that if you
[17:17] got any points talks that you would
[17:20] write them down we could try to cover
[17:22] them
[17:24] on this that we've been talking about
[17:27] and what have we been doing
[17:30] talking about that
[17:32] the Rapture is a process
[17:36] that is taking place
[17:38] we're not waiting for it to start
[17:40] it already has started within us
[17:44] there's many things that will take place
[17:46] that are not finished yet
[17:49] because we're still here
[17:51] all right
[17:52] but a lot that we would be looking for
[17:55] has already happened
[17:59] you know or taking place
[18:04] and then we find that all of it takes
[18:06] place here
[18:08] before we go there
[18:11] because we're going to be changed here
[18:12] the day is going to be raised here
[18:15] the shout's going to be here
[18:18] unfortunately Arcane was here the
[18:21] trumpet together us together he's here
[18:25] and then we go there
[18:28] the the part of going there is the
[18:32] effect or what do you call it the
[18:36] finishing part of what's going on here
[18:41] all right then we went in to relate the
[18:44] two together and compare
[18:48] the coming of the Lord
[18:52] and there's many things related to the
[18:54] coming of the Lord but we're only
[18:56] concerned with what's related to us as
[18:59] the bride
[19:01] all right
[19:03] and we know that
[19:06] Jesus has already come the first time
[19:09] so his coming is in a process
[19:12] that is taking place
[19:14] all right
[19:16] I'm trying to get you and I to see
[19:19] something is going on
[19:24] I've had some dreams lately about some
[19:26] things and
[19:28] if I interpreted them the way that I
[19:31] thought my human mind would run I would
[19:34] be gone out to preach
[19:38] to the world
[19:41] if I went according to my mind
[19:43] of what I've thought to dreams would be
[19:46] if I told you the dreams you would
[19:48] probably think so too
[19:51] but
[19:53] I don't think that's right I think it's
[19:55] the point
[19:57] of what I've been trying to say to you
[19:59] is we've got to see something personal
[20:04] quit looking for the past
[20:06] and not you know quit looking at the
[20:08] president and see what's going on
[20:10] right now Among Us and taking place
[20:15] so then Rapture is already in process
[20:20] the coming of the Lord is in a process
[20:24] he's already come to to redeem the bride
[20:27] right that was his first coming
[20:31] to pay the price to die for sins
[20:34] that was his coming
[20:38] and we're now in the second stage or
[20:41] Advent or
[20:43] thought of
[20:45] his coming to you and I not to nobody
[20:48] else now
[20:50] and see then
[20:52] the third part of this
[20:55] would be when we come back with him into
[20:59] the millennium
[21:01] because that will really be the second
[21:04] coming of Jesus Christ
[21:08] will be finished in the coming with him
[21:12] into the millennium that will bring to
[21:15] pass the ending of it
[21:19] but to think about it see then
[21:21] everything is related to this part
[21:27] as I said about the shout the voice of
[21:30] the Archangel and a trumpet we better be
[21:32] concerned right here in the middle
[21:34] where we're talking about the voice of
[21:37] the Archangel and the resurrection and
[21:39] the things because
[21:41] that's what it's supposed to be
[21:43] all right
[21:45] so in the coming of the lord it's not
[21:47] the first coming
[21:49] we can read about that
[21:51] it's written down we can read about it
[21:55] we're concerned with the part that's
[21:57] relating to you and I
[21:59] of the time to come to catch away the
[22:02] bride
[22:04] all right
[22:05] we're not worried about coming into the
[22:07] millennium
[22:10] that's a long ways off
[22:12] all right
[22:15] so it's being concerned with what's
[22:17] right here now
[22:21] right here now
[22:23] all right now
[22:25] watch the message part as we try to
[22:29] cover it
[22:32] see then as we ended up this morning
[22:34] talking about the
[22:39] then he would become visible Among Us
[22:43] and raise the Dead
[22:45] and we're going to rapture
[22:47] the prophet said now he was visible back
[22:49] there
[22:51] all right but we want to put that
[22:53] fleshly right but that wasn't the way he
[22:55] put it remember
[22:57] he put it to them
[22:59] to the resurrection
[23:03] because there was something there
[23:06] after that Resurrection
[23:08] that he was not dire as a
[23:12] 16 element body
[23:16] you know he was there in a glorified
[23:18] body
[23:21] that was the same body that was at one
[23:24] point 16 elements
[23:27] but it had become eternal
[23:30] glorified
[23:31] all right
[23:34] and then he covers that
[23:36] point and he said that was the alpha
[23:40] and said then there's not much down
[23:42] through the heart in the middle
[23:45] about his appearing I mean about his the
[23:49] doing
[23:50] visible
[23:51] but then he brings it right down to the
[23:53] end time we're read
[23:55] and he's become visible Among Us
[23:58] not in the gifts he said
[24:02] not into just the things that took place
[24:07] yet he become visible
[24:13] physically
[24:17] see this is a coming
[24:20] the coming of the Lord is to each
[24:23] individual
[24:27] it's not a group coming
[24:30] it's not even as much as as the two of
[24:32] the two witnesses
[24:34] that will be more or less the Gathering
[24:36] Together in groups
[24:38] this is to an individual
[24:42] so then he can be right here right now
[24:47] in one person
[24:49] that they can already recognize what's
[24:51] taking place
[24:54] see what's going on
[24:56] and the person sitting beside of them
[25:00] wondering what's going on
[25:05] to one person
[25:08] he can be already coming
[25:11] into being within them
[25:14] but to another person
[25:17] they don't know what's going on
[25:21] if you're sitting in a denominational
[25:23] church today
[25:25] they would be talking about
[25:28] you know more or less the upgrader forms
[25:30] of them
[25:32] they would be talking about a
[25:34] rapture
[25:36] we talked about that in the Baptist
[25:38] Church
[25:39] you know
[25:41] and we talked about the coming of the
[25:43] Lord
[25:45] but we had it as a great big hollering
[25:48] Shout
[25:49] and some Archangel that would step down
[25:51] and raise the dead and
[25:54] some trumpet that we would hear around
[25:57] the world and and we'd say ever I shall
[26:01] see him well that's scripture right
[26:06] but the only position
[26:08] that I know of that I said this morning
[26:10] even with the internets even with all
[26:13] the TV everything you have there's
[26:16] places in this world today that every
[26:18] eye would not see him
[26:20] if he was here
[26:23] now the only way that I know that can be
[26:26] fulfilled into ever I see him I'm seeing
[26:29] me now
[26:31] without to be in the millennium
[26:34] when he would come back to
[26:37] the Earth
[26:39] you know and they would see him coming
[26:43] because remember in that the Millennium
[26:46] somebody's going to precede us here
[26:49] they're going to build houses and a
[26:52] temple
[26:54] Etc
[26:55] and then we are going to be the
[26:58] anointing to the temple
[27:00] according to the message of the Daniel
[27:02] 70 weeks
[27:05] all right then that way you could see
[27:07] that they could see
[27:09] ever I shall see him
[27:12] well see we got it figured out oh
[27:14] wherever I'll see him he'll be coming
[27:16] around the world some way
[27:19] you know
[27:24] but yet
[27:26] what if some of those things had already
[27:28] taken place
[27:31] and we've missed it
[27:35] what if it is
[27:37] shout was this message that was brought
[27:40] brother prophet
[27:41] you know brought to us
[27:45] what if the voice of the Archangel is
[27:47] the
[27:48] the Lord Jesus Christ in the bride of
[27:50] Christ
[27:53] did he be visible Among Us and race dead
[27:55] and we're going to rapture
[27:59] what if it is that the trumpet is a
[28:01] gathering
[28:04] of the people together
[28:07] the prophet said after the resurrection
[28:11] he said we'll all go up together
[28:14] hey all right
[28:17] the Bible says we'll all be changed
[28:20] okay
[28:23] so what if that's true that that's
[28:25] already a lot of it taking place then
[28:28] look how far we would be in the second
[28:31] Advent or talk
[28:33] of the coming of the Lord
[28:38] that
[28:39] he came back to her
[28:41] we came back in the end time with the
[28:43] sign of the son of man
[28:47] as I said your Scholars your writers
[28:51] you very little of it Scofield talked
[28:55] some of it
[28:57] even the great Apostle Paul the writers
[29:00] of the scriptures
[29:01] Peter James John
[29:06] now in the gospels they wrote of the son
[29:08] of man that was when he was alive and
[29:10] what he was saying
[29:12] but
[29:13] none of those
[29:14] writers even the great Apostle Paul
[29:17] spoke of the son of man
[29:23] no
[29:24] I'm trying to get you to see this part
[29:27] of what I was trying to get this morning
[29:29] of being visible Among Us
[29:34] see so he was back there we know
[29:37] but then the great secret was lost
[29:42] from mankind
[29:44] really it never did come into being as a
[29:47] matter of fact
[29:48] because the prophet said The Headstone
[29:50] hadn't come yet
[29:52] it's his words
[29:54] but it's to come in the end time all
[29:56] right
[29:57] now I believe that headstone
[30:00] was the opening of those Seven Seals and
[30:03] this prophet's message
[30:06] the entire message not just part
[30:11] That's The Headstone to the church
[30:14] all right
[30:15] but if we're not familiar with that
[30:19] how would we know anything else
[30:22] that would transpire
[30:25] how are you supposed to check the uh
[30:32] like we started off reading that
[30:35] you know
[30:36] how are you supposed to check people's
[30:39] doctrines and ideas
[30:42] by the word
[30:47] by the word but if you don't know the
[30:49] word how can you check them
[30:53] you know
[30:56] and then especially when they come and
[30:58] give you the Bible says a sign
[31:04] and the sign come to pass the scripture
[31:06] says
[31:09] we yet they take you to another God
[31:11] not to listen to them
[31:14] he said cause I fit that among you
[31:17] try you
[31:20] is that you're talking to the prophet
[31:23] is it the fact that
[31:25] he would permit
[31:27] even great things to take place he would
[31:30] have to permit the sign to come to pass
[31:32] wouldn't he
[31:34] any do that you mean God would do that
[31:37] to his little bride
[31:39] I believe it's uh
[31:42] gone to this evil age or one
[31:45] where he says
[31:46] that he'll let these come among us to
[31:49] prove that we won't fall like Eve
[31:54] he wants a bride
[31:56] that he can trust
[31:59] I used to have a buddy when I was out in
[32:01] the world
[32:02] and me and him didn't get in a lot of
[32:04] trouble
[32:05] but
[32:07] I didn't have no fear
[32:09] when we were together
[32:12] because I knew he would be at my back
[32:17] and whatever took place
[32:19] you know we'd be together
[32:21] because he was my friend you know
[32:25] well see I believe the Lord wants a
[32:27] bride that he can
[32:29] put his confidence in
[32:33] that he'll even allow things to go wrong
[32:39] do you know that if now other than what
[32:42] we call the the things of the world of I
[32:45] don't believe ever bad coal is is that
[32:48] the Lord has to say put the bad cold on
[32:51] him you know no no it's just a part of
[32:54] the world
[32:56] but he can't put death on you
[33:00] the devil came unless God permits it
[33:04] which you know what he permits it
[33:09] but but brother Dale I thought he was a
[33:12] loving God he is
[33:15] but you know what he wants us to love
[33:17] him
[33:18] for what he is
[33:23] you don't want us to love him because it
[33:25] he has healed us delivered us
[33:29] he wants us to love him even if he don't
[33:31] do it
[33:35] then he will do it because it won't be
[33:38] no backup
[33:41] but you see this thing is a little
[33:43] different we think
[33:44] all right
[33:46] then
[33:47] if it's coming is already in process
[33:52] there would be
[33:54] a large amount of scripture
[33:57] would already be fulfilled
[34:01] right
[34:04] and as I was saying then to fulfill that
[34:07] scripture would bring what it brought
[34:10] Christ
[34:11] the son of man
[34:13] all right
[34:14] now these sort of man deals with
[34:17] Resurrection
[34:22] that's why you know Jesus said to son of
[34:24] man has power
[34:26] it deals for the resurrection
[34:28] he had the resurrection sign all right
[34:30] now
[34:32] when did odd then as I was explaining
[34:35] that nobody knew about these things of
[34:37] the son of man
[34:38] and here comes the little old man out of
[34:40] Kentucky with a seventh grade education
[34:43] and he starts in the 40s and the 30s
[34:46] we don't have the recordings until 47.
[34:50] but in the 30s in things and coming on
[34:53] down he would be speaking of the son of
[34:56] man
[34:58] but what writer Authority would demand
[35:02] be bringing out things that even the
[35:04] theologians
[35:06] even Nepal didn't mention
[35:13] he evidently he was a prophet
[35:18] all right
[35:19] and then he would stand as I said this
[35:22] morning turn and say
[35:25] like Sarah you know laughing behind him
[35:28] and said why is your life
[35:29] and he would stand and say
[35:32] there's a man sitting in the balcony in
[35:34] a bath you know the Baptist
[35:37] behind me here with
[35:40] just dying which it does sayeth the Lord
[35:42] is healed
[35:44] and he said that's the same sign
[35:50] you can't deny that even in the early
[35:53] Ministry of brother random
[35:56] that he had to sign of the son of man
[36:02] he said bring me 24 of your worst cases
[36:06] and I'll guarantee you healing for him
[36:08] now where's a man ever been able to
[36:10] stand and do that
[36:14] that didn't make him the Lord Jesus no
[36:17] that's where people went wrong
[36:20] because it couldn't look past and see
[36:22] that that son of man was the one inside
[36:25] of him
[36:27] declaring the gospel unto you and I
[36:33] it's hard for people to follow it
[36:35] and I'd admit it'd be hard for us too
[36:38] like we've listened the other day you
[36:40] remember when the the uh brother Banks
[36:42] would in them that you know
[36:45] I mean before we went fishing
[36:47] he was sitting out there and he said
[36:49] we're gonna I'm gonna catch one and then
[36:51] just do it this will happen that'll
[36:53] happen and
[36:54] nobody won't catch no more
[36:57] they go fishing you know and
[37:00] everything's just the way said it
[37:04] the man had to admit he said well if a
[37:06] man can see Fish before he catches them
[37:09] you know
[37:10] but you know
[37:14] that was something that you and I can't
[37:17] do
[37:19] and I wouldn't want to do it
[37:22] I have enough trouble with what little
[37:24] Ministry I have
[37:25] I wouldn't want that ability
[37:29] because it carries a lot of weight to it
[37:32] but he had the sign of the son of man
[37:36] all right
[37:37] but what was it down Through the Ages
[37:44] you know it's the same Holy Ghost right
[37:50] you had to sick heal the dead raised
[37:53] you're in all kinds of things
[37:57] either Martin or Columbo one it was
[37:59] recorded how many times has he raised
[38:00] the dead and even a great man one of
[38:03] them Smith wiggled I don't know now if I
[38:04] get them wrong you you put tonight but
[38:06] one man that had 17 people raised in the
[38:09] Dead
[38:12] and wouldn't even a church-aged
[38:13] messenger
[38:15] huh
[38:18] what was going on during that as we talk
[38:22] about the Alpha and the Omega
[38:24] and brother random would say nothing in
[38:27] between
[38:28] but then he'd say Alpha and Amiga and
[38:31] everything in between
[38:33] and people say see you was back there
[38:36] I said he's over here
[38:40] and he wasn't doing nothing down through
[38:41] there now that's just one of those
[38:44] deceiving lies
[38:46] because the sick ever was healed the
[38:48] dead has Ever Raised I don't care who
[38:50] was standing there if the Beatles prayed
[38:52] a prayer and a person was healed
[38:55] and God done the healing The Beatles
[38:57] didn't do it
[38:59] all right
[39:02] well see I want to approach that part
[39:04] with you and to think about it
[39:08] that
[39:10] he emphasized visible back there
[39:15] and then he brought it over to our day
[39:17] and emphasizes visible
[39:22] and not much down between there and his
[39:25] scene you know
[39:27] he said we've had to give us we've had
[39:28] the great things we've had healings
[39:33] but he left it as
[39:34] being something more visible
[39:37] in the last days
[39:39] all right
[39:41] so now
[39:42] if that be right
[39:45] let's get into something that maybe
[39:46] these little wording here
[39:49] that we've just read
[39:51] in the scriptures
[39:53] would give us an understanding
[39:57] to help us to see what has taken place
[39:59] what is taking place and by that we'll
[40:03] know what is going to take place
[40:05] so now let's read over again go ahead
[40:07] and pull up number 1A which is first
[40:10] John
[40:12] 2 28. and let's just read that and look
[40:16] at that scripture and follow it
[40:23] now
[40:28] think about it
[40:31] now little children abide in him
[40:33] that when he shall appear
[40:36] we may have confidence
[40:39] and not be ashamed before him
[40:42] at his coming
[40:46] and he's talking about two things
[40:50] appearing
[40:53] and coming
[40:56] all right if we get it
[40:58] if we if we're in on it and abide in him
[41:02] and confine his appearing
[41:05] then we can be ready for his coming
[41:09] so then remember what I said this
[41:11] morning
[41:13] and what I've always emphasized
[41:15] don't go down to the bus depot to wait
[41:19] on an airplane
[41:22] it won't come by there
[41:25] all right
[41:27] be in the right place
[41:29] if we can follow the appearing
[41:32] most of you know the quotes and time
[41:36] but think about it if we can follow the
[41:38] appearing
[41:41] then we can comprehend the coming but if
[41:43] we just go straight to his coming
[41:46] without seeing what's been going on
[41:49] what would we have
[41:51] you would have an alpha that he was Dire
[41:54] and an Omega over here and nothing in
[41:57] between
[41:58] and I don't believe that
[42:01] even the Bible said he stood in the Mist
[42:04] of the seven golden candlesticks well
[42:07] that would put him
[42:08] if you're going to be carnal with your
[42:10] understanding that would put him more in
[42:14] the middle Church ages
[42:19] right
[42:22] then in the beginning or the ending I
[42:24] mean if you're going to Mississippi
[42:25] Carnival
[42:28] but I believe it's like the prophet
[42:30] priest he's the same in every age
[42:34] it's us it changed
[42:37] because my wife likes to say it it was
[42:39] not the
[42:41] spirit that was taken away
[42:43] in no age God has been the Holy Ghost in
[42:45] every age
[42:48] is the word
[42:51] the word is what God ate either way
[42:53] Spirit was still there
[42:56] right because you can't do away with the
[42:58] spirit of God
[43:00] all right
[43:01] and see then to look at it
[43:05] we know that
[43:07] something is being said by the great
[43:09] John
[43:11] who at this time had already been to
[43:13] Patmos
[43:15] and came back
[43:17] the Little John's as we call them one
[43:18] two and three was written after John
[43:20] went to Patmos that's why he could talk
[43:22] about the Antichrist when no one else
[43:24] even uses the word Antichrist
[43:28] he could talk about the great love of
[43:30] God because he saw it
[43:33] all right so he could talk about his
[43:35] appearing
[43:36] in his coming
[43:41] so now let's read a little bit and see
[43:43] what he says
[43:46] we've been over these many years ago in
[43:48] many different times but
[43:49] go ahead to number one which is the end
[43:52] time evangelism
[43:55] 1962 603 paragraph 50. same thing today
[44:00] when you see his work
[44:01] now we have already seen and are
[44:04] witnessing the appearing of the Lord
[44:09] now remember
[44:10] appearing and coming
[44:13] is two different words
[44:16] Amen to appear
[44:19] and then to come
[44:22] so which one comes first
[44:24] appearing
[44:27] and then coming
[44:29] now is the appearing
[44:34] he's already appeared in these last days
[44:37] right here with us in the last few years
[44:41] now it's a sign of this coming
[44:48] he's appearing in his church in the form
[44:50] of the Holy Spirit
[44:51] showing that it's him
[44:53] because people cannot do these things
[44:55] that you see the Holy Spirit doing so
[44:58] that's the appearing of the Lord
[45:00] now remember
[45:02] it spoke both places appearing and
[45:06] coming
[45:07] now
[45:10] think about what I've been trying to
[45:12] bring then
[45:16] the first part of his coming is already
[45:18] a past tense form
[45:21] because he paid the price
[45:24] we're in the Advent of his
[45:26] coming to the bride
[45:29] and I believe he's coming over age to
[45:32] the bride
[45:34] all right
[45:36] sure if he's Alpha and Omega and it's
[45:39] looking like it's something of great on
[45:40] each end
[45:42] what is in between
[45:48] I believe he's been appearing I believe
[45:50] that's what the prophet is trying to
[45:51] explain
[45:55] he's explaining appearing
[46:00] see and that appearing means
[46:03] something that you can
[46:05] see taking place
[46:09] but then why would it be speaking why
[46:12] would John say
[46:13] in his coming
[46:17] why would the writer speak of
[46:21] that people will love his appearing
[46:29] all right then I'm trying to break it
[46:31] down for you to understand
[46:37] so then he was back there
[46:40] in the resurrection visible
[46:45] at that time he started a process
[46:50] of his coming
[46:55] and I believe the church ages is the
[46:57] coming of the Lord
[46:58] to them
[47:00] but not coming like it's supposed to be
[47:03] finished up
[47:05] so we'll call that the appearing of the
[47:08] Lord
[47:11] these appearing
[47:14] great signs and wonders are transpiring
[47:17] to the church ages
[47:20] but yet in the end time
[47:22] something started happening about his
[47:25] coming
[47:28] when a little man began to speak of
[47:31] the son of man
[47:33] well that would have to deal with his
[47:35] coming
[47:38] he's the son of man
[47:40] that's the purpose of Son of Man
[47:44] because it is the coming of the son of
[47:45] man
[47:48] all right now to take you off the hook
[47:49] to look for anything physical remember
[47:52] this morning we spoke of it we always
[47:54] speak of it that he's not to be here
[47:56] physical Among Us
[48:01] because he doesn't set foot on Earth in
[48:03] a Corporal body until the Millennium or
[48:05] whatever you want to talk about a body
[48:08] huh
[48:10] so down to the age
[48:13] it was his appearing
[48:17] and then here in the end time there was
[48:19] a prophet came to a work of restoration
[48:23] would have to be brought
[48:26] it took him 33 years to be able to
[48:29] preach the statue of perfect man that's
[48:31] what he said
[48:35] all right
[48:37] in doing it he had to make a a work of
[48:40] restoration
[48:42] back to the faith of the fathers
[48:47] then as he said not in preparation but
[48:51] said when the message begin to sound
[48:55] but it runs message really for what he
[48:57] come to bring started in 63.
[49:02] all right
[49:03] the other was restoration
[49:08] right all right so you can see him as
[49:10] he's talking about as we just read that
[49:13] he's now peering
[49:18] he was back there bringing the word he's
[49:22] appearing Among Us
[49:26] and as I was bringing out the other
[49:28] night he even thought himself he'd
[49:30] preached the seals he thought he'd
[49:32] preached all of Malachi 4. he thought
[49:34] everything was finished
[49:36] but he began to study for a little
[49:38] message called spoken words Original
[49:40] Seed
[49:43] and he got up there and he saw it and
[49:46] brought it and laid that down so
[49:49] wonderful
[49:51] but he realized there was no rapture
[49:55] no change
[49:57] so we remember
[49:59] he said Lord what can I do said I got
[50:01] him out on the limb
[50:06] nowhere to go
[50:08] yeah I don't let him get that nowhere to
[50:10] go that's the best way of staying there
[50:11] right good point yeah
[50:14] Holy Spirit said pick up your pen
[50:17] and he started writing
[50:19] and what the prophet had preached up to
[50:21] that point you check it
[50:24] the Holy Spirit reviewed that exactly
[50:27] of what he was bringing
[50:30] and got up right where he was standing
[50:32] with nowhere to go
[50:37] the Holy Spirit spoke not right around
[50:39] him
[50:40] the Holy Spirit spoke and says
[50:43] as of yet Malachi 4 is not finished
[50:48] that was the six hour sermon on spoken
[50:50] words Original Seed
[50:55] well you know what he done
[50:58] what do you mean I preached Malachi 4. I
[51:01] am Malachi 4. you told me I've Malachi
[51:04] 4. you witnessed I was Malachi for you
[51:07] said my message with forerun
[51:12] right
[51:16] and he says
[51:19] well if it's not fulfilled
[51:21] I I guess I'd better start moving on
[51:26] to see about getting this fulfilled
[51:28] don't you think so don't you think that
[51:30] right there immediately in his mind
[51:31] never came a total answer to the whole
[51:37] thing but in his mind came a doing that
[51:41] if it's not here and he's speaking of it
[51:47] and that means one day it can be brought
[51:50] to pass
[51:53] I told you one day the Lord spoke to me
[51:55] and after all the years and you know how
[51:57] hard I preach and
[51:59] not challenging the world to a debate no
[52:01] but it's to the point of believing the
[52:04] message the Lord said you preached the
[52:07] message and I'll back it up
[52:10] you heard me say that many times haven't
[52:11] you
[52:13] well what did I do well we mean Lord
[52:16] I've been preaching the message best I
[52:18] know the I started being more and more
[52:21] sincere and more careful
[52:24] about the way that I approach the things
[52:29] well see I don't have to back off of
[52:30] that now because we've seen the dead
[52:31] raise the sick healed
[52:33] we've seen God move
[52:35] so I don't know how to back up from that
[52:38] all right
[52:39] but get it now
[52:41] down Through the Ages it was
[52:45] not his visibility
[52:47] visible in the end beginning visibility
[52:49] and
[52:51] Through the Ages you can speak of the
[52:53] appearing
[52:54] and even up into the prophets Ministry
[52:57] the Lord was appearing
[52:59] he said his coming is not
[53:03] there's something about it
[53:06] you say I believe now this is me
[53:08] personal okay
[53:10] I believe when those seals broke to that
[53:12] prophet
[53:14] he stopped looking then for the Lord to
[53:17] come
[53:21] and he started being like he said and we
[53:23] were talking downstairs somebody quoted
[53:25] it today
[53:27] maybe brother Douglas where he said
[53:29] Paul Revere said he's coming
[53:32] he said I'm saying he's here
[53:35] he wasn't looking anymore for the coming
[53:37] of the Lord
[53:39] I believe he was looking at
[53:41] the coming of the Lord or what words
[53:43] you'd like to use in that form
[53:45] he knew it was transpiring
[53:51] and he knew before
[53:54] 64-65 on the Rapture 65
[53:59] he knew the shout was the message go run
[54:01] it into your computer
[54:05] he knew this out was the message that
[54:07] had been brought that he had brought
[54:11] and he's looking at it like a
[54:14] something that
[54:16] Lord I know
[54:19] and see you'd have to be a minister a
[54:21] lot of times to understand another
[54:23] Minister and I know that's hard
[54:27] but
[54:29] that Prophet when he seen it
[54:32] he said Lord you've been appearing here
[54:33] Among Us run it in your computer
[54:35] appearing and coming
[54:37] and just read all of the things a lot of
[54:39] them are related to different things you
[54:41] know
[54:44] but he said Lord
[54:47] now it's time
[54:49] the Lord said okay get ready
[54:53] he starts trying to preach around and up
[54:55] and down and moving along to our lives
[54:58] to 62.
[55:00] dream starts happening Vision starts
[55:03] coming
[55:04] and he's heading west
[55:09] I believe
[55:11] that in 63 when the seals were broke to
[55:14] the prophet
[55:16] now the way I'm saying it you listen to
[55:18] it because it's the way I believe it
[55:21] he wasn't told out there in Arizona what
[55:24] to do you go read your message
[55:27] he was told to go home
[55:29] it'll be told to you
[55:32] a lot of people think he was taken up
[55:33] into the clouds and told everything
[55:34] right there if he did now something
[55:37] happened because when he come back
[55:39] he preached
[55:41] um
[55:42] what was it God in Simplicity and he
[55:46] preached the breach
[55:47] and on there he said I don't know what
[55:49] that first seal is
[55:54] well everybody thinks he was took up out
[55:56] there and told it he's the one who said
[55:58] that I didn't
[56:01] you're the one making him a liar
[56:06] he said
[56:07] he met him out there and told him to
[56:09] come back home and be told him what to
[56:11] do
[56:13] but when he comes down to the end of the
[56:15] week
[56:17] he's talking about the coming of the
[56:20] Lord
[56:22] right
[56:23] and he said this great seventh seal the
[56:26] coming of the Lord
[56:29] if you knew right there the message was
[56:31] right
[56:33] and that he had brought the man the
[56:35] message and everything from their own
[56:37] came out of the seals
[56:40] now are we in the message
[56:42] he said the rapture
[56:45] came out of the seals
[56:48] said marriage and divorce was revealed
[56:51] in the seals
[56:53] the future home was revealed in the
[56:55] seals
[56:56] well I didn't hear him preach it I heard
[56:58] every message I've heard him 10 times I
[57:00] ain't never heard him that's the way it
[57:02] goes see you you're trying to figure it
[57:04] out
[57:07] and you'll never know what God was
[57:09] revealing to the man what was he saying
[57:13] he realized what he was saying to me was
[57:15] a point that once those seals broke the
[57:19] entire Bible was unveiled before him
[57:22] didn't mean he understood every word of
[57:24] he didn't know what it was
[57:26] it was unveiled
[57:30] and by being unveiled
[57:32] he could look at it
[57:34] see the great things
[57:36] I believe if he was still here today
[57:38] he'd be preaching don't you what would
[57:40] he be now hundred and
[57:43] three or four years old
[57:47] but he'd still be doing the best he
[57:49] could do
[57:51] why because there's so much in that word
[57:55] right
[57:57] what are you following me
[58:00] why would he emphasize so much
[58:03] and say there's a difference in the
[58:05] appearing in the coming
[58:07] and he would say he's appearing now
[58:08] Among Us
[58:10] getting ready for his coming
[58:13] huh
[58:14] and if you'll notice the statements are
[58:16] basically right in the 60 to 62 area
[58:22] all right so let's read a couple of them
[58:24] so you won't miss it
[58:26] letting off the pressure 1962.
[58:33] but if you can beat all that away from
[58:35] you say Lord God I believe just exactly
[58:38] what your word says and I believe as we
[58:41] preached last night
[58:43] that the appearing of the Lord comes
[58:45] before the coming of the Lord
[58:48] for it's just two different words
[58:50] altogether see now is the appearing as
[58:54] he promised in the last days
[58:56] that he'd be with us
[58:59] appearing
[59:02] we're going to the next one
[59:05] is I be not afraid
[59:08] 62. you know there's a difference
[59:11] between the appearing of Christ and the
[59:12] coming of Christ that's two different
[59:14] words altogether he's appearing now in
[59:16] his church we see him we know it's him
[59:19] it's the Holy Spirit see we know it is
[59:26] there's a difference
[59:30] watch him now this is it goes on into
[59:32] e66 that was 61.
[59:36] there's a difference
[59:38] there's a difference there's a different
[59:41] word used the appearing of Christ and
[59:43] the coming of Christ see it's two
[59:45] different words altogether now Christ is
[59:47] appearing in these last days in his
[59:49] church bringing his church together in
[59:51] unity and faith and Power in the word
[59:53] and all together that when he returns he
[59:56] will find the same church what the
[59:59] Pummel worm left the canker we're
[1:00:00] meeting what the king of worm and all
[1:00:02] now
[1:00:05] see he's bringing into his church
[1:00:10] now a scripture comes into mind with me
[1:00:15] and Jesus said
[1:00:18] the paraphrasing sorry
[1:00:21] see when he returns will he find faith
[1:00:25] you remember that in the scripture
[1:00:27] when he returns will he find faith
[1:00:31] you know that's a questionable
[1:00:34] you know when he returns he'll only find
[1:00:37] faith in the bride
[1:00:43] that's horrible isn't it to think of the
[1:00:45] religious world today around the world
[1:00:48] claims to be all of this and the other
[1:00:50] but he'll only find faith in the bride
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:56] two different words
[1:01:00] look at this one we would see Jesus 62 6
[1:01:04] 27. now we're at the West Coast
[1:01:08] and the so sun is appearing before he's
[1:01:10] coming remember appearing and coming is
[1:01:12] two different words he's appearing now
[1:01:15] in the church showing himself a lot
[1:01:16] after two thousand years serves we would
[1:01:18] see Jesus
[1:01:20] now
[1:01:25] so there's a difference in the appearing
[1:01:27] of the Lord and the coming of the Lord
[1:01:31] now may I illustrate it this way
[1:01:39] right over here in this church
[1:01:41] you know that he can appear over there
[1:01:44] and heal the sick
[1:01:47] raise the Dead
[1:01:50] cast out devils
[1:01:52] and don't you see it around the world
[1:01:53] what's taking place
[1:01:55] he's appearing is among the organized
[1:01:58] religions of the world
[1:02:00] and great things are taking place are
[1:02:03] you going to deny the sick being healed
[1:02:05] are you going to say them people healed
[1:02:07] them
[1:02:08] no I'm not
[1:02:10] I'm going to say what I did this morning
[1:02:11] if the Beatles prayed for you and God
[1:02:14] healed you it wasn't the Beatles
[1:02:17] it was God that done the healing so if
[1:02:21] there's any sick healed anywhere God is
[1:02:23] the one doing the healing
[1:02:27] so then put his appearing
[1:02:29] he can be appearing all over the world
[1:02:32] today among the church religion
[1:02:35] religions of the world
[1:02:37] and doing great signs and wonders
[1:02:43] but that's not his coming
[1:02:48] are you getting the difference in the
[1:02:50] two words
[1:02:53] his appearing could be down Through the
[1:02:55] Ages because there was a visibility
[1:02:58] not at the resurrection
[1:03:00] there's to be a visibility in the end
[1:03:02] time
[1:03:06] and he's appearing to the ages
[1:03:10] and sure in a way he was coming to First
[1:03:12] bride because that was his coming is in
[1:03:14] his brightness we'll get that in a
[1:03:16] minute you'll see what I'm talking about
[1:03:19] but there's a difference between his
[1:03:21] appearing in his coming
[1:03:24] how close is it
[1:03:28] when he says he's appearing Among Us
[1:03:31] healing is sick casting out Devils great
[1:03:34] things taking place
[1:03:37] but that's not his coming
[1:03:40] now I didn't say these things and I'm
[1:03:42] just trying to get you to look at a
[1:03:44] point
[1:03:48] so then why would
[1:03:49] walk away to the Lord
[1:03:50] if the appearing of the Lord could be
[1:03:52] signs and wonders
[1:04:01] are you listening
[1:04:05] if appearing is signs and wonders
[1:04:11] what would be his coming
[1:04:17] now remember he's coming that we're
[1:04:19] speaking about is what the prophet said
[1:04:20] he come the first time to redeem is
[1:04:22] right the second time he comes to take
[1:04:26] his bride away
[1:04:29] all right
[1:04:31] so what would be then the difference
[1:04:33] between
[1:04:35] appearing and coming
[1:04:41] as I said then he can appear in any
[1:04:44] church or any position or a situation
[1:04:47] and heal the sick
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:53] I mean if the pope prays for somebody
[1:04:55] they get well are you going to make
[1:04:57] light of that
[1:04:58] you better not you might get the disease
[1:05:01] on you because you remember what the
[1:05:03] Bible says
[1:05:05] when he the Holy Ghost has come
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:11] Jesus said I forgive you son of man I
[1:05:14] forgive you we said we need the Holy
[1:05:16] Ghost has come one word against it don't
[1:05:19] make light of nobody
[1:05:22] you never heard me say Ah that's a bunch
[1:05:25] of old crash over there
[1:05:28] they say yeah but those people healed
[1:05:32] don't tell me that was healed that was
[1:05:34] just some work up
[1:05:36] that's just some thing happened you
[1:05:39] better be careful
[1:05:41] you could open up the Avenue for that
[1:05:44] sickness to come from that person to you
[1:05:46] uh you want the prophet's words
[1:05:49] would not he tell the people to be real
[1:05:51] careful
[1:05:53] in your prayer lines
[1:05:57] all right he said because this sickness
[1:05:59] can come on you
[1:06:03] see because you open the channel to let
[1:06:04] that sickness come to you
[1:06:09] see there's a lot of things in the
[1:06:11] appearing
[1:06:13] that we could spend hours still talking
[1:06:15] about
[1:06:16] but do you get the point
[1:06:18] there's a difference in the appearing
[1:06:21] and the coming of the Lord
[1:06:24] if the appearing can be signs and
[1:06:27] wonders
[1:06:28] what is the coming of the Lord
[1:06:33] but that's all anybody wants
[1:06:40] come on I've had to fight this thing for
[1:06:42] many many years
[1:06:44] of people
[1:06:46] saying well well you don't go to Bert
[1:06:48] Lula if you had what you think of God so
[1:06:51] it could be healed everything be
[1:06:53] happening
[1:06:56] well that's their business you know
[1:06:59] that's your business what you think
[1:07:04] you take your little pity party that
[1:07:06] you're sick
[1:07:08] and you're not believing the word of God
[1:07:11] to deliver you and then blame everybody
[1:07:12] in the church
[1:07:14] it's their problem
[1:07:17] if everybody in the church is Right I'd
[1:07:18] get healed
[1:07:22] might not
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:26] we don't blame everybody else right
[1:07:30] what is the difference in the appearing
[1:07:32] into coming
[1:07:35] no
[1:07:38] I'm going to say it and then try to
[1:07:40] prove it
[1:07:41] Satan can work among the appearing
[1:07:47] but he doesn't know what the coming is
[1:07:54] he's heard it
[1:07:56] but he don't know what it is
[1:07:59] he said well how can he be among the
[1:08:01] Healing Center
[1:08:02] the prophet said he can pass out
[1:08:03] Supernatural gifts now you argue with
[1:08:06] him
[1:08:10] that's not making the devil A Healer
[1:08:15] that's right God does the healing I was
[1:08:17] explaining it a minute ago and you at
[1:08:20] least looked at me
[1:08:22] whether you amend it with a nod or what
[1:08:30] you see Satan can pass out those gifts
[1:08:36] but he's not
[1:08:38] healing nobody
[1:08:41] it ain't one devil going out
[1:08:43] you know
[1:08:44] now that could happen that one devil
[1:08:46] could go out and let another devil come
[1:08:47] in because there's bigger devils
[1:08:50] but
[1:08:53] if a person never healed anywhere
[1:08:56] God had to do it
[1:08:59] right now are we back at the first of
[1:09:00] the message
[1:09:02] then would it be hard to understand that
[1:09:05] he would permit these things to
[1:09:07] transpire
[1:09:10] that even the pope could pray for
[1:09:12] somebody and they'd be healed
[1:09:20] start crying about your gifts
[1:09:24] boy look what we got
[1:09:26] turn on the radio and find out some
[1:09:28] Baptist or something like that got
[1:09:30] greater signs than we have
[1:09:39] are you listening
[1:09:41] what's the difference in appearing in
[1:09:43] the coming
[1:09:47] when Satan can be in on their peering
[1:09:51] and God can even allow those things to
[1:09:54] transpire
[1:09:57] but Satan don't know what his coming is
[1:10:04] what is this coming when we know it's
[1:10:06] not a physical
[1:10:14] you know what I mean it's not a Corporal
[1:10:15] body
[1:10:16] we know better than that
[1:10:19] what is the coming of the Lord
[1:10:22] what do you think of the coming of the
[1:10:25] Lord
[1:10:28] what would be the one thing that Satan
[1:10:31] cannot
[1:10:32] impersonate
[1:10:33] the game
[1:10:39] I know the quote you read it in your
[1:10:41] mind just now
[1:10:42] you can't be the Holy Ghost I agree
[1:10:44] because that's tied up with it you know
[1:10:46] the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of
[1:10:48] the word you agree with that page 45
[1:10:50] Christ of Mystery
[1:10:52] I believe that's right
[1:10:54] he's the only revealer of the word
[1:10:57] so brother random couldn't reveal
[1:10:59] anything to you and I
[1:11:01] Jesus said my own body did not reveal
[1:11:05] that unto thee
[1:11:09] with my father
[1:11:12] see then he's the only revealer of the
[1:11:14] word
[1:11:15] brother Brian revealed to me serpency he
[1:11:18] didn't reveal to you serpent seat
[1:11:23] God has to reveal it to you
[1:11:26] but I got you now brother I got you I
[1:11:28] got to go
[1:11:31] God wrote Moses interpreted
[1:11:35] well show me one Jew is ever saved by
[1:11:37] the interpretation of Moses
[1:11:43] oh
[1:11:47] come on
[1:11:49] show me one Jew is ever saved by the
[1:11:51] interpretation of Moses
[1:11:57] Moses explained in natural words
[1:12:00] what God had written
[1:12:03] in a supernatural language
[1:12:08] but he couldn't make it he couldn't
[1:12:10] reveal it he couldn't make it Leo
[1:12:14] if he did why did he Smite the rock the
[1:12:16] second time
[1:12:19] so you see don't get so much ideas that
[1:12:21] you can quote just remember some of us
[1:12:24] have been around long enough to quote
[1:12:25] with you
[1:12:27] we were life another day about it we was
[1:12:29] in a house one time for a fellowship
[1:12:31] meeting for them to uh change it because
[1:12:34] some of the brothers wanted to go deer
[1:12:35] hunting and it fell on the opening day
[1:12:37] of the the deer season and
[1:12:40] and they wanted to someone wanted to go
[1:12:42] hunting because I never I didn't go
[1:12:44] myself
[1:12:45] so I just asked permission would they
[1:12:47] move it a week
[1:12:48] you know just for allowing
[1:12:51] so we get dire and
[1:12:54] you know
[1:12:55] and there were some brothers that they
[1:12:57] hadn't even been at a meeting at all
[1:13:00] hardly ended all but they jumped onto me
[1:13:03] outside out there
[1:13:08] and they said why is a Rapture took
[1:13:10] place
[1:13:12] well you was gone hunting
[1:13:16] should have been in the fellowship
[1:13:17] meeting
[1:13:21] for the Carnes his brother
[1:13:24] now I'm 99 sure I don't think it was
[1:13:27] it's brother Tom brother Carnes is your
[1:13:29] brother
[1:13:30] he was sitting at a table with him
[1:13:34] and them brothers they was letting me
[1:13:36] have it well see I could have went in
[1:13:37] where the dad and been to the meetings
[1:13:39] or whatever I was just standing there
[1:13:40] grinning
[1:13:42] had a while one of them said
[1:13:45] what if you missed the Rapture going
[1:13:47] hunting
[1:13:50] I said well
[1:13:52] you know there seems to be a little
[1:13:54] quote coming in my mind
[1:13:59] and brother random said
[1:14:02] you remember
[1:14:05] he said I'll meet you on them game
[1:14:06] trails
[1:14:11] oh brother Karns brother he said I told
[1:14:14] you to leave him alone
[1:14:16] I told you he'd have a quote leave him
[1:14:19] alone
[1:14:22] I wasn't trying to be sarcastic I just
[1:14:25] had a decent memory
[1:14:27] but listen folks what is the coming of
[1:14:30] the Lord
[1:14:34] if there's a difference in the appearing
[1:14:36] what is the coming
[1:14:39] what is the thing that Satan cannot
[1:14:42] impersonate when he can impersonate any
[1:14:44] gift
[1:14:50] what is the one thing you can't do
[1:14:55] what is the coming of the Lord to you
[1:14:58] when it's not a physical Corporal body
[1:15:00] of this part
[1:15:02] that we're talking about
[1:15:07] what is it to you
[1:15:12] you'll see why brother Dale's been like
[1:15:14] he's been for
[1:15:15] 45 years
[1:15:18] but I saw this and when I did I said
[1:15:21] Lord
[1:15:23] I'll do my best to explain it
[1:15:28] see the coming of the Lord in this part
[1:15:31] of time where we're at is not a physical
[1:15:33] body
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:36] you agree with that now there's got to
[1:15:38] be something else and it's not just
[1:15:40] signs and wonders
[1:15:42] because Satan can get in onto that
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:47] but you know the one thing that he can't
[1:15:49] do
[1:15:53] he can't bring this word
[1:15:56] word by word
[1:15:59] you need that quote
[1:16:02] he can't bring this word
[1:16:04] word by word
[1:16:08] said they'll take so much of the word
[1:16:10] and make it work
[1:16:13] but they won't take all in the word
[1:16:21] you see today around the world
[1:16:24] there's take Ministries
[1:16:27] people sitting at home listening to
[1:16:29] brother random
[1:16:32] but you know according to the word
[1:16:35] that we've just talked about
[1:16:39] uh brother uh
[1:16:41] don't call his name but brother in this
[1:16:44] message he says so
[1:16:46] you know
[1:16:47] I I read this morning he said it's still
[1:16:50] in the Bible
[1:16:52] you know he give a scripture or
[1:16:54] something that was his point
[1:16:59] say Rebecca probably giggling because
[1:17:00] she knows it was her daddy I said well
[1:17:03] he used to talk he'd say
[1:17:06] I read this morning it is still in the
[1:17:08] Bible
[1:17:10] you know
[1:17:11] well
[1:17:13] you know I've read for a long time
[1:17:17] so then tell me brother that I want you
[1:17:19] believing what you're talking about
[1:17:20] see the coming of the Lord is revealing
[1:17:22] of his word
[1:17:25] that's the one thing Satan came
[1:17:27] impersonate
[1:17:31] he can't impersonate the revealing of
[1:17:33] the word he can't follow it word by word
[1:17:38] he's got to have some
[1:17:40] concept like to Jesus
[1:17:44] you know
[1:17:45] cast yourself down
[1:17:49] angels will bear thee up
[1:17:51] unless you dash your foot
[1:17:53] turn these stones to bread
[1:18:01] see he's always got a carnal
[1:18:05] understanding
[1:18:09] right
[1:18:14] always something carnal
[1:18:18] some way of expressing something some
[1:18:20] way of doing this little carnal state
[1:18:24] that's the way Satan's always been
[1:18:27] well brother Dale I guess in a way
[1:18:31] you could be right
[1:18:34] you remember the mule is the one that
[1:18:36] said in a way you remember that the
[1:18:40] other week it was the mule that said
[1:18:41] that
[1:18:45] he said there's no such thing the
[1:18:47] prophet is in a way it's either right or
[1:18:49] wrong
[1:18:52] you see word that I've stood for 40
[1:18:54] something years
[1:18:56] but I finally had to walk alone
[1:19:02] because of the stand that I take
[1:19:06] I have no problems with that I'm not
[1:19:07] alone I'm not that person you think I am
[1:19:12] I was talking the other day with my wife
[1:19:13] about some situation it breaks my heart
[1:19:17] every day my heart is troubled heavily
[1:19:20] and don't tell nobody don't even tell
[1:19:22] her when I'm troubled
[1:19:26] because of brothers and people that I've
[1:19:28] walked with
[1:19:34] that don't want the word
[1:19:37] yeah up to a certain spot and then stop
[1:19:44] are you calling them the devil well
[1:19:46] brother Brown said
[1:19:48] the devil will take so much of the word
[1:19:51] they said he won't take it word by word
[1:19:54] do you need them quotes
[1:19:57] or do you believe the prophet said it
[1:19:59] that way
[1:20:01] see the only thing that Satan cannot
[1:20:03] impersonate is the opening of the word
[1:20:07] driving
[1:20:09] well now of course here's where we go
[1:20:13] the two Soul people say they got the
[1:20:15] opening of the word
[1:20:18] the seventh anniversary people has got
[1:20:21] the opening of the word
[1:20:23] the perus he is is got the opening of
[1:20:26] the word
[1:20:31] may I say something without you thinking
[1:20:33] too much about it
[1:20:34] but around and said he went to the
[1:20:36] Catholic
[1:20:39] I was a Catholic he said Mom and Daddy
[1:20:42] was
[1:20:43] and he said I went to the
[1:20:45] not get these wrong you put them
[1:20:46] together he went to the Methodist he
[1:20:48] went to the Presbyterian he went
[1:20:51] he said
[1:20:53] one day I just realized
[1:20:57] that it was the word
[1:20:59] he said cause if one of them's right you
[1:21:02] know they're drawn
[1:21:05] so if the two Souls is right the rest of
[1:21:08] the message is wrong
[1:21:11] it's the seventh on diversary people's
[1:21:13] right the rest of the message is wrong
[1:21:16] if the two Lords is right the rest of
[1:21:19] the message is wrong
[1:21:23] if the River Jordan doctrine that Jesus
[1:21:26] wouldn't God until the River Jordan if
[1:21:28] that's right
[1:21:29] then the rest of the message is wrong
[1:21:37] do I need to go back and read where we
[1:21:39] first started
[1:21:44] the people are deceiving the people
[1:21:49] but you know what I love about it too
[1:21:51] because I loved all the word
[1:21:54] he said it must needs to be heresies
[1:21:55] among you
[1:21:58] why
[1:22:03] the Bible tells you why
[1:22:06] it must need to be heresy among you that
[1:22:08] they that are approved may be made
[1:22:12] manifest
[1:22:24] what about it
[1:22:26] what do you think about the coming of
[1:22:28] the Lord
[1:22:30] well it's this is that well anything you
[1:22:34] bring me to talk to me about the coming
[1:22:36] of the Lord has to be any situation
[1:22:41] in the quotes of the Prophet then
[1:22:44] they'll ever one fit one time
[1:22:47] the coming of the Lord is the revealing
[1:22:51] of his word
[1:22:53] because that's the thing Satan cannot
[1:22:55] impersonate
[1:23:02] what do you think about it
[1:23:04] so there is a difference in the
[1:23:05] appearing in the coming
[1:23:10] there is a point that he was visible
[1:23:12] there
[1:23:13] see much in between but then he comes
[1:23:16] down here and be visible again
[1:23:23] but you know somebody who stands on the
[1:23:26] word and tries her best a year after
[1:23:29] year after year is not very popular
[1:23:31] but the people that are predictions and
[1:23:34] run off on this Doctrine and then run
[1:23:36] off on that Doctrine and run off on this
[1:23:38] Doctrine
[1:23:39] I heard a correction on one of the
[1:23:41] points we heard your mom acted
[1:23:44] man wanted a vacation and until he's
[1:23:47] gone two weeks and they said just keep
[1:23:49] on going
[1:23:50] I heard it more straighter than what it
[1:23:52] was
[1:23:53] he went in and told them according to
[1:23:55] the last account that I heard today
[1:23:58] is that he went in and told him he said
[1:24:00] I'm going to take two weeks
[1:24:02] and in two weeks I'll tell you whether
[1:24:04] or not I want to keep following this
[1:24:05] message
[1:24:08] and they said
[1:24:10] he hit the road
[1:24:14] you may not have to come out here and
[1:24:15] tell you until you said sister Gail give
[1:24:17] me a couple of weeks to figure out
[1:24:18] whether I want to believe that Jesus was
[1:24:20] God or not if I ever figure out whether
[1:24:22] it was or not
[1:24:23] I'll preach to you
[1:24:25] you wouldn't want to hear me preach no
[1:24:27] more
[1:24:28] you'd say so long right
[1:24:35] what is the coming of the Lord
[1:24:38] I thought
[1:24:40] the first coming of the Lord
[1:24:44] I thought was
[1:24:46] that the prophets built the body
[1:24:52] which was the word
[1:24:54] and Jesus stepped into that word that
[1:24:56] they brought
[1:24:58] that's what I thought
[1:25:00] gifts and signs and wonders
[1:25:06] yeah quote right around him and I'll
[1:25:08] quit
[1:25:10] he said one day I'll show you where
[1:25:15] those gifts he was used and was not
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:19] that's paraphrasing it right
[1:25:21] do you remember it though
[1:25:25] like the signs are taking about a hand
[1:25:27] and the thing
[1:25:31] it was never supposed to be brought
[1:25:34] because the people were supposed to
[1:25:36] believe the word
[1:25:38] but God knew they couldn't believe it so
[1:25:41] he sent signs
[1:25:44] to try to get the attention
[1:25:47] a sign has never healed nobody
[1:25:51] never saved nobody
[1:25:55] but the Lord come in present
[1:25:58] and how much more today would you want
[1:26:01] of the Lord's coming
[1:26:04] than for him to just keep on opening the
[1:26:08] word
[1:26:11] that you could study it
[1:26:13] and 40 years later you're still
[1:26:17] enjoying it
[1:26:22] 1969 the first message was what
[1:26:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:27] will be the son of man
[1:26:30] made manifest on Earth
[1:26:33] that's the first sermon I preached
[1:26:38] you see that's why this little is just
[1:26:40] built on one time
[1:26:42] word words word
[1:26:44] that's all I can do
[1:26:48] but any sign of Satan can impersonate
[1:26:51] any guilt he can impersonate
[1:26:55] but that don't leave us without gifts
[1:26:59] that don't mean I don't believe in gifts
[1:27:03] I'm a firm believer in gifts
[1:27:07] but as long as they're lined up with the
[1:27:09] word
[1:27:14] you remember the man that come to
[1:27:16] brother random and said I want to
[1:27:17] straighten you out on that marriage and
[1:27:18] divorce around them
[1:27:22] he said I had a vision he said
[1:27:24] immediately I saw he had a dream but you
[1:27:26] know he still let that go
[1:27:31] when a man got to explaining all the
[1:27:34] lovely things he said yes
[1:27:37] sounds good but said it don't fit the
[1:27:39] word
[1:27:42] right
[1:27:43] come on musicians
[1:27:46] he said it don't fit the word
[1:27:51] well you gotta have the word for
[1:27:53] everything
[1:27:56] I hope so
[1:28:03] go to the knots you'll run after some
[1:28:04] strange Doctrine
[1:28:07] at some point or something
[1:28:12] and you will say oh I must be right
[1:28:15] look at what's taking place
[1:28:18] now if you want to call this a prophecy
[1:28:20] or whatever it is whatever you want to
[1:28:22] do
[1:28:23] 40 something years ago
[1:28:25] I stood in this pulpit and I said
[1:28:29] it'll come a time
[1:28:30] when the Baptists and Methodist
[1:28:32] Presbyterian Pentecostals Etc
[1:28:36] will be having signs and wonders
[1:28:38] in their churches
[1:28:40] and they'll say look
[1:28:43] we must be right because look at the
[1:28:46] things that are transpiring
[1:28:49] is it right around the world today
[1:28:54] what are you going to do if some of
[1:28:55] these
[1:28:57] doctrinal people that you know have been
[1:28:59] in die-highed into two Souls of the
[1:29:03] other virtues and things and signs and
[1:29:05] wonders starts falling
[1:29:08] what are you gonna do
[1:29:14] random said I don't care
[1:29:19] what takes place
[1:29:22] and we're perforation it signs and
[1:29:24] wonders he said but if they stay with
[1:29:26] the same old simple message
[1:29:31] he said get away from it
[1:29:34] is that a quote
[1:29:38] so we're supposed to be worried oriented
[1:29:40] people that's what I thought
[1:29:44] that's what I've always thought
[1:29:47] you know what else was we supposed to be
[1:29:50] yeah but signs and wonders what I'm
[1:29:53] building
[1:29:54] signs follow them that believe Believers
[1:29:56] don't follow signs
[1:30:03] signs
[1:30:06] and wonders
[1:30:08] now what did your Prophet say
[1:30:11] the brother was quoting it last night
[1:30:17] may I quote it and I said no let me
[1:30:18] quote the other but Iran says
[1:30:22] these
[1:30:24] virtues without the Holy Ghost
[1:30:27] is a stumbling block
[1:30:30] you see well he didn't say that now let
[1:30:32] me put it the way he said it he said to
[1:30:34] gifts without the virtues
[1:30:40] that's what I'm saying
[1:30:42] the gifts were not the virtues as a
[1:30:44] stumbling block
[1:30:48] power without character the brothers
[1:30:50] quoting line is what satanic
[1:30:56] I like the way he said it
[1:30:58] I can't even I say satanic he said
[1:31:00] santatic
[1:31:02] I thought that's the best way to say it
[1:31:04] I guess
[1:31:06] but what do you think about it there's a
[1:31:08] difference in the appearing of the Lord
[1:31:10] and the coming of the Lord
[1:31:14] I want the thing that Satan came
[1:31:16] impersonate
[1:31:20] don't let me hold on to that what we got
[1:31:26] 27 in this fire book anybody have a need
[1:31:47] what about the word
[1:31:51] remember the old colored brother
[1:31:55] I'd rather be standing on the word
[1:31:59] standing in heaven
[1:32:04] why would you say that
[1:32:07] he said calls the book says Heaven and
[1:32:10] Earth will pass away but my word will
[1:32:14] never pass your way
[1:32:36] my brother's concerned about his wife
[1:32:39] and the most biggest concern about
[1:32:41] yourself
[1:32:42] so we just ask you Lord to let him
[1:32:46] come to a place to see
[1:32:49] where he's supposed to be
[1:32:59] we want to see her father
[1:33:01] we love you father when we thank you
[1:33:05] Jesus name
[1:33:09] come and let's see
[1:33:23] got a problem on one of us
[1:33:26] and let's just pray that it'll be taken
[1:33:29] away all right Lord Jesus
[1:33:33] we thank you for your word it said by
[1:33:35] your stripes we're healed
[1:33:37] the Levy's got a problem with one of her
[1:33:39] feet the orders it's giving her hurting
[1:33:41] her little knot that's on her things we
[1:33:45] ask you Lord to just take it away let
[1:33:48] your love be made manifest really in
[1:33:51] Jesus name
[1:33:57] asking yourself
[1:34:06] let's give him a prayer cloth and pray
[1:34:10] that the Lord would bless him
[1:34:12] let everything work out
[1:34:15] you know for the Lord's honor and glory
[1:34:18] honor in the name of Jesus Christ May
[1:34:21] everything be all right our brother will
[1:34:23] go and everything will work out all the
[1:34:25] work the job the things everything will
[1:34:28] fall right in line because we believe in
[1:34:31] Jesus name
[1:34:38] what about it
[1:34:40] the coming of the Lord
[1:34:45] revealing of this word
[1:34:50] God is not a physical
[1:34:53] born
[1:34:55] coming inside of us
[1:35:00] the growth development of the word
[1:35:03] because Peter says being born again
[1:35:09] growing in the word
[1:35:17] anybody up before we go
[1:35:22] please
[1:35:23] Jesus
[1:35:39] then we shall be
[1:35:46] thank you
[1:36:16] mother you heard our sister she doesn't
[1:36:19] even know how to pray hear what to ask
[1:36:21] for but she just wants to ask for you to
[1:36:24] take over and you do what would be
[1:36:27] needful in her heart and her life to her
[1:36:30] that you can have the preeminence we
[1:36:33] love you father we thank you in Jesus
[1:36:35] name
[1:36:38] do you believe it
[1:36:40] anybody else
[1:36:44] wow
[1:36:56] see we don't take all the words
[1:37:04] we take what we want
[1:37:07] I remember some brothers years ago they
[1:37:09] emphasized heavily over and over and
[1:37:11] over
[1:37:13] and you'd walk up to them and to ask
[1:37:15] them to be you know to pray for you
[1:37:17] they'd say you've been to the doctor
[1:37:20] because there's a quote around him says
[1:37:22] you got no right to go before God till
[1:37:24] you went to the doctor
[1:37:27] but that didn't mean you didn't pray for
[1:37:29] people and
[1:37:33] it just means go to the doctor
[1:37:37] go to the doctor and he went in South
[1:37:41] but see there was a point made to
[1:37:43] emphasize something
[1:37:45] you don't have to go to the doctor
[1:37:47] you're standing right here and believe
[1:37:52] what's wrong with going to the doctor
[1:37:55] well at the end of my faith well you
[1:37:57] don't have any
[1:38:02] plain enough
[1:38:04] you got faith
[1:38:06] you mean Abraham every day said
[1:38:09] I better not go by that doctor's office
[1:38:12] I'm going way around
[1:38:15] because I'm about to pick up some Spirit
[1:38:17] it would make me doubt God was going to
[1:38:20] give me that baby
[1:38:27] I wouldn't care if brother Reynolds said
[1:38:29] it
[1:38:30] I wouldn't care if he said Abraham went
[1:38:32] to the doctor every day and had a test
[1:38:34] to see where where he was capable of
[1:38:36] having children it wouldn't bother me
[1:38:38] foreign
[1:38:59] we've seen these prayer claws go out to
[1:39:02] many people around the world
[1:39:04] I'm seeing God deliver well why can't we
