then brother Hank has a word for this testimony he wants to thank the people but if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Hebrews 11 and we will begin reading um verse 39 and 40. and then we will go to chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 and maybe we will begin to get into that point but we want to talk a little bit about the things you know that has been made known to us in this last days that we thank God for Heavenly Father we thank you for all of the day and the love and the all things we pray that you would just bless us now as we meditate upon you that as we lord speak about you then you come on the scene Lord and and make yourself known because that's our desire in our hearts first off forgive our sins to where that we can all stand completing you and then direct us in your loving grace bless all of the visitors with us today and may you open our eyes as we sang unto you of understanding that we may be able to hear from you and Lord just teach us and help us and guide us remember the sick among us because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you we thank you in Jesus name amen let's just read the scripture and yeah verse 39 Hebrews 11. and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise no nail it into your heart and your mind in your reading they didn't receive the promise what is it they didn't receive all right God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now that's not trying to raise them up and make Perfection that means to be complete a full age full-grown whatever uh it's not that we're going to raise the dead and then we're going to make them perfect that's not the way it is something has to happen for them to be come to full age or full or to the fullness of what they were starting out to be all right then verse 30 verse 1 of chapter 12 wherefore are therefore see change that word to therefore it'll help you to understand therefore seeing we also are compassioned about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing brother Hank had a word he wants to thank the church and offer Anthony come on you know first I'd like to thank all y'all for helping me and my wife Martha's doing good oh and I want to ask the church to forgive me I'm I made a lot of mistakes and all y'all helped me a lot and I don't want to let y'all down Brother Martin Donnie has went out on the limb for me many times so far I don't want to ask y'all to forgive me for any mistakes I've made y'all please forgive me uh I won't ask you to forgive me too for not being here when I should be here you've been good to me and I thank you the church has been good to me and my wife and I love y'all and I thank y'all Amen in Jesus name amen thank you amen amen now we've been quite a while in a series to the visitors we won't try to leave you behind and you know without knowing what we've been trying to do um we've been reading and studying in the chat Hebrews 11th chapter of all of these great warriors of faith all right and they all now we've been over and over it you'll find in verse 2 that they obtained a good report through faith all right now then you keep reading a little bit and you find over in verse 13. these all died in faith having see not having received the promises all right then we read here in Hebrews the 11 39 that all of these haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise all right and then he concludes it by going into verse 40 and says God having provided some better thing for us me that they without us should not be made perfect all right now I've tried to make a point to you to to illustrate it uh why would Paul spend the whole chapter talking of the great warriors of faith that these things happen you know stop them out of line say uh you know Enoch and Noah and uh Abel and the great Abraham and the great Moses and each one of those talking about that they did obtain in their day what God spoke of amen all right they did achieve those things by faith or through faith every which way you you're transport you know putting it all right and then why would Paul say that after they had done what God ordained for them to do in each age as they were living but he would say that they never received the promise all right now he left that at a point to to for us to think about I believe that you know they did achieve what was they were told everybody understanding they done those things but why would the Apostle Paul as we know as he was writing of the great obituaries of each one of these and and you know telling that and not not telling all of the things I like the way the prophet said it one day he said look at it like this he said dire Abraham lied give his wife away and everything else which said when God wrote his obituary over in Hebrews 11 said he never mentioned that why because God was not looking at what was going on he was looking at what he promised to do and that he would take care of things all right then in doing that then we know that there's a set and I keep repeating because I want that in your mind so when when we say something in a second it won't flip back and what is he talking about see and just keep it in your mind to one thing they did achieve what God said they would do all right but evidently they were something liking what's a better word for it I don't have that much education but you know something that was never fully achieved let's put it that away maybe by them all right and uh then he turned around and he says all right now they didn't get it they never received a promise and he calls it promises during one of them and he concludes it by you know I like the way Paul does Paul will lay down a great story a great thing and get everything lined up real good to where that he has the entire Bible behind him as a background and then all at once he'll just lay something on you as we call it and he'll say something that is outstanding all right so he does here he said something really outstanding God provide having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect all right as I said a moment ago we know that we're not going to wait to one of these days and the Dead's going to raise and we're going to preach some message to these Old Testament Saints because that is the Old Testament Saints there is not a listing in the Hebrews 11 of the New Testament group this is the Old Testament Saints all right now brother Branham did use it on the Statue of a perfect man to relate down to the ages and we know that they down to the ages see there is something there and that's what we've tried to speak about and using what they were back there now what was it they never attained into all right now the Old Testament Saints never attained unto eternal life in their soul because that was withholding from them all right then Jesus saying come unto me all ye that are labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest all right now Hebrews Paul covers it then later he's talking about they didn't enter into the rest you remember that in the scripture all right they never entered into the rest that was spoken of they rejected that we call it rejecting the right of sonship or are the children of God and and rejecting those things because it was for them we Gentiles had no promises we had a few types and shadows laying throughout the word but no great promises to us Gentiles it was really built to the Jews the oracles or the law came to the Jews adoption Paul said pertain to the Jews all of these things was pertaining to the Israelites or the Jews as we call it we know all Israel is not Israel all Jews are okay but the point I've been trying to make is that why would then he say that they without us should not be made perfect so there's a connecting some way to you and I or else Paul is um Rome because he's saying it himself he's making the connection and he says then that without us they cannot be made perfect look that word perfect up it's not talking about sinless perfection uh stuff like that or some way you could raise them and preach something to them that would make them perfect no it's not speaking that away it's speaking of completeness or full grown where it says in Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that's not talking about sinless perfection that's talking about full grown all right maturity or are accomplishing what you were really set out to be you know Israel was set out to be the people of God right he came to his own his own received him not but as many as received him gave you what power to become the sons of God right but to Israel as a whole rejected salvation all right now maybe you don't follow me and I'm audience speaking but I just say what I believe all right see then when the Old Testament people turned down the right of sonship and killed a messiah see then he could turn to the Gentiles which word Gentiles means Nations so the biggest portion of the early church was even until the first church age was almost all Jews and things but it Gentiles it just means Nations you know a kingdom was coming to the Nations Paul spoke of it in his writings you know the great mystery that the coming in of the Gentiles all right which means Nation see a Jew can be in this nation this is any Nation anybody can be uh Born Again In This Kingdom that is here because but it's just listed as Gentile all right then in doing it see then he says that there won't be made perfect they won't be complete without us now I asked this simple question because I'm simple-minded all right what would have happened had Israel and we know they didn't know They didn't accept Jesus Christ when he came right few of the people in there accepted him but as a whole they did not accept him all right so we know that they did not accept eternal life now what would have happened had it went on without God coming in to make something uh to work out so he turns to the Gentiles and the Gentiles accept salvation and you realize by us accepting salvation then the Jews would not be obliterated from the Earth is that Paul in the Romans that we better not glory in our own selves we glory in The Roots which Our Roots are Jewish all right you might not like no connection to him but there's one thing about it they the gospel came from them to us all right and if it hadn't been for them turning it down and Paul said God blinded them but he said one day then all Israel will be saved all right we know there is a a group of people back there that I hope you don't misunderstand me in saying it those people of the Old Testament never received eternal life because the Bible said Jesus Christ had not been glorified all right how could they receive eternal life in their soul they would have to go to paradise and wait all right they would have to have a place to wait because they could not step forth themselves because they did not have any way of receiving eternal life into their soul that would require Jesus Christ dying on the cross God himself climbing up on the tree dying to release the life that was within him and that that life that was in him would be able to come back upon the believer to give us a new birth all right that was what Israel rejected but my point has been on one thing what if we hadn't accepted it it would have ended everything but the fact that we did accept it you see where it puts the connection to Israel that they cannot come to the place that was even ordained for them to be they cannot come there without you and I why because we've got to come forth in this days to the Gentiles and we got some things that's got to take place and that without us you'll see they couldn't be made perfect all right quick run through in the church ages they did receive eternal life on the death Pentecost hch had the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost in every Age The Prophet said all right but then they would be connected waiting on you and I that's right we'll read it in a second we're they're waiting on you and I see because they cannot come to their completeness now Israel couldn't come to eternal life because they turned it down right all right down to the ages those people could not come to eternal life and flesh not if they turned it down it's because it was withholding Paul would prophesy of it you know change in a moment a twinkle of an eye strong you know Trump is your sound Etc see it was sealed up just as the Gentiles coming into to be part of of to be the bride of Christ was sealed up in the scriptures in a mystery until it was brought forth amen all right so is it a mystery that somebody's going to be changed well all right those waiting in the grave there's no way for them to come back because according to my Bible it says the dead in Christ shall rise first all right so they have a resurrection right they died in the resurrection they're sealed in the resurrection all right but said the dead in Christ shall rifle and we which are alive and remain is going to be changed all right so then a lot of people's trying to find a Rapture are called away you better be kind to find a resurrection all right that's just a point you want to find a Rapture oh we want to go into rapture I've got one I hope I can find it right around them said it and I was in the office I'm sure he said this man was talking about going to heaven and he said he was talking about how that he was loading up to go to heaven he said I'm not loading up to go to heaven you remember what he said he said I'm unloading that's different ain't it that's different from anything we ever thought of yeah he said I'm unloading I'm getting rid of all of these things that bind me here the word that I can go to heaven I told you 20 years ago I said I quit trying to go to heaven why because I realized heaven's got to come here to take me there that's explained right all right then in doing that then those New Testament Saints there have no connection to their glorified body outside of you see you've got to pull them out the dead has got to be raised something's got to cause it well there's many philosophies among the message people but you know it's all right you believe what you want to believe whatever what it is irregardless of what your philosophy is it better be connected to a resurrection because that is the next thing it is not the Rapture the Resurrection comes then you can talk about a rapture all right because that's that would be scriptural all right so then that would put the Old Testament people dependent upon you and I because we did accept the Salvation And by us accepting it God simply blinding his people for you and I amen you know the Bible says one day their eyes will be opened all right we know that there'll be a group called 144 000 that will be sealed in the Kingdom but we also know the mystery that we didn't know about until the prophet came to tell us about it call the fifth seal Jew and that field sealed you is Israel that one day will receive eternal life all right so then there's a connection to them but there's a connection to the ride down through the ages of this end time that they're waiting on you and I am all right they're waiting on you and I yeah but here's where we go but I just don't see nothing going on that's the way people talk well we used to have a lot of things a long time ago but everything's kind of died down now and we're just waiting on a bus to pull up right I mean is that what you're doing a time to run out a president to be come out of a woman to be president or a pope to come out of the United States or uh no that's what's been preached 40 50 years ain't it some kind of something that everybody's waiting on you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on you and if I die I'll be dependent upon you right to Simply become what the Bible says you are to be to recognize your day in this message all right we take that and we say we recognize our day in this message brought around with the prophet brought around the prophet amen wonderful but what about your message and I've told the church here over and over the Catholic church was never got excited when Martin Luther nailed his thesis to the door he didn't bother them you said well they did no I didn't it was when the people begin to Rally around behind Martin Luther the Catholic Church got excited they wasn't excited because that he was protesting them they'd had protest many before then she's the people right amen when the children of Israel was down in Egypt they were they had to rally around the message of their day yeah the Moses but you know what Moses never took him in the promised land so that evidently wasn't God's full plan Joshua took him in all right so there's more to the story than just waiting on Moses all right then here we are in the end time looking back and seeing that everything before us and everything after us is waiting on you and I well we're not important you know we just don't know who we are all right I've made this statement probably ten times I'll make it one more everybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything was a people or a person who realized who they were and what they were doing right when they realized when Moses his mama told him who he was he knew for 40 years who he was five minutes at the burning bush sent him back to Egypt to take over why because he realized who he was his mama told him who his was right but that didn't do any good that made him a coward in a running and killing an Egyptian huh for five minutes of the burning bush it sent him back to Egypt to take over which you know Moses wouldn't the one that was to come out of Egypt he could go in and out anytime he desired to it was the children of Israel now here's the words of the Prophet right he said when Israel began to cry out for a deliverer God met that in the person of Moses to bring them out all right so in the end time when the people begin to cry out yes instead of quitting crying like babies oh we don't have nothing when we was back in the old days may I quote brother random I keep this tape in the it's in the church age and I keep it in my truck and play it every time I'm out in a truck brother random says no believer needs to say that if I was back there what he said that's right he said cause he's the same yesterday today and forever all right he's the same so then why cry out oh if we're just back there when the prophet was here did God leave when the prophet left come on church it's not throwing off on anybody's ideas and opinions it's just telling the God's honest truth realizing then that everybody's waiting on you and I am let's just read a couple of quotes let's go with number seven brother I told him I said I'm going to jump so follow me numbers okay that means I left them a number on the side of my notes and they're supposed to put that up on the screen all right from the message what was the Holy Ghost given for preached in 1958-59 excuse me 12 17. look what your Prophet says you read all the way up and down I'll give you the whole quote all right but now when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he's pouring in his Spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you oh he's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you right those in the grave before us are waiting on you and I know right adoption time look when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into rapture so everything is waiting on you and I now I'm going to be blunt because that way I can't be misunderstood from blood the people of this message are the most laziest shiftless bombs that have ever been in any age because they got their own little concept of what it is and their own little book of rules and her own little set and they're sitting down waiting and a lot of them ain't waiting on brother Brown to raise may I say it without getting offensive a lot I've been waiting on Joe Coleman to raise gonna name a lot more what about it do you understand what I'm saying the people have just sat down and died in the message well ain't no revival going on I've been in a Revival ever since I first heard of this prophet's message and if you can't say that you need to get in the Altar and get born again you mean that you've heard the greatest thing that all the world has been waiting on all those back there everybody down through that's right is waiting and depending upon you you know the Jews will have the Millennium do you know that the prophet said that then the Millennium will be to the Jews right that's when they all come back in and different things happen well you know what they're they're going to be way on pies to it which you know what they're not going to get it unless we get it that's my point that's what I drove at for months and months what is the thing that they never achieved but yet they they achieved all of the great wonderful things in their time they never achieved a change in the body they never achieved eternal life which you and I are going to do it why because the Bible said it all right now I got a choice I can be an us or they yeah right I can say that the world is waiting on us are they waiting on somebody else because that's what Hebrews says so I can change myself and to say well and come on folks now most of you know it I'm playing 40 years ago almost I said the biggest portion of the people of this message will die and go by the grave I will not back off on that statement not because of old age a lot of young people in this message are dying but you know why because if I can't come to a place to be changing among the twinkling of an I I've got to go by the grave and so have you until now it's my choice but we're in a silly day right you know there's nobody in here knows for sure who you are I'm talking about physically come on physically what do you mean I'm Mark action Roth no you might be Mark McGillicuddy come on I'm playing you say but no my Mom and Daddy was pure might have been but you don't know so you don't know who you are so then somebody comes along one day and passes that paperwork and they say look you might not be Wade Dale you might be Jim Jones or George Jones okay we'll put George in there and he'll say I'm 50 something years old and I've been a Dale all these years and I'm going to stay a Dale because I know who I am I'm Samuel weight Dale II okay Mr Dale but said now what we've got is we found some paperwork connected to this Jones that went in George Jones that would entitle you to his inheritance according to that we got about two billion dollars it belongs to ever who this is yeah hands are going up I'm George Jones okay illustration you'll never forget an illustration all right what's my point if you change for two billion dollars from who you really are then you've got a problem you don't know who you are I don't care what they can prove I know who raised me I didn't know my dad he died when I was about four years old but my mom worked on a farm digging and doing and working in raised nine kids and I'm the baby you think 10 billion dollars would make me change my name you are messed up in your brain because love is more than 10 billion dollars I love the one who brought me into the world people today want I want to know who I am I want to find out who I am I might be a Jones you said what's your point my point is one thing those in the Bible that ever amounted to anything was people that knew who they were whether that be old or new testament with people who knew who they were and I knew that the Bible said it is he hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and sheep of his pastor I know who my father really is how about you see ever since I heard about that when the prophet began to talk about it I told you before I've had experiences I've had things happen but when that Prophet began to talk about a personal relationship between you and God with a real God there was not a man or mythology mythologies are a thought spiritual something that he was a being a person amen amen you see right then I began to say wait just a minute if he's that and I'm supposed to be his child who am I what are you trying to say when the end time people finds out who they are right is that true go to number number five brother we got it somewhere on here okay go to number five which is a revelation of Jesus Christ start taken from the church age book page 15. and watch Satan fights the truth he fights the word the people trying to destroy the people trying to destroy the word if he destroys the word he destroys the people so look what he said he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her just like he was before Jesus Christ believe that or is that just a good quote or of course a lot of people don't believe it cause come out of the church age book you know that Doctrine right all right well look what he says what she stands for and that she can do the greater nobody can do Greater Works it's only him we've got to figure out what's being talked about it's nobody can do Greater Works you know the message you know what the prophet said it means more instead of course nothing can be greater than him Watch what it is what is that that he's talking about down here what is that two spirits that's in the framework of the church one of them's the Holy Spirit watch the other one has to be the devil right because there's only two spirits so the devil's trying his best to discourage you to keep you from realizing who you are to try to in perfect words to you to make you where you won't believe that you can do the Greater Works right but I just don't see nothing going on will open your eyes we have seen the dead raised in this church some are setting here that we're not be here if it hasn't been for that but yeah of course nobody alone well we don't know whatever go ahead that's all right no problem but you know what we just read from what was the Holy Ghost given for he said God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you look what he says go to number six brother Revelation book of symbols 56 6 17. let's just read this one roll it up a little bit where look what he says keep holding on don't worry God is waiting you mean God is waiting we just read that God was waiting on you and I we just read the churches waiting on you and I what about it God is waiting and trying pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's the holding back the coming of Christ now and the great Millennium is this great Supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church well you mean your star look how simple he makes it go to number eight we have seen his star and have come to worship paragraph 147. and there's a word prophesied for this day God is waiting to find somebody it's not too unusual to that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and be a Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the unbeliever that blaspheme it won't bring Justice upon them but he said it's not unusual when something is Not Unusual it means that it is simply usual which means that it can be brought into being all right when we believe it so it's based on you and I thank you it's based on what we can believe well brother if we could just find what is for us in the end time okay why don't you read The Prophet's message the whole message is what did he say he said this Prophet would be pointing to the sky now could complete the rest of that to the word born bride yes maybe two a word one right if you're going to be so technical you mean the whole world is waiting on you and I evidently must be go watch it wait no well got to be a president I've got to be a woman president got to be a pope out of the United States those things will happen I believe they can happen and I believe they've already happened oh let's talk about the Moon turning to blood and the blood moons and all this that and the other you know what your Prophet said back in the 50s he said I can show you where that's already took place I don't know that I ever found where he told what it was but he said it did and I believe I believe but don't you because he said it happened I wasn't there when he spoke squirrels into existence but I believe it you know why I believe it because I've seen in my own life God come on the scene the man died right in front of Wade and I his eyes rolled back wait said daddy he's dead I looked down at him I said random he just raised his eyes up looked around I said what you see I've had experiences with that God and I know he's real so that way I can know what he's waiting on he's waiting on somebody that will take the message and coil to the coming of the Lord The Whole World's waiting on it somebody to do it somebody to step out well do you see what they're doing they're waiting on you and I adoption time when God can pour in his fullness Etc it's all in him you know because we don't give no honor to man nowhere I honored the prophet because he brought a message but that was the word he brought is my honor that's what I honor I honor the ministry that brings the word to me I honor that honor the brothers and sisters that are really trying to serve God I honor those things but not people God none of us are worth anything I don't care how glorified You Think You Are you're worth about enough a nickel to sprinkle the hens Nest the prophet said worth a dust but you see when it's all finished it's going to be finished by somebody that believes God well I can't I contend that I believe him well this afternoon we get to it Lord willing we'll find out what's the worst sin of all what's the worst sin you can think of all right but think about it they're waiting on you and I so that means not watch the point we're going to get to the scripture just for a minute and then we'll quit everything before us is dependent upon us everything after us is dependent upon us I know it has been preached and I've heard it I'm not going to argue with nobody about it but I've heard it preached at the Old Testament Saints raised with Jesus Christ and went into immortality now I can't believe that because the Bible says that no man had a personal immortality with Jesus Christ all right I don't believe that all right then that would put not them waiting on us it'd be with us following them somewhere all right and that would put you in a little wrong category all right I believe Those Old Testament Saints are waiting on you and I I believe the bride that has died down through ages is waiting on you and I now let's see if you swallow I believe that the 144 000 that is to come after us is dependent upon whether or not we can achieve what is said here today yeah because if it's not done they won't have anything your Prophet said those two witnesses Church civil right off the back of the seventh seal he said they will tell them about us what do you think they're going to go with to Israel with they're going to go there as living God in them two witnesses and declare that the Gentiles has become what they're supposed to do and when there's 144 000 see it that way they cry and pull to themselves because they know they rejected sonship and they know that they'll only be servants is that right to the bride but you know there's a sealed Jew part that goes in there you know there's a group of people calling foolish virgins that will receive it at the white Throne judgment right well you know what if it don't come here and we walk off this Earth in a change of the body there's not going to be anything for them you believe I can prove that with the Bible if I can prove it with the Bible then you'll listen to it of course you get your smirky works and words and things of what you think it is but listen you explain it to me how that anybody else if those Old Testament Saints raised they went into immortality into the presence of almighty God and you show me that in the Bible when wrote around him went beyond a curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus he said he's a step higher nobody can go there right that's immortality Those Old Testament Saints raised into eternity yes I know the quotes of the Prophet I know what he's taught but you don't listen to the other things he taught like he said in the Rapture one day the resurrection Will Come Those Old Testament Saints will come forth and he said we will fall right in line now you're arguing with quotes not me because remember he said falling in line that doesn't mean everything's in order when you say falling in line that means you fall in line where you go you realize when we walk off this Earth the field seals you hasn't got their message yet the 144 000 hasn't got their message yet come on they haven't got it yet so that means as far that away and it's far that away right is dependent upon you and I oh no brother Dale I'm dependent upon Jesus Christ oh I'm glad you're so revelated because that's what I've taught I've preached for 50 years is the Bride of Jesus Christ is God made manifest in another form called a bride Joe and I said that he's waiting on you and I he's waiting on God to manifest himself in you and I to raise the dead he said become visible Among Us right okay Brothers pull up Hebrews 12. 1 and we'll take just a minute then I'll back up this evening Hebrews 12 1. wherefore seeing we are compassioned about with so great a cloud Witnesses let us lay aside ever wait the sin that does so easily beset us let us run with patience to race it is set before us looking unto Jesus now we're not looking at anything else come on all right what does that mean we're foreseeing now he finished he finished chapter 12. 11 by saying that they without us could not be made perfect you know the Bible is not written in chapters right we put them in right it would just come right on down through so now look after all of what you see in chapter 11. chapter 12 makes an outstanding statement what wherefore or therefore seeing we also are compassioned about so great a cloud of witnesses compassion about with a great cloud of witnesses we are compassionate about with a great cloud of witnesses everything before us spoke of us no now it's folkat Jesus get that out of your carnal mind and listen sensibly there is no bride without Christ but he without us brother Reynolds said can't be made complete you want that quote you need that quote he said without us he can't be made complete he said to godhead's not complete without us that's a direct quote now or just do what you want to see it's not you and I it's crafting you because it wasn't crying it wasn't Moses it was Christ in Moses right it wasn't Elijah it was Christ in Elijah it was Christ in all of those Old Testament Saints amen right amen it was Christ in Paul it was Christ in all of them coming down through the New Testament so they went without us cannot be made perfect and seeing that point therefore as I said you say wherefore just read You original it says therefore wherefore and therefore interchangeable we're compact with a great cloud of witnesses you know my mind runs back to a time that Elijah was there and Emerald gehaza he went out and looked one day and man they were just syrians there what they were they were just everywhere and he runs against Elijah he said evidently looking for you oh Elijah just walked out to her and he looks and he said Lord would you open the servant's eyes now what did he see when he opened his eyes a great cloud of witnesses Chariots of Fire horses of fire rung around the prophet right you think Elijah was afraid I think of another time when it says that when you see Jerusalem compassed go look your Redemption drawing now is that right compassed your Redemption drawth now if you can't look over there right now and take a map and look and see we're here Russia's here China's here and all these others are over here Jerusalem is compassioned about on every side a little bitty small country bringing the whole world to a war and we're there just as much as they are because we need what they got to you don't read you know that we went into Kuwait why did we go into Kuwait when the other countries was a problem we went into Kuwait you know why finally one man printed something one day and I started laughing I thought why didn't he put that out a whole lot you know what he said he said he said we went into Kuwait now this is an article in a newspaper he said because 50 years from now we'll need that part of the country to bring the oil down through so we went to Kuwait you mean the towers went down that was fulfillment of scriptures right and we declared war on Iraq or what it is and which one we declared war on and all about 90 percent of those people that was on those planes that took them down come from Syria why didn't we declare war on them say you don't read you're only wanting to know about it woman being president maybe it's failing maybe it's just maybe it's Clinton I always say put both of men together and give them double presidency if that's going to take the if that's what it's going to take to get me and you out of here put every woman in the White House I want to get out of here don't you come on folks you can live all you want to but some of you are getting old I'm 74 and I'm looking down on people that are some of them in that age and some older you know what if something don't happen pretty quick unlike brother Carol said somebody said something about the you know the coming at a certain time he said well if he don't hurry up I'm going one way or the other that's a good point either that's going to get me there the devil is going to get me or something's going to get me would you think about compassed do you know what word Compass means it means to be hanged because you can pass something it means to be bound with to be compassed with be compassed about means to lie around you know and be compassed with have round one you know so if we're compassion with a greater cloud of witnesses see that's all before us and all after us I've made clear of what I've said today they will be people receive eternal life when we get out of here but it'll be because that God gave us the eternal life and you read Paul in there where he's talking about the grace that I was talking about the other the grace if you don't have Grace for somebody else then you're not born again forget it would you die to give this message to someone else Paul said he would compass for about a great cloud of witnesses all right seeing that we're compassioned with such a great cloud of witnessing blessed unless I'd ever sin and ever since awake this is taken from number one brother show us the father and it suffice us we're running a race now with patients looking to the author looking back there how they was tormented and made fun of is called and sought us under and wondered about his sheepskin and goat skin in deserts and destitute and afflicted in my and the Bible said of whom the world's not even worthy of such a people all of those but they're what they're the great cloud of witnesses the queen of the South number two seeing that we're compassed about the greater cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight of sin that does so easily be set us Hebrews the 12th chapter speaking on the speaking of the 11th where the great Witnesses was done the supernatural was performed and Paul's saying see that we're compassed with that type of witnesses let us leicest side ever sin what what is sin unbelief what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith all the great Heroes of Faith in saying seeing that we're compassionate about with such a greater cloud of witness let us lay aside ever wait and to sin that sin the unbelief that does so easily besetters here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and yet we find the church in anemic condition if you want your Prophet is saying we ought to be the great strong Mighty Warriors of faith that would shake a nation God gives it to us we would we would just receive it so there's little things upon us that holds us back from running let us let us out all those little ways now because we're looking to the author and finish of our faith Jesus Christ looking to lies for and when we see that out to attract the attention it ought to attract the attention of every man and woman to lay aside every little skeptic well I love that lay aside ever wait and little unbelief that says so easily beset us some little something come up and we say well I never heard that before search it out in the scriptures if it's a Bible stay with it but I never heard that before some little something he says we'll pick up that this evening but I won't read one more scripture I guess they can pick it up I don't think I put it in Brothers turn over to Hebrews 11. and we'll start reading in verse 20. 2 while they're getting there to bring it up says we're not coming to Mount Sinai coming to the mount that might be touched and that burn with fire nor into Blackness and darkness are the trumpets of things with Moses watch but we are come unto verse 20. 20. 2 3 excuse me let me get it from my reading all right but we are come unto Mount sign and into the city of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels you think they was gathered around Elijah 11 22. I mean 12 22. and to the general assembly who is that and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God to judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of Franklin that speaketh better things than that of Abel sounds like that we're gathered by a great cloud of witnesses you know what now I'm going to finish it come on musicians by saying it this way Those Old Testament Saints attained to what God said they would do you agree the bride down Through the Ages under Paul Peter James John Luther Wesley Etc even Pentecost they attained unto the place that God had ordained for them to be because the prophet said there was a word ordained for every age and somebody to make it live all right then one of these days when we get out of here there'll be 144 000 Jews except Jesus Christ they will be uh fulfilled you that your Prophet says will be in the millennium they will be a foolish virgin given eternal life and we're compassionate about all of those things all before us all after us well I never heard it like that because I always thought it was dependent upon Jesus I pray to God you don't misunderstand it's all dependent upon Jesus but where's Jesus at according to your Prophet he's depending on us of course now that if you don't believe it that's what I said maybe you never heard the answer you know read that to life well I never heard it like that I didn't realize that's waiting on us well what do you think it is a bus pulling up what is it folks what are you looking for if all these doctrines and ideas haven't stirreded up enough of the 50 years or something that you've been around to message some of you and you're in bad shape anyway but you don't want I don't throw off on them men I don't throw off on all those doctrines just went out you know why at least they was moving may have been wrong but they was moving right they were trying right instead of the Rapture well I'm just sitting down here waiting money so I'm gonna take place and every time a young man jumps up with a message people run after him right they chase him about the country thinking this is the guy they're supposed to take us in but you know what I don't mind saying it I appreciate those Brothers for at least trying may I quote brother Branham he said I'd rather see a little wildfire than no fire at all do you need that quote at least you got Wildfire you got somebody doing something that's right well what do you mean brother didn't I go to church when I can I'm there when I can if you was called on to speak this afternoon men women or children and it was assigned to you to speak to say you'd be here if it took ever doctor in the world to put you here I'm dirty but you tell me that ain't the truth and I sit and watch you backsliding and who's supposed to tell you you mean there's something more important than the word of the Lord right brother sitting right over here baby was put on death bed Eccleston Hospital I'm told that it possibly wasn't going to live they left the baby at Eccleston Hospital and came to the church on Saturday night because we was having Bible study and that again you know what you ever thought about that might have been what God looked at and reached down and touched that little baby and it's back there now well and fine amen all right he's dependent what do we got let's stand together one third hope the visitors don't misunderstand me I'm tough and rough and hard I know that but you won't go away saying I don't know what he's talking about because at least you do know what I say it and that's what I mean 113 is fine go ahead anybody have a name just remember in his word how he feeds a little bird and take your burden to the Lord please and all will turn out to be well father in the name of Jesus Christ we send this prayer cloth leaving all the saints here are dedicated to one thing to believing that by your stripes you break it manifest in Jesus name anybody else you know those people achieved what God said they would achieve you know what that means somebody you can achieve the finality of all of this and look death in the face and laugh at it look at them in life at least we can stand on his word when they told me I had leukemia you know what I said I said so I'm not going to be there anything else you can do to help this whole body praise God come on they can't find out now you just oh you ain't been on death's bed yet I hope I don't or you wanting me too but I certainly don't want you there I want us to be changed then our little petty feeling we'll find out they got left behind believe it anybody so thank you I wrote a little note there last night to myself to remember one thing or yesterday and I was reading the Bible and you know a lot of people would think that I've had it said about me you're too deep brother Dale you too you confuse the people you mentioned at least I give you something to think about you said we go down here to this church and they talk about the love of God and they talk about this and they yeah and what do they do I wrote myself a little note to remember the Bible is not a book of rules now quote the prophet it's a revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth is him personally to you right then what we read in the Bible is people telling us and Paul said I Die daily he meant that he was wanting to die out to himself then the things that are written in the Bible are the do's and the don'ts as we read it it just simply means the Life of Christ Living in you and letting him be the deuce and the don'ts of your life letting him live letting him walk and talk and do because it's not a book of rules rules is never saved nobody guess what brother Dale we got to tell them they're wrong the Bible says the goodness of God leadeth us to repentance right the Bible is not a book of rules it's a revelation of Jesus Christ but didn't carry it on over to what I'm talking about it's a revelation the word Jesus Christ is now is in his bride he's not to be here physically right we're supposed to meet the Corporal body in the air but he's supposed to become visible Among Us and raise the Dead that's pretty strong isn't it but not corporal not mortal we meet that compassion was so great a cloud of witnesses might changes when death does strike our way and we can remember there's more for us they are for them and more on my side than there is on the devil's side all I got to do is just run the race and get rid of the sin as we'll cover this afternoon that says so easily beset you what is that sin Lord Jesus we love you we thank you we pray that what we've said would be worthy and that for our lord for you to take it and speak to the hearts of the people may they see one thing that I'm just trying my best to preach Jesus Christ him crucified and living in US and showing Who We Are in your Prophet said he's waiting on us to take our stand and then he can move we love you father and we ask you to just bless and God each one now in Jesus name you dismissed the course what a day that will be when my jeans Jesus I shall see and I look
