everybody good to see the Cochran back there with us he made through everything Lord took care of him amen so we appreciate that and this coming up Monday will be Memorial Day we appreciate all of the the veterans and all the service people and everything that has served to you know to try to keep us free as much as we can and all and we we certainly appreciate it certainly honor them we honor all of the home front too because you know they have just as much to do with the the war as the people that are act like they fighting meaning maybe not getting shot at but yet having to supply everything to take care of so we honor everybody on on this day to to recognize you and appreciate you you know for for what you're doing to keep us at least to this time enough peace to be able to come together

for the places to eat and the things like that so just remember that any other announcements I know I generally forget something anymore Ephesians 1 and First Peter 1 Lord Jesus we thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely we just ask you to help us and guide us forgive our sins CU we know we fail you we know that we have many many problems but yet you've always overlooked them to be a be to where that you could come down in fellowship with us and Lord reveal your word and we thank you we ask you to just come and be with us today Lord and and bless each one and just thank you Father as we approach this coming Monday as a Memorial Day of a time but we appreciate all of those that have given their lives and and Lord that are giving their lives now today men and women around the world that we could have this freedom to be able to speak but we thank you for all of those that are on the home fronts are flying as we said the M the materials the things to help people Lord to be able to be there and do their part we love you and we thank you and just bless each one keep us safe in your grace forgive us father for sinning against you because we know we do continually but we know that you cover Us by your blood have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts bless Wade in June today as they'll be traveling back home be with him during the services and Lord guide each one in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1 I keep reading this because we're still dealing with predestination now remember it is not the person that comes predestinated eternal it is the word or seed of God all right but then there has to be a place when Martin Luther when he reached a place God came down with a word he had to be in the right place for God to bring the word to him there had to be all kind of troubles in Israel before God sent Moses there's always doing but see in in here we come down and we're trying to talk on it because in this day Time and Eternity is going to have to meet right here amen if not when will it meet it will have to meet sometime why can't we believe that we're here at that time where it can take place all right see and that's that's the only only thing I've been trying to tell you and to get a point to you okay Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame BL before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved all we go over to 1 Peter 4 and we'll begin reading at verse 12-4 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you now keep that in mind is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you and we don't count it strange when things start going wrong they to try you all right now is that true then all right but what does it say but Rejoice now brother Richard and I were talking this morning about the the things that are going on around the world you know that's a that was told us by the prophet and is told us by the Bible that will take place right that is the word of God and it will not be changed it will take place but we don't Rejoice because people are being killed right no we feel sorry for those people but the word of God is going to be fulfilled so we Rejoice because of the word right now you understand what it's getting to but rejoice in so much says you are partakers of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified you may be seated GL at his Blessing to the reading of the word now keep in mind what we're talking about adoption and showing it in three stages you know to try to break it down to where we can understand it better and uh the not missing the things that we need to see because the the whole stage of a person's journey in Christ is adoption bringing us into the family of God see and doing that we we become God's children he adopts us into the family as we'll get back to it in a little bit you know in the message because see it's it's hard to say to just come out and say something without explaining it because you know people will go so many different ways with what what you're saying so I try to take it slow and and you know and I'm sorry uh that's just the way I am I guess but I want you to understand see even like that as I'll repeat this in a minute even like the Lord Jesus when he reached a you know a certain age there in his natural life he was probably adopted because of the Customs that the people of Israel had he probably went through that bar ever how you pronounce that big old word that means they adoption he went through that naturally and he was born to almighty God all right but yet he went through a river Jordan experience a manner Transfiguration experience and a change of the body all right see but yet still you don't discount that he was naturally adopted but the natural adoption didn't do his spiritual adoption so the one of them would be a natural situation of life that we adopt people's children and all but in the spiritual condition God doesn't adopt them somebody else's children he only adopts his own children all right so that that's that's a different doing and you got to keep that in mind because the human mind will just throw into to uh into gear in different things and and and you won't understand but now I'll repeat some of that in a minute but I want you to get it because the last message we were trying to explain or have been trying to explain that there is a time in a Christian's Journey that you're born again that makes you a child of God that fulfills Romans 8 about 14 and 15 there where whereby the spirit of adoption see you receive the Holy Spirit the spirit of adoption all right we found that in in trying to bring it that it is not the the brother R said God G gives us a holy spirit to tutor us all right but the holy spirit is the spirit of the father or else you got two Gods you know are you or Jesus brother R said have two daddies so that wouldn't work so the Holy Spirit and the spirit of God the Father whatever you want to call it would be the self-same spirit so in the natural adoption the tutor is hired by the father to tutor the child you know which is a different person but in the spiritual condition of adoption God comes down to live in You and I by the new birth and that is the tutor to child train us and to bring us to the place to where that it can be finished that we can do the other parts of the the doing that's why I titled it adoption in three stages because I believe in things being Progressive I believe in progressive revelation I don't believe God gives it all to you at one time I believe he gives it to us gradually all right I believe in things all in life is Progressive you're eating you're you're growing and and things like that it's Progressive all right in science it's Progressive look at the science from even in my day of coming from a a horse and and and and know we couldn't even afford a buggy uh a mutant wagon what we had in going to church in a mutant wagon and you know and then coming up to where you know you're in the Jet Plane and the interplanetary travels and all of the thing so everything is Progressive well why would we worry to think about God doing his ways in a progressive form you know to do it all right see now the child training then is what's been going on from the time you receive the new birth and if you receive it today that starts your child training that's why we don't preach something as a blunt thing uh you know we get man the other day S one said all redemption's over you know and there's no more people being saved and all this that and the other well you know I don't agree cuz i f step the first come in the message there in in' 67 and they said you couldn't be saved after 63 I said I'm sorry cuz I'm going to seek God until I get it well you know in 1969 I received it and you know that I didn't have no more problems with with no troubles or even thoughts about it because I experienced it see I don't care what you think about me that's what I'm saying about what happened so then you know that would bring it to a place of of to me but now watch see I believe your child training has been going on right right all right the last couple of messages I stress heavily on the basis that we're looking back to what somebody done some experience some Pentecost our brother brandom you know and his ministries Etc and trying to compare what's going on now with that right well now brother Rand said that was wrong because he said you're looking back and only the frog look back all right but now see we can throw that basis but he said it's just as bad to look forward cuz there is no future you know tomorrow is not here yet all right but see we're looking for something great to happen and forgetting what's taking place now that's what your Prophet said about it he said that was the biggest mistake mankind had made well I call it the denominational mixup because that's what's exactly the Antichrist is trying to do he's trying to get us to look back he ain't saying this message is wrong right you notice that in the P I'm this is getting something to you if you notice in the past u 10 years all right you know that we had little problems and we'd have a little FL up here a little dude here and they they try to attack the message just way and they try to attack the message that way and they would make fun of us and but if you notice you hadn't paid attention in about maybe 10 10 years or maybe even longer you know we're becoming one of them I told you 10 15 20 years ago I said you let this thing go on and one day we'll be one of the biggest denominations there is cuz there's Millions around the world there's probably over a million in Africa that claims this message thank God for everyone and see we can say fear not little flock see we use that for our own doing but remember it's always we say little flock that means we and the rest of you that's like man up in South Carolina years ago he didn't believe in having relationship with your wife boy he preached against you know why he's 80 years old I'm playing why worry about that's right see you know but you see there always like I said if you're not little flock that means me in a little Mount well why not I want everybody in the world save I know they won't be but I want it for them I like the way brother R made it he said the third pull is for the bride and the church read your quote and to the totally lost we want to say for the bride to the totally lost you better read your quote cuz see even the foolish virgin getting in her place and things like that is the opening of God's word all right now but I'm just trying to get you to a point of looking at it see I believe something's been going on for the past 40 something years since the prophet has left all right now I just got to explain it if you receive the Holy Ghost today that's when you're starting your tutor and training but if you receive the Holy Ghost 50 years ago you've been in training and tutoring now you you understand what I'm saying that's been what's been going on well why can't we look at it like that to say something is going on instead of saying we don't see nothing going on but back under now oh yes back there well that's what the Bible said people would say had we been back there people have said to me you know if I'd have been back there with Jesus they wouldn't have crucified him I'd have fought well what are you doing now right see what we're doing now Pro what we would have done dinner we'll do later right see tomorrow rest upon what we have today but God is ever present the you know the I am which means ever presentent for eternity and see that's the point we got to do now remember I kept stressing it see we're looking for something to happen are looking back to what has happened and see of still of seeing what's going on and when I sitting there an office while I go thinking I try my best to explain things but in doing that I get in trouble I've tried my best to explain this message and got in trouble cuz people think I'm just an intellectual person that's explaining it intellectually and when I say that you bring Paul and Peter and them down here to where we are and they'd be glad to say let me go back to the Grave cuz they didn't fight fight didn't face 969 different denominations in 2000 in this message amen they only faced the Sadducees Pharisees and maybe a couple little sling offs right they didn't have the 200,000,000 demons right according to what they say I reckon that's 200 million well if there 200 million in this message we all got an extra demon besid all the demons we already had right but you see everybody wants to look back or look forward see I I've been looking at this for 40 something years of the child training the tutoring I preached on these things down through the years see it's been the time that you and I had to have yes see without child training you can't go up to a Transfiguration experience that's what everybody wants boy I get boy I get when I got born again I just man I got everything I'm ready to go I'm just waiting on y'all yeah well a lot of y'all is gone that was waiting on us but now listen I tried to make my point to this the prophet of God said and I didn't give you the quote on this one now but it's on who is this melz 1965 he said the predestinated is the only ones considered in Redemption right amen all right now he says the Royal Seed of Abraham is the only ones considered All right so God don't adopt the devil's children right but he has to give us the new birth to make us his children oh we're all son yeah we're all Sons and Daughters because God gave us life that's natural that's what I said a while ago Jesus went a natural adoption at somewhere maybe around 13 years of age or something because it was a custom but that didn't stop him from having to go through the River Jordan the Mount of transfiguration and the crucifixion and Resurrection see one of them was a natural thing the other one is a spiritual thing all right and see we're born again into the family of God yes to bring us to being God's children see all right but see I know what the quotes are the people of the message oh I always was eternal well then why don't you take and I'll happy I know I'm arrogant and hateful and mean but I I'll borrow money to help send you in that next spaceship that goes up into those Rockets it goes up you know because we don't need you here you know if you're already packed up ready to go up we'll just have to send you up you said well that's silly well maybe it is but don't get the point across you'll remember what I said amen cuz I believe you got be born again to have eternal life the prophet you say he said I always was eternal you better read the rest of the message called in the same message he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal that's what we'll to get to but see people don't like that they want quotes that make them feel good you know they don't want the truth of the Gospel amen but the prophet said the predestinated was the only ones considered in redemp all right see then we must become as I Tred my best to bring to you by the baptism of the Holy Spirit the new birth we become the children of God and receiving the holy spirit that Holy Spirit is our tutor which is the spirit of the father right this is not a natural story of God hiring somebody a second person sending them to you to to tutter you it's the Holy Spirit which is God himself Comes Back in the New Birth the prophet said your new birth is father son the Holy Ghost in you in the New Birth well I thought it was well what you thought Ain Worth to sense and what I thought ain't either all right now let me just state it this way see then the adoption truly starts at the new birth but it only will it'll be completed only when the Redemption is finished you know and and we're we're the bodies are changed and we become to immortality all right see that's just like I I've always taught you and you know it I've taught you the new birth starts the day you receive the eternal life right but it'll finish the day you receive an eternal body this body made Eternal will be the new birth finished all right so is adoption it starts with a new birth it is completed when we leave out of here all right so we're in the process see of it taking place see now wait this evening when we give some other definitions no but we know that according to Romans 8 like verse 19 that the whole world has been waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God right now I want to ask you something about that that means whole creation it means animals World trees it means everything's waiting right cuz it said you know the creation the world and all do you think the world's want to come to an end now I'm asking you a simple question to change do you think the world is wanting to come to an end do you think the animals is wanting the world to be annihilated do you think the trees are wanting to gr the creation you think that that see when we read that we just look at it the whole world waiting it's not waiting for the finality the world's not groaning for the finality that's right right the dead that's in the grave is not wanting the finality it's wanting manifested Sons and Daughters of God to be here that can call them out of the grave and bring them back to standing here on Earth not an Annihilation right see we just take something and just well the whole world's waiting want to be something what days the world get happy he won't be happy when it's going through a burning over that's right all the animals and things are being destroyed and all that's not what it is it's waiting for the manifestation waiting for a group of people to recognize who they are right here because I believe in eternal life here I've never Tau you anything up in heaven that we got to go there what I said that you you go too far that way you go too far that way don't do any one get what here according to my Bible and the prophet I've studied out for 40 something years now I thought we was going to be changing them on the twinkling eye right here I thought we was ahead of the world in the basis of where that our Redemption would be completed here and we would step into eternal life that's right and the world will go on it'll go for at least another three and 1 half years right cuz he really get the message when we leave out of here all right see want to worry about it but my point is I've triy to I keep putting it in here don't look backward to other people and things and try to judge what's going on think about what would happen if you brought those people down to this situation right that you and I are existing under when the prophet of God said the spirit of them that died and gave their lives under the lines and the things like that he said it's the same Spirit you use daily just to overcome he said it was easy to walk up and sound a Christian then they kill them but see everybody's Christian now that's right yeah oh we just want to change it and make different names out of it Muslim Hindus and this that new whatever you know because nobody's lost we all got a happy hunting ground but see we're not to look back to what some people is doing to compare what's God is doing neither are we to look forward to Something That We're expecting to come which we are expecting that but we're not we can't get over there right right see I want to get on that but I got this message and one in between and and then I'll try to get down to the headstone and the situation and what we're looking at but now listen the prophet has brought the message but the people must take the message and make the message alive right you agree yes that's what it's waiting on and the Bible doesn't say that that you know that the whole world is growing waiting for Meli for in the bases of say just brother brandom now read your Bible it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God plural not singular not just waiting for Brother brandom now we know for certainty without him coming first there would be no hope for you and I be anything and I told you there the other day and say it over and over the creation for a moment in brother Rand saw their Master cuz they saw a man that could stand there and God would back up his Worden amen all right now but you see look what your Prophet had to say on Christ the Myster of God revealed he says our headship is a kingdom this preached 1963 728 which is Page uh 76 but let get to the part at the bottom there 76 see the kingdom of God is within you the Bible says the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in her own life bring to PA every promise in this day as it did in that day this day as it did in that day once when the word and God was one okay that was in Jesus Christ right all right now watch and the word and God is one in his church today right now listen didn't it say The Prophet said in his church making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last days and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning at the Garden of Eden so what's the world waiting on manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God right to where that they'll come that head and body can unite yes now I'll go ahead and tell it to you then I'll preach it to you wait a few weeks down the road see to me The Headstone is what you receive at the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God as an example of amount of transfiguration experience that's right see that's why it hasn't happened because it has to be in every bride member for it to come forth into its fullness I don't to be sensible right but I'll get to that later see but he said that that it's that making the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message well I thought they would nothing left that brother Brown left it's not the people in Luther's day didn't add one word to what Luther said they had more a whole lot more mechanics right right more people amen and more getting into the word but they never added a word I offended them in a minist me one time I said when them seal broke to me in in 1979 I said and all through there I said you ain't added one word to what I said boy they didn't like it but I still stand with it today I didn't say nobody had to preached more than I did I would have not even thought of it see that's where I say something then if I don't explain it I get into trouble then when I do explain it I get into trouble so I'm in trouble this called me trouble all but you see what it's doing you how much have I tried to emphasize can you recognize your day in this message amen well yeah we yeah what see I'm po not all right people don't take or anything I'm pointing in One Direction like yeah we're looking back yeah we're looking back we're looking at what brother brandom all right wonderful thank God but I thought he was pointing to you and I amen I thought according to believe in the church AG book he said this Prophet would be pointing to the a word born right I said Martin Luther see it wasn't Martin Luther that put that thing that made him get that to going it wasn't his 90s something thesis nailed on the door that made it get out it was the people that begin to live the message Martin Luther was preaching then the cathol Church got worried they wasn't worried about one man they could excommunicate him cut his head off leave him gone but when the people started getting the message so it is is an end time and the bride begins to realize the prophet said who she is didn't say when the prophet realized who he is he knew who he was all right well what are we to do see so we've been in a child training period you said well it look like we ought to be cained by now well you know when you make that statement you are the one that hasn't been trained that's right is that blunt enough right nobody got a problem with what I just said if you got that thought then that means you're the one I'm talking about you're the one that hasn't taken the child training and let it develop you that's right because you wouldn't be saying it like that that's right see cuz you would be saying hey like I told you about the two brothers that one said he got all the Holy Ghost and everything when he was born again other said you ain't got nothing yet and I said Brothers I'm just somewhere in the middle well you know when I tried to explain a quote to them both of them ridicule me for banking it brother brandom said he met people that receive the Holy Ghost 50 years before him exactly like the day of Pentecost that's a direct quote you know that both of them ridicule me for the answer I gave but what's the answer you know cuz you've been taught it that there's a difference in the upper room experience of three three you know the 120 in the upper room and the 3,000 down Stars 120 in the upper room went to the faith of the fathers they received the Holy Spirit right here amen but on the day of Pentecost they received the Holy Spirit right here that's a simple answer right but both of them ridiculed me neither one of them took what was said see nobody else want either but there's one thing about it it's dark right amen now I've tried to explain so I'm going to give you an example I've tried to explain our child training you know through life I've tried to explain that even Jesus in his natural life he had child training right you yet he was almighty God cuz the Bible said he went home with him and was subject that's when he was like 13 years old when he was over you know with the the uh the doctors and the lawyers talking to them about 13 somewhere what he was 16 whatever year you got the Bible said he went home and was subject under them he had child training right see that was what so hard to me because I couldn't just I couldn't get him figured out I guess I was too much of a Oneness maybe but I just couldn't see that he could hurt himself cuz he was God I'm sorry that's what I used to think you know I thought he was God and he was but I thought he couldn't fall and hurt himself you know he start to fall an angel and just lift him up and you know and the little kid running along he he stumbled you know like look how many little kids of you fall one fell got the door hung today on the foot and everything you know I don't believe that I'm sorry I'm glad God opened my eyes I believe he went through days of life right as a child brother random went through it yes why wouldn't we believe Jesus he said he cut his mama's rug up and hung up in the tree and holled for T right why couldn't we believe that Jesus went through that you know he had to nurse his mother you know he did just come into the world and just lay there and never he used the bathroom he had to be GI trained for potty you know training and all this that the other but you see when it come up to the about 13 years of age cuz that's somewhere in that 13 15 16 whatever you want make it when he come to that place that he was with the Pharisees okay you know that there's like you know right at 15 years or something between there and his time of appearing on the River Jordan you know that's called The Silent years there's no writings of what he done there's fictitional things brought up you know that he done this the book of macbes and all of the different things but they call it the silent years because it wasn't anything written amen but now I guess you think well he's just well I'll be glad the next year gets here I'll be glad the next year gets here I I want get up and go do something now that's just F silly you say you're silly I know what I am but it gets a point across he went through child training he went through life yes and see for 40 something years we've been going through child training yes M right that's what's been going on that's why that's why it it hurts me when people say nothing ain't going on oh if it was just like it was back there even in a zeusa street we'll get to that in a minute we'll see whether you're right or not look get the point we've been going through a child training period that's right and it's been in the silent years but you can't say that here about everything because God has been on the scene here for a lot of things that we could talk about all day right many miracles many signs Many Wonders dead raay sick heel I used to say I'd seen everything but the dead raised and the eyes open the only thing I want to see now is blinded eyes open because I've seen the dead raised and I ain't worried about the rest of it so well it might okay why would you doubt it what's the problem all right but now listen there was plenty going on in Jesus's life from the time he was there with those you know talking to the Pharisees and the things it's called The Silent years but it wasn't God wasn't silent he was living his life that's right he was was doing great things his mother must have had so much confidence until when it comes to where that he first begins to appear she tells them about the wine you know the whatever he tells you do do it she might have seen a lot of things took place you know cuz I don't think he was just sitting around and wasn't doing I believe there was sick being healed all kind of things was happening in his life that he could just go and lay hands on somebody while it was coming up through that period of time all right I hope you get the example it's called The Silent years so if we want to call that the silent years or 40 something years since the prophet left the scene I still say something's been going on Amen it's been our opportunity to get settled in the word it's done a lot of church changing a lot of people's come here a lot of people's left here all right I don't say anything I'll just go ahead and tell you this cuz some of you wonder anyway brother Arline called me the other day and said he won't be back at church he's going down to brother mgar is okay that's I told I you big boy he said nothing wrong with the church said it's my private matters no that's that's your choice but you see I don't say people's off the word because leave here only thing I've ever said if you leave here and you find more than what we got here let me know where I can go eat you said you wouldn't do it well try me at least there's one thing about it we'll get the Tes but now listen see Jesus was a child a natural child and he came to a natural adoption into that family according to what their Traditions were but then when it come to the River Jordan he started a spiritual condition not a natural a spiritual condition that started with him you know going forth and being identified now I preached that to you right right see and then I said when we receive the new birth we're identified right cuz we're in a spiritual Kingdom right our headship we read Christ the Myster God revealed our headship is the kingdom what is that King the spirit of God living in us that's right now you see the spiritual Kingdom our spiritual adoption started when Jesus received his River Jordan experience and it starts with you and I in the New Birth because when Jesus received there and the quotes are there we agree with it 100% the prophet said he became the fullest of the godhead bodily on the River Jordan I agree with that 1,00% because see that would put then a him in a position that he could teach us as he grow that's right right are you listening as he grow because the Bible says the husbandman must be first partaker of the fruit so as Jesus grow in in the the the new experience of coming forth on the day of of his baptismal service he didn't have to have that we know the story he didn't have to receive the new birth we know the story he was the New Birth amen but yet what he done he went through that as examples for us right see then he went to the most horrible training to The Backs side of the desert for 40 days and nights without water or food and you can't go without water here in this climate where we're at you can't go down to the swamps and sit down in the swamps and live for 40 days without drinking water right so it proved you had to be almighty God cuz you want according to the Bible of course you can argue about it as well I don't know whether that was well okay argue about it do what you want to you diging your own hole anyway but you see the Bible said 40 40 days and 40 nights with no water no food started his training then from that experience he started his training the Holy Spirit was there to bring forth the message that was needed we start our training his lasted for about 3 years and then he goes to the Mount of transfiguration our training has been over 40 years years to bring us to a place that we start with our new birth and then we must be come to the place of adoption you know eventually we will receive that see we receive the new birth which is the spiritual Kingdom to make us a child of God the holy spirit being the tutor begins the process of adoption now put that down it begins a process not a completion a process a process means you just step into whatever is moving or doing you know and you're going forward that's a process I don't mean it's complete see but what I want us to see is that we have been going through that process since we received the new birth right all right most of you that are here other than the young ones coming along would say you receive the Holy Spirit maybe what 20 30 40 years ago maybe some of you would even say 50 years ago or more well all right you started the process to prove that it was the Holy Spirit you came to the message amen some of us receive the Holy Spirit after coming into the message that don't change anything but it's it's still whether or not we agree with the word amen now so something's been going on that's right to me was the most important thing that could ever be is the child training of our journey yes people say they got more out there they got more okay let's see what God says about it see now don't miss it remember don't look back and don't look forward look at what's being done I write it down so I just read it to you the people say I don't see much going on why them denominations have more signs than we do as a whole I agree with you I said as a whole I did a whole lot more of them right only is that purpose see but that's part of your child training now we're going to get real serious here about something that you better think cuz if you don't you're going to be in trouble right see part of our child training is to what to see if we will stay with the word is that your trial training that a child training to see whether you'll stay with the word no it's a nature of the F God to help us we become educated idiots I want to ask you a question see the part of our child training is whether or not we'll stay with the word or father signs and wonders but I want to ask you a serious question right there who does the signs and wonders no man can heal I don't care who he is brother brand who it was even Jesus couldn't heal right he could speak the word right now that's not agreeing with brother so and so that says J oh no the son of man had power to forgive sins he had power to heal but it's because he spoke the word amen okay all right now who is doing the signs and wonders no matter where it is whether it be in the body of Christ or where it be around the world or where it be the pope laying his hands on people or where it be in the Beatles with their songs and people people getting up and walking okay come on you're supposed to be understanding what I'm getting at who's doing it God is doing it if anybody's everever healed anywhere God heals them right sure when The Beatles got it bited up in a row the people forgot themselves and jumped up and run off walking but if God was the one that done the healing right all right then get it down right so if God is doing the healing he must be really doing what we read in a in a Peter that all these things is to try us that's right to see if we'll stay with the word God is doing the healing that's right to try you and me that's right people say well we ain't got as much as the be we can't work up to people enough to get them healed well it wouldn't matter if we could God is the only healer there is all right now get the point what I'm getting at I'm trying to lay down something see God is trying his church that's right he's been doing that for 40 something years he's been trying us to see if we'd stay with the word amen right see he's trying his church turn with me over in Deuteronomy and let's see how God tries his children think we love to read that in Deuteronomy or the scriptures there where says if a prophet give a sign and it come to P we're supposed to believe the prophet amen but what about this scripture Deuteronomy 13 what about this scripture let's see what God says he's doing we read over there in Peter that he was trying us with the things let's see how he does it everybody got it Deuteronomy 13:1 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give thee a sign or a Wonder now listen and the sign or the Wonder come to pass now you understand what that means sobody to get up tell you I want to show you that I am of God cuz there's 10 dead people laying right here in front of me and I'm going to speak the word and they're going to raise up and they do now what you going to do I'm going to praise God for the raising but I got to do something else about the guy that's doing it I just run that's what people do see get a little something going in the message and boy they just run after they just run after it they run after this run after that and it's the same people running here same people that run there they run after this in a while then they run after that in a while that's right well we got it we got it we got it then you just oh we got it we got it now you know it's true you been around anytime you know it's to you want to call names listen if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the Wonder come to pass where on he spake unto thee saying listen let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them you remember in in when the children of Israel was down there you remember what old Dayan and cor and then was going to do they made that golden cast you know they going to take that golden cast I never did believe I'm just plain language I never did believe it going back to Egypt to be slave they going back to Egypts as Victorious and they going to say he was afraid of us look what happened under Moses we got to God they had a plan they know what you're doing we said let us go after other gods which thou Hast not known and let us serve them Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet are that dreamer a dream for the Lord your God prove with you to know whether you love the Lord your God with with all your heart with all your soul you shall walk after the Lord your God and fear Him and keep his Commandments and obey his voice and you shall serve him and cleave unto him yes now God gives you a sign he raises 10 dead people what are you going to do boy he's got to be right no you got to check him now how you going to check him well I'll check him by this other guy that raised 20 people from the dead now don't don't be I know I play around when I say things like that and try to make it hard but I make it as a point turn over Deuteronomy 18 let's see how you check it let's see what God says for you to do anybody got it Deuteronomy 18 verse 20 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die listen how are you going to know the difference okay let's read and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord ha not spoken in other words how are we going to know whether whether this is of God or not right the man spoke it come to P how are you going to know when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing fall not nor come to P that is the thing which the Lord ha not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him checking by the word amen if he's carrying you the other one was reading carries you to another God now of course in the message you're not going to hear people preach a trinity but you hear them preach two Lords and Jesus wouldn't go at the River Jordan and he think that's a smooth way of doing it you don't hear him say brother random was wrong other than maybe a few quack and one of them that teaches to Lord said he wish he hadn't wrote the things in the church AE book that he did it brother around said because he didn't agree with it now that's what he said so just go ahead see of course that's you know that's all right that's brother well God sends signs among you to try you God heals the sick out there you agreed with that come on you're know better to agree with it sometimes cuz you know I got a reason for bringing if I ever ask you to agree with it so you agreed God done the healing so what's he doing out there he's Healing The Sick Around the World today right if there's a dead person raised God doing it you know what that's for to prove he's God number one number two is to try his church to see if she will stay with the word when maybe her signs and wonders are not as amount of the others give you a sign and it come to pass but take you to another God you're not to listen to him like some fell named Lowry years ago and people were talking about him and this lady said something to my wife about it and said we can't say nothing about him he's low they believe he's God she said was he do he agree with what brother rown said said no she said well then we can say all we want to cuz he's off the word if he's off the word he's off the word I don't care who what his name is all right but I gave you a bunch of quotes from Brother brand and look what he says from fellowship which is number two on your notes 1962 5:19 got it down in the middle of it you can read all between there and see it's working okay and what I'm saying but he's talking about he was a prophet look like God turned its back on him but just to try and see if he would stay with the word it looks like God turned his back against his Prophet some a lot of times right cuz he would allow things to take place he allowed Janice and jambre not even recorded as prophets they were M what magician he allowed them to be able to bring snakes after Moses done it he allowed them to bring flies fleas frogs Etc but he wouldn't allow them to be able to take them away amen cuz if he'd been they' have been able to take him away they could have healed that's what your Prophet says that's sensible M but God allowed that what would it be something to Moses him throw his rod down that God done told him you know what to do and he told his ride down and he become a snake here Janice and Jamber just told their down they become snakes M just run back to the Wilderness here I'm going I'm going to the burning bush CU I need to know more no he just stood still that's what I've had to do many a year because people running their mouth about all of this about we ain't got this we ain't got that to keep from hurting feelings when people would preach well we don't have this we don't see the signs and miracles you think I'm rough but I've tried my best to keep a calm cool about it knowing that one day God will prove what is and when he does not where about if I'm right it' be all right if I'm wrong I a take correction but see make sure your Corrections in here that's right our life we get through all the things forget that make sure your Corrections in here all right cuz see I can read too you know but listen he said we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word see if you'll be loyal to it right when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he is an illegitimate child and not a son and daughter of God certainly not he said the spiritually minded catches the word right exhortation 19 E1 exhortation on healing every how you say that I guess exhortation 51501 sometimes I'll admit this that our heavenly father sometimes chastens us with sicknesses sickness permitting Satan to do it if you're ever sick God has to permit you to be sick now I've explained that and I hope it's plain and I know that's what I said try to explain something then you get in trouble we're living in a world where cold and stuff like that doesn't mean that you're lost that's right we're in a world where that's happening we're talking about de demons we're talking about other things don't say every time you get a bad Cod my sinuses run to Devils after me no that's life that's right it's sicknesses that's right M he permits that to run on into some problem permitting Satan to do it to try us sometimes to bring us back right now listen to what he says if we go out of the way then our heavenly father might let something happen to us to bring us back but it'll only be for the good see the chastening of our father is not pleasant for a season but finally it brings things all things work together for good to them that love the Lord and if if it was way away from God and out of the will of the god that was God you know it's kind of hard to stand here and say that all things work together for good when Monday I guess it was a pipe busted off in the basement most of you don't know about it and it flooded the basement June was screaming holler and bloody murder cuz she had pulled a pipe and it busted off she was doing a wonderful job pushing up crying and trying to get everybody on the phone with a trash can and putting it over in and bailing it out and we got water you know you know over a lot of the basement but we never did i' sweep it out so I had to fix the PT and I done the best I could do the best thing I could figure out to do cuz the pipes were all set and there was no way to push it up to be able to put a fitting in to make it perfect okay so I buy one of these connectors that goes in between like that with the rubber bushes on each end and you tighten it down how many of you got them in your H all right works perfect except that time we left what day was it Thursday the last thing I checked was to make sure there's no leak on it we left about 5:00 something like that went home got back up here about 9:00 when got back to the doctor wife and things and the whole basement was full of water running out the doors so you know it was deep and here we are pushing it out the door you know and having to dry it up so if you go down there and a bunch of tile it's missing just look around it's floated off somewhere else you you say well brother Dale why what went wrong what did you do or somebody do that caused that I've done the best I could do to fix the pipe I ain't figuring out what the rest of it is whether it was God or the devil and I ain't concerned about it cuz either way I never lost my cool or my doing we just kept working and got the water out I tried my best to fix the PIP back okay it's hard to say all things work together for good I told that to a lady one time at their funeral and her husband had died and she said well how can that be Sam when I got a husband dying and a son over here sick I said I don't know sis but that's what the Bible says said all things work together okay got to be something out of it it's hard to do but sometimes you know you just he said he sometimes he let Satan bring sickness to us why so that he can heal us right I thought we believed that he was a Healer then if he's a Healer then somebody got to be sick right amen right well and I'm not like brother Mo said about it one time and I agreed with him he said this man said I I got I'm sick for the glory of the Lord Brother M like me is always too blown I guess he said well I guess you saying if you got one arm off for the glory of the Lord just cut the other one off for the glory of the Lord well he certainly didn't want to volunteer arms it ain't to say we're sick for the glory of the Lord It's to say that sickness comes upon us because of the natural environment things happen because of the world we live in and the glory of the Lord is we're delivered not that we're sick people say well maybe by me having this that they can find a a a a cure for this by testing my body now where you read that in the Bible oh but we want to make all you we try to make everything okay unchangeable God 1962 when God makes a DEC makes a promise and and opposition rise that's only the test whether you really got the word or not okay the man that's got good go don't mind going to the testing Stone see that's true see it's only Peter said I believe it that these trials are come to test Us Try Us see what we'll do with it M to see what we'll do with it okay second seal which 1963 319 look what he says God help our unbelief take it away from us Lord we want to receive Rapture in Grace we want to be able when that mysterious thunder thunder out you under and the church is taken up we want to be ready to receive it Lord grant it try us Lord by Thy word let us look into it and see look us look into it and if we see that we have failed keep on reading Shalom 1964 112 oh God may may permit Crossroads he may permit Crossroads to Tri to perfect us for his service he may permit that now church both here and on the tape he might permit the crossroads of our service for our service like he did Daniel he give a little Crossroad one day you know and he was a great man down in Babylon he did he let the king turn against him and throw him into a li throw him in the lon's den it only perfected it sure did let the Hebrew children go into the furnace it was to determine they was determined to stand for his word Shalom going on down which is a different no it's the same one but it's different paragraph paragraph 216 suffering for his name's sake is Growing Pains of his grace yeah suffering for his words that is growing pain of his grace yes sir just remember it's the grace of God has been given to you and see these were all most all of them was laying on my desk before all the pipes come off okay growing pain Shalom this is 1964 1119 number8 on no and so what when somebody begins to make fun of you say she's oldfashioned look at him he's i'll oh I'll tell you he used to be all right just remember is Growing Pains that's what persecutions good far is Growing Pains oh yes he permits crossies and Crossroads and Junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for his service he permits those things to happen can't you understand that he does that so he can perfect you for the calling he's called you for that's your growing pains he did Daniel that way he did the Hebrew children that way fary furnace what the only only thing the FY furnace does he says there just got the bands off of the Hebrew children but see we're looking at it so bad all right Shalom this is this is another paragraph in this same message 1964 1119 he talks about how that they they looked ahead they've done this they promised it you look and he says and then why does other things others make fun of me brother brandom you know others make fun of me and say I got long hair I got I'm oldfashioned to the women the men because I believe the Bible you don't have fellowship with us no more you can't accept we can't accept you because that that you believe such and such and you know exactly the way the word's written that's and you know it's exactly the way the word's written see you're staying with the truth now God Duty Bound to You to back up that Duty Bound to You to back up then that then excuse me God Duty Bound to You to back that up then he certainly is no matter what about it why they say to to make fun of us God's a jealous God remember suffering for his word's sake is growing F pains for of his grace when you suffer for his word's sake It's Growing Pains Growing Pains look at Del light when total separation lber 64120 paragraph 24 I know they stand criticism but if we wasn't criticized then there'd be something wrong the world always knows its own but as I said that remember criticism on the account of the word of God is only Growing Pains of his grace is shows that you have separated yourself to to to be a Christian to act like one to live like one obey every commandment of God it's a Nazarite vow you called to be separated from the things of the world Listen Growing Pains of his grace that's what we've been doing for 407 years well look like one of these days it' come to a place we get something you're not looking at what's happening number one so whenever things happens you remember the prophet I gave it to you the other day and see people can't see it amen I used to ask God and I know I'm serious and I know you don't understand me but there a certain brother used to come to this church and I used to ask him please don't do nothing while that man's here you say you I'll agree with you but you see that man was only built on signs and wonders and he'd run around the country SM spouting off about things happening and this church would fill up a bunch of unbelievers that all they wanted was signs and wonders I believe in it and you know better than to say anything about brother Dale don't believe in signs and wonders you know better than that cuz you know this man standing here can talk to you what what God has done and that I've seen an angel three times that I saw God when I was 10 or 11 years old that's not braging that's telling the truth so don't think that brother Dale doesn't believe in signs and wonders I believe in it more than anybody in this building or anybody in this world because I know what God is but I know if there's anybody healed anywhere he done it I know he's doing it out there to try me he's making it look like that we're nothing sitting here with sickness Among Us and all like that right people dying Among Us and other churches you're just rejoicing you even in a denomination just having great revivals and having great sweeping movings and having all kind of things yeah go there and look it over what have they got a bunch of shired short shorts on all kind of things running through the church but Glory Hallelujah they got the move of God M see that's to try you and even somebody come in the message to try to bring you to another Doctrine another God a river Jordan a two Soul or a seven Thunder virture or some kind of a Doctrine try to take you to them things it's the tri we've been in a child training period for ever since the prophet left to see if we would stay with the word God know the prophet that would stay with it but you know he casted him to see right you know that he knew Abraham would give his son but you know he had to let Abraham go up there and get ready right see that's my point sure I'm looking for something to happen I'm looking for when the head and body unit says a whole unit things are going to move but a whole unit won't be like everybody thinks it's not going to be everybody in this message because if we're not tutored and trained and positionally placed in the word to be waiting there is no headstone to come to that person which means we're going to go by the grave if we don't reach that place that's right and I said that how many years ago 30 that there would be plenty of people in this message that would die and go by the grave because they did not have nobody to teach them the message that the prophet had brought right you know that's been said 30 20 30 years ago yes cuz I reminded you of it 20 30 times I guess or 100 times that's right not to be nasty or sarcastic but to tell the truth if I don't have it and I don't have the goods I'm going by the grave I'm talking about that I I'm a born again Christian and I'm even come to the faith of the fathers maybe see coming to the faith of the fathers is just a place to be waiting for the headstone to come brother Mo preached that years ago and I Rejoice he said there a place we got to be waiting what do you think I read that quote to start with that the hi and body have to unite in the last days to bring the message I've told you over and over I'm not arguing about brother brandham coming back whether he's coming back what he I believe he'll be back but I believe it'll be in the resurrection of all the saints amen and then he can preach to us for 30 40 days and that way I've told you what I even believe that he through a supernatural being could stand in every Church in this message and preach if he wanted to at the same time do you think brother Dale don't believe in Supernatural I believe that God is so Supernatural he could stand in every every Church in this world at one time that's right and be standing there as a person that's right right cuz he's God but you see he's trying us but why would we we be concerned Brother D you hurt my feelings cuz you're talking about me brother M used to make a good illustration and I've never been there and thank God for all these military people has been there but you remember when some of you older ones had to do the crawling underneath the Bob wire and the Machine Gun was shooting over the top of you with really live ammo right well you know nobody didn't get hurt unless they stood up well that's what brother M point was I can shoot a gun all the way across this congregation right the only person going to get hurt one standing up so if the shoe fits wor but listen I'm trying to get you and I to see God has been doing the greatest thing that he could ever want to do and that's child training his children to see if they'd stay with the word he has sent two Souls s tund virt polygamy all of these things among the people of the message the George Pikes the low's the the all believing they were gods and things he's let that come Among Us to see if we go after it that's right and giv them signs and wonders that looked like it was backing up their Ministry n it was proving God was real but he done that to try you and me yes to see what we'll do with word let's stand come on you to see if we'll stay with the word brother Dale you ain't nothing but word word word will you tell me something else supposed to be then I'll just be glad to change with you cuz I believe signs follow them that believe right we've seen God come here and do great things well I'm sick well okay believe it well I've asked God I've asked God I've asked God and he ain't delivered me ask him one more time but believe when you're asking that he hears you I used to go with brother M them when they go pray for the sick cuz I just a young Christian you know even at a Christian but coming out of the Baptist I used to go with him I remember we were up here at a Hooper family and uh brother Mo began to explain scriptures and I got them written in my Bible in perfect order like he'd explained and one of them was if God hears you and he'd say you know God is so great he can hear a gat as it flaps its wing that he can hear everything that ever does in the world said surely then he hears us cuz he said if we'd ask anything in his name and I saw a lady paralyzed set up oh yeah they had they had a son that was a Pentecostal preacher and he prayed for the sick but when it got serious they called brother mol and brother Tatum we got there that day and she took him she said told that boy she said take that Bible and lay it on my feet I said well let's ladies you know brother Mo when got we got through praying she just sat right up in the middle of the bed just just straight up sat there probably 20 minutes and I thought my Lord she's pretty heavily set okay you know pretty weit a lot and I thought my Lord I couldn't sit like that her feet just is straight out it wouldn't straight she sat there I thought well there one thing about it God had to touch that lady and brother Mo said to her now when you get the feeling better you you put a forth a little exercise on on your own you know said you get get up out of the bed you know kind of ease over the Ed she said you get out of this room I'm getting up and she did I started off seeing Miracles that I was a Baptist that believed in then I saw the god I believed in you know all right what do we got 272 in his spiral book 272 in his spir book anybody have a need cuz I still believe that same God here my come and qu of my soul bre of have here's my you are the no matter what we are nothing to do what we said about youbody El my Lord I
