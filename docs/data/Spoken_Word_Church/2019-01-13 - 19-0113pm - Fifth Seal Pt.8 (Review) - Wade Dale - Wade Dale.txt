hey man good to be in a house with Lord ma'am we got a house full it's good to be here it's a new year new day we're on this side of the dirt what the old man said he said it better to be seen than viewed think of that never understood why people walk up to a casket and go they look good no no that's that old shale that's that shale that I'm gonna read to you about it that come from our adulterous mother Eve they men and what that body's gonna be raised and changed not so much a miracle if you just throw that in the way and getting another one it's not no miracle lather there's no where we're coming to that but what about the same one you lived in the one your mom and daddy did bring to the earth God's gonna so change it til it's gonna be eternal that same body that came out of Mary did that same body came out of Mary was changed and now he's still standing in it the one who has reached immortality and we're heading in that direction good to be in the house of the Lord got a couple announcements myself adult group practice after second service please stay in the building so they don't have to track you down everybody got that again adults who are singing in the group practice after the second service that would be in a few minutes hours stay in the sanctuary okay also there's a black chair downstairs the one that Tony Tony I'm giving you a chair away son sorry the one brother Tony Smallwood sits in but it's our old chair that used to be up here if anybody wants that please make it disappear today please make it disappear today we have like seven chairs in our house and we don't need another one so it's a nice leather chair brother Tony I tell you how it sits this pretty good brother Tony doesn't see it ya see that bus is good so make it disappear but also good to have other Chris rentals with her hadn't seen him in a while have been a few years and he's not a stranger to the message he's been around for a while he he hangs out with brother Larry and that's alright they've been friends for a long time though and and we've got to know him over the years and he's he's watched in a few times so he's not a stranger he's not somebody we have to background for so I also remember one thing les several years ago brother down told us that when we did our prayer request to make sure we put them in before the service started now if you don't get here before the service started that's your fault but you need to put your request on a piece of paper and give it to brother Terrence not so much to be done out in the congregation now brother Dale said that already several years ago so it it needs to be done that way that's the way he wants it done so we need kind of we kind of slipped from that every once in a while it's kind like a teacher you know you you get by with it a few times and then then you know you see something about it so make sure you put your prayer request in on the sheet of paper where it says prayer request and hand it to brother Terrence or either led up here on the pulpit very simple like I said if you don't get here for service starts though that's your fault put it in later or give it somewhere else but that's the way brother Dale wants it that's the way we need to do it it needs to be an order put your prayer request in and if you want to have a testimony you got okay brother Dale so you make sure you do that also okay let's just keep things in order amen just keep things in order that went supposed to be you know what the Lord is pleased with order he like he does not like chaos the Lord loves order so we we do too so let's pull it open our Bibles or plot revelation 6 today we're just going to review the 5th seal again brother Dale and I were talking about a few things when way back from to and from the hunting club the other day and I think I need to do one more so he brother Dale's never the one that really says you need to do this but if he starts talking about something that's the suggestion to do it so because the Lord speaks to him speaks to all of us if you like you downstairs in Sunday school class I said look whatever we're gonna do what y'all want to do y'all get together decide what we want to do in a Sunday School class it can't be just me me me all the time take suggestions and and you know what if you filled with the Holy Ghost and God may speak to you one day and he doesn't speak to me and you know what we're supposed to be able to accept that and say well let's do it this way right like brother Jason Watkins Friday night did an outstanding job he's he said I've been doing this at my at my church for ever how long he said he said and I keep wanting to go this way and he said the Lord just does not want me to go this way so you know he kind of beard off and I like what he said he said Lord he said you're here you've been here he said I'm just showing up behind the pulpit so use me okay to let him do the speaking cuz if I do the speaking it's just a meeting of minds but it's the Lord to do the speaking then we ought to see that that that's the way God speaks to us through a fivefold ministry that's the way he speaks to us and and that's just the way it is and that's another thing that's just that's the way God liked it you know why because God's all down through eternity that that's the way it would work so he put apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists in the church for what the perfecting of the saints and we're all saints that are baptized with the Holy Ghost we are the Saints of God so we're just going to review a little bit today but bring up maybe one or two more little BT points just to reiterate this fifth seal because truly as you get to studying a little more on it it opens up more and more and more and that's why folks today it's supposed to do that supposed to open up more and more and let's remember brother how he failed downstairs a few minutes ago so let's just remember him and pray he's okay the table and chair wasn't too good but he's okay but let's remember him in prayer he kind of lost his balance we need to we need all help each other out physically and spiritually a man so let's bow our heads before we get started tell me father we thank you for this day Lord we're in 2019 who would have thought it but we're here you knew that it was not a secret to you father it was just something that we didn't think was going to happen but I think in your Bible you told us that your ways are not our ways and your thoughts are higher than ours and you knew we would need this length of time to come to maturity so here we are lord I pray that you would truly be the active participant in the service you take over Lord and you do the speaking you do the hearing you do the revealing and follow me brother how touch his body as he's limped up there up the steps Lord we pray that you just touch him right now Lord and this you'll restore him back everyone in this building Lord needs to touch from You Father and as the word goes forth we pray that whatever whatever symptom that we brought in this building that we will not leave with it that it will be taken care of because you said you sent your word and healed us and as we know that you are the word and the word now has become flesh and the word is here it's breathing it's living it's it's not dry bones anymore it's a living group of people and you knew we would be here so you equipped us for this moment you equipped us for this time now I pray that we would use that equipment that we would listen and hear understand what you're saying father just forgive us of our sins and blessings be with the missionaries on the foreign fields we always say Lord give them fruit for their labor father because they truly are laboring for you thank you for bringing brother Lewis back in the family Lord we we're under anticipation for the for the service Wednesday - to tell us some of the great things that God's doing another country bless the rest of the service Lord you take over in Jesus name Amen alright revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true that's now not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also in their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and you may be seated in the word add his blessing to the reading of the word now I want to I'll get it in just a second I think I'm on we might just hang loose every minute brother Danny's won't know if we're going to use the board we just might use it and we might not be less let's just look at our review if you want to pull the review up on the board again I want to kind of go slower through the review just for a second to get us as we were talking the other day this fifth seal brings a lot of things into view and we're going to try to prioritize them a little bit later in the service but we're going to try to get over this first part of the review because love as we see the first seal open I read it last night I'm starting into the sixth seal reading a little bit and if you're reading ahead of me or reading in the seal book right at the first brother branham says and it's kind of ironic that this morning we read and we're going through the book of Romans so I think it was Romans 11 or 12 or 13 good to have you with us again said I forgot test film y'all were here we're happy what brother Rafael okay alright well good to have you here they're not strangers either they've been here before hey man good to have you sister and your and your and your daughter with you you just grown up Wow so we look at the seal the seal brother Aaron said there's two powers that's what we were talking about this morning in the book of Romans there is there's a there's only one power and that's the power of Almighty God and man Satan has really no power remember all the seals we've been reading power was given power was given power was given you and I give Satan the power amen but there's a higher power there is a power of God then there is no other power he permits Satan and what Satan does is he prevents the power of God because you're not really read back in the seal and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals don't have to go to it and I heard it were the noise of thunder one of the beasts saying come and see this is when we first started behold a white horse and him it's Aaron had a boat a crown was given unto him and went forth conquering and to conquer second seal they went out another horse it was red and power was given to him and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword power was given so there's only two there there's really brother branham does say there's two powers which is the Antichrist in Christ but really this guy over here is X doubt there's no power Satan has no power unless we give him the power mm so we need to stay under the power of God to take what God give us he is our head as we were talking this morning in a Sunday School class there's only one power well that's God and then he has power over us I wish you would understand that the fivefold ministry sure it's been set apart as a predestinated group to help us to perfection but if but if a pastor is preaching and I'm a teacher I become a sheep in the front row or whatever I become a sheep I'm not sitting over here in office outside of Olivia I'm sorry Olivia says you go over here and down that way and I did the very same after wasn't gonna do it one over there but if I said on the front row I become a sheep we're all sheep we're all female in the body of Christ we all have a head and then God tells us as you treat your wife so does God treat you because you are his wife and you have a head brother Dale is the head pastor of this church but he has a head that he has to talk to he's not set aside and now it's for all y'all but it's not I don't have to do that now that's not right that's the devil that you know what that's in the beginning the very anointing that Satan took was well I know your God but I want to have some power too I don't want to know I don't want to do that I want to do something different you see how contrary that is but God did annoy him he was the anointed cherub God gave him power to do things so we look in this seal there's there's the power of the white horse rider as he rides off I like what brother Bob was talking about Wednesday night man he did a good job winds you know I mean give him a hand you man telling him he did a good job but we must see that that we know one thing for sure the devil is near the devil is there but when you see that devil in that white horse right away from you there's a separation then God's becoming more prevalent in your life because you're getting rid of this part then you're getting rid of another part because look once we get rid of all four of these parts the bad part look what happens we take a body change and then so as the one horse rides away we truly need to see that that's a revelation that that doesn't bother you anymore things I used to do I do them no more right but that justification I kind of wrote myself a little note when you come to this you know when you come to baby form justification and I may spend a little more time I'm sorry on this but I feel good this way when you come into baby form justification you're just like a baby that is trying to walk you just fall everywhere and you beat your head and your knees and you you know you just look horrible but mom and dad is still going come on come on so you're what I'm saying is when you start in your Christian journey there's really your wobbling you you don't know really you still got that old root of bitterness in you in that baby for him justification you hadn't become born-again yet you've still got that old man inside of you he's not dead now he's he's choking he he's choking but he's not dead yet I mean you might be how that little grip around him but still he's talking right but that part of that's the baby form of your journey into Christianity you're not even really Christian anymore at that time you're not you're heading toward it and those who is justified he's already glorified but God's the only one who knows whether you gonna continue on or not okay you don't yet at the moment know even now that you're gonna take a body change are you gonna go by the grave you don't know that I've got to believe that we are in the process of that and that we're in the right channel got to be at the bus station to catch the bus amen somebody said that one time before don't sing got me at the bus station to catch the bus all right can't have a ticket for a train gotta be at the bus station all right so in that part of justification you really don't know what's going on but now this part of justification you're coming to a knowledge because you're already born again when the steel part is as though you never did it when that part of justification opens Cassie look the seals can't open to you unless you're a born again you can forget it the seals cannot open to you until you're born again but when you're born again then you come into the light of as though you never did it you're coming to a knowledge or you're not staggering because of worldly things anymore you know what you're doing you're staggering because there's some things that the preacher preaches that you don't understand there's some staggering going on when you match play and brother Branham says something you go wait a minute right all right oh you've never done that before come on people how many times have you hit rewind what's he saying write or go back and hear the preacher preach turn that again let me again well see that's that part of justification you're already born again you're already cleaned inside you're just working on the next guy you're working on your memories the conscious veck sees major nation alright but now look to me that really the seals in it is an introduction to the total plan of redemption when you start in this seal one that's not baby form justification but justification as though you never did it you're coming to a realization that number one I am the bride of Jesus Christ I like what brother Jason said Friday he used me and dad as an example he said my brother Wade there's no way that you can deny that that's your daddy but you did nothing to become his son you're just his son same way with God same way with God you come to that realization see that's where the people can't get it separated when they say you always was eternal they think when use a little baby you know but now now you come to the realization that everything was in God and then it transferred to you remember remember on the day of Pentecost brother Brown said they didn't become sons they were always sons well now they weren't always sons listen on the earth when they walked up and and said we don't understand what you're saying now they weren't a son of God at that time but now on the day of Pentecost because they were predestinated because they were in the mind of God because they had what representation that when the word did strike home they didn't have to say that in the more they just took the word that Jesus preached and they didn't need a tape recorder they didn't need somebody to write it down they didn't need a Bible they didn't have a Bible they were the Bible same way with you and I that's what we gotta we gotta evolve back into that we've come to a place to where we have to have quotes we have to have scripture we have to have this do we they didn't the first church never they didn't they any brought their own sermons down they just spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance by some people like notes and we have quotes to back up the notes but you know what somebody preaching false doctrine today has quotes to back up their nose so you have to be careful but listen I'm gonna make this statement and I'm gonna cover the whole thing in a nutshell if the seven seals or even let's just say this one through four if the first four seals have been made known to you now get what I'm saying then you're in the line for a glorified body because look after the fourth seal the rapture takes place all right so you're in a good line don't mean you will but you're in a good line you're you're at the bus station with a bus ticket now it's your problem to get their own time you can have hello you can have a bus ticket it's like I said Friday night it was supposed to this church post started 7 o'clock it's 7:15 brother Burleigh shows up shows up I told them I said 7 o'clock was just a suggestion like now the Ten Commandments they're 10 suggestions not Commandments they're just suggestions they suggest you do this but anyway we can't be late for the bus why because the bus is going to leave at 7:15 if that buses don't leave they're not gonna wait on you they might give you a little grace a couple of minutes if you're how many times you've been in the airport and you hear this and all you do is you see some little woman usually a woman don't hardly ever see men how old are you here she comes pulling her little face well she had her ticket she was heading to the right place to get on the plane she was you're late and I mean she I'm talking about a bride okay I hope you got that I'm not picking on the sisters I'm telling you we're all cheese we're the bride let's don't be doing this right cuz even a foolish virgin same same thing we need to buy our oil from you we need to take this journey we need some oil for life you're too late we've got just enough for us you should have been here when the bus took off because we fixing to leave right so let's go back to this no justification as though you never did it so we're coming to a time now to where when the seals opens to you I don't say that you can't be an error but I'm telling you you're you're getting into that line to where that when the seals open to you it's a special thing it's a special thing it's a special operation of God he has not revealed these seals to no one in all of 2000 years it has been sealed it was even sealed to the people in Jeffersonville Indiana in 1963 when brother Branham said it's gone from you it's not for you you're not even supposed to get it but you and I weren't there you and I are here now we are present I like what brother Jason said and I told him afterwards I said you should have went just a little bit further because you know he's talking about the I am how are you how are we gonna get out of here because he I am is ever-present right I said answer me a question when Moses walked up to Pharaoh they said let my people go Pharaoh said you and Aaron I got 50,000 people out here you and Aaron who's gonna let you put who's gonna deliver these people Moses got a revelation at that moment he said I am I am so folks who birthed you into the body of Christ the I am so who's going to change your body I am who's going in a rapture I am make it personal because we're not if we are prophetic people but we are not prophesying we are part of the prophecy but if you prophesy that's telling of a future event this is not a future event this is reality so we come to justification it's not that we're back into the world and back out we're back into the world back out that was baby form justification now we're solid we've come to that statue of a perfect man where that big wide foundation of faith it's telling us it says though we never did it and we keep reading then we keep studying we keep eating then we come to sanctification we see that red horse that was riding in your life that red horse leaves sanctify God sanctify listen Satan will never think to fire you I promise you if you come to a stage of sanctification it is not the devil that did it but hold on a minute but he's gonna make you think you are saved in that position right there now not this one we're pointing I'm talking about baby form sanctification you come to baby for in sanctification the unclean spirit goes out right seeketh RAF's walked in dry places seeks breath find his nut and comes back finds the house swept and garnished and bring seven of his other buddies with him and they enter and reside back in the house now that's not this right here we're not worried about the devil in the statue of a perfect man getting in your soul so you still got that you still got that control center in this part of sanctification and sanctification the unclean spirit goes out baby form not this baby for him and he can come back brother perhaps they didn't come back and give you a religious spirit and make you think you're born again but now that's not in this one right here no no this is the statue of perfect man this is coming to the statue of the perfect man this is God dealing not with your soul but using your soul speaking to your soul and let your soul work out and then into the spirit realm because that's where we need our help how many times have we said that our spirit realm before we need help if you're so if you're so today at this very moment is either black or white it's either black was still sin or it's white with the new birth the Creator resides in your soul are the guy that got permitted power is residing attached to your soul and he's telling you what to do but in this part of sanctification what happens if that unclean spirit sure it gets out there but it tries to come back in but he can't get in the soul so he tries to reside in the spirit realm give you trouble like you would not believe but that's why the brother Dale has been through it we've all been through this that statue of a perfect man is the most ill taught subject in the message but it is the most important besides the new birth it's the most important step or message that could be brought because you can't understand the seals without that and the daniel-san what's how brother brown preach that he preached him almost in sequential order he preached the statute perfect man after he preached his heels right he preached him before spoken words regional seat before why because that's the preparation time to come into where and I believe that brother Branham could have stood on the week of that seal and somebody said brother Ram who's going to open these seals he said I am because he and you become so one with God Adam listen Adam was the I am of the day he was in flashing I was thinking about this yesterday God so God knew what Adam would do but he's so trusted Adam he said you take care of the world I'll take care of heaven every animal that he named he didn't listen even when Adam fell God didn't back up and say well now everything you've done at him I won't wipe off and do it again no he just kept right on going you know why cuz in genesis 3:15 he said i'm coming it's coming I am who's come because when Jesus was on the cross there was the I am he's gonna stay in the world I am that's why I said before Abraham was I am he identified exactly who he was and what he was doing everybody so sanctification is going up the statue a perfect man the black horse rider we showed us the new birth and they're not the new birth the first one the new birth sure now look it takes I was think about this the other day it when brother I made that statement about the two powers it takes a contrast remember brother Brown said it had there had to be a night time for you to enjoy the day the law of contrast so there had to be a darkness in your life we were all dark and then we were all dark but now even if the new birth something has to die that excuse me that old nature had to die so there had to be a death you had to put that thing in the ground so that you could what be married to Christ to get it you're already in the family remember you received the spirit of adoption that your new birth but you're going to receive the adoption to wit the redemption of the body in that in that new birth it's not a new new birth but why is the Holy Ghost written on a piece of tile right Holy Spirit actually it's a refilling of the same thing you got because the same thing you God's going to take you to heaven and then but you and I are working toward the body change without seeing death something never happened that's why it's so important that we don't prophesy because if you promise if you prophesy you die even Jesus prophesied he had to die brother Branham prophesied he had to die why because they were looking at a future event but when the I am is here that's not a prophecy sure Isaiah stood and said uh virgin shall conceive it took seven hundred years later but when Jesus stepped on the earth somebody might have said what in the world was out there talking about Jesus said I am because when he said before Abraham was I am he was telling them that before they even came on the earth he was already in the Old Testament ever present for eternity everybody all right so now seal number four now seal number four to me hugely important but if you don't get the other three here we go with the stepping stone or the stepping blocks or the corner stone if you don't get those you can't get how can you get if seal number four is brother Brown said all three combined well what if you leave one of them out you can't leave one out you got to go listen I've said this before I say it again if there was a better plan for God to get you where you need to be we would be doing it but this is it this is the plan of redemption we have to get in it go buy it and we'll be taken up because of mmm so who's gonna take a rapture I am you know why because it's all gonna come present because it's a future event but brother Branham said your rapture started when you became born again that's your new birth who's gonna be preaching one day who's gonna be in the congregation one day and Robert Tatum is gonna walk through the door I am see how personal that is that takes away trinitarianism when you see I am you don't see three you don't see one like your finger my brother Dell said this morning you see a mini membered body that is one because I am that I am so co4 we see it was a pale horse it was all three you've got to have justification sanctification and the baptism the Holy Ghost before you can take a body change we've got to step up into a higher form of justification sanctification about the whole go just like we're talking about here because the word truly is made flesh and who you to accept that God is their personal Savior I am I am everything now as I am I mean listen we can't say we we're not we're Gentiles or individuals Israel can said can say we are the 144,000 and we are going to take a rapture because Israel is saved as a nation you and I are not a we we're an i that's the one singular professor personal pronet one I I'm standing here today not three of me I am standing here today all right so who's gonna take a body change okay and brother Joe Canada pulled up a song and he sang it today about the I am we're gonna sing it maybe next unto your something man it's good but you know what that's a prophecy to you until you understand the I am is already here I love what brother Jason said he said most people in denominations are getting saved from a historical event think about that remember brother Brown said they couldn't get Jesus off the cross a historical Jesus is saving them because he's he did that back there but what about now that we know that he's right here he's the I am he's ever-present when I received the new birth it wasn't a God hanging on the cross it wasn't him a God in heaven it was a God that personally met me right here same way with you so now in the fourth seal the bride's caught up death is destroyed a resurrection has happened who's going to be part of the resurrection y'all haven't learned yet have you who's gonna be part of the resurrection thank you who's gonna be part of the body change I am this is getting good one more time and you know what though that I am though brings things to pass when Jesus said before Abraham was I am he brought it right there if they wouldn't understood you see how blinded they were he's telling them I am the one called Abraham I am the one I am Melchizedek he wasn't that wasn't a separate person if they would actually said well what about this milk Esme he said I am who was one who talked to Moses in the burning bush I am who's wanted talk to Adam in the Garden of Eden I am who's one who said let there be I am see what I mean it was ever-present right there the whole thing that makes it personal maybe that would help you a little bit alright seal number five is what we've been talking about now that we have to come and bring something else now I wrote myself a note I better read it because when we come to these four stages and take a rapture when we start this journey it's an introduction to the plan of redemption the full plan of redemption okay now the full plan of redemption is body spirit and so now a lot of people have come to redemption of the soul but they're in the grave their bodies not their spirit went back to God their body went in the grave and they went in the sixth dimension no no shame in that none zero zilch lord of mercy tax times coming up I wish I could sleep over and see the mansion for a little while by God rot Rebecca hey Rebecca does half of our taxes in this building so she knows what we're doing well she knows all y'all you know if we got some truth serum out week mm-hmm that's all right death and taxes that's the - sure of things right but they're not sure to us cuz he's gonna take a rapture this is gonna take a body shame okay everybody all right so when you come through your journey it's an introduction to the plan of redemption you're just learning it because you know what because you're still contrary brother Larry your body and your carnal mind is still contrary to this eternal thing that we got listen if we really understood the eternal thing we'd already be changed but we've got what go to prime Jesus went to a process my brother Dale said this morning sure Jesus didn't know all things he had what he had gray matter he had a brain that was a baby brain googoo gaga cried for mama but he was Almighty God but he was encapsulated in a flesh because he had to be your brother but if you could ask that little baby said who's gonna save the world he gonna say I am just let me grow up a little bit more get out of these diapers and I'm gonna help y'all out if that's to me that's the most real God I know they can be a baby and be a teenager and be all these different things to each one of us and he can laugh right now in another dimension that we just said that cuz he was here physically on this earth but if you would ask and we know that he didn't know it at that time I'm just making a point but I promise you though when he come to Calvary the devil that came to him in that garden that give him all that trouble remember he was troubled in the garden I believe he finally at one time he stopped Saints in Sweden you're gonna you're gonna go die for these people what do you though he says yes I am I've come to do this this is my job and my job is to get them to believe me cuz how many of y'all so Jesus hanging on cross you have to believe that's why we're believers brothers and sister Laurie that's why we see and never president I am we don't see her Jesus hanging on the cross uh we see an empty cross we have an empty cross on an empty tomb hey man you know why you know why he's in you he's hidden in flesh again hiding himself in simplicity now to me this seal number five is to justification where the real you never did it no we already talked about that but I believe that it really reveals where the I am is you saw no gods residing in me but do you really know that do you really know that but that's just hearsay though the dick said the word tells you absolutely no doubt that's where we get our that's where we get our thought but you got to know it you got to know it it's got to be where you say who's gonna move that mountain hey we're getting it that's what he said he said you say listen folks I'm telling you we got to start being a little bit independent [Applause] stop being Catholic Rodale save my kids brother l can't save your kids only God Almighty can save your kids we just have been commissioned to live before them Yeah right but you understand what I'm saying you pray for you kid you believe now we'll all believe no doubt as as a family of God we're believers but you got to believe and you got to say who's going to take a rapture oh no brother Dale is gonna go and I'm going with on his coattail you can't even go on Jesus's coattail that's hearsay never want to talked about hearsay the other day on in sermon that's it's all hearsay until it becomes a reality until you can speak it back yes a hearsay even these quotes that I'm gonna read you is hearsay but when that quote becomes a reality and it clicks in your mind and you say that ain't nothing but the truth you know what happens when the lady said that ain't nothing but the truth she said that ain't nothin but the truth because the IM was there so justification the real you never did it now this week gonna just for a second that this is the grace seal to me that's the thunder we know what the 5th seal is the 5th seal is to jews that were killed in our Eichmann and Hitler and are given robes we've been through this for seven sermons these are the people that were given robes not because they were Christians note that were given robes because God blinded their eyes literally blinded his own children's eyes so that you not could come in to me that but the Thunder underneath that is is that you you and you all know who you are no were you going but you know what you're doing here that 5th seal to me reveals that brother Dale and I were talking about what we're gonna get into a complete total plan of redemption for every person on the face of this earth that has lived from Adam to the Future home that's how powerful that fifth seal is and I'm gonna just not read we've read these that let's just brother Joe if you want to skip over actually just don't do anything let's bring that chart back just for a second Danny I'll get it don't worry about I'll get I'll get it stay right there you getting older you ain't as old as Joyce but you know I can say that George George to me are not the same age yet but in just a few more weeks we will be the same age and called her an old woman for a little while anyway older lady older sister 59 years old I was telling her Sunday School class downstairs me and daddy were talking about something other day and I saw about him being in message for so long he looked over man he said you've heard of this message 50 years remember you and I'm like I'm 58 we came into message when I was 8 years old yes I've been hearing brother Browns voice well now they was that gap in there when I didn't I wasn't a believer but I've been hearing this thing for 50 years hearing this message for 50 years think about your experience you've heard this message for 50 years and thank God for what grace that he's led us you know what I'm glad to rapture didn't plate take place in 1977 how many of y'all were even born before how many of you were believers in 1977 just a few y'all want to took a rapture and we'd have been here thank God thank God y'all mixed it thank God Jose revelation wasn't that good right ray Louise what were you born move well I'd tell brother Anderson to move but he's a lot older some 1980 good grief we were almost having kids no never mind whatever kidding this I got shoes as old as you boot hunting boots mm-hmm I did about him in 1980 I bought Gander Mountain had the first catalogue that I bought hunting boots in 1980 still got well Nathaniel Brenes got them alright so here we go under the fifth seal there's a few things that happen let's get back to what we were talking about cuz watch this that's why brother Dale said that to me the other day and it kind of struck my heart just a little bit right here look to me there's four things that happen in this fifth seal that is the Thunder because the Thunder is the voice of God when he reveals the seal to you not the time now listen let's be just let's be brutally honest a fifth seal Jew is not gonna have anything to do with your redemption in that you understand now they have something to do with the total plan of redemption but just knowing the fifth seal Jew was Jews that were not given eternal life until after they died that's not going to hurt or make your salvation any better or worse everybody got that young what I'm saying is I'm not doing away with it by no means so this is a piece of the puzzle but the Thunder under that seal you remember brother Bramson marriage and divorce was revealed in the seal where was it revealed we just got finished with it this sale Jesus Christ was married to Israel and she did what she did she what she committed fornication and remember the only way you can put your wife away even now is because of fornication you can put her away and marry again and be right so Jesus cut America Jehovah I am couldn't put him away and then for no reason he had to have a reason they went prostituting their self and then in the spiritual realm so the not even the children of Israel but Jews right they went whoring they committed spiritual adultery against God their husband and he put him away and he and he by law by his own law he can marry again so who did he take he took a Gentile bride and that was right so so the the grace of marriage and divorce to me is revealed in the fifth seal because it is great it is great because look have you ever thought about this you know and that's what we got to go back to the new birth if your old husband is still alive and you try to marry Christ you can't do that you are committing adultery but if your old husband is dead sisters if your if your husband's passed away you're just as free to marry you was a day you were a virgin well what grace but that's grace to you and me in the spiritual realm thank God don't hold that against us it's putting a sea of God's forgive one that's never to be remembered again when that old husband dies he can't remember that you are the virtuous endless proud of you how can you be a virgin and have been married before but if your old husband's dead you're just as virgin as you were when you first was born in God's eyes so the grace of marriage in divorce also what else predestination comes in view those fifth seal Jew are predestinated right it's not all jewelry no it's the ones that come in under martyrdom we read that remember like brother daily now we're talking about it's not all Jews come on get that out of your head not every Jew that died is in the fifth seal the fifth field you is a martyr someone that is killed because they are a Jew no other reason I'll read it to you in just a minute so there's predestination Daniel 70 weeks to me is made more clear because of this fill this seal and then also as we were talking about the other day the total plan of redemption comes into view right here in this fifth seal but you gotta say that you gotta see not that the fifth seal Jew was was was Jews that were killed and then they got eternal life and that is grave but you got to see the things that happens to you under that seal that thunders what the voices got to speak to you that Thunder never spoke listen to me that Turner never spoke in 1963 but to one man and to be real honest with you you okay okay be real honest brother Colley this don't don't hold your heart be as old as you are sometimes you need to okay alright man don't be done all this out here man scared me for a minute I knew it gonna pick you up but I have you but the total plan of redemption has never been fully understood until this day even in 1963 they listen folks they did not understand the seals you know why cuz we're still here 60 years later listen when we get a total revelation am i right we get when they open and we all come together under this revelation of all the seals being opened the Seventh Seal listen we're heading toward that I am we know he's here but that seventh seal what brings him back to her ever-present sure he never left but he's going to materialize he's not gonna be standing here but he's gone materializing you mean a man so that's what we're heading towards but when that's revealed to you we're going our body it's like it's like brother Jason was saying it's not something you gotta fight and twist and pull it's already in you the I am is there we've just got one step into that step into that moment of a body change but listen we got to have all this before we can you see that big old foundation down there called faith brother Brown said faith alone though won't do it what he said faith alone and I say faith alone is not gonna do it I believe I believe well there's a lot of people believe but what do you believe that's right you gotta believe the right thing you got to believe that what thank you listen if this isn't individual affair with God you go around all day saying I am I am I am but anyway let's look at this just for a second there by okay it kind of hot mm-hmm so now let's look here's the dang of 70 weeks just in them just in a nutshell here we were talking about this the other day I'm gonna put this right here so they had 70 years in captivity and brother Brown said that the 70 years 70 weeks of Daniel covered well we know it was seven 62 and seven that makes well one week not stable seven years one week make 70 nobody got that everybody got that that's the 70 weeks of Daniel now you and I are not in that told us the 70 weeks of Daniel juice okay right so we're not in that we're not in that plan of redemption according to the 70 weeks of Daniel that's the way it's supposed to look because in the Bible I seem like this after brother Dale said that in the Daniel 70 weeks Bible are in the Bible with Daniel 9:24 there is no no mention of a break everybody okay listen there was no mention of a Gentile coming in there was no mention of a break there was mention of this being the olive tree there were seventy weeks determined sixty-two then you had Calvary now if they would have sat to them at Calvary what would happen I mean brother Dale was telling this other day now they would have now listen you can't go so far to say they would have a future home go that future home just for me and you especially for the bride of Jesus Christ but now what would they had they would have had a continuous millennium after that cuz watch after the 70 weeks of Daniel is over where are we going to millennium but they wouldn't went to the millennium and listen to this according to Scripture they never celebrated their FTS you believe they would have just had a continuous Jubilee they would have a continuous cycle for eternity wow man that opened up so much you oughta talk to you pastor something he might have you I am NOT happy if you listen but that's what would happen and we weren't included in that so there's the plan of redemption for the Jews amen but there had to be a fifth sealed you call this in the Bible there had to be 144,000 call this in the Bible and there had to be a Gentile bride because that's in the Bible it just wasn't in Daniel so now with the complete plan of redemption under the showing the fifth seal shows he what he divorced Israel and we were talking about this other day he didn't divorce him back here cuz remember he kept telling him he kept what do you do they go into Mindi's and jason will mate what's covering the last things were done man they'd go into bondage right then they'd go out of bondage garcy I'm gonna put you in bondage and then they said well I'm gonna bring you out with a mighty hand I'm gonna put you back into bondage for 70 years but now after 70 years I'm gonna bring you back out in and out hit it outright hidden the end in other words wipe him off but when he come to Calvary that's the only time he took his Gentile bride so he had to divorce him at Calvary he didn't divorce him back in the Old Testament he'd abort and remember Calvary was during the time of the Old Testament anyway so we are talking about the Old Testament but he didn't divorce him if he would have divorced them he didn't ever give him a chance he said you're done no he kept saying I'm gonna put you in captivity if you'll do this I'll bring you out if you keep doing this I'll bring all the way to Calvary even in Calvary's what'd he say Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing but he had when he came back on the day of pentecost yeah it was to a small group of Jews but this began that break of that wild olive tree that was seven church ages to take you and me so there we entered into the plan of redemption on the earth God knew this all in his head but he had to wait till he divorced and when they turned him down brother Brown said they made their fatal mistake at Calvary in the day of 70 weeks book they made their fatal mistake he divorced her and married listen when he come back on the day of Pentecost he married a hundred and twenty little Jesus's our little bride he and yeah sure they were Jews and there were some Jews that were saved but that's that lap over that we've been talking about he had to bring them out but what he doing in just a few years Paul said I believe God's had enough of you and I've had enough of you my brother Dale said even in the Daniel 70 weeks book brother Branham says God kept dealing with the Jews all right up to Titus when he destroyed the destroyed Jerusalem so there was your lap over there was a little lap over right in here of from AD 30 to 80 70 he still tried to deal with him he's got grace more than will ever accept but then finally Paul said lo I turned to the Gentiles I'm going after a bride not a nation individuals and who went after him Paul who's gonna go to the Gentiles that's exactly who when you wasn't saved by Paul you wasn't saved by brother Branham you were saved by the I am a man they're by all rights a man but in divorcing her right in here come a fifth seal Jew that would have not come had this not happened there's no fifth seal Jew if God just went straight right to the Jews and saved them all and took him in the rapture there would have been no me and you so now what happened you got the Old Testament Saints now look he divorced him he didn't kill him he divorced him he put him away but now you got to remember if you cover everybody like Isaiah Abraham Moses hello you cover all them and say well they were lost you're wrong there was an Old Testament people that were saved because of that happening at Calvary even though he divorced them even though they turned him down there was a group there that was in paradise a man that was in paradise waiting for Calvary because they couldn't be eradicated of sin the blood of bulls and goats covered since so God made a provision in the Old Testament to just slide them over in a little in a little place called paradise don't have to worry about the devil anymore but they couldn't go right straight up because the blood of bulls and goats listen when samuel came back up when the Witch of Endor brought Samuel up listen everybody when the Witch of Endor brought Samuel up brother Browne said that only could happen in the Old Testament under the blood of bulls it goes he said that can't happen now and then but when he brought Sam no up he looked just like he did when he died I'm gonna tell you something real plain if you die as they believer you will not ever be seen in the condition you died in amen but Samuel was so well known till the wits of endor said oh my goodness what have I done brother Brown said Samuel had on his what his mantle and he knew who Simon wasn't Samuel even said hey must have been able to get into this dimension he said hey Saul you may have a problem but you fix him to be with me tomorrow you're gonna fall in battle and in tomorrow you're gonna be with me in paradise and then so old Saul made it to old Saul was in that Old Testament Saint group which will be given eternal life part of it part of the power of redemption he's gonna save them all now listen ain't gonna say it listen when I say save them all they don't mean everybody I don't think bail is gonna be there I don't think all them real evil judges and kings from Israel are gonna be there no it's just gonna be the elect it's gonna be the ones that what in their heart God knows your heart God knows their heart God knows David's heart David David was a man after God's own heart he what he knew that if they listened if David would have been sitting here today you talking about him doing the dance when he danced when the when the tabernacle or when the Holy of Holies came back in he embarrassed his poor wife bless her heart but he danced for hours you don't think if he wasn't sitting here today with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you couldn't keep him in this building why because he saw the Ark of God now that Ark of God came in here with you today why can't you be happy [Applause] God allowed it but he never wanted to hiding those badger skins he wanted to hide in your skin here we got a plan of redemption the Old Testament you got the fifth seal Judas killed you've got the Gentile bride that's coming in here and then this right here you've still got I'm gonna write it down but you've got foolish virgin you've got cup of water in my name being good to the bride that's gonna go into eternity and they're no different from the fifth cells you almost because the fifth tells you didn't get eternal life here those people that are good to you they're not gonna get eternal life here they're gonna get eternal life there that's a watch on judgment but then you got another group you got 144,000 to finish Daniels 70 ways he has not forget to juice so there's everybody's gonna be safe that covers the whole plan of redemption Old Testament Saints okay from Adam to here 50 old you why I mean really if if fields use a mystery to me it's not anymore but it's a mystery to most people because most people even brother branham thought that fifth seal Jew being so mysterious in so given white robes he thought that was the Gentile bride because of the position they held they had white robe though they were given white robes but mother though what the mystery that opened up was that they were given eternal life after they died not even knowing Jesus Christ but no like brother now we're talking about when we come back in this millennium talk about a fifth seal Jew that's gonna follow you around talk about that man that got eternal life because they stopped and helped you on the side of the road don't even know nothing about God you're gonna walk in that Millennial temple and you're gonna say you see that that candlestick represented this that ladder represented this there's the Holy of Holies that's me cuz who's gonna anoint the temple and one more time who's gonna anoint the temple in the millennium absolutely remember we're there on the honeymoon it's not even us not for us still seven-day no way day not the future home that's future homes sitting around here today but we're scattered out sister Anna we're a city scattered but when we come into that millennium all the saints are gonna be right there together and then we're gonna just raise up off the breath of the earth and you know what that's only one man they can kill the devil and the little amps and the little junk that he puts on your shoulder that little thing that's God God will kill Souls God will take care of the devil and all those little imps of his and then you and I are gonna come right back down and John said I saw a bride coming to the city coming down as a bride adorned for a husband that's not the Millennium that's the future home the millennium is to the Jews and what a great time v sealed you heathen all even the 144,000 don't get they get the plan of redemption but they don't get the complete plan they get preached Jesus for three and a half years that's all they get and you know what I'm sure the two witnesses are probably gonna say now there was a bride that you miss but he's gonna meet us it's not gonna be here say it'll be a personal it'll be people walking in and and the two witnesses are gonna go there they are remember that big group that John saw what is it revelation is nine or someone there we saw this great big group that no man could number come walking in who's gonna come walking in thank you there by right with that say I am but that's the pleat complete plan of redemption that's God's grace because remember Israel was God's children first wife wife wife that was his wife I read you the scripture I'm married to you amen but because of grace and because the opening of the seals we can see this happen and then we can walk in the reality of it I want you to listen to this we're going to read this and then we'll close brother Joe if you would let them get back to the very last thing as of invisible union I'm gonna skip all that we've read it before don't have to read it again about about grace so losing brother Branham says many times talk about Amazing Grace His grace provided robes in the fifth seal let's read this right here invisible Union I won't tell you what a prophet prophesied of a group of people but you and I are the reality of that invisible Union paragraph 229 that very last quote you'll have to skip all the way down let's give them just a second hey bye alright say man how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you came after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you were born an adulteress oh brother branham that heard but it's the truth you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it you had no no you it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before that where was that gene in you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book alive because listen folks listen to me one second who wrote the seals not John Jesus Christ preached him in Matthew John just wrote what he saw he just wrote look it he just wrote the seal part he'd get all that it went for him I'm just telling you what brother I'm saying it was for you folks it was for you you not another group and you know what don't go out that door where you know stuff that you may drown in this water we've been getting please let's don't pray for rain wettest year on record last year set of 71 inches of rain and we usually get 45 to 50 goodness gracious but you know what it's been raining inside - I believe I believe it's been raining inside cuz who's been setting this building getting it oh boy that's pretty good invincible Union brought a crop where we went Friday - that night I got I got a sermon when I am will preaching just a little while - but a little bit later hey the bridegroom took away your shame and put you in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for Danes you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church target says no I don't sell right does it no you might find that in the Almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of water by the word in the word by the you were standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now that was a Thanksgiving message he preached in Shreveport Louisiana on Thanksgiving Day that was his Thanksgiving a message he said as you as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing listen big it word if if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every a man every jot every tittle where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shots I'm trying to tell us pull away from this carnal reform of having to do all these rituals and get out here in the week where you can get right before they s o n I hear the coming of the combine that was 1965 you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a things given I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the side of the Living God who is thank you every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how can you if a man if I was supposed to die just keep going if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that I might become him the word they meant let me hold true to that not to church the word all that spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh it's becoming word and the word is becoming flesh is that happening to who's going to come to that manifested vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's cumulating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place now I couldn't even keep up with it weirdy going to desert get the seal we're near the coming of jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes the word call of the holy spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a signing daughter of God now we know that's by foreknowledge you know that we've been taught well here you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away you can't divorce the devil because you're a female remember you females can't divorce your husband under the marriage and divorce you cannot divorce your husband if you got a live-in husband you're committing adultery same way with this now remember that's Grace I'm just talking like this right here and your old book of divorcement foot away know what it's dead not just divorce it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God do you know what that means that God never knew you were married to the devil you did your neighbor might I knew it the old girlfriends boyfriends guy you went to the bar with probably knew it still knows it but I ain't worried about them I just want him not to know him and I'm just telling you what he said cuz who's he talking to okay cuz look even in the mind of God you're the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he is washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the Father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God called love there's only one person that knows true love and that's the bride of Jesus Christ remember brother Branham said the only true love on this earth today it's like brother Jason I love what he was talking about he said he said people say I don't want to join that old message Church and they're so bound and they're so you know they're just yeah just you know y'all just put under all kind of pressure and do this and don't do that he said let him get born again one time he said I told somebody said you're out there in the world and you say you're free you're doing everything the devil tells you to do you not free he said but he said when you come into Christianity he said you're still not free he saw no I've got Liberty that's difference in liberty and freedom cuz I'm not no don't let me be free Paul said I am now a prisoner of Christ if you are in love we it's like brother Jason said he said there's several billion women in this world today he said there's only one woman that I'm bound to him and that's my wife I'm not bound to no other woman but he said I love to be bound to that woman I love to be bound to that woman Jim right here [Laughter] [Applause] see what's he get for sitting up here close you get sent up here with the religious people are now that's just where the fire follows up there brother dick I know that but not really that's the way God things to you though take that really you're bound to him a love slave the Prophet even says you're a love slave to your wife if you and your wife are truly married My heavens I don't get me started on that grief it's the best thing besides
