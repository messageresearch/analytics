[4:00] sunday service lord willing
[4:02] and uh try to get back to some sort of
[4:04] normalcy so
[4:05] first john four before we get started i
[4:09] was back there talking to brother joe
[4:12] and
[4:13] and we know this uh this coveted thing
[4:16] is
[4:17] in places getting worse and i know where
[4:20] several
[4:21] um message ministers this week have
[4:24] passed away
[4:25] from the disease and or the virus
[4:28] whatever you want to call it
[4:29] and then a couple other we've lost four
[4:31] ministers this week from different
[4:32] things besides covet but some of it was
[4:35] covered related
[4:36] some of them we knew some of them we did
[4:38] not know but
[4:40] we need to keep everybody in our prayers
[4:44] there's a brother james west i know some
[4:46] of you that
[4:47] that go to brother matthew braves with
[4:50] us every once in a while he was a
[4:52] dear friend of ours and just a a
[4:55] huggy bear of a guy you know really nice
[4:57] gentleman
[4:58] he passed away today now i don't know if
[5:00] it was covered related or not but
[5:02] but he passed away today too so just
[5:04] keep everybody in your prayers we
[5:06] we're going to win this thing we will
[5:09] win don't worry
[5:10] we'll win doesn't matter what signs look
[5:12] like
[5:13] remember signs follow believers we've
[5:15] got to be believers first
[5:17] we become believers first and then the
[5:19] signs will follow us
[5:20] not bad signs that's what we're going to
[5:22] talk about tonight this thing
[5:24] got so intertwined until the devil got a
[5:26] little bit complacent but in the end
[5:28] time guess what's going to happen
[5:30] it's going to get separated there's
[5:32] going to be a book that's not closed
[5:34] anymore it's going to separate
[5:36] and when it's separated when the seals
[5:39] opened
[5:40] it showed who the devil was where he was
[5:42] at and what he was doing but it also
[5:44] showed where jesus christ was
[5:46] and what he was doing and who he was
[5:47] doing it through hey man i enjoyed
[5:50] all the preaching back last weekend
[5:52] brother um
[5:54] brother whitley did a good job too
[5:55] because that's this thing's got to come
[5:57] from the bride it's not going to come
[5:58] from anybody else it's not going to come
[6:00] from
[6:00] nominal people it's not going to come
[6:02] from even good foolish virgins that's
[6:04] not where the call is coming from the
[6:05] calls coming from the bride
[6:08] that's it and i didn't i didn't make
[6:11] this plan god did
[6:12] all right we just got to decide to be in
[6:14] the plan jim was reading me something
[6:17] uh today about uh a digging a hole was
[6:20] it god what was it
[6:23] god was afraid yeah
[6:26] don't be leaning on the shovel and pray
[6:28] for a hole and expect for god to just
[6:29] give you a hold i've always told you if
[6:31] you're looking for a job
[6:32] don't sit on your couch with a coca-cola
[6:34] in your hand with your feet up on the
[6:35] couch and say god
[6:37] send me somebody and knock on the door
[6:39] give me a job no say something you got
[6:41] to do
[6:42] there's something you need to do you
[6:44] need listen
[6:46] the prophet of god even paul said press
[6:48] your way
[6:50] right i press toward the goal now how
[6:53] many of us are really pressing
[6:57] because pressing causes pressure
[7:02] i believe we're trying to we're fixing
[7:03] to make the devil real mad
[7:06] because he's not going to know how to
[7:07] handle us when we get toward this end
[7:09] time
[7:09] right as we're talking about here
[7:11] tonight when those seals open
[7:14] brother brown said we've got satan's
[7:15] answer right amen
[7:17] what's the answer we know where he's at
[7:19] what he's doing what his tactics are
[7:21] and what is going to happen at the end
[7:24] amen
[7:25] amen so first john 4
[7:28] because listen how many people have you
[7:31] ever talked to that knows exactly how
[7:34] the end time is going to end up
[7:37] they don't know that's right jesus is
[7:39] coming soon he's coming down
[7:41] out of the eastern sky he's coming in
[7:42] this he's coming on that he's coming
[7:44] this he's the pope
[7:45] he's coming this way he's coming that
[7:46] way he's not coming for another 50 years
[7:48] he's coming tomorrow he's coming yes
[7:49] you understand what i mean but you and i
[7:51] will know
[7:53] right surely we know where he's at
[7:57] surely we know where he's at so we ought
[7:59] to know what he's fixing to start doing
[8:01] like i said before we may not know
[8:03] what's going to go on this year but that
[8:05] holy ghost inside of you
[8:07] knows your journey all the way to the
[8:08] very end so let's start listening to
[8:10] that thing inside of us
[8:13] listen to that still small voice and
[8:16] he'll tell us what to do
[8:18] to get us out here because he promised
[8:20] he would
[8:21] he promised he'd never leave us never
[8:24] forsake us
[8:25] amen so let's bow our heads the only
[8:27] father thank you for this evening that
[8:28] we have
[8:30] to worship you one more time in spirit
[8:32] and truth lord gathering the bride
[8:33] together lord
[8:35] in this building father and without you
[8:38] here
[8:39] it's just a meeting the lord i pray that
[8:41] you'll come and anoint
[8:43] our lips lord move us aside
[8:46] you take over be the active participant
[8:48] in this service
[8:49] but also lord you're the only one that
[8:51] can reveal and as we're going to read
[8:53] here a few minutes
[8:55] what we we live for revelation
[8:59] and it only can come from you lord we
[9:01] pray that you'd give us revelation more
[9:03] and more this year than we've ever had
[9:04] before
[9:05] that you'll give us prophetic insight
[9:08] into the things that are coming
[9:10] to this world lord and know that there's
[9:12] a separation time that we're
[9:14] truly we are separated from this world
[9:16] as far as the worldly pleasures of the
[9:18] world but lord we still have to live
[9:20] here
[9:21] but there's going to come a time where
[9:22] we're going to have to make a decision
[9:24] even as the 68 million martyrs in the
[9:27] dark ages made a decision lord they
[9:29] walked into those arenas
[9:31] to death in the body well we're going to
[9:33] have to die out lord to ourself
[9:36] and then the world is going to persecute
[9:39] us and prosecute us
[9:40] but lord you said that we would overcome
[9:43] all right so we trust in what you're
[9:45] saying lord we believe what you're
[9:47] saying
[9:48] we believe you're you've already said it
[9:50] already done it so now
[9:51] let's walk into it father forgive us of
[9:54] our sins
[9:55] thank you for the time we've had lord we
[9:57] pray that you give us more of that in
[9:58] jesus name we pray
[10:00] amen let's have a good time in the lord
[10:03] amen
[10:04] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[10:06] the spirits for the layer of god
[10:09] because many false prophets are going
[10:10] out into the world hereby know you the
[10:12] spirit of god
[10:13] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[10:15] christ has come in the flesh is of god
[10:17] and every spirit that confesses not that
[10:19] jesus christ has come in the flesh it's
[10:21] not of god
[10:23] because they'll they'll they'll say well
[10:25] yeah we we got the holy ghost but we
[10:27] can't control our flesh
[10:29] we got the holy ghost but you're a
[10:32] sinner and i'm a sinner we're
[10:33] we're just all nobody's perfect uh
[10:36] that's not what my bible says
[10:38] amen and every spirit that confesses not
[10:40] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[10:42] is not of god
[10:43] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[10:46] now there's your spirit of antichrist
[10:48] it's that jesus christ has not come in
[10:49] the flesh
[10:51] but remember he's hidden and revealed in
[10:54] you
[10:55] as brother william will say he's hidden
[10:57] and revealed in you
[11:00] that's one of the great mysteries to me
[11:02] that is the great mystery but it took a
[11:04] profit to come in the end time
[11:06] and say now i call you bride i have
[11:08] brought eliezer has brought isaac and
[11:11] rebecca together
[11:13] and he stepped out of the way and let
[11:16] isaac and rebecca
[11:18] consummate the marriage amen so that's
[11:20] what we're looking at now the
[11:21] consummation of this whole thing
[11:24] because we're going to a wedding supper
[11:27] year of god wait a minute this is that
[11:30] spirit of antichrist whereof you have
[11:31] heard about it come
[11:34] now we've heard about it the world has
[11:36] their idea who the antichrist is just
[11:38] punch in antichrist sometime and just
[11:40] read about who they think the antichrist
[11:42] is
[11:43] it's everybody but who we know it is but
[11:45] you know who that's telling feeding them
[11:46] that information it's not god
[11:49] because the bible says as i read you
[11:51] last week that he will
[11:52] let you believe a lie and be damned by
[11:56] him
[11:57] he'll let you god will let you believe
[12:00] lie because he knows you'll not believe
[12:01] anything else
[12:02] because you're an unbeliever all right
[12:04] so this is that spirit of antichrist and
[12:06] even now already is in the world
[12:08] year of god little children have
[12:10] overcome them
[12:11] because greater heed us in you than he
[12:13] that's in the world
[12:15] they are of the world therefore speak
[12:16] they of the world and the world heareth
[12:18] them
[12:18] we are of god well that's pretty see now
[12:20] that separates
[12:22] like brother brown said even back during
[12:24] the segregation time he
[12:26] he probably ruffled a few feathers he
[12:28] said god's a segregationist
[12:31] and everybody's like whoa we know we
[12:33] didn't no god is a segregationist he has
[12:35] always said do not go over here and do
[12:37] that with this group of people
[12:39] told israel do not go to the world
[12:40] telling us not to mingle with the world
[12:42] he even tells us not to mingle with
[12:44] somebody with false doctrine
[12:46] right right oh my goodness
[12:49] they went out from us because they
[12:51] wasn't of us amen
[12:53] we are of god he that knoweth god
[12:54] heareth us he that is not of god
[12:56] heareth not us hereby know we now look
[12:58] how positive that is
[13:01] hereby know we this is john
[13:04] the revelator that went to the isle of
[13:06] patmos and saw all the church ages
[13:08] saw all the the the woman on the white
[13:12] on the red dragon and you saw the
[13:14] woman in the sun and he saw all these
[13:16] great mysteries
[13:17] and he comes back and he says i've seen
[13:20] it
[13:21] i may not complace it all but i've seen
[13:23] that that there's this woman sitting on
[13:25] a scarlet beast that's got a
[13:27] a vial full of full of blood of the
[13:30] martyrs of the saints i know there's
[13:32] something going to happen
[13:34] in the end time there's going to be a
[13:35] separation time all right
[13:38] we are of god he that knoweth here he
[13:39] that knoweth god heareth us he that is
[13:41] not of god here if not us
[13:43] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[13:46] the spirit of error how positive that is
[13:47] you may be seated
[13:49] and i'm going to continue on i read went
[13:51] back and read first john again and i
[13:52] picked up a good little nugget right
[13:54] here let's go to first john 5 verse 18.
[13:57] look how positive john is we know not we
[14:02] think we think this is not no
[14:06] we know that whosoever is born of god
[14:10] sinneth not whoa that's a mouthful
[14:13] but he knew and he saw you know what
[14:16] that's the same guy that wrote over
[14:18] there in revelations that she will be
[14:20] without spot
[14:22] and without wrinkle a bride
[14:26] that will be in revelations 19 adorned
[14:28] in white
[14:29] raiment no sin at all
[14:34] but he that is begotten of god keepeth
[14:37] himself not that he that's begotten of
[14:38] mama and daddy
[14:40] he that's begotten of what the mother
[14:43] and father the new jerusalem the ones
[14:45] that are born from above
[14:47] he that is begotten of god keepeth
[14:50] himself now watch
[14:51] and that wicked one toucheth him
[14:55] not right you say oh my the devil just
[14:59] touches me every day yeah he does but it
[15:01] should have no effect on you
[15:04] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[15:07] but right here he says
[15:08] that wicked one toucheth him not and
[15:12] we know that well here we go again and
[15:14] we know
[15:15] that we're of god do you know that today
[15:19] amen do you know that you come from god
[15:21] and you're going back to god do you know
[15:23] that you've been born again
[15:25] amen do we know that we are and we know
[15:28] that we are of god
[15:30] and the whole world
[15:34] life in wickedness wow
[15:37] because listen if you're not born again
[15:38] today
[15:41] you're dead you're lost you're in the
[15:44] world you're of the world you say no i'm
[15:45] in a message church that's the worst
[15:48] if you're not born again that's the
[15:49] worst place to be right
[15:52] and we know that the son of god has come
[15:57] and hath given us what that's what i
[15:59] want to key on today an
[16:01] understanding
[16:03] you can only separate something if you
[16:06] have an understanding
[16:08] of both spirits amen
[16:11] because you got to be one or the other
[16:13] can't be in between
[16:16] one or the other that we may know him
[16:19] that is true
[16:20] and we are in him that is true so what
[16:23] does that make you
[16:24] true even in his son jesus christ this
[16:28] is the true god
[16:31] there's a false one but this is the true
[16:34] one
[16:35] and eternal life everybody got that say
[16:38] amen
[16:39] to me that's a powerful powerful we know
[16:43] john said we know we know where it's
[16:45] coming from
[16:46] we know that whosoever is born of god
[16:48] sentence not number one let's keep
[16:50] reading this again as brother william
[16:51] read it the other night or brother
[16:53] bob read it sunday now remember this
[16:56] christ in the true church
[16:58] remember there's a false one it's a
[17:00] continuation of the book of acts that's
[17:04] why we
[17:04] baptize the name lord jesus christ
[17:06] that's why you saw brother branham you
[17:08] saw on the
[17:09] screen there how he he gives the
[17:11] prescription
[17:14] dr paul i mean dr peter stood up on the
[17:16] day of pentecost and gave you the
[17:17] prescription
[17:18] amen and it hadn't changed since man
[17:21] changed it
[17:22] when that vine started intertwining
[17:26] man changed it but not in the first
[17:28] church age he didn't
[17:30] amen but the book of revelation shows
[17:32] how that the antichrist spirit would
[17:34] come into the church
[17:35] and defile it make it lukewarm formal
[17:37] and powerless
[17:39] it exposes satan revealing his words the
[17:41] attempted destruction of god's people
[17:44] and the discrediting of god's word right
[17:46] down to the time he's cast in the lake
[17:47] of fire now that's his division
[17:50] there he's going to be kept and that's
[17:51] what i want to talk about today the two
[17:53] spirits have got to be divided somewhere
[17:55] down the line because this side is going
[17:59] to be tears and this side's going to be
[18:01] wheat
[18:01] there's no in between these are going to
[18:04] be burnt and send into torment these are
[18:06] going to go into eternal life
[18:08] now that's just the way it is i didn't
[18:09] make the plan but we're going to read
[18:10] here in matthew 13 when jesus said
[18:13] that there was a sower went out to sow
[18:15] and then there was a one so tares
[18:17] and he said you just let them all grow
[18:19] up see he had to wait till this last
[18:21] church age before he could separate them
[18:24] it was so intermingled down through the
[18:26] denominations and down through the
[18:28] other six church ages there had to come
[18:30] something in the end time
[18:31] to separate them and say this is that
[18:34] and this is that this is tears and this
[18:35] is wheat
[18:36] because as i've said before if you get a
[18:39] garden
[18:40] when that thing first comes out of the
[18:42] ground everything looks like corn
[18:44] everything looks like a bean but let it
[18:47] grow on up a little bit further
[18:49] and you'll see the cocoa bird start or
[18:51] you'll see the morning glory start or
[18:53] you it will be
[18:54] what it will expose itself all you gotta
[18:57] do is let it grow
[18:58] it will expose itself and that's what's
[19:01] happening now
[19:02] but what it exposes satan now when
[19:04] brother branham says
[19:05] it now i know he's talking about the
[19:09] word
[19:09] but that it is you tonight i want you to
[19:12] understand he's talking
[19:14] it will only it will necklace it will
[19:17] not come through one preacher
[19:20] that's done all right brother branham
[19:22] come leads are come he said here
[19:26] i call you bride i introduce you to
[19:29] christ
[19:30] the veil has been rent right have we not
[19:33] heard that before
[19:34] the veil's been rent come
[19:38] boldly to the throne of grace isaac and
[19:40] rebecca
[19:42] married under eleazar's teaching
[19:47] because he told rebecca so much about
[19:49] ellie about
[19:50] uh isaac until she didn't have to ask
[19:54] 25 different people in that field who
[19:56] isaac was
[19:58] eliezer had told her the very
[20:01] characteristic
[20:02] and listen there was no facebook there
[20:05] was
[20:06] no uh instagram there was no
[20:09] um with snapchat
[20:13] he did it by word he explained
[20:17] isaac so plain to
[20:21] rebecca to when she lit off that camel
[20:24] she went running to the first person she
[20:26] saw because she knew that's who that was
[20:28] and that's what the prophet of god did
[20:29] in the end time he did
[20:32] he did not introduce us to three
[20:34] different isaacs
[20:35] he didn't introduce us to isaac and his
[20:37] helper he didn't introduce us to isaac
[20:40] and his horsemen
[20:41] he introduced us to isaac he told us
[20:44] about isaac and he knew
[20:46] that we would go to the right person
[20:50] which is who jesus christ so it exposes
[20:53] satan revealing his word now keep going
[20:55] in the red he knows that if the people
[20:57] get the true revelation of the true
[20:59] church
[21:00] and what she is and what she stands for
[21:04] and that she can do the greater words
[21:06] not just she can see it
[21:08] she can do the greater work she will be
[21:11] an invincible
[21:12] invincible army if they get a true
[21:15] revelation
[21:16] they you
[21:20] nobody else is going to get a true
[21:22] revelation that's why i'm telling you
[21:24] revelations 10
[21:25] 7 has come so real to me glory
[21:28] we have read it and read it and it's one
[21:30] of our themes right
[21:32] it's one of them we get on our belt
[21:33] buckle yeah
[21:36] but do you really know what that thing's
[21:37] saying right in the days of the voice of
[21:40] the seventh angel when it begins to
[21:42] sound
[21:44] the mystery of god one mystery
[21:47] will be finished what is the mystery of
[21:49] god you and me
[21:51] you and me are the mystery that satan
[21:53] won't be able to handle
[21:55] he's got all that other
[21:58] remember the prophet of god said we he
[22:00] now have satan's
[22:01] answer don't let him beat you up we have
[22:05] it we have the answer
[22:07] to keep him separated from us amen
[22:10] she will be an invincible army if they
[22:12] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[22:14] within the framework of the christian
[22:16] church
[22:17] the intertwining and by god's spirit
[22:19] deserve to withstand the antichrist
[22:21] spirit satan will be what
[22:23] powerless now what does satan want to do
[22:26] he wants to kill you
[22:29] he'll soon see you physically dead
[22:32] doesn't matter about your soul he wants
[22:35] you dead he wants you out of the way
[22:38] so you don't do him any more harm and
[22:40] you don't stand in his way
[22:42] so you don't know we're coming down the
[22:45] road today you don't know
[22:46] how many times within seconds you could
[22:49] have had a wreck
[22:50] within minutes you could have been run
[22:52] over and all these different things
[22:54] going on
[22:57] and here's those angels
[23:02] sitting on top of your car and they're
[23:06] going
[23:08] move back but you know what though
[23:10] they're not just angels out there
[23:12] there's demons out there and if we could
[23:16] see the fight that goes on
[23:19] around us
[23:23] we would be astonished at what god is
[23:25] doing for us
[23:27] just by us living and breathing every
[23:29] day of our life
[23:30] because look at those four ministers
[23:32] they're gone off the scene sure they're
[23:34] bright
[23:34] sure there but but they're not preaching
[23:36] that you understand what i mean they're
[23:38] not furthering the gospel anymore
[23:40] right
[23:44] but here we are and we're still alive
[23:48] and we better do it this year we better
[23:50] preach the hardest we've ever preached
[23:51] we better you better dig the hardest
[23:53] you've ever done
[23:54] because you know what we're at least one
[23:56] year closer to the coming of the lord
[23:59] amen at least one year closer whatever
[24:01] he does when he does come we're one day
[24:03] one year closer
[24:05] to the coming of the lord so now let's
[24:08] go
[24:08] i know the next thing says what is truth
[24:09] but we got to go back into eden because
[24:11] eden is where this thing
[24:12] intertwined together and all the false
[24:15] doctrines began where
[24:17] in genesis prophet of god tells us
[24:20] you had nimrod you well you had cain and
[24:22] abel for one thing you had the serpent
[24:24] and adam the whole world the whole world
[24:29] is deceived in the book of genesis
[24:33] genesis 1 26 they think that's just man
[24:39] that's not just man that's the bride of
[24:42] jesus christ that's
[24:43] that's god's children that came into
[24:46] being at that point
[24:47] then you see that the world has now been
[24:49] taught that it was an
[24:51] apple that evade they're deceived right
[24:54] there in the beginning and don't you
[24:55] think it gets any better
[24:57] it gets worse as you go through
[25:00] because as god is hiding himself in
[25:02] simplicity
[25:04] so is the devil and they're intertwining
[25:07] or the the seed has been sown remember
[25:10] the two seeds started in the two trees
[25:12] in genesis
[25:13] and i read you the quote where they're
[25:15] planted in the same earth
[25:17] right they get the same rain right but
[25:19] they've intertwined so much
[25:21] until you can't hardly tell the
[25:23] difference
[25:26] oh my that's close yes sir it's close
[25:31] and it's going to get closer but there
[25:34] will come folks a separation time
[25:37] there will come a time when it's like i
[25:40] said before many times it
[25:42] if the if the nominal church which
[25:44] brother brown i read you a quote talking
[25:46] about them going into that world council
[25:48] of churches and going into that
[25:50] federation we see now
[25:53] as we see this political thing playing
[25:55] out we see now more how that there's
[25:56] going to be a group over here and
[25:57] there's going to be a group over here
[25:59] and it's going to be a group over here
[26:01] and this group is going to push their
[26:02] will on this group over here
[26:04] and brother brown says that if you don't
[26:07] watch it
[26:09] you're going to get caught in it right
[26:12] you'll get caught in that thing and
[26:13] can't get out why because
[26:16] they're going to close little church
[26:17] down but if you'll just
[26:20] don't don't talk don't don't mention
[26:22] that brandon man's name that just
[26:24] it just you know what it does it stirs
[26:25] the devil up
[26:28] but but you know then mo some preachers
[26:30] are going to go well
[26:31] because brother brown said to in other
[26:33] words to save face in other words to
[26:34] have being able to have church service
[26:36] we'll just go along with it
[26:37] that's compromising folks we're not
[26:39] going to do that amen
[26:42] abel didn't compromise with cain that's
[26:44] what killed abel
[26:45] right abel stood there and said this is
[26:48] what god said
[26:49] cain said no come on it's got to be the
[26:51] fruit it made him so mad he killed abel
[26:54] because abel stood
[26:56] on what he believed so did
[26:59] 68 million christians
[27:03] die at the hands of christians
[27:09] they said you don't believe this certain
[27:11] doctrine right here then we're going to
[27:12] kill you
[27:14] isn't that getting familiar and like
[27:16] brother brown said
[27:17] it's not so much as now killing
[27:19] physically killing
[27:21] but killing a person's influence kills
[27:24] the person
[27:25] amen we've seen that happen many many
[27:28] times
[27:29] but from the first age to now or even
[27:32] and going through nicea
[27:33] this thing is intertwined so much until
[27:36] like i said before and
[27:37] you bring it up here says when i
[27:39] preached on what is truth
[27:41] i looked on the internet and there's 30
[27:43] 000 worldwide christian organizations
[27:46] christian not these offshoots of demons
[27:49] and all the
[27:50] uh anti-christ and all this stuff
[27:52] there's 30 000 worldwide christian
[27:54] organizations
[27:55] there's 1200 different ones just in our
[27:58] 50 states
[28:00] 1200 different ways they see what god is
[28:04] and what he's doing oh
[28:05] yeah that's why brother branham said
[28:09] the true church one church
[28:13] and there's got to be one folks there's
[28:15] got to be a true church
[28:19] what is truth truth came to us
[28:22] by the opening of those seven seals
[28:27] first part of the ministry brother brown
[28:29] i'm sure he threw in all the different
[28:30] doctrines
[28:31] that they had fell from you heard him
[28:34] there pentecostal y'all went
[28:36] you know you let your women cut your
[28:37] hair you let your women preach or let
[28:38] your women do this
[28:40] he was telling him but when it come to
[28:42] the opening of those seals he said
[28:43] thousands of people will leave me
[28:47] thousands of my friends because see that
[28:51] was a defining moment
[28:54] i believe when christ and satan met each
[28:57] other
[28:58] now listen brother branham wasn't christ
[29:01] but he had christ in him
[29:02] and he had a job to do for christ
[29:07] but so did the denominational world
[29:08] because when he stepped out and said
[29:10] this is my revelation
[29:14] of these seven seals my revelation all
[29:17] the different ones we were talking to
[29:19] brother bob's house you know you got
[29:20] clarence larkin and all the ones they
[29:22] hit and missed but this man brought a
[29:24] full seven course message clarence
[29:28] larkin was a trinitarian so you can
[29:30] and forgive me he's a christian and i
[29:33] believe he made it
[29:34] he had some good teachings but you mark
[29:36] him off as being a true
[29:37] prophet of god everybody like sankey
[29:42] finney calvin you can name all that they
[29:44] had certain parts that they were
[29:47] but brother branham says one had to come
[29:50] to tie
[29:50] all the loose ends up because they had
[29:53] intertwined
[29:54] their self with trinitarianism so much
[29:57] and no in an eternal hell and mama's at
[30:00] the foot of jesus
[30:02] and you know and jesus is coming on a
[30:04] cloud
[30:05] and jesus is coming this way jesus is
[30:07] coming remember in 1917 they went up
[30:09] there on a
[30:10] uh went up there on the mountain or some
[30:12] campbell lights or whatever it was
[30:13] they figured out that's when jesus was
[30:16] coming
[30:18] but he was coming to them well that's
[30:21] been a long time ago
[30:23] all those other doctrines have been a
[30:25] long time ago we're here right now
[30:29] and like i said before the name of the
[30:31] this one is the end it's not just the
[30:33] end of the sermon it's the
[30:34] end of those two spirits
[30:38] one's going into perdition and one's
[30:40] going into glory
[30:42] there is no in between amen now sure i
[30:45] know there's
[30:46] people given eternal life you understand
[30:47] what i mean it's not it is cut and dry
[30:49] in god's mind
[30:51] but there are people going to be given
[30:52] eternal life for the different things
[30:54] you understand what i mean
[30:55] but they weren't true seed to begin with
[30:59] they were imparted eternal life they
[31:00] weren't part of that genesis 1 26 and 27
[31:03] man
[31:04] amen has everybody got that even the
[31:06] foolish virgin is not part of that
[31:07] genesis 1 26 and 27 men
[31:09] the only people that came from god
[31:13] is his children the only three children
[31:16] my daddy has in this building
[31:18] there's plenty of them in this building
[31:20] he's only got three
[31:21] because they came from him right so same
[31:24] way with god when he stood there and
[31:26] said let us make man in our own image
[31:27] after our likeness
[31:29] let him have dominion over the fish's
[31:30] sea and foul of the air and all the
[31:32] living creatures he was not talking
[31:33] about
[31:34] the billions of people that was going to
[31:36] come on the earth he was talking about
[31:38] one group of people
[31:40] but that group of people is going to
[31:42] have to realize that
[31:44] she has a purpose
[31:48] just as god had a plan and a purpose
[31:50] guess who it was for
[31:51] right now
[31:54] it wasn't for god god's eternal
[31:58] god don't need nobody to exist right
[32:01] but he wants to work through you to
[32:03] prove to the devil
[32:04] that he can do it because the devil got
[32:07] in the garden of eden he said boy i
[32:09] really messed this plant up
[32:11] they're gonna have to look to me they're
[32:14] going to have to look to my
[32:15] intelligence to be able to survive
[32:21] remember those people that came from
[32:24] cain
[32:25] brother brown said they were they were
[32:27] workers of
[32:28] iron they built the tower of babel they
[32:30] were always in
[32:31] in pearl uh seth was sheep herders
[32:36] common farmers amen and the devil was
[32:39] going i'll build my kingdom down here
[32:41] well he's trying
[32:42] to build one but you know what he's
[32:44] trying to build it the wrong way
[32:47] if he would have got on god's side and
[32:49] stayed his right hand man
[32:51] he could have had part of the kingdom
[32:53] but that part of the kingdom is now mine
[32:55] and yours amen that's mine
[32:58] and yours not his he forfeited all that
[33:03] he's just a squatter he owns nothing
[33:06] this powerful thing we call the devil
[33:08] one day we're going to look at him the
[33:09] bible says there's some drunk on the
[33:11] side of the road
[33:12] dying in his own vomit and say is this
[33:15] the man
[33:16] that's right now up in washington dc
[33:18] that's right now over in belgium that's
[33:20] right now over all these different
[33:21] places
[33:22] ruling the world only
[33:26] temporary
[33:29] but are we temporary do we have a
[33:33] promise just to be temporary
[33:35] we have a promise to own this thing for
[33:38] an eternity
[33:40] it was made in the beginning for me and
[33:42] you
[33:44] wasn't me for the devil
[33:49] come on people you got to start
[33:50] realizing who you are
[33:54] if we don't we don't just keep getting
[33:55] brow beat by the devil all the time
[33:59] what is truth 1200 different things in
[34:02] the united states alone
[34:04] no one truth right right
[34:08] there's a spirit of truth and the spirit
[34:09] of error them twelve hundred
[34:11] i'm sorry those eleven hundred and
[34:13] ninety nine
[34:14] are error there's only one truth
[34:19] first john 4 verse 3 he says and every
[34:21] spirit that confesses not that jesus
[34:22] christ is coming in the flesh is not of
[34:24] god this is one we read it first but i'm
[34:25] going to read it again but look
[34:27] that is that spirit of antichrist
[34:29] whereof you have heard
[34:30] that it should come and even now already
[34:33] is in the world
[34:34] so the antichrist spirit is here there
[34:36] is no doubt
[34:37] where it is it's right here
[34:41] it's not as the world says now see the
[34:44] world is looking and reading in
[34:45] revelations
[34:47] how the beast is going to rise up well
[34:50] is it going to be a horse is it going to
[34:51] be like dad said
[34:53] as my uncle used to think it would be
[34:55] this great big you know beast coming out
[34:57] of the
[34:57] out of the earth and well that's not
[34:59] going to deceive anybody
[35:01] that's a big beast and the whole world's
[35:03] gonna see it
[35:05] but he's gonna come in with flattery
[35:08] he's gonna come in and be real
[35:09] humble real calm see every time
[35:13] something rises up they'll go
[35:14] well that's antichrist the antichrist is
[35:16] doing this work
[35:18] the ant listen
[35:22] the antichrist is in them if they don't
[35:25] have jesus christ
[35:28] it's going to head up into one person we
[35:30] know that
[35:31] it's going to head up into one person
[35:33] one beast when we're out of here and we
[35:34] leave
[35:35] it's going to incarnate the pope and
[35:38] he's going to be the guy
[35:39] satan superman but until then
[35:42] he has an opposition
[35:46] that keeps that from happening and it's
[35:48] me and you
[35:50] thank you lord live so close to god
[35:53] satan won't know what to do with you wow
[35:56] see we got to start believing what's
[35:58] already been said about us we're not
[35:59] trying to develop a new revelation
[36:04] we're trying to believe the ones already
[36:05] said because we're not looking for a new
[36:08] bible i'm not looking for
[36:10] 10 new sermons from brother branham that
[36:11] they dig up out in arizona underneath a
[36:14] rock somewhere
[36:16] that's going to give us rapture and
[36:17] faith he said rapture and faith lies in
[36:20] these books and these tapes
[36:22] right here it's already here the book's
[36:25] open
[36:28] what are we looking for
[36:31] it's already here that's right
[36:36] opening of the book remember the book's
[36:39] been closed
[36:41] when the lamb took a book in revelation
[36:43] 5 it was closed
[36:47] but in revelation 10 7 the book was open
[36:51] and then he said in the days of the
[36:54] voice of the seventh angel when he
[36:56] begins to sound
[36:58] the mystery that's been closed up in
[37:01] that book
[37:03] will be made open amen
[37:07] we got to keep going and keep going and
[37:09] keep going
[37:10] because look i and i was i was listening
[37:12] to brother branham the other day and
[37:15] because you got to remember and we we
[37:18] covered it
[37:19] in the saying deed doctrine incarnate
[37:22] antichrist justification sanctification
[37:24] baptism holy ghost
[37:25] and incarnate christ you got four combat
[37:27] beasts
[37:28] well now that's the first four seals
[37:29] once those four combat beasts are gone
[37:31] so are we
[37:32] right does everybody realize that
[37:36] the work is done when those combat
[37:39] beasts leave this earth
[37:41] we're going with them they've done their
[37:44] job they have overcome those
[37:47] therion beasts are those untameable
[37:50] beasts that's going to be left on the
[37:51] earth but where
[37:53] is it we're looking you're looking at it
[37:56] right
[37:58] i know people get up and say well who's
[38:00] your worst enemy get up and look in the
[38:01] mirror well you know what
[38:02] that's your best friend too he might be
[38:06] your worst enemy but that guy down
[38:07] inside of you
[38:08] don't belittle him brothers and sisters
[38:11] that's the eternal god
[38:13] and that's the one you need to look at
[38:15] and say god i'm going forward i may look
[38:17] horrible i may make 100 mistakes today
[38:19] but at the end of the day
[38:23] the devil's going to know i walked on
[38:24] this earth one more day
[38:28] how many of you can do that all you got
[38:30] to do is pray and read your bible
[38:34] pray read your bible talk about god to
[38:37] your neighbor maybe
[38:39] how simple is that but saying he started
[38:42] as a little saying
[38:43] it became a deed it became a doctrine
[38:47] and then it became an incarnate
[38:49] antichrist which we're seeing in the end
[38:50] time now
[38:52] is heading up to one person it's a
[38:54] system
[38:56] saying deed doctrine so they have taken
[38:58] the whole doctrine it has intertwined
[39:00] and god has winked at the ignorance of
[39:03] those people
[39:04] down through the church ages because
[39:05] what there is true vine
[39:08] but that false vine had intertwined with
[39:11] doctrine father son holy ghost baptism
[39:14] eternal hell novenians and all the
[39:17] different things
[39:18] hey there's going to be catholics in
[39:19] heaven sorry about that
[39:22] they're going to be real true catholics
[39:24] in heaven they may not be bribed but
[39:26] buddy i'm telling you in that third and
[39:27] fourth church age
[39:28] there might have been some of them in
[39:29] there because they listened to the
[39:31] message of the hour
[39:36] look at martin luther he was probably
[39:38] about 50
[39:39] catholic brought about 50 of their
[39:42] doctrine
[39:42] but see that's the intertwining god
[39:45] winked at that folks but look there had
[39:47] to be a separation time come
[39:49] because god couldn't take a bride into a
[39:52] body change
[39:54] with that intertwining of that false
[39:57] listen there is no faults in god there
[40:00] is no false doctrine in god there is no
[40:02] false person in god
[40:04] it's all truth
[40:08] i am the way i am the truth
[40:11] and i am the life and where is that
[40:14] person that said that tonight
[40:16] he's inside of you saying the same thing
[40:21] you say oh you no brother branham
[40:24] you just took the place of god he said
[40:27] is that too far
[40:29] remember remember they said brother
[40:31] brother you just took the plate you've
[40:33] told them people to forgive
[40:34] their sins i listen folks the bible
[40:37] tells you says who's ever sins
[40:40] come on it's already in there it didn't
[40:42] take a profit he just vindicated it
[40:45] the bible tells you it says whoever sins
[40:48] you retain they're retained whoever sins
[40:50] you forgive yes
[40:52] they're forgiven that's what bible
[40:54] didn't take a prophet to come and write
[40:56] a new bible
[40:57] he was just showing you that it was
[40:58] already in there
[41:01] is that too far brother brown said them
[41:04] no
[41:07] i like that one where even the bible we
[41:08] don't quote this much but the bible says
[41:10] you lay hands on the sickness shall
[41:11] recover and if they have committed any
[41:15] sin it'll be forgiven
[41:19] boy come up here and get prayed for for
[41:20] a problem in your body and god just
[41:22] wipes the whole slate clean again
[41:26] wow you love the lord
[41:30] i'm telling you he has got to have
[41:33] a clean bride he's not going to marry
[41:36] somebody
[41:37] that's all messed up no he is not going
[41:40] to do that
[41:41] not in this end time now he may have
[41:42] took some of them and winked at their
[41:44] ignorance and all the different ones
[41:45] but remember he demands in this end time
[41:50] that we're born again he demands the
[41:53] truth in this end time whatever we got
[41:55] to do
[41:56] scratching claw the bible says he that
[41:59] overcometh
[42:00] right well i give these things to you
[42:03] not that he that slacketh to you that
[42:06] overcometh
[42:07] right right
[42:10] but there's your key
[42:14] god works with us the same way because
[42:17] you know what
[42:18] that's false doctrine right there but
[42:21] there is a true doctrine
[42:22] that you have to hear it you have to do
[42:26] it
[42:27] you have to become a part of it and then
[42:31] let that incarnate you
[42:32] just like the devil is doing the world
[42:35] because remember
[42:36] he can't be anything but a copycat satan
[42:38] cannot come up with an original anything
[42:41] right because he's not original he's a
[42:44] copycat
[42:46] but he can copy so close folks that's
[42:48] the difference
[42:49] he can copy so close so he can almost
[42:52] deceive the very elect
[42:53] according to the book of matthew and
[42:55] we'll read part of that in just a minute
[42:57] but let's go to uh
[42:59] ii thessalonians 2 let no man deceive
[43:03] you by any means
[43:04] for that day shall not come except there
[43:06] come a falling away first and we see
[43:08] that happening now
[43:10] and that man of sin being what revealed
[43:13] the son of perdition right who opposes
[43:16] and exalteth himself now all that's at
[43:18] them denominations out there bro wait
[43:20] they just
[43:22] um judas was in the message
[43:28] judas went to camp meetings yeah judas
[43:31] preached at camp meeting
[43:33] oh boy can i get any closer right
[43:36] judas said and said amen
[43:41] wow how close is that that even makes me
[43:44] get a
[43:46] shiver a little bit but you know what
[43:48] there was only one person knew who he
[43:50] was
[43:52] that was the son of man that's why the
[43:55] son of man
[43:56] had to come back in the end time
[44:00] to know and tell you that satan's in not
[44:03] you but it's satan's in flesh today
[44:06] and i'm in flesh today because when
[44:08] brother brown called us bride he told us
[44:11] that's who we were the body of jesus
[44:14] christ
[44:14] that's who the true bride is the true
[44:16] bride is the body
[44:18] of her lover the true body of her
[44:20] husband
[44:25] to me you've got all these mysteries
[44:28] because even paul says you can know all
[44:30] mysteries
[44:31] and not have charity but brother branham
[44:33] gave us a way to get to the new birth
[44:35] not a new way same way as always
[44:39] because remember see that's got all
[44:40] convoluted i gotta shake a hand
[44:43] like i said before you know the baptist
[44:45] shake a hand now if you was nine years
[44:46] old and you come up and you gave your
[44:48] heart to god and we turned around to
[44:50] give you the right hand of fellowship
[44:52] then if you don't darken the doors and
[44:54] you have you know have a hound dog life
[44:57] that's okay because right here
[45:01] see that's false teaching that's giving
[45:04] somebody false hope
[45:07] and and all the other different like
[45:09] brother brown said he said
[45:11] where did you come up with sprinkling
[45:14] sprinkling ain't even in the bible
[45:16] baptizes in the bible
[45:18] so have they come up with that somebody
[45:20] finally must have said
[45:21] i don't think we need to put them in the
[45:23] water we just need to sprinkle water
[45:24] over top of them
[45:26] we don't need to baptize babies we just
[45:27] need to sprinkle them
[45:29] now we believe in dedicating babies
[45:30] right but we don't believe in putting
[45:32] them over the holy water and sprinkling
[45:34] holy water and they're already
[45:35] do you know what that to a catholic
[45:39] his sister anna canard was here tonight
[45:41] she'd tell you that baby has to go to
[45:43] that whatever they call
[45:44] that luis what is that you know what
[45:47] it's a little baby dedication where they
[45:48] sprinkle the water see that puts them in
[45:50] heaven
[45:51] that's their huh confirmation
[45:56] see you say well they're just taking the
[45:57] baby in this but no
[45:59] they're literally believing that that
[46:01] priest is putting the holy water on them
[46:03] right
[46:03] right right louis right and that they're
[46:06] they're not they that confirmation
[46:08] proves
[46:10] that they're going to go to heaven
[46:12] because they're now a confirmed catholic
[46:13] that's where their confirmation comes
[46:15] from now you know that's a lie
[46:17] but they believe the lie in our damn
[46:20] bible
[46:21] glory let no man deceive you by
[46:24] any means
[46:28] paul said for that day shall not come
[46:32] except there come a falling away first
[46:33] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[46:35] of perdition
[46:36] who opposes and exalted himself above
[46:38] all that is called god
[46:41] or that is worship see listen
[46:45] folks here's the key
[46:48] satan cannot exalt himself
[46:52] i love this satan cannot exalt himself
[46:56] or his imps above you
[46:59] god won't allow it exactly
[47:02] god won't allow it he lost all that he
[47:05] lost that
[47:06] being the right hand man he lost that
[47:09] so he can't whatever you go through
[47:11] whatever problem whatever
[47:13] imp that god that satan sends you
[47:15] whatever demon satan sends you
[47:17] it's not any more powerful than you let
[47:20] it be
[47:22] because greater is heinous in you than
[47:25] heed us in the world
[47:28] there's a greater force yes
[47:32] at work here because listen
[47:35] he's not opposing and exalting himself
[47:39] to the world out there he's wanting you
[47:41] to worship him
[47:44] he's wanting you to worship him and
[47:46] we've done it for years
[47:50] but when god pulls us away satan hates
[47:53] that that's why brother ram said god
[47:55] god said satan turns every gun on you
[47:57] why because he's lost a good soldier
[47:59] he's lost a good guy
[48:01] you used to forward his kingdom some of
[48:06] you may not have
[48:07] but i sure did
[48:10] hello i thought the bible said confess
[48:14] your sacrificial sins
[48:16] one to the other i was a sinner
[48:20] okay but now once you come here though
[48:24] but remember i've always told like i
[48:26] said before i'm talking about one person
[48:28] sure i know i call catholic and i know i
[48:30] call baptist but
[48:31] but that's a system right that's a
[48:34] system i'm not one
[48:36] person that's a system they're under
[48:38] though but now remember though
[48:40] once you attach yourself to that system
[48:42] you're part of that system
[48:45] once you attach yourself to god like you
[48:47] did a year or so ago
[48:49] never can that be taken away but now you
[48:51] know what you satan you can attach
[48:53] yourself to different things and satan
[48:54] will go
[48:55] no i don't want you over here now i
[48:57] don't want you over here he'll bang you
[48:58] around like an eight ball
[49:01] right but god won't when god says you're
[49:04] my child he seals you
[49:06] until the day of your redemption
[49:10] amen who opposes and exalted himself
[49:13] above
[49:14] all that is called god or that is
[49:16] worship
[49:17] so that he as god sitteth in the temple
[49:20] of god
[49:20] showing himself that he is god remember
[49:23] you not
[49:23] that when i was yet with you now this is
[49:26] paul
[49:27] two thousand years ago i told you these
[49:29] things look
[49:30] and now you know what withholdeth that
[49:33] he might be revealed in his time now you
[49:35] know paul said
[49:36] grievous wolves are coming in in other
[49:38] words new doctrine is going to show up
[49:41] nicea is going to show up all these
[49:43] false teachers constantine and all these
[49:45] different ones corinthians and all the
[49:47] different ones just brings doctrine in
[49:49] and even the denominational people
[49:53] the doctrine not the person the doctrine
[49:56] you know what i believe it's just me
[50:00] joseph smith started the baptist church
[50:03] right isn't that right joseph smith
[50:05] started the baptist church
[50:07] i believe he'll be in heaven right
[50:10] because he started a move of god
[50:12] but what happened was the people got a
[50:15] hold of it and said this is it
[50:17] and god moved on right same way with all
[50:20] the different ones because brother brown
[50:22] names them all i mean he'll name them
[50:24] that's why people talk about billy
[50:25] graham and oral roberts in the message
[50:27] being
[50:27] lost ain't they not lost they had the
[50:31] they had the new birth for their time
[50:33] because
[50:34] brother branham had nobody else
[50:37] i wish oh i wish that billy graham and
[50:41] oral roberts would have heard him one
[50:42] time say
[50:44] a modern billy graham and oral roberts
[50:47] just like the two witnesses that were
[50:48] with
[50:49] that were with melchizedek and they were
[50:52] sent to sodom to blind the people's eyes
[50:54] what would you think they'd think oh no
[50:57] not me
[50:58] i'm just i just preached to the world
[51:01] but they did that's exactly what they
[51:02] did they were identified in the word
[51:04] how much more can me and you be
[51:05] identified in the word of god amen
[51:08] so that's like i said before let's not
[51:10] disclude anybody
[51:13] but let's let's disclude systems
[51:17] systems of false doctrine that we now
[51:19] know because look
[51:21] if you're faced with a doctrine and it's
[51:23] the truth and you turn it down that's
[51:25] iniquity
[51:27] that's why the mystery of iniquity we'll
[51:29] read it here in just a minute
[51:31] right now pull it back up
[51:34] and now you know what withholdeth that
[51:36] he might be revealed in his time
[51:39] because the first church age wasn't his
[51:41] time look for the mystery of iniquity
[51:43] does
[51:44] already work
[51:47] only he who now letteth will let now
[51:49] brother branham
[51:50] take a prophet only he god who now
[51:53] letteth will lead until he the bride be
[51:55] taken out of the way
[51:56] right so there we are the mystery of
[51:59] iniquity does already work
[52:01] and god's going to let it work until
[52:03] this end time
[52:04] where the separation time comes because
[52:07] listen
[52:07] if you're not born again you're part of
[52:10] that mystery of iniquity
[52:11] right right that's what your system
[52:15] is giving you is false doctrine even
[52:18] though you may show them the bible where
[52:20] where
[52:21] peter said repent be baptized the name
[52:22] of jesus christ they turn it down that's
[52:24] iniquity but now remember
[52:28] they call you false and them true
[52:32] right right
[52:35] they call you false and them true
[52:38] that ain't happening right you're the
[52:41] truth
[52:42] glory but what's that that's iniquity
[52:44] when you read it to them and show
[52:46] it to them and they turn it down
[52:48] iniquity is knowing to do right and not
[52:51] doing it right
[52:52] or doing something wrong knowing you're
[52:54] supposed to do it right
[52:56] how many preachers in brother brown's
[52:57] time how many of those 300 preachers in
[52:59] chicago
[53:00] oh brother branham we're coming down
[53:02] there to be baptized get the pool
[53:04] ready we'll be down there and not one of
[53:06] them showed up
[53:08] they went into that mystery of iniquity
[53:11] right
[53:12] to they heard the message they heard the
[53:14] word and they turned it down why
[53:16] because to save face to save a
[53:18] denomination to save their church to
[53:20] save some organization
[53:23] right they just went right on had
[53:27] churches and had church and they didn't
[53:28] all quit preaching
[53:30] they stayed right there in that system
[53:32] see that's where that intertwining was
[53:33] so strong
[53:35] nobody could pull that apart except
[53:36] brother bradham
[53:38] the spirit of god threw a prophet in the
[53:40] end time a word prophet
[53:42] to pull that thing apart to pull that
[53:44] book open
[53:48] you amen if you want to i'll lay a
[53:49] minute
[53:51] so let's read number two next position
[53:52] of the church ages
[53:54] now to get the real meaning of what
[53:55] we're about to go into i must caution
[53:57] you look at this
[53:58] to ever keep in mind that religion
[54:02] spiritual matters if you like is
[54:04] composed
[54:05] of two parts that intertwine
[54:08] but are opposite as black and white
[54:12] religion and the spiritual world are
[54:15] made up
[54:16] are made of these two trees which had
[54:19] their roots
[54:20] in eden both the tree of life and the
[54:23] tree of knowledge of good and evil stood
[54:24] in the midst of the garden and no doubt
[54:26] their very branches
[54:28] intertwined each other
[54:31] thus in the ephesian church age is that
[54:34] same paradox
[54:36] the church is made up of good and the
[54:39] church
[54:41] the church is made up of good and bad
[54:44] two vines make the church
[54:48] whoa they are like the wheat and tares
[54:52] growing up
[54:53] side by side but one is true
[54:56] the other is false now god will speak
[54:59] to each one
[55:02] and he will talk about each one
[55:07] he will call them the church
[55:11] but now look at this special group of
[55:13] people
[55:15] and only the elect will really know
[55:18] which is the true spirit
[55:21] only the elect will not be
[55:25] deceived wow
[55:28] because he continues on in matthew 24 24
[55:31] for there shall arise false christ and
[55:32] false prophets
[55:33] show great signs and wonders and so much
[55:35] that if it were possible they deceived
[55:36] the very lack
[55:37] look so way back there in the early
[55:39] church very short period after pentecost
[55:42] the false vine got to intertwine itself
[55:45] around the true vine
[55:47] to find these deeds of the nicolaitans
[55:49] we don't spoke about them
[55:51] brother brown brings that up in the
[55:52] first four seals and that spirit is
[55:55] going to be found
[55:56] fighting the true vine until it is
[55:58] destroyed
[55:59] by god
[56:03] and it's going to be destroyed the bible
[56:04] says by what the brightness of his
[56:06] coming now
[56:08] from the eastern sky he's going to walk
[56:10] down this big ball of light
[56:11] no it's going to be revealed in you
[56:16] you're the mystery remember you are that
[56:18] person
[56:19] now have you got it he said and i ask
[56:22] you have you got it so let's read
[56:23] matthew
[56:24] 13 24. another parable
[56:28] put forth unto them saying the kingdom
[56:29] of heaven is likened to a man which
[56:31] sowed good seed in his field
[56:33] but while a man while the men slept his
[56:35] enemy came in and sowed tares among the
[56:37] wheat and went his way
[56:39] but when the blade was sprung up and
[56:41] brought forth fruit
[56:42] then appeared the tares also got it okay
[56:47] verse 27 so the servants of the
[56:49] household came and said unto him sir
[56:52] this knocked out so good satan i filled
[56:54] from whence hath these tares
[56:57] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[56:58] this there's your two spirits
[57:01] two seeds they can't cross now sure they
[57:03] can intertwine
[57:04] but you can't make one or the other
[57:05] without what a conversion
[57:07] brother brown talks about cuckoo burn
[57:09] talks about wheat
[57:11] all listen we were all born cuckleberg
[57:14] we were sown by that tire of that evil
[57:18] one
[57:19] we were all born in sin we were all born
[57:21] by mama and daddy we were all born by
[57:22] the wrong seed
[57:26] cares
[57:29] but thank god by the power of
[57:31] transformation
[57:32] glory god's the only one who can do it
[57:35] man can't do it right man can't take an
[57:38] apple tree and make
[57:40] it a full orange tree sure he can graft
[57:42] it
[57:43] and he can do a little bit of that but
[57:44] he cannot make an apple seed produce an
[57:47] orange
[57:51] that's why i like that song they sing
[57:53] he's the only one who can take a sea and
[57:54] open it up and make a highway out of it
[57:58] he's the only one that can take a valley
[57:59] of dry bones and make it talk and make
[58:01] it live
[58:02] he's the only one who can do that right
[58:05] nobody else can do that
[58:06] that's right he's the only one who can
[58:08] take shame and make glory out of it
[58:13] the only one but who is he doing it
[58:16] through
[58:20] you
[58:24] talk about it later
[58:27] so the servant of the household came and
[58:29] said sir does not tell so good seed and
[58:31] thy field from whence has these come the
[58:33] tares
[58:33] and he said unto them and enemy hath
[58:35] done this the servant said unto them
[58:37] wilt now then that we go and gather them
[58:39] up in other words
[58:41] lord we're in the first church age paul
[58:43] we're in the first church age paul
[58:45] we need to condemn that thing but you
[58:47] can't cut it down
[58:51] you gotta let it grow cause see there's
[58:53] some good seed that's gonna be in there
[58:55] but there is some bad seed and we gotta
[58:58] let it manifest
[59:01] corn or kuckleberg
[59:05] because they both look the same got it
[59:07] right
[59:08] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[59:11] the tares
[59:12] you root up the wheat too
[59:15] with them let both grow together
[59:19] intertwine for seven
[59:22] church six church ages
[59:25] but there's going to be a time of
[59:27] harvest
[59:28] where let both grow together until the
[59:31] harvest now
[59:32] folks if this is not harvest time i
[59:34] don't know what time it is
[59:36] this is the harvest time there is no
[59:38] other planting of a seed
[59:41] the seed's been sown right amen it's
[59:43] manifest in time i wish somebody wrote a
[59:46] song about that
[59:48] let both grow together until the harvest
[59:50] and in the time of harvest
[59:52] i will say to the reapers gather ye
[59:55] together
[59:56] first the tares
[1:00:02] and what bind them in bundles
[1:00:05] you never bind wheat at the harvest
[1:00:08] you bind it later you cut the wheat down
[1:00:12] it has to lay over and die
[1:00:15] then you harvest but he's telling get
[1:00:18] the tares
[1:00:19] first and bind them in bundles
[1:00:24] to burn them
[1:00:27] got to separate folks
[1:00:30] but gather the wheat into my barn
[1:00:35] my barn gather the wheat into my barn
[1:00:38] not my
[1:00:38] neighbor's barn not the second person of
[1:00:40] a trinity barn
[1:00:42] my barn i'm the one that planted that
[1:00:45] good seed
[1:00:47] and the devil planted that other seed
[1:00:50] we're going to let it go
[1:00:52] until harvest time
[1:00:55] and then i'm going to send a prophet
[1:00:57] that's going to take what
[1:00:58] the loose ends he's going to take this
[1:01:01] tree and this tree
[1:01:02] put them together and grow one great
[1:01:04] tree
[1:01:06] called the truth you know what that tree
[1:01:09] that he saw grow was that's that tree of
[1:01:11] life that was in the garden of eden
[1:01:15] because there was no faults in that tree
[1:01:17] of life
[1:01:18] there was no denominational branch there
[1:01:20] was not one grafted in there
[1:01:24] so let's read now an exposition of the
[1:01:25] church age next quote
[1:01:28] harvest time yes harvest time
[1:01:31] the two vines that grew together and
[1:01:33] intertwined their branches
[1:01:35] are now to be separated the fruit of
[1:01:39] those vines which were at such
[1:01:41] variants will be gathered into separate
[1:01:43] garners
[1:01:44] look he turns it right to the two
[1:01:46] spirits
[1:01:48] the two spirits will go to their
[1:01:49] separate destinations listen they won't
[1:01:52] be one sinner in heaven
[1:01:55] and they won't be one saved in hell
[1:01:56] right everybody got that
[1:01:58] now we're all center saved by grace but
[1:02:00] you know what we're not sinners no more
[1:02:03] i just read you where paul said or john
[1:02:06] said
[1:02:07] your seed remain you say you can't sin
[1:02:10] that man inside of you cannot sin
[1:02:13] and it can't even be accounted for the
[1:02:15] sin you do if you ask for forgiveness
[1:02:18] good grief we sure are living below our
[1:02:22] privileges
[1:02:24] the two spirits will go to their
[1:02:25] separate destinations now it is time to
[1:02:28] heed
[1:02:29] the final call that comes only to the
[1:02:32] somebody say that
[1:02:33] wheat bride
[1:02:37] come out of her my people
[1:02:40] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:02:42] and that ye
[1:02:43] wheat receive not her tares
[1:02:46] plagues the great tribulation of the
[1:02:48] sixth seal
[1:02:49] in matthew 24. like i said before
[1:02:53] you'll never stand in judgment
[1:02:57] once you receive the baptism of the holy
[1:02:58] ghost you put
[1:03:00] every every judgment you ever have you
[1:03:03] lay it on jesus christ and he took it
[1:03:04] all away from you at calvary
[1:03:07] that's why brother brown says never
[1:03:09] forget calvary
[1:03:11] never forget that 2 000 years ago
[1:03:16] when that wheat bride seed was inside of
[1:03:19] that man
[1:03:20] right spiritually not naturally
[1:03:22] spiritually and on the day of pentecost
[1:03:25] he started planting that seed and he's
[1:03:27] not finished planting yet
[1:03:29] oh yeah we say it's harvest time sure it
[1:03:31] is but there's a little few little seeds
[1:03:33] out here that needs to be
[1:03:34] that needs to be that needs to grow up a
[1:03:36] little
[1:03:37] we need to start showing our true fruit
[1:03:39] whatever we are we're going to listen
[1:03:41] this is the end time you will either be
[1:03:43] a tear or you'll be wheat
[1:03:46] can't help it
[1:03:50] number four hearing recognizing acting
[1:03:53] on the word of god
[1:03:56] here's we'll come to the end
[1:04:00] education's at the end politics is at
[1:04:03] the end
[1:04:05] war is at the end this is 1960.
[1:04:11] how many years ago
[1:04:14] 60 years ago
[1:04:17] civilizations at the end all these
[1:04:21] things
[1:04:21] all those things are at the end my what
[1:04:26] can we do then
[1:04:27] what is next we're at the end of all
[1:04:29] things
[1:04:30] now we know what brother brown said
[1:04:31] about the seventh seal said that was the
[1:04:33] end of all things right
[1:04:34] that's why i'm telling you folks you you
[1:04:36] may think this uncommon
[1:04:38] but if we don't get the revelation of
[1:04:39] those seven seals like the prophet got
[1:04:41] them
[1:04:42] you're not going in a body change
[1:04:48] now the church life is at the end the
[1:04:50] normal
[1:04:52] church we're not normal
[1:04:56] now this may stick just a little bit but
[1:04:58] the church carnal
[1:04:59] the esau church she's coming to her hand
[1:05:04] wow what's she doing heading up in the
[1:05:07] federation of churches which will
[1:05:08] finally
[1:05:09] join the romanism to fight catholicism
[1:05:12] now watch he was wrong he corrected
[1:05:14] himself
[1:05:15] or with catholicism to fight
[1:05:18] communism pope john is calling for all
[1:05:21] the churches to come back that's 1960.
[1:05:23] and they will and they'll unite
[1:05:25] themselves together just exactly what
[1:05:28] thus saith the lord so we know as we
[1:05:31] talk about the six visions or the
[1:05:33] seven that he had that brother dale was
[1:05:34] talking about he said that thus saith
[1:05:36] the lord well that's so thus saith the
[1:05:37] lord too they're all going to head up
[1:05:39] into romanism
[1:05:43] well listen as of today right now
[1:05:47] those 1200 different denominations have
[1:05:49] some form
[1:05:51] of romanism in them because remember
[1:05:54] rome will rule the world
[1:05:57] you say romanism i said yeah catholicism
[1:05:59] same thing
[1:06:00] right there is catholic doctrine in
[1:06:03] every
[1:06:05] people are going to hate this in every
[1:06:07] denomination
[1:06:08] in the world there is some form of
[1:06:10] catholic
[1:06:11] influence
[1:06:15] whether you be baptist and say i know
[1:06:18] that rome's
[1:06:19] that's the antichrist catholicism and
[1:06:22] then you say
[1:06:22] well now what difference is them in you
[1:06:24] right except for maybe a couple of
[1:06:26] little items
[1:06:28] and where did your baptism come from
[1:06:33] you see how it's going to make them mad
[1:06:35] because they're not going to get mad
[1:06:37] satan's going to get mad
[1:06:39] all right they'll be okay with that
[1:06:41] number five the breach between the
[1:06:42] church ages and the seals
[1:06:45] seal signifies now this is the word i
[1:06:47] got from the dictionary seal signifies a
[1:06:50] finished work
[1:06:51] and when the seventh seal is broke now
[1:06:53] he's in the breach he's not gotten to
[1:06:54] the seventh seal yet
[1:06:55] the mystery of god revelations 10 7
[1:06:58] that sealed in these mysterious seals
[1:07:02] is finished until the day that seal is
[1:07:05] broken then it's revealed what's on the
[1:07:07] inside of it
[1:07:09] if the man's wondering what's in that
[1:07:11] box car
[1:07:12] you say i suppose it's supposed to be
[1:07:14] such and such
[1:07:15] you know you can you can presume all you
[1:07:17] want to
[1:07:18] you can put this box car up here with
[1:07:20] this great big lock on it
[1:07:21] you can say that's all kitkat bars
[1:07:27] and then boy to walk up and say no i
[1:07:29] don't like kitkat bars that's all
[1:07:30] s'mores
[1:07:32] then then brother louise walks up and
[1:07:34] says no i believe it's
[1:07:36] all dark chocolate you understand what
[1:07:38] i'm saying
[1:07:39] the different ideas we have of what's in
[1:07:41] that car
[1:07:42] but until you know what's in that car
[1:07:46] you are presuming so it took a profit
[1:07:49] it took the angel of the lord right
[1:07:51] through the prophet
[1:07:53] to come down and pull that seal off the
[1:07:56] door
[1:07:57] and open the door and say this is it
[1:08:00] man if a man's wondering what's in that
[1:08:03] box
[1:08:04] he said i suppose it's such and such see
[1:08:06] that's what and listen
[1:08:08] i don't belittle people they people are
[1:08:10] listen true
[1:08:12] i say true true to their denomination
[1:08:15] they're trying listen
[1:08:16] there's nobody coming to church to say
[1:08:18] well i just don't know
[1:08:19] no they're trying to do something
[1:08:21] there's some good people that are trying
[1:08:23] their best
[1:08:24] even to make something happen amen
[1:08:27] but they don't have the truth they're
[1:08:30] just presuming
[1:08:32] right every doctrine out there they're
[1:08:36] presuming that it's
[1:08:38] right because they somebody can come
[1:08:40] along and say
[1:08:41] no it's sprinkling no it's pouring
[1:08:44] no it's baptizing well now what are you
[1:08:47] going to what are you going to pour in
[1:08:48] father son holy ghost
[1:08:50] you're going to pour in the lord jesus
[1:08:51] christ you're going to baptize in
[1:08:54] presuming right what's in the car but
[1:08:57] listen
[1:08:58] there is actually something in the car
[1:09:02] in it
[1:09:08] but when the seal is broken and the door
[1:09:10] is open we see
[1:09:12] into it then and see exactly
[1:09:18] and i like kitkat so it's all kicking
[1:09:22] you see it and that'll only be done
[1:09:25] at the end time that boxcar of theology
[1:09:30] are of of truth not theology but that
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] boxcar of truth has moved down six
[1:09:35] church ages
[1:09:36] nobody's been able to open the door oh
[1:09:39] people have got close to try to open the
[1:09:41] door they might have looked through a
[1:09:42] slat and they saw three instead of one
[1:09:44] right they looked through a hole and
[1:09:46] said father son holy ghost
[1:09:48] hell's eternal i think i think that's
[1:09:50] right so-and-so said it was
[1:09:53] but brother branham said if god doesn't
[1:09:55] come on the scene he said we're only
[1:09:57] presuming
[1:10:00] so see to the world brother louise we're
[1:10:02] presuming
[1:10:07] you talk to people in denominations they
[1:10:10] think you're crazy
[1:10:13] because they got their own boss car
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:17] but the door's still shut amen there's
[1:10:20] no open book
[1:10:22] we have an open book we have an open
[1:10:25] door
[1:10:27] we know what's behind that door
[1:10:33] but when that seal is broke and the door
[1:10:35] is open
[1:10:36] we see into it then and see exactly
[1:10:39] what's in there right we're not
[1:10:41] presuming
[1:10:42] all right let's go to number six
[1:10:46] we must remember that the seventh seal
[1:10:49] is the end of time
[1:10:50] of all things that's right
[1:10:55] the things written in the seventh
[1:10:57] seventh seal book remember sealed up
[1:10:59] what is the seven
[1:10:59] seal book the bible and if the
[1:11:03] if it's the word in letter
[1:11:08] and you though are the word
[1:11:13] you're the word made flesh in the
[1:11:16] beginning was a word whereas with god
[1:11:18] and words god and the word was made
[1:11:20] flesh
[1:11:22] and dwelt among us that's what we got to
[1:11:25] identify
[1:11:26] we can't identify and say well we think
[1:11:28] we're the word
[1:11:30] see satan thinks he is you got to know
[1:11:35] when you know you're the word you know
[1:11:37] he's not right exactly
[1:11:40] that gives us confidence
[1:11:43] it gives me confidence to press play
[1:11:46] whenever i want to
[1:11:49] but it gives me confidence to listen to
[1:11:51] a good holy ghost-filled preacher amen
[1:11:53] they can break these things down and not
[1:11:55] be presuming
[1:11:58] but know what god said amen
[1:12:01] because there's a true message i'm going
[1:12:04] to shout that
[1:12:05] all year there's a true message there's
[1:12:06] a true people
[1:12:09] and this is it christ why are you look
[1:12:12] for something else
[1:12:14] right i'm like the two angels when jesus
[1:12:17] resurrected
[1:12:18] they said why seek ye the living among
[1:12:19] the dead
[1:12:28] things written in the seven seal books
[1:12:29] sealed up of the what
[1:12:31] plan of redemption
[1:12:34] folks that's all the seals are it's the
[1:12:36] plan of redemption
[1:12:38] the real plan not the false plan
[1:12:42] the real plan sealed up for the plan of
[1:12:45] redemption from before the foundation of
[1:12:47] the world
[1:12:48] it ever bit ends it is the end
[1:12:51] it's the end of the struggling world
[1:12:54] it's the end of struggling nature
[1:12:56] it's the end of everything in there is
[1:12:58] the end of the trumpets it's the end of
[1:12:59] the vials
[1:13:00] it's the end of the earth because
[1:13:02] remember look when the sevens
[1:13:04] when the seals are revealed to the bride
[1:13:07] what do we do with them
[1:13:08] we go out of here yeah
[1:13:11] israel don't get the sales like we get
[1:13:15] them
[1:13:16] because they don't get a body change
[1:13:17] they have to die
[1:13:19] right right they have to die they get
[1:13:22] the son of man message but they don't
[1:13:24] get the whole headstone
[1:13:26] right because they've rejected the
[1:13:27] headstone you and i have not
[1:13:31] well you have to decide whether you're
[1:13:32] rejected or not
[1:13:36] that's what i'm telling you it's a
[1:13:37] requirement to know these things
[1:13:41] right it's the end of the vials it's the
[1:13:43] end of the earth it's it's even the end
[1:13:44] of time
[1:13:46] remember in revelations 10 we'll read it
[1:13:48] in a minute which is
[1:13:49] one foot on land one for don't sin says
[1:13:51] what time
[1:13:53] will be no longer amen
[1:13:56] time runs out the bible said so matthew
[1:13:58] the seventh i mean revelations the
[1:14:00] seventh
[1:14:00] tenth chapter and one through seven time
[1:14:02] runs out the angel
[1:14:04] says time will be no more when that when
[1:14:07] the days of this great thing to happen
[1:14:10] everything runs out in this time the end
[1:14:12] of the at the end of this seventh
[1:14:14] seal now watch this notice it's the end
[1:14:17] of the church age
[1:14:22] it's the end of the seven seals it's the
[1:14:25] end of the trumpets
[1:14:26] it's the end of the vials even ends the
[1:14:29] ushering in of the millennium listen
[1:14:31] it's got to end in me and you
[1:14:35] to take us to these other places
[1:14:38] there will be no millennium until we
[1:14:41] come
[1:14:42] somebody comes to the true revelation of
[1:14:46] the seventh seal
[1:14:47] because it's withholding right
[1:14:51] the boxcar hasn't been opened yet right
[1:14:54] it's the end of the trumpets the end of
[1:14:56] the vials even the string of the
[1:14:57] millennium that's on the seventh seal
[1:14:59] now what what did the seventh seal cover
[1:15:02] think about just a minute let me run
[1:15:04] through this this is not on my nose but
[1:15:05] can i run through this just a minute
[1:15:06] first four seals is what that's me and
[1:15:08] you that's the four combat beast
[1:15:10] the fourth seal the rapture takes place
[1:15:12] in the fourth seal we go up
[1:15:13] what happens on the fifth seal goes to
[1:15:16] the jews
[1:15:17] what happened to the sixth seal battle
[1:15:19] of armageddon
[1:15:20] what's after the battle of armageddon
[1:15:23] millennium
[1:15:25] that's what he's talking about this
[1:15:27] thing has the book has opened to the
[1:15:28] prophet
[1:15:29] getting ready to open to him well this
[1:15:31] is in the seventh seal it's opened up to
[1:15:32] him
[1:15:33] showing him all away we don't have to
[1:15:35] worry about what's going to happen to
[1:15:36] the jews we don't have to worry about
[1:15:38] who the two witnesses are
[1:15:39] we know who they are we know when
[1:15:42] they're coming
[1:15:44] remember listen folks there was a uh
[1:15:47] i don't know if it was the campbell
[1:15:48] lights or whoever it was i hate to call
[1:15:50] names but
[1:15:51] remember even brother brown said they
[1:15:52] thought they were the 144 thousand it
[1:15:54] was just going to be 144
[1:15:56] 000 bride saved
[1:15:59] see that's not true we know the 144
[1:16:03] thousand are all jews according to
[1:16:04] revelation according to the fifth seal
[1:16:08] you even got a fifth sealed jew that
[1:16:09] gets their life gift or
[1:16:11] eternal life gift to him while 144 000
[1:16:14] has to die
[1:16:16] listen the pathway for me and you
[1:16:19] has been laid to the future home
[1:16:23] we know exactly what's going to happen
[1:16:26] next
[1:16:26] we may not know who or when or what day
[1:16:28] but we know what's going to happen
[1:16:31] we know that the rapture will not take
[1:16:33] place until someone comes to that
[1:16:35] headstone
[1:16:36] and christ speaks through them just like
[1:16:39] he spoke to himself
[1:16:41] and said lazarus come forth
[1:16:44] because that call will come from the
[1:16:46] bride
[1:16:49] we will not have to go out and gather
[1:16:51] around
[1:16:52] a a a cemetery
[1:16:56] see people do that they do seances and
[1:16:59] all that evil stuff they do
[1:17:01] to try to commune with the dead folks we
[1:17:04] ain't going to communion with the dead
[1:17:07] we're going to bring them live people
[1:17:09] back to here
[1:17:11] and then we're going to be changed it's
[1:17:14] going to be such a power to we can't
[1:17:15] stand it anymore
[1:17:17] we're going to have to be changed then
[1:17:19] we're going to just step
[1:17:20] over into another dimension and let god
[1:17:22] wipe this thing off
[1:17:24] two prophets come in right
[1:17:27] it's just like firing a rock into the
[1:17:29] air and that rocket explodes here and it
[1:17:30] goes up then it explodes again
[1:17:32] it puts out five stars one of those
[1:17:33] stars explodes and blows out five more
[1:17:35] stars
[1:17:36] and one of them stars explode blows out
[1:17:37] have you ever seen that in a roman
[1:17:39] candle
[1:17:40] roman candle usually has eight balls in
[1:17:42] it different colors
[1:17:43] but once they go up there's another
[1:17:46] charge in each ball
[1:17:47] and they explode and when the m8 explode
[1:17:49] it makes 16 or 20 or every how many and
[1:17:51] it multiplies
[1:17:52] that's what brother i'm saying about us
[1:17:54] revelation
[1:17:57] have you ever seen where revelation
[1:17:58] starts tying things together that's that
[1:18:00] rocket
[1:18:01] that's that roman candle going off in
[1:18:03] you
[1:18:06] putting things together and then it
[1:18:08] explodes you go
[1:18:09] that ain't nothing about the truth
[1:18:13] and then one of them stars explodes
[1:18:15] blows off five more stars it fades on
[1:18:16] now
[1:18:17] that's what the seventh seal it just
[1:18:19] ends the time of the world
[1:18:21] it ends the time for this it means the
[1:18:24] time for that
[1:18:25] it ends the time for this i need i'm
[1:18:26] running out of room to read here
[1:18:29] thank you it means the time for that it
[1:18:31] ends the time for this it ends the time
[1:18:33] everything must
[1:18:34] just ended up on that seventh seal
[1:18:38] let's read revelations 10 7 musicians
[1:18:40] get ready to come we'll read one more
[1:18:41] quote we'll be done
[1:18:44] this is very familiar but listen this is
[1:18:47] talking about you
[1:18:49] because what did paul call the great
[1:18:52] mystery
[1:18:54] in colossians the great mystery was
[1:18:58] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:19:02] not christ in the church right not
[1:19:05] christ in the trees
[1:19:08] not christ in the books not christ in
[1:19:10] the tapes
[1:19:12] but you got to become what's on that
[1:19:13] table if it lays on that tape
[1:19:16] what it can be presumed listen
[1:19:19] jesus never ever woke up one day
[1:19:23] and was contrary to the one inside of
[1:19:25] him right
[1:19:27] me and my father we sure fought today no
[1:19:30] he said i
[1:19:31] only do that which the father shows me
[1:19:34] you say i can't do that i think he
[1:19:38] prayed
[1:19:38] in john 17 he said i pray father that
[1:19:43] me and them be the same as me and you
[1:19:49] and they were one we not been over this
[1:19:51] they were one right
[1:19:52] we're not a second person to jesus
[1:19:54] christ
[1:19:56] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:19:58] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:20:00] sound the mystery
[1:20:03] what i'll say it tonight the mystery of
[1:20:05] who the bride really is
[1:20:08] not a church not a denomination
[1:20:13] but a people of god that he spoke in
[1:20:16] genesis 1 and said
[1:20:18] they will come
[1:20:21] the mystery of god should be
[1:20:24] finished we don't start this thing we
[1:20:29] finish it
[1:20:33] as he hath declared to his servants
[1:20:36] the prophets and we know that john typed
[1:20:39] the bride and we know they told him to
[1:20:40] eat the book and it was an open book we
[1:20:42] know that
[1:20:43] but let's read this one quote we'll be
[1:20:44] done musicians get ready to come
[1:20:47] revelation of jesus christ church age
[1:20:48] book you will recall that i mentioned at
[1:20:50] the beginning of this message that this
[1:20:52] book we're studying
[1:20:53] is the actual revelation of who jesus
[1:20:56] himself
[1:20:58] in the church and his work in the future
[1:21:00] ages
[1:21:01] then i mention that it takes the holy
[1:21:03] spirit to give us revelation
[1:21:05] or we will fail to get it
[1:21:09] all right so he just separated him
[1:21:11] there's a false spirit and there's a
[1:21:14] real one
[1:21:17] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:21:20] will see
[1:21:20] that it won't take just ordinary study
[1:21:24] right listen man
[1:21:27] has done a lot of ordinary studying
[1:21:31] to bring in these listen father son holy
[1:21:34] ghost is not a revelation
[1:21:36] the only revelation of that is it's
[1:21:38] false
[1:21:40] but that's revealed to us not somebody
[1:21:42] that you know hangs their soul
[1:21:44] on it right these people hang their soul
[1:21:45] in these different doctrines
[1:21:47] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:21:49] will see that it won't take just
[1:21:50] ordinary study and thinking i thought
[1:21:57] to make this book real is going to take
[1:22:00] the operation
[1:22:02] of the holy ghost that means this book
[1:22:05] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:22:08] special class of people
[1:22:14] it will take one with prophetic insight
[1:22:17] that's what i'm telling you we can
[1:22:18] wonder
[1:22:19] and presume what's going on the rest of
[1:22:20] this year but that thing inside of you
[1:22:22] already knows what's going to happen
[1:22:24] this year you just please listen to it
[1:22:27] if you've ever listened to god this is
[1:22:29] the year you need to listen to that
[1:22:31] little small voice inside and you know
[1:22:33] what
[1:22:34] satan's voice most of the time is what i
[1:22:36] hear
[1:22:40] how do you figure it out you check it by
[1:22:42] the word
[1:22:43] you check it by the word give it the
[1:22:46] word test brother brown said
[1:22:47] because remember that's one thing satan
[1:22:49] cannot stand he cannot stand the word
[1:22:53] it will take one with prophetic insight
[1:22:55] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:22:58] god
[1:22:58] right it will require supernatural
[1:23:03] instruction not just a student comparing
[1:23:06] verse by verse that's the problem they
[1:23:07] go
[1:23:08] verse by verse and they'll they come up
[1:23:10] with all these different doctrines
[1:23:11] but that's not by the holy ghost the
[1:23:13] holy ghost never
[1:23:15] quickened false doctrine it can't
[1:23:18] right it can allow it to happen but it
[1:23:21] cannot quicken it
[1:23:22] we're talking about this year a
[1:23:24] quickening of what you've got inside of
[1:23:26] you
[1:23:27] it will require supernatural instruction
[1:23:29] but now remember
[1:23:32] remember it will quicken inside of you
[1:23:36] true and false because they got to
[1:23:40] separate
[1:23:42] you've got to discern and withstand the
[1:23:45] antichrist spirit then i read you the
[1:23:46] quote before
[1:23:47] you've got to do that you say boy you
[1:23:50] make this so hard it's not hard
[1:23:52] give it the word test give it the word
[1:23:54] test
[1:23:55] if it's contrary to the word it is not
[1:23:57] god
[1:23:58] right it will require supernatural
[1:24:01] instruction not
[1:24:02] just a student comparing verse with
[1:24:04] verse though that is good
[1:24:06] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:24:10] the spirit
[1:24:12] or it never becomes clear that's why
[1:24:16] folks i believe in a five-fold ministry
[1:24:19] not just listening to the prophet i
[1:24:22] don't discount that but i'm telling you
[1:24:24] that's where a lot of false doctrine has
[1:24:26] come from just listening to the prophet
[1:24:29] because the devil can get in this thing
[1:24:30] right here
[1:24:32] and make you think he's saying what he's
[1:24:34] saying but he's not
[1:24:36] how we need to hear from god and lay
[1:24:39] ourselves open
[1:24:42] let us this year be an open book we talk
[1:24:45] about an open book we talk about an open
[1:24:46] book well you be an open book
[1:24:49] and become yielded to the spirit to hear
[1:24:51] and know let's just right here
[1:24:53] as i have already said this book
[1:24:55] revelation
[1:24:57] is the consummation of the scriptures
[1:24:58] now we talked about both seeds started
[1:25:00] in genesis and they intertwined each
[1:25:01] other but when we come to the end time
[1:25:03] they've separated
[1:25:06] and it took a prophet to call us out
[1:25:10] and say not say and say your bride but
[1:25:12] say you're wheat
[1:25:15] you're weak they're not wheat they're
[1:25:17] tares
[1:25:20] look it is even placed exactly right in
[1:25:23] the canon of scripture what at the very
[1:25:25] end
[1:25:26] now you can know why it says that anyone
[1:25:28] who reads it or even hears it is blessed
[1:25:31] it is the revelation of god that will
[1:25:33] give you authority
[1:25:36] over the devil and you can see why they
[1:25:39] who would add or take from it would be
[1:25:41] cursed
[1:25:42] because you take and add to it that
[1:25:44] becomes a denomination
[1:25:46] or you take from it it would have to be
[1:25:49] so for who can add or take away from the
[1:25:52] perfect
[1:25:53] revelation of god and overcome the enemy
[1:25:57] it is that simple watch this right here
[1:26:00] there is nothing
[1:26:01] of such prevailing power you want power
[1:26:05] you want power over the devil there is
[1:26:08] nothing of such prevailing power
[1:26:10] as the revelation of the word
[1:26:14] nothing we can have sensations we can
[1:26:16] have feelings musicians come we have all
[1:26:18] these different things
[1:26:20] but the prevailing power is when god
[1:26:22] gives you a revelation
[1:26:24] that that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:26:27] let's stand to our feet
[1:26:31] it's going to be a separating time glory
[1:26:41] and you may be deceived listen judas
[1:26:43] deceived him right up to the very end
[1:26:46] but he had to show his colors he had to
[1:26:48] show his tear
[1:26:50] his ta he was tear and he never changed
[1:26:54] he just hit himself but see as
[1:26:57] satan hides himself god also hides
[1:27:00] himself and reveals himself
[1:27:02] in you
[1:27:06] you're the living word of god there is
[1:27:08] no other
[1:27:09] on this earth there is no living word of
[1:27:12] god except you
[1:27:14] oh you have all these different no the
[1:27:16] only living word
[1:27:18] of god on this earth at this moment is
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:22] the bride of jesus christ the true bride
[1:27:24] of jesus christ
[1:27:25] is the spokesman of god on the earth
[1:27:29] that's why i tell you sisters you think
[1:27:30] oh i'll have nothing to do.
[1:27:32] you go out in the world and be a light
[1:27:34] you're going to condemn millions
[1:27:37] but you just might get eternal life
[1:27:39] given to some poor guy or somebody that
[1:27:41] is kind to you or even looks at you and
[1:27:44] says
[1:27:44] we had a guy a local guy come by and
[1:27:48] jim was getting something off of the
[1:27:50] shelf and he walked by this way and he
[1:27:52] stopped
[1:27:53] i saw him i knew he was he turned back
[1:27:55] like this and he looked
[1:27:56] when i see most centers would be looking
[1:27:57] for you know what a good-looking woman
[1:28:00] or something
[1:28:02] well he was looking at a good-looking
[1:28:03] woman my wife but he walked down there
[1:28:06] and he said god bless you sister
[1:28:08] he said you're a godly looking woman
[1:28:12] he's pentecostal but he sees all this
[1:28:15] other junk and he sees how pentecost has
[1:28:17] come to where
[1:28:18] you know the girls women you can't tell
[1:28:19] them from the world
[1:28:21] but when somebody like that you make a
[1:28:23] statement
[1:28:25] that's the word made flesh you've made
[1:28:28] that part of the word
[1:28:29] real that's right so this time today
[1:28:33] tonight from this day forward until we
[1:28:35] get out of here
[1:28:36] let's make this word real gloria don't
[1:28:39] just go through the motions well i gotta
[1:28:41] go church sunday and i gotta go to
[1:28:42] church wednesday
[1:28:44] i gotta play my instrument tonight
[1:28:46] because my mom and daddy made me
[1:28:49] no you walk up here and say god i'm
[1:28:51] gonna do the best i can do
[1:28:53] and i don't care if they like it i'm
[1:28:55] doing it for you
[1:28:57] i'm going to sit in this pew and i'm
[1:28:58] going to say hallelujah praise the lord
[1:29:00] i'm going to raise my hand
[1:29:01] i don't care if somebody around me does
[1:29:04] because i'm doing it for you
[1:29:07] i'm not doing it for anybody else we're
[1:29:09] not here for a public show
[1:29:12] we're here though to let god be known
[1:29:15] by those two spirits being separated
[1:29:19] and whether the world sees it
[1:29:22] or you see it god sees it glory god
[1:29:25] sees what's in your heart that's why he
[1:29:29] was he the david was a troubled man
[1:29:34] sure he was a murderer he had his best
[1:29:36] friend killed so he could
[1:29:38] he could have his wife that's pretty
[1:29:40] tough
[1:29:42] but god knew in the heart of david
[1:29:46] if that little evil that was there
[1:29:49] because there was no new birth
[1:29:51] if that was removed he'd have never done
[1:29:53] that right and god knew that he was the
[1:29:55] only one who knew that that's why he
[1:29:56] could say
[1:29:57] david is the apple of my eye you don't
[1:29:59] we don't know how much david cried and
[1:30:01] wept and prayed
[1:30:02] and said god forgive me i'm sorry i just
[1:30:04] had a weak moment
[1:30:06] and god said i know i know you did
[1:30:10] i know down in your heart but i believe
[1:30:12] he told david you look in the psalms
[1:30:13] there's one
[1:30:14] i'm coming i'm coming
[1:30:17] and i'm gonna clean all this whole thing
[1:30:19] up from the old testament all the way to
[1:30:21] the new testament
[1:30:22] i'm coming myself he was wounded for my
[1:30:25] transgression
[1:30:26] he was brewed from my iniquity the
[1:30:28] chastisement
[1:30:29] of my piece of appointment by his
[1:30:31] stripes
[1:30:32] i'm going to be healed david you don't
[1:30:34] worry you're going to make it david
[1:30:37] by the skin of your teeth you're going
[1:30:38] to make it
[1:30:40] but there's going to be a group that's
[1:30:42] going to read you
[1:30:43] and going to know that that's me that
[1:30:45] was right now right
[1:30:47] turn right to the book of psalms psalm
[1:30:48] 48
[1:30:51] that psalm is to me and you it's a
[1:30:52] prayer that david's saying to god but
[1:30:54] how many times do we sing that prayer to
[1:30:56] him
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:58] five or six thousand years after it was
[1:31:00] written it's still just as fresh today
[1:31:01] as it was yesterday
[1:31:03] amen you love lord amen so the two
[1:31:06] spirits
[1:31:07] they're working in the framework of the
[1:31:08] church and there's only one way
[1:31:10] is a prevailing revelation which means
[1:31:12] not just
[1:31:14] well you know i believe that that that
[1:31:16] that father son holy ghost baptism is
[1:31:18] wrong
[1:31:19] now brother brown said that's just the
[1:31:20] ability to read because it says in the
[1:31:22] bible
[1:31:24] but you got to know where that come from
[1:31:26] know
[1:31:28] that that's wrong and know that to be
[1:31:31] baptized named lord jesus christ is the
[1:31:33] correct
[1:31:33] scriptural way to be baptized right amen
[1:31:36] that's why i just may cover a few of the
[1:31:38] of the major doctrines like that not to
[1:31:41] me see to
[1:31:41] us they're not measure the common we can
[1:31:43] just go through them and go well the
[1:31:44] bible says
[1:31:45] acts 2 38 well why does it say it says
[1:31:49] in
[1:31:49] acts 2 38 why does the whole world
[1:31:53] not baptize like that yet it's in plain
[1:31:55] english and we look at it and go
[1:31:56] thank you lord remember the first time
[1:31:59] you saw water baptism
[1:32:01] you said oh thank you lord right it's
[1:32:03] been there the whole time
[1:32:06] by your name we will be known
[1:32:09] the whole name of heaven and earth is
[1:32:11] named jesus not father not son not a
[1:32:13] holy ghost
[1:32:15] but it was hidden though except to a
[1:32:18] small group of people
[1:32:19] because it's deceived the whole world
[1:32:22] into believing that's what you're
[1:32:23] supposed to do
[1:32:24] right that's what we're talking about
[1:32:25] the two spirits so let's go forward this
[1:32:27] year
[1:32:28] let's pray that god listen them two
[1:32:30] spirits reside in you
[1:32:33] not in your soul but you've got a spirit
[1:32:35] realm
[1:32:36] that he can work in those five senses
[1:32:39] that other spirit
[1:32:40] can try to get you to do things that you
[1:32:41] don't want to do young people
[1:32:43] all of us but we have an advocate
[1:32:47] and where's that advocate it's not over
[1:32:48] the under somewhere that advocates right
[1:32:51] here inside of you
[1:32:52] this is where judgment begins right here
[1:32:55] because this is the house of god this is
[1:32:58] not the house of god this is where
[1:32:59] people that are of the house of god come
[1:33:02] and worship
[1:33:02] because it doesn't matter we worship
