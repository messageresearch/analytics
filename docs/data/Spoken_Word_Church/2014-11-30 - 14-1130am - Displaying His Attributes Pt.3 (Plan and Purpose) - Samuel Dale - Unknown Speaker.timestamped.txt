[14:41] all announcements uh what have I
[14:45] got oh uh on the watch Night Service now
[14:49] make sure you uh you know how we do we
[14:51] generally have services to start with
[14:54] like regular starting at

[15:00] minister ministers and then we have
[15:03] singing testimonies Etc on up till
[15:06] midnight so remember that and have your
[15:09] songs ready your things you know that
[15:11] you're doing have everything uh in order
[15:14] so that will be able to do that all
[15:17] right Matthew
[15:22] 19 forgive me today if I have to blow
[15:24] and huff and puff but you know how that
[15:27] is he's
[15:29] sinus problems and things but you know
[15:33] we'll get
[15:34] through Matthew
[15:36] 19 verse three the Pharisees also came
[15:40] unto him tempting him and saying unto
[15:44] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[15:47] his wife for every cause now remember
[15:50] that and watch the scripture now and he
[15:53] answered and said unto them have you not
[15:55] read that he which made them at the
[15:57] beginning made them May and
[15:59] female and said for this cause shall a
[16:02] man leave his father and mother and
[16:04] shall cleave to his wife and they twain
[16:07] shall be one flesh now he didn't say
[16:10] wives cuz he's getting over into the
[16:14] laying in
[16:15] order all right wherefore there are no
[16:17] more Twain but one flesh what therefore
[16:21] God hath joined together let not man put
[16:23] a they say unto him why did Moses then
[16:27] command to give a writing a divorcement
[16:29] and to put her away and Jesus said unto
[16:32] them Moses because of the hardness of
[16:34] your hearts suffered you to put away
[16:37] your wives but from the beginning it was
[16:40] not so and I say unto you whosoever
[16:43] shall put away his wife except it be for
[16:45] fornication and shall marry another
[16:47] committeth adultery and whoo Marth her
[16:50] which is put away does commit adultery
[16:54] you may be seated the Lord add his
[16:55] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[16:58] we're not dealing with necessarily
[17:02] trying to minister about uh marriage and
[17:06] divorce Etc but trying to uh get some
[17:11] things in order to uh give us a better
[17:14] understanding now uh I wish you a lot of
[17:18] you had went with us Friday night and I
[17:21] condemn you for it because we went they
[17:24] had probably 200 people in a building
[17:28] then
[17:29] and there was no out of order things
[17:32] everything was in good shape and running
[17:34] good I really liked it I like their
[17:37] worship they came in came to the altar
[17:40] children from 5 years old and up they
[17:43] came to the Altar and they prayed before
[17:45] the service the men the women everybody
[17:48] comes to the altar they you know they're
[17:50] well uh
[17:52] trained and in all of that group there
[17:54] was no children hollering and screaming
[17:57] and problem going on it was real quiet
[18:00] we were kind of laughing about the
[18:02] deacons walked to sides and all and I
[18:05] told Terrence he'd have to straddle the
[18:06] seats over you know on each side here
[18:09] but you know we don't have that type of
[18:12] building but my point is uh you know
[18:15] we've got a lot of little children here
[18:17] and I've been able to say something for
[18:19] quite a while we've got a lot of little
[18:21] babies little kids all right now
[18:26] uh before you had those children you
[18:30] used to turn around and snarl and get
[18:32] upset cuz everybody else's kids was uh
[18:35] making a racket cuz it was disturbing
[18:39] you but you know after you get your own
[18:41] kids you just don't hear them something
[18:43] cuts off ton it you just don't pay
[18:46] attention to it you just kind of let it
[18:48] go you know but you know everybody else
[18:50] around there has not that way they're
[18:52] still turning around snarling their nose
[18:54] and and looking now I've tried to make
[18:57] myself clear
[18:59] babies crying doesn't bother me but
[19:03] crying for quite a bit take them out
[19:06] take care of them whatever the need is
[19:09] take care of them and quien them down we
[19:12] have a nursery for that that you can
[19:15] keep them in but just don't keep on
[19:18] letting them cry because you know and
[19:20] they're they're expected to say goo goo
[19:22] g d d you know we train them to do that
[19:26] but you know just don't let them disturb
[19:28] the people around you you know take them
[19:31] to the nursery take them out whatever
[19:34] you got to do with them you know we're
[19:36] still in the days I know they don't
[19:37] agree with it with the law but I still
[19:39] believe if you'll bring you a little
[19:41] switch you can correct a lot of problems
[19:44] you know and you just kind of do a
[19:46] little tapping and you know it kind of
[19:48] gets to it the other day they I had to
[19:51] go to the doctor and they gave me a
[19:52] couple of shots Well the lady gave me
[19:54] the shots in the wrong place I said it's
[19:56] not back there that's bothering me it's
[19:58] my throat you know but you know you can
[20:01] always just kind of get people's
[20:03] attention the little kids you know by
[20:05] tapping them just a little bit you know
[20:08] and you know don't let them play with
[20:10] things that make a
[20:11] racket you know you you get to Rattlers
[20:14] you get the paper rattling you get you
[20:16] know to do don't don't do that that
[20:18] distracts everybody around you you know
[20:21] we're supposed to be doing everything
[20:23] decently in an order all right and see
[20:26] that way then like I've always said I
[20:29] don't have trouble with the
[20:30] babies I have trouble with the
[20:33] adults that snarl up and do their things
[20:37] because you know that they're doing and
[20:39] well you can always move to the
[20:41] front and it's designed for the kids in
[20:44] the back that they're you know uh
[20:46] specifically stated for the children you
[20:48] know in the back and and let your kids
[20:51] be back there and and it doesn't bother
[20:53] everybody but see you're going to sit in
[20:55] your seat and snarl up and pout all all
[20:58] the way through the service and I can't
[21:00] hear well you're you're hindering the
[21:01] service more than the baby is am all
[21:04] right that's right I try to be decently
[21:06] and in order and put everything in the
[21:08] straight in the line you know to make it
[21:10] work out because we don't want to be
[21:13] distracting to everybody around us we
[21:16] want to be you know to where we can can
[21:20] enjoy the service and like I said we try
[21:23] to provide you a place you know and
[21:25] don't let the kids be playing with
[21:27] Rattlers and ERS and towing things and
[21:29] doing things take care of them because
[21:32] that's that's what you should be wanting
[21:34] to do you come to want to hear and you
[21:37] know and we didn't really come to church
[21:39] to hear the kids make a racket we come
[21:42] to enjoy the word of God and try to you
[21:46] know do and brother brandham said even a
[21:48] child running to the church between
[21:52] Services now listen he said would hinder
[21:55] the next service coming on
[21:59] now you say well boy is God that back
[22:01] well you talk to him I didn't say that
[22:06] your Prophet says it you know so you go
[22:09] talk to God about it if you if you think
[22:11] that you know thing so if you get your
[22:13] feelings hurt make sure just get them
[22:15] hurt at me if the deacons calm you down
[22:17] a little bit about it or call you down
[22:20] remember uh um I'm the one telling them
[22:23] what to do okay so we put it in that
[22:26] order just try to keep everything quiet
[22:27] as possible
[22:28] and try to worship and have a good time
[22:31] and all like that in in the Lord and
[22:33] don't try to hinder those that are
[22:36] around you I've warned you over and over
[22:38] brother randam said one
[22:41] person could cause the church to
[22:44] bitterly fail now you come in here with
[22:48] your petty little feelings and your
[22:51] little sorry the words sarus attitudes
[22:53] you know and do and sit down you're
[22:56] hindering the people around around you
[22:59] right that Spirit get is getting off of
[23:01] you onto other people and I've warned
[23:03] you over and over
[23:05] now that spirit is getting off on people
[23:08] around
[23:09] you all right and when it does it causes
[23:12] them to set and pout and spewed and you
[23:16] know well that's your business now
[23:20] you've been worned from the pull pit
[23:22] some of you have been approached
[23:24] personally and I'm telling you
[23:28] that's your
[23:29] responsibility that's between you and
[23:33] God I'm not going to a church with a bad
[23:36] attitude I just won't
[23:39] go I just won't go at all I'll just go
[23:42] off to myself and forget it cuz if I
[23:44] can't do nothing with my attitude then I
[23:48] need to be somewhere else praying right
[23:51] all right so I pray that you take that
[23:54] as a heart of love but if not take it as
[23:57] dirty owe
[23:59] me cuz we should be everything should be
[24:02] done decently in order and like I said I
[24:06] wish you would have been there we sat
[24:08] and looked around one baby said a few
[24:11] words and the Deacon got up and went
[24:13] around the baby didn't say no
[24:17] more I
[24:19] mean I thought we were supposed to be
[24:23] coming here to serve God Amen and to so
[24:27] you know now don't come in my office
[24:29] after a while and ask me am I talking
[24:30] about you because I'll say yes I'll just
[24:33] put a sign on the front door before you
[24:35] enter it says
[24:37] yes okay and let's prob solve the whole
[24:41] problem okay all right but now think
[24:44] about it what have we been talking about
[24:46] as I said we're not dealing with say
[24:49] marriage and
[24:50] divorce uh We've covered serieses on
[24:53] those before and things but we're
[24:56] talking about something that I believe
[24:58] is very uh
[25:00] needful for the time that we are are
[25:04] here and and the things to understand
[25:08] and and follow in the line of
[25:11] understanding to to uh help us to walk
[25:15] into the light that we see all right now
[25:19] we talked about the last couple of
[25:22] services that and we'll keep going
[25:24] through this that brother brandham says
[25:28] polygamy was
[25:31] permitted it was
[25:33] introduced into the human
[25:36] race and I ask you the question you know
[25:39] up front is why would it be the way that
[25:42] it is because Eve was the one that done
[25:45] the wrong see Eve had too many partners
[25:49] herself it wasn't
[25:52] Adam right now Adam he didn't have too
[25:57] many
[25:58] wives you know but you say well you know
[26:01] Eve didn't have well you argue all you
[26:03] want to I said Partners where you can
[26:05] just leave it
[26:07] alone but you see because of her doing
[26:10] what she done cuz we don't have to go
[26:13] through the serpent Seed doctrine we
[26:14] know what happened in the garden we know
[26:16] that you know Eve had a relationship
[26:18] with the Beast and those on the internet
[26:21] that don't know about that just remember
[26:22] what I've said every time remember I
[26:24] preach to my
[26:26] people if you're going to listen that's
[26:28] your business but don't call me up and
[26:30] want to fuss with me about because of
[26:32] something I say because I I preach what
[26:34] I believe to my people and you can sit
[26:37] and listen do what you want to you know
[26:39] or turn it off that's your choice
[26:42] but see why would it be that polygamy
[26:45] would be
[26:46] introduced you
[26:48] know what would be the uh the dealings
[26:52] when now and I gave the definition cuz
[26:54] the word polygamy can mean too many
[26:56] wives or can mean too many husbands so
[26:59] don't technically play with me on words
[27:02] I gave the definition because it does
[27:04] mean it that way uh you can say well
[27:06] it's bames it's Isam and no you get into
[27:09] all other kind of words I'm sure they
[27:10] got modern words today to bring up how
[27:13] many wives is too much or how many
[27:16] husbands is too much but I'm not
[27:18] educated enough to do that so I just
[27:20] stick with what you know the prophet has
[27:22] said in the Bible and try to use that
[27:25] terminology but didn't you ever think
[27:27] about it
[27:29] that because of Eve doing the
[27:34] wrong God permits polygamy to come into
[27:39] being all
[27:41] right I mean is that um as I said is
[27:45] that condemning the
[27:48] woman is it meaning that God is mad at
[27:51] her and she's done this wrong so he's
[27:55] mad at her so he's going to get out of
[27:58] her he's going to make her go into these
[28:01] polygamy you know to where that uh you
[28:05] know it would be
[28:08] permitted or what is it and I ask you
[28:11] the question we'll get around to it in
[28:12] just a
[28:14] minute
[28:17] uh if
[28:19] polygamy is what it
[28:22] is then now listen to the
[28:26] wording we know that the
[28:29] fall we'll get to God's plan and purpose
[28:31] in a minute you know to express his
[28:35] himself and to be a Healer a savior a
[28:38] redeemer Etc all right now because of
[28:42] the
[28:43] Fall those
[28:45] attributes can be displayed right all
[28:49] right because of the fall all right so
[28:52] we got it right now what Eve done wrong
[28:55] she done it and and God didn't make that
[29:00] happen remember we went through that God
[29:03] cannot make you sin and condemn you for
[29:05] being a sinner so he puts you on free
[29:08] moral agency to accept or reject all
[29:12] right so then Eve when she rejected she
[29:15] went into the wrong thing and when she
[29:18] did see then the wrong made an
[29:23] opportunity um maybe not good language
[29:26] but best I got
[29:27] uh it gave an opportunity for God to
[29:30] display his
[29:31] attributes all right which was his plan
[29:34] and purpose now what not his plan to
[29:36] make us
[29:38] fall now don't go that way see you're
[29:42] getting into the wrong Avenue if you
[29:44] think God made this
[29:46] happen no he knew it would
[29:50] happen right and he permitted it to
[29:54] happen to where that he could display
[29:56] his attrib
[29:57] then there's nothing wrong amen see it's
[30:01] lined up correctly in the word of God
[30:03] all right but then when it comes down
[30:06] see to the point that he has the ability
[30:09] to display his attributes why would
[30:11] polygamy be
[30:13] allowed permitted or whatever the words
[30:15] you want to
[30:17] use uh
[30:20] polygamy now listen carefully polygamy
[30:25] is not a display of God
[30:28] attributes you say yes it is cuz he
[30:31] don't no no no wait a minute now see
[30:33] you're making him the
[30:35] author so be careful now we'll get back
[30:38] to this in a minute but be careful see
[30:41] you say well polygamy displayed his
[30:44] attribute what what attribute did God
[30:46] display by allowing
[30:53] polygamy that's a simple question I'd
[30:56] like a simple
[31:00] answer polygamy cannot be the perfect
[31:04] will of
[31:05] God sin in the garden was not the
[31:09] perfect will of
[31:11] God am I right sin came because of their
[31:17] being put to where they were that he
[31:19] knew that if he put them that way that
[31:22] they would fall yes but he could not
[31:24] make them fall and condemn them for
[31:27] being wrong that's
[31:29] right you can't do that with God that's
[31:32] what your Prophet had to
[31:33] say all right but see then when you come
[31:36] to
[31:38] polygamy remember the reason polygamy is
[31:41] brought into being or allowed was as a
[31:49] type as a type now and a type is not a
[31:54] display of an attribute necessarily
[31:56] because you you start in a negative form
[31:59] of applying the type all right now so
[32:05] then if what Eve done
[32:08] wrong would would bring into being the
[32:11] attributes of God is savior healer etc
[32:13] etc or make a way that that would come
[32:15] into being then we must deal with
[32:18] polygamy as not a display of an
[32:20] attribute like a Healer a savior this or
[32:23] that or the other but as a
[32:26] type
[32:28] that would be there to display then his
[32:32] plan and purpose in its
[32:35] fullness are you with me yes you can say
[32:39] well I I like to display I like to well
[32:41] go ahead play your
[32:45] games you see I say these and then after
[32:47] a while I'll drop down and drive a nail
[32:50] and you miss the
[32:52] nail all right but I can't help that see
[32:57] polygamy was
[33:02] wrong right
[33:05] now why would it be that
[33:08] polygamy would fall into the animal
[33:17] race am I right the first polygamy was
[33:20] who Lage come over and had two wi and
[33:23] that's on over into Genesis a little bit
[33:25] no telling how many uh hundreds of years
[33:28] or whatever it took place to get it dire
[33:30] two years what's the
[33:31] difference lame was the first one that
[33:34] had two
[33:35] wives see Adam didn't have two
[33:38] wives
[33:40] no he chose to stay where he was
[33:44] at okay now we want to take Adam and
[33:47] make him into a type of Christ be real
[33:49] careful there because remember Adam went
[33:52] into the wrong now Christ don't go into
[33:55] the wrong to redeem us right did you
[33:57] catch the nail it just drove it down so
[34:00] you're setting with your own thoughts
[34:02] all right now so
[34:05] then let's talk about polygamy as being
[34:09] a
[34:10] type of God's plan and
[34:15] purpose because before the
[34:17] world he knew what he was going to do or
[34:20] he's not God is that true I mean that's
[34:23] that's
[34:24] sensible all right he knew if he made
[34:27] man put them on co-equal our free moral
[34:30] agency whatever words you want to
[34:33] use that they would go wrong but he
[34:36] could not now I keep emphasizing that
[34:39] because I know how the human mind cuts
[34:41] off I say something your mind cuts off
[34:43] it don't click back in till after
[34:49] while whose's mind clicked in I didn't
[34:51] get no
[34:53] amen right is your mind clicked in yet
[34:55] how about saying amen
[34:58] because that's the way we do oh no I can
[34:59] keep up with everything you say and I
[35:01] can write down everything you say I'm
[35:04] sorry we are not speed
[35:08] typist right that's
[35:11] right you write down notes just try just
[35:13] a little note don't try to write the
[35:15] whole sentence because you're going to
[35:16] lose what I'm saying that's right all
[35:19] right now clinch and nail is what I try
[35:23] to
[35:24] do and then to me yeah I just don't have
[35:28] nowhere else to go maybe you do and
[35:31] maybe you're thinking but when I see
[35:33] something to the positive point then
[35:36] that's clenching the nail and it's
[35:38] finished all right now polygamy was
[35:43] wrong and cannot be a display of his
[35:48] attributes now did that clinch that nail
[35:51] where a while ago you was thinking it
[35:53] could be his display of his
[35:55] attributes now the display of that's
[35:57] future savior healer deliverer all of
[35:59] that's
[36:00] covered that covers all of his doings
[36:03] except for one thing his plan and his
[36:08] purpose see his plan and his purpose was
[36:11] not to just be a
[36:13] Healer a
[36:15] redeemer you know that's not all of
[36:19] God's plan and
[36:22] purpose that's just a part that's we
[36:25] look at right that makes us into the
[36:29] wrong thoughts now we know these things
[36:31] but just in case go ahead brother and
[36:34] pull up just pull up number two because
[36:37] from Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[36:38] brother R said God had a three-fold
[36:40] purpose in his great mystery
[36:43] secret his great mystery secret that he
[36:46] had before the world begun he's got a
[36:48] three-fold purpose in it what was it
[36:50] first to express himself completely God
[36:53] in
[36:54] Christ all right there's your healer
[36:57] your savior your Redeemer your all and
[37:00] all second to have the
[37:03] preeminence by this in his
[37:06] church see amen which is his body the
[37:10] bride till he could have the preeminence
[37:13] to express himself through them I like
[37:15] that till he could have he starts off he
[37:18] works it finally gets it we'll get to
[37:21] that in a moment all
[37:22] right
[37:24] now sin and death it's separated him
[37:27] from the his presence and his entire
[37:31] expression all right before the
[37:33] foundation of the world his expression
[37:34] was what his his his
[37:37] attributes what he was all right now
[37:41] when he displays his
[37:44] attributes you can't take an attribute
[37:47] I'm trying to drive that
[37:49] hard you you want to make an attribute
[37:52] to be something you know in doing it but
[37:54] to remember you cannot have sin as an
[38:00] attribute see so if God is the author of
[38:02] sin we might as well forget it and go
[38:05] home right because nobody's got a hope
[38:08] will join your Catholic church and kiss
[38:09] the Pope's toe and forget it you say you
[38:13] ought not talk like that why not it's
[38:15] the
[38:17] truth but to see that he will use
[38:21] something for his own
[38:25] benefit
[38:27] is a wonderful
[38:29] situation so it permitted man to
[38:33] fall and that way he could come in
[38:36] Christ to
[38:39] redeem be but before Christ would get
[38:43] here you know I'm talking about Jesus
[38:45] the flesh coming 2,000 years ago to die
[38:47] for our sins we see that his plan and
[38:51] his
[38:52] purpose was already beginning to
[38:55] unfold right and he
[38:59] permitted polygamy to enter the
[39:03] situation all right and in doing that he
[39:08] would set in
[39:11] motion something that would be a
[39:13] beautiful situation once it was
[39:16] finished but would take a long time
[39:18] 6,000
[39:20] years to bring it forth and then
[39:23] polygamy would be allowed to be a
[39:27] type of Christ and his
[39:31] church all right so we see then
[39:35] David 700
[39:37] wives right Solomon
[39:41] thousand but you know what not a one of
[39:44] those women could have another
[39:48] man there's no
[39:52] way you said well that would be a
[39:54] horrible situation to be married to a
[39:55] man had a thousand wiv he probably get
[39:58] to say hi to you about once every 3
[40:00] years but I don't have nothing to do
[40:03] with
[40:05] it now don't
[40:08] misunderstand because God will allow
[40:11] things to
[40:14] happen that are not his perfect
[40:17] will amen all right but then he can turn
[40:22] around and take that permissive
[40:25] will
[40:28] right and make it his perfect
[40:31] will
[40:33] okay because it can all come out in the
[40:35] correct order all right that's number
[40:37] three go ahead brother Joe and then I
[40:41] never know who's on the pole back there
[40:42] to pull the levers so what did he say
[40:45] does God just change his mind about his
[40:48] word but if the people won't walk in his
[40:51] perfect will he does have a permissive
[40:53] will he let you walk in notice he
[40:57] permits it all right but he will make it
[40:59] work out for his glory in his perfect
[41:01] will now if you like just like in the
[41:03] beginning it was not God's perfect will
[41:05] for children to be born on the Earth
[41:07] through sex no
[41:09] sir God created Man Out of the Dust of
[41:12] the earth breathe the breath of life
[41:13] into him and he became a living Soul he
[41:16] took from that man a helpmate and made a
[41:19] wife to him that was God's first and
[41:22] original
[41:25] will now are you following me I
[41:28] emphasize those things that was God's
[41:30] first and original will what Adam and
[41:34] Eve is
[41:36] one children do not be born by
[41:40] sex right spiritual
[41:44] multiplication not by
[41:46] sex every how you want to run all your
[41:50] other things think about
[41:53] it but when sin come in and did the
[41:56] thing that he did that it did then he
[41:59] permitted man to marry a wife legally
[42:02] and have children by her multiply and
[42:04] replenish the Earth then if that's the
[42:06] way you're going to do it but you see it
[42:08] never was his perfect will all right it
[42:11] was not his perfect will for babies to
[42:14] be born by
[42:16] sex we use the word sex as a word
[42:19] meaning intercourse all right it was
[42:22] never meant to be that way it was meant
[42:25] to be
[42:27] and we'll get to that in a moment
[42:28] because that's what Jesus is referring
[42:30] back to when he says goes back to the
[42:33] beginning watch him he covers it to to
[42:35] make the point all right now to make
[42:40] sure you don't misunderstand me I put
[42:42] this on each way go ahead with number
[42:44] number four and then we'll get number
[42:46] five because we do not believe in
[42:49] polygamy yeah you out there anybody else
[42:52] believe what you want
[42:54] to but
[42:57] if you're that
[42:58] blind you're on your bed to hell anyway
[43:02] so go ahead enjoy yourself that's
[43:05] right because you don't have anything
[43:07] for your after that's right well now pgy
[43:10] was put there and show me where done
[43:12] away we will do that it was done away in
[43:17] Christ right or else you got a problem
[43:22] okay so watch what he says on the 70th
[43:24] week of Daniel preaching 61 806 in the
[43:27] Nations now you know what he's talking
[43:29] about he says in America we have more
[43:32] divorces Etc and and I read you one the
[43:35] other day where he said because we're
[43:37] trying to make people follow a Bible
[43:40] terminologies when it's the law of the
[43:43] land right see the law of the land
[43:45] allows all kind of things but we're
[43:48] trying to make it work by the Bible and
[43:50] you can't do that so he said in the
[43:52] Nations where polygamy was legal he said
[43:55] it's better off
[43:57] but then he makes his point in the
[43:59] Nations where they have polygamy is a
[44:01] thousand times
[44:02] better and yet polygamy is wrong we know
[44:07] all right see now we know it's wrong all
[44:09] right go to the next one this is taken
[44:12] from the the
[44:14] supernatural preaching 56 uh
[44:18] 129 and he's bringing in explaining
[44:20] Christianity doctrin outside the world
[44:23] coincide with Christian doctrine you
[44:24] can't put nature of a lamb the pig say
[44:27] polygamy be better off you may not
[44:29] believe it but God would look at
[44:31] polygamy and then excuse it a lot
[44:33] quicker than what he
[44:36] would that's pretty strong is
[44:40] it CU we all of our lives have been
[44:44] taught polygamy was wrong right and it's
[44:47] true it is
[44:48] wrong but what about a prophet
[44:52] saying things would be better in a
[44:54] nation with this thing
[44:57] but yet he makes his
[44:59] plain now remember don't you say that I
[45:01] believe in polygamy I
[45:04] don't all right
[45:07] now so
[45:09] then he doesn't believe in
[45:14] polygamy and not believing in it we
[45:16] don't believe in it but we didn't
[45:19] believe in it before we believe what he
[45:20] believed in it uh I never did like the
[45:23] idea of too many wies
[45:27] and I've never liked the idea the way
[45:29] that 99% of them are done because you
[45:32] got an old man with a whole bunch of
[45:33] young
[45:34] women now you don't have old women with
[45:38] a young
[45:40] man right that ought to let you know
[45:44] through the brain without going anywhere
[45:47] else that ought not have to be revealed
[45:49] to you you don't need a light bub to be
[45:52] turned on you don't see a 20-y old boy
[45:55] marrying a 40 year old woman unless
[45:57] she's
[46:00] Rich
[46:02] right all right but you
[46:05] see you say well well what about this
[46:08] that the other well what about
[46:12] it see because polygamy then would be
[46:16] wrong and the reason it would be wrong
[46:19] is
[46:20] because now we're talking about polygamy
[46:22] now we're not talking about it was
[46:24] permitted back there everybody
[46:26] understand me I told you last week we
[46:28] stayed in the Old
[46:29] Testament we're moving toward the New
[46:31] Testament now all right see then that
[46:34] polygamy was allowed to type Christ in
[46:38] the church true amen all right but now
[46:43] when you come to Christ in the
[46:45] church you see why the prophet would say
[46:47] we don't believe in
[46:49] polygamy
[46:51] why because you no longer need the type
[46:55] right
[46:57] come on
[46:58] Amen once you've reached the top you got
[47:02] tops and shadows you got type you got
[47:04] what is the word I always miss it is
[47:06] antitype which means a fulfillment of
[47:09] the type and one of them there you can
[47:10] go anti and other go anti and you got
[47:12] the wrong word what I mean by it is that
[47:16] you've got something typing it but when
[47:19] you reach the per the perfect wheel then
[47:23] you're no longer typing in that basis we
[47:27] will get to it in a minute that even a
[47:29] man and his wife is a type of Christ in
[47:32] the church but that's why we read the
[47:34] scripture yes sir it's not man and his
[47:37] wives today right that are a type of
[47:40] Christ in the church see you're going in
[47:43] the wrong direction all right but now
[47:46] think about
[47:49] it then when the church came into being
[47:52] on the day of
[47:54] Pentecost you had the
[47:56] Fulfillment of all of that that was
[48:00] spoke of by David Solomon the you know
[48:03] the different polygamy part and you had
[48:07] it fulfilled in the bride of Christ to
[48:11] be a many membered body right
[48:16] correct all
[48:17] right and in that many membered
[48:22] body you would have it not as many
[48:31] wives you have it as one wife right
[48:34] right now I hold that one wife because
[48:36] we can't say wives I know how people
[48:39] think amen I know what you're running on
[48:41] your computers out there on the outside
[48:43] listening in he just don't understand
[48:46] well I guess I
[48:47] don't but let's see if it's right and
[48:51] then I'm always open for understanding
[48:55] you know
[48:56] all right so once you reach the point of
[48:58] typing Christ in the
[49:00] church what would polygamy have to do
[49:03] with
[49:11] it once you reach typing Christ in the
[49:14] church there is something that we're
[49:17] holding yes that we go with this but
[49:21] holding it to the
[49:23] point because look what Paul Paul
[49:28] says go ahead with number 5
[49:31] a look what Paul
[49:36] says you remember Paul's in the New
[49:38] Testament in case you know you say well
[49:41] you ought not be that carnal I'm carnal
[49:43] with a
[49:45] carnal you know I talked to a man one
[49:47] day and he said I don't know where
[49:49] brother brand said that or not I said
[49:51] hold on just a
[49:52] minute I'll get my computer running we
[49:55] find out well okay cuz he knew I could
[49:57] pull it up you but look look what he
[50:01] says in Ephesians now now this is Christ
[50:03] in the
[50:05] church for this cause shall a man leave
[50:07] his father and mother and shall join
[50:10] unto his
[50:13] wives uh is that what it says it says
[50:17] wife
[50:19] one and they too not 4 10 12 20 amen
[50:26] and they too shall be one
[50:29] flesh right that's simple isn't it is to
[50:34] me and look what he says this is a great
[50:37] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[50:40] and the
[50:41] church see once you reach Christ in the
[50:45] church you come to the the Fulfillment
[50:48] of the type case I use that word anti
[50:51] wrong you come to the Fulfillment of the
[50:53] type and you're no longer longer having
[50:55] to
[50:57] type you move to a beautiful
[51:02] type you move to one man and one woman
[51:06] amen right we're going to get with Jesus
[51:09] back in the beginning because he said
[51:11] that's where we're supposed to
[51:13] go right all right so then it's not many
[51:19] wives in the New Testament I gave you my
[51:23] definition just just the definition but
[51:25] brother brandham says Paul had a problem
[51:27] with marriage and divorce and he had to
[51:29] solve the problem right that's in the
[51:32] book marriage and divorce Moses had it
[51:33] Paul had it brother Rand you know all
[51:36] right and and and my honest I try to be
[51:39] that Paul wound up with probably some
[51:42] guy walking up there and said well Paul
[51:43] what I do I've accepted Jesus Christ as
[51:46] my savior I'm a Christian I'm born again
[51:49] but what am I going to do with these Wes
[51:51] that I got because remember polygamy was
[51:54] still legal at that time
[51:56] now what would you do if you was
[52:00] Paul well go take your seven and live
[52:02] with them now where you going to type
[52:05] Christ in the church that's right oh
[52:07] well that's one man and many wives no
[52:10] Paul just
[52:12] said one wife one husband one flesh amen
[52:19] amen all
[52:21] right now I'll give you my definition
[52:23] which is I think it's a good one
[52:26] I think Paul turned around to the man
[52:28] and said hey look you pick out one of
[52:31] them
[52:33] women ever what it is if it's your first
[52:36] one or whatever it's doing that's legal
[52:38] make it right and you take her home with
[52:41] you but you put them other six over you
[52:43] in the building and you don't have no
[52:45] relationship with them and you feed them
[52:48] you clothe them you raise the kids
[52:50] you've got by them right if you want to
[52:52] be a Christian that's right now you give
[52:55] me a better definition than
[52:57] that right don't you go live with
[53:00] them we don't believe in the people that
[53:03] walk down the road you know got their
[53:05] houses all
[53:07] out but think about
[53:13] it
[53:17] now he leaves his father and
[53:21] mother he goes with his wife singular
[53:28] and they're one flesh
[53:31] amen because you're not typing now
[53:35] listen to
[53:36] wording it's impossible to have Solomon
[53:39] with a thousand wives and they're all
[53:41] was his one body now I know the top so
[53:44] don't argue with me about what I'm
[53:46] saying listen to what I'm saying
[53:48] sensibly he had a th women
[53:53] right that was was
[53:56] fulfilled and typing
[53:59] right but he could not be one with all
[54:02] of them right you say yeah he was no
[54:06] they had to be one with him that's right
[54:09] because they could not have another
[54:11] husband he could go have number
[54:14] 1142
[54:16] right right
[54:19] right because it was legal so that's
[54:22] what I'm saying I clinch nails but you
[54:24] don't never see the nails okay one day
[54:27] it'll appear you said hey that's what he
[54:29] said
[54:31] okay so now think about it so we get to
[54:35] something that I love in a little way of
[54:38] understanding and I've always tried to
[54:40] explain this to you and uh you
[54:45] see by the new birth that came on the
[54:48] day of
[54:50] Pentecost the soul of that individual is
[54:53] made
[54:54] eternal
[54:55] you
[54:56] agree the soul is made Eternal by the
[54:58] new birth eternal life all right now in
[55:02] that Soul being made
[55:07] Eternal but it doesn't do away with our
[55:11] natural lives in what we've done that's
[55:16] where people can't follow
[55:18] that and you've never taught that
[55:22] because you were taught that just get to
[55:23] New Birth it takes care of everything
[55:25] cuz you was never worried about marriage
[55:26] and divorce right till you come in the
[55:28] message right you wasn't concerned about
[55:31] it you didn't have no thoughts about it
[55:33] you just you had somebody's opinion
[55:35] somebody's idea all
[55:37] right but you see the soul being
[55:44] Eternal but the body's not
[55:49] Eternal all
[55:52] right now follow a point with me
[55:57] see some of the things of the Old
[55:58] Testament still
[55:59] apply right there are some things of the
[56:02] Old Testament that still
[56:05] apply but remember my point now the new
[56:09] birth makes your soul
[56:11] Eternal it does not make your body nor
[56:13] your spirit Eternal right so we're going
[56:16] to have to deal with that as long as
[56:17] we're
[56:18] here all right well it don't make no
[56:21] difference what I do I'm born
[56:23] again
[56:26] okay go right ahead what are we doing
[56:29] here 50 years after the Prophet come
[56:32] that's one question I'd like to
[56:36] ask evidently it took a long time to get
[56:39] a lot of things straightened
[56:40] out that you know yourself what's in the
[56:45] message you see these men run off on
[56:48] their strange Doctrine they also run off
[56:50] with strange women and polygamy comes
[56:53] into view
[56:58] you think it's not in the message come
[57:00] on folks click on the internet and
[57:03] you'll find
[57:05] out I don't you listen to
[57:08] them and find
[57:10] out but now
[57:13] watch there's some things about the body
[57:18] that you're and I are going to have to
[57:19] deal with and I've always taught you
[57:21] because this is way I believe
[57:23] it I believe that the faith of the
[57:28] fathers what the apostles
[57:32] taught you know the Redemptive plan that
[57:36] Paul taught what happened in the garden
[57:39] and showing it and even showing the tops
[57:41] and the
[57:44] Shadows comes out to a perfect
[57:46] understanding
[57:47] of husband and wife right as now being a
[57:51] type of Christ in the
[57:53] church
[57:55] I will put this in here because I'm
[57:57] blunt not every man and woman is a type
[58:00] of Christ in the church because you
[58:03] can't have polygamy involved and still
[58:06] tring to type Christ in the church
[58:08] that's right you can't have one man now
[58:10] a whole bunch of wives or or one wife
[58:12] and a whole bunch of husbands it don't
[58:15] work we got to change things we're in
[58:18] the New
[58:19] Testament all right well what's our
[58:22] hopes our hopes is only in Jesus Christ
[58:27] right but now think about
[58:30] it the
[58:32] body we went out and done things
[58:38] wrong we married two or three times etc
[58:41] etc you know
[58:43] problems well do you think the new birth
[58:45] just automatically does away with that
[58:47] just it's just
[58:50] gone that's the form of organized
[58:53] religion and understanding
[58:56] and that's the form of a lot of people
[58:57] in this message that think the new birth
[59:01] takes care of the marital situation well
[59:04] why did Brother ROM preach marriage and
[59:05] divorce and declare Grace come on that's
[59:08] sensible I nailed a nail down but you
[59:11] didn't hear
[59:14] it but there are some things even
[59:19] though the new birth comes to the
[59:22] soul cuz I believe this
[59:26] message this message prophet's
[59:31] message the opening of the seals the
[59:34] things was to bring us to a bodily
[59:37] Redemption right the soul was
[59:41] Redeemed by the new
[59:43] birth all right you could heard you know
[59:45] you could have heard Jesus preach
[59:47] somewhere got born again out in under
[59:48] dominations and people don't think
[59:50] that's true but go read brother brandham
[59:52] put the dog over the egg and have C his
[59:55] egg forget it he said they could be you
[59:58] argue with
[59:59] him all
[1:00:01] right but you see there are some tail
[1:00:04] tale signs or whatever you want to call
[1:00:07] it what are we going to do with a
[1:00:09] situation of
[1:00:11] Paul with a guy that had seven
[1:00:14] wives you know what are you going to
[1:00:18] do you better study the message to find
[1:00:22] out some
[1:00:23] things but now
[1:00:25] there are some things that are left over
[1:00:27] from the Old Testament that are
[1:00:29] sometimes hard to
[1:00:33] understand now follow me if you think
[1:00:36] the new birth does away with all your
[1:00:38] marital problems I ask the simple
[1:00:41] question why do you need to Grace of
[1:00:43] marriage and
[1:00:45] divorce
[1:00:47] right that's
[1:00:49] sensable but you see I believe this
[1:00:52] message is to bring a bride
[1:00:55] to the
[1:00:57] place may not be but a handful right
[1:01:01] because most people are not going to
[1:01:02] understand it that's right but
[1:01:05] somebody's going to come to a place that
[1:01:07] there's going to be a bodily Redemption
[1:01:09] right right according to my Bible it
[1:01:12] hadn't been fulfilled yet according to
[1:01:13] me cuz I'm still here is that we're
[1:01:15] supposed to be changed in a moment a
[1:01:17] twinkle of an eye right that's right all
[1:01:19] right that hadn't taken place yet but
[1:01:23] see something's got to happen in what
[1:01:24] this message is for right sure brother
[1:01:27] brandham had to go back and preach over
[1:01:30] the Bible cuz he had to restore the
[1:01:33] faith of the fathers that's Miki 4 come
[1:01:37] on but then he says on spoken words
[1:01:40] original SE as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:01:42] fulfilled
[1:01:44] right am I right amen amen that was what
[1:01:47] the Lord put on his pin
[1:01:50] R I believe Malachi 4 is just what the
[1:01:53] prophet said he he said his message
[1:01:55] begun in the seals the other was what
[1:01:57] was already in the Bible to be
[1:02:01] understood they understood the new birth
[1:02:03] Paul understood serpent seed he
[1:02:05] understood those things he understood
[1:02:07] the predestination the great things but
[1:02:09] yet he did not have the understanding of
[1:02:11] the Antichrist because he never called
[1:02:13] it that he called it Grievous wolves
[1:02:16] John on the aisle of patmas came back
[1:02:17] the only one called it the Antichrist in
[1:02:20] the Little John's but how much
[1:02:22] understanding did he have of an
[1:02:23] antichrist because brother Brown said he
[1:02:25] was
[1:02:27] flatly flabbergasted about it when he
[1:02:30] saw that white righteous church
[1:02:35] right right see brother randam is one
[1:02:39] that come to bring us to message of the
[1:02:41] Redemption of the body right because
[1:02:43] that's got to be done right that's why
[1:02:46] you have to have the grace of marriage
[1:02:47] and divorce right not only for natural
[1:02:51] we got to have it for Spiritual
[1:02:53] amen remember your spiritual fornication
[1:02:55] is what causes your natural right that's
[1:02:58] right right now but there's some things
[1:03:02] that you have to deal
[1:03:05] with go ahead number uh six and let's
[1:03:09] see if Paul knew something about some of
[1:03:11] these
[1:03:15] things from Romans 7 2 and
[1:03:20] 3 for the woman which hath an husband is
[1:03:23] bound by the law to her husband as long
[1:03:27] as he
[1:03:29] liveth the Bible but if the husband be
[1:03:32] dead she's loose from the law of her
[1:03:37] husband amen that's right I me is that
[1:03:41] scriptural sensible she's bound to her
[1:03:43] husband as long as he live it there's no
[1:03:45] divorce for a woman right period I don't
[1:03:49] care what you want to argue about there
[1:03:51] is no divorce show it to
[1:03:53] me you can't do it a woman can't divorce
[1:03:55] her husband that's right right that's
[1:03:58] according to the
[1:04:00] scripture she's bound as long as he
[1:04:03] liveth all right but if the husband be
[1:04:07] dead then she's free to
[1:04:09] marry why cuz he's
[1:04:12] dead right it's ful sensible but this is
[1:04:15] what I like that most people don't never
[1:04:17] quote so then if while her husband
[1:04:19] liveth she be married to another
[1:04:22] man she she'll be called an
[1:04:25] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[1:04:27] she is free from that
[1:04:29] law so that she is no adulis though she
[1:04:33] be married to another
[1:04:39] man but we don't put all the Bible
[1:04:46] together well her husband die she go
[1:04:48] marry anybody she wants to Now where's
[1:04:51] that in the
[1:04:53] Bible
[1:04:55] well say right
[1:04:57] tired but if her husband be dead she's
[1:05:00] free from that law so that she's no
[1:05:02] adulterous though she'd be married to
[1:05:03] another yeah okay Corinthians answers it
[1:05:08] Corinthians 7:39 the wife is bound by
[1:05:11] the law as long as her husband liveth
[1:05:14] but if her husband be dead she is at
[1:05:16] Liberty to be married to whom she will
[1:05:20] listen only in the Lord amen now you got
[1:05:26] a different topic
[1:05:29] right she can't just marry anybody she
[1:05:31] wants
[1:05:33] to we'll get down to it he can't either
[1:05:36] that's what everybody thinks they think
[1:05:38] she can't but he can now I want the
[1:05:41] scripture where he
[1:05:42] can CU we're going to go through the
[1:05:44] scripture the only reason he
[1:05:48] can only in the
[1:05:50] Lord right you're not supposed to go out
[1:05:52] and marry unbelievers
[1:05:55] most all of us
[1:05:56] did most of us was unbelievers when we
[1:05:59] married unbelievers so I guess we just
[1:06:01] all wound up being
[1:06:02] unbelievers right but I still don't make
[1:06:05] it right and then I'd like a good
[1:06:08] definition of what un what Believers
[1:06:10] are because I I know churches in this
[1:06:13] message that you can't marry outside
[1:06:15] that building because if you do that'
[1:06:17] make you an
[1:06:18] unbeliever
[1:06:23] well you see what I mean you're not
[1:06:25] going to solve nothing with an argument
[1:06:27] of the
[1:06:30] brain you're only going to quote quote
[1:06:32] quote quote quote but what does the
[1:06:34] Bible say I just clenched the nail by
[1:06:37] the Apostle Paul amen the woman
[1:06:41] cannot marry
[1:06:44] again unless her husband be dead that's
[1:06:50] right see and I'm I'm sensible I know a
[1:06:53] brother one time that
[1:06:54] that U is you know his wife and and I'm
[1:06:58] sensible she put out with a law you know
[1:07:00] and tried to find her husband and you
[1:07:02] can go legally for so many years and you
[1:07:05] know I forgot seem like it's seven years
[1:07:07] you got to legally prove that you're
[1:07:08] dead or unknown of and then you can
[1:07:11] declare him dead I'm
[1:07:14] sensible you know I'm just not
[1:07:17] a but just make sure he's
[1:07:21] dead right
[1:07:24] you remember brother brandham on
[1:07:26] invisible Union don't hang him up in the
[1:07:31] closet
[1:07:33] right yeah
[1:07:35] okay but now think about it so let's
[1:07:38] prove the point with the prophet's
[1:07:40] message so we go to number seven and
[1:07:42] let's let the prophet answer this about
[1:07:45] the woman and her doings and this is off
[1:07:48] of the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:07:49] Christ paragraph 151 the pl the Bible
[1:07:51] plainly says here that her husband must
[1:07:55] be dead not just put away he's got to be
[1:07:59] dead all right we got the prophet's
[1:08:03] message we got the Bible the nails
[1:08:05] clenched right there is no divorcement
[1:08:08] for a
[1:08:10] woman I have always been
[1:08:12] sensible try to
[1:08:15] be you don't have to live with a man
[1:08:17] that beats
[1:08:19] you you don't have to live with a man
[1:08:21] that's dirty to you mean to you
[1:08:27] you don't have to I'll go with you to
[1:08:29] the court and we'll get him in
[1:08:33] jail but you can't
[1:08:39] remarry well what I'll do is then you
[1:08:42] know I'll just take my gun and I'll
[1:08:44] shoot him and he's dead so now I can
[1:08:49] marry no you're a murderer so what have
[1:08:53] you done
[1:08:55] right I try to make it comical where it
[1:08:57] won't be so dry at a
[1:08:59] point but think about it the Bible says
[1:09:03] it the prophet says
[1:09:07] it
[1:09:09] that there's no way that she can remarry
[1:09:13] only if her husband be
[1:09:15] dead all right we'll get into that later
[1:09:17] with the type of Christ in the church
[1:09:19] Etc coming down Through the Ages all
[1:09:21] right now but we know
[1:09:25] that according to the
[1:09:28] Bible and according to the
[1:09:32] prophet the man can put his wife away
[1:09:36] and marry
[1:09:44] again there's where we s up but is it
[1:09:49] true all
[1:09:51] right so let's go to where Jesus went to
[1:09:54] start with and just let him explain that
[1:09:58] then we'll read what the prophet said as
[1:10:00] we did on the other so let's go to
[1:10:03] Matthew go to number
[1:10:06] 7A Matthew
[1:10:08] 5:32 but I say unto
[1:10:11] you that whosoever shall put away his
[1:10:14] wife
[1:10:16] saving which means for any other reason
[1:10:19] the word except on the other one is the
[1:10:21] same form of word for any other reason
[1:10:26] see that whosoever shall put away his
[1:10:28] wife saving for the cause of
[1:10:31] fornication now if he puts her away for
[1:10:33] any other reason than
[1:10:34] fornication look what he
[1:10:37] does he causes her to commit adultery
[1:10:40] now I'll give you where the Prophet said
[1:10:42] if you want it he said cuz she will
[1:10:43] marry
[1:10:45] again that's his definition on that
[1:10:47] right in the scripture say because she
[1:10:49] will marry again she ain't going to
[1:10:51] remain
[1:10:52] single
[1:10:54] H and whosoever shall marry her that is
[1:10:57] divorced commits
[1:11:03] adultery then he goes to Matthew 19:9
[1:11:06] and he says I say unto you whosoever
[1:11:08] shall put away his wife except it be for
[1:11:10] fornication and shall marry another
[1:11:13] commits adultery and who so Marth her
[1:11:16] which is put away does commit adultery
[1:11:19] now watch what it
[1:11:21] says whosoever shall put away wife
[1:11:24] except it be for fornication and shall
[1:11:26] marry
[1:11:28] another if he does it for any other
[1:11:31] reason then
[1:11:37] fornication he commits adultery no no
[1:11:40] she no no no you didn't read
[1:11:43] it and shall marry another committ us
[1:11:48] adultery right Bible's plain straight
[1:11:52] honest all
[1:11:55] right but now think about
[1:12:00] it except it be for
[1:12:04] fornication I had some things moved over
[1:12:07] so we'll have to cover a little bit and
[1:12:10] then I'll back up this afternoon back on
[1:12:12] it okay uh I have it in my notes so if
[1:12:14] you want
[1:12:15] it now that's where people argue over
[1:12:18] the word fornication and
[1:12:20] adultery that's the argument in the
[1:12:22] people of the message
[1:12:25] the people of the message accept the
[1:12:27] fact that you can put your wife away for
[1:12:28] fornication some do and marry
[1:12:33] again but others say you know well this
[1:12:36] or that or the other but they cannot
[1:12:38] interrelate the word fornication and
[1:12:46] adultery all
[1:12:49] right you know fornication is
[1:12:52] technically we'll read what the prophet
[1:12:55] said what is done by an
[1:12:58] unmarried
[1:13:02] girl and brother brandham said invisible
[1:13:06] Union and if you've been married to that
[1:13:09] woman for 10 years and she confesses
[1:13:11] that she was untrue to you before you
[1:13:13] married you have a legal right to put
[1:13:14] her away and marry again that's on
[1:13:16] invisible
[1:13:18] Union because she married you under
[1:13:20] false
[1:13:21] pretense that's why I Bor girls make
[1:13:24] sure you get things straight I've always
[1:13:27] been one thing in a pastor I have no
[1:13:29] right I know what a lot of people do
[1:13:32] because they're
[1:13:33] nosy may you smile there people are nosy
[1:13:38] preachers are
[1:13:40] nosy tell me all about it I won't tell
[1:13:43] nobody else until I get behind the
[1:13:46] building and I put it on Facebook but
[1:13:49] nobody won't read
[1:13:51] it right
[1:13:54] nosy bunch of old
[1:13:56] preachers the only thing I know that I
[1:13:58] have a right to do is what brother
[1:14:00] brandham
[1:14:02] did I think it was his brother Howard
[1:14:07] brought a couple to him he didn't know
[1:14:09] him from
[1:14:11] nowhere
[1:14:13] and I mean this is Brother random he's
[1:14:15] one said
[1:14:17] it and said they want to get married he
[1:14:20] said well the only question I ask them
[1:14:21] is either one of them ever been married
[1:14:22] before
[1:14:25] he said well no he said well go I I I'll
[1:14:27] do the wedding all right you come to me
[1:14:31] and say well me and so and so talking
[1:14:32] about getting
[1:14:33] married that's okay either one of you
[1:14:36] been married before either one of you
[1:14:38] been
[1:14:41] engaged cuz if you're engaged you're
[1:14:43] married that's what the prophet says in
[1:14:45] the Bible too so said all
[1:14:48] right now but I'm not going to ask you
[1:14:51] personal matters
[1:14:54] that's not between me and you to know
[1:14:56] how many times you kissed a boy or how
[1:14:58] many times you
[1:15:01] know problems
[1:15:03] developed because I have no right to ask
[1:15:06] who is a
[1:15:07] virgin you may think that's way you
[1:15:10] could do it but you explain it you're
[1:15:12] just a nosy old
[1:15:15] Doty so I say have either one of you
[1:15:18] ever been married before either one of
[1:15:20] you ever been
[1:15:21] engaged they say no I said okay as far
[1:15:24] as I'm concerned I'll do the
[1:15:26] wedding but you two better go home and
[1:15:29] sit down and talk this thing over some
[1:15:33] of you of here you know what I told you
[1:15:36] you go sit down and you talk over your
[1:15:39] life before because you don't want it to
[1:15:42] be coming up
[1:15:43] later in your
[1:15:45] life straighten it all up now and then
[1:15:49] you won't have to worry about it that's
[1:15:52] just me okay that's Pastor all right
[1:15:55] let's see
[1:15:57] fornication let's see if I can find that
[1:16:00] one I don't want to read it where people
[1:16:03] won't misunderstand
[1:16:06] me it's on questions and
[1:16:10] answers I'll find
[1:16:16] it you can see I got a lot of notes lay
[1:16:18] out here
[1:16:20] so maybe it's in my office but on
[1:16:22] question question and answers I'll be
[1:16:24] glad to give it for you where that
[1:16:25] brother R says they asked him a question
[1:16:28] what is the difference
[1:16:30] between adultery and
[1:16:33] fornication he said technically
[1:16:35] fornication is a girl that you know
[1:16:39] before marriage but he said the word can
[1:16:42] be used either
[1:16:44] way all right now I'd like for you to
[1:16:47] get in the Bible and run a little
[1:16:48] reference sometimes of how that God
[1:16:51] would talk about isra is in fornication
[1:16:54] and then he would talk about Israel in
[1:17:00] adultery and I got where he said that
[1:17:02] Eve committed
[1:17:07] adultery two tapes on it we got to it
[1:17:12] now Adam and Eve didn't live together
[1:17:13] had live together so that would have
[1:17:16] been
[1:17:21] fornication come on
[1:17:23] am I right right they were in the garden
[1:17:26] together but they had live together so
[1:17:29] it would have been fornication for the
[1:17:31] Beast
[1:17:32] first why brother brother say she
[1:17:34] committed
[1:17:35] adultery hey I'm sensible fornication is
[1:17:41] technically before
[1:17:43] marriage adultery is technically after
[1:17:47] marriage what did he put the Lutheran
[1:17:49] away
[1:17:50] for for committing adultery
[1:17:56] right he put away the Methodist for
[1:17:59] committing adultery it's an
[1:18:01] interchangeable word but we don't like
[1:18:03] it like that we want our definitions to
[1:18:06] control the
[1:18:11] situation but I want to drop back and
[1:18:15] just take the
[1:18:16] point where we were dealing with that
[1:18:19] her husband must be
[1:18:20] dead and it would be saying are except
[1:18:23] for
[1:18:26] fornication and deal with this a little
[1:18:28] bit about the new birth and just let you
[1:18:30] see something if the new birth does away
[1:18:32] with
[1:18:33] our marital
[1:18:38] problems some of you may believe that
[1:18:40] that's right that's your
[1:18:42] business but see I want it in the
[1:18:44] message and I want it in the
[1:18:46] Bible to where you can explain
[1:18:49] it uh well the new birth this new birth
[1:18:52] just took care of everything thing well
[1:18:54] now then why if it took care of
[1:18:58] everything now here's the
[1:19:01] nail if it took care of everything why
[1:19:06] is it left that the woman can't marry
[1:19:12] again you don't know you just got nailed
[1:19:15] to the
[1:19:18] wall well I see the new birth this takes
[1:19:21] care of everything the new birth starts
[1:19:23] a process that's right that when that
[1:19:26] new birth is
[1:19:28] completed in a change of the
[1:19:31] body then you can talk about the New
[1:19:35] Birth all
[1:19:38] right why would it be that if the new
[1:19:42] birth takes care of everything why can't
[1:19:44] a woman
[1:19:51] preach
[1:19:54] right come
[1:19:57] on but yet we we don't let them preach
[1:20:00] right CU we don't believe it's
[1:20:02] right and we don't let them just go out
[1:20:04] and get married again just because they
[1:20:06] got a new birth we're not Catholic that
[1:20:09] takes the salt remember sprinkles it on
[1:20:11] them sends them back and makes them
[1:20:16] virgins big man in this message one time
[1:20:19] said they said he spoke the word and put
[1:20:22] the virginity back in this
[1:20:25] woman I thought now there's got to be a
[1:20:27] quote there somewhere the Lord where's
[1:20:29] it
[1:20:31] at so I've clicked it and there it was
[1:20:35] brother R said that's a Catholic
[1:20:36] Doctrine he said they sprinkled salt on
[1:20:38] them turn around them send them back
[1:20:40] make them
[1:20:41] virgins I ain't that dumb you may
[1:20:46] be but I ain't that
[1:20:48] dumb I don't think it works that
[1:20:51] way right
[1:20:54] but you get the point what I'm saying
[1:20:55] yes why would it
[1:20:58] State he can divorce
[1:21:01] her but she can't divorce
[1:21:05] him if you're going to hold it that your
[1:21:08] new birth takes care of it that's
[1:21:12] right oh you just trapped your own s
[1:21:16] see you can't do
[1:21:20] that cuz see it would allow her to
[1:21:23] preach let me get another one did the
[1:21:27] prophet say Adam and Eve in the marriage
[1:21:30] and divorce was
[1:21:32] co-equal is that right right if your new
[1:21:35] birth does away with all of it then you
[1:21:38] be back to
[1:21:41] co-equal we'll review this this evening
[1:21:44] you wouldn't have no double
[1:21:46] Covenant that says he can but she can't
[1:21:49] that's right
[1:21:51] right you see what I me
[1:21:53] amen well I don't change me I know it a
[1:21:57] going to change a thought in your mind
[1:21:59] because you already got yourself
[1:22:01] christianized and you're going to go run
[1:22:03] around all over the church and tell
[1:22:04] everybody else how that you don't agree
[1:22:06] with brother Dale about this would just
[1:22:08] remember the one telling it the one
[1:22:10] listening both guil
[1:22:12] kissm and you will answer to that
[1:22:15] because that's what's keeping this
[1:22:16] church from operating according to the
[1:22:18] way it's supposed to be and I will
[1:22:21] remind you that one day
[1:22:23] years ago we had a little
[1:22:26] problem I got to whole church together
[1:22:28] and we
[1:22:29] prayed and I said we're going to get to
[1:22:31] aen out of the
[1:22:34] camp and you know the Ain left the
[1:22:39] camp see I'm Pastor sorry folks I have
[1:22:43] to be different the rest of
[1:22:44] y'all you know com it's throwing stones
[1:22:48] I got to throw
[1:22:50] stones even though I don't like like it
[1:22:54] but let's just read what Jesus had to
[1:22:55] say and think about what he was just
[1:22:58] saying from Matthew
[1:23:00] 19 go back to that one
[1:23:04] brother go back to Matthew 19 where we
[1:23:07] started
[1:23:07] at uh get the whole
[1:23:11] 19 go back to Matthew 19 go back to
[1:23:14] verse one or two two or
[1:23:18] three God I wants you to read
[1:23:21] it I want you to read it for
[1:23:25] yourself the Pharisees came unto him
[1:23:28] tempting him they didn't want to know
[1:23:31] what he's talking about they didn't
[1:23:32] believe what he talking about they
[1:23:33] didn't give a hoot what he's talking
[1:23:35] about they were tempting him they
[1:23:38] thought they were smarter that's right
[1:23:41] right you don't tempt unless you think
[1:23:44] you're stronger or
[1:23:45] smarter
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:49] okay and saying unto him is it lawful
[1:23:53] for a man to put away his wife for every
[1:24:00] cause change that little word any
[1:24:02] cause any and ever would be the same
[1:24:06] right for any
[1:24:09] cause you know what he didn't argue with
[1:24:12] him I love that he didn't say you're a
[1:24:16] bunch of this and I can discern out your
[1:24:17] spirits tell you who you are and who you
[1:24:19] with last night I can do all these he
[1:24:21] didn't use none of his
[1:24:25] GI you don't think he couldn't have done
[1:24:27] it you don't think he could have put
[1:24:29] them everyone on the spot I can't
[1:24:32] believe he
[1:24:35] could he answered and said unto them
[1:24:38] have you not
[1:24:42] read that which he made at them at the
[1:24:45] beginning made them male and female two
[1:24:50] two not male and female
[1:24:54] males male and female two okay and he
[1:25:00] said for this cause shall a man leave
[1:25:02] father and mother and shall cleave to
[1:25:04] his wife and they twain shall be one
[1:25:09] flesh now watch what he's doing he's
[1:25:11] simply taking the scriptures that they
[1:25:13] are supposed to
[1:25:16] know and letting them explain
[1:25:21] it in said for this cause shall a man
[1:25:24] leave his father and mother wherefore
[1:25:25] they are no more
[1:25:30] Twain but one
[1:25:32] flesh you know they say after you live
[1:25:34] together so long you start looking
[1:25:39] alike maybe that's why brother dick
[1:25:41] grows a
[1:25:46] beard I can go into scientific fact with
[1:25:48] you on that if you'd like I do
[1:25:51] read
[1:25:53] you become
[1:25:55] one
[1:25:58] right so cleav to his wife and they
[1:26:00] twine shall be one flesh Adam and Eve
[1:26:02] was one flesh do you
[1:26:05] agree where did the Flesh of Eve come
[1:26:08] from out of Adam so it's one flesh so
[1:26:13] he's saying go back to the beginning
[1:26:16] they said can we put our wife away for
[1:26:18] every
[1:26:21] cause cuz you see they had got to where
[1:26:24] that's what they were doing that's
[1:26:28] right why would they be saying
[1:26:32] that they'd got to where they were just
[1:26:34] putting them away for
[1:26:37] anything CU poor woman didn't have no
[1:26:39] problem I mean she didn't have nothing
[1:26:40] back there what she should
[1:26:42] do you remember the guy that his wife
[1:26:45] got raped he took her and cut her up in
[1:26:47] 12 pieces and sent her all over the
[1:26:48] country wasn't that something how could
[1:26:50] she help being raped
[1:26:53] that's he cut her up sent her all over
[1:26:55] the country made him SAR to come and
[1:26:56] help
[1:26:57] him woman in the Old Testament just
[1:26:59] didn't mean nothing that's what it come
[1:27:01] down to
[1:27:03] be and that's kind of way it is now you
[1:27:05] know the byproduct you know the by
[1:27:10] product when I've asked you to get the
[1:27:12] definition of it you won't do it CU
[1:27:14] byproduct means of equal value are
[1:27:19] greater and you don't read
[1:27:26] sorry they're not tne no more to one
[1:27:29] flesh what God therefore hath joined
[1:27:32] together let no man put us under brother
[1:27:36] brandham said he better
[1:27:41] not no matter if it's judge who he is he
[1:27:44] said he better
[1:27:45] not they say unto
[1:27:48] him see they're not through they didn't
[1:27:51] understand what he's talking about
[1:27:53] right I mean he nailed their hide to the
[1:27:55] wall and they're standing there that's
[1:27:57] my saying come oh Georgia
[1:28:00] slang there was no way they had anything
[1:28:02] to argue
[1:28:05] with
[1:28:07] right they said unto him why did Moses
[1:28:10] then command to give a writing a
[1:28:11] divorcement and put her
[1:28:14] away first off number
[1:28:17] one I would like for you to find in the
[1:28:19] Old Testament where he gave a writing of
[1:28:21] divorcement the way they wanted it the
[1:28:23] way they say it the only one you got is
[1:28:26] Deuteronomy
[1:28:33] 24:1 who would have ever known that Mo
[1:28:36] that Paul gave a Grace over in
[1:28:37] Corinthians when he said I say unto you
[1:28:40] not the Lord we didn't know that to
[1:28:43] brother randam come along we didn't know
[1:28:44] Moses gave a
[1:28:47] Grace that's right look they said why
[1:28:50] did Moses command to give writing a
[1:28:52] divorcement he told us we could do it
[1:28:55] for any
[1:29:01] cause he said unto them Moses because of
[1:29:05] the hardness of your hearts suffered you
[1:29:08] to put away your
[1:29:09] wives but from the beginning it was not
[1:29:12] so
[1:29:14] amen and I say unto you whosoever shall
[1:29:17] put away his
[1:29:19] wife except it be for fornication
[1:29:23] and shall marry another committeth
[1:29:25] adultery he did it and whosoever Marth
[1:29:28] her which is put away does commit
[1:29:34] adultery but you know what that didn't
[1:29:36] straighten out their
[1:29:37] Doctrine they went right on doing what
[1:29:40] they wanted to do cuz that's the way we
[1:29:42] are we got it all figured out
[1:29:46] amen I I like what one brother told one
[1:29:49] time and he said it did he took a
[1:29:52] marriage and divorce book after you know
[1:29:53] he he wouldn't hear when brother Brown
[1:29:55] was alive but he took the marriage and
[1:29:57] divorce book and wrote on the book and
[1:29:58] said I'd like to ask him these
[1:30:01] questions you know wrote out his
[1:30:04] questions on the marriage divorce book
[1:30:06] he said one day the Lord spoke to him
[1:30:07] and said are you going to believe your
[1:30:10] ideas are you going to believe what my
[1:30:12] Prophet said you know I believe God
[1:30:14] spoke to
[1:30:15] him I to I said are you going to believe
[1:30:18] what your ideas or are you going to
[1:30:20] believe what the prophet said now where
[1:30:22] you going to
[1:30:23] stand right come
[1:30:27] on are you with
[1:30:32] me let me get one more scripture cuz I
[1:30:36] don't want to leave this dangling then
[1:30:37] we'll
[1:30:39] review go ahead with
[1:30:43] number number
[1:30:47] 7B no excuse me yeah
[1:30:50] 7B
[1:30:52] you can see by putting A's and B's in
[1:30:54] there I do a lot of
[1:30:55] rewriting I write sometimes a sermon 10
[1:30:58] times forever for preaching I thought
[1:31:00] that's what we supposed to do on
[1:31:01] football fields wouldn't he played all
[1:31:03] these things before you ever get on the
[1:31:04] field well that's what I do here I kind
[1:31:07] of play them at home and then when I get
[1:31:09] through playing I'm not worried about
[1:31:10] what I'm talking about here okay look
[1:31:14] what he says in Galatians about this
[1:31:16] situation of your uh New Birth taking
[1:31:20] care of everything
[1:31:22] I want to emphasize that because see I
[1:31:25] know that dangles on in people's
[1:31:29] mind we was riding down the road one day
[1:31:31] and my brother-in-law he'd been married
[1:31:32] twice I know three times but we was
[1:31:35] going down the road he said ain't nobody
[1:31:37] tell me I ain't free to marry I said
[1:31:39] Well good I'm not going to say
[1:31:41] nothing cuz that's what he said he said
[1:31:44] ain't nobody can tell
[1:31:45] me that's whatever do you can't tell me
[1:31:49] I ain't right God spoke to me
[1:31:55] I'd be
[1:31:56] careful saying God spoke to
[1:32:00] me I'd make sure God spoke to me
[1:32:04] before that I'd say
[1:32:06] it right you notice I'll say something
[1:32:10] spoke to me probably the
[1:32:13] devil CU he can line the word up
[1:32:16] too he just don't believe it look but
[1:32:19] after that faith has come we are no
[1:32:21] longer under a school master that was
[1:32:23] the Old Testament to thing for ye are
[1:32:25] the children of God by faith in Christ
[1:32:27] Jesus for it as many of you as have been
[1:32:31] baptized into Christ have put on
[1:32:34] Christ now watch him there is neither
[1:32:38] Jew nor
[1:32:41] Greek there is neither Bond nor
[1:32:44] free there is neither male nor female

[1:33:56] seven billion people in the world today
[1:33:58] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:00] and every one of them would have the
