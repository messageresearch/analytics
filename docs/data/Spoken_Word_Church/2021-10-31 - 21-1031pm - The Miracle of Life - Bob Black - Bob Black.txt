holy [Music] [Music] holy holy holy [Music] amen that's our desire this afternoon isn't it good to be in the house of the lord how many enjoyed that sermon this morning that was a that was a little masterpiece you know sometimes sometimes that it's a little bit of a struggle getting a sermon and getting the mind of the lord but sometimes he has to squeeze it out of us and and our masterpiece comes out i'm sure i sure got a blessing out of that this morning well this afternoon we want to talk to you um uh about uh joshua from joshua chapter 10 verses 12 to 15 and we'll just uh take a little topic the miracle of life and talk about miracles and talk about life let's just go to the lord in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this afternoon lord jesus we just ask the lord that you'll be with brother wade where he is preaching lord jesus be with us now lord god as we open up the doors of our hearts lord jesus and lord that you can just feel it liberty to move among us lord jesus i know lord this afternoon many i have many have needs lord we're we're needy people lord jesus we come to you looking lord jesus the author and the finisher of our faith lord god that maybe this afternoon you give us what we have need of lord jesus that we could we could see a little miracle in our life lord jesus because we know that you're still a miracle working god you're still a healer you're still a deliverer you're still a savior little god and we come with our expectations this afternoon lord jesus and laid him at your feet lord jesus knowing and confessing lord jesus that you're still able to to come and meet our knees lord jesus you're a need answering god lord we know that the answer to every need that we have is laying here in your word lord jesus and i pray god that you'll just let it rise from the pages lord jesus to meet every need that we have this afternoon in the name of the lord jesus christ amen it is a little bit hot up here i'm gonna go ahead and take this off joshua chapter 10 and it says then speak joshua to the lord and the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said on the side of israel son stand thou still upon gabayan or gabon i did look up the pronunciation and believe it or not it's gabon [Music] and thou moon in the valley of agilent and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man now think about that that the lord hearken under the voice of a man that a man would speak some words and nature would have to obey what that man spoke for the lord fought for israel and joshua returned in all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal you may be seated the lord has a blessing to the reading of the word so so that's maybe a an odd topic to take out of that scripture the miracle of life but i want to i want to uh maybe take it just kind of thought a thought for a few minutes on on what a miracle is and and you know how life is a miracle and you know we live in a time when when people don't believe in miracles anymore it seems like uh maybe maybe you sitting here this afternoon if kind of like brother aaron was preaching on this morning the devil begins to put thoughts in your mind and you begin to kind of lose lose sight of the fact that god is still a miracle working god and and there's more to the message than just learning things that we but we believe in a miracle working god we believe in a god that can affect change in our lives we believe in a god that can change your family that can change your home we believe in a god that can come on the scene and heal you and take whatever problem you've got whether it's problems with your hip or problems with your feet or problems with your head or wherever wherever your problems are and your body that god can touch touch those problems and meet that need because he's still a miracle working god and how do we know he's a miracle working god because he's still the same and we we know that's one of the most profound scriptures that he's the same yesterday today and forever because we know that if he if he the way that he acted when brother branham was here the way that he acted when jesus was here the way he acted when joshua stood and spoke to the moon and the sun we know that he's still the same today that he was back to you yeah excuse me i feel like i tapped into something now now brother branham when he preached the sermon the paradox and and he began to talk about how he kind of started off that sermon with he talked about how there was his brother that he kept coming for interviews with him and he kept he he wanted to be delivered of cigarettes now you think about that now he was coming to church and he had a problem with smoking cigarettes but they knew god was a miracle working god but yet within himself he just could not get rid of the cigarettes and brother branham said that he had like i think brother brown said he had like 50 interviews or you know he kept coming to brother branham over and over or trying maybe it was trying to schedule an interview he tried over and over to get an interview and time after time he couldn't get an interview but he knew that if he could just get get to brother branham why why get to brother brown because brother branham had a way that he could talk listen i want to just lay this out to so many times we think that brother branham had something that we don't have access to today we still have access to that same god if we can believe today god is still a miracle working god despite the fact that brother branham is off the scene despite the fact that we don't have access to jesus in the flesh we still have a miracle working god even though he's still the same now now his problem was he just needed to believe and when he finally got that audience with brother branham and he got sat in there and i don't know what brother branham told him but he fought brother mum said after trying all the psychology he finally got his miracle what was his miracle his miracle was he had tried and tried and tried to lay down the cigarettes and finally the cigarette problem was gone you see what a miracle life is when when the life of christ takes hold and you it change it'll change you it'll take those cigarettes and take all the drugs and take the alcohol and take the bad attitude and take the take the horrible spirit and take the argumentative stuff and take it all away from you and change you that's what a miracle life is that's what a miracle the life of christ is and it's a miracle when your chains are broken when you're chained down by depression and and agony and you think nobody cares about you and then life comes on this life the life of christ has set you free that is a miracle and brother adam said it's appear it's a paradox when something incredible without a reasonable explanation happens it seems incredible but yet it's true and you know what a paradox is it's a statement that is seemingly contradictory or opposed to common sense and yet is perhaps true and it's a paradox to think that the life of christ can come into a person and make them lay their cigarettes down and never pick them up again make them lay their bad habits down to change somebody from some being a horrible backwards person to somebody that's a real christian coming to church wanting to serve god that's a paradox and you can't explain it by reason you can't explain it by scientific you can't explain it by by making a list of all the things that you know with your own knowledge but it's something that's past understanding past finding out when god comes on the scene with his life changes the situation that's what a paradox is brotherham said now according to webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true therefore a paradox then would be the same as a miracle a paradox is the same as a miracle a paradox is when something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true you see why christian you've got to have faith to believe in a miracle you can't you you're looking to the unseen you're looking past the things that your natural eye can see we believe in miracles i still believe in miracles and if you need a miracle this afternoon there's a way that you can get it there's a way that you can get whatever you have need of because we believe in a miracle-working god a god that can touch you with he's touched by the feeling of infirmities and this god can touch back he touches back by his word he speaks back and he can reach out and heal you whatever your need is whatever your problem is this afternoon he's he's still a miracle-working god he said now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth and you are you are a miracle see now look looking out on the audience here that i'm looking at a lot of miracles it's a miracle that you're even here because you didn't come here by your reason or by the your knowledge but you came here because the life of christ called you and tugged at you and moved you tugged at you like hiding rights when hattie wright spoke that word over her children and the spirit of the lord began to move on her kids and tugged and removed them you're you're here because something got a hold of you and put you in this pew you heard the word preached and the life of god came on the scene and moved over your life and caused that seed that you received to come up and moved moved you into this pew and that makes you a miracle you say well brother bob i don't know if god does miracles anymore but you're you're proof that he still works miracles you're proof sitting here that god still works miracles brother abraham said i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodist and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church listen how he puts this was some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism in the holy ghost that's a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle you think about that anybody can look at somebody that's been changed and know that they come out of drug addiction no they come out of their religious dogma know that they come out of their denominational system look at somebody like that and know that there's a miracle that took place in that person's life because god got a hold of them and changed them to be changed is a miracle if you've been changed this afternoon god has worked a miracle in your life that's a miracle being worked it's a miracle that the holy ghost can take a center and change them it's a miracle that god can do that a miracle because you you can't do it your own self you couldn't lay down your cigarettes and lay down your old life and make yourself change only god could do that it's only something that the holy spirit can do brother abraham he told this story about he was counseling this young young german man that he wanted to marry this little girl and he he treated her wrong somehow brother brother said there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden come up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he it just wasn't in him to do it you see as much as you try to do right if it's not in you to do it it won't work and you see this young man that brother brown was talking about using as an example here he wasn't equipped with what with the life with the life on the inside the miracle work in life the kind of miracle work in life that would change you see he wasn't changed yet and because he wasn't changed he couldn't go to that girl and apologize he couldn't go to her and make it right you see he wasn't a you see why brother branham laid so many times down why how important it is to be born again first before you're married before you're married because once you get married and you're not born again you won't be able to apologize you won't you'll be all stubborn you'll have all that pride and stuff and it'll just make everything miserable you've got to be born again before you enter into something like that he said therefore the boy was a christian he was a christian as far as a believer he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had no matter how much he thought he had yet the life was not there the life that would make him live the life of a christian that would that i'm talking about the life that would make somebody stop living in fornication or adultery that life that would make somebody stop drinking life that would make somebody stop crowds and i'm pretty i'm coming down to the home level tonight i'm preaching about do you have that kind of a life in you tonight do you that kind of a life that will make you straighten up no matter how much he thought he had it yet the life was lacking in him and he said the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly listen to the father is making all these excuses that's how so many times the parents will do the parents will jump in and say well yeah but my son was baptized yeah but my son goes to church yeah my child my child this and all that the parents if we'll get away if we get out of the way sometimes god can do can do something that's like i was saying this morning that's why i like camps because you know you can get these kids to go to camp and then mama and daddy ain't there to interfere the kids can make their own decision they're not going up the scene because mom and daddy forced them to do it they're not they're not going up to the altar because mom and dad pushed him up there but they're there to make their own decision mom and daddy are out of the way so they can do something many times mom and daddy gets in the way it just messes everything up and he said the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ excuse me in the name of jesus christ in water baptism in the pool you see sometimes sometimes you can't rely on what mama and daddy says you got to have your own experience you got to have your own experience he said i know my son has come to christ brother adam said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he is regenerated born again i did now listen to this i know this hurts i know a lot of people disagree with this but he said i advise that young man to never marry a woman to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in now you're going to have people get married but he said he going to make hell on earth for it's going to be hell on earth for somebody to get married if they're not born again because their life is not there the life that has changed him from an old carl or somebody carl a man that wants to look at every woman on the beach that walks by a car a woman that wants to not not serve her husband and not do what's right a carnality god the miracle-working life of the holy spirit will take all the carnality out of you that's what being a real christian is about he said then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he is trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god do you realize what's happening when you get born of the spirit of god when you're born of your natural birth you come into the world with your with your natural genes of your mama and daddy you come into the world with your natural genes and and you're going to act like this german boy did he had all that stubbornness and pride like like his german ancestors did he had all that stuff that came down from his parents but when you get the new birth god gives you a different set of genes he starts aligning your character with his genes he starts taking over your life he starts claiming your life by the word the more word you hear is like god's staking something on you and saying this is mine and this is mine and this is mine and this is mine until he totally takes you over he takes you over that's what he wants to do is swallow you up in himself swallow you up until you're a living tabernacle of jesus christ christ made manifest in your members you see he's taken you over by his genes another set of genes you see that's the problem with you know a lot of ministers have a problem with people looking at horoscopes for that reason we're going to look at horoscope a horoscope might be good for your flesh or whatever if if it work i don't even believe there's no good in horoscopes to be honest i don't believe they're no good but if they're if if there were any good maybe it might be good for your flesh but we don't care about the flesh as christians you want to find you want to find out about your mama your way the genes from where you came from go look back to the word the word is what tells you how to live it tells you how to do how to dress how to clothe how to walk how to line up with god what god wants you to do horoscopes my horoscopes don't do nothing for a christian what good would a horoscope do for a christian what good would a horoscope do for somebody that that's not born again trying to figure out who they should marry or when they should get married when they should do all this kind of stuff look into the word of god and find out find out what the word of god says about things listen i i know sometimes that's hard preaching but it's it's the truth it's the truth we got to get back to the word to find out what the word says so many times we lean upon our own natural self we lean upon what our own our own natural genes can do i want to know what the spirit of god can do in my life because i believe in miracles i believe in a miracle working god a miracle-working god that can come upon the scene and take a sinner and make a saying out of them take a sinner and make a preacher out of them take a sinner and make somebody that god can tabernacle himself in and walk and use so make somebody a deacon a song leader somebody that's a real upstanding citizen in the community brother said i've seen critics staying stand off and make fun and carry on of a holy ghost revival and after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the pulpit preaching the same thing that he once hated it's a paradox how that god can take the unbeliever and make a mirror a believer out of him and make a believer out of him that's a miracle friends that's a miracle he said something something happened to you something happened to you that changed your whole being something happened to you that changed you and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle why all because the word got a hold of your life now brother brown said i'll pray it's a paradox that the word holds everything together in hebrews 11 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear brother brown talked about how you could look out on the and if you could look out in the galaxy and go like 150 million light years and just go and go and go and then come back at 100 another 150 million years back we'd be going he said we'd be going from the earth 50 years and how can our little how can our little minds understand something like that our little ant brains i put pictures in my notes just to kind of jog my memory and i got a picture of a little ant brain here because that's that's our little ant brain is trying to understand things how can your uh ant brain understand how that how that god can change your life how does he do it how did we probe at it and try to figure it out but it's a paradox because you can't explain it by scientific understanding you can't explain it by your reasoning all you know is that something got a hold of you and changed you and one day you were like this and the next day you were like this or maybe the next year or however long it took but something changed you and you're a miracle he said he talked about they talking about looking out into the galaxies and everything he said they broke in to find out eternity they say that john glenn the astronaut that went around it never taken one second off of his life even the speed that he was traveling about 1700 miles so then see we broke into eternity we're an earthbound people that knows just inches and so forth when you break into that unknown you can't fathom that our minds are not comprehensive our little minds are not comprehensive enough to understand we we couldn't we couldn't fathom what it means to get into that but we know that it's true we know what's true we don't understand all the ins and outs of how it happened but we know it's true and that's what a paradox is he's so something something beyond our comprehension is what framed everything up something beyond what we can imagine is what's holding the world together the universe together something beyond what is it it's the miracle of life what life god's life eternal life life is holding everything up that life that's holding everything up is the same life that can come and change an individual he said einstein said there's only one sensible thing to say about the world by faith we understand that god framed the world together see and the world standing there at space it had to come from somewhere now this is what einstein really literally said he said every scientist becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men somewhere out there he said i don't understand it but there's something out there where everything came from this firm belief in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience represents my conception of god and einstein said behind all the discernible concatenations there remains something subtle and tangible and inexplicable veneration for this force is my religion to that extent i am in fact point of fact religious so einstein with all his scientific knowledge had i had to acknowledge there was something out there that was holding everything up that's something out there that's holding everything up that's that thing that got a hold of your life and changed you how it stands in space how everything stands in space but we find out here that joshua joshua was stopping the sun joshua stopped the sun with his word now that's a paradox he said it's a paradox but god did it anyhow what by a man not a god not some great angel coming down from heaven a man with faith in the mission that he was given to take that land the word of god was behind it i give you this land and everywhere the soles of your foot shall set upon that i give you it's yours now how did he do it how how did he unleash the power of life that miracle working power to stop the sun now brother branham lays he lays an outline out for us that we can follow i'm laughing because you know sometimes in the middle of the sermon everybody takes a nap and then they wake up later that's all right that's all right get you get your rest out no we were talking to a minister that one time and he said you know sometimes people fall asleep because you know they they have a hard time at home they have a hard time sleeping the night before and they get in church and there's a peace there there's a comfort that you can't find anywhere else maybe sometimes people need need that little place where you kind of get you get so i give grace a little bit but the achievement listen listen to how brother brown lays this out he said the achievement he was trying to do see he had he he was trying to do something his enemy now if you go back and read this bible story about how how this happened he uh there was a city named gabon that had ally themselves with israel because honestly they got a little bit scared and they said they saw israel destroying all these other cities and all these other places and they said okay we're gonna you know what we're gonna ally ourselves with israel don't please don't attack us then another king rose up and he's he came after gabon so here comes joshua he comes he's go goes to defend gabon and he comes on the scene and god begins to work up a mighty there you can read the story about how they were they were striking the enemy down and they were driving them out and god began to rain hailstones down on them health stones big enough to you know a lot of times we go out in the yard and we're worried about the in our insurance claim because it might dent our car a little bit but these hail stones were knocking people down and killing them and and and joshua began to look on the situation and he saw them running for their lives and but yet the sun was going down so he knew he knew that god had given them that land for an inheritance and and defeating those enemies was part of the promise that god had given him so he looked at that in other words he had he had a purpose in his mind it wasn't he wasn't just randomly speaking to the sun but there was a purpose he began to look with desperation the sun's going down and the moon's coming up and something's something's got to happen otherwise we're going to loot we're going to go into the next day where they're going to be able to hide at night they're going to be able to get away we got to kill these enemies he wasn't he wasn't willing to let one of the enemy go get away he wasn't let think about how that's how we should be without without all of our our cancer problems and our problems with our eyesight and things if god said it let's pursue it let's if you've got the if you've got the promise of god backing you up let's have the faith that joshua did if god said that you can have it like i was thinking his brother aaron was preaching this morning as he was talking about the children of israel going through the wilderness if god if god was able to heal them as they went through the wilderness to give them everything that they need whatever what about us god wants you to be healed in your body he doesn't want not one of us to be in the firm in our body he wants us to go into the rapture believing and change he wants us to be he wants you to be healed so you can serve him he wants you to he he don't want ministers with vocal cord problems so that you can't preach he wants you to be able to preach he wants you to be able to think he wants you to be able to serve him with every capacity in your being so when you come like that that's how joshua came he knew that god had laid the promise out there and it was god god wanted him to defeat the enemy and that's why he was able to speak because he knew what god wanted done with the word you see why it's so important to come to a place where you know what god wants done with the word i believe that bride is coming to a place where she knows how to get born again what the born-again experience is what the word does to you what what effect the word has what what that life in you that's been doing all this time what that is she knows what's taking place and she knows what god wants done with the word that's why joshua was able to speak he said the achievement he was trying to do see his enemy was routed and he knew if the sun ever set them kings would get together and they'd come back upon him with double forces and brother baum said whatever god did i don't know but the sun stood still the moon over agilent because a man a human being a human being was in the line of duty now now see the point is nobody maybe nobody can explain that but it happened it happened joshua probably didn't even know how it happened but he knew it happened because they fought and they fought another day while the sun was standing up now maybe you have some maybe you can find some quotes to explain how it happened but you might be missing the point it's not that you know how everything happened it's just that you believe god's word and trust in him and and believe that there's a miracle working god that can change things you see so he had he had what he had a reason he had a reason for doing that brother brown said of course you got to have a reason for it you can't have faith unless you've got some reason as i tried to say last night some people's faith is in their textbook some people's faith is in something else but depends on where your faith is me and brother curtis were walking through a christian bookstore the other day and and they got there's all kinds of books that you could look and say well i got faith in this book i got faith in this man that was a book on elijah i got faith in this man's interpretation of elijah i wouldn't i you know i got faith in brother branham's interpretation of elijah i got faith in what this bible says about elijah i got faith in this so having faith in a textbook is one thing but having the faith in the word of god here's your reason the reason is god promised god he said he promised that he would heal you he promised that he would save you so if you have a reason and is it his will and he said i want to believe god's word what he says is true then i've got to see whether it's his will or not his will and his will is his word like romans 12 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god be transformed by the renewing of your mind how by the word of god to prove his will to prove his will out what we have is will the bible says in psalm 33 the council of the lord his word standeth forever the council of the lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations we've got the counsel of the lord do you realize how perplexing that is to people you you want to find out the will of god and you and you go and you and you pray you might pray and and maybe the lord will send you uh something supernatural maybe he'll give you a dream but that dream might be of the devil maybe he'll give you maybe he'll let you see a light but it might might be false maybe it might be false you see you've got to take everything back to the word you've got to compare it because his word is his will and somebody say well i i believe the lord is leading me to do a certain thing but yet they're not coming to church and they're not they're not doing what the word says the word is his will that's why jesus said in matthew chapter 7 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven the will the will of the father is his word and if you're walking in the word you're walking in his will one of my favorite stories in the bible is in first kings chapter 13 where the prophet comes on the scene and he god tells him to go down and to prophesy his prophecy is that one day a little boy is going to born will be born named josiah and he's going to tear down all the altars of the lord and he said during his prophecy he's prophesied that the altar that he's prophesying over is going to be rent whether they're worshiping false gods and he makes his prophecy and you can go ring it read it in first first kings chapter 13 lots of different things happen and they get upset with him and go fight him and then on the way home god told him don't turn to the right hand or to the left hand you see he had the will of the lord god told him his word what to do he said don't you turn to the right hand or to the left hand but you just go home and out of the bushes comes another prophet and says i the lord told me the bible says he's told him a lie he said the lord told me to tell you to come to my house and he had maybe a see you can't look at supernatural vindications necessarily you got to take everything back to the word everything has got to go back to the word even if even if a prophet comes out what if a prophet were to tell you you don't need to go to church no more what if a prophet were to come out and say well well we don't believe in the five-fold ministry anymore what would you take would you take would you rip ephesians 4 out of your bible would you rip all the scriptures out of your bible that talks about the forsake not the assembling together of yourselves even as you see the day approaching would you take that by that part of your see say yeah you got to take everything back to the word even if a prophet comes out of the bushes and tells you something contrary you take everything back to the word it's all it all goes back to the word and so brother brown in the message perseverance he said you must first find the will of god before you can do the will of god you must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose and in the token he said now let me tell you by his word he cannot go contrary to that word he's already purchased your desire if it's according to his will and his will is to heal his will is to give you your desire so if you know what his will is his will is for you to be healed in your body even if you're maybe slumbering this afternoon and not not paying attention to the words that are being spoken but yet it's still the truth the truth his will is for you to be healed his will is debut for you to be filled with the holy ghost his will is for you to be for your for your nature to be changed to be like him then you if you have the right motive he said then if his will if his will i got to go check out my objective to it and my motive in doing it if i do it because i say well i'm going over the mountain here there's a mountain before me there's a million people on that side perishing i got a hundred million over here i'm preaching to well if i can't get over around or under the mountain or nothing and yet something in my heart keep telling me go over the mountain go to them now jesus said they shall move this mountain if god wants you to go to the other side of that mountain and your motive is right and your reason is right and everything's lining up you're going over that other side of that mountain so it's time to speak the word speak the word what are you talking about brother brother i'm talking about say by his stripes i am healed by his tribes i'm healed and speak it what are you speaking you're speaking what god already spoke you're saying what he's already said and you're when you speak it you're you're following your confession your body will follow your confession and to what you say speak it and watch the kawasaki come to pass say i believe that my body is going to be changed speak it and walk into it now the first thing i'll have to say brother i said now if your motive is money if i go over here this sign can only pay me so much and over there see my motive is not my right my objective is not right or what if i say what i don't care about money but if i go over there they're going to be they'll build me up a big monument a big old statue and i can look you know he said brother i'm the great missionary this then still my motive is not right if you're looking for popularity if you're looking for money or those kind of things but if your motive is to seek god's word fulfilled then speak it and go forward speak it he said but when i don't care when i don't care if they ever know who went over there to the other side of the mountain well i don't care about my popularity or my reputation when i don't care that all i know is he's just in my heart then i'll speak to that mountain and it will happen then i'll speak to that mountain and it'll happen it will happen it will happen why because that will unleash the life of christ it'll unleash the miracle working god god can move then when somebody that's filled up with christ speaks his word something will happen he said see your motive and your objective depends on who you are and what business he said that's where the church misses it so far they get worked up in an emotion and first thing you know in enthusiasm you don't stop to check it back here again check there stop to check it back here again check there for sure then it's thus saith the lord see whether it's right you see what god god's molding us into he's bringing up building us up precept by precept word by word into a place where we know what god wants done with the word we know whether god wants us to go to that mount the other side we know whether god wants us to be healed or not god wants you to be healed god wants you to be healed and he's still a miracle working god he said if you have the right reason the right listen the right reason the right objective and you know what his will is the mountain will move if you got the right reason and the right objective and you know what his will is and you've got his will the mountain will move joshua had a commission to go over and to take that land and god caused the great paradox because all of those things were met he had a reason he had an objective and it was god's will and he knew it now listen moses had a commission to bring those people out of egypt to that mountain there it was in the line of duty moses began to cry unto god when he said that saw the pillar of fire hanging up there and there come pharaoh's chariots and he cried and god said why are you crying to me i commissioned you to do it speak and go forward it was god's you remember well if you go back and read the sermon why christ speak or listen to it that whole sermon brother brown is building up to the play he's building all the background of moses all the things that happened in his life and finally he got to the culminating point aren't don't you know what i called you for and then moses is crying and he said don't cry to me just speak because he had a commission and a commission is an instruction a command or duty given to a person or group of people a formal written authorization to perform various acts and duties and we've got a formal written authorization to perform various acts and duties this is our authorization what kind of authorization we've got the authority that in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we've got god's written authority to speak his word to perform his word to believe his word to go and see the miracle working life of christ work miracles the trouble of it is today brother ram said the churches speak look like say well what did moody say well what did sankey say but the question is what did god say you could go into the christian bookstore and look at all the different commentaries on the wall of of a.w pink and e.w bullinger and they go on and on and clarence larkin and what did they say but what did god say that's why the message is so so such a blessing in this hour that god has he's downloaded the revelation the correct interpretation of the whole bible to us that when you get into the message just like you get a all of a sudden you get a bible phd you you get a supernatural understanding of everything from genesis to revelation because because we know what god said now we know now we know how to baptize we know how to how many whether there's one god or or three we know from the end from the beginning and brother brown said speak and say what god said amen let's go forward not go look you know that's what the commission to the church was speak and go forward don't ever go back christians don't go back we go forward because the same one that was with moses is with the ministry of today speaking the word over the people if you'll just speak the word the mountain will move if you'll speak at the mountain world speak what speak it his will is for you to be delivered his will is for you to be born again his will is for you to grow in grace and knowledge just like jesus did his will is for you to come into maturity his will is for your body to be healed i hope nobody leaves this afternoon wondering if god wants you to be healed that's his will is for your body to be healed his will is for you to have peace in your mind so if you're in trouble this afternoon troubled in your mind and can't sleep tossing and turning at night on your bed of pain his will is for you to be delivered of that so speak it and go forward i believe that that's your will for my life and walk into your confession speak it listen moses got to a place where he was there and the waters were all in front of him and god told him to speak and he spoke the word and the waters parted he spoke and the egyptians couldn't explain it with all their science with all their technology they couldn't understand how the waters parted they tried to ride in there and impersonate some things and ride through there and get to the other side and the waters closed in on them because it was a paradox they couldn't explain it but yet it happened something happened god moved that water aside because a man got a hold of god in the channel of god and spoke his word and you've got that same commission that moses had to speak the word and go forward you think about all those all those children of israel going through that water and then going through the wilderness two million people in the middle of a paradox and not realizing that god was working a miracle wandering wondering as they walked through the wilderness when god gave him water from a rock and god gave him food from heaven wondering if god still loved him and they were right in the middle of a paradox could you be in the middle of a paradox right now wondering what wondering if god still works miracles when god's opened the windows of heaven for you they wondered for if god still loved them they kept longing for their leaks and onions in egypt they were wondering if god really was with moses wondering if god really was with the ministry i wonder how many people today are wondering if god really is on the scene i wonder if that really is god speaking through the ministry wondering if they really could defeat the giants or not after all that god had done for him after all the miracles that they had seen going after golden calves and yet they were actually walking in a miracle they had a smitten rock that followed them they had the water coming from the rock all they had to do was walk out and gather food off the ground every morning maybe it took a little bit of time to gather up the man off the ground and pick it up but they were living in a miracle and they didn't realize it and the paradox says you are a miracle god is changing your life as you receive the word do you recognize that you're a miracle it was a paradox when joshua and caleb stood strong and believed that god was able two of them brother ben preached that sermon one in a million because there was two million out there and one in a million believed against all the odds they all came against them because while they began to look for scientific reasoning they began to look for something with their with their intellectual knowledge that they could grasp a hold to but a paradox is something that's beyond be past finding out beyond anything that you could understand with your own knowledge he said it was a paradox to see a handful of people unarmed almost but what they had picked up on the deserts and where they had chased other man probably with such as old rakes and sauce and whatever they could get a hold of when they finally came into the promised land a paradox to see a bunch of people like that with rakes and sauls come and take over the enemy and sweep through the land a paradox to see the walls of jericho fall to the ground it was a paradox when noah preached the word to a scientific age noah had a commission what was his commission that destruction is coming isn't that what malachi 4 it talks about that just before the great and dreadful day of the lord god will send a message and god sent a message back then that destruction is coming to get in the ark and what's our arc now to get into christ and noah preached to an intellectual world like we're preaching through now a day when they were farther advanced in science than we are now he said we could never build a pyramid they say they say they built that pyramid by by a bunch of people pushing it up a sledge or something brother brown talked about how that you could get a train car out on the train tracks and put grease all grease the wheels all up underneath and put a whole bunch of people behind that you won't be able to move that train car and it's got wheels in other words they had all kinds of scientific understanding they had way more scientific advancement than we do and they had all that scientific knowledge with all their instruments to look up into the heavens and say there ain't no rain where's the rain gonna come from but yet god said it what's the point brother bob we know all this kind of stuff we we've heard we've rehearsed all this in our mind before but the point is you can't reason out of body change in your mind how it's going to happen but yet god said you can't reason out in your mind how god's gonna heal that hip problem how god's gonna heal that back problem you can't reason it out in your mind but yet god's word said it and that's a paradox a paradox is when a miracle happens and you can't explain it how you gonna explain it when you go and you tell people at work i don't know what happened on the cat scan but something happened and it ain't the same as it was before i took the cat scan before i took the x-ray i don't know what happened all i know is i ain't the same all i know is god came in and took over noah only listen they had all that science but noah only had the word of the lord and the face of all that science noah only had the word of the lord noah had a revelation of what the will of god was to do noah had a revelation that he needed to build that ark and he went through three pulls just like we're going through three pools god told him to build that ark and he got started and then he labored and he labored and labored and then finally the day came when they went in there and god shut the door in a third pool they were in there and he was maybe it came time to look out there and all those that have rejected the message and the third pool were preaching to the lost they wanted to get in then but the door was shut noah only had the word of the lord in the face of all their science against all their instruments he knew it was going to rain he knew destruction was coming he knew the way of escape he knew he was going to build an ark he knew he knew what god wanted done with his word he knew he knew it was going to reign he knew the recipe to get out he knew to build an ark he knew how to build an ark the brothers were telling me that they went some of y'all went to the see that that art model that they built up north and you can walk around and look i haven't been but they tell me how amazing it is to see to think about a man that would know have the knowledge to build something that like that that god would architect something like that and give him a revelation of how to get out of here of how to go to another world another a world without sin a world that had been cleaned off a world that had been pursed and yet noah couldn't prove a thing noah couldn't prove that his message was right how would he prove it did noah have any did noah have a pillar of fire come down out of the cloud did noah have any kind of scientific proof he all he had was a message that god had given him a message that god proved one day to be right and you know what those people they had to either believe what he was saying was right or they didn't believe it they had two choices either believe what he said was right or not believe it and you've got that same choice today one day it'll be proven out but for now you've got to you've got to take it or leave it you've got to accept it by the preaching of the world whether or not this matches up by the bible or not noah said it's going to happen anyhow see and it rained that was a paradoxy something that could not be explained but god shook the earth around just in condition so it would rain so you see it was a paradox for noah to do that why did god do it that way god did it that way because he was going to do it again in the last days he's doing the same thing again noah preached to a scientific age of a bunch of unbelieving people people that didn't even eventually weren't even swayed by his message and the bible says in matthew 24 as it was in the days of noah so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as as in the days that were before the flood they were eaten and drinking and married and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark listen they were they were they were going through life until noah went into the ark there was not a lot of bad things happening they just they went into the art one day and it called everybody off guard and it'll catch people off guard today because the bible says that they were eating and drinking they were having their parties they were marrying and giving in marriage they're going about life building putting up skyscrapers tearing down skyscrapers building houses building new subdivisions going along doing the same thing and all of a sudden the son of man comes on the scene and people don't recognize it people are called away the bible says listen the bible says it's going to be a secret catching away two will be in the bed one will be caught one bit two will be in the field one will be gone one will be left two will be two be working two will be at the office two will be two be wherever and one will be gone because it'll be a secret but it was the same it's the same thing happening today that it happened with when noah and noah's day noah noah preaching to a lot of evil scientific people in the most the evils thing about all that understanding that they had and now we're in a day where we got the internet we got social media all these things it's happening all over again ezekiel said uh uh ecclesiastes there's nothing new under the sun god will do it again in the most evil scientific intellectual age god will send a message that cannot be proven by their intellect a paradox a paradox that cannot be proven by scientist this by scientific knowledge and his message is still the same to get in the ark brother and preached a message to get into the art because he knew that there was going to be somebody to get in you think about how hard it was for noah to get people on the ark he preached and he preached and he preached for 100 years and it was it was far easier to get the animals on the ark because the spirit of god could just move over those animals and here they come one day god noah would look out there and see all those animals coming two by two and seven by seven for the the clean animals and all they were coming and coming and coming i wonder if you wondered why are all why are all the animals coming but yet i preached and i've preached my heart out for a hundred years and only eight people are on this ark he wanted to see that ark field i wonder maybe if he built it so be because he wanted to get it full but yet nobody responded it's going to be so you listen you wait till the end of this message brother brown nails it down how few because he's looking he's looking for that life where is the life of christ where is the life as it was in the days of noah to think if they wanted to get on the ark they had to come by noah's message the only way the only way to get in that door was to believe what that man preached that was the only way to get in that art was to believe what that man preached and if they would just step into that ark they would step into another world it'd take a long time to get there but eventually one a year later the the door would open and they step out into a world with no no no sin and no uh i'm following my type now i know noah got drunk and that kind of stuff but no all that scientific stuff got got was destroyed the earth was cleaned off and and god was starting all brand new brother brown said we find that in the days of noah that while he preached they could hardly believe such a thing as that noah believing no one was believing for such a thing but finally the paradox came and it happened it actually rained the word came to pass then and it's still coming to pass today he said let me go with the word not with some educational program or something somebody has cooked up somewhere i know god's word will never fail the word you see is everything you need the word is everything you need you know in acts chapter 3 it says that peter was talking at the gate beautiful when he when he when when he spoke the words over that man that was that was lame and he spoke to him and he said and he began to preach as they they began to question out there after he rose to from his feet and he said he shall send jesus christ which was which before was preached unto you who the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things the times of restitution of all things and now now we're at at that time of restitution of all things the time of restoration of the word you see all the why the word is so important but the word is the word is everything that you need if if one word off that eve believed one word off back then and it caused them to lose everything what would the recitation restoration of the word the restitution of all things do it would restore back everything that eve lost it would restore everything back so now the word is the thing that's changing us it's a paradox now it was a paradox when israel stood on one side of the hill and goliath on the other side of the hill it was a paradox when david was anointed he was anointed and and he went to to defeat the goliath i'm trying to i'm i'm trying to kind of skim through some things it was a paradox to fight goliath with that little sling david david went against goliath with the most weakest weapon he got to show that if you come if you come with your your weakness and your frail is in your humility but yet trust in god trusting god with put put your faith in j-e-s-u-s like david did with his little sling that god will do the fighting for you because david knew that giants had been defeated there before he knew that joshua had come through that place before and he had defeated giants so he came with confidence believing that if god was able to defeat giants then that god was still able to do it we can come with that same faith believing that if god was able to defeat giants back in the days of paul it's been done before it's be if it was done in the days of irenaeus and martin luther then god is still the same yesterday today and forever if we'll just fall in behind the word it was a paradox but why why was they why was david able to slay that giant because the spirit of the lord was on him because he had been anointed with that anointing of all that samuel poured over him and the spirit of the lord was on him and that's the thing that does the work that's the thing that's what gave samson his power a little scrawny runt that was able to lift up the gates of the city why because the spirit of the lord was on him the spirit of the lord is that life it was apparent it's a paradox to see life and life is that paradox brother brown said it was a paradox when god caused the woman to conceive it was a paradox that how god the eternal that fills all time and eternity could come down and become one little baby crying in a manger a paradox that god would put his life in a little child crying in an angel ain't literally crying in a manger and it's a paradox now what are we talking about we're talking about life life is a paradox brother brahm actually said that in his sermon he says we're talking about life and he said the virgin birth seems almost easier to believe than the natural birth who determines what it's going to be and he talks about a germ trying to find his way to the egg and you think it would go from point a to point b the shortest distance but yet he said something unknown to science determines it determines which egg which sperm which germ is going to meet match up something that science can't explain why is it the one in the back and not the one in the front something moves it something unknown to science determines that that ain't a paradox what is point to point is the closest way around we understand but not that time god determines it you you think about how god actually brother brown said he bred this one to this one this one to this one because he's it's god bringing something into being god knew that one day you would be here and he's the one that did it his life his life is moved everything that's the paradox he said it was a paradox it was a paradox when he died at the cross why would that be a paradox because he was alive and yet he gave his life for you so that you could have his life it was a paradox when he died on the cross and it was a paradox when he gave that life on the day of pentecost the bible said that he and john acts 4 was ignorant and unlearned a paradox that he would give the holy ghost to a bunch of unlearned people that didn't know nothing about nothing they couldn't even write their own names that's a paradox you see so many people think that you've got to know you've got to know all the hebrew john wesley even said if if you don't know hebrew and greek then you shouldn't be preaching and people get that in their minds that if you don't know all sorts of intellectual things and you can't know god but if you can if you die to your own abilities and die to your own understanding then that life will spring up within you it doesn't matter how much you know within your own mind is how much you know of christ it was a paradox how then people up in that upper room there afraid of the jews and had walked with jesus but when the holy ghost came they wasn't afraid no more and what made the difference was the life the life is what made the difference the life is what made the difference with david with samson with joshua that's what made the difference and you you see when you got that life you can't separate the man from the life brother brown said now listen to this y'all brother and said in 1963 he said the real believer no matter what they are thoroughly satisfied they are thoroughly convinced because the life that's in them has already become christ it is christ it's no more you but christ that lives in you when you've got the new when you've got that life you can't separate that life from you anymore because now it's yours it's in you it's part of you and you can't tear it apart it's you christ is in you that's the mystery of god revealed christ in you the mystery is christ is living in you and it's something in you that can't be separated you are christ and christ is you you're both wound up together a masterpiece family just joined vulcanized so much together that you you can't tell one from the other that's why paul said in galatians 2 20 i'm crucified with christ christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me christ is your life and that's that thing that's changing you that's the paradox that's past all scientific understanding past finding out that christ is living in you colossians 1 27 this is my favorite scripture in the bible to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you christ in you the hope of glory so nothing if you've got that life nothing can separate you from that life paul said who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword can a sword separate you from that life once that life is given to you it's it's part of you you're the same nothing is going to separate you from that amen can death separate you from it nothing is going to separate it and he said we take life so commonly he said we pentecostals we're taking god too commonly the whole thing we just let it pass by what life that life is still present in the church he said that pillar of fire is still alive today among us after all these thousands of years and still it's here it's a paradox now you might not be able to see it this afternoon but the pillar of fire is still here how do i know because where the word is the life of god is present that's right the word the word is even how elijah knew when he told elisha he or he told his servant gehazi he told him that the chariot that there's more with us than within with them and he knew that because he was looking to the word he knew that the bible said the word said that the angels of god are encamped about those that fear him and he was looking to the word that's how we know that god is with us because his word says so amen brother braham said even the seed in the ground is a paradox and he talked about how that it comes up and he said there's nothing scientifically there and show us there but just let the sun rock around in its right position watch what happens it comes from somewhere that's a paradox what's the paradox of a seed that there's life in that seed and the life in that seed is a paradox so that's what we want to see we want to see the life in ezekiel 9 4 says the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the denominations for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof for all the abominations somebody in other words find me somebody that's got that kind of a life you know the brother of them said i want you ministers but if you go back and listen to that sermon the paradox that brother and priest in 1964 where he really laid it listen to how he laid it out so scald scalding he said he's looking for the life now he said i want you ministers to lay your hands upon that member of your church you pentecostal members in other words go find somebody he's given them a challenge go find somebody in your congregation that's got that kind of life he said then when you find this you come and i'll apologize to you he said you find that member of yours that can't rest day and night for crying for the abomination of sins done in the city 90 of them stay home and say we love susie instead he said oh you speak with tongues sure jump up and down and shout that's all right nothing against that nothing against your organization either but i'm trying to talk about life where's it at where's the real christian life where's somebody that really cares about what's preached over the pulpit somebody that really wants to be a christian somebody that's concerned about sin in the church somebody that when they see people living in fornication and adultery that ain't that should not be that's that's not right somebody that's concerned about the way that you dress and the way that you live he said now you showed me that member look how worldly he's talking about the churches look how worldly how indifferent always the outside expresses what's on the inside by their fruits they're known where is it at i just ask just answer your question before you condemn see just ask that question where is that life at where is the life of christ at that's what god wants to see that's what that's what the angel there and ezekiel looking for to seal to mark them in the forehead that sigh and cry for the abomination of the city the ones that have that life now you see you see why he's stressing this so much all the pentecost the denominations and things they said they had the truth many many people in the message like brother aaron was bringing out this morning many people in the message proclaim they have the truth and they say we've got the truth but where's the life at where's the life that when you go home and are you arguing with your family constantly is there peace in your home do your kids know that you have that same life are you a testimony to the people that you go out in your workplace with is that life on display because that's what the angel is looking for to go seal up that's what christ is looking for the life the life is what is changing you the life is what is bringing up that seed the life is what will bring you up again if you go down into the grave and the life is what will change your body the life brother ram said in the sermon he said oh god well let me read this quote first he said an expectation she said clergyman could you mark out on your hands 10 people a night in this city the sign and crying day and night for the wickedness and things that's done in the city does anybody in this audience know where you could put your fingers on five people that my what a challenge on five people that sigh and cry day and night for the sins and things of the city you see why brother brown put as a comparison as it was in the days of noah yeah asos were saved but he pointed to the rapture like enoch enoch was the type of the rapture one one and god he's saying he's saying can you look in your church and find five that are signing and crying for the abominations done in the city see we come to church and we've almost made it like a like a ritual we come to church and and and yet we go home and sin is still living effective in our life we we ignore the things that the brother branham said about how you ain't supposed to be living with somebody that you're married to you i i thought i thought we were supposed to be holding a standard like when ananias and sapphira came into the church that same kind of a standard where you ain't supposed to be doing things that the bible says are not right you're supposed to be manifesting the life you don't even have a right to take communion if you're not living that life that other people can look at and see the life of christ is living in me you come in church and sit and sit among the congregation of the people of god but yet the life is god wants to see the life on display he wants to see the light the life in you having an effect on your life and brother and said oh god but i look down through it and think what's the use of even trying that's a prophet of god looking out at the effect that is like like noah you think noah ever thought that preaching there at the door of the ark and preached and preached for a hundred years and nobody came but his family nobody came all the animals lined up all the animals came but nobody came but his family and brother said what's the use of even trying he said but then i looked down through there and see a little light here and there a consecrated christian praying is your life consecrated this afternoon are you consecrated that when you get along with you want to get along with god because you're signing and crying for the abomination done in the cd there's something in you that's crawling and crying out that you want to see god manifested in your life that it's worth it's worth more to you than just knowing about things but you want to know god you want christ in your life that you're willing to die out to all the things that you hold so dear that's why brother man said that seed's got to die for life to come forth the seed's got to die jesus what did he say the first thing he said except a corn of wheat falls into the ground dies it abides alone he showed them how to see him die to yourself die to your ethics your creeds and all this and when you die and the life comes in you can't hold that life down anymore amen when the resurrection power of jesus christ comes into the believer's heart you can't keep that down you might bury it in the ground but one morning it's coming up again you can't keep it down because the life will have an effect it will do something in your body brother brown i had that conversation with the enfielder there that at the apple tree my my wife and i it's it's actually down the road to where my wife's brother lives up there in kentucky and we went to the house and talked to the people that lived there now and stood at the stump of the apple tree that grew there where brother branham had this conversation talk about a little humble place in the middle of kentucky that you wouldn't now now it's going down in the history of message believers that little humble place where brother ram talked to the infidel and told him about the intelligence that makes that sap go down in the tree and come up in the spring that it's he said you could put a bucket up on the fence but why don't the bucket why don't the water go down in the ground if you put it in a bucket because and the man said oh no it don't have any life life is the thing that makes the difference and brother brandon said i said there you are now you got it life is the thing that matters life is what will make it come up he sees he said see is life i said see that's god god is the life the life god is that intelligence that's past all scientific understanding that makes the sap go down in the roots in the winter and makes it come up again in the spring and that man died that brother brown was talking to after he had received that life and brother bam came back a year later and his wife was bawling him out for coming up and and brother and started talking to her and he said i'm the one that led your husband your your husband to to the lord and and she said forgive me forgive me she said he died listen to how he died he died shouting both hands up in the air praising god knowing as that leaf come back as the leaf of that apple tree has that leaf come back he'd come back again see a paradox unexplainable the same life that caused that apple tree apple tree life to come back in the spring as the same life that gave him confidence at his death to know that one day he was coming back up again amen and brother brahm said there's many big paradox we could talk about but let's think of this he said there's one great one great paradox coming the rapture he said let's all be ready for that one how do you think we get ready for the rapture to make sure that that life is in you to double check that you're you're actually matching the word that what the bible says that that life matches what the bible the life in you matches what the bible says you should be a christian walking according to the word let's say let's not be like the children of israel walking through the wilderness wondering if we're living in a miracle wondering if god still loves us but recognize that god is working a miracle in your life even now he said you know you know what the life is it's the holy spirit as the music musicians come he said if you haven't received that holy spirit which is life that was in the first plant that raised up see christ first fruit of those that slept now if that life that was in him that spirit same spirit is not in you no matter how nice you try to be you can't come forth there's nothing there to raise you up but if that life is in you it's going to come forth it's a miracle when god brings life it's a miracle when god gave you the new birth and brought life into your soul it's a miracle the miracle is his life let's stand to our feet and just worship him if his life is here if his life is here moving through the building what do we got to worry about what do we got to be to be afraid of there's nothing can separate us from the love of god if his if his life if christ is in us there's nothing that can tear us apart from him not death not the sword not famine not plagues not heartache nothing can separate it from him because his life is in us his life is the thing that matters you love him this afternoon [Music] oh my god from glory to glory changing me changing me changing me his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world for he's changing changing me from earthly things to the heavens [Music] aren't you glad he got a hold of you glory to god get something in your life changing

changing changing me from earthly things to the heavenly his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world from glory to glory changing me changing me changing me his likeness

the world from glory to glory he's changing me changing me changing me his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world [Music] his likeness and image to perfect [Music] amen
