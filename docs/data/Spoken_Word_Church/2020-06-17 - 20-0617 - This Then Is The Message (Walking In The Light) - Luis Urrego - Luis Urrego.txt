father God in their journey Lord as they as the word goes forth bless us now meet every need amongst us father God and Lord direct us for the rest of this weekend we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's read first John chapter 1 Bible says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life and which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message and that's the title of the of the sermon I want to give this this morning this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us praise the Lord you may be seated this evening amen like I said I want to title this this then is the message amen and so and I guess for a subtitle is walking in the light amen we we we know Saints and we live in dark days very very dark days and in very strange days to say the least you know the more and more every day I wake up the more and more of a clown world I feel that we live in it's a clown world out there I mean it's just incredibly what what's going on out there and and and there seems no end to it it seems like but you know what for for the believer and for each and every one of us those things should be causing us to make us feel less and less comfortable in this life it should it should it should let us see and let us know hey this is not my world this is not my my this is not what I'm just a pilgrim here on earth just walking passing through amen and growing in the Lord and because there's something better out there see because we're groaning and travailing for something greater and something better that means that that is out there for us because if it wasn't out there for us we wouldn't be groaning for it you see you see we were grown for life we grown for none of us want to die we grown for life because there's life out there for us you see and so and so as dark as the world is getting amen and as and and and and we see just pitch darkness but look the Bible says that in the evening time there will be light amen in the evening time there is a people that is going to shine bright delight and and to think that is you and I and desire Saints there out in the middle of the people riding and and and all kinds of the things going on and taking place out in the cities there is a people that can turn on the light a man that can call upon the name of the Lord and those people out there and they don't need they don't need more politics they don't need more more more more things of the world to they need Jesus Christ and who is Jesus Christ in this ours you and I Saints Christ in in flesh who you who has the Holy Spirit in your life it's sad to see the people that the way they're walking and to think that that if this thing keeps going and that my children have to live in something like this for the next you know and I just say Lord just come quickly come quickly because this is not this is not what I desire amen so well let's talk about this light then amen and I want us to go to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 let's start from there from the beginning amen now several years ago I ministered a message called when God saw the light and maybe at another time we might touch that in more detail so we're just taking little bits and pieces from it but let's see where the Lord leads us so if the brothers could bring up Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says they're very familiar scripture to us in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth amen and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light period I mean it had to come because God said and therefore it needed to be manifested you see and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day now I want us to think Saints that and I want us to concentrate and just look at verse 3 here that God said let there be light and light is the vindication of us of the spoken word Saints when God said let there be light amen they had to come to pass the fact that the light appeared amen it was the proof that God spoke you see so that's the reason why now I don't want us to get confused with this light here in verse 3 is not the Sun and is not the moon and is not the stars at this point God was not creating the Sun Moon and stars if you read later down in the chapter you will see that God later creates that the great light of the day which is the Sun and then the great the the lesser light of the night which is the moon and then the stars so so but so let's ask the question then what is this light when God said let there be light what is this light amen because see it appeared and in this light it was the origin the origins of everything that is here on earth amen and you and I Saints were in that light but potentially we were in there amen so let's look more further what that light Amen so when God said let there be light and I want to try to just simplify this as much as I can so that even the younger one here can maybe understand when God said let there be light two things happen first and foremost the thought of God was expressed amen and what happened was that the logos came out of God now what is the logos the logos all the logos is is the Greek word for the word word in fruit and if when you read John chapter 1 where it says in the beginning was the word that means in the beginning was the logos amen and the logos was with God and the logos was God amen so that logos came for now it wasn't two people then no it wasn't two people it was the same God he made manifest for extension of God amen because he needed to have a body because the Bible says there when you read in Genesis chapter 1 it says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so in spirit form God was not going to be able to create the only way he could create was he take a body form amen so that's what stepped out of God when he said let there be light and Jesus Christ came on the scene the logos came on the scene is that simple enough amen because after that that's when God could create then because the next thing he was create was tangible things after that amen and he is just as tangible as you and I are Saints amen he's not some sort of spirit just floating around just just just oh you know some ghost of some sort though that's no he is just as human as you are but yet he is just as God as each one of us with the Holy Ghost amen and he wants us to look at him that way not just some ghost that's not my god I got is a human being and not just that amen he's a young human being as well amen he's not no old man sitting on the chair up there just kind of kind of like the way I see brother Bob you know when he does his beard to live every now and then not be back there or maybe Josh no he's not like that amen God is young amen and so if he's younger if he if we're expecting to be young again amen then are we gonna go to from young to see an old God an old no we're gonna see a young one he's got the Bible says we're gonna be just like him amen praise the Lord now I wouldn't even go in there but praise God anyways amen so when God said let there be light the first thing that burst forth was that logos now that logos is that light and that logos which is Jesus Christ is the life that logos is the word expressed or the word the word manifested because God said then the word manifested that was Jesus Christ amen praise God amen now again as I said because Jesus since Jesus's life the creation could not have continued that that light was not manifested first see the work that he's tangible amen there was not going to be any mountains no trees no no no living creatures or anything as such if God did not take on a form of body form amen right and in the form of Jesus Christ they meant the Bible says even if we read in John chapter one another very familiar scripture to us John chapter one the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God again in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God amen the same was in the beginning with God in other words he's always been there see to us we can't fathom that I says human beings we're so used to something's born and then dies something's born lives and dies some even little animals but to think that God's always been and that he had attributes within himself that he needed to manifest and you and I were part of those attributes see if he did not take that body former that logos didn't come out of God that if Jesus Christ didn't come out that way then you and me were wouldn't we wouldn't come come to be you see our bodies were laying here on the earth amen potentially they were so in order for those seeds that God had already planted amen in order for them to spring up amen the logos had to come forth they meant to shine that light over those seeds you see you don't want to seed when you plant a seed it's not going to come forth if you plant it somewhere out in the basement somewhere you see if you put seed in a basement in a dark basement in a dark place it is not gonna grow no matter how much you put water in it it needs also light and that's the same thing with each and every one of us Saints we the weird we also need the light of the word every single day in order for us to grow you can read you can you can you can water it and you can water but and that's just maybe just reading the word and just studying amen but you also need the present light of the word Amen in your life in other words coming to church amen and and being and being partaker of what's going on amen you need to be active in other words the son is active amen and you need to be an active part of the body see in order for you to grow amen all things verse three and fruit and John chapter one all things the Bible says were made by him see so so we're made by who by this logos or by Jesus Christ by this light or by this life amen by the word and without him was not anything made that was made so who created the heavens and the earth our Lord Jesus Christ amen and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now we're going to notice that when you read there in Genesis chapter one that when that light was manifested immediately God separated the light from the darkness see wherever there's light darkness can't understand it that's the reason why the Bible says that no man understands it's unnatural for a man us as human regular beans coming to this earth it's unnatural for us to understand the things of God because we are born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into this world speaking lies we come into this we're already in darkness amen and we're going to look at something here in just a moment but we come into this world already in darkness and that's the reason why we don't understand the word and we don't understand God we don't understand what these things are all about it's because you need the light of God to shine upon that amen if God's light amen Jesus Christ who is the word shines on on the word that you're receiving then it comes into manifestation then then it comes into into fruition you see other than that it's just you reading the word it's just you reading the letter see I could read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation every single day every single hour every single second but if God doesn't shed light on that word that I'm reading it's no good to him because God that word has to pop out from the pages of the Bible and needs to walk and step in flesh and do things and move and be you see what I'm saying it needs to move and it also needs to create atmospheres because wherever the Word of God is a man if it's in you it creates an atmosphere and it should be a positive they should be a positive atmosphere when Jesus Christ came on the scene here in Genesis 1 it was a positive atmospheres that came forth after that because he is the light and if that light is in you they manage to create a positive atmosphere around you amen god help us with that because we we that's the thing that's why we're scaling this up that this the Statue of a perfect man amen alright so Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God we can read there in Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the Angel of the Church of the Lord seein's write these things at the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God see that was Jesus Christ saying that their Bible says by him all things were created that are in heaven and there are in Earth in Colossians chapter 1 verse let's just start at verse 15 well let's just start at verse 12 given thanks unto the Father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins aren't you thankful for that oh my praise God that Amen there still forgiveness they're still mercy for you they're still grace in this hour that's only if you want if you don't want it it's not there for you see God cannot force you to do or believe his word amen he gives it to you he offers it to you but it's up to you to take it and say lord I believe that and I'll take that promise to my heart and and live and live it amen then God can do something that that's God then manifest in his light on the word that you're receiving you see who is that verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every Christian or very creature this is talking about Jesus Christ he's the firstborn of every creature see he was the first being that stepped out of the Father amen that's the reason why the Bible says he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature the Bible becomes a little bit more simple doesn't a man let's just ask God to reveal the word to us for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him amen and you know what Saints if they're for him then they're ours too if you have God in you amen if these things belong to him then they belong to you if that same light that same life is in you a man those things Thrones dominions powers everything visible and invisible is all belongs to you - the Bible says that the earth the Saints shall possess the earth amen this is our home one day heaven and earth will kiss together amen it'll just be glorious then and there will be no no autonomous cities or and there'll be no black and white race thing or nothing like that a meadow just he'll be one language the language of love and Christ is the king and his children will be reigning amen forevermore praise God sick and tired of all these things politics and all these things going on I'm ready to go home amen praise God and the Bible says in verse 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist in other words everything lives because he is the source of life amen he is the light you see everything lives biologically here on this earth because that big ball of fire is still sitting up there up in the sky you see because as long as it's up there there's gonna be life here on earth but as but if it goes away there's no life amen so as long as Christ is there and he's alive amen there's life amen praise God and he is to be manifested he's always wanted to manifest himself in flesh so even though we don't see him physically amen amen he's in his people right now see right now he's walking in human vessels in the Bride of Christ and you and I who have that life in us praise God amen look what the Prophet says here in the message there is a man here that can turn on the light God said let there be light now what if he just said it and no light come then we don't know whether it's true or not we don't know whether he is all right we don't know whether he is God or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't see so so then when God speaks and we see it is then that's the light that shines forth the truth of the word see there is light in life hey man so God is not a liar so when he said let there be light there was no lie in there it had to be it had to take place he had to come forth you see so that's the reason why he's the Bible says that he is the way the truth the truth and the life see because everything that comes forth from him amen every piece every one he said let there be a man it had to be praise God so when God said let there be light and light appeared you think about it Saints God light appeared when there was no light think about that I alway maybe it was just maybe in the image in the mind of God you see but something came out of nothing I'd rather believe that then believe something happened in some sort of explosion happened the galaxies away and they created the order that we are in now I just don't think that that can be every explosion that I've seen causes chaos every explosion that I've seen causes things to move everywhere and and and and it just causes destruction and chaos amen but this was no explosion amen the thing that happened as always was God spoke a man the eternal beam that was there amen he spoke it and it came to be I'd rather believe that and that same beam as in me and you what this evening praise God so something happened light came on the scene life came on the scene when there was no evidence of it you see same thing with the virgin birth see the the the the the prophets of the Old Testament spoke for me for years thousands of years and then Isaiah came on the scene and he said a virgin shall conceive sounded pretty strange it sounded kind of weird there's no such a thing that it's taking place but then one day it happened in virgin in the in the Mary came and came on the scene she had to come on the scene first right she had to come in and things had to be in a certain order and then that word that Isaiah spoke a man manifested in in them in the life of Marilyn and something happened when there was no evidence of it to happen but that was the manifestation of that spoken word when it actually happened that was that spoken word being manifest you see Amen that was that spoken word being manifested and I'll Mary could say was be it unto me according to thy word see that's how we get is the Bride of Christ could say be it unto me Lord I don't see the evidence of it I don't see the the physical things of it but but Lord be it unto me because you promised it in your word and your word cannot lie and when you said in the beginning let there be a man and there was I believe that the same thing can happen to me Amen that if I repent of my sins and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is the promise of God therefore I'm gonna believe it Lord therefore I'm gonna act upon it and you watch it manifest in your life I believe that amen praise God so Jesus Christ the light of the world came on the scene through that virgin birth a spoken word that was spoken amen right now I want us to look here at just a moment of a type of you and me here for just a moment and and let's let's look here at Genesis chapter 1 again because there in Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says there in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth now in the beginning amen you came on the scene as some sort at some point in time I came on the scene my physical body came on the scene in 1980 yes brother Wade said I'm a baby I'll be probably 40 years old next month now there's some that are older than me here some that are younger than me I won't reveal ages but I know brother Dale doesn't mind he he doesn't mind to reveal his age because it brings wisdom amen but I know some of you sisters don't like that so so I as the Bible says here in Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth in the beginning there was at some point in time you came on the scene amen there was one point in time you came and seen and verse 2 it says and the earth was without form and void amen now God had you on his mind before the foundation of the world the Bible says that amen and he had everything and then in his mind before the foundation of the world amen but and but he had predestinated some of us amen to be to be to be to come to where we are now amen I believe that with all of my heart and the Bible says there in verse 2 and the earth was without form and void I want you to notice that the earth was without form and void each and every one of us that have come here that are living right now at some point in time you were to form and you were you have no form and you had in you were void contrary to what a lot of people may say that you came here with some seed or something inside of your heart physical none of us were seeking God none of us were looking for God the Bible says the Bible says that all we like sheep have gone astray none of us and none of us we're looking for God when we came here to earth we were and the earth was without form and void see our bodies are connected to this earth we have a connection to this earth and so we came here just as the earth was I without without boy without form and void we were without form and void you were not seeking God you never in your life has sought God it was always God seeking you Bible says in Isaiah as all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us off on him on Jesus isaiah 64:6 tells us but we but we are all as unclean thing it doesn't doesn't say some of us were an unclean thing that says but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags so what does that mean in other words the good things that you've done here on this life since you were born those things are just like filthy rags before God's eyes they won't get you into heaven nothing good that you can do will get you in we'll get you favor for God from God there's no way because then it breaks what the Bible says here they're all of our righteousnesses are like filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away in psalm 51:5 says behold I was shapen in iniquity and then sin that my mother conceived me so we came here amen void in chaos out of order no order in our lives you see just like the earth came in that way amen that's how our life was whoever says that came here perfect and then it's spotless amen they are lying to you because the Bible says country amen so ok let's continue reading and darkness was upon the face of the deep man there was darkness in your life I don't think that when I was out there drinking and smoking and hanging out with girls and doing all these things that I used to do I don't think that that was that was light I don't think I don't think any rational person would think that those things are like no that's darkness and you you know what you were doing amen but that if it's under the blood praise God it's under the blood God doesn't remember it one bit so he's probably wondering why are you bringing it up right now it's all under the blood but just trying to help just trying to help you they're everything that we did amen it was darkness and was no life amen and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now that to me that that reminds me of for example as I was growing up many times I had the opportunity to come closer to God the spirit may be moving in our midst maybe maybe you were you grew up from up from a from a little baby you grew up in church and the Spirit of God moving as the words going forth the spirit of God's moving but if it's not doing anything in your life that means light hasn't struck there yet that means you haven't heard let there be light you see the spirit of God's always moving God's always given us chances each and every one of us to come to God amen and though in the word is being sown the word is constantly being sown the son of man is constantly sawn the word through the preaching through the things that you hear through a podcast or through something it's constantly being sown but if the light doesn't shine upon those seeds that you're lit that you're hearing it won't brings forth any life in your life that's the reason why you keep going the way you're going and it's a cycle of rebellion and a cycle of hate and a cycle of of my own thing and then this is what I want to do it means because light hasn't struck on that life at amen but when God says let there be light light has to come to appear amen when God says let there be light life has to spring up in your life and what does that mean amen maybe when you were in a service and all of a sudden the preacher says something and something sparks in your life and that revelation comes into your life and you say that's exactly what I've been trying to look for all this mall is my life that life Christ comes into manifestation then you see just as God said let there be light the logos came out the life came out Jesus Christ came out that word came into manifestation a man would that's when God a man could start working on you then but until then it's just the Spirit of God moving upon the waters and you see in the Bible says that waters represents peoples you see so the Spirit of God is moving upon the people amen that's what some people maybe they might jump and shout and scream and that to just beyond the flesh I could just be in the spirit realm you see but that doesn't necessarily mean there's a change in their life because when God is manifested on the scene when God is revealed when Jesus Christ is revealed amen a change of life takes place do you see what I'm saying I hope that you're understanding what I'm trying to say you see because after Christ who came on the scene the locals came on the scene then that's when things started to become more clearly then then God said let there be let there be let there be amen and that's when God starts saying let there be let there be let there be let there be let there be let there be until everything starts coming into fruition in your life praise God amen amen praise God so and brother Branham says in Christ mystery of God revealed what is then you birthed then you say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see as Genesis as Genesis 3 I mean as Genesis 1:3 when God said let there be light that was a revelation of Jesus Christ then do you see and so what is the what is light in your life true light in your life is when Christ is revealed through your life see this word when you read it and you say Lord it's revealed to me now it's gonna make you act upon what you read if you were lying if you were cheating if you were if you were listening to hip-hop music if you were if you're listening rock-and-roll music if you were engaged in drugs it doesn't matter what it is Amen it's gonna cause you to put some things down it's gonna cause some action in your life amen because it's Jesus Christ revealed in your life amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so the Bible says here in rep and 2nd Peter 3:9 that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but he's long-suffering towards word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance see God's given he's given everybody a chance see the Bible says that he's died he died for many he died for the whole world but he the Bible says he died for many because he knew who was going to accept him amen praise God Hebrews 1:2 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's a man praise God so Jesus Christ is that life that light which comes by the spoken word to the believer by faith see each one of these words that was that was written amen they were spoken word amen when the word is going forth as a minister's preaching that's a spoken word if it's the Word of God if he's preaching the Word of God all right and so you can grab onto that word by faith and receive the benefits of it or you don't or not or you could just disbelieve it amen that's the reason why in Hebrews 1 or 11:1 says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so where are we born again we are born again at faith amen it's something that you don't smell see taste or feel as a matter of fact as I mentioned last sermon we can't hardly explain what happened to us in the new birth we just know that it happened because the effects of it started taking place in our life when you we used to cut up and when we used to smoke weed and when we used to drink alcohol and when we used to be running around with women and doing all kinds of things all those things started to be laying aside Lord I don't I don't I don't desire those things anymore Lord there's something you know I'll just say this you know as own ups but but when I was younger when I was younger and I started I heard this message my mom and dad didn't tell me that's quit certain doing certain things and stuff like that you know it was just it was the Lord just dealing with me and certainly see we all came into the message at the same time I didn't grow up in the message you see we all came in at the same time but God was dealing with me I guess more in a in in a in a in a faster way than he was at the time - my mom my dad and my sisters because I was really soaking up this word amen and I was I've always been that way as a little as young you know just looking into the word and then when I found that when the message came into my life I was just soaking it up but you know and I used to all go around you know with with shorts on and then and things like that you know that's not just like a regular guy out there you know saying is sagging my pants sagging my shorts out in the basketball goal courts and stuff like that you know how they do you know but then one time when I heard brother Brennan said you know you sissies winning no shorts and all those types of things my mom is my mama doesn't say not one thing to me I just heard that word and I said you know what I don't want to wear that anymore and from there that's when it stopped see ya now that was just that was that was just me you see that was the word Amen so that is why you are born again at faith see that's when the light of God comes in or the Holy Ghost or Christ Himself comes into the believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen at faith so it's something that you can occur you cannot Stacy's smell feel it's something that just happened to you and you see the effects of it afterwards you see you'll see the effects of it but the by but you have to continue in that word Amen so when God shines light on his own word to you then you can see it and it's revealed to you you see as maybe the sermon is going forth then if God shines light on that then you'll be able to see it then other than that it might just go over your head but God a man is prepared God has his light there Amen all you have to do is just be available to it Amen just be available to it see when the light doesn't shine on the word then there is no life that comes in there see because like we said the the fact that the light appears is because it's the manifestation of that spoken word you see that's the reason why it manifests amen I can see some of you are just trying hard to stay awake praise the Lord keep it up alright let's read to hear something that brother Branham said here and we're we're gonna try to finish up soon bro Brown says here in the message there is a man that can turn on the light so life is only by the Word of God made manifest life comes only by the Word of God made manifest as long as it is just in the book like this it still can be questioned see as long as it's just here in the book it needs to be lived a man it just doesn't need to be stay in the book amen the same thing with the message it needs to be lived it needs to be it needs to be acted upon it needs to be seen by the word by the world out here that's dying in darkness that little light that you show forth amen that might be the only light that they might see there a whole lifetime amen it needs to be lived so as long as it is just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word you see that's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God and when the life strikes it it brings it light strikes it brings the word to life again Genesis 1:3 he meant when God said let there be light there was life amen every age has always been that oh how we appreciate these great things how that the word being vindicated is the light of the spoken word see now watch this and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live in other words Jesus Christ on the scene revealing his own word in order for that word to live amen here's what he spoke now let the light shine Amen let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season amen oh you see when it comes time and spiritual life eternal life can only come by God's spoken word of life why because he is life it's all Christ he is the life he is the light life was the sol in this time in him is light and in him is no darkness and He is God spoken light is that right God spoken word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it's forever God see amen so it's all the life in the light in the word in Jesus Christ it's all that's all in you Christ revealing himself through your life and every time that you read this word it should because it should be a new book to you every day it should be something it should be it should be a greater thing opening up to you because then if we're if we're coming to a point where I just seems like everything's the same everything we need to go back or see where we left the lie wherever we left the light a man that's where we need to go back to it and the light his the light is in the word amen so wherever you left that light that's where you need to go back to it now in verse 4 there in Genesis and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so every time that the light shines forth in your life and God is working in your life God is manifesting themselves through your life there has to be a separation you can't be the same person you can't be acting the same way and you can't think the same way there has to be a separation I could not continue going on with my friends and acquaintances that I had when I came to the Lord because that wasn't compatible with me anymore as a matter of fact most of them I never left them they left me and if that's not happening to you man then son then you just might you just might be in the same darkness and area all blind leading the blind yeah yeah yeah well when light shines amen just like that bug amen at night something's that something attracts them about that light you see and it gives near and closer and closer until they can't even leave it anymore then the next day you find them dead on the ground and that's I should be with you and me completely dead when you when you come to the light of God's Word amen you're gonna be dead in Christ amen completely dead to this world and it doesn't matter the owner of the house may come in my goodness that bug was a huge bug this big it was just sitting around that light just enjoying it so look at him now the world might say oh poor thing poor thing but and you're you're dead in Christ nothing bothers you anymore amen the world doesn't have anything no hold against you because you've seen the light you've gone to the light and you've experienced the warmth you've experienced it's raised you for instance spiritual healing that caused you to die amen we could put it forth that way so God calls for a total separation from darkness 2nd Corinthians 6:14 says be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers amen hmm for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness I didn't say it Jesus Christ said it that's what Christ said so if we're feeling good around unbelievers and you're supposed to say that you're a Christian and you're manifesting the word of light and you just feel good around them to do everything and take a social drink with them and do everything within the darkness is overtaking you you're not overtaking the light's not overtaking the dart your darkness overtaking you here comes that that thing over the candle to put that light out see you're not being a witness you're not being a witness John 1:5 says and the light shine if and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there's got to be a separation that's the reason why the the other day when we're talking to the young people somebody is somebody there was a question about it's can we listen to Christian rap now I grew up with hip-hop music I grew up with rap I used to listen to what ankling and all these others - all those groups and all that stuff ok maybe some of y'all don't know what that is and you don't don't worry about it David nothing good there but I asked him and I said all right well what about if we go out here and commit a Christian murder what about if we go out here and commit a Christian lie or say a Christian lie is there such thing as a Christian lie or listen let's go let's go and let's commit on a Christian adultery there's no such a teen just because you put the word Christian over the thing doesn't make it Christian it's still the same spirit it's still the same the same beat it's still the same dance moves it's still the same thing just because they said Jesus for a few times does not make it part of the word part of the light it makes it word Li and when you were and when you're listening to it out there in the street whether you're with you with your windows down and you're it makes the same beat as it does if you were listening to Christian too to the regular hip-hop and the person next to you would not even know the difference would not even know the difference so is it something good for a Christian to listen to Christian rap I say it isn't but you know what Jesus Christ has to reveal that to you personally you see because I can listen to anything I want to I can go out here and smoke cigarettes and buy and drink alcohol and I can go to the club I can do anything I want to the problem is is that I don't want to that's the problem because blight has struck light has shined light has been revealed in my life and I don't want to do those things see that's a total difference you you you can do whatever you want to you can but when Christ comes on the scene in your life for real and it's truly revealed you do not want to do those things again amen praise God there is a separation there is a separation that's why in from the beginning there was a separation from light from darkness and that separation has to keep moving on until we get out of here Saint Matt and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness Ephesians 5:11 says but rather reproved them in other words exposed them don't have any fellowship with him amen now we're gonna rub shoulders with the world we have to work with with people that don't don't profess to be Christians we work with people that that believe other things and things like that but I believe that you might be there to be that light for them that opportunity for them don't beat us know it no stick your nose up and say I'm a Christian and I believe crap because that's not the Spirit of Christ either that's not the Spirit of Christ either amen all right so with this we're gonna finish here let's just look go back to first John chapter 1 and I just want us to take this here verse by verse first John chapter 1 that which was from the beginning so what was from the beginning Jesus Christ was from the beginning amen you read that in John and you read that in Genesis that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes you see this is John speaking here this is John writing because John was one of the disciples that walked with Christ so he has a revelation that that Christ was the one from the beginning the creator of heavens and earth that's why he wrote in John the book of John in the beginning was the word amen that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon in our hands have handled of the word of life amen see they touched Jesus Christ they lived with him and they that the the physical body of Jesus Christ here on earth they were there with him Maya would have been marvelous to be in that way amen praise God but it's greater amen to have Christ in me that's a great hey then you know it's great that I could touch Jesus Christ you know I can hug him and and things like that Amen but a man to have him living in me and that life is just the same life that he lived a man that's a greater thing you see because when the spirit of a rapper is in you you're gonna act like a rapper or a spirit or a rockstar is gonna you gonna add like a rockstar but when the Spirit of Christ is in you you're gonna add like rice you're gonna live like Christ you're gonna think like Christ you see but that's that's a greater thing to have the Spirit of Christ in you for the life was manifested and we have seen it see and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father say he's going back to the beginning and was manifested unto us so it was manifested there with the Father now as it was manifested there to them in it on earth and now it's manifested to us through the eternal life you see that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ there's not two different people here the same person is with the father and when you're worshiping the the father you're worshiping Christ when you're worshiping Christ you're worshiping the Father I see and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this is the purpose why he wrote this so that you can be happy in Christ not sad this makes me happy this makes me look forward to the things knowing come what may Amen I got great things coming in store for me and then for the Bride of Christ let it happen look whatever happens they could have autonomous cities in every corner I don't care Amen I want to see God on the scene amen praise God this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all all right so we've established that where where if there's lighting you there should not be any darkness singer because if God was light there was no darkness in him that's the reason why things came into fruition things were manifested trees animals Birds mountains and all different things came forth because that was all part of the light light is the life amen if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth I don't think I have to explain that if you say that you love God and you're walking with him and you're walking in darkness amen then there's you're lying and you're not doing the truth and he is the truth now but if we walk in the light as he is in the light in other words if you're walking in the life as he is in the life or he is the life amen if you walking in the light of the word for your day because sometimes we can walk in the light of the word for another day and that's not going to help us right you see sometimes we the message that that was for for Luther or Wesley that can't help us now we still glean from that light but we need to be walking in the revealed Word of your day amen in the revealed word for your day because Jesus Christ is moving Christ his movement so that's what the Bible says if we walk in the light as he is moving because he is the light as you're walking in here may meant the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin we have fellowship one with another amen we can't be living in the glare of another day amen it was great what happened in the 50s and it was great what happened in the 60s it was awesome and I wish I was there yeah sister Clara got to see those days her sister here got to see those days and some of you were there got to see great things taking place amen but amen those things are to bring us to where we are now because the light keeps unfolding you see light becomes greater and greater and greater and it wasn't just that light there it meant that was light but that light has become greater amen and it wants to manifest itself in this hour amen so you have to walk in the for your day and when you're walking into life for your day the Bible says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another see we in other words we have something in common with each other and we have something in common with Christ we have fellowship one with another with him and whether with each other and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin amen if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us amen I mean there was a quote here I was want to read here real quick Bible says he oh brother and says here then if we are walking in the god-given light of the hour then God takes that word that's given for the hour and vindicates it amen praise God see just like he did in Genesis 1:3 he said let there be light and light come forth see that was the vindication of that spoken word his word went forth and light followed it and cleared away the mist and the darkness went to one corner and the light shined on the other side and then that's what walking in the light is in other words that one when that light came to the manifestation there in Genesis 1:3 the mist had to roll away that's why there was that separation and if you're walking in the light as he is in the light amen things start coming off of your life amen as you're walking up the statue of a perfect man amen amen lust starts coming off your life amen and all kinds of things and you're gaining more virtue and you're getting more knowledge and temperance and things and things just start coming off of your life and the blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing you amen from all unrighteousness amen but that's it's walking in the light of the day praise God if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us and if but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us for our sins the problem is is that we don't confess right we want to hold things because we think that God won't here where it won't hear us we fail him and we do I'll be the first one to tell you how I fell him many times matter of fact many times even in one day I fell but I know that the light of the word says something different the light of the word says that if I confess my sins in other words if I confess my unbelief he is faithful and just to forgive me of my unbelief and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness amen and then when you go to God with that he'll just bring that into manifestation in your life he'll reveal that to you and that that'll say that that is like him saying let there be light and there was life there was there's the forgiveness I've already done it for you all you have to just say I'll just has to say is confess that's all you have to do amen if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so I don't I think that we we need to always recognize that we're frail and without him we're nothing amen without him we are nothing so so Saints that is the message this is the message amen amen just keep walking in the light a man as he is in the light and I believe that you're gonna be gaining more exposure of that light amen until one day a man will just meet him in the air meet the actual light up in the air amen and we'll be caught up with each and every one of those Saints they were resurrected a man will be caught up and meet him in the air amen and the Bible talks about that that there at the end in Revelation it talks about that in the city there was not going to be no need of the moon and the Sun or anything as such because he is gonna be the light amen praise God and we're gonna be right there him shining forth just as he is amen now that light is not got minutes its its life in other words there will be complete life no death whatsoever nobody dying no more sickness no more pain no more suffering no more people being being destroyed or being cheated or anything as such I'm looking forward to that sense I'm looking forward to that and if that light is in you that's what you would be desiring as well let the more and more of that light you take in the less and less of this world you would want and then I believe that's the desire of a true Christian amen praise the Lord Jesus so let's have the the musicians come let's stand to our feet amen praise God anybody has a need or anything in you or you say well you say brother Louisa I want it I just want to draw closer to God I want to draw closer to that light that lights calling me but for years I keep ignoring it for years I keep I keep you know brother Branham used an example of a man that's that that refuses to see the light a man that is being as the light is calling forth to him and and and and he just goes into the basement and he says I refused to go out I refuse that there is a Sun there's no such thing as a Sun and you know what he's gonna end up dying because he's never he's just gonna stay in there in that basement in that basement of fear in that basement of of sin and that basement of of whatever he's involved in and the sun's right there shining all he has to do is open the door and come out it's right there and the same thing with the word of God amen it's shining amen it's going forth amen Christ is on the scene amen and if you don't receive from Christ it's it's not his fault that's your own fault because he's already given us the medicine he's already given us the prescription now all we got to do is take it and I believe it will it will come to pass in your life exactly amen brother brother boy spiral notebook number 48 I bless your name [Music] [Applause] with leading Oh Lance and in there [Music] to say [Music] and they were [Music] hallelujah [Music]

good job man they're upping their game there man good job I thought this today we would pray over these prayer cloths and you sisters need to take where you're going put these over the door under the bed under the under the floor mat going underneath and put one in your car the same way with us man we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna put these prayer cloths we believe in them for those of you that are new we in acts 19 they took cloths off of Paul and evil spirits were driven away we've seen cancer we've seen man completely healed with cancer by just praying over a prayer cloth and giving it to him he putting it in his billfold he lived nine years late after from what team the doctor told him he was going to die in three months he lived for nine years so we believe that we've seen backaches we've seen people's lives changed by these things right here so we sure believe it's not the cloth it's the prayer behind the cloth but it is a contact brother John it's a contact between between us and who we're going to give it to so I thought to the tonight we would if we get them the church to come up and or at least the ministers and will pray over these prayer cloths the

least the minister's come up here and let's pray for the prayer cloths and and then we'll give some to the sisters and then we'll take some with us to the to the cabinet we're staying in but have a
