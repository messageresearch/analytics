anything else let us open our bible in the book of first kings chapter six let us read verse 7 it says in the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought cider so that there was neither hammer nor ox nor any toll of iron heard in the house while it was in building and another scripture in the book of acts chapter 7 verse 47 to 49 but solomon built him and house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as it says the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest be the lord blessing upon the reading of his word and you may be say that in the presence of the lord praise god god bless you all saints and first of all i would like to thank god for uh he made all things possible and uh actually i uh that's why most of the filipino ministers were not able to come this year to attend the competing because of uh in the philippines we are still uh wearing masks and uh before i uh and i think two months two months ago before i uh i purchased my one-way ticket and uh one of the requirements is uh we have to undergo a swap test before flying and uh and uh i didn't want to you know to uh waste money for buying a a ticket so i i tried to one night i tried to uh to use my uh uh my miles on the ireland that i airline that i've been uh flying uh from the philippine airlines and it did work hallelujah and uh a day before i flew from manila i was thinking uh that the swap this is still uh needed and when i went to the testing center the guidera told me to i asked him what what kind of testing do i need is it a anti-gen anti-gene or a pc pcr test and he said you look for your airline what they are requiring and when i go to the website of the philippine airlines it says that it's no longer required hallelujah and the next day i flew to uh los angeles and while i was uh falling in line uh before the before the immigration officer and he keeps on asking of course we are most of us are uh we are having tourist visa and he keeps on asking about the return ticket and i said oh my i do not have my return ticket and uh and i uh i started praying and when it was my turn uh he forgot to ask me about return ticket hallelujah so i thank god that uh hallelujah he he helped me hallelujah and i also thank uh our brothers uh brother wade uh samuel dale and all her brother uh terence and uh his family and all you all of you brothers and sisters hallelujah for uh giving me this opportunity to stand behind this pulpit and i hope you will bear with me with my poor english and just pray for me that the lord will help me too to deliver what is in my heart and me this will be a blessing to every one of us hallelujah and uh in behalf of my uh congregation in uh kalbayak city i bring greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah and i'm happy also uh here is uh sister chichi with us and uh you know it's when there is a filipino listening to my english and you know hallelujah and uh i hope you will understand as i'm not an educated person hallelujah i i just learned to speak english when i started uh listening to the message of the prophet hallelujah now uh tonight i would like to uh talk about the um the topic uh what house will you build me what house will you build me and uh solomon built him and house how big the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as says the prophet hallelujah heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest amen hallelujah now david one time he decided to build a house for the lord hallelujah for the lord to dwell and maybe one time he was sitting in his uh palace and looking down to the uh to the ark of the covenant to the ark of god that is uh uh built in uh with curtains in in in samuel chapter seven from verse one to five pieces and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies the king that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the arab god dwelleth within curtains that's right hallelujah he was maybe he was thinking that oh god is uh is pitiful hallelujah he was he is just uh dwelling in in curtains but uh me a human being i drill in this uh palace made with cedars and uh precious uh stones and uh materials and he said i will i will build a house for him to dwell hallelujah and nathan said to the king go the all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david that says the lord shalt thou build me and house for me to dwell in and verse 8 he says now therefore so shall thou say unto my servant david that says the lord of hosts i took thee from the ship code from following the ship to be a ruler over my people over israel and i was with the weather server the winters and have cut off all the enemies out of their sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth amen you know it is good thing to have a desire to do things for god hallelujah and it's a human nature abraham said it's a human nature hallelujah to to make plans uh for the work of the lord amen but we need to consult him first what his perfect will is hallelujah and david one time uh he thought of helping god hallelujah but god said david i don't need your help you are the one who who needs me hallelujah i am the one if you think that you became successful you be uh you were you are a great man ah a mighty man available david it was not you who have done it hallelujah i am the one who fought for you and you are and you are just my instrument hallelujah i am the one who made you great and it is not by your own ability hallelujah and uh and then uh god because of that desire because of uh what's in the heart of david if you read in uh isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 he says that says the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that you build me and where is the place of my rest okay david you have a desire to to build a house that i am going to dwell in imagine this david what kind of house are you going to build how big is it hallelujah heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool imagine if he's just if god is just sitting and he's uh sitting his throne is already in heaven and how much more if he will stand so what kind of a house are you going to build me amen hallelujah and what is the place of my rest hallelujah but yet god promised to david that he sinned alleluia the son of david he shall build him a house for his name hallelujah if you read in uh ii samuel chapter 7 verses 12 and 13 it says and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee we shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for my name remember they said he shall build a house for my name and i will establish his throne the throne of his kingdom forever but you know brothers and sisters if you will just notice these verses that god promised to david he said hallelujah that he shall build me and house alleluia for my name and i will establish his throne the throne of his kingdom forever but uh i believe this is not the natural seed of david which is which was solomon because uh when god promised something i believe that he will never fail or hallelujah his promise he will establish the throne of his kingdom forever and if we read the bible solomon's kingdom was divided hallelujah in uh uh first kings chapter 11 31 and 32 he says it says and he said to jeruba take thee ten pieces for thus says the lord the god of israel behold i will rent the kingdom out of the head of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee but he shall have neutral uh he shall have one tribe for my servant david sake and for jerusalem's sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel and if you read first kings chapter 12 that the kingdom was divided in judah and jeroboam herein the rest of the tribe of judah alleluia what house are you going to build unto me and where is the place of my rest so that's god's question amen hallelujah and as uh we read uh acts chapter 7 verse 47 and 49 to 49 but solomon built him a house how big the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands says the prophet so only now suleiman built him a house but god does not dwell in a house made with hands but the temple that solomon built hallelujah it only speaks or a types of the spiritual temple that god is going to build for himself amen because god will not do anything unless he had spoken it first to the prophets to the law or by our frusams hallelujah and he will not god is going to have a temple hallelujah but this is not speaking to the temple that the solomon had built but sulaiman solomon's temple is only a type of the thing that god of the true temple that god is going hallelujah to build hallelujah in isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 hallelujah ah it says that saith the lord heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that she built unto me and where is the place of my rest now god is asking a question aliyah what kind of house where is the house that you are going to build for me and where is the place of my rest and then he answered also that question for all those things hot mine had made and all these things had been said the lord but this man will i look even to him that is poor out of a country spirit and dream blessed at my word what is the house of my dwelling and what is the heart the place of my rest it is nothing hallelujah but amen alleluia that is poor hallelujah end up 100 spirit and tremble of my word that is the man that he is looking right here and uh the bible says a body has now prepared hallelujah not a building but a body hallelujah hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 therefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering the word is not but a body has now prepared me hallelujah and paul said knowing that that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which year of god and ye are not of your own amen hallelujah but when he came to the world brabham said when we came to the world alleluia this body paul said this is the temple of the holy ghost but the problem is when we came to the world brahm said we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies hallelujah in the ephesians church is uh abraham said now why did this have to be so why was it had uh why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way man was created for god man was to be the temple of god the place of god's rest was man the temple hallelujah so god was designed by god oh man was designed by god to be a place of his rest to be a temple of god hallelujah so braver acts chapter 7 from verse 46 who found favor before god and decided to find atabirnakel for the god of jacob but sulaimone built him and house howbeit the most high drilleth not in temples made with hands as says the prophet heaven is my throne and there's an earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest had not my hand made all these things he is stiffness and uncircumcised in heart and ears so we know that the circumcision of the heart is by the baptism of the holy ghost it's baptism of the lugos uh it is the spirit of god to dwell in you hallelujah and you were and he was he was pointing to the to the religious people of that of that day you were hallelujah is stiffneck and uncircumcised in the heart and ears you always resist the holy ghost you resist the holy ghost you don't allow the holy ghost as your father did so do ye then he continued he said continued satan has known this all along hallelujah satan knows that man was created by god to be his dwelling place and so and prophet said he also wants him to dwell man even as god so does he knows that god wants a body hallelujah a man to be his dwelling place and satan he also desired that hallelujah that's right but god has reserved to himself that right hallelujah but it is not for him that try to dwell in a man god he only desire he only uh reserved that right for him alone and not for satan hallelujah satan cannot do that god alone appeared in human flesh satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative powers the only way for satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine of gaddara then baby said god does not enter animals right it's only satan he entered into the serpent in in the garden in eden and he entered into the swines in gadara hallelujah but god does not enter animals even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at gadara but satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by it by abe as did god by mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled him he seduced her and by her and by her did satan have a child vicariously amen hallelujah he got a child which is kind can bore the full spiritual characteristics of satan and the animalistic sinful fleshly characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy s the holy spirit said uh that cain was of that wicked one he was so here is now although uh cain he slow his brother abel but uh god replaced him with with seth and uh said he got the uh his lineage and here is the lineage of said of satan true cain hallelujah through the serpent and that was a cane and he got his children and brahma said satan and the animalistic sinful fleshly characteristic of the serpent animalistic sinful fleshly characteristic of the serpent but the problem when it comes to genesis chapter 6 verse one and it came to pass when the ma when men began to multiply of the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and then they mingled hallelujah the the the seed of the serpent and the sons of god they mingle together and then in verse 3 and god said my spirit shall not always strive with man hallelujah through the first creation we inherited that the rebrand said we became animalistic we we have that characteristic hallelujah animalistic sinful fleshly characteristic of the serpent and because of that brevan said that god do not enter into animals alleluia only the evil spirit he entered into animal into the serpent into the swine of gadara and through our first birth brevard said that hallelujah and book of psalms david said in psalms 51 verse 5 behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me abraham said i was born in sin shape in iniquity come to this world speaking lies and paul said in romans chapter 3 verse 10 to 12 as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand it there is none that seeketh after god there is they are all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable we became all of us became unprofitable there is none that do with good although we think that we are righteous we are doing good yeah but the the bible says that our righteousness is like filthy rugs hallelujah and we are unprofitable we we were designed to be by god to be his willing place to be his temple but because obscene hallelujah we became unprofitable amen but praise the lord hallelujah down inside of us there is a there is a sin predestinated before the foundation of the world we are predestinated to be a part of his plan a part of that body his dwelling place alleluias ephesians 1 4-11 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us acceptable accepted in the beloved in home we have produced a redemption through his blood redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abundant toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself amen hallelujah he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh who worketh all things after the council of his own will hallelujah and praise the lord by the process of that new birth hallelujah by justification amen and by cleansing us sanctification and then filling us with the holy ghost hallelujah we became part of that body amen hallelujah and uh first corinthians 13 uh paul said that by one spirit amen which is the baptism of the holy spirit by one spirit are we all baptized into one body hallelujah whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be banned or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit by one spirit hallelujah of course before god baptizes us allelia with that one spirit we we went through justification and sanctification and then the last process is by the baptism of the holy ghost and then we become we became a part of that body amen hallelujah and whose body is that alleluia it is the body of jesus christ hallelujah we become a part of that body of jesus christ hallelujah which is uh the bible uh it says a new creation hallelujah that's why if uh when we were baptized into that body and become a part of that body we were in christ hallelujah second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature our the all things hallelujah are passed away behold all things are become new and uh revelation chapter 3 14 that jesus christ is the beginning of that creation amen although the first creation it was ruined it was marred by by satan hallelujah in the garden of eden the first creation and we became unprofitable but praise the lord hallelujah amen new creation that's why no wonder that when the first temple alleluia although it was glorious but because of you know even solomon himself he backslid hallelujah the temple and then it was ah rebuilt again hallelujah and uh in in haggai uh chapter two i think uh verse nine that the the second temple the the second house would be glorious than the other one hallelujah that's why brothers and sisters uh the first creation it was because of sin because of unbelief it was destroyed hallelujah but by the second creation this then the second or the new creation the new temple hallelujah will be most will be more glorious hallelujah so they are just uh types brothers and sisters and in the mirrors of the lamb 1962 he says all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church to continue the work of the gospel then we become not by artificial name but by a reality of the holy spirit of life connecting us into christ connecting us into christ then through the power of his resurrection we are raised from the dead things of the world and sitting with him in heavenly places amen i like that tonight we are sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus see resurrected with him died to the things of the world and took on christ and when we take on christ then the world is dead then no more care for the world the world is dead to us and it's dead to us and we are dead to it you are a different person different personality because you are a new creation not the same creation palestine not a man that sent a new leaf but a man that's died and been born again and became a new creation in christ jesus and the spirit of the living god lives in the person hallelujah so we became that temple not made with hands not a natural or material temple but hallelujah a body has now prepared god's provided place of worship 1965 paragraph 41 he says you are then not yourself you are a new creature for the greek there means a new creation you've been recreated again the power of god comes upon you and you become created a new creation creature which brings the whole physical being spiritual being and everything in subject to the word of god not no other way hallelujah so if we are in christ paul said that there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is a a bible uh i think uh in iv uh version it only says that there is there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus and period and they take this uh phrase who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit who walk not hallelujah after the place but those that are being baptized with the holy spirit hallelujah and then uh finally uh later on they found out that the the one who wrote that or who translated that bible was a homosexual hallelujah but uh to them that are in christ jesus there is no more condemnation those who are hallelujah who are walking after the spirit amen hallelujah and colossians chapter 1 verses 14 to 18 it says in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him we are all things con created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they betron or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of that body hallelujah not only a body uh you know an individual but that the temple hallelujah that dwelling place and said ah and the bible said that he got the fullness of the godhead bodily and we have it by measure but we are all hallelujah a dwelling place of that the same god hallelujah the same god that was in him that was in christ is the same god in the believers hallelujah he only only have it by measure and he got hallelujah the fullness and said if you get a big machine of a laboratory and then examine the chemicals on the ocean alleluia and then you get a portion of it in a cup and then examine it within a laboratory there is no difference the same chemicals the same quality that is in the ocean and the same quality that is in the cup it is the same quality the same hallelujah but we only have it by measure hallelujah we are all part of that body and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence alleluia he is the head of that body he is the head of that building the church the fullness of the godhead in him bodily hallelujah and uh in crisis the mystery of god revealed he says god expressed in jesus christ who was both father sand and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminences all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church the believers hallelujah we are a part of that body not a building made with hands hallelujah but the body of jesus christ and then brethren help me use the the the the this um uh this uh verse in matthew chapter 24 maybe the disciples were you know they were uh uh looking to that temple and one time they did this they said to jesus christ lord look at this temple hallelujah how how glorious it is how beautiful hallelujah matthew chapter 24 verse 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him that the building of the temple and jesus said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down okay yes it is beautiful it is glorious hallelujah but i tell you there is not one stone hallelujah upon another that shall not be thrown down and barbarian he went on and said it shows that god doesn't dwell in houses made with hands god dwells in human hearts for a body has thou prepared me the holy ghost don't dwell in a house it dwells in the heart amen that's the temple you know you you know not that you are the temple of the living god amen amen hallelujah but the natural temple that solomon had built is only a type of the building of the spiritual temple of the living god hallelujah the text that we read this evening in 1st kings chapter six verse seven it says and the house when it was in building was built abyston made ready before it was brought tighter so that there was neither hammer nor ox nor any toll of iron heard in the in the house while it was in building amen hallelujah and uh in the music uh a greater than solomon is here now the days of solomon as any theologian scriptural man knows that that was the golden age of the hebrew right they had no wars the the it was almost like a millennium to them great day they build the temple all nations fear them they was fair to do anything because they know that the people was with one heart and one accord god gave them a gift and they believe it they accepted it and with one heart and one accord they work with it like a millennium because the people they got one heart because they believe hallelujah the word the wisdom of solomon allelia and the people other kingdoms differ to make war against israel because uh the people they have one heart and one accord hallelujah and i remember when the queen of sheba he heard the glory oh he heard the wisdom of solomon and when she got before solomon and the bible uh it it means shown about how glorious is the temple and when he he and when she she was a watching how glorious it is and the bible did not mention how you know but the bible mentioned about how the winter how about the dimension about the people we're in order we have uh love one another and the singers and the main singers alleluia and uh you know they have one heart hallelujah and by abraham he got a message greater than solomon is here hallelujah the the wisdom that was in solomon it was not his wisdom but it was god in solomon that can discern alleluia and we had it in these last days hallelujah and i hope that those who believe that wisdom must have the same heart amen must have the same hallelujah the same the same relationship the same order not the fighting against one another hallelujah because we have the same the same god who was with solomon yeah and we are if solomo solomon built that the temple natural temple how much more that we need to do it hallelujah being a part of that spiritual temple amen hallelujah israel and the church he says listen when they built the temple of solomon the any of your medicines here now could get this pretty good they brought the cedars down from lebanon uh they floated them in as far as jupiter and hauled them by ox cart and so forth you know then they cut out all their stones all around the world but when they come together they were such perfect masonry and in 40 years in the building of the temple there wasn't a bus abba saw or a sound of a hammer every stone went one was cut this away one cut that way one was cut back this away but every one of them went together they started lying dusting putting the building up getting along fine and they found a funny looking stone they didn't want that they didn't want that thing said that don't belong here and they kick it out throw it over in the weed pile and some and come to find out they built one or built on and on and on and come to find out the very stone he had rejected was the cheap cornerstone hallelujah some where it came from maybe from the united states some came from africa and some came from the philippines somebody is shipping there somebody shipping here hallelujah but when they put them together hallelujah barbara said what a perfect masonry hallelujah that's why brothers and sisters sometimes i i i want i am wondering when i go to some places i feel the same kind of life i feel the same kind of spirit hallelujah although they have a different pastor and a different preacher there and different preacher here aliyah but there's only one hallelujah who is designing this uh this temple hallelujah and maybe bravrham said and they found a funny looking stone oh i don't like uh you know imagine i don't like to you know to to stay beside you but you can do nothing you are not the one who designed the temple the body you have to love your you know maybe different colors and when the building was finished oh it is not all white abraham said that god is a god of variety if you have a garden and you have all this uh your flowers are all white it don't looks good hallelujah but if you have a garden and you have this party red and yellow and white and pink hallelujah you got a very beautiful garden hallelujah so every part of the building is very important yes sir hallelujah it might looks funny to you but the greek art the great architect was the one who designed him that way hallelujah and you have and you learn to love him hallelujah and you learn to like him ephesians 21 in home all the building fitly framed together grow it unto unholy temple in the lord alleluia vision support 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the in effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase up the body unto the defying of itself in love hallelujah remember brothers and sisters that solomon did not dedicate the temple until it was finished until all the parts were put together hallelujah you will not be raptured without me and i will not be raptured without you hallelujah until the last predestinated said alleluia will be put into that body of jesus christ hallelujah so sometimes you know sometimes there are people that uh uh he wants uh you know it was god who designed you that way maybe you don't like your position but as long as you are doing your part in the body of jesus christ god will bless you and say oh i i i want to be to be a preacher because he is always you know he is always on display i want to be a musician or i want to be a singer and i'm only a listener i'm only sitting at the back of the church brothers and sisters if everybody will be here and nobody and even paul said that even the weakest uh you know the small parts of that body is more already just like uh this watch hallelujah maybe if i will ask you which part of this uh this watch you want to be maybe some of you will say oh i want to be the long hand because it's always uh the owner is always looking at me hallelujah i want to be the the some of the us above your watches they have a diamonds i want to be a diamond i want to be the the second hand but brothers and sisters don't you know that the the most important part of this watch are those parts that are inside in this watch those very small parts that even our our uh our eyes could not see the worst repairer he even uses uh this leans to just to see that that very important part and if it is you know if you misplace that very important the small part all you have to do is take off get this watch from your hands and you know hallelujah you cannot use it anymore it's the same thing maybe some of you uh became upset because i am just no brothers and sisters every one of us is hallelujah important in that body hallelujah and we should support hallelujah from whom the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that with every joint supplies hallelujah supplies according to the effectual working hallelujah you know brothers and sisters there is no hallelujah preacher that can preach a good sermon without somebody who is secretly praying for his pastor hallelujah no one can go to mission new mission without somebody who is secretly doing his part giving his part hallelujah and nobody sees it hallelujah but verses as long as you are doing your part and god will bless you hallelujah continue to do your part hallelujah and god will bless you hallelujah uh one more question this is and it was so masterly built that when the temple went together it had all kinds of little funny looking stones in it but when they began to read the blueprint it was all in the blueprint and there wasn't not even a boss of a soul or sound of a hammer for 40 years in building the temple i think that's the way god's got his people all cut out once god a nature of one kind one another but they are all christians fitted stones joined together upon the cheap corner cornerstone jesus christ christ jesus oh there's the main thing so many rejected the precious cornerstone where we are all built together cemented together with god's love that's the most important practitioner cemented together with god's love that's right god's love and when we have that there's nothing will separate us there's nothing can divide us as long as we love one another i've been a minister for 61 years i've seen all kinds of gifts i've seen god do great things but the greatest thing i have ever seen in my life was love it's the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love love that mo almighty god god's love the world that he gave his only begotten son love is a great great k-note seeing we live out it's something that's eternal hallelujah god bless you all and i give now back the time to [Applause] amen yeah that's all stan musicians come if you have a need tonight the temple how many times have we been speaking on the tabernacle brother louise how many times we've been talking about exactly what our brother is talking about tonight and that's where god dwells he doesn't dwell in wood and paper and cloth he dwells in the human heart amen and he wants that human heart to be right as our brother says it fit together fitly joined together and compacted i like that word compacted that's right because that's pounding compacted put it together because you can put a lot more in something when you compact it when you put when you keep pushing down a little bit more a little bit more you can just keep stacking it on top of each other and that's what we want more of god stacked inside of us amen let's sing a song we have a new tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just think about your blessings when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am blind i am blessed sing it to him think about your blessings i am blessed we're blessed to hear a word of god that we heard tonight we're blessed to be the bride of jesus christ every day that i live i am glad when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest [Applause] [Music] oh i am blessed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am blessed i [Music] amen we're blessed to have a fivefold ministry we're blessed to have a an international flower garden the word of god that comes from different angles and you know we've been covering tabernacle louise been covering the tabernacle now brother uh landlands come in and and talked about the tabernacle so god must be wanting to be in a tabernacle [Music] he must be wanting us to see that where he's at exactly he's not in a church he's in a people and that people is like our brother said and i was thinking about this [Music] 40 years there was not a sound of a hammer think about that not 40 minutes not 40 days 40 years half of your life there was no sound of a hammer they made that thing and chiseled it over here like he said in the philippines they made a part over here in jamaica they made a part over here and then when they all fit together there was none of this hello somebody come on there was none of this i'm better than you are and i fit here this is where i feel i feel right here right no it all just came right together and the bible tells us there was silence in heaven amen for the space of a half an hour long there was silence in jerusalem for 40 years no fighting no fussing no i want to get on i want to be the first beam no i want to be the first being nope every beam just fell right in line amen that's what god's looking for now he's looking for us to fit together not fight together fit together amen all of us fit together and bring someone from several thousand miles away that's uh that preaches the word of god to us and we sure appreciate that we appreciate god giving us a five-fold ministry not just one but five full ministry to bring that it the same subject at a different angle so that maybe you didn't get what i was talking about or you didn't get what luis was talking about but you got what our brother was talking about about the tabernacle so we're all the tabernacle of god we appreciate our brother let's give him another hand if you happen to have anything else you'd like to give him i'm sure he could use it on his journey he'll be here for another month almost so well it will be a month yeah september late and september is when he's leaving going back home so uh we love him we appreciate him uh we thank all that we we love we have a big old place in our heart for the philippines a big old place in our heart for jamaica so that's just where we enjoy uh the people enjoy the fellowship that's just part of the body because there's another church that they they do work in the congo and they do work in this part and that part so everybody's pulling together pulling the load and i like he said i really appreciate this church being mission minded and you given that part because without your without your funding we can't send the money to the philippines or to the jamaica or wherever we send them to it's it comes from your heart and your pocketbook so we appreciate that we appreciate god giving us good jobs i appreciate god giving us a good uh giving us brother john to tell us how to use that money man been really enjoying that you know i thought that financial piece me and june did for several times we taught it here at the church and it brings back old memories about uh uh learning how to save and and how to uh how to manage your money so we

a report but you know what that's just a that's just a name to god to man it puts you in a tizzy but to god why did why did the prophet the first thing that angel said that nothing will stand in your way not even cancer because cancer was the big bully at the time cancer was the thing if you got you said that word you died that's right now it now like brother brown said he said now we we're coming
