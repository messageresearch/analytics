the body to knit together and all be well and all the pain and Agony be away we ask you to God each one Lord forgive us and cleanse us because we want to stand completing you that your light shine in each one of our hearts in Jesus name amen Ephesians come on everybody would be I use the same scripture for you know to stay on the topic and and that way at least you can say well we get to know that scripture anyway because we State on Revelations one for 25 or 30 services and now we're making this number 10 on this one reading from Ephesians so I hope you'll read the whole read it and see it's the whole Plan of Redemption is right here in the in the first chapter of Ephesians this is verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us untrue the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he have to bounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself to do what now that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now Titus is hard to find but right behind Timothy I'm glad to have Timothy with us too and I haven't seen him in a while and saw him back there this morning because it'd be kind of hard not to be able to see him yeah he's pretty big fella and glad to see you Timothy Titus the second chapter and we'll begin reading about verse 11. for the grace that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men teaching us I like that I got written in my Bible grace is teaching us Titus second chapter verse 11. for the grace of God that bring us salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us now what denying the ungodedness and worldly Lush we should live us live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God In Our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself Forest that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself that peculiar people azaleas of good works you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been on predestination and we're still on it you know because we haven't covered it but we've been trying to talk about you know how it transpires and what comes to pass I hope you've understood the things I've tried to bring out about it and we will keep saying things about it but the main point is to see that God is not a respecter of persons uh so he has a way of doing things that uh the thing for him can't say why did you form me this way because it's not that away we form ourselves but then predestination see is actually the word is we're using it now and I'm not a English major whatsoever so forgive me but see predestination is actually a past tense when you put like that onto it and we'll talk about it in a minute of redeem and Redemption but see when you're talking about predestination it means that the destiny is already the term you know determined in God but yet it has not maybe been fulfilled right because see you're saying predestination if you just said predestinate see you you could stop at a point and and and do that but not not in the basis of when you're saying predestination because you're dealing with a finished product but now like I said watch it it's not necessarily that it's already finished but it's meaning that the one who done the predestinating you know was capable of looking all the way through and seeing it totally finished all right because that's predestinations and that's why I kept emphasizing what wrote around him had said that predestination now even the finished product is still looking back to foreknowledge because that way then you're dealing with the one who done the thinking you know and knowing that he's the one who can predestinate and then the full Destiny will be finished one day because you know it's not over yet and even when we walk out of here in a Rapture it's still not over you got the Jews and their part that there's a predestination to that and then you've got all of the other things coming but see that's what I want you to think about in the word redeem that's the reason I chose Titus in to using the word redeem all right we all know that the word redeem means to bring back or buy back all right we'll get to those things but see Redemption is meaning the the completion over here anybody listening the Redemption means that something has come already into existence and it's already in the process of traveling Through Time to to bring it to a place that it can be a finished product but now whereas the word redeem the is not traveling forward you know the word Redemption she is looking out dire see you're looking out there to something but the word redeem if mean if you're going back that away you're trying to find out where you came from right all right now keep that in mind and it'll help you you'll understand why I've emphasized it you know the word Eternal means that you go just as far that away but if you can't go just as far back that away is you can that away with your plan of of Eternity then you you there's no way to know that you're correct right but then the only problem you see the the part I said is you go back to find out who done the predestinating and that's what we've been trying to do is to see how God could predestinate and make it a predestination to go all the way through and not be a respect to a person and come out to the to the right way all right now so we want to do with the same word redeem we want to make sure that we can look back because in the scripture we read here in Ephesians it talks about the the Redemption yeah and it's a basic word that's used more than the word redeemed the word redeem in the New Testament only used I think twice I believe that's correct it's in Titus in the is one other Galatians all right and uh so then think with me about what I'm trying to say to redeem something is to actually take it back to its originality right all right see now you say well I'm going to restore a 55 Chevrolet that's what we think about a redeeming part but it's impossible to restore one you say no no no no we put every piece back on that's that's not the point that's right if you're going to restore it you would have to build it right you know and it's not building from used parts that are 100 years old it would be building it from the original right off the assembly line and that's impossible to do right so then we get our mind hooked into what we think Redemption means and things like that and and sometimes it doesn't mean especially in scriptural terms so get the point now and then we'll we'll back up and go on the when you're talking about Redemption watch it hey Redemption through his blood so we have a finished product but that's what God is looking at because if we haven't fulfilled that we're still in the travel process so you'll see that in the scriptures you'll have doing it but now Hebrews 9 15 calls it Eternal Redemption all right now I like that now we can go back with it as far as we need to go back with it on Eternal Redemption because just remember one thing that one time God stamped something he can never change his mind right you can't have another thought you can't think of another way of doing something once he says that it's finished we agree yeah well you know see it's hard to keep preaching because then when are we going to believe that's right that God has set forth the whole plan he just wants us to believe it right and to walk in it right right and that we're just as eternal and soul as we'll ever be right the soul is redeemed yes yes sir man past tense all right but we're still in the Redemption of the body because it's coming true all right so now keep these in mind and we'll we'll back up to it a little bit more in a minute but I want that thought in your mind of the point of what I'm trying to get across to you all right now so we ended up this morning on talking about the predestination and and my wife said I read something wrong this morning so when I read something wrong you you put it under the way it's supposed to be you just look at it and come into my ignorance and and forgive me and I try to do the best I can but to get in such a big hurry trying to you know you have a 23 notes you want to read and you're trying to to help the people and you're standing there reading and you're thinking those people ain't they want you to shut up they want you to shut up they want you to shut up that's the thoughts you're getting you know yeah so you know give them the notes I'm going on but uh forgive me all right but now listen we talked about that the prophet said we always was eternal right do not believe that but see that's looking at it from the way God looks at it right because me looking at it I realize that as I gave the quote this morning that there was a time I had a beginning so it definitely can't be speaking of this body so let's get that all out of our mind see that's that's what now forgive me listen now I try to explain something and I know that it's hard to do which see you said well I ain't got my money my body's not involved people would swear to you about that and fight you on the basis of saying I'm not talking about my body well I come out of the Baptist Church and as I said this morning they had the the doctrine of one God all right and that argued that there was only one God I mean they would they would you know I would I would be you know it really Stern there's just one God the Bible says it you know but see in my thinking I was thinking because that's what I've been taught that it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity that's when brother Modi said what do you believe in that's what I told him and he said you're just this trinitarian this the rest of my person's a personality personalities and individual individuals a person you just this Trinity is any Trinity and I looked at him and said it I didn't back up I said don't believe that no more well see I've seen that what we were doing was words from our mouth was saying one thing but thoughts in our heart was believing another thing all right now are you with me right see then that's the way we can be about predestination right that's the way we can be about Redemption if we can swear people will stay but but brother Dale I'm not talking about the body and then you said this moment you spend if I told her there's more muscle has been you know stretched and pulled by people in front of the mirror you know reflecting their muscles in their head by weight lifting I mean because we all have that idea see this body is involved whether you like it or not this body is the one that's portraying amen what is within it right and you know you start changing your styles there's something wrong with about what you're doing evidently no you didn't like the other style and it may be forever now but you know you're calling your Higher One Way and then you start calling another why well I just want to come out another way no you saw somebody you liked it or something you know see we're still tied to this old body and this body is controlling us whether we like to believe it or not and he's still involved all right now it is that way so much until the human body of the Lord Jesus Christ I had a controlling Factor now I don't know how to say it no education but it had a controlling Factor upon his life because he was laying down in a ship one night asleep because he was tired now I know what wrote around him I know the old messages are going but you've got to keep him to where he's tired and then you gotta then you can bring it down to where he says that he would just really back here acting like he's asleep he won't see what they do you know I know the story so let's just get all the story all right but now listen we say we always were you know I always was eternal like I said in the same message that that's within the prophet said if you have eternal life so now I emphasize that the quotes I gave this morning is not all of what he said about it you know it's just some some ones you read all of them to where the Prophet was saying if you have eternal life you always was eternal right meaning what there was a time you didn't have it there was a time you received it and the day you received it you were just as eternal as you ever will be now that would be in your soul it's not talking about your body and spirit right but then I was trying to emphasize that that one day there will be a foolish virgin given eternal life but we would agree wholeheartedly that in the Earthly journey of that individual there was no place that that individual could claim originality of eternal life they couldn't say when I was down through there and I felt now they find out that they missed it but they're giving eternal life but when they're giving eternal life then they can say this he liked this life I now have as Paul said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God in other words I have eternal life see then just remember that if is the question right right if you have eternal life the eternal life you have see then John's correct in the basis of saying if that seed remains in you you can't sin that's right why it's not that you can't do wrong because we sin every day right it's the seed it can't sin all right all right she didn't get into that basis and thinking about it then we must realize that the quotes that are used can be used in any form we want to you know and and thereby we can prove a point by what we're saying and you can get into where people don't want to talk about it and they ain't doing us thinking about it the other day do you know what a uh uh in the court of law they have that thing there that you you can't answer you can't ask certain questions because it's called a form called a leading question all right and and by that you say okay now brother Donnie you answer my question yes or no now you're not allowed to comment because that's where they make it to you see you answer this question yes or no do you beat your wife anymore you see what I'm asking if he says no I said your honor you see he would guilt in doing it because and they surely don't want to say yes Joe that's a leading question I find that used in the people of the message because they lay down a situation to you think that even you will answer and agree to the situation that's being laid down but then in the final analysis of the question I can say to you okay now Brothers now we believe everything brother says don't we we believe everything he says all right now so I'm gonna cost you something see if you believe it you always was eternal I see answer that yes or no if you say no you're denying the truth if you say yes you're making a false Doctrine so you can't answer that yes or no can you so much you got to do when they ask you a question is you got to turn to the judge and you say your honor I will answer that question only if you allow me to comment see that way see Donnie could say now I'm on the way I'm going to answer his question is allow me to comment and see if they don't allow you to comment then they can't use it then you'd say when I listen the way he stated that and I answered no and had no reference that I'd ever done it before I never would do it again see you've answered the question right no now that's the way to me that I look at the Bible and the prophet's message you gotta agree with what the prophet has said right you'd be a total idiot not to not agree with what the Bible says all right and then where someone like Dave and he said Lord not word have I hid in my heart then I might not sin against it me knowing what he's done right then it turned out that it must be revealed to us what is being said if you understand David do you ever do anything wrong man I'm the worst of all well how can you make a statement like that see what everybody thinks now here's the point and it's got a truth to it now see it's what I'm I'm laying down some little things for you to think of them see there's the truth that David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin you could say that's pointing down to a person with a new birth okay that's the truth you see David said it in the spirit and even though David sinned Nathan said David you will not die right from that David brought forth blessed is the man to whom God will not impute I reckon or keep countless sin see listen bro survival that away let's approach the the message of the hour that away that we wait for God to reveal something to us instead of just saying I can show you the quote I don't agree with you because right around says so and so we'll bring it and let's put it in the message with it you know it doesn't bother me whatsoever for you to bring it and say well look what he said here I enjoy that because I realize that if he is a prophet and unless it is some human error that he has made which we know he was subject to those things are saying five hundred five seven five thousand seven hundred whatever we would realize that things will have to come together and then we'll realize one thing for sure there is no other way to say it then the way brought around said it there is no other way of saying anything than the way the Bible said it they have tried let's see what was it I've mentioned another day a while back they have tried to improve upon which one was it is it John 3 16. come on the Lord's Prayer believe it truth the Lord's Prayer all right they've tried to improve upon that he said they've always tried to improve upon that one prior you know we're teaching us to pray now not John 17 that's right he said there's no way they can add anything to it or take anything from it because it's so perfect so at one night when brother Harris had a kidney uh stone that was killing him and I've never seen a man hurt that much so I mean it just it would hit him and just hit him into this that kidney stone you that had him and we were sitting in a place eating and he looked at me and he said God damn he said I'm dying from Pain and then from one second I saw a black man almost turned white I don't mean that wrong you just turned real pale looking and I mean just started sweating just running off of him I realized he was in pain you know terrific pain they and we prayed and we prayed and we prayed and finally we all got together and we said the Lord's Prayer not sure he went on to the hospital and had to have it removed Etc that's fine but you know what all at once he was just totally free of the pain see they can't add to the Lord's Prayer okay I won't charge you just try to get a point to your mind because you see that's the way I do when I look at the message of the hour I don't look at what quotes I can find to prove my point I actually look for things to see if brother Branham said something will tear down my point I spend as much time to tear down as I do trying to build up I just get and go preach it yeah and that's why there's so much happening do a lot less air off we just took our time yeah you may be nervous but I'm not you know I'm trying to do the best I can but see we can look at things and we can say well this is what I believe well why do you believe it that way now we were talking this morning right at the end worth it you know we were talking about the the seed and the finishing up and we're not finished on that we will get back to it you know so I wanna I want to read a couple of things before we go into the red part of redeeming so look at number one a now I brought these and it's you know I do it I pick up things later and get to thinking about it so look at 1A the message called communion one of the the great things that they spend a lot of time dwelling upon and you know people do it's the last message wrote around and preached which would be paragraph 49 the communion 65 12. what was it there was another William Brown see a little spot of eternal life down there and show everybody says see there was born with a spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there okay now remember it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed right 154 Church age book then I looked up to the trees I've seen you fall off last year and what are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here it was the eternal life working in the body then one day as I walked on to what that voice talking don't never Smoke Drink and so forth the young Fellers and all I got older and see there was something moving we get all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brown there's something calling Mike my little eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open it up I want to come on there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more see now we stand Justified as though we never had sin in the presence of God so now everybody takes that and they take it and they'll use it like I said they use that quote we were talking this morning always was eternal and then this they shut their minds off totally and won't listen to any uh form of understanding and I know what that is because I I know what it's done you talked to a a good uh any any denominational person especially something that are pretty well read especially say a badges and you try to concern him the the truth of one true and living God and he'll say this I can't accept that Doctrine because if I deny the father I'll deny the son and he'll quote you scripture and it's true what he quotes If you deny the father then you automatically denying the sun because it's one person but the scripture see is saying If you deny the father Son and Holy Ghost as being one you're denying the truth but you can't have one God without having Father Son and Holy Ghost all right so if you deny you're a Tunis you know you cut down one you cut hey but you see we want to make it to work that we want something down in there and see then it you know it can be we want something to hold on to and it's identically the same thing as saying I've been good I'll quote brother random brother Brown when he was shot by that gun and was thought he was dying and was falling and you know in the trance and things and going downward what did he say he said Lord the only thing good I've got to see people say boy that just turned him around right there and seen him right back that one what turned him around hey what does what people will say dude look at that the only thing that he had done was he had committed adultery so that turned him around all right and then you find out that type of person has got to get an adultery problem somewhere back to their lineage or through their their families or something and they're trying to justify things all right but now listen people want to take when veteran made that statement then they want to jump over see and and try to pick up something let's just keep on reading let's read on Christ the mystery God revealed was preached in 1963 728 page 67. you can't commit adultery you're already impregnated Glory he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed than anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has to come to life no world can get in oh oh and we'd like to stay on this for about an hour I'm sure you understand Christ in his alone already finished the seed was Dire the seed was already seed was already listen when was it put dark before the foundation of the world so now you have a statement from the prophet that looks like that some kind of little seed was born in there something about the word and then you have him telling you where that when that was put there it was put there before the world began so was she William Branham back there before the world began as a person for it to be able to be put it in asking the question is he saying that he was back there what part of him was back there any part you put back there you see where the trouble would be he says it was put there before the foundation of the world now before the foundation of the world we could only be in the mind of God which one is correct going down works as Faith expressed 1965 11 26. now here predestinated plan is in plain view just as other seed the word of God is a seed that must have the ground prepared beforehand if you shall see just throw it out there on the ground you wouldn't do no good the birds were picking up you throw it among thistles and thorns and choking out pretty soon Jesus's Parable said so the ground has to be made ready first all right now keep reading so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you you for the foundation of the world to receive him in this age before you knew you by four not his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you now did you come into the world with eternal life did you come into the world with a seed dwelling down within you if it did where was it put and when it was put when was it put though he said it was before the world he said he prepared us before the world so we need to consider then it's the seed he's talking about the seed is his word now we've done been through where the little woman at the well she had representation from predestination in other words God knew she would want to be saved sometimes well did she have to have something stamped in there is my point or was it God's foreknowledge that all he had to do was cross your path yeah which one was it do we talk about redeem but you better be careful because you might redeem yourself out of existence that's what most people do with it me all right now I believe what the prophet said because he's trying to explain the difference between the we call it Bride is a word where you use it or chosen of God and everybody else but you know in explaining that he calls it non-seed hmm and we preached on it a while back on that what is non-seed let's not see no none seed is a seed that can make all of the popcorn you I mean though cornbread if you want but it has no life that's why you look out here and you see it all across the land that's what John saw on Patmos when he saw the church of the church because it's beautiful look at them out there he flew the church right across over here they're feeding the poor how many of us are feeding the blood on a certain day they'd come by here and pick up food are we doing that what's the difference then none seed you mean you tell me that those Pharisees wasn't religious you mean you tell me that if you're organized religion today is not religious yes they are there's a lot of difference in religion and Christianity but the difference between the two is one of them with the seed that's quickened alive and the other one you can never be quick unto them because in none seed we've got it right over the next page you'll turn over to number one on your notes and then start you'll see and I forgot to bring this or I read you what it goes this is 152 I'll read you what goes right before 162. most of you know it anyway we've been over and over and over we did not become seed by rebirth we were seen and therefore were reborn now that's not on your nose so don't for only the elect can be Reborn now reborn means to be born again right right and that's what Jesus said to Nicodemus and Nicodemus knew the natural he knew exactly the wording the man brought he knew that to be born again meant you would have to have a another beginning Nicodemus knew that he wouldn't have done it Jesus didn't say what you needed to be saved not bad he said you must be born again Born Again means to be doing it again you see Nicodemus says you mean if I do it again I go back to my mother but he couldn't understand what Jesus was saying because he knew the word re coming before born means that some way you existed before you got to go back and come back through your mother again because that would be reborn see when you put that Ray on there that means that it existed before it happened before you see Jesus was telling Nicodemus your first birth is what killed you you must be reborn my original says You must be born from above in other words born from where I come from I'm going to have to die give my life before this can ever transpire she's not all written there you know because remember some way oh ever who wrote that Matthew you know he must have heard that from somebody else because was he sitting up there when Jesus and Nicodemus was together I don't know maybe he was but maybe he heard it later too because like Luke and some of them she was Luke and Mark were not original disciples all right but my point is what listen we did not become seed by the rebirth so then there's got to be a seed some way that we can get to bring it correctly you remember what we were bringing out when we preached a couple of messages on The Germ of life you've never seen all you want to but for German life is not in that seed it will not reproduce correct and what is the germ of life it is totally invisible science cannot find it science cannot find the germ of life it is totally invisible all of their x-rays all of their doings can't find the germ of life but you you know I don't like to use the natural story so much but them old chickens them old dogs and horses and them cows and they eat things and and then once the tree comes up where'd it come from the grass comes up where'd it come from you didn't plan it it was in that you know the thing the chickens dropped but where could you find it all right now if that be true then you know that you can't find the germ of life well then you couldn't find the germ of eternal life the one we read the prophet said you had in you the gene of eternal life because remember in in uh studying your biology I guess is what it seemed isn't it which one's it in other words you go from a gene to a germ and if they can't find a germ you surely can't find the gene because a gene is the process beginning before the germ my point is you can't find it all right everybody got that all right then you couldn't find the word that was in you thank you so brother Brandon wouldn't say it when I was born into the world there was some kind of something displaced down in there but he said it's just like that I was in my father he said I was in my grandfather he said I was in my great-grandfather the DNA now if you can chase it back for hundreds of generations prove and all of those are direct descendants all right then we must be able to redeem back the reward redeemed must go all the way back past once you've had as a human being and what would you have before the work if you can't find the germ of life for the human being and then you keep going backwards where are you going that's what I said now if you can't go you can go that way you talk about it that way but can you talk about it going backwards if you can't then you don't know what eternity is right all right so now can we get down in a minute we got your quotes on down here where you say but brother Dale we bypass start theophany right all right now see by your own technology or what would be the word your own terminology excuse me you're going to try to make it to be something that when you do you you start the word redeeming backwards and you're going to clean out of the existence and you prove you're wrong it's not going to get touchy before we get through with it because if you can go that away with and see the end of it is something that's fully redeemed if you can't go that far back that way you don't know what you're talking about well I just believe right now we don't have to understand all them things you're just too deep of heart your profit is the one I'm quoting why don't you call him deep but now are you following me we did not become seed by the rebirth I agree with that 100 all the way down you didn't become a son of God this is way down the road you didn't become a Son of God by the new birth do you have to always be one because that's the only way you could be born again I want you to think I want you to pray you said you're you just confusing me well then that gives you a chance to pray for God to unclog the the things because like I've always told you I'm not confusing you I'm exposing our own confusion I said our mine as well as yours because we've got to get the whole Plan of Redemption because we were sick there's a reason we could be quick so you say well now you say you believe that we were seed but you but you don't believe it was some kind of something put there why does it have to be put down was it in your genealogy coming down that something was put there how was you in your great grandfather it had to be a gene connection something you can't see right a lot of what they tell you is this flat theories you know right they can go back so far with their machineries and stuff but then after they go so far there's this theories of this and theories of that you know we quoted as being true but see this is what I want you to get this point and then because I know we won't get on Redemption the way I want to but looking out number one on your notes because this is continue 152 that was 152. this is continue on reading hold this in your mind yeah you did not become seed by the rebirth you were seed and could be born again you did not become and be careful now remember and take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own don't know if he bought it back it meant something that went wrong right we sold ourselves I hope you get that one of these days we God didn't put us in a pawn shop and then go get us out of the pawn shop we put ourselves in the pawn shop our representation of our our genetic back through time put us into the existence that we're in Adam and Eve only represented us right they didn't make me and you do what we done we've done it cause we wanted to right I hope that'll down on this one of these days the shed Blood Bought back his own he bought back the spoken word see bright so that meant she was away from me she was lost doomed and on her way to hell and deserves every bit of but yet it's predestination let him look down through didn't you and he knew what we'd accept see you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep now see there's you got one now you've got about two more where brother Branham says that I was a Pig turned into a the Sheep so now what's he doing you see contrary to his own quote no he's explaining something now he's explaining the word word seed you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind of there is no change in species he's taking you all the way back in the word redeem but we were born of cocoa butter you want that quote and he said as long as we're in this body will be sticky I just don't know which one to believe why not believe it all right right because if you're sticky in your soul then you're lost right right so inside of you can be eternal life beautiful and wonderful but your body and spirit is still weak I mean still tires the new birth never converted our body and our spirit it only converted to Soul all right see as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God we've heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son Save Me Oh My Father I'm returning to thee now look at the next illustration a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes it that he's a son and he goes and starts explaining about the evil the that you wouldn't you wouldn't the dog you wouldn't have picked is what God is looking at you always was his child right that's why you could be born again now what's he explaining whereas upon the other illustrations when you're talking about a wolf and a or something like that or a Thistle and turned into a wheat he's talking about what the bird does you know that little eagle he wasn't born to chicken he thought he was but he wasn't born the chicken they didn't put a chicken egg under the hen and it's hatched out an eagle come on he said you can go a long time without recognizing it how many years folks is it taken for this message to be preached to us for us to recognize and see by the word of God who we are when we were born again a long time ago but we're now recognizing it right sister Gail recognizing Who We Are what we're doing here do you think we'll take that the story of the eagle said see there but remember he wasn't born a chicken if he was born the chicken and then turned into an eagle you could use the illustration he was born an eagle you just recognized that he wouldn't that year was born again that old kookaburra turned into a wheat an old dog turned into it a dove an old snake that we used to be turned into a dove because that's what the new birth doing but then we'd go a long time before we ever realized who we really are see this message is the only thing that can show you who you are there is no message no words else can show it to you right the denominations had all those years and even in the great teachings that they had and the wonderful things that were even true today stand up and say I am let's see if you'll swallowing this could any of them stand up and even how many in this message could make this statement I am not a son of God that's only my title right for you to reference too all right see I say things ahead of time see how you'll relax you know I give amens out of it and then I get old knees when you really get down to what I'm talking about but one of these days you'll learn that but you see I am not the child the son oh Sam and Hannah Dale and we're not denying our natural birth right come on don't be silly run around and wouldn't denying he was William were flatter them he wouldn't William no more well what do you call himself he might not have lived too long after then because that was the 12-12 that's in December the 12th and he had to wreck about the 21 20th 18th 20th or something I guess the rest of them days he said my name is swordsman I'm not William Brown well brother Brown I'm not brother Brandon no no no I'm not brother Brandon I don't find out who I am well who are you I can't tell you I'm not with you no no he went right on it's like I've always said to you about the Lord Jesus run around and said to the Lord Jesus never call Mary his mother right right would you think that I would be calling him a liar to say that when he was a baby going in a cradle he'd look up and say who are you no he said Mama come on probably the day he died he said but right for him he said Mama I gotta hope you do you do it oh no brother damn he never called her mother no he didn't he never gave her the signification of showing that she was his God but he always gave honor and respect to her his life staying on the cross was what John he holds your mother take care of her right see we get all these great doctrines that we think are so wonderful I believe her brother Randall was here today I'm screaming the amen when he said he never called her mother he's meaning he never gave her the place our position to be his mother in the the point of something Supernatural but he honored her every day with the fact of who she was but he never made her higher than him because if she was his mother she would have been greater than him a mother is greater than a son we never gave her the the point of showing that she was his mother that way but she was his mama she brought him into the world she nourished him yeah that's where we think we know what we're talking about a son can go a long time before he recognizes who he is I've been in this message 40 something years you know what I'm just now beginning to realize as I am about 1971 if I'd have said that I'm not a son of God you'd have looked at me real hard wouldn't you you see brother Mo I think we better talk this over because I think brother Dale's getting lost in just a little bit there you know because he's now saying that he's not a son of God he's saying he's gone what what's wrong Jesus you agree with it this morning this was God made manifest called a son but he wasn't a son because the son has a beginning that eternal life inside of him never had a beginning right amen that eternal life in you makes you what people call the son of God right because you're God in another form but it's what you are you almighty God where his offspring the difference between us and him and the bases of coming we can look back down through our great granddaddies and things and find things we don't like because that's DNA but you don't have anything about my father I don't like it you know Paul said he came to him one day and heard him pray and said Papa get come to the place with God to him was his papa and you know what God had come to the place that that was not just his son standing there but that he was standing there in another body and that would connect us to it see where his offspring we are the children of God right the children of God as God made manifest in another form I thought we believe that's what the bride was that she was the amorphy of God I thought we believe that's the way that it don't turn out to be Trinity sometimes how that God can manifest himself in many forms but it's the same God we want to hold on to the Eternal son there's no such thing there's not an eternal sun today if Jesus wasn't Eternal something we can't be an eternal son we can be the children of God that are Eternal yes and we can call them ourselves sons and daughters and he's proud to do that because we're his children but he looks down and sees his own life but like I told you now I'm I'm stopping here because I can't go no further with these notes like I told you if Adam was away most people thinks he was then God created a body in a spirit and put his own soul into Adam and that'd make him God he wouldn't be at him no God made brother Brown said Blasphemous names Adam a moving leaving human being he made him a body of spirit and soul then he put eternal life in his soul that didn't make him God that made him Adam but you know who he was he was the son of God he was a little God it was God standing there in flesh but connected to a soul of a human being that God had created yeah man that's the wonderful story of redemption if there is something about us that can be redeemed because it means that it was there to begin with they think on these things sit back and use I call it what is that word I use I call it the law of elimination thank you somebody said it so I look at something from the law of elimination if I say something that doesn't work I just eliminate lemonade you know if I look into the Bible and I see something that exalts me and you as human beings I eliminate that but yet when I look at the Bible and I see that the Bible is showing me that I am God made manifest call the Sun I want to accept my position but you say well brother they'll look like the dirty part now listen I'm not talking about somebody that's living in sin now that's not what I'm talking about it's some kind of a sinful person that's coming up telling me look boy bless God I'm god well that when you start saying it like that you know the man don't know what the world he's talking about but if a person says God has made me this and I want to live the life that I can I want to walk that I can I want to talk the things I can I want to be what he wants me to be about you I want to exalt him not myself I want to live come on musician yeah he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love you do wrong brother Dale every day so but my desire is not that let's get it right now right now until there's just no no I won't do love till there could never ever the Lord is that your desire I want to live you don't have to heal me to prove that emotions me or put it on that basement like that and said God if you love me you'll heal me what's wrong what's wrong I love it anybody call my love is not on condition I'll love him if he helps me what kind of person or God didn't why wouldn't we want to be what God wants us to be with what he made us oh wait foreign what he's taking us from look where we come from what he's made is an Old Farm Boy when you listen raggedy Club shoes you're gonna get a second about where you come from Rush's words what else could we want oh foreign we just ask you to be with us as we go our separate ways and Lord let your love be made manifest to each one of our hearts and lives May what we've said Lord be worthy of being said we we need you father just come on the scene and speak to us as we Endeavor to try to speak about you because we want everybody to know about Our Father you know you really are Lord how you want to manifest yourself you died that we might be able to live now let us download ourselves that you can live through us and believe me what you want us to be your offspring we love you and we thank you keep us now in Jesus name amen and amen you dismissed in the Bible days oh I was on the way just hold on living longer help me you up today just just hold on always foreign
