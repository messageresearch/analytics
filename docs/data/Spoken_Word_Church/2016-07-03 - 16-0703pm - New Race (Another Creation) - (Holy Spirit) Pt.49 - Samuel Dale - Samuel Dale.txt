see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading at from Revelations 3 and second Peter 1 uh we do we forgot it this morning we were going

quick and uh you know she's got problems with that so she needs a hernia operation so remember that I talked to brother forny this morning and he's doing yesterday he's doing uh better but he still has trouble his blood pressure is still exceedingly High into the 180 over 10 too and uh that's too high so he needs our prayers and everything he's exercising dieting doing everything he can but Satan's just trying to hinder the brother so remember him keep him in your prayers remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother pageants we'll be leaving from here from home there about 12:30 so we can be able to get 12 12:30 where we can be able to get something to eat and get over to the thing so if you want to go let us know now make arrangement where we can get everything to going all right the the announcements from uh in August you know we're this a schedule in August we don't we don't preach a lot in August we schedule uh so in August it is what brother

have anything you want to give to him they'll give you a week to get everything together and then we'll either take it up or get him I talked to him told him I said why don't you just ride down and see us maybe he could do that anyway you know and fellowship with us on that so remember that it'll take care of anything else brother Boyd Sterling remember brother Sterling is to have his pointer

else uh Nanny's got to go the 3rd of August on for a colon i c P every you pronouncing big old words I don't understand them but she's got to do that on the 3r of August so remember her and and that the Lord would take care cuz I'm like this you know we ask and request prayer for somebody that's going for this out of the other you know I'm I've always been this way you know if you ask me to pray for you about going for a an appointment to see what to do I'm going to pray that they don't find anything but I'm also going to pray that the problem goes away cuz there's no need of going into the and he comes out and he said well I can't find nothing well I'm still hurting well I want that hurting gone that's I want that part of it but I can pray and I say well uh sister Scoggin she's going to have hernia surgery well okay until that time comes I'm going to believe God can come on the scene and take it away till when they get to the last moment amen all right then they have to operate praise the Lord everything's great I'm just kind of a little I always told you I'm an optimistic pessimistic person I'm stand this away and I stand that away and I put it all together I just have you know in my life but pray for us you know brother brother my mother's stress test that she had done last week uh went great yeah uh they found just one little spot but was significant enough to do anything amen amen we believe it we believe God will take care of things because he does Amen all right father we thank you for this day in your love and your grace thank you for everything Lord thank you for the healings and the the things that we can testify of your you and your ways Lord and we just ask you to come down speak to our hearts and our lives that we may Lord be what you want us to be and to say the things you would have us to bring forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk upright in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name right Revelations 3:14 okay okay and unto the angel of the Church of the lady you see and dry you say how many more times you going to read he said 48 49 times well you'll learn it one of these days okay and to the angel of the Church of the lady of sins right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness who the beginning of the creation of God and who are we the continuation of that creation all right Simon Peter then 2 and one let's talk about this or excuse me one in verse one Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ who's this talking to not to the world it's to those that are in Christ Jesus Peter speaking to those of like Precious Faith same Faith he had not just the same doctrinal issue but the same New Birth all right Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and to Godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises what that by these these promises the prophet emphasiz it you might be partakers of the divine nature all right we gave it this morning morning a quote from the prophet where he was saying you come into the body of Christ then you have the divine nature okay all right then going having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giv all diligence add to your faith notice it doesn't say add Faith that's right right it says add to your faith something's already there the same faith that Peter had up here okay add to your faith virture and virture knowledge and knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound Heap up pile up B you know they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now to background just a little bit from this morning and then move on into what we're trying to bring uh we have been talking about the stature of a perfect man all right as I was saying this morning just to the background apart to those that hadn't wasn't here to hear it what uh there is two thoughts in the stature of a perfect man and the Believers of the message one group believes I get everything when want to believe you know I got it all today I was born again the other group says well we ain't got it yet well you know both of them got truth right you know that's right sure you do get a lot when you're born again but you do need a lot to be where the disciples were that's all I've tried to say to you because that way Peter can tell you you must have these things brother Bon says these are the things that God expects you to have amen he expects you to have these things all right because they're provided now watch that in the message today now I want you to when I get down to the end of it I'm I don't even know which way I'm going and if I'm in two hours okay I'll be that don't want to do that but I'm going to get to a point that we're going to have to make some outstanding statements that I believe will be helpful to us in the understanding of the message M all right like I told you the other day you look at the pyramid back here behind me as the drawing the one brother randam made of the drawing it says faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness you know godliness brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit and then says love well Peter doesn't say that Peter says faith virtue knowledge temp patient godliness brotherly kindness and love now why would brother random draw it that way because it has to fit perfectly with what he's saying that's right right all right so he draw it that way now let's get down to that to think about it you said well that's just intellectual smart addict things because you can look at it well why didn't your intellect smart addict come up with it and tell me about it you know you you're playing with me I'm playing with you see I'm just saying that those things they have a big meaning to you and I right and they have a place to be placed and when we get down to the last part of the message I want to read you something your Prophet said you mind if I just quote a little bit now he said in Sister Shepherd's dream he said there was a big man pourn water into this Rock Box yep and he said that's the Holy Spirit and he said the meas of this age is the big guy that's pouring the water now you know all about it don't you let's go home no we need some understanding don't we Simplicity of understanding why these things are like this and then the realize that there's no other way that it could be said there is no other way that it could be said if it was God would have said it and he sent a prophet to declare that unto us I thought we believe that the messenger of this age was to bring us the message for the age and the end at all things okay now so when we get down to it we'll talk about it all right now this morning we talked about it cuz I said we've been covering the stature of a perfect man and why would Peter say to add these things if we already had them so this scale Lo runs off to say that we already had all of this that scale runs off because it says you know we already got it well then Peter says to add it yeah right well then this scale says we don't have it I'm talking about the Believers of the message people we don't have it like the book of Acts well there's some truth there right there's some truth there go along with it but then there's more truth too where your Prophet would say and we'll read it in a minute again where he says he met people with the Holy Ghost just exactly like the day of Pentecost well that's his wording see well you you say well I don't understand that well I guess that means it's wrong you know you know you said I don't understand that that does that mean it's wrong are you sensible enough to say I don't understand it but see then why are we so uh hard about people who say they do understand something and talk about it that's intellect let's see your intellect do it I no problem I'm not sarcastic you think I am you think I'm a hateful old dude no I'm serious serious my soul is involved am you know we're here at the end of the world we've had 50 years since the going way of a prophet right all right see you know why not get down and think about things okay now you can't jump WR I remember this I remind you of ever service you got an order it's Faith virtue knowledge Temperance Faith you can't go Faith knowledge patience brotherly kindness and shoot off you got to go the way God ordains it to be am I don't care what you think that has nothing to do with it it's what the word says all right then your Prophet would say you can't do these other things and jump about he said because each one of these virtues is vulcanized together that's right amen and he said if it don't come out to the right place he said it'll crumble and fall yep amen well you just go ahead well I well I've got I've got knowledge well I remember own Blasphemous names referring to the statute of perfect man he said when our mental faith and he said the biggest force of our faith is mental he said becomes a spiritual Revelation then you add it remember we're talking about Revelation we're not talking about just building this or a pyramid or a thought or a this we're talking about what has happened as to Christianity in our ways all right so then you don't just jump up the ladder and go from one to you got to go as W it goes you go Faith the new birth then you add virtue strength right then you can come up to knowledge but you can't go from Faith straight to knowledge I didn't draw the book you know what I didn't write it okay and if these things are required then why not talk about it that's right right of course are you in this group we got everything when well I don't really believe we got everything when to believe but I kind of believe I got everything by now well praise God I hope so you know I mean I hope so no problem I'm hoping that's right but now what does it do then then we come on up Faith virtue knowledge to know the word don't contradict Temperance how to control your temper oh but when I got born again I a had no temper yeah according to Peter you lied yeah now you're going to answer to God about that of saying okay that was good cuz it did take away a lot of things it's supposed to take away a lot more than we need cuz remember Temperance is how to control your temper and you mean God has brought us from the New Birth up through virtue knowledge and temper and then we still got I mean knowledge and then we still got a temper yeah I didn't write the book and then we got to have patience patience God didn't expect you to have patience when you were first born again right he didn't expect you to have knowledge he didn't expect you to have virtue he expected you to be a baby right and like I've always said babies are born babies but they don't have the virtues of a child correct they grow into these things so is it in the body of Christ we must grow into this and each one as you grow upward then see and then coming on up through patience and then godliness and I didn't write the book brother brandham said it you come up to hear before God expects you to be like God or godliness then he goes to Matthew 5:48 right immediately in the same paragraph that he starts about it go read your book he said be therefore perfect he said you've come all of this way before God expects you to be perfect I didn't write the book but see then we got to come to perfect of godliness and to understand now listen to what I'm saying because you you you sometimes I know I don't bring it out I try but see I'm talking about a revelation of things virtue is just not to have manly strength you know right it's to have Holy Ghost virtue amen Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost patience and what is that God revealing himself to you that's as to try to make us to be the children that he desires us to be just as you do in your natural children you see we come up to there then it's required that be therefore perfect it's required to understand Perfection the brother this morning said why don't people if he hears this I'm not going to call his name but he ain't been in the message long and he caught something he said why is it people can't understand what it is to be perfect you see it on the bumper sticker right I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven oh everybody oh wonderful statement is it if you're forgiven you're perfect right cuz you're not guilty right right mhm amen and the brother he what he said he said why don't people catch it he said God said it right and if God said it he required it amen and then when are we going to start talking about it he said that's right okay but listen then you come out of this way before brotherly kindness ever comes into a point you remember that this morning so we're backing up to there now see brotherly kindness comes into view after you've added to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance Pati godliness and then you're expected to have brotherly kindness see what brotherly kindness would be way back down here to the bottom he might not be talking about the brotherly kindness you're talking about because I see hit her to the end and stop this morning but we want to continue the thought all right but it's on paragraph 296 through 303 statute of a perfect man he says you get got all the way up here before you're asked to be perfect in other words for you're asked to have godliness for you're asked to have brotherly kindness now remember the quote we gave this morning brother Brandon said having brotherly kindness he said we can have brotherly kind but he said it's hard to have it in a group right that's in the message it's hard to have it in a group CU you see some people have brotherly kindness but evidently something more about brotherly kindness that we're not really following like I said this morning oh we wonderful we can figure it all out cu we just look at the pyramid Philadelphia that's a six Church a brotherly kindness now according to brother brandom sorry according to brother brandham brotherly kindness goes into lady ofia well I can't see that cuz Lady of sea means people oh Lady of sea means people's rights we don't want that do we brotherly kindness is what this age is required you remember I told you the brother that came by Brother Mo was preaching on it and he said he said don't tell about it so let me go study it 6 months later I'm kidding you he came back by and he preached that the Rapture was going to take place in the sixth Church age because it said Philadelphia and Philadelphia means brotherly love that wasn't that a great Revelation why would it be that this age would be called brotherly kindness I'm asking you a simple question I love questions right we have good time at questions and answers we just sit around and talk and have a wonderful time I love questions and that you know sometimes I like to ask questions well how come that your sixth Church age being Philadelphia would not be called the brotherly kindness age but the seventh Church age which would mean people's rights brotherly kindness is required why for go before God expects us to have godliness he waits for us to come you remember patience God has patience waiting on you and I remember that he has patience throughout the pyramid and he comes and brings it to Godliness and then he says for us to be perfect all right how can we start the fact of being perfect by revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ now so you see that you're getting now required something brotherly kindness is not just a uh an act of kindness amen it is a revelation amen of what the blood of Jesus Christ does for individuals who will receive it amen right you've already been told you're perfect who told us we're perfect who told us I'm saying something way ahead so you just listen to this and remember that a while who told us the understanding of the correct way to be perfect now get off of it I read too you read when we was in the Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian pent costal Catholics we read in the Baptist Church I knew the word perfect did not relate to sinl it related to growth development because I could look up the word and the first Bible I had was a scofi if you go L to Matthew 5:48 you got a scofi Bible look right down below and you'll see that he tells you it does not mean sinless it means a growth development but the main thing of what I'm talking about who was the one to bring the Revelation to this age we talked about the blood of Jesus Christ making us perfect as denominational people right that was preached it but it was preached like this well I'm perfect don't understand how to be perfect you think you're perfect well I don't really understand but the Bible says I'm perfect when he day I get over there be perfect is that not our way of understanding Perfection until the message of the hour came in the message of the hour related us back to the scriptures to show us these things right right thank God for the message that's right all right you'll see in a minute what I mean by that that we didn't understand Perfection until the message came how could we understand godliness until the message came did any of us have any emphasis or thoughts or do they now of anything about godliness how that it means to be like God other than a fact of saying we got to be like God we got to do this and be like God is not being like God like that you remember this morning where was using that scripture they have a form of godliness the kindo priest manifested whole lot more godliness in the natural eyes of mankind than the Lord Jesus did you understand the way I said it in the natural Mankind's understanding the kind old priest manifested but Jesus was God he must have been Godly right if anybody knew how to be Godly it was him you know why cuz it was God okay now how are you and I going to ever understand godliness when we get away from the world I don't know about this I don't know about that maybe that might be right but we're yeah we're the children of God but we just don't understand that that's why you ain't read the message what's the 50 years you've been doing when I tell you I read six books and listened to two tapes in one day day I didn't do that every day but I did that well I don't know what the prophet said on how come that's right you know all about Facebooks and all these movie stars and characters and right we've had 50 years to read one Bible 50 years to read one message and now you got 2,000 split off out of the same message right things even the denominational people wouldn't do that's right I don't mind saying that right you didn't have polygamy and agamies and agamies or whatever it was okay in the babtist church I remember when it was taboo to talk about polygamy but listen godliness then has to come before brotherly kindness or else your brotherly kindness would not have anything to vulcanize to and it would crumble cuz Satan's going to try it right and I told you about and brother Lis the reason they're not here today they're over at brother we's preaching yesterday but he made a good point the other day when he's talking about that virtue would start out here and it grows and fills up you don't start out with all about virtue and all about knowledge it grows into it the whole thing is a growth development all right now listen we talk about perfection we know for certain that only god is perfect all right we know for certain that God is the only one who has these virtues until he died at Calvary to release them y right then you expect expect you and I to have them that was the purpose no the purpose for D was was to be saved now that ain't all the story The Earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased product so Calvary took care of all things but something had not has not been applied that's right brother Brandon said Redemption was paid for for the Jews at C he said but not applied right it's got to be applied so there's something got to be done all right now to try to make it f where we can get to it remember on Statue of perfect man he mentions part then he's over in Blasphemous names and he's talking about a sister having a dream sister Shepherd she had a dream that she was on top of like a mountain or area or something and uh as she was up there she wondered if she had the Holy Spirit or not and he said that she saw this place was like a rock box and said she saw this big strong man we'll read some of these in a second but pouring the beautiful pretty water into the Rock box and said it was boiling out all of the trash and running down the sides but she looked and talked to the man that was standing there and saids why is it that it's boiling out all this but it won't hold he said you cannot put the Holy Ghost into a denomination and things he said individuals are full of the Holy Ghost he said nothing won't hold the Holy Ghost that's what he said then he says the man the same man took and brought some honey and poured it in the rock box and he said it looked like she did said it looked like it was going to bust but said the honey did hold now watch him you mean the Holy Spirit would run out and go over and boil out and he got his job and he said that's what it's doing that's right but the honey would hold the honey would hold the Holy Spirit that's right the Holy Spirit was the water we'll read it the Honey will hold it he said no church and things can't hold the Holy Ghost but the honey would and he said the honey represents brotherly kindness he said it'll hold that's all right so what about it what do you think about it so let's just start reading a little bit now I told you I warned you if I had a little lengthy you forgive me because I got a point to get to and then I'm going to have to go from there look at number one which is Blasphemous names Tak paragraph 119 through 121 he's talking about that each age has had that rock Box you remember we'll read it here is a rock Box sister Shepherd seen a rock Box in other words what was it it was a hun out rock or something right a box and there was man was pouring the water in and it boiling out everything inside the box and running down the mountain all right then pouring the honey in in hell he said every AG had to rock box cuz that's your confession of Jesus Christ right and watch him that's been each ages had the rock confession on up to this rock confession of the lady of see and now you cannot take a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church or a holy organization the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad Renegades indifferent and everything else so an organization will not hold it what the Holy Spirit you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the holy spirit is poured out on individuals it's individuals so therefore the rock watch him this latterday Pentecostal Church which has received the Holy Spirit they did at the first yep yeah so that solves a problem of whether or not that the holy spirit is here like it was the book of Acts that's what he said you said but I don't see it that means God's wrong you say I don't see it that means God's wrong I guess to you maybe we're to look look the Pentecostal Church which has received the Holy Spirit they did at the first all down Through the Ages they had they received the Holy Spirit now watch but not in the measure that they have it now right cuz that's the book of Acts that's the faith of the Father God is the restoration the first we take the Candlestick the Alpha and Omega right all right now soever age has had a rock box cuz that's your confession if you read the book you'll see brother around them explaining Upon This Rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it it's a rock box he's explaining salvation he's not explaining how pretty a pyramid looks or a mountain or a thought right he's explaining the truth watch now look where he goes here now to 367 you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection amen that's plain langely and they're uh they're under sold under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection which is this virtue of godliness and you think I spend all this time talking about godliness to not know where I'm going to read from you say well we just don't have it he's done brought it back to talking about perfection that when Christ does come in this church you see is coming smaller in the minority brother R refers to chalk board draw it's a whole lot sharper than that would just like to write that cross di SE is coming up to a needle point until listen until the church and the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of a Ministry that this left because when The Headstone comes back when this headstone comes back it's got a little pocket like here where it's going to sit right down in there a little pocket A Little Rock Box okay little pocket where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramid it just isn't a cap that sits across the top a regular pyramid is not just a head sitting over the top all right it isn't a c that sits across the top you take this right here and you pull that love down to here and it'll be setting right there your pyramid won't even line up straight that's sensible I don't need a revelation and needs eyeballs to see he's got a little pocket and what's he talking about course he's got a little flange it's a little flange a little flange to us means that hangover out there where you your shingles come down or your roof comes down it hangs over and we call that a flange that's not the side of the pyramid what's he talking about CU we're going to get into what the Holy Ghost really is R around them on blasphemia names what did he say he said the Holy Ghost has been taught but it said ain't been taught correctly it's got a little pocket like here where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramid it just isn't a cap that sits across the top cuz see you can just throw the cap off and everything fall down when we get through with this and you see really what it is you'll see that once that head unites with the body you cannot take one of those stones out of that pyramid amen you got to lift the cap up to be able to get one of them out there's your seal of God it's impossible for it not to be there it's a little flange and it's got to sit on there cuz it sheds the water and when it comes this church has got to be honed come on down coming through perfectly you can't run a razor blade between them weighing tons they got him up there they don't know but they were built and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of of Christ will have to be honed not only just some Creed or doctrine or something other we come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till christly like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together then will come the Rapture and the going home brother Bram is explaining Redemption to some of you that don't understand what we talk about a lot of time the body of Jesus Christ right the body of Jesus Christ is built up and he's the head you can put the body in the pyramid and he's identically fit all right see it's not just talking about pyramids and this that or the other he taking the entire Bible and bringing down all of the visions and relationship throughout the Bible down to know the hour that you and I are living it's not strange words once you understand it is simply The Plan of Redemption God redeeming mankind all right now watching go ahead to number three now this is where we start on the blasphemist name and he's going to tell you uh I believe in those virtues speaking in tongues and shouting all all kind of demonstration I believe in every bit of it but if it if it's there without this take out any of them see there is something wrong see and you see you got a shell notice she was worried about it so she just laid down and on she dreamed a dream and she dreamed she was up on a mountain and in this mountain the best I haven't got the paper on it had a rock Box can I watch that sitting right in top of this mountain and her HUD usband was just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on now watch that man watch him and see where he fits sleev rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen and poured it into this box this Rock Box sitting in top of the mountain and The Rock box would not hold water that's it and it rolled right out of there just boiled up all the trash and the sticks and everything in there and boiled it out and rolled down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her and then she asked why the Box didn't hold it and the man said that's not water the man stand there that's not water that's the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost but remember the man was one that was pouring it in the man in just a minute going to be the messenger ah you're making too much out of brother random no we're just getting it right so that's the Holy Ghost and said nothing will hold it and said then he went back same man and got another big bucket and it was full of honey if you don't follow me and nothing else you just remember one thing had this messenger not come they'd be no honey to pour in that box you can take what you want to there would have been no honey for it to hell so you better value what your understanding of this right Shake Yourself you get sleepy I get sleepy but don't pinch you one next to you cuz that might mess up thing pinch yourself look another big bucket and it was full of honey and poured the honey into there said now it will hold this and she thought that the box was a rock box and was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and it Hil and she turned and went down the mountain right now what about that rock Box what about that talk he says on paragraph 114 now here is the interpretation of the dream may I look at it you look at it and read it but may I say it in these words here's the interpretation of sister Shepherd's dream she's explain she saw the Plan of Salvation she saw the church ages and the water running down she saw the whole thing in dream but it's not just a mountain of this that the other that mountain has got to be in individuals cuz remember only individuals can have the Holy Spirit not churches and so she's talking about the dream was showing her where we at now just like you go to the Book of Daniel and you read One Vision or dream and then you read the next dream and then you read the next dream if you'll read them all together you'll see they're saying the same thing but you're reading it one day and you go back to next next day read another one you what in the world is over here over here one day read it all the way through and see that it's the end time that you're pointing to today for one time sit back and listen and think this sister was showed a dream of this end time and what it would be like brother Junior Jackson saw a dream that goes on over with it of the end time shows you and I and what we're doing right now right okay rock confession Peter said you know who Jesus said who do Man say I the son of man I am well you're this you're that he said but th AR the Christ you remember what happened there he said up on this rock Christ I'll build my church on this Revelation I'll build on my church the church is on the revelation of Jesus Christ right right put all the parts together and what you got so watch him now remember he explains and listen you got to remember from one statement to the next remember he explains a rock box and remember he explains a little flange right now he goes to another dream of Junior Jackson it's going to be the same thing but let's read it so go ahead to number five taken from is it the sign of the end sir and he talks about Junior Jackson had a dream he dreamed a dream and I just sat there and a list and watched he said I dreamed that there was a great big hill looked out in a field where blue grce are something else and said you on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there there was a top rock up on top of the hill like the top of the mountain it was Rock no Grace and when the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings of these rocks and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these rocks that's what brother bran was doing in the message right interpreting and watch you and said all of us here's what he said to Brethren from Georgia around here we're stand our listening to you interpret that mysterious riding on those stones he picked up a crowbar and whipped the top off of it when he did a reckon bar and he said is he done it said you struck the top of the mountain it ripped around and lifted the cap off of it it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top off of it now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached before the statue of perfect man was preached he already Junior Jackson done had this dream and said but beneath the white stone you remember he whooped it off he had to go West connect with the angel come back and preach what was inside cuz it was nothing written there right okay now so watch now he goes on to explain go to number six standing in the Gap well it happened to be that least one man is spred it this morning who was standing there when it happened it actually shook the Earth he talking about a thing and then he was telling I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I was brought here to the east about the Seven Seals so that's the same thing that brother Jackson sing the same thing that sister Shepherd seen explaining the Plan of Salvation and what happened brother brandham had to go West connect with those angels and come back to tell us what was inside but just remember explaining Redemption it ain't explaining a whole bunch of different he saw pyramid Angels he saw a pyramid of where Junior Jackson dream he saw a pyramid of like a mountain with a sister and she had a rock Box on hers the others doesn't mention that part it just goes on to mention other things that come forth all right let me go drop down to number seven I'm going have to byp pass a whole lot because I know I'm dulling some and some you're we're trying to get to it he talks about from Blasphemous name the Rock Box confession the same thing of the Statue of perfect man and then you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing thing as a holy church or a holy organization the Holy Spirit can be preached in there but in there you find good and bad we done read that cuz what did it do therefore the rock which is the latter day Pentecostal they had at the beginning it's talking about the baptism with the Holy Ghost that they had at the beginning and what was it 122 where we at rolling up but in this church age now remember I told you to remember this man was pouring in this water then the same man goes and gets the honey I remember in jerub all I'm going to do is mention it in zerubabel the messenger that brought to former rain is a messenger to bring the L mhm that's jerub right all right this Tabernacle that's where comes to here what but now in this church age the message is being poured into the church sister Shepherd's dream was the Statue of a perfect man the message of the hour being poured into the church who was the messenger who was the big man that was pouring the water the messenger Messenger to this age who's the one that took the hunting ported in who was the one that told us the honey had its position we didn't know nothing about brotherly kindness but it's going to be in a group or is not going to be right and watch him but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church see all of that are those dreams and the thing all the Book of Daniel of all the dreams that were done was showing the Journey of Israel and what would happen to them right yet we read it as being there well wonder what that mean we read wonder what that mean what that mean why not read it right it's all a Plan of Salvation amen will it be sister Shepherd's dream or Junior Jackson's dream right or whether it be the dream he had to go out and connect with the angel it's all the Plan of Salvation I just want you to get the emphasis but what was the water doing and remember the man's pouring the water in the messenger of the church say what's it doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it now that's just not when he died I think the message is still boiling I think it's still being poured in all right not when he died it stopped really when he died it started right cuz people got more serious cuz they had him to run to then well they should have got more serious what was the water doing was boiling out all the tric that's what the Holy Spirit does boils it up oh but brother no brother bandam ain't the Holy Spirit he's the one bringing the word that's right bring the word ring the word the word is Washed by the Water of the word is that scripture come on now the honey represents Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age I just got to telling of Brotherly kindness the age that we live in now that's why it's got to be brotherly kindness for this age now this messenger brought his message right it's boiling out to tr it's still working and the Honey is being added and where are you and I see he goes on to tell you about brotherly kindness and what it was to be we talked about it this morning now just a minute and then we'll get we'll just quit remember the same man that poured the water in is the same man that poured the Holy Ghost in you know the honey same man that poured the water in same man that poured the honey in there's your messenger of this age the messenger of this age brought the message of the word he's not the Holy Spirit don't make him that don't make him the honey he's the point is what is he he was the man pouring the water he was the one used to pour the water he was the one used to pour the honey right right without the washing of the water of the word you and I don't have any hopes that's right there certainly ain't going to be no honey for the brotherly kindness to develop into no we don't give we don't make brother brandom deity and God and all this that and the other no but the message he brought I've been playing with you brother brandom himself was not infallible but the message he brought was infallible you those places he me that was brother brandom that was the man that was not infallible but he corrected those things right the message is infallible why cuz the messenger was pouring the message into the church what is it supposed to be when you and I are listening to tapes and reading books and things is it not that this message is to boil out the things of our lives and show us where the wrongs are and the rights are amen and to bring us to brotherly kindness bring us to a place to where God can live in mankind the way he always wanted to like we were talking about last night what did this message come for brother Brandon's message began in the seals I've got the direct quotes if you want them I've got him because especially if you don't read uh uh Rapture he said not in the years of preparation but said when he begin to sound right the first years of brother brandom was a restoration back to the original faith of the fathers right come on that's right he brought the message to return us back to the faith of the fathers then the seal that's to whipped off the top of the pyramid and he looked down in and saw things that were not even written he goes west connects come back brings the an the word of God if we were talking about last night what is it come on folks get plain and serious we don't need brother Rand to tell us it's wrong for women to cut their High yeah right the Bible says it we don't need it for it to tell the men to not have long high the Bible says it we don't need it to say that wearing the garments pertaining to a man or a woman the Bible speaks of both of them you only read the garments pertaining to a man read the rest of that verse down below there it talks about the women the men wearing women's garments we don't need that listen we didn't have the prophet to come and tell us that was wrong to sin right that's right we didn't have to have the Bible to tell us what sin was I mean the prophet to tell us what sin was that's in the book known as the faith of the fathers statute of a perfect man if you don't believe it go read the book you're supposed to have you ought to be able to find a page brother brother said he waited 30 something years before he could preach that message read the book you'll find it in there 30 something years before he could preach the stature of a perfect man you'll find it relating to patience and he said I've had patient you know all right but the prophet's message begin in the sealed I'll be glad to show you the rest of those but not in his years of preparation but when he began to sound right all of that other was the faith of the fathers being brought back then brother Brandon went West now listen as we talking about last night listen to it the Bible had already spoken of salvation for the soul it spoke of other things but basic as it would say Chang it a moment twinkle of an eye that was a prophecy of a future event and Mankind didn't know that other than the fact well we're going to be changed moment twinkle ey now what's a twinkle they never worried about nothing else right what's a twinkle well it means it it means the eye it means that it means it it means that you heard it over and over didn't you what is the twinkle of an eye never said a word word about the denomination never said a word that it was the word right that would be the message that would change us in a moment in the twinkle of an eye is only what a twinkle was boy we really had it didn't we see it was only prophecies prophecies was speak speak of the chains of the body yes but nobody but the Lord Jesus reach that place now I stay with the Bible no man has approached to immortality this see immortality means mortal made Eternal except Jesus Christ now you can argue all you want to on that that's the Bible right no matter what where you arue the point you're going to come back to that and stand looking at that scripture what is brother random come to do we quoted the scripture that while ago but did you catch it which is the the New Birth the Salvation which is the earnest of our inheritance what until the Redemption of the purchased possession what was the purchased possession this body was redeemed at Calvary right that's right but it's not applied right right page 49 it's in the future home maybe be different on you paragraph 49 of the future home he said the soul is redeemed he said but we're waiting the Redemption of the body amen see this message come for this body to be redeemed right now he had to go back and tell us what they Ted right that's what gets me when they say well brother random and his early Ministry was wrong but then the son of man come straightened him out and boy he got it right on over here well who are you who told you that brother random didn't tell you that the Bible don't tell you that you must have got it from some other source and only know one other right but listen Church the messenger was pouring the message in it was boiling out the trash that's what's happening now you come in the message today and you start reading the book and listen to the tape that Holy Spirit is washing us out right but the water of the washing of the word why wouldn't we want to study the message then why wouldn't it should be more important than anything else in our lives oh my goodness well I want to know who's going to be president well the way it looks now Hillary is probably going to have a she to help her that's going to be double ain't it but if Trump gets it what do you got on that side oh you know what Trump's doing now Trump's got converted supposed to be a born again Christian boy they trying everything in the world to win ain't they no Hillary she just says y'all go ahead and play all you want to I'm going to take who I want to and put them in they got to make their choice in a few days TR come on folks you know what I done that time in the fellowship meeting when I said you want to know who's going to be president I said you thus say the Lord of who's going to be president well everybody just looking at me like what does he know I said the Bible says I put in Kings I take out Kings whoever who he wants whether it be Hillary another woman and Trump all three I think you ought to do it that way I think you ought to make Trump and Hillary co-presidents of course one of them wouldn't live too long right I going to get rid of them okay get you to life and get you to life where you listen now why would it be that when brother randam would draw the stature of a perfect man that he would draw it the way he done it and we have to agree it's authentic you know there's people sitting here that was there and a lot of that was preached and they can give you the authent they give you the fact of knowing that it was true that that's the way he draw it up why did he draw it like that and put Holy Spirit right here and if you lower that headstone down it ain't going to fit the pyramid worth nothing that's natural that's just by looking so let's just don't lower it down let's leave it alone let's let the prophet fill in the sides right are you with me you understand what I mean if you bring that down look where it would be setting it would not be like this it would come down and go over but if you do it like that it's lined up from the bottom let's let him fill in the sides all right and you'll see why he said holy spirit all right he talked of a sister Shepherd's dream he talked of a rock box a rock box is something you know a box got a bottom in it something around rock box right the water was being poured into that and overflowed out the stature represents the Bride of Jesus Christ right the pyramid drawing the pyramid drawing is representative of the body of Christ right brother around and we'll get back to it where he said The Messengers comes up the same way as each individual comes up we get back on to those time just a little thought for you today why would he put Holy Spirit there the brothers we tried to concoct I guess You' call it a little part of the drawing I've done this many years ago but you know cuz I've known this and studied it like this but they're going to try to do it with a drawing go ahead brother and pull up a statue of perfect man and it's not according to scale so okay now here is what's back there on the thing and like I said if you lower this down you're off but if you keep the line straight and fill it in so when you start you're born again at Faith and that Faith keeps building upward and this is being filled in and when it comes up then virtue is vulcanized are sealed into it so is it all the way up to coming all right now go ahead and use the next one I told you it's out of proportion don't lower the head down at all just leave it alone brother Ram spoke of the sister shepherd with a rock box he spoke of the other with a flange he said that flange will shed water remember you don't lower The Headstone you grow up to it you're growing up into it you don't have to lower it you grow up into it here's your rock Box it boils out all the trash brings all this boils it out here's the other part and if if you did lower them on the correct order then you would see if your rock box is down here and your other this fits right over the top of it that's natural see one it goes up you know bring your pyramid in a little bit and then make a rock Box make the other one right reverse and what have you got so you don't lower these to do it that's why we couldn't draw it you don't lower for them but if you put that correctly you would bring that one totally down to here cuz now you can't shed no water I mean you shed all the water now you can't take nothing out unless you take that headstone out that's why she's going to be finished one day that's why it's called the Holy Spirit I'm going to read brother brandom and you come up as each one of these is brought into being it's vulcanized together but as it does the side is being formed the holy spirit is sealing it sealing it sealing it sealing it sealing it and there's your Holy Spirit okay there's your holy spirit that seals you in right the two fits together this one is built up that one comes down you're perfectly set to work you cannot destroy any of that pyramid without taking out that top cuz every rock is vulcanized to it and the outside is sealed you said well what do we got go ahead to number eight Blasphemous names then when we have met these these qualifications and become full of the virtues of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom but you're sealed down at the bottom the baptism of the Holy Ghost it says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption is this new birth right here you're sealed at the new birth but you're now coming to an understanding of what a seal really is you're coming to an understanding what has really happened you're going to fill in the sides and make it work become full of the virtues and things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and sealed us into the kingdom don't worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well I well glory to God I know I got it I spoke with tongues glory to God I know I got it I dance in the spirit you won't have to say a word about it everybody will know you got it now may I say this everybody who knows what it is that's right the world ain't going to never know all about it they ain't going to never accept you come on don't worry about your neighbor you worry about the people of this message okay and look at the last one the stature of a perfect man paragraph 32829 30 then building The Virtue building this Monument building this stature see it starts off with the foundation stone Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these all these virtues they're vocalized together they're sealed together right in there right in here you see I got it between all these Works in here now what's he got hold Spirit right in here right in here you see I got it in between all these Works in here and here are these little ways come what is that the holy ghost coming down watch through Christ and what would brother I'm talking about the Holy Ghost coming through Christ when Christ is the Holy Spirit the holy ghost coming down through Christ that's the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all these things welding these things together building a what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap off something else has got to happen you're looking at the pyramid you're getting what I'm talking about what's it been done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven Church Messengers bringing you to a place The Headstone can unite wait until we get to the church ages and bring the message right here not right here we get up right here and the message will be right amen the prophet will be right but what is it the holy ghost coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit bringing these things together and then The Headstone will you not you say yeah but the head the the Holy Ghost is a headstone amen so was the New Birth that you received the Seal of God but then you're sealed that's adoption right we're going to get to those things eventually right adoption the head and body has to unite but there has to be we you read part of it we read some more there has to be the same Ministry of Jesus Christ before The Headstone can Unite with the body the prophet has done his part he poured in the the the water which is representing the Holy Spirit he preached all of his life out trying his best to get people to see Christ right and who the Holy Ghost really is and what it is and then he lived a life which was unreachable of course now they changing now he done this he done that let them go ahead they just dig in their own grave but he brought brotherly kindness into understanding to you and I brotherly kindness bringing it to where we're at The Messer pouring the message in is what's going to boil out the trash it's also going to seal up the person you're sealed by the word the words you hear either sealed us out or sealed Us in right right amen whatever we hear is going to do one of the two seal Us in or seal us out right but if we take the message complete then it'll be this message as Zechariah says this jerub which represents the prince with God the prince is a child of God that is not King yet but he's coming to be king this messenger is going to do two things right Church age book you need it messenger of Malachi 4 is going to do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers two bring forth the seven Thunders which are the revelations containing in the Seven Seals watch him and it'll be these revely divinely revealed mystery truths that literally brings you and I to a change brings the faith of the fathers it bring the end it'll bring God 50 years I've preached that trying to get somebody to believe it well brother D I read this that the other I believe amen well let's going to Perfection quit being babies that's got to be petted and pampered you know right you mean I could say something to you that would run you off then you're not trusting in the ministry because the next person that can say something to run you off too all you're going to do is wind up being a bunch of runoffs yeah right which but you see Church we're not in no way trying to say that we're this or we're that but why can't the people just like the brother asked me this morning a person that would say why does not people understand that Jesus Christ makes us perfect right and said if he said it he's got to take care of it right that's it amen oh of course we I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven if you're forgiven you're perfect cuz you ain't guilty right especially the way God says it come on remember this morning we're in in it remember this morning what according to a message called invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother run speaks of justification and that chopping off your pie sins can never be remembered again against you they're chopped off then he speaks of the how that that individual will come to a place that as though he never done it that's justification then he goes on to speak of an individual of justification he says the real you never did do it that's the real you is that baptism of the Holy Ghost that's inside of there it never did Sin when are we going to believe it well I just don't know that sounds good but I don't know well we've had 50 years now you got won't be long till I'll be dead if it keeps on going like it is now I ain't saying that not you know you got do that but I I am 76 years old you know 25 or 30 years I'm going to be at least getting to what do you say what to do right most of you done be P act right I told him at the fellowship meeting if it didn't happen pretty quick we going to have Fellowship meetings in the nursing home you know what we'd be in the nuring home wouldn't it be something sister C me and you sitting in there and you'd say what did he say Brother D I didn't hear it I he said something about some kind of dog or a cat or something I don't know silly ain't it but it's the truth time's running out right God has done all he can do and the emphasis I put on it all is God has got patience because he's patiently waiting on you and I 50 years he has given us to study this message and yet we know more about this out the other you know why that I don't and I'm not thr now listen you know why that I don't work on cars and things because I would have to TI my mind to learn to do those things and I won't do it I won't do it because it tight my mind it would Captivate me because then there would be nothing about that car that I wouldn't know Inside Out upside down in backwards if I was going to do it you see I want it to be where that he can speak to me and tell me and say well okay may I quote somebody that said this said the Lord told him that brother Dale is not saying that we're lost he's saying we're saved said you go tell him I said that that was good you can say well I believe this and but do you believe the rest of it said go tell him I said that said because he's kind of down and out the reason I'm down it out is because of trying to get you to believe the word that's already been given and I see you just drifting away and coming when you want to and back when you want to and doing what you want to and just things are falling apart I didn't do that when I was in the Baptist Church we have the greatest opportunity of all because when you miss you have an opportunity to go back and listen to the tapes and things but do you do you I don't understand brother Dale maybe you didn't hear the five Services before cuz hey man if you don't know the statute of a perfect man by now after 10 sermons of me reading it over he requires this he says this and we got to have this and these has got to be how many times have I said it in this P five six messages until it's almost a repeat sermon I don't mind it I'll repeat it again but think on these things let's stand together we've come to the communion part anybody has a need before we go into the communion we want no singing or nothing but if you have a need you want to be prayed for or anything before we go into the communion we always want to make sure and leave the the altar open to those things you know to where that that you can uh be prayed for if you want to I love him I I love him why because he first Lov me and P just my Sal e what about it father I pray that what we said Lord I know it's not nice and maybe said to way order be but I'm sorry I've tried anyway to listen to you and to express things and sometimes just
