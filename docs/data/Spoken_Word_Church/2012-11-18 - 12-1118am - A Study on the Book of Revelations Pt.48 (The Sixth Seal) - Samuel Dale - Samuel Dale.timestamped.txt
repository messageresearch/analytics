[5:05] it's your second or third or whatever
[5:07] some i know have been here before and we
[5:10] don't count your visitor
[5:11] we don't have anything around here to

[5:21] so just make yourself at home
[5:23] the lord would bless you and be with you

[5:29] morning
[5:30] that's that's good just sit a little
[5:33] closer together and make it closer
[5:34] fellowship
[5:35] we had a real good time at the
[5:36] fellowship meeting over
[5:38] in uh six flags there brother tony's
[5:42] yesterday
[5:43] and uh brother gerald hughes was our
[5:45] priest of goodness
[5:46] and we had a good time doing that amen
[5:49] you'll remember that now i want to make
[5:50] a an announcement that we'll make a
[5:53] couple of times
[5:55] and uh i hope you understand what i'm
[5:57] saying about it but
[5:59] our christmas time will be together on
[6:01] december the 9th
[6:03] and we always have that we have a dinner
[6:05] together
[6:06] everybody fixes and brings but we've had
[6:08] so much trouble trying to get the
[6:11] gifts that we give you to you until
[6:14] we've decided to make a new ruling to
[6:16] starting this year
[6:18] and from this year on it will be the
[6:19] ruling of this
[6:21] you've got to be present to get a gift
[6:25] all right and most of you know that it
[6:28] is a monetary gift that the church gives
[6:30] to you and appreciation
[6:32] and also we try to honor and appreciate
[6:35] all of our officers
[6:36] teachers you know musicians
[6:40] song leaders and thing and we try to
[6:42] give everybody
[6:43] and this year is going to cost us a
[6:45] pretty good bit because we started the
[6:46] thing years ago
[6:48] trying to give everybody in the offices
[6:50] a silver dollar
[6:52] well we started out when they were like
[6:53] two or three dollars a piece
[6:56] now they're 40 bucks you know and
[6:59] there's about 33 officers or offices in
[7:02] the church
[7:03] so you can calculate that it's going to
[7:05] be a pretty good little bit but that's
[7:06] not even the other part
[7:08] but you're going to have to be present
[7:09] to receive it and this is for the top
[7:12] players of the church
[7:13] not for somebody walking off the street
[7:16] and everything this is for the top
[7:17] players of the church
[7:19] you know and your immediate family
[7:21] that's under your household
[7:22] with your coming for the kids and things
[7:24] but now who is not here
[7:27] you know if you're not here your money
[7:30] will be placed
[7:31] in the missionary offering
[7:34] okay so you won't be losing you
[7:37] you're not here we try to come together
[7:40] to honor all the officers
[7:42] and offices and the people who help us
[7:44] here even down to the janitors and
[7:47] everything because we appreciate you you
[7:49] know because it's you
[7:50] and we appreciate also the the people
[7:53] coming to the church here so just
[7:54] remember that now
[7:55] if you're not present on that date your
[7:58] money will be put into a missionary fund
[8:01] to be given to the missionaries when
[8:03] they come by
[8:04] in the things but you must be present to
[8:07] win
[8:07] and you must be a top player
[8:11] and you know counting this your church
[8:13] home
[8:14] because that's what we can't we can't do
[8:16] the whole world
[8:18] you know but we can do a little bit in
[8:20] everything to help
[8:21] so i hope that's understood now and it
[8:23] will be announced
[8:25] um you know two or three more times
[8:26] until that time to do it
[8:28] okay all right if you got your scripture
[8:30] revelations 1
[8:32] and revelation 6
[8:35] and let's see this afternoon will be the
[8:39] communion
[8:40] and this coming saturday did we move the
[8:44] what did we do the next one will be
[8:48] kimbo get married yeah all right okay we
[8:50] got it because we had to change the
[8:51] bible study for
[8:53] a few weekends and different things so
[8:55] hard for me to keep up with
[8:56] all right revelations 1 and revelation
[8:59] 6.
[9:01] the heavenly father we thank you for all
[9:04] things
[9:05] thank you most of all for being you and
[9:08] we pray that you would just help us
[9:09] today that you'd come among us here
[9:11] could we gather for one purpose and that
[9:13] is to
[9:15] fellowship together around thy word and
[9:18] we pray that you would just
[9:19] have your way with each and every one of
[9:21] us should forgive our sins mostly
[9:24] and as you let your light shine in our
[9:26] hearts as we read your words you come
[9:28] and speak to our hearts and our lives
[9:30] forgive our sins keep us because that's
[9:33] our desire
[9:34] in jesus name amen
[9:38] okay we've been in a study on the book
[9:40] of revelations
[9:42] for quite a while so we always read
[9:44] revelations
[9:45] 1 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ
[9:49] which god gave unto him to show and to
[9:51] his servants
[9:52] things which must shortly come to vice
[9:55] and he sinned and signified it by his
[9:57] angel and to his servant john
[10:00] to bear record of the word of god and
[10:02] the testimony of jesus christ
[10:04] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[10:07] he that readeth
[10:08] and they that hear the words of this
[10:10] prophecy you keep those things which are
[10:12] written therein
[10:14] what or the time is at hand what it
[10:18] should be the time to understand right
[10:19] right
[10:20] the time is at hand right now
[10:23] revelations
[10:24] 6 verse 12
[10:28] and i beheld when he had opened the
[10:29] sixth seal and lo
[10:31] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[10:33] became black as sackcloths of hair
[10:35] and the moon became as blood and the
[10:38] stars of heaven fell
[10:40] into the earth even as a fig tree
[10:42] catches her untimely figs
[10:44] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[10:47] the heaven departed as a scroll when it
[10:48] had
[10:49] rolled together never mountain and
[10:51] island were moved out of their places
[10:53] and the kings of the earth and the great
[10:55] men and the rich men and the chief
[10:58] captains and the mighty men and every
[11:00] bondman and ever freeman
[11:02] hid themselves in the dens and in the
[11:05] rocks of the
[11:06] rocks of the mountains and set under the
[11:08] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[11:11] us from the face of him that set up on
[11:13] the throne
[11:14] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[11:17] great day of his wrath is come
[11:19] and who shall be able to stand and be
[11:22] seated lord that is
[11:24] blessing to the reading of the word now
[11:29] i know most of the
[11:32] most of the people back here are
[11:34] relation to brother bob
[11:36] and sister monica and we appreciate you
[11:39] coming being with us today
[11:41] and just make yourself to home if we say
[11:44] something you don't agree with
[11:46] just pray for us that's the best thing
[11:48] to do you know
[11:49] and then later come and sit down in the
[11:51] office and talk with me i'll be glad to
[11:53] to discuss whatever with you of what
[11:55] i've tried to say
[11:57] because we want to be right in the end
[11:59] time this is not a time to play around
[12:02] this is the time to understand as i said
[12:05] we've been in a study to the strangers
[12:07] today
[12:08] we've been in a study now for this is 48
[12:11] messages
[12:12] on the study on the book of revelations
[12:16] we've gotten up to the sixth seal and we
[12:18] just kind of covered a little bit along
[12:21] in there of the things that uh appears
[12:24] to us and
[12:25] sticks out to be covered not trying to
[12:28] re-preach them i did that in the
[12:30] in the years gone by in the 80s two and
[12:32] three
[12:33] and uh you know but to just pick up some
[12:37] thoughts
[12:38] and try to uh see what the lord is
[12:41] revealing to us in this day
[12:43] and where we're at because i believe
[12:45] that the message unfolds
[12:47] right i believe it it's the word
[12:50] progressive is a
[12:52] is a bad word i don't really think
[12:53] brother brown ever used the word
[12:55] progressive
[12:56] but we speak of progressive revelation
[12:58] and form of saying
[13:00] that it's unfolding but i like the word
[13:02] unfolding
[13:04] because you know uh
[13:07] irregardless i would think
[13:10] that if you're a believer in this
[13:12] message that you would agree with this
[13:14] statement
[13:15] that today the message has unfolded into
[13:18] greater depths
[13:20] than you know it was when we first began
[13:23] right and in that we don't look for
[13:25] another message
[13:27] nor a messenger to come to try to carry
[13:29] us on
[13:30] i believe rapture and faith lays in the
[13:33] books and the tapes
[13:34] the prophet's message i know and they're
[13:37] arguing around the country now about
[13:39] this that or the other
[13:40] brother around this away i believe
[13:41] brother adam was a human being
[13:44] all right and i believe he made human
[13:45] mistakes
[13:47] but the message is perfect amen
[13:51] i believe the message is perfect now i
[13:53] will not back down anywhere from that
[13:55] and i ask you to come and show me where
[13:57] the message is not perfect the message
[14:00] you say but now wait a minute you didn't
[14:02] mention there's one you got to be real
[14:04] careful there because you just made him
[14:05] deity
[14:08] right you didn't realize you've done
[14:09] that but that's what you've done see the
[14:11] messenger was a man a human being
[14:14] that was chosen of god to bring the
[14:16] message
[14:17] right he made human mistakes slips of
[14:19] the tongues
[14:21] and things like that because he was a
[14:23] human
[14:24] but yet the message he brought is
[14:26] perfect
[14:28] complete doesn't need anybody else
[14:30] doesn't need anybody to
[14:32] uh come along and
[14:36] tell you what he should have said right
[14:38] it just needs us to believe what he's
[14:40] saying
[14:41] right and that way then that's showing
[14:43] you where i stand
[14:45] in the whole line because uh it's like
[14:48] we're talking about
[14:50] what was the thing that we covered in
[14:52] the fifth seal
[14:54] on uh trying to get a better
[14:56] understanding
[14:59] there is no combat beast on the fifth
[15:02] seal
[15:04] do you have combat beasts for the first
[15:06] seal second seal third and fourth seal
[15:09] but on the fifth sixth and seventh
[15:11] there's not a combat beast
[15:13] all right the prophet said that's a
[15:14] great mystery
[15:16] it's a great understanding now
[15:20] i do not believe that the combat
[15:25] could break the seals right there was a
[15:28] lamb that broke the ceiling
[15:31] and then handed it to the combat beast
[15:35] and then the combat beast could announce
[15:38] so he's the announcer he's not the
[15:40] revealer
[15:41] even brother right i'm quoting said that
[15:44] jesus said my
[15:45] own life did not reveal that unto thee
[15:49] the father is the only revealer of the
[15:51] word
[15:52] see so then we don't put the emphasis
[15:54] upon the
[15:55] the messenger revealing the word we put
[15:58] the emphasis upon
[15:59] the lamb to break the seal and
[16:02] to reveal but then the announcing or the
[16:05] bringing to you and i
[16:08] we have to put that emphasis upon the
[16:10] prophet
[16:11] to come the because that would be
[16:15] you know that was promised in the word
[16:17] and i know it's elementary that we'll do
[16:19] this morning but
[16:20] uh you know i want you to think with me
[16:24] and just to see a point because there is
[16:27] no
[16:29] combat beast on this sixth seal right
[16:32] all right see because you don't need one
[16:38] there's two reasons for not needing one
[16:41] number one is the fourth combat beast
[16:44] was an eagle
[16:47] so you don't need anything after them
[16:49] that was god's prophet
[16:50] to bring us the message you agree that
[16:53] was where was to come
[16:54] so you don't need another one right we
[16:57] don't need somebody to come along and
[16:58] straighten this one out either
[17:00] no right you know we need to believe
[17:03] what he said
[17:04] and sometimes have to wait patiently
[17:07] until god will reveal what is being said
[17:11] i've studied on things for 20 years
[17:13] before i ever preach on it
[17:15] well because i didn't see it right
[17:18] that's the reason i didn't preach it
[17:20] no problem with that is it you know if i
[17:23] didn't understand it took me
[17:25] 16 years to learn to ride a bicycle
[17:31] i'm not joking
[17:35] but you know i can do it today because
[17:37] the immense burn together in your brain
[17:41] and then you won't forget might not be
[17:44] as good balance as i had
[17:46] but just a point to get you to think
[17:49] about
[17:50] see we need the revelation the prophet
[17:53] of god said we need revelation more than
[17:54] anything
[17:55] right amen but it's only by revelation
[17:58] do we have the word revealed
[18:01] i believe in the letter of the word
[18:05] but i believe the letter of the word the
[18:06] prophet said can be questioned
[18:09] is that true he said while it's laying
[18:12] here
[18:14] it can be questioned right
[18:18] but once it's revealed you can't be
[18:21] questioned that's right
[18:22] amen there was a day-man question
[18:25] about the joshua of faith
[18:30] he wondered about it he wondered whether
[18:32] his good deeds
[18:34] was it some people are special something
[18:38] you were
[18:40] but you know god revealed to a man one
[18:42] day the joy shall live by faith
[18:45] martin luther struck the world with a
[18:46] revelation
[18:49] don't tell him how many times he had
[18:50] preached on justification
[18:52] in his life but yet one day it was
[18:56] revealed
[18:56] that's what i'm talking about see this
[18:58] message then must be revealed
[19:01] not to just read the letter because paul
[19:04] said to let her kill it
[19:06] but the spirit giveth life now
[19:09] i hope with that you understand where i
[19:11] stand
[19:12] because we believe this message to be
[19:16] the last message to the gentiles all
[19:19] right
[19:19] and in being that then we must take what
[19:22] he says
[19:25] and like i said sometimes things that
[19:28] he'll say
[19:28] sounds a little contrary but i've never
[19:31] found it yet to be
[19:32] but if you give it a little time that's
[19:35] right and wait a little while and study
[19:37] a little while
[19:38] that it won't come out to give an
[19:39] understanding you know
[19:42] and i do not agree with the doctrine
[19:44] that says before the seals he
[19:46] didn't understand what he was doing but
[19:48] after the seal was broke
[19:50] he come into the great revelation i i
[19:52] know he came into the great revelation
[19:55] but he was a prophet amen all right
[19:58] you go back and show me where he missed
[20:00] it other than the white horse rider
[20:06] he said well he said this he said that
[20:07] yeah but just keep on reading i said a
[20:09] lot of things
[20:10] on reading that's my point but just get
[20:12] the point now there's no combat beast to
[20:14] announce this sixth seal
[20:18] because the fourth combat beast
[20:22] was the eagle all right the prophet
[20:26] the messenger all right now
[20:29] i know i've told you this and this is
[20:31] the way i believe it we take the first
[20:34] combat beast to be the
[20:36] the lion the next the hawks the man then
[20:38] the eagles
[20:40] and we say well the lion was you know
[20:44] was in all of the people we'll say the
[20:47] ox within all of the people
[20:49] will say that the man was in all of the
[20:52] people no luther wesley and all of those
[20:54] great men
[20:55] but when we come down to the end we say
[20:57] blood brown
[20:59] i agree he was the eagle
[21:03] but i thought he said we was to be
[21:06] little messiahs
[21:08] children of god we'll get into a point
[21:10] this morning and
[21:12] you know if you don't agree with it like
[21:13] i said fine just pray for us
[21:16] but i try to prove my point and then by
[21:19] moving on through
[21:20] to the message we can see you know more
[21:23] of it
[21:24] now we went through it and said the
[21:27] seals and what's the mystery in a minute
[21:29] where
[21:30] you know what brother brown said that
[21:31] that line didn't understand
[21:39] you could bring the last day message
[21:42] from the line
[21:44] the ox they had their time
[21:49] they said you had to wait till the eagle
[21:50] came
[21:53] that's not discrediting any of those is
[21:55] it
[21:56] right let's just tell it like it is
[22:01] it's the word of god all right now so
[22:04] get my point now
[22:06] the light the the lamb
[22:09] opens the seal because the bible says it
[22:13] and then the combat beast is the voice
[22:17] to announce
[22:19] or to proclaim what
[22:22] is said there and you know that's
[22:25] exactly
[22:26] the scriptural point that we believe
[22:30] right and you know like i said i wrote
[22:33] these notes down
[22:35] three or four days ago so you know
[22:38] you'll see that i'm just trying to
[22:39] follow a line up
[22:41] but go ahead and look at what we believe
[22:43] we believe in malachi 4.
[22:46] amen right we believe in an end-time
[22:49] prophet
[22:50] coming of malachi 4.
[22:53] all right and in doing that we know for
[22:56] a certainty that
[22:58] the word of god is true
[23:02] we know that it all points down to the
[23:04] end time
[23:07] but then he gets in verse 5 and says
[23:09] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[23:11] before they come in the great and
[23:13] dreadful day of the lord i like that
[23:15] i like that little word you
[23:18] you know that's me
[23:26] you remember sister meaty's when she
[23:28] asked about marrying brother brown
[23:29] behold i send you she wasn't worried
[23:32] about how many elijahs they were
[23:35] she wasn't concerned about all these
[23:37] coats of elijah's
[23:38] and all these people that claimed to be
[23:40] elijah she married one man
[23:42] and that was the one she wanted because
[23:44] it was sent to her
[23:46] all right now but behold i send you
[23:48] elijah the prophet
[23:50] before they come to the great and
[23:51] dreadful day of the lord and what will
[23:54] they do and they shall turn the hearts
[23:55] of the fathers
[23:57] to the children
[24:00] and the heart of the children
[24:04] now notice the point and he shall turn
[24:07] the heart it didn't say hearts
[24:09] there's only one heart to be turned man
[24:13] and that heart is the word translated
[24:15] soul correctly
[24:18] so translate the word into our soul
[24:21] co soul is what we've been talking about
[24:23] as the being of who you are
[24:28] your body will go to the grave if you
[24:31] die your spirit will go
[24:33] somewhere to god or whatever as the
[24:35] scripture said would go to god and gave
[24:37] it
[24:37] but your soul will live on so the soul
[24:40] of you is the real part of you
[24:43] it's your being it could be the word
[24:46] heart
[24:46] is translated soul because
[24:49] it's not the thumping gizzard you know
[24:52] the thing that pumps the blood
[24:55] it's not that heart right it's the heart
[24:58] of you
[24:59] the heart of a peach is the seed
[25:03] contained in that and it may not be in
[25:06] the middle
[25:08] right you know what i mean by peach or
[25:12] about an
[25:12] apple or whatever it's in the seed of
[25:14] that all right so the heart of man
[25:17] not hearts one heart
[25:20] is going to be turned what
[25:25] to the what heart of the fathers
[25:28] to the children luke 1 17 said john the
[25:31] baptist came
[25:33] to do that right do we know that he was
[25:35] the
[25:36] the third coming of elijah
[25:39] and he was to turn the hearts of the
[25:41] children you know
[25:43] the fathers to the children the old
[25:45] testament saints was to be turned to
[25:47] right jesus christ all right that was
[25:50] john's message
[25:52] all right but now we know that there's
[25:54] something else to happen because
[25:56] and is a conjunction meaning something
[25:58] is going to take place
[26:00] and the heart of their children to their
[26:02] fathers
[26:03] now i've talked with people and i'm sure
[26:05] you have
[26:06] and they said well john the baptist
[26:08] turned it we'll agree with that luke 1
[26:09] 17 they're going out of a verse or two
[26:12] and he said in the children of the
[26:13] disobedience of different things and
[26:15] they'll say see john turned him over
[26:17] this way it turned him back well the
[26:18] easiest thing to say to me is you don't
[26:21] realize what you just done
[26:22] because if john turned them to the
[26:25] message
[26:26] and then he turned them back he'd put
[26:28] him back under the law
[26:30] and see that wouldn't be correct right
[26:32] so then there has to be an end time to
[26:34] come
[26:36] into work that what in this end time
[26:39] we are to be turned back as we would
[26:42] call it to the faith of the fathers
[26:44] the revelation of the fathers lest he
[26:47] would come and smite the earth with a
[26:48] curse
[26:49] and we see a lot of that going on today
[26:52] i hope you
[26:53] you read the newspapers you can see a
[26:55] lot of things that's going on that we're
[26:57] under a
[26:58] pre-tribulation there's a prophet with
[27:02] cover not
[27:02] the great tribulation as we'll get into
[27:04] the sixth seal we're under a
[27:06] pre-tribulation
[27:07] of where things are taking place and you
[27:11] know what i love about the bible it is
[27:13] specific
[27:14] right when the bible would say
[27:20] that and seven thousand men
[27:23] died in an earthquake or something like
[27:25] that just a scripture
[27:29] what do you think well you know
[27:32] there's 200 000 killed over in that last
[27:35] one you know
[27:37] and why wouldn't they say 200 000
[27:38] because the bible
[27:40] and god is specific
[27:44] when he says there'll be seven thousand
[27:46] killed there's not seven thousand in one
[27:49] or neither is a six thousand nine
[27:52] hundred and ninety nine
[27:53] see he's making his point and that way
[27:57] you can take it and narrow it down
[27:59] and find that exact existence
[28:03] and say thank you we got it i mean
[28:07] it's like he said about the brother
[28:09] branham is it that
[28:10] you got your problem out here with man
[28:12] and all of that
[28:14] he said that's not necessarily just the
[28:16] sign of the end
[28:18] he said because they've always done that
[28:21] but when you put it all together and you
[28:24] come out to a place
[28:25] then you can see that we must be turned
[28:29] back to the revelation of the father
[28:34] the faith they had
[28:38] and and in turning back to that faith
[28:41] then we wouldn't be confused
[28:45] right all right
[28:48] we'd be standing in the scriptures
[28:52] that's why when brother random went
[28:53] beyond the curtain of time you remember
[28:54] what he said
[28:57] they said jesus will come to you and
[28:58] you'll be judged
[29:01] he said well i'll be judged in other
[29:03] words what i preach
[29:05] said will paul and peter and them be
[29:07] judged
[29:10] and the angel said yes
[29:13] he said well then i preached what they
[29:16] preached
[29:18] so in other words they make it i'm going
[29:20] to make it
[29:21] right that was his point i preach what
[29:24] they preach
[29:26] so then why would anybody come alone
[29:28] just saying a moment ago and said
[29:29] brother around was all confused
[29:31] in his early ministry and then the son
[29:32] of man finally comes straight in him out
[29:35] when you see those doctrine just keep
[29:37] watching the guy that's right
[29:38] the guy's gonna ride off somewhere and
[29:41] he's gonna get tied up with women he's
[29:42] gonna get tied up with garbage cans
[29:44] so let him run their course with you an
[29:47] hour to stay with the word
[29:49] all right look at the next one we talk
[29:50] about luke 17 30.
[29:55] in the day when the son of man would be
[29:58] revealed
[29:59] well there was no one down through time
[30:02] he even hardly spoke of
[30:04] son of man amen you go back in your
[30:08] writers and read it
[30:13] here comes a man little kentuckian out
[30:16] with about a seventh grade education
[30:20] and your scholars that are sitting there
[30:22] and
[30:24] none of their fancy writers dealt with
[30:26] son of man because
[30:28] you know i know some did to a degree but
[30:30] i mean as a basics they didn't follow
[30:32] son of man
[30:34] because they could barely understand the
[30:36] son of god
[30:38] so they didn't deal with son of man
[30:42] but here comes a prophet along any
[30:46] little kentucky language we start
[30:48] talking about son of man
[30:51] son of man and he deals with it
[30:54] all the way through his ministry
[30:58] and any climax has been talking about
[31:00] that
[31:03] jesus when he was here on earth
[31:06] that he never declared himself to be the
[31:08] son of god
[31:10] he declared himself to be the son of man
[31:13] now we know he did in the basis of
[31:15] discussing it with him and
[31:17] different things like we always say i
[31:19] try to be
[31:20] you know corrective not of brother
[31:22] around him but mine in your language
[31:24] an understanding but around said jesus
[31:27] never
[31:28] called mary his mother you remember that
[31:32] now there's no correction to the point
[31:35] but now when he was a little baby
[31:39] you know a six-month-old baby a
[31:41] eight-month-old baby
[31:43] he started saying mama yeah
[31:47] come on let's be human sensible
[31:50] the prophet is not saying that he never
[31:52] done it like that he's saying he never
[31:54] called her
[31:55] his earthly productor producer or bring
[32:00] her forth
[32:02] you know you would call her a woman
[32:05] because it just borrowed the wound to be
[32:07] borned in
[32:09] all right that way is not corrective
[32:11] that's understanding
[32:12] that should be progressing in us to
[32:16] where we can understand
[32:17] but see jesus he he would say who do the
[32:20] man say i the son of man now
[32:26] peter said the art the christ the son of
[32:29] the living god
[32:33] now immediately what would you say if
[32:36] you were saying
[32:38] like jesus was saying that who do man
[32:41] say i the son
[32:42] of man well i would probably correct him
[32:46] when you
[32:47] i would say hey look would you mind
[32:49] listening to what i'm saying
[32:51] i'm asking you the question the who does
[32:53] men say
[32:54] i the son of man i am
[32:58] but see instead of doing that what did
[33:00] jesus do
[33:03] he said
[33:08] upon this rock i'll build my church
[33:11] peter had it right about the son of god
[33:15] and jesus said i'll build my church all
[33:18] right run around what did he say he said
[33:20] he was
[33:21] dying son of man ray son of god down
[33:24] through seven church ages the son of god
[33:26] to appear in the end time again as son
[33:29] of man
[33:32] but not the lord jesus christ coming
[33:34] back
[33:35] in a corporal body you know immortal
[33:40] right but
[33:43] then he would come back in a prophet
[33:47] and have that same ministry
[33:50] in elijah that was promised to come in
[33:53] the end time the forthcoming of
[33:55] the the of elijah right this promised
[33:58] all right and in doing that he would
[34:02] bring forth the son of man
[34:06] because see son of man was dealing with
[34:09] god in human flesh
[34:12] and he was really dealing with the
[34:14] resurrection sign
[34:18] that's why they couldn't understand son
[34:19] of man when jesus constantly went
[34:22] through son of man son of man son of man
[34:24] but even the great apostle paul never
[34:27] even mentioned son of man
[34:30] none of you writers of peter james john
[34:33] now john does in his
[34:35] john writing because he's writing what
[34:36] jesus said
[34:38] but even after going to patmos and
[34:40] coming back and that
[34:41] no one in there mentioned son of man
[34:45] because that was to be with withholden
[34:47] according to luke 17 30
[34:49] in the day when the son of man would be
[34:51] revealed
[34:53] made known see here comes the prophet
[34:56] talking
[34:57] sort of man some name they're wondering
[35:00] what's this man talking about
[35:04] but then he began to do the discernments
[35:08] the things that the prophet
[35:11] the lord jesus christ had upon the earth
[35:14] he comes back with the same anointing
[35:17] style looking
[35:18] until they actually called him god
[35:22] and i'm not throwing off on them
[35:26] because if you lived around a guy you
[35:28] know day in and day out and every time
[35:30] he turned around like who was it trump
[35:32] uh one of the men said you know the man
[35:34] can tell you where a fish is
[35:36] at you know i mean if you went that way
[35:38] every day in and out with it
[35:40] you would have a lot of thinking about
[35:42] it
[35:44] but yet you got to define between the
[35:46] man
[35:47] and the god that was using the man so is
[35:50] that
[35:51] as god would use the man he said
[35:54] i'm nothing awaiting him but then all of
[35:58] the great signs that followed the lord
[36:00] jesus christ
[36:02] appears in this little man in the end
[36:05] time
[36:07] but there was one thing that was needful
[36:11] and that was why the son of man would
[36:13] have to deal with it
[36:16] as i said the son of man would be
[36:18] dealing with the word made flesh
[36:20] you agree with that statement i mean you
[36:22] don't have to agree with me i don't ask
[36:24] nobody to agree with
[36:25] i've always told you i don't ask my wife
[36:26] my kids are all here i don't ask them to
[36:28] agree with
[36:29] i ask them to check out what is being
[36:31] said right amen and then deceive
[36:33] if the spirit of god within them agrees
[36:35] with the word
[36:37] but he would come forth in the son of
[36:39] man because it was something about the
[36:40] son of man
[36:42] that was left off during as i said that
[36:44] times of understanding
[36:46] and i won't get into it today but we
[36:48] will get into it
[36:50] eventually you know that when you get
[36:52] old about matthew
[36:55] 24
[36:58] you find this son of man the lord jesus
[37:01] christ
[37:04] you know what he'd done we didn't know
[37:07] it because we had no idea no writers
[37:09] knew of it
[37:11] but he preached six seals right you that
[37:14] have been in the seal book you know what
[37:15] i'm talking about
[37:16] right jesus preached six seals
[37:20] the prophet took him and overlaid him
[37:22] and compared him
[37:24] see because he was the son of man
[37:28] amen and the son of man would deal with
[37:32] a bodily form
[37:36] it would have to be a a special
[37:40] point
[37:44] the brother said in
[37:48] body he was a man
[37:51] he said the spirit he was god said but
[37:53] in soul he was almighty god
[37:59] that was god made manifest right
[38:02] in the flesh right that wasn't a moral
[38:05] human being as some are teaching now
[38:07] the river jordan doctrines that they're
[38:10] teaching that jesus wasn't god until
[38:12] the river jordan then he finally become
[38:14] god well who was he before he could
[38:15] become god
[38:17] my bible said he was born lord to christ
[38:21] that's scripture all right
[38:25] i know that he was anointed on the river
[38:27] jordan to bring forth the ministry yes
[38:30] i know the prophet had to come to that
[38:31] position too
[38:33] to be anointed to bring those things or
[38:35] the seals and things
[38:37] but that doesn't mean he wasn't god
[38:39] that's right
[38:41] he was almighty god made manifest in
[38:44] human flesh
[38:46] the body was a man yes hebrews 10 5
[38:49] a body thou hast prepared me
[38:54] but in spirit and soul that was almighty
[38:56] god amen or else you got a second person
[38:59] that's right amen we know and deal with
[39:02] the fact that we know the second person
[39:03] won't matter
[39:05] but this man would be the word made
[39:07] flesh the son of man that's right
[39:10] and if he would be the son of man then
[39:14] no one would be able to understand him
[39:20] right but one day and he knew that he
[39:23] knew as it said a moment ago
[39:25] he knew he had to give his life
[39:29] he would have to come back in the form
[39:31] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:33] into the hearts of the saints on the day
[39:35] of pentecost
[39:37] and in doing that then they would have
[39:40] the ability
[39:43] to comprehend
[39:49] jesus would make the statement of like
[39:52] you don't understand what's going on
[39:56] i said one day you will that's right
[39:58] well then the odds that brought around
[39:59] gets over about the sixth
[40:01] seal and
[40:04] he makes an outstanding statement
[40:09] he said it's gone from you
[40:13] he said there's no way for you to
[40:14] understand
[40:16] is that all that jesus would speak that
[40:18] way that jesus would know the people was
[40:21] not understanding him
[40:24] he said i have to go away and get my
[40:26] life and come back and then
[40:28] you'll understand right after life's
[40:30] finally
[40:32] you know they get in close enough to it
[40:33] and he said do you finally believe
[40:36] have it have you finally got to the
[40:38] place you can believe what i'm doing
[40:43] because see in the end time we would
[40:44] have a man to come back to that ministry
[40:46] without to repeat
[40:49] and he would be able to stand here and
[40:51] declare the secrets of the hearts the
[40:53] different things that jesus would do
[40:56] that then he would preach the seals
[41:02] same as matthew 24
[41:05] and bring it down
[41:08] that's no coincidence i hope you would
[41:10] not think that
[41:13] and in doing that then the son of man
[41:15] would stand there
[41:18] and not only would he have all the gifts
[41:20] and the signs and the wonders
[41:23] that the dead would be raised the sick
[41:25] would be healed
[41:29] but yet he would declare
[41:33] the opening of the seals
[41:36] all right now move a little further with
[41:38] that if you will
[41:40] then that would mean that john was right
[41:44] when he was standing on the edge of the
[41:47] thing baptizing people
[41:50] and when jesus walked up what did he say
[41:58] he didn't say hey here comes god no what
[42:00] did he say
[42:02] behold the lamb of god
[42:08] that takes away the sin of the world
[42:12] see then watch when you get over into
[42:14] the opening of the seals
[42:15] why would you want to change from it
[42:17] being the same lamb
[42:23] that would open the seals it was the
[42:26] same lamb that spoke of them what would
[42:30] be any problem
[42:32] see that way you would not be looking to
[42:33] mankind
[42:36] you would be looking to god amen
[42:41] and as the prophet said about
[42:45] if god requires perfection that he's got
[42:48] to make a way
[42:52] and says he has
[42:55] by himself coming and living in you and
[42:58] i
[42:59] that's all right
[43:02] see he has to make a way so we have to
[43:04] make a way for us to understand
[43:06] so it would be left with us as to as a
[43:09] prophet would say
[43:10] it would not be left for us to just read
[43:12] the bible right
[43:14] that's well and good it would not be
[43:17] left
[43:17] all of the commentaries all the writings
[43:20] all of the new scriptures
[43:21] writings and the things to come along
[43:25] it wouldn't be left upon that for him to
[43:27] end this world
[43:29] it would be left upon the fact of
[43:30] whether or not
[43:34] he kept his word from malachi 4
[43:38] and would send us elijah the prophet
[43:42] and then it would come forth then that
[43:43] this elijah the prophet
[43:48] would be able to stand on earth and all
[43:50] of the gifts and the signs and the
[43:51] wonders that followed the ministry of
[43:53] jesus christ
[43:56] but really the only difference you have
[43:58] between the lord jesus christ is brother
[43:59] random is the bodily
[44:01] now you need that quote the bodily form
[44:04] is the difference because that bodily
[44:06] form was born from a mama
[44:08] and a daddy and was an earthly
[44:09] possession and a soul of an individual
[44:11] had to be born again
[44:14] you'd say well i don't know about that
[44:15] well he's the one that said he wasn't
[44:16] arguing with you
[44:18] he said it all right now
[44:21] so that made the difference between the
[44:23] two
[44:24] but as far as the ministry
[44:27] everything is identical because the lord
[44:31] jesus preached six seals
[44:33] right he'd have to preach himself
[44:36] because he wasn't
[44:38] you know if you followed that later on
[44:43] you didn't have to preach it because he
[44:44] was it he said a seven seal can't be
[44:47] it's a great secret but right around and
[44:49] said
[44:51] it can be ready
[44:55] now but see
[44:59] then we go over to another favorite
[45:01] scripture
[45:03] this is called revelations
[45:06] 10. we'll go ahead and pull that brother
[45:10] i'm just using these
[45:14] because maybe there's some among us
[45:16] today that doesn't understand these
[45:18] things
[45:20] and then especially out on the internet
[45:21] system where it's going
[45:23] there's a lot of people out there that
[45:24] don't understand maybe somebody click on
[45:26] today and see malachite four look
[45:27] seventy thirty revelations themselves
[45:29] first time they ever seen it say well
[45:31] that guy's got something i'm really
[45:32] checking today
[45:33] you know so we try to be for everybody
[45:39] but still i'm trying to be for everybody
[45:40] sometimes i'll find out a lot of things
[45:42] that
[45:42] i didn't know
[45:46] and it unfolds right until where we can
[45:49] see
[45:50] so look what it says in revelations 10
[45:53] we're very familiar with the writing
[45:56] we can go through a lot of things and
[45:57] explaining all of it
[46:00] like brother brown was the one that said
[46:02] in verse one
[46:04] the mighty angel come down from heaven
[46:06] close the cloud and the rainbow was on
[46:07] his head and faced with your son his
[46:08] fever covered fire
[46:11] he said that's the same as revelation 1
[46:13] 13 right
[46:16] i didn't say that he did revelation 1 13
[46:20] is one locker right in there 13 14
[46:25] one like unto the son of man
[46:28] it doesn't say in revelation that he's
[46:30] the son of man there chapter one it says
[46:32] one like
[46:34] that's bride form your prophet said
[46:35] because it's standing there with pouts
[46:38] feminish so you better get to realize
[46:41] where we're at
[46:45] amen because there's always got to be a
[46:47] message
[46:48] we'll get to it in a minute man but
[46:50] there's always got to be a people to
[46:52] receive that message
[46:55] if you didn't receive the message in the
[46:57] days of martin luther
[47:00] then you would be judged upon the basis
[47:02] of martin luther's message
[47:04] that's right when sanctification came
[47:07] forth with john wesley
[47:09] if you didn't proceed on the end of that
[47:10] and received the new birth of that age
[47:13] you would be judged right
[47:16] right right we have to follow it for the
[47:20] hour that we're in
[47:22] and go on with it all right let's go
[47:24] down to where we always get to
[47:27] verse 7.
[47:32] but in the days of the voice of the
[47:33] seventh angel
[47:35] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[47:37] of god should be finished as he had
[47:39] declared to his servants to prophets
[47:43] now if we're going to believe that
[47:49] has to be in connection with
[47:52] the elijah of the end time you know not
[47:56] he wasn't the person of elijah he was in
[47:59] the paris
[47:59] john was not the person of elijah he was
[48:01] in the spirit the power of elijah right
[48:03] or elijah calls us elijah right so it
[48:06] would be the spirit in the man
[48:08] all right but if we're going to believe
[48:10] that then there must be some connection
[48:13] to word that we can keep it within our
[48:16] understanding
[48:19] to see then if we believe
[48:22] as we'll get to in a second that this
[48:25] fourth combat beast
[48:28] would be the eagle
[48:33] be elijah do you think we've got to get
[48:37] that back to the seventh church age
[48:42] all right that's why your prophet was so
[48:46] perfect
[48:48] he said the bride goes up in revelation
[48:50] 4 1
[48:52] and not seen until 1921.
[49:00] right
[49:03] see then we go over to revelation 10 and
[49:05] we say but
[49:06] but what about this
[49:11] he then comes to a carnal mind of
[49:13] understanding
[49:14] right well the book of revelations is
[49:17] not in order
[49:20] it should be here it should be here not
[49:22] about if it needed to bend that
[49:26] the prophet would have told that's right
[49:30] right now do you know of any word that
[49:34] he told us it wasn't in order
[49:39] but i believe by memory i can quote a
[49:41] few things
[49:43] where he said even the the ends and the
[49:45] butts
[49:47] is in the correct place
[49:50] so we don't need to move around the
[49:52] bible you know
[49:53] pull this over here put that over here
[49:55] this would have been here
[49:57] well why didn't the prophet tell us that
[49:59] was what it was supposed to do
[50:00] he has plenty of time
[50:05] but he emphatically stated the bride
[50:07] goes up
[50:09] not seen until revelation 19 then goes
[50:12] hayward
[50:13] what about revelation 5 brother now what
[50:15] about revelation 5
[50:16] that's in heaven come on that's where
[50:18] your prophet said it was that
[50:20] he didn't say the bride wouldn't be seen
[50:22] the bride ain't seen on earth anymore
[50:25] revelation 4 1 to 19 21 but she's seen
[50:28] in heaven
[50:29] amen amen are we right
[50:33] you seen in heaven but not on earth
[50:37] he said 4 to 19 is jewish
[50:41] all right see then what are you gonna do
[50:44] with it with
[50:46] the great understanding that we try to
[50:48] proclaim from revelation 10
[50:52] 7.
[50:55] and then somebody picks up a book from
[50:57] the prophet and they read it and they
[50:58] say well
[50:59] he said here that drive goes up for one
[51:02] and not come back in 1921 so
[51:04] that can't be elijah come on
[51:09] they got a point right that's wrong
[51:12] they just trapped you whether you know
[51:14] it or not
[51:16] you're standing there with your mouth
[51:20] because they just exposed you
[51:26] but you see when you know the truth
[51:30] okay
[51:34] john
[51:37] what was you told to do
[51:43] let's go over there and then we'll come
[51:44] back to this okay bro
[51:48] let's go to revelation 1 then we'll come
[51:49] back to seven
[51:51] john what was you told to do
[51:56] saying i'm not going to make it the
[51:57] first in the last one god says
[51:59] write in a book and send it unto the
[52:02] seven
[52:02] churches which are in asia
[52:06] john was commanded to write these things
[52:09] and send it back to the church
[52:13] not just write one or two chapters
[52:16] but from chapter one as we would begin
[52:19] to see
[52:20] until chapter 21
[52:24] john was commanded to write it
[52:28] and send it back or send it
[52:33] to those seven ages the churches are
[52:35] named samaritan's pergamos
[52:37] tower of philadelphia sardis ladies
[52:42] don't you imagine john was getting
[52:44] confused
[52:46] a little bit when he got over there to
[52:50] 10-7
[52:54] and he talked about an angel standing on
[52:56] earth
[52:59] and he would talk about seven thunders
[53:02] under their voice
[53:07] now what would you do
[53:11] what would you do if you were commanded
[53:14] to write
[53:15] a letter to seven churches
[53:18] you know and tell them what you saw
[53:24] well i just write down what i saw
[53:28] i saw this i saw that i saw this i saw
[53:30] that
[53:31] that's what john done right
[53:34] you agree yes he wrote it exactly as he
[53:37] was told to write it
[53:43] go back up 10 70.
[53:46] there's always been a key there to me
[53:48] that really always helped me
[53:54] is why would john
[53:57] lee be time no longer
[54:03] why would he put that little word but
[54:10] what did you just say in the days of the
[54:12] voice of the seventh angel
[54:14] and then you would have had mass
[54:15] confusion because you'd had all these
[54:17] guys running around to be an all kind of
[54:19] elijah i'm this i'm there
[54:24] but remember john has done come through
[54:28] the church ages
[54:30] he knows there's only seven ages
[54:34] and whether you know it or not i'm
[54:36] quoting brother branham almost verbatim
[54:38] you that know the message you don't have
[54:40] to agree that's right
[54:42] so here comes the man that says well
[54:45] we'll write
[54:46] in this seventh church age would be the
[54:49] life's age and there he would start off
[54:53] and he would say the beginning of the
[54:54] creation of god
[54:58] and loving it so much here with a
[55:00] prophet come along and say
[55:02] he was the beginning of the creation and
[55:04] he said we're the rest of that creation
[55:07] i love that don't you amen that's right
[55:09] puts us in there
[55:11] because like i've always tried to tell
[55:13] you if you want to find yourself in the
[55:15] bible
[55:18] once you go to the book of revelation
[55:20] the book that we was told to stay away
[55:22] from
[55:23] right is a book written
[55:27] to and about the bride
[55:30] amen
[55:33] i ask you to come and show me any place
[55:36] in the book of revelation
[55:38] where jesus christ is shown by himself
[55:49] you quiet don't you i'm just asking you
[55:54] because i've studied over 40 something
[55:56] years and i've never found yet where
[55:58] jesus was there by himself the book of
[56:00] revelations is the bride's book
[56:04] the book we was told to be scared of why
[56:08] because that would be the devil trying
[56:11] to
[56:12] pervert us and turn us away that when
[56:14] the prophet would come and tell us the
[56:16] symbols
[56:17] yes
[56:20] then we can understand read revelations
[56:23] one and read what your prophet has to
[56:24] say
[56:25] one standing in the midst of the seven
[56:26] golden candlestick lock unto the son of
[56:28] man
[56:30] gerd about to pout for the golden girdle
[56:33] brother brown said he turned to see the
[56:35] voice
[56:36] and saw the bride well i believe it's
[56:38] why we're not a denomination but i'll
[56:40] give it to you out of service for your
[56:41] church but listen a little word
[56:46] button there's a very key word
[56:49] john is commissioned to write
[56:54] so he's writing
[56:58] but yet he begins to realize that i've
[56:59] advanced further over in and i'm talking
[57:02] of things that will happen
[57:03] after
[57:07] the church is gone you agreed a moment
[57:09] ago the prophet was right when he said
[57:11] we go up revelation 4 1
[57:13] and not single 1921.
[57:16] so john he said well what can i do
[57:23] i'm writing of things now that's going
[57:24] to take place after the rapture
[57:32] he says how can i do it lord
[57:35] and all that wants a key thing come into
[57:37] his mind
[57:40] your prophet said it it was necessary
[57:45] that the seventh church aids messenger
[57:49] be a prophet you agree with that
[57:52] statement right you don't you know i'll
[57:54] be glad to give it to you because
[57:55] i quote brother you believe it will come
[57:57] off of the computer
[57:59] you're not having any trouble with it
[58:00] because you have to realize it man
[58:03] he realizes it's the seventh church ace
[58:06] messenger
[58:08] would have to be a prophet because he
[58:10] would end up all things to the gentile
[58:12] dispensation
[58:14] and he would be able to tell us things
[58:16] to come after the dispensation
[58:18] over into the jews and the millennium
[58:21] and armageddons and
[58:23] all of the things and even to the future
[58:25] home what about a message we've received
[58:27] that goes all the way to tell us
[58:29] what the future home looks like
[58:36] but think john
[58:40] thinks how can i get this back to the
[58:43] church agency
[58:47] and then it strikes him and he says but
[58:49] in the days
[58:51] of the voice of the seventh angel
[58:57] the mysteries of god would be revealed
[59:00] to the seventh church age messenger
[59:03] right
[59:04] right the prophet of malachi 4
[59:08] luke 17 30 revelation 10 7.
[59:15] so the key is that little work but
[59:18] john sees then hey that messenger back
[59:21] there
[59:21] all i got to do is make sure i record it
[59:24] correctly
[59:26] he said one day almost a 2000 year
[59:30] period by the time he was writing to
[59:31] work
[59:32] coming back but said one day luke 17 30
[59:37] will come again a prophet will come
[59:42] in the end time
[59:46] that all of these mysteries can be
[59:49] revealed
[59:52] [Music]
[59:55] so he automatically looks back and sees
[59:57] the seven church age messenger as a
[59:59] prophet
[1:00:00] he just keeps on writing he said now i
[1:00:04] know how to get it back there i just
[1:00:06] record it
[1:00:10] and when i do in the days of the voice
[1:00:13] of the seventh angel
[1:00:16] remember he was commissioned to write it
[1:00:17] to the church
[1:00:24] knowing that if he wrote it down and
[1:00:26] realizing the seventh
[1:00:28] angel the messenger of the seventh
[1:00:30] church age that way your prophet
[1:00:32] explained it
[1:00:35] would be a prophet that the word of god
[1:00:38] could come true
[1:00:40] and all the mysteries could be revealed
[1:00:44] so he knew something was right then
[1:00:48] see this book that we're looking at
[1:00:53] could not be opened then until
[1:00:57] the seventh church age would come
[1:01:00] you agree with it this book was sealed
[1:01:03] daniel said it was
[1:01:05] the book of revelation said it was see
[1:01:07] it was seven seals and all this
[1:01:09] happening
[1:01:12] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:01:13] seventh angel the messenger of the
[1:01:15] seventh church age
[1:01:16] all the mysteries would be revealed
[1:01:22] okay agree that he was a prophet
[1:01:27] had to be that
[1:01:31] for the word of god to come to all right
[1:01:36] but just remember this
[1:01:40] you would also be left for the last days
[1:01:43] watch it in a minute we'll give the
[1:01:44] quote right around said
[1:01:48] there's a people a prophet in other
[1:01:51] words one to receive it
[1:01:53] to give it but there's got to be a
[1:01:55] people to receive it
[1:01:57] what's the use of bread around them
[1:01:58] coming if there's not a bribe
[1:02:06] if there's not a bride to receive what
[1:02:07] has been said why would the prophet say
[1:02:09] that's right that's where everybody says
[1:02:11] you'll stay away from the seals you
[1:02:12] don't understand
[1:02:13] why the prophet he told us what it was
[1:02:18] any problem
[1:02:21] you want to know what the first is he
[1:02:23] tells you
[1:02:27] he tells you the symbols right
[1:02:30] right a white horse rider
[1:02:34] next was a red horse those are telling
[1:02:36] you the position or situation of what
[1:02:38] was taking place
[1:02:40] but when he comes to the field when
[1:02:42] there was no combat beast
[1:02:48] see why because the fourth one would be
[1:02:50] equal and he could tell us what it is
[1:02:53] all right i know i keep repeating that
[1:02:55] but it's real good to read thee
[1:02:57] that's right
[1:03:01] see then it would have to be
[1:03:05] that this end time would depend upon
[1:03:07] whether god would keep his word
[1:03:10] and send the prophet but surely we know
[1:03:13] so we don't have to worry about it
[1:03:15] but you know what this is what i like
[1:03:18] the message or what i've stated a moment
[1:03:20] ago pull up number five
[1:03:23] there's got to be a people to receive a
[1:03:25] message but there'd not be a message
[1:03:28] that's right but we've got to get it in
[1:03:31] the correct order
[1:03:33] i want you to read what he says all
[1:03:35] right
[1:03:36] this is 1963 the fourth seal
[1:03:40] paragraph 105.
[1:03:44] no one else could do it lamb openers
[1:03:45] nobody's worthy
[1:03:47] the lamb opened the fourth seal and the
[1:03:49] fourth beast the living creature like an
[1:03:51] eagle said to john
[1:03:52] come see what the fourth mystery of the
[1:03:54] planet redemption has been hid in this
[1:03:56] book
[1:03:57] because the lamb was opening it in other
[1:03:59] words that's what he was saying
[1:04:01] there's a fourth mystery here i've
[1:04:03] showed you in symbol
[1:04:04] now john i don't know whether you
[1:04:06] understand it or not
[1:04:08] but he wrote down what he saw but it was
[1:04:11] a mystery
[1:04:12] so he wrote what he saw the lamb was
[1:04:14] breaking the seals
[1:04:16] and god still wasn't going to reveal it
[1:04:21] remember in the bible and the bible
[1:04:24] said this first seal was broke these
[1:04:28] people argued over the seals broke out
[1:04:31] sure like the brother said like not if
[1:04:33] you don't think they're broke i agree
[1:04:35] with you
[1:04:36] they ain't broke to you but don't say me
[1:04:38] ain't broke for somebody else
[1:04:41] just make your own statement ain't broke
[1:04:43] to me no they don't do that ain't broke
[1:04:45] nobody and when it breaks i'll tell you
[1:04:48] what it is
[1:04:49] now you've got that old white horse
[1:04:50] rider by the tail dangling along
[1:05:06] almighty god you might not like my
[1:05:10] attitudes with that thing but i don't
[1:05:11] mean it
[1:05:13] if you straighten brother round out if
[1:05:14] i'm straight around about then i have to
[1:05:16] be god himself
[1:05:19] i don't see why people would get upset
[1:05:20] with me doing it like that they don't
[1:05:22] like it because i frown
[1:05:23] but i'd like for you to get up here and
[1:05:25] say your brother tell me
[1:05:27] what you should say if you don't believe
[1:05:30] right around this prophecy
[1:05:32] brother said you'd make it too soft
[1:05:34] they'll thank you pulling something over
[1:05:35] on you believe that quote
[1:05:37] he said say it like it is right but look
[1:05:39] what he said
[1:05:41] the lamb broke the seal back there 2000
[1:05:43] years ago
[1:05:44] look the lamb was breaking the seals and
[1:05:47] god still wasn't going to reveal it
[1:05:50] it was left for the last days
[1:05:54] amen so under
[1:05:57] the line they couldn't understand
[1:06:01] under the ops they couldn't understand
[1:06:04] go to the next one
[1:06:07] program 119 to the fourth seal that was
[1:06:10] not mentioned of the other times of this
[1:06:13] writer
[1:06:14] i'm watching he's talking about the
[1:06:16] fourth combat beast called him death
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] none of the others called him death they
[1:06:21] called him this they called him that
[1:06:22] then he called him dead
[1:06:23] okay now he's mentioned that he's called
[1:06:26] out
[1:06:27] but uh under the revelation of the line
[1:06:29] no
[1:06:31] i want to read this closer i'd be sure
[1:06:34] it wrote down the place standing here
[1:06:38] under not under the revelation of the
[1:06:40] line
[1:06:42] or or the first age the early age
[1:06:45] it wasn't revealed the next age was the
[1:06:48] age of the ox
[1:06:50] which is the dark age of middle age it
[1:06:52] wasn't revealed
[1:06:53] that's what it was come on
[1:06:57] another man like beast of wisdom
[1:06:59] representing the reformers looked at
[1:07:00] western and so forth
[1:07:01] it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age
[1:07:05] the last age
[1:07:08] the prophetic age were there is to rise
[1:07:13] prophetic utterance see to whom the
[1:07:16] secrets
[1:07:17] always come you have to be a prophet
[1:07:22] with prophetic utterance
[1:07:26] right look the next one
[1:07:31] paragraph 145 the 70th week of daniel
[1:07:34] and we find out in this age there's the
[1:07:36] stars we have it there we have a
[1:07:38] star messenger we have a person we have
[1:07:40] a mission that goes we got a message it
[1:07:42] goes forth the eighth
[1:07:43] of people to reject it the people that
[1:07:45] received it
[1:07:48] the measure of this age was to come in
[1:07:49] the prayer of the lives of people to
[1:07:51] reject it
[1:07:52] for people to receive it that's been in
[1:07:54] that rage
[1:07:55] but it couldn't be comprehended
[1:07:58] down in the ages of the ox the line
[1:08:02] the man even though there were great
[1:08:06] combat beasts
[1:08:08] he was waiting to the end time
[1:08:12] but not only would there be a prophet
[1:08:13] there's got to be a prophetic people
[1:08:16] to receive that prophet okay
[1:08:20] go ahead to the next one number eight
[1:08:23] if you need it this is all the questions
[1:08:24] and answers in 60
[1:08:26] 3 which is on the seals that's really
[1:08:29] page 464
[1:08:31] of the old seal book if you need that
[1:08:34] all right
[1:08:35] boys what it says you see he's one of
[1:08:37] those ages only taking the deal
[1:08:39] into the holy spirit justification is
[1:08:41] the work of the holy spirit
[1:08:42] sanctification is the work of the holy
[1:08:44] spirit
[1:08:44] but the baptism is the holy spirit and
[1:08:46] watch it
[1:08:48] that's the reason it took a prophetic
[1:08:50] prophet to come down that's right
[1:08:52] you say brother brown you better hold
[1:08:54] your point and read the rest of us
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:00] come on that's the reason it took a
[1:09:02] prophetic prophet to come down
[1:09:07] no messenger to the age
[1:09:12] come on because the holy ghost came
[1:09:14] himself
[1:09:15] in the fullness of the baptism
[1:09:20] you're not gonna like this but if that
[1:09:23] ain't a zeus or street where are you
[1:09:25] gonna put it
[1:09:28] that's what he said
[1:09:32] that holy ghost he came on the day of
[1:09:33] azusa street
[1:09:35] was the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:09:37] prophet said just exactly like the book
[1:09:40] of acts
[1:09:41] you need those quotes
[1:09:47] you say well how can you say that would
[1:09:48] be a zeus tree because of what he just
[1:09:51] said
[1:09:51] that's right but at the end of the age
[1:09:55] as it always ends up on the others we
[1:09:57] find our then
[1:09:59] the messenger sent
[1:10:03] and all these scripts and things are to
[1:10:05] be placed in their places
[1:10:08] like that then the rapture comes for the
[1:10:10] church
[1:10:13] you see there's what i said a moment ago
[1:10:16] the lion is okay in everybody the ox is
[1:10:18] okay in everybody
[1:10:20] the man is okay in everybody but when
[1:10:22] you come down to the eagle there's only
[1:10:23] one eagle
[1:10:24] hey man i agree we
[1:10:28] but what about the little eaglets that's
[1:10:30] right right to feed up on the message
[1:10:35] what do you think we're doing here 40
[1:10:36] something years after the prophet's gone
[1:10:38] right
[1:10:39] we're supposed to be eating the message
[1:10:41] come on right
[1:10:44] man but it's got tied up in the man's
[1:10:46] ideas until they don't understand
[1:10:48] but you read that quote no messenger to
[1:10:51] the age will let you
[1:10:52] see them you say well wait a minute
[1:10:54] brother dale there's one black man
[1:10:56] black man one eyed out there i was i
[1:10:58] know the quote
[1:10:59] yeah i know this one too
[1:11:04] you can't put that black man in the ages
[1:11:06] and come down cause you're gonna do fun
[1:11:12] see there's no messenger come to azusa
[1:11:14] street the holy ghost came and said
[1:11:17] the prophet right
[1:11:21] we just read before then that prophetic
[1:11:22] people would have to be here
[1:11:24] a prophetic utterance yes
[1:11:28] what is it now
[1:11:31] my brother javelin was the street people
[1:11:32] was all goofed up
[1:11:37] so were you and i do we heard the
[1:11:39] message
[1:11:41] crow all you want to
[1:11:45] and even after 40 years of hearing the
[1:11:47] prophet's message
[1:11:49] look at the scriptures in this message
[1:11:51] two lords two souls under mercy perusing
[1:11:55] how many more you wanted to name
[1:11:59] you we're not calling ain't called about
[1:12:00] his name i call doctrine
[1:12:06] but you see we can wind up with a
[1:12:08] daylight out of luna just as easy
[1:12:15] i hope you understand that point right
[1:12:17] here
[1:12:18] there's not but one messenger and that
[1:12:20] was the prophet he brought it
[1:12:22] but he brought a wonderful message if
[1:12:25] you and i would just believe it
[1:12:26] right and let god reveal it
[1:12:30] great man stood right here in this
[1:12:31] church i had already corrected him down
[1:12:33] at the schoolhouse at guilds
[1:12:34] when he stood up down there and
[1:12:36] emphatically stated he said that luther
[1:12:38] was false wesley was false and pentecost
[1:12:40] was false
[1:12:44] i stood down there in front of him and
[1:12:45] told him i said brother and gave him the
[1:12:47] quote to page number we're brought
[1:12:48] around and
[1:12:49] that jesus street the word luther had
[1:12:51] the holy ghost wesley had the holy ghost
[1:12:52] and on the zeus street was the baptism
[1:12:54] of the holy ghost right around said just
[1:12:56] like the book of acts
[1:12:58] he said i met people 50 years ago that
[1:13:00] had the same holy ghost
[1:13:02] they come with a death pentecost a man
[1:13:05] came right here
[1:13:07] and restated that statement from this
[1:13:10] pulpit
[1:13:13] i wasn't the pastor because i would have
[1:13:15] been glad who got it behind him
[1:13:17] but you know what that man is dead and
[1:13:20] going on
[1:13:24] but everybody said he couldn't preach
[1:13:26] error
[1:13:29] you do what you want to about
[1:13:33] i approached him about it but he
[1:13:34] wouldn't correct it
[1:13:39] if i can tell you what brother ryan says
[1:13:40] and you won't correct and you're against
[1:13:41] him you're against me
[1:13:43] no problem with me i don't care whether
[1:13:44] you believe me or not
[1:13:46] i don't have anything to do with it it's
[1:13:48] whether or not you believe jesus christ
[1:13:50] lives
[1:13:50] right if he can't keep his message
[1:13:52] straight then there is no god right
[1:13:54] right what's the matter with us all
[1:13:56] right amen
[1:13:58] we see that luther wesley and azusa
[1:14:01] street
[1:14:02] brought back that prophetic people
[1:14:05] of prophetic people a prophet said right
[1:14:08] going down to number nine and i'll try
[1:14:10] to quit
[1:14:14] look what he says in 1964 305 persevere
[1:14:17] paragraph 269 you talk about the
[1:14:19] headstone it takes the whole building
[1:14:21] with it
[1:14:21] which is the church all of them will
[1:14:23] raise up come back from this first
[1:14:25] watch on to the seventh and all going to
[1:14:28] rapture
[1:14:29] each one had their day allotted to them
[1:14:32] and they had their reformers and
[1:14:34] founders
[1:14:35] and so forth all down through and this
[1:14:37] last age
[1:14:39] it come into an eagle again
[1:14:43] which is back in the prophetic age
[1:14:46] to bring this together
[1:14:49] right the prophetic age
[1:14:53] 1906 azusa street the holy ghost came in
[1:14:56] his fullness
[1:14:57] what he said i just can't see
[1:15:01] i don't give a who what you can't see
[1:15:03] it's what he said
[1:15:07] i can't see how a brown cow eats green
[1:15:10] grass and gives white milk
[1:15:13] can you well i don't quit drinking the
[1:15:16] milk
[1:15:18] but i found out the white cow gives
[1:15:20] white milk
[1:15:21] i've never found a chocolate cow to give
[1:15:23] chocolate milk to you
[1:15:28] let's see church for prophetic people
[1:15:33] to receive a message for people to
[1:15:35] reject it yes
[1:15:36] but of people to receive it
[1:15:43] because my people are doing this at the
[1:15:44] other in the end i'm trying to figure
[1:15:46] out something
[1:15:46] why why can't we stay in the message
[1:15:49] that's right why do we have to figure
[1:15:53] things out
[1:15:55] you better believe you get it figured
[1:15:56] out you got it wrong
[1:16:00] right get a good medical book about a
[1:16:02] hundred years ago
[1:16:05] the boy's sick this week
[1:16:08] you go to the doctor okay you're sick
[1:16:11] pluck a couple of toenails out and bleed
[1:16:13] him a pot of blood
[1:16:16] right and he's so weak he can't stand it
[1:16:22] but that's what they thought
[1:16:26] you understand what i'm saying what we
[1:16:27] thought down through time what mama
[1:16:29] taught
[1:16:30] us come on
[1:16:34] is okay for a time that's right but now
[1:16:38] it's time to believe the truth man
[1:16:39] the prophet said mama taught me about
[1:16:42] heaven
[1:16:43] and things he said it wasn't the way i
[1:16:45] saw it when i went back
[1:16:50] because nobody had been there i can't
[1:16:52] tell you what it is
[1:16:54] right but you see that's the way it is
[1:16:57] with this message if it's not revealed
[1:16:58] that's right amen that's why we had to
[1:17:01] have
[1:17:02] this one to come the son of man the lord
[1:17:04] jesus christ to come back
[1:17:06] in a man
[1:17:09] and declare a message that he'd already
[1:17:12] put in matthew 24.
[1:17:16] all right we had to declare it unto you
[1:17:20] but we got to become that amen what the
[1:17:23] prophet saying
[1:17:24] easter seal you become the word as you
[1:17:27] receive the word
[1:17:30] well i've read this i've read that right
[1:17:32] too many times
[1:17:36] let's read it one more time amen amen
[1:17:39] and let god speak right
[1:17:42] let him tell us the truth right we don't
[1:17:45] need somebody to straighten out this
[1:17:46] message right that's right
[1:17:47] amen the message is correct
[1:17:53] but you see
[1:17:56] we want to be big eyes and
[1:18:00] like i told someone the other day we
[1:18:01] were on our way back from the ministers
[1:18:03] meeting
[1:18:05] they gave them an illustration
[1:18:09] you know if you tear down a man's
[1:18:11] doctrine
[1:18:12] you kill him oh my god that's right
[1:18:17] around said i'm not here you remember
[1:18:19] this quote and i'm not here to preach
[1:18:20] doctrine
[1:18:21] somebody said he said i'm here to
[1:18:23] straighten out doctrine
[1:18:27] you need that quote he said i'm here to
[1:18:29] straighten it out
[1:18:31] he didn't preach a doctrine sure the
[1:18:33] bible is a doctrine
[1:18:35] church without a doctor and not a church
[1:18:37] right amen
[1:18:43] you start talking to somebody about
[1:18:45] water baptism or one god
[1:18:47] and what's the first thing they say
[1:18:51] you mean my mama wouldn't say
[1:18:54] come on how many of you done that talk
[1:18:57] to somebody and they'll come up with
[1:18:58] some form you know
[1:18:59] you mean my daddy my my brother or my
[1:19:02] you know what say you ain't said a thing
[1:19:04] about nobody being saved
[1:19:06] what you've done you exposed it
[1:19:10] why is it a catholic always a catholic
[1:19:15] because they're taught right over and
[1:19:22] they realize if they get away from it
[1:19:25] they believe they're lost
[1:19:29] there was a day when i faced that in a
[1:19:31] baptist church at 23 years of age a
[1:19:33] deeper than a baptist church
[1:19:34] teaching the sunday school class of the
[1:19:36] deacons and elders everybody
[1:19:40] and a man he lowered the moon on me
[1:19:45] he said what do you believe i said i
[1:19:47] believe god in three persons blessed
[1:19:48] trinity
[1:19:49] man this doctrine is one god but it's
[1:19:51] god free person
[1:19:53] he said you're trinitarian as anybody
[1:19:54] else you should call it a person a
[1:19:56] personality personality is an individual
[1:19:58] individual person
[1:19:59] you're just as trinity as anybody it
[1:20:01] didn't take me six months i didn't have
[1:20:03] to argue with him
[1:20:04] i looked back in his face and said i
[1:20:05] don't believe that anymore
[1:20:07] why because he had me nailed to the wall
[1:20:09] and i knew it
[1:20:10] but that's where most people don't even
[1:20:12] know when they're nailed to the wall
[1:20:13] they don't realize it i'm quoting
[1:20:15] brother brown what he said and they
[1:20:16] thought well he just don't know what him
[1:20:18] he want to quote this quote will bring
[1:20:19] it to me
[1:20:22] i'll be glad to read it because he all
[1:20:25] got to fit together
[1:20:26] amen if he was a prophet if he wouldn't
[1:20:29] a prophet
[1:20:30] let's eat drink and be murray because
[1:20:33] they're gonna be alone we're gonna die
[1:20:35] that's right you see i believe there's a
[1:20:38] people to reject the message potato
[1:20:40] people are receiving the message
[1:20:44] you and i have the opportunity to
[1:20:45] receive the message
[1:20:47] read it and study it
[1:20:53] and one day in the middle of the night
[1:20:54] trump will speak to you
[1:20:57] and you'll say thank you lord amen amen
[1:21:00] never seen that before amen so sweet
[1:21:04] and so gracious he is to us he don't
[1:21:06] slap us down and knock us around
[1:21:09] he lets us grow a little while then he
[1:21:12] comes by and visits us
[1:21:19] what about the church what about it
[1:21:26] we've had a profit he's in the word
[1:21:30] amen all right now let's believe what he
[1:21:32] said
[1:21:34] let's accept what he's saying even
[1:21:38] though it's contrary
[1:21:42] a lot of times what we think
[1:21:50] you know for profit says it we're
[1:21:51] supposed to believe it
[1:21:54] right
[1:21:57] even though it won't stay at some time
[1:22:01] what we think
[1:22:06] just been through with some brothers on
[1:22:07] daniel 70 we around emphatically states
[1:22:10] in daniel 70 weeks that jesus wrote into
[1:22:12] jerusalem on palm sunday april the
[1:22:14] second 1830.
[1:22:17] no no brother 33.
[1:22:22] my brown didn't say that no
[1:22:26] then it goes over the questions and
[1:22:27] answers on the seals
[1:22:29] you remember the three questions that
[1:22:31] was asked he said this took place
[1:22:34] april 4th
[1:22:38] a.d 30. you check your time's receiving
[1:22:42] right
[1:22:43] palm sunday was the one in daniel 70
[1:22:45] weeks where he said it
[1:22:47] april before april the 2nd that would
[1:22:50] have been on sunday
[1:22:55] monday tuesday would have been the
[1:22:56] fourth the run set on tuesday
[1:22:59] april 4th 80 30.
[1:23:06] i don't fit i don't care
[1:23:10] because see you're looking at it one way
[1:23:13] the prophet's looking at it another way
[1:23:16] jesus was born for b.c
[1:23:20] but our calendar puts in born one
[1:23:26] right and you know we can prove it by
[1:23:28] history
[1:23:29] they don't know why the man done that
[1:23:31] because he knew jesus was born before
[1:23:33] b.c
[1:23:34] short-term history would you think they
[1:23:36] were going to believe
[1:23:38] no they're going to still try to make it
[1:23:39] 80-33
[1:23:42] well i didn't say it around him amen
[1:23:47] see 80 33 would have been ad30
[1:23:52] if they had put the calendar back where
[1:23:54] it was supposed to be
[1:23:55] before bc and started it with one
[1:23:59] it would have been exactly
[1:24:00] mathematically and your profit was
[1:24:02] exactly right amen
[1:24:04] you said well i got a quote where he
[1:24:05] said 33 amen and i just
[1:24:07] got to explain that 1833
[1:24:10] is 1830 is what calendar you're looking
[1:24:14] at
[1:24:17] see this is one of those the things that
[1:24:20] seem hard to understand
[1:24:21] if we wait a little while
[1:24:25] they will come forth in the correct way
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] what would that break 360 inspirable 360
[1:24:31] and a sperm
[1:24:32] you might have a need than me
[1:24:44] that is
[1:25:07] one of them has a problem that is
[1:25:09] bleeding or like a problem develops on
[1:25:11] the knee and
[1:25:12] they keep operating it doesn't work
[1:25:15] that's what we want to be praying for
[1:25:16] she's standing for somebody else and
[1:25:18] then the other one
