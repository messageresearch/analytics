========================================

i'm certainly looking forward to what the lord has in store for us this morning or today and uh y'all just just pull on the gift um and and you'll get what you have need of because there's a promise that if we have a question he'll put somebody in the poop of a dancer so this morning um i just wanted to kind of run through uh we'll just pull up hebrews chapter seven and we'll just kind of continue studying that um maybe without so much slides and and whatnot but i'll just kind of talk through some things but um let's let's just go to the lord in prayer before we get into this we're so grateful to be able to gather together lord god and i pray lord that you'll just bless our study as we unpack these scriptures lord jesus and you'll open it up lord that it'll be profitable to us lord it will you'll give us understanding lord and just bless brother william as he's back there studying and preparing lord and prepare our hearts lord as we step through the scriptures lord that will be that that the ground will be good and tilled up and ready lord to receive what you have in store for us today granted lord in your name amen so so just to kind of you know the theme of hebrews is is that really what paul's trying to set for us to understand is that perfection perfection could not come by the law so he's trying to set set the stage for us that perfection perfect perfection in other words uh where where you match up with what god thought of you before the foundation of the world and you're you're living the life because the life of christ is in you that kind of perfection comes by this man melchizedek that came and visited abraham and the old testament was a law it was the old testament was a shadow of all these things that now you can see come to in fruition in reality in the new testament which is what paul says in hebrews chapter 10 he says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the the comers there unto perfect so the law is something that you could look at and compare your life with and but yet to be to achieve perfection requires a sacrifice to be made and the life of christ to come and live in you and so if we just take a little background to as paul is leading up to this point and that we get to in hebrews chapter seven let's just let's just do a little background and remember what he said in hebrews one and two and three and four on and on so i'm just going to run quickly through those uh some some points so in hebrews chapter one he said god hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son and in verse three he said who bring the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the majesty on high see he's building up his case to this this one this melchizedek this one this logos that talk to abraham is the is the very image the brightness of his glory and he's building building up this case so that he can present it to us that you ain't going to get perfection perfection by the law you're not going to get perfected by your works but only by this man that came and visited abraham but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should takes death for every man he's the one that's going to perfect us because he can he he paid the price for us that we look to what he did not to our own works for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings the captain of their salvation i i love that story that brother brown was just telling talking about about the the captain is the one that shows you how it's done that paul talked about how he's the forerunner that that came down and lived the life and went through all the things went beyond the veil and did all these things first just like that man that ran up the ladder in that store that run around was telling about that for the captain runs up the ladder and sprays out the fire and says come on boys you can do it and jesus did all this he's the captain of our salvation he he's the one that went first and showed us how to do it and then you follow behind him with that same power and that same life in you because he he was our forerunner in hebrews chapter 3 says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly call and consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus so paul's starting he's starting to lay in that foundation that he's our high priest who was faithful to them that appointed him as also moses with faith was faithful in all his house harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness don't harden your heart against this this against this fact that christ is the one that makes you perfect you're not perfect perfected by by by doing trying trying to do something in your own self but when you when you when christ is in your living then that's that's the evidence of your perfection so in hebrews chapter four he said there remaineth there for a rest there's a rest when christ comes and steps in and lives in you and you're you're not resting on what you're doing and resting upon your own interpretation but you're resting upon the word and on the finished work that christ did for you for he that has entered into his wrist he has uh he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his you're not doing something on your own works anymore but now is christ living in you christ is the one that's changing your thinking and making you want to come to church and making you want to read the bible because you're thinking and your thoughts everything your whole being has changed because now christ is living in you let us labor therefore to enter into that rest going through sanctification going through that all those stages laboring to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god how are you gonna how are you gonna come to that rest for the word the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit so in verse 14 of hebrews 4 paul says seeing then that we have a great high priest we got i see he's laying that foundation bringing it up to melchizedek who is who is a king and a priest combining those two aspects together see and then we've got a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not in high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace so we got something to be bold about we got something to have confidence in that we've got an advocate that went through the same things that we're going through that was tempted like we are but yet overcame he was the captain that went first to prove that it could be done let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need and in hebrews chapter five for every high priest taken from among men is what is ordained for men a high priest is to help you is ordained for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect let's let's pause on that for a second being made perfect what what does that mean you think about jesus going through all the the uh being born in a manger and growing up and coming to a place until finally he was there at the river jordan and and god could look down on him and say well now he's matched up with the thought where i thought of before the foundation of the world where he would be when he's ready to enter into his ministry so see god when when your per god wants to bring you to a place where you're matching up with his thought of you being made perfect perfection comes from where where god can finally positionally place you that matches up with god's thought of you before the foundation of the world and then you're then you're then you're perfect you're in a place where you're you're matching up with his thoughts being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him because he was made perfect because he came to that place that matched up with god's thought of him then you can come to that place where you match up with god's thought of you he was called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek and paul said of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing they need to go on to kind of give them a a a rough up about how you you're supposed to be able to teach others and you're supposed to be able to eat meat and all these kind of things i've got a lot more things to say about melchizedek but i can't quite do it yet but then you get over in hebrews 7 and he starts laying it out melchizedek really i think what he's saying there in hebrews chapter 5 is that melchizedek is is kind of a deep subject matter because it's getting into the foreknowledge of god it's getting into the the godhead it's getting into that god thought that you were part of god that life that's in you now by the new birth is part of you now that that the same way that that levi paid tithing or abraham because he was in abraham waiting to be manifested abraham could one day fellowship with him well well same way you were in christ and god wanted to fellowship with you and and wanted a way to express himself to you so so let's go back to the theme the theme of the whole book of hebrews is that the law having a shadow of good things to come the law is a shadow of something and you've got to be perfected that the only way that you can be perfected by is by christ colossians chapter 2 verse 16 says let no man therefore judge you in meter and drink or in a respective and holy day or of the new boon or the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ so christ is the central theme of everything jesus is everything he's our high priest he's our king he's our rest that's what paul is talking about he's our arrest he's our atonement he's our god he's that melchizedek that came to talk to abraham he's the logos if you're part of him he's that one body that we're all part of that one theophany that you're part of that you're baptized into that one body by one spirit by one by one faith one baptism all those things that's what colossians is saying here in verse 17 which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ and the body is talking about is you see when you when you when you hold your hand up to a light you cast a shadow but if you bring it closer and closer then eventually you'll see the body the body is the thing that's cast in the shadow so in the new testament we see the body so let's go in hebrews chapter six just continue along with a little background leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection unto go on unto that life go on unto where you receive that same logos that was back there before the foundation of the world and then verse 9 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we though speak in verse 17 god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his cow what what promise the promise of the holy ghost the promise of life the promise in psalms that i'm going to give i'm going to send a pre a high priest after the order of melchizedek the immutability of his council confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil what what kind of veil the veil of your flesh that he had entered in on the day of pentecost into your into your flesh to sit down on the throne of your heart whether the forerunner is for us entered in verse 20 even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek and paul will go on at the end of this chapter in verse seven if you could pull that back up there and just just leave that up there as we meditate on these scriptures paul paul paul's making a case that that the law is going to be the covenant is going to be changed and when you change when you change the priesthood the the covenant is going to be changed and so we get into all those things and what those things mean there's going to be a new covenant made a new covenant not not a covenant where you're trying to do something by works but a covenant where god is living in you that his life is living in you and he's going to do it an unconditional covenant that when you've got god sit it down seated on your the throne of your heart he's going to make it he's going to take you to the end regardless of of all the other circumstances regardless of everything else so so let's let's let's do a little bit more background let's just just to think about the setting of melchizedek coming to sit and talk to abraham now you go all the way back to the garden of eden god created a garden where heaven and earth heaven and earth could be one you've got a perfect little situation there and he plays man in the garden so that man and god could work together as one and we'll say almost like adam and eve were like were like priests because they knew they knew what god wanted and they were in harmony with god and everything was working together and evil is the seed if an adam and eve were expelled from the garden but god promised he promised that there was going to be a comet coming a seed that was going to patch things back together that was going to restore that harmony and and all down through the scripture you can see that that promise was of a combination priest and a king a king and a priest that was going to come and so you're looking all that as you read the scripture you're looking for this man that's going to be a priest and a king coming and he's gonna this priest king is gonna restore humanity back to the to the f from their fallen position to where at the back where they're they're priests again and even the bible you got that promise in the bible that you're you're you're you're we're priests and we're kings because he's restoring us back to because we're part of that same body we also have a role to play in that right so after the after the wreckage of the flood god chose a couple he chose a abraham and sarah out of the land of canaan and he promised them he made a promise that it's like a shadow of the new birth he promised them a huge family that that they a and he promised them all these blessings that they had lost in eden he promised them that land he promised him the covenant blessing and abraham didn't see all those promises but one day there's going to be a people that will see the restoration of everything that was promised to abraham and sarah so from from abraham and sarah all these all the blessings of god from this one little group this this one little cup all these blessings would flow out to every nation on earth and you think see how that's a shadow that that promise of the blessing that from one that one little family the blessings of god would flow from every to every nation on earth that's a shadow of how the new birth the promise of the new birth would flow out to every nation on earth and you can see that from from that just that one little event on the day of pentecost the gospel went all around the world and it's flowing like a like a river i'll give you wellsprings of everlasting life and it flows from one person to another all around the world so so now we've got this picture in mind that we're looking for a priest and a king and that priest king shows up there when he walks up to abraham when abraham is returning from the slaughter of the kings how how was a little man with with 318 guerilla fighters how are they going to go up against imperial soldiers from like four or five different kingdoms so that's what melchizedek says he says uh i i i'm gonna we're gonna eat bread and wine together and and and we're gonna worship this god that that delivered you your little 318 guerrilla fighters from from all of these all these kings that you were fighting right and so mel abraham met abraham melchizedek passing by passing by this little city named salem and and of course we know that's jerusalem and he meets this figure melchizedek who reminds us of this promised royal royal priest and a king both of these things together isn't that odd so in genesis 14 we'll read it says and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheddar leomar and of the kings that were with him at the valley of chavez which is the kings dale and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god he brought forth bread and wine now now you know one thing the holy ghost does it connects the dots so i want to connect the dots if i don't i'm not going to get to it today because my time is running out but what we're trying to do is connect the dots between melchizedek coming down and offering bread and wine to abraham connect the dots to the covenant being changed and jesus sitting there in the upper room with that cup that he says this is the cup of the new testament in my blood and he's offering them bread and wine that's that same man that offered offer bread and wine to abraham there and now he's sitting in that upper room offering bread and wine to them as a type that on the day of pentecost they're going to receive that bread and wine they're going to they're going to receive the spirit quickening that word you see what is what is that bread and white bread and wine is communion and so when we come to the house of the lord we're communing with god and when you get in your prayer chamber at home and the word begins to be quicken to you you're in communion with god that's what god wants us to be in a communion with him so we understand him so that we have a relationship with him and he was the priest of the most high god see now it says melchizedek king of salem was the priest of the most high god there you got that king priest a king and a priest together and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god we shall deliver thine enemies into thy hand see abraham knew abraham knew that he couldn't have defeated all those men and you can't defeat whatever your obstacle this is this morning you can't do it of your own power but when god is on your side if your god is on your side that's all that matters and he gave him tithes of all and that's what every one of us when you realize that you're not coming to church just to hear some man then the tithe pagan will be different abraham realized that it wasn't just some man that he was talking to that he was receiving communion with but he was sitting down with a god that logos that came out of the father that manifested that actual the the attribute of the fullness of god was sitting there talking to him and so in verse 7 of hebrews chapter 7 of verse 1 of hebrews chapter 7 we get to finally get around to the to the main point is paul's saying for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace and brother brown would explain that and who is melchizedek everything coming together just like soul and body and spirit he's the king of everything without father this man didn't have any kind of natural genealogy that you could look at to say your natural genealogy doesn't matter this man takes care of everything without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils let's consider how great this man was this man was god come down to talk to abraham yes sir and you know brother brahman said and who's this melchizedek that every sin of us every seed of the promise is going to have to go through that same journey every single promise is going to have to meet melchizedek and how are you going to meet melchizedek you met melchizedek when god comes down in flesh and talks to you you meet melchizedek when god comes down and communes with you and you have a personal relationship with you and you see him and recognize him just like abraham did amen you know all down through the scripture they were looking looking for somebody to come that would meet that description of a royal high priest you know abraham there was a lot of good qualities about him but he he didn't he didn't meet up with the he had a lot of mistakes and isaac and brother brown would and a lot of his messages he was bring it on down all the way down to joseph how joseph looked like a perfect man that can could meet the the characteristics of somebody that would be able to open the book and meet the chara the qualifications but then he'd mess up with a few little things in his life that that that didn't quite tally up and and and moses and air and all the way down to to levi you see finally there come somebody that was removed from the genealogy see we get we get so often we look at the genie i'm trying to find you can't you can't qualify your new birth by looking at your natural birth your natural birth has nothing to do with your new birth your natural birth is a thing that you got to overcome and it's like it's like a problem that you it has there's nothing good in your natural birth like paul paul said in titus 3 9 avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable in vain there's nothing good in your genealogy that's why that's why he says in verse 3 without father without mother without descent that's why god actually removed a priest was supposed to come from the tribe of levi but he just removed that entirely from the equation and and in in genesis 49 the promises somebody that's going to come out of judah judah because but why because god's just flipping everything on its head it looks like i don't care what tribe you come from i don't care what your genealogy is this man is somebody that does not have a genealogy he's without father or mother after the power as paul explained further on this chapter after the power of an endless life the power of an endless life not the power of your natural genealogy i'm trying not to preach up here but you know that's that's a that's a promise it don't matter whether you're a bastard born whether you've got problems in your genealogy whether you go all the way back and you can find somebody that your mama and your daddy wasn't married all all sorts of things polygamy don't look at that because there's some there's a god that was without father or mother that's got the power of an endless life that can come and overcome all of that stuff all of that stuff we placed no confidence in our genealogy or whether we had something in our natural birth because the new birth takes care of all of that stuff and i got two more minutes so we'll we'll just stop on that and the musicians should go ahead and come forward but he said think brother brown said think of this great person of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man it was a person a man a personality he said an eternal person he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now god changing himself into person now see there you get into the godhead that we don't believe in a trinity of three different people but we believe in one god changing his mass in morphy coming down condescending until finally he dwells in your flesh you see that's why brother brown said it's not god one god like your finger not like your finger because god can dwell in the man christ jesus and then he can put that same life and you and me on the day of pentecost he put that life and all the ones that were up there in that upper room god masking himself veiled behind flesh we'll stop right there god bless you [Applause] [Music]
