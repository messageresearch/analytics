[0:51] comes in like a flood the God would lift
[0:55] up a
[0:56] standard against
[0:58] him who who is that enemy but Satan so
[1:02] the more he rages the more we keep

[10:00] 25th is that right uh 25th of this month
[10:05] he will be leaving for the

[10:11] weeks and all so we now not doing today
[10:15] we're announcing it a week ahead where
[10:17] you can uh get together with what you'd
[10:20] like but next Sunday we will be
[10:22] receiving a love offering for him to
[10:25] help him in his expenses and you know
[10:28] and the things is concurring because we
[10:30] the church is paying for the the tickets
[10:33] and we will be happening you know in a
[10:36] lot of the movement there so but we just
[10:40] you know ask you if you'd like to donate
[10:42] some to it you can do that the Lord will
[10:44] in next Sunday this coming up Sunday uh
[10:48] because you know that'll help him and
[10:51] all right so remember that okay let's go
[10:55] into
[10:57] Revelations 1
[11:01] and we'll begin with verse 10 I was in
[11:04] the spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[11:06] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[11:08] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[11:10] and the last and what thou see us write
[11:12] in a book and send it unto the seven
[11:15] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[11:18] and unto samna and to
[11:20] pergamus and unto Tiara and unto Sardis
[11:23] and Philadelphia and unto lady OA that's
[11:26] the age we're living in lady OA that's
[11:28] down to us all right so this message is
[11:31] to be each to each age and I turned to
[11:34] see the voice that spake with me and
[11:36] being turned I saw seven golden
[11:38] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[11:40] seven candlesticks one L unto the son of
[11:42] man clothed with a garment down to the
[11:46] foot and G about to PS with a golden
[11:49] girdle all right now let's go to
[11:52] John and we'll read the first
[11:55] 18 verses because I believe it pertains
[11:58] to to what we're trying to say anyway
[12:01] all right John 1 1 in the beginning was
[12:06] the word the word was with God and the
[12:09] Word was God the same was in the
[12:12] beginning with God now that sounds like
[12:15] there's a whole lot of people involved
[12:17] so that's what we're trying to get to is
[12:20] understanding the reading of the
[12:22] scripture is
[12:23] perfect it just needs to be interpreted
[12:27] right and that takes the holy spirit all
[12:30] right verse three all things were made
[12:32] by him and without him was not anything
[12:35] made that was made in him was life and
[12:38] the life was the light of men and the
[12:40] light shineth in darkness and the
[12:41] Darkness comprehended it not now it gets
[12:43] to John because he introduced him right
[12:46] there was a man sent from God whose name
[12:48] was John the same came for a witness to
[12:50] Bear witness of the light that all men
[12:53] through him might
[12:54] believe he was not that light but was
[12:58] sent to be witness of that light that
[13:01] was the True Light which lith every man
[13:04] that cometh into the world he was in the
[13:06] world and the world was made by him and
[13:08] the world knew him not now remember that
[13:11] the
[13:11] word the world was made by him all
[13:16] right and the world knew him not he came
[13:20] un his own and his own received him not
[13:22] but as many as received him to them gave
[13:25] he power to become the sons of God he
[13:29] gave them Authority gave him the
[13:32] right by his death burial resurrection
[13:36] and delivering all
[13:38] right which was born not of
[13:41] blood neither the will of Flesh nor the
[13:44] will of man but of God and the Word was
[13:47] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[13:49] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[13:52] only begotten of the father full of
[13:54] grace and truth John bear witness of him
[13:56] and cried saying this is this was he of
[14:00] whom I spake he that cometh after me is
[14:03] preferred before me for he was before me
[14:06] and his fullness have all we received
[14:09] and Grace for grace for the law was
[14:12] given by Moses but Grace and Truth came
[14:14] by Jesus Christ all right no man has
[14:18] seen God at any time the only begotten
[14:22] son which is in the bosom of the father
[14:25] he hath declared him you may be seated
[14:29] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[14:32] of the word now we have been trying
[14:37] to express some things
[14:40] and uh you know to open up our
[14:43] understanding and maybe this morning we
[14:45] might just preach just a little bit and
[14:48] you know quote some things
[14:50] but uh I want you to think
[14:55] about the scriptures and what it's
[14:57] saying
[14:59] and that way then we can you know go
[15:02] into a better understanding and like I
[15:05] said we read there
[15:07] in John
[15:09] 1 and it says in the beginning was the
[15:14] word all right and the Word was with
[15:19] God and the Word was God right all right
[15:24] now where can you get three out of
[15:27] that
[15:29] you know
[15:31] what I mean where can you get three out
[15:33] of plain
[15:35] reading in the beginning was the
[15:39] word and the Word was with
[15:42] god well that's
[15:45] two you
[15:46] know God and His word with him
[15:50] and but then it says and the
[15:53] Word was
[15:56] God all right so you're not looking at
[15:59] what we call the
[16:00] Trinity because it's not in the Bible
[16:03] anywhere show me the word Trinity at all
[16:05] it's not
[16:07] there that was developed by the Catholic
[16:10] church and somewhere in the 325 when
[16:13] they had the first Nan counsel that was
[16:15] the argument whether Jesus was God or a
[16:19] like
[16:21] substance and they determined there and
[16:24] the first one really made the statement
[16:26] that he was the substance but then
[16:29] as they begin to deteriorate later on to
[16:32] 606 by then they had come out of it that
[16:35] he was a like
[16:38] substance now if you make him a like
[16:41] substance you meaning something
[16:43] different you know all right so then you
[16:47] think
[16:48] about what mankind has done with the
[16:51] word of
[16:53] God they have perverted it to the point
[16:56] that you know now not the letter of it
[17:00] it says the same thing that it was
[17:01] saying when this was brought into
[17:04] translation from the the uh the Greeks
[17:06] and whatever it was run the Hebrews and
[17:08] things the word is the same the letter
[17:11] of the word has not been changed now
[17:13] there's many new
[17:15] versions you know many new Bibles that
[17:20] have come off and and a lot of that
[17:22] changes the meaning of what the word was
[17:27] but we believe in the King James version
[17:30] not that it was the version that James
[17:32] and John and them read it just means
[17:35] King James because it was at the time of
[17:37] the King James when he had it translated
[17:40] and brought down to mankind so they
[17:43] could read it uh they didn't have uh
[17:46] John
[17:48] 3:16 you know we're a little older than
[17:50] that we're a little smarter than that
[17:52] they didn't have these things this only
[17:55] come into being a couple hundred years
[17:57] ago when they begin to bring it down
[17:59] from the the Latin vgate and bringing it
[18:02] on down to where that we would get what
[18:06] we call now the King James version I've
[18:08] heard people say that they' say you know
[18:11] way on back in our time when our our
[18:13] denominational periods they'd say that
[18:15] you know that this Bible here was good
[18:17] enough for Peter and Paul and it's good
[18:20] enough for me well the the revelation of
[18:24] the word
[18:25] was but not the letters they were
[18:27] quoting from
[18:29] because they were brought into being a
[18:30] long time after then all
[18:34] right but see instead of staying then
[18:38] with the
[18:39] scripture and believing it as it is
[18:43] said we take in our mind and try to
[18:47] conceive you know figure out that's the
[18:51] uh problem with
[18:53] humanity is we try to figure out what's
[18:56] going on but it's like I've said now and
[18:58] I won't spend no time on it but you know
[19:01] uh you take and read the Bible in
[19:04] Genesis and you know when this fall came
[19:07] and oh they ate an
[19:09] apple well now you know there's nothing
[19:14] in there that says that all right they
[19:17] ate the forbidden fruit that's right so
[19:20] he said well okay it's a pomegranate
[19:22] it's a peach it's a this no
[19:24] no you go into that and you try to
[19:27] figure out what it's talking about and
[19:30] but yet if I took a
[19:33] newspaper and I brought it to you and I
[19:36] said would you read this out of the
[19:40] newspaper and you would read that there
[19:42] was a man and a
[19:45] woman you know and then there was a an
[19:49] animal there which the Bible says this
[19:51] serpent was most sub of all Beast so he
[19:54] a serpent is a snake he was made a a
[19:57] snake later in the fact of being cursed
[19:59] he was a beast all right and you put a
[20:02] man and a woman and a beast and you read
[20:04] it out of a
[20:05] newspaper we know what
[20:09] happened right right we oh we've got a
[20:14] little sense we know what happened there
[20:16] but reading it out of the Bible you
[20:19] think you've got to make it something to
[20:21] interpret some way and when you do your
[20:24] concept comes out of it being contrary
[20:27] to the word
[20:29] all right you say yeah but brother Dale
[20:30] there got to be three Gods because here
[20:33] on the River Jordan was a a voice from
[20:36] up in heaven and a dove coming down and
[20:38] Jesus standing on the earth so there's
[20:41] got to be three of
[20:42] them you know well then some agree that
[20:46] there's uh two and some went into the
[20:50] four square movements of the Pentecost
[20:52] tool you got all kind of ideas trying to
[20:55] figure out what it said
[20:59] but why not read what it says
[21:02] right it just
[21:04] says the Holy Spirit descended in the
[21:07] form of a
[21:08] dove all right something was happening
[21:13] that we need to
[21:16] understanding so is it with the
[21:18] understanding here we read in the
[21:20] beginning was the
[21:22] word all
[21:24] right and the Word was with God
[21:31] and the Word was
[21:34] God well that's simple language you read
[21:37] that out of a newspaper in the
[21:39] morning you understand my point of
[21:42] illustration about the garden and
[21:43] reading it you go read out of the paper
[21:46] in the morning you're not mly confused
[21:49] about
[21:49] wordings even though I get confused
[21:52] because of the wordings they use
[21:54] sometimes today is is beyond my day of
[21:58] you know A and B and C uh they got these
[22:02] big old words that I have to get to
[22:04] dictionary and look them up all right
[22:07] but still follow the
[22:10] point
[22:11] that this one that you're talking
[22:16] about it says verse
[22:19] two the same was in the
[22:22] beginning with
[22:24] god well with God means with it means
[22:28] you know that oh two of
[22:30] them now uh brother
[22:35] Lise just returned from Nicaragua and I
[22:38] enjoyed his uh things that he covered
[22:40] there Wednesday night I really
[22:42] appreciate it but you know what he made
[22:45] a statement out of it he said uh some of
[22:48] your help went to go over there you know
[22:52] to do things well you know what he was
[22:54] with
[22:56] him right if you get gave him $1 and he
[22:59] took it over there and spent it over
[23:01] there for something related then you was
[23:03] with him right no no no I wasn't with
[23:06] him brother Dale I was over here you're
[23:09] you're not thinking
[23:12] right the word with doesn't signify that
[23:15] there got to be two people to be you
[23:18] know uh brother htis used to have a way
[23:21] of saying and he said the only time I
[23:23] know I'm carrying on a sensal
[23:24] conversation is when I'm speaking by to
[23:27] my own self
[23:28] you know well that's with you know it
[23:33] doesn't mean that there's got to be two
[23:36] people all right let's pull it back up
[23:39] and let's go on down a little bit in
[23:41] this and we'll we'll just preach a
[23:44] little bit from this point and try to
[23:46] help but pull back up John 1 and where
[23:50] we can read
[23:52] it and look what it's
[23:54] saying in the beginning was the word and
[23:57] the Word was with God God and the Word
[23:58] was God the same was in the beginning
[24:00] with God all things were made by him and
[24:04] without
[24:06] him without was not anything
[24:09] made that was
[24:11] made in him was life and the life was
[24:14] the light of men all
[24:16] right now all things were created by
[24:19] this
[24:20] person you see I don't believe in three
[24:23] gods that would you can't find that in
[24:26] the Bible you find it in your
[24:29] interpretations the first what is it
[24:31] first second or one in other
[24:33] Commandments that the Lord thy God is
[24:35] one amen well now Israel didn't have no
[24:39] Trinity they didn't have no problems
[24:42] that's right and that was why they
[24:44] killed Jesus because they could see that
[24:47] he was referring to the fact that he was
[24:51] the
[24:54] Messiah right right and they didn't
[24:57] believe he was was that Messiah right
[24:59] because they believe that Messiah will
[25:02] be God in flesh
[25:05] right that's their belief all right so
[25:09] then in believing it that way when Jesus
[25:11] began to talk about the things they said
[25:14] you're a man making yourself
[25:17] God but their own Bible
[25:20] said that he was born
[25:24] Emmanuel which is what God With Us
[25:28] us but see we want to put our own
[25:32] thoughts and
[25:33] ideas and and you know it's kind of odd
[25:36] now that you're getting these things
[25:38] after 2,000 years of doing or I don't
[25:41] know how long it's been since they'
[25:43] started using the Christmas tree that
[25:44] ain't none of my business cuz I don't
[25:46] care you say well it was Old Saint Nick
[25:49] you know I don't know I just know one
[25:54] thing now you buy a Manger that you used
[25:58] to
[25:59] buy and now there's a little addition to
[26:02] that
[26:04] right and you got a manger scene and
[26:06] it'll have a gloryia
[26:09] there
[26:12] right see then you buy a upper room
[26:17] experience instead of just seeing the 12
[26:20] they
[26:21] 13 because they got a glory there you
[26:25] know they've got to get this femin part
[26:28] into
[26:29] it all
[26:31] right because that's their
[26:34] point and see a picture we say is better
[26:36] than a thousand words you know
[26:39] why because words disappear from your
[26:42] mind unless you have a good
[26:45] memory but pictures are embedded into
[26:49] the seeing are embedded every other word
[26:52] into your seeing and that
[26:55] picture stays with
[26:58] you that's the way you remember that's
[27:01] the way you're driving down the highway
[27:02] and you go somewhere one time you don't
[27:05] have to look at the mouth the second
[27:06] time right why because of the memory of
[27:09] the vision or whatever this is there
[27:11] that's there this is there if you'll
[27:12] notice the way I describe it I'll tell
[27:14] you the roads that goes there and then
[27:16] I'll tell you you go down here and this
[27:17] road it turns to the right there be a
[27:19] McDonald's on the right hand side what
[27:21] am I doing I'm setting your mind to
[27:23] where when you're traveling even though
[27:25] you may forget the number of the road
[27:28] but in your mind you are looking for the
[27:31] McDonald's
[27:33] right and that's what is done through
[27:36] wording in things talking see brother
[27:40] brandham said it like
[27:42] this he said all a preacher does is
[27:45] breaks a spell over the people's mind
[27:49] that God can speak to them now that's
[27:52] good
[27:53] thinking you know you said well brother
[27:56] D what are you trying to do all I'm
[27:58] trying to do is to speak enough word to
[28:00] you that you then God can come back in
[28:05] the middle of the night or somewhere and
[28:07] bring that back to your
[28:09] remembrance you say well hey that's
[28:13] right see I'm trying to make that well
[28:15] then you take a picture and actually
[28:17] using this uh screen and the reading of
[28:22] the scriptures I I used to be against
[28:25] that because it does have a tendency to
[28:27] do away with you uh using your Bible
[28:30] right all right but I realized that
[28:35] hey those letters are being embedded
[28:38] into your mind more than it is for you
[28:40] to look down right that's why we give
[28:44] illustrations and we draw out things and
[28:47] to get you to continue your thought and
[28:50] remember it later all right and see in
[28:53] doing that then we can look at at
[28:56] something and it comes into our
[29:00] being part of us until we we we we come
[29:04] forth with an image or a picture in
[29:09] mind of what is being portrayed all
[29:12] right but see if we take the picture
[29:15] wrongly we say with God you
[29:18] know well that's two
[29:21] people
[29:23] right but you see I have many
[29:26] manifestations about me a father son I'm
[29:30] a human being I'm a granddaddy I'm a
[29:32] great granddaddy I'm pastor of a church
[29:35] I was an employee at General Motors I've
[29:37] got many many titles or forms that you
[29:41] can look
[29:42] at but I'm only one
[29:46] person well that's the Simplicity of
[29:48] looking at God that
[29:51] way now I I say this for your benefit
[29:54] but not for me to question if there is a
[29:57] God
[29:59] God now that's for you to
[30:02] think if there is a God you mean he
[30:05] can't keep his word
[30:09] straight they's got to judge you by
[30:11] something according to the scripture he
[30:13] said no the the father there's no
[30:15] judgment there are the judgments in the
[30:16] hands of the
[30:21] son but if we can see that that son and
[30:25] father is the selfs same person
[30:28] just say I'm a son I'm a
[30:31] father I have many manifestations but
[30:33] I'm just one person if we can see that
[30:35] about God then we'll go into correct
[30:38] understanding but now I also charge you
[30:41] or or have been recently about it
[30:43] because I went back and listened to the
[30:45] the
[30:47] services see you you don't want to go
[30:50] into the to the
[30:52] Trinity God in three persons Blessed
[30:54] Trinity show me any scripture for that
[30:57] God in three persons if there's a person
[30:59] there's a personality the personality is
[31:01] an individual individual is a person you
[31:03] got three literal Gods not even thinking
[31:06] it there are people that believe that
[31:07] there's three literal
[31:09] Gods all right the deception is when the
[31:15] Catholic Church brought it about they
[31:16] didn't bring it about as to be three
[31:19] literal Gods necessarily setting oh now
[31:22] daddy you set over there son you sat
[31:24] here Holy Ghost you set here
[31:28] now don't y'all cross each other's seats
[31:29] you got your seats you always stay there
[31:32] you
[31:33] know well see they knew that couldn't go
[31:36] over so they brought it into the form
[31:38] and says well
[31:39] it's God in another
[31:45] um
[31:47] person called a
[31:50] son well right now do you believe in
[31:53] Eternal sunship now that's the question
[31:55] I've asked and the prophets ask you what
[31:58] do you
[31:59] believe how can a son be
[32:03] Eternal because the word son signifies
[32:07] somewhere it had a beginning amen right
[32:10] right that's
[32:12] right you said well now wait a minute
[32:14] you're flipping I'm flipping because I
[32:16] got to flip okay bear with
[32:20] me but
[32:25] listen in all of the scriptures we find
[32:30] out that there's only one person with
[32:35] many
[32:36] manifestations amen all right then
[32:39] that's not God in three person's Blessed
[32:41] Trinity right right that's getting to
[32:44] the truth but you got to watch it
[32:47] because I was talking with somebody just
[32:49] the other day about it and I I mean it
[32:53] and strongly mean it that the biggest
[32:56] portion of the people that I hear preach
[32:59] now I said I hear over the times I've
[33:03] listened most of the Ministers of this
[33:05] message are really
[33:07] Oneness they fought the trinitarian
[33:10] concept so much until they've moved away
[33:13] from it and they go into a Oneness
[33:19] concept all right there's a Doctrine out
[33:21] there called Oneness and the Oneness is
[33:24] we say it's like your finger because
[33:25] that's a way of expressing it that the
[33:27] Old Testament was God you know the
[33:30] father Jehovah and then Jesus
[33:34] came and there's no father he's out of
[33:37] the way Jesus is all of it because in
[33:39] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[33:41] bodily see they can quote scriptures to
[33:42] you all right but then coming in the
[33:45] last days as or coming in the as the
[33:47] Holy Spirit but yet they don't believe
[33:51] and the best way of saying it is they
[33:54] don't believe that there is an another
[33:57] form of God after Jesus Christ right all
[34:01] right now I differ there totally because
[34:04] I believe the Born Again experience
[34:06] makes you right in your new birth a
[34:10] child of God you agree and if you're a
[34:14] child of God you're God in another form
[34:16] is that simple because the form means
[34:18] that you just change from one form to
[34:20] the other but it's the same
[34:24] God all right that's why Jesus would say
[34:27] before Abraham
[34:29] was I
[34:32] am right right and he would say
[34:36] Phillip if you seen
[34:39] me you seen the
[34:44] father he never spoke of another
[34:47] God somewhere
[34:50] else the Bible says there's God's
[34:53] many right I mean the Bible says that
[34:55] there's God's many
[34:57] but Paul will tell you I believe it's
[34:59] right in one but any house where it says
[35:00] God's many he's plainly stating that
[35:03] none of them is worth anything because
[35:05] there's got to be one
[35:09] God all right and his name is the Lord
[35:13] Jesus
[35:14] Christ all right now what's the name of
[35:17] the father what do you mean brother Dale
[35:18] what's the name of the Father the name
[35:20] of the father's father well I'll write
[35:21] you a check you want a check for a
[35:23] million
[35:24] dollars I'll be glad to write you one
[35:26] decide
[35:29] father
[35:31] right would you take it to the
[35:33] bank well I'll help you out I'll F
[35:35] father son Holy Ghost I'll put human
[35:39] I'll put pastor I'll put any anything
[35:42] you want me to title it right these kids
[35:46] are smart enough to know they ain't
[35:47] going to the bank with
[35:49] it but if I signed a check Samuel you
[35:53] got a reason for taking it because you
[35:55] got a name
[35:57] connected to
[35:59] it all right see that's why we baptize
[36:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:04] because the Bible says in the name of
[36:05] the father and of the son and of the
[36:08] Holy Ghost father is not a name son's
[36:10] not a name Holy Ghost is not a
[36:12] name but it's Lord Jesus Christ right
[36:16] that's why in Acts it said to be
[36:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all
[36:20] right now watch that in a minute when we
[36:22] get to that
[36:25] Christ but what I'm trying to get us to
[36:29] look at is not the Oneness thought and
[36:33] get lost in it until we become a Oneness
[36:37] and don't know
[36:39] it and uh you know a lot of people
[36:42] they'll take the quote from the prophet
[36:44] and there's plenty of them and I believe
[36:46] he meant what he said and said what he
[36:48] meant he said all God was he poured into
[36:50] Christ all Christ poured into the
[36:53] church you know and take her back to the
[36:56] Garden of Eden
[36:57] but now interpret that by your own
[36:59] natural
[37:00] concept all God
[37:04] was you just done away with something
[37:07] right you got an empty space right I
[37:10] don't care about your beautiful drawings
[37:12] that shows this light going over you
[37:14] left an empty
[37:16] space I don't care about all of your
[37:18] mentalities of all meaning
[37:22] all you
[37:25] know and see you're going into the
[37:27] Oneness Doctrine right cuz all God was
[37:30] he poured into Christ well then there's
[37:31] no more God that's all
[37:35] Christ right then you say all Christ
[37:37] report into the church then there no
[37:38] more Christ it's the church you don't
[37:41] you don't get what I mean by that I know
[37:42] you don't cuz if you got it you jump up
[37:44] and shout hallelujah hallelujah right at
[37:48] least sit down and say
[37:53] it but
[37:55] listen see we can be so
[37:59] confused until we don't know we we're
[38:02] confused I don't ask for a raise of hand
[38:05] but how many of you used to believe in
[38:06] the
[38:12] Trinity you used to believe in a lie but
[38:15] you swore by it you swore that's what
[38:17] the Bible said there's been Wars
[38:20] probably fought over whether or not that
[38:23] it was one God or two or three right
[38:27] but see then when the Oneness came out
[38:29] they came out with the points of
[38:31] bringing it you go to a real
[38:34] Oneness and you talk to a Oneness about
[38:37] what you believe brother dick finds you
[38:38] one he likes to do that he knows if I
[38:41] tell him something he can go out find
[38:42] him one go find your good Oneness and
[38:44] get him to explain it I told you about
[38:47] it when I was in Jamaica for three
[38:49] nights in a row I preached on one true
[38:51] and living God and those Oneness people
[38:53] shouted it was a Oneness convention
[38:58] and they shouted over
[39:01] it because see what I was saying was the
[39:04] exact scriptures they were
[39:11] saying but you see they won't go
[39:13] on they stay back in that one part see a
[39:17] Oneness then is
[39:18] what I do that like I'm picking myself
[39:21] up you
[39:23] know all God
[39:25] was poured into
[39:27] Jesus if you're Oneness you just moved
[39:29] over here and you don't need nothing
[39:31] over
[39:32] there
[39:34] right but see the true Oneness won't
[39:36] tear it on over to the
[39:39] church that's why they're Oneness they
[39:41] sto back
[39:43] there but I hope you've been listening
[39:45] or thinking about what I've been saying
[39:47] about that maybe You' never thought
[39:50] about the Oneness concept of what people
[39:52] does with
[39:53] it you hear the preachers of this
[39:55] message preach so beautiful a picture of
[39:58] one God but watch them they'll always
[40:02] end at a certain
[40:06] point well how can we end un
[40:09] understanding of God at any
[40:11] point I thought we believe the prophet
[40:14] said there would be a message of
[40:17] cheer after this world is over with it
[40:19] we be understanding I thought it was to
[40:22] be an eternal partaking of the
[40:25] revelation of God
[40:28] my concept of that is one thing we're
[40:30] just getting enough while we're here to
[40:32] be able to enjoy when we get over there
[40:37] right and you know what I still don't do
[40:39] away with a lot of things and get over
[40:41] there you know that he that to the bride
[40:44] is she's going he's going to be a
[40:46] special person to the
[40:48] bride you know the foolish virgins and
[40:50] things cuz they get eternal life won't
[40:52] have the understanding you
[40:54] have so they still going to going to be
[40:56] degrees so there's still going to be
[40:58] somebody we can talk to there's still
[40:59] going to be somebody we can sit down for
[41:01] a millennial Reign and talk to people
[41:05] about God your Prophet says they would
[41:09] be a gospel to the Heathen in the
[41:13] Millennium now you interpret what he's
[41:15] saying that's that's his words it's
[41:19] about 14 15 Church age book somewhere
[41:21] right in
[41:23] there but do you understand what I'm
[41:25] getting at I'm trying to get us to look
[41:27] at one true and living
[41:32] God and you
[41:35] see in my home especially when we're
[41:38] sitting
[41:40] around you know we get together we we're
[41:42] eating together or we we have our time
[41:45] together we have Thanksgiving we always
[41:47] get together uh Christmas we get
[41:49] together we get together as much as we
[41:51] can as a family well you know brother uh
[41:54] Quinn I believe it's right he
[41:58] said I'm pretty sure brother Quinn or
[42:01] brother prash one he said brother Dale
[42:03] said I sat there today and watched you
[42:05] said your whole family was around
[42:09] you and said you was sitting there
[42:12] enjoying
[42:14] it I said you're exactly
[42:18] right because I can think about my
[42:20] children as
[42:22] being part of
[42:24] me and think of even the offsprings you
[42:27] know or the things and the even the the
[42:29] ones that have married into the family
[42:31] and things that I
[42:33] can think about them and think about how
[42:37] they're have extended me out into
[42:40] another
[42:44] form you know there as we all sit around
[42:47] the table and eating we we started out
[42:49] with a little table and we've gotten out
[42:51] of where I think is let's see 1 2 3 4 5
[42:54] we get about 10 or 12 around the table
[42:56] and then we have to put these other
[42:57] tables cuz the family keeps
[43:00] increasing and uh you know as that
[43:02] family increases you know it's me
[43:05] increasing
[43:07] right the DNA is there to prove exactly
[43:10] to the children the grandchildren the
[43:13] great grandchildren and I wish I could
[43:15] live to be 150 years old and see great
[43:17] great great great great
[43:21] great why because brother the brother
[43:25] caught what I was doing he said you were
[43:26] just sitting there grinning looking
[43:27] around I said yeah cuz I look at my
[43:31] family and I think that they're saved
[43:33] and serving the
[43:36] lord you know at least doing the best
[43:38] they
[43:39] can that they're you know they're in
[43:41] church and they're do it well you know
[43:43] what that's an extension of myself so
[43:45] right there in one little meeting I can
[43:47] be many many
[43:50] things but to my wife I'm a
[43:52] husband to my children I'm a father
[43:56] right to my grandchildren I'm a
[43:58] grandfather great grand I'm a great
[44:00] great grandfather and you know what I
[44:02] can talk to all of
[44:04] them but they know who I'm talking
[44:08] about right they know by the words I'm
[44:12] using that who I'm talking about is
[44:15] my you know many forms that are sitting
[44:21] there and see then we try to limit God
[44:23] to the bases that we want to make him to
[44:26] where well now brother Dale there was
[44:28] Jesus standing down here and praying to
[44:30] the father that's exactly right long as
[44:32] you keep that in your Doctrine you won't
[44:34] go to a
[44:39] Oneness you want proof of it what did
[44:42] the prophet say one
[44:45] day people were talking to him evidently
[44:48] about something and and they were trying
[44:50] to convince him of a trinity
[44:53] problem and he said you believe you're
[44:55] born again again don't
[44:58] you I'm paraphrasing it so pretty
[45:01] close he said you believe you're born
[45:04] again said now who do you pray
[45:10] to who do you pray
[45:14] to Jesus had no problem saying Our
[45:16] Father which are in heaven which was a
[45:17] prior to be for us more than for him
[45:20] right but still he had no problems with
[45:23] doing
[45:24] that right
[45:27] what's the problem with one form
[45:29] communicating with the other
[45:32] form who do you pray to if you got the
[45:35] Holy Ghost in you then according to what
[45:38] we believe you have Father Son and Holy
[45:40] Ghost in you as a new birth right cuz
[45:44] we're not Oneness or Trinity that would
[45:46] tell you now be careful you remember
[45:49] them good old Baptist you know that
[45:50] trinitarian be careful now we got to
[45:53] give the father and the son the Holy
[45:56] Ghost all equal parts of our
[45:59] Salvation cuz we don't want to leave one
[46:01] of them out of
[46:04] it your mind don't click back sometimes
[46:06] to when you were sitting there listening
[46:08] how they were trying to explain all
[46:09] these beautiful things and it sounded so
[46:11] great to you but now you look at it and
[46:14] you say man how confused we
[46:19] were you you get what I'm
[46:22] saying see you got to keep that
[46:25] communication
[46:28] gap between Father and
[46:34] Son there's got to be a communication
[46:36] gap to where they can
[46:38] communicate now if that's not right I
[46:40] want you to explain where it
[46:44] says let
[46:47] us if there ain't no communication in
[46:49] your understanding of Doctrine or ideas
[46:52] you better disc considerer the Bible
[46:54] does say let us make
[46:58] man in our own
[47:01] image and our own likeness right now
[47:05] who's the US oh well it's got to be
[47:14] two father and son is not to if you
[47:18] understand it correctly that's
[47:23] right if you understand it it's not
[47:26] true cuz you ain't listening to what I
[47:28] said I can sit there at the table and be
[47:30] father
[47:31] son grandfather great-grandfather
[47:36] husband and just sit there and enjoy
[47:39] it see the Bible says that through the
[47:43] things that we see that the even the
[47:46] Eternal godhead of my quoting the
[47:48] scripture can be understood by the
[47:50] things that we
[47:52] see I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human
[47:57] it doesn't make three out of
[47:59] it yeah but we don't want to leave
[48:01] nobody out the if you got the right
[48:03] understanding you're not leaving anybody
[48:05] out
[48:06] right see you're coming forth with the
[48:09] right understanding to where that you
[48:12] can get the concept of what it's talking
[48:15] about all
[48:17] right so go ahead now and pull back up
[48:19] what we're doing and pull it down to
[48:21] verse um 14
[48:24] brother C very familiar with each one of
[48:26] us but what is it in the beginning was
[48:28] the word word was with God and the Word
[48:29] was
[48:31] God the same was in the beginning with
[48:34] God all things were made by
[48:37] him not
[48:40] them all things were made by him and
[48:43] without him was not anything made that
[48:46] was
[48:48] made now that's simple enough to
[48:50] understand the one truth but go on over
[48:54] to verse 14 because surely we know who
[48:56] this is in verse 14 it says and the
[49:00] word 13 says which was born not not of
[49:04] blood because it wasn't the blood of man
[49:06] that brought forth a body Eve never
[49:09] produced an
[49:10] egg for the Holy Ghost to Quicken it
[49:13] that make sinful mankind having to do
[49:15] with the body and that's incorrect that
[49:18] could not have been Hebrews 105 which
[49:20] says a body thou Hast prepared
[49:24] me
[49:26] right so watch which were born not of
[49:29] blood nor of the will of the flesh nor
[49:30] of the will of man but of God and the
[49:32] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[49:35] Us who was that who was made flesh and
[49:39] dwelt Among Us now the great Jehovah God
[49:42] through the Old Testament the best you
[49:44] can get closest you can get to him was
[49:46] when he appeared to mzc as MDC to
[49:49] Abraham all right but remember that was
[49:53] a spoken into existence and out of
[49:55] existence
[49:56] that would be no kin
[49:59] folks and you remember the Book of
[50:02] Ruth in the Book of Ruth there had to be
[50:04] a kinsman redeemer the kinsman redeemer
[50:07] had to be kin folks right right so he
[50:11] had to be kin folk so what'd he do he
[50:12] had to become flesh who had to become
[50:14] flesh oh he sent his son we'll get to
[50:16] that in a minute you mean you'd send
[50:18] your son to
[50:20] die come on no God came
[50:24] himself right
[50:26] come on get it in the right order see
[50:29] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[50:30] us we beheld his glory the glory as the
[50:32] only begotten of the
[50:34] father full of grace and truth you know
[50:36] he was the only
[50:41] begotten yeah but now I've been begotten
[50:44] you had to be begotten through Jesus
[50:46] Christ coming and giving his
[50:50] life he's the only
[50:53] begotten right Adam came into
[50:59] existence right he was created right but
[51:04] he wasn't
[51:07] begotten the word begotten means that
[51:09] you come in which we're going to get in
[51:10] a couple of scriptures reason I said
[51:12] would cover
[51:13] this the word begotten comes to the
[51:16] point
[51:17] of not a separate
[51:21] creation but the same person in another
[51:25] form form where we get a little further
[51:27] let's keep on going going over now to
[51:29] verse 18 where we was
[51:31] at all
[51:33] right and it
[51:35] says no man has seen God at any time
[51:39] well that's exactly
[51:41] right the only begotten
[51:45] son there's that begotten verse 14 that
[51:48] was
[51:49] begotten all right which is in the bosom
[51:53] of the father he has declared him look
[51:56] at your original translation in the
[51:57] middle it means he brought him out in
[51:59] the
[52:01] open right he made him known you ever
[52:05] thought about
[52:08] bum I guess that's why I was sitting
[52:10] there doing that yesterday and I I
[52:12] thought well I need to cover bum and I
[52:14] got to running a lot of things and
[52:15] looking up a lot of things about it and
[52:17] looking up definitions of the word
[52:20] bum I didn't know I was going to use it
[52:22] today but in me from what I was looking
[52:27] there the word bosom signifies the chest
[52:32] part of an
[52:34] individual
[52:36] right and the Bible talks about being
[52:38] the bosom of Abraham we know that that's
[52:40] not being in literally the bosom of
[52:42] Abraham there was no way for the people
[52:44] to get there it was the faith of Abraham
[52:46] so now you're dealing with something
[52:48] other than abom like we do you remember
[52:52] uh Eli
[52:56] El Shad there in the scripture to
[52:57] Abraham was come
[53:01] and breasted
[53:03] one receive your
[53:06] strength all right mother takes a baby
[53:09] and pulls it into her
[53:11] bosom and you know that little fell he's
[53:14] heard that heartbeat all the time in the
[53:16] body and you know you can't fool
[53:20] him you may be able to work with him a
[53:22] little bit but you can't fool him cuz
[53:25] you take immediately when that baby's
[53:27] born take it and put it to a bosom of a
[53:29] woman that's not the real mother that
[53:31] gave birth he'll scream and cry you may
[53:34] oh yeah he'll get hungry enough after a
[53:36] while he'll eat anything
[53:38] right but he he he
[53:41] Rebels why because he's been in that
[53:44] person that's right right and he knows
[53:47] that heartbeat and that speaking and
[53:49] like I say about most of the babies here
[53:52] they know my voice before they get here
[53:55] because they're sitting there and the
[53:57] mama listening right and be careful what
[54:00] you're taking those little babies around
[54:01] even in your bosom like that you
[54:05] know today that's what gets me as people
[54:08] to smoking drinking and stuff like that
[54:10] and
[54:11] doping and that poor little kid comes in
[54:13] a world a dope
[54:15] head that tears me
[54:18] up that this makes
[54:20] me you
[54:22] know but have you ever thought about
[54:24] what bosom really
[54:29] means the Bible uses it in a lot of ways
[54:31] and phrases of bism but it literally
[54:34] means the front
[54:36] part
[54:37] inwardly not just sticking out as a
[54:40] breast to
[54:42] do it it means the the part of
[54:48] you uh may I get to it later in
[54:51] understanding it means your nature and
[54:54] your ways and
[54:55] a lot of
[54:57] that but
[54:59] it it has one meaning that was very deep
[55:02] to me and made it me think about
[55:05] it what is the center part of your
[55:09] inward
[55:12] being it's your
[55:17] heart your
[55:21] heart now the heart of mankind
[55:25] is a little thumping GE ready to go b b
[55:29] Bo well now that can't describe exactly
[55:33] what you want to about
[55:37] it that's why the Bible will speak of
[55:39] heart and
[55:41] soul because it's bringing it to the
[55:44] being of what you
[55:46] are look up bosom and you'll find that
[55:49] it will tell you that is the very heart
[55:52] of something that heart right in the
[55:54] center is the
[55:57] bosom I love the things the prophet
[55:59] would say that Jesus was the very heart
[56:02] and soul amen of God he said you know
[56:06] why because he was
[56:09] God all right we'll get to it this
[56:11] afternoon a little bit about his nature
[56:13] and his ways or condescending or
[56:16] whatever but I'm just wanting you to
[56:20] think the bosom of ab bosom of the
[56:23] father
[56:26] the very heart of almighty
[56:28] God was displayed on Earth
[56:32] amen all
[56:34] right now the body was a
[56:37] creation right a 16 element creation he
[56:41] could have given you a blood
[56:43] transfusion because it was a 16 element
[56:49] form but the spirit and soul that was
[56:52] inside of there was almighty God Amen or
[56:55] else you're back to your Trinity or
[56:57] Oneness or somewhere
[56:59] again well I just don't I don't know
[57:01] about God having a soul
[57:08] will go
[57:09] ahead I've tried for almost 50 years to
[57:12] explain
[57:15] that that's not
[57:17] joking got tapes to prove
[57:20] it most of you have been around here
[57:22] long enough you've heard me preach on
[57:23] one God enough to know
[57:25] that of what I
[57:28] believe brother randam said in spirit he
[57:31] was God I'll give you these but said in
[57:35] flesh he was a
[57:37] man that's true right that's exactly
[57:40] true he said in Soul he was God
[57:46] Amen but said in body he was a
[57:50] man that's exactly right right you are a
[57:54] body Body Spirit and the Soul
[57:57] right now he created
[58:01] us no matter where you want to think
[58:04] about your doings or whatever you want
[58:05] to go and the great message people of
[58:08] how they try to push you here and make
[58:09] you back
[58:12] dire still remember one
[58:15] thing God created us
[58:19] right
[58:22] right
[58:23] now but
[58:27] he was never
[58:29] created you remember that that was the
[58:32] last kind of where we were getting to
[58:33] where the Prophet said that that God's
[58:36] first creation was God himself now how
[58:39] can you explain
[58:42] that
[58:43] amen it's got to be explaining one God
[58:46] or you got a transan concept or some
[58:48] kind of thought it's messed up all
[58:51] right
[58:53] but
[58:56] if that man standing on the River
[58:59] Jordan wasn't already
[59:03] God before that anointing came on him
[59:05] that everybody in the message wants to
[59:07] make some kind of a that he wouldn't God
[59:09] until then the Bible said he was born
[59:11] God your Prophet said what about your
[59:14] Jehovah god with no teeth you heard them
[59:18] amen he said you're Jehovah God playing
[59:22] as a little boy that's right
[59:26] but see this great Revelation oh but but
[59:29] all that's all that's not true CU he
[59:31] just finally become god well what was he
[59:34] before he become God and where did he go
[59:36] after God left him as they want to
[59:41] say that's what I was telling them last
[59:43] night in the in the fell in the Bible
[59:46] study you
[59:48] know there used to be a Doctrine among
[59:50] the people of the message I guess it
[59:52] still goes we just don't hear about it
[59:55] some of your older ones will remember
[59:57] some of the doctrin that went along they
[1:00:00] had one called spiritual
[1:00:04] husband and that doctorine a lot of you
[1:00:06] come along later didn't hear it but some
[1:00:08] of you was old was back there and with
[1:00:10] his kids and you heard
[1:00:12] it and that Doctrine was that you
[1:00:16] couldn't go to no other Church except
[1:00:18] your
[1:00:20] pastor cuz he was your
[1:00:23] husband
[1:00:25] and they called it spiritual husband
[1:00:26] right brother
[1:00:27] Ray a lot of it went around we heard
[1:00:30] didn't we okay he said
[1:00:34] okay see he was back there with a lot of
[1:00:37] that I was back there with a lot of that
[1:00:39] we heard a lot of that well they had one
[1:00:42] that's called spiritual husband I said
[1:00:44] and they in other words you as a
[1:00:47] congregation are my wife I am your
[1:00:51] husband in the Lord now
[1:00:57] well I know I'm sarcastic and I'm a
[1:00:59] dirty old dude I'm
[1:01:01] sorry but you know what I asked the
[1:01:06] preachers I said okay we're a
[1:01:08] congregation we're your
[1:01:10] wife you're saying we don't go you know
[1:01:13] out and listen to nobody else cuz that'd
[1:01:16] be
[1:01:17] adultery I said how come you preachers
[1:01:19] are going preach in these other churches
[1:01:21] you're committing adultery against me
[1:01:24] cuz I'm your
[1:01:26] wife well they didn't like that I'll
[1:01:29] clap on that in myself they didn't like
[1:01:32] that because it exposed them for what
[1:01:35] they were doing it was okay for them to
[1:01:37] go preach but it was wrong for you to go
[1:01:39] listen to anybody
[1:01:41] else okay bring it on down
[1:01:45] today they don't want the internet
[1:01:48] system to be floating too
[1:01:52] much come on
[1:01:55] some of these know what I'm talking
[1:01:57] about we had meetings
[1:02:00] here about the internet the couple are
[1:02:03] grinning that was here because they
[1:02:06] didn't want you to go on internet with
[1:02:08] your message brother
[1:02:11] dick people be
[1:02:16] listening
[1:02:19] right they was against the internet
[1:02:21] they're still against the
[1:02:23] internet
[1:02:27] so we'll narrow it on down into one
[1:02:29] thing and we'll say that a lot of the
[1:02:31] Pastors in this
[1:02:34] message you can't get their
[1:02:38] tapes unless you sign
[1:02:43] in you just signed your name Miss MIRS
[1:02:47] so and so when you sign in to listen to
[1:02:50] them you sign your name MIRS every who
[1:02:52] you listening to
[1:02:55] I know I'm
[1:02:58] dirty but is that true
[1:03:01] amen that's why I tell you listen to who
[1:03:04] you want to but just remember one
[1:03:07] thing if I don't agree with it I will
[1:03:10] tell you from the pull pit I don't agree
[1:03:12] with
[1:03:14] it right not because I'm a spiritual
[1:03:18] husband but because my daddy don't agree
[1:03:20] with
[1:03:22] it right right if my daddy don't agree
[1:03:26] with it I'm going to tell you I don't
[1:03:28] agree with it because he's my
[1:03:30] daddy you know the daddy I'm talking
[1:03:32] about the
[1:03:35] word if it don't match up in this word
[1:03:37] then I'm going to let you know in a
[1:03:38] hurry I don't agree with it cuz that's
[1:03:41] my daddy and I'm very jealous about my
[1:03:43] daddy because of what they do with his
[1:03:46] word and I don't mind telling you
[1:03:49] that you said but you said this about so
[1:03:51] and so but you don't know what they
[1:03:53] believe I go about what I know as much
[1:03:56] as I can
[1:03:58] know if you spend as much time defending
[1:04:01] the truth as you do defending lies we
[1:04:04] ain't got no
[1:04:08] problem sorry that's right that's
[1:04:12] exactly the way I
[1:04:14] stand see because to me this one that
[1:04:17] was as we read in verse
[1:04:20] 18 that this one that was in the bosom
[1:04:26] brings out the father right he don't
[1:04:29] bring out
[1:04:30] himself right oh man how many years have
[1:04:33] I been on it everybody says adoption we
[1:04:36] was back in the 60s and oh they was
[1:04:38] really going with adoption adoptions and
[1:04:41] boy one of these days we'll speak that
[1:04:43] word and it'll just create itself well I
[1:04:45] believe
[1:04:47] that I believe that I've seen it happen
[1:04:49] so I don't have to worry about it all
[1:04:51] right but see we want to make it
[1:04:54] something that way that we come into the
[1:04:57] view look what I done I was the one that
[1:05:02] said
[1:05:03] that you ever watch that you know like a
[1:05:05] lot of
[1:05:06] people my my my my me me me me my my
[1:05:12] my right we'll get in my car and we'll
[1:05:15] go down to my house and we'll go in my
[1:05:17] living room and we'll sit down on my
[1:05:19] couch and them M get you could set a
[1:05:21] whole lot more in between there without
[1:05:23] the m
[1:05:26] I'm not throwing off on anybody because
[1:05:27] I realize what Natures are you know what
[1:05:30] those Natures are is people that didn't
[1:05:31] have anything when they were young
[1:05:35] little and everything becomes
[1:05:37] mine I'm not against
[1:05:40] that not talking about anything I'm just
[1:05:42] talking about one
[1:05:46] thing if we put
[1:05:49] anything above this
[1:05:53] word something went
[1:05:57] wrong and then why is Lula spoken of as
[1:06:01] a word word word word word word people
[1:06:03] well what's the matter you don't want to
[1:06:10] word well you know I just don't agree
[1:06:14] with you like I said
[1:06:16] last a couple weeks
[1:06:20] ago if I tell you you're wrong I'm going
[1:06:22] to show you why that I'm saying
[1:06:26] that I'm not just going to say you're
[1:06:28] wrong and walk
[1:06:31] off but see you present something I
[1:06:34] don't agree with that brother Dale I
[1:06:35] think you're wrong well show me where
[1:06:36] I'm wrong cuz I want to be right
[1:06:39] right well you won't listen to me you
[1:06:41] ever tried
[1:06:46] it I don't agree with you well you know
[1:06:49] what if you don't agree with me you're
[1:06:50] supposed to come to me you're not
[1:06:52] supposed to explain to everybody else
[1:06:54] why you differ with
[1:06:56] me you're supposed to come to
[1:06:59] me and we can sit down and talk about
[1:07:02] it all
[1:07:05] right but
[1:07:09] look that only
[1:07:14] begotten all right now I can quote the
[1:07:17] prophet if you want it he said there was
[1:07:19] never another son begotten like that
[1:07:21] son all right are you with me right when
[1:07:24] it says the only begotten you got it
[1:07:26] twice there in what we've read about 14
[1:07:30] and
[1:07:31] 18 the only
[1:07:34] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:07:38] truth now that's got to be one true and
[1:07:42] living God or we've messed up
[1:07:46] somewhere in our Concepts our
[1:07:48] thoughts that's what listen I know and
[1:07:51] realize one thing for certain
[1:07:55] I know the human mind because I have
[1:08:00] one and I know that what you've been
[1:08:02] taught is still embedded in you and no
[1:08:06] matter what you do may I quote the
[1:08:08] Catholic Church they say give me a child
[1:08:12] right till it's what five 6 years old
[1:08:15] said you can have it the rest of your
[1:08:17] life now I differ with the new birth you
[1:08:21] know I I I differ with them that the New
[1:08:24] Birth can change things but I agree with
[1:08:26] them in the
[1:08:27] natural they may leave the Catholic
[1:08:30] church but they just go join a Baptist
[1:08:32] they go join another one they'll go join
[1:08:34] this or that because that's embedded
[1:08:36] into
[1:08:39] you this is your right hand you know say
[1:08:42] to people raise your right
[1:08:44] hand what you raise your right hand well
[1:08:46] if we're on the opposite side of the
[1:08:48] earth which hand you going to
[1:08:52] raise look at in the mirror raise your
[1:08:55] right
[1:08:57] hand turn around backwards and get you
[1:08:59] another mirror and look in the mirror
[1:09:00] which one going
[1:09:02] up oh you're silly that's what I'm
[1:09:04] talking about it's silly it's silly the
[1:09:07] way we think CU we don't take the Bible
[1:09:10] that's what it says right we don't take
[1:09:12] the prophet's message as to what it
[1:09:16] says we've got it already figured out
[1:09:21] and I Know It And I've been dealing with
[1:09:23] it for 50 years preaching that I cannot
[1:09:26] change none of your thoughts they will
[1:09:29] not change because of a weight of
[1:09:31] matter I I give 40 quotes for that that
[1:09:35] weighty of matter won't change
[1:09:37] you right it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:09:41] reveal
[1:09:42] it is that the prophet page 45 Christ
[1:09:46] mystery God reveal is that right or in
[1:09:48] future home one somewhere right in there
[1:09:50] it takes a Holy Holy Spirit the only
[1:09:52] revealer of the word the father
[1:09:55] right but said you don't believe in
[1:09:57] Father Son and Holy Ghost I Believe In
[1:09:59] Father Son and Holy Ghost that's what
[1:10:00] I'm trying to
[1:10:04] explain I believe it so much until when
[1:10:07] you say oh God was he poured into Christ
[1:10:10] I don't whack them out of space over
[1:10:11] here and leave it empty
[1:10:17] right I still got something when I get
[1:10:20] there I can talk to him about he can
[1:10:22] explain it to me right that's the way I
[1:10:25] see the
[1:10:28] father now you show me where father son
[1:10:30] Holy Ghost has ever done away
[1:10:33] with right did your memory
[1:10:36] click you see that's why I like to
[1:10:39] preach did your memory
[1:10:42] click that there'll be a time that his
[1:10:44] son will become
[1:10:49] subject does that subject to you mean
[1:10:51] the son's done away with
[1:10:57] that's the
[1:10:59] Bible that the son himself shall become
[1:11:01] subject that God may be all in
[1:11:06] all is that doing away with the
[1:11:10] son
[1:11:12] no it means
[1:11:16] his time our
[1:11:20] existence is
[1:11:22] finished not done away finished cuz he's
[1:11:27] no
[1:11:29] longer from the bosom trying to explain
[1:11:32] the
[1:11:34] Father the father himself has already
[1:11:37] come into being right that's
[1:11:40] right it does what me do away
[1:11:44] with am on that's why I like to preach
[1:11:48] see I like to get it when I know that
[1:11:50] your mind is rolling and you come up
[1:11:52] when I look at your eyes eyes in your
[1:11:54] eyes he don't know that and I say uh oh
[1:11:57] I do know that I just got through
[1:12:00] explaining that cuz you explain it some
[1:12:03] other
[1:12:06] way and you're going to have him
[1:12:08] contrary to what is it uh Malachi 3 and
[1:12:12] 6 is that the one where he said I'm God
[1:12:13] and I change not are you going to be
[1:12:15] with Hebrews 13:8 same yesterday today
[1:12:17] and forever so whatever he is what was
[1:12:19] our life's messages I'll get a second on
[1:12:21] it what was it all the at attributes we
[1:12:24] showed you the video come come and put
[1:12:25] that up Brothers you know of what we've
[1:12:27] been doing that all the attributes God
[1:12:31] had him
[1:12:33] before he ever come into this world as a
[1:12:36] creation or Creator and the prophet
[1:12:39] would use that statement which is you
[1:12:41] know mindboggling to the human mind he
[1:12:43] said in the beginning but before the
[1:12:46] Eternal you can't even think that way
[1:12:50] that ain't all of the quotes that's just
[1:12:52] open enough p pull up the little drawing
[1:12:54] brother that we made all the attributes
[1:12:58] that God ever will have was in him
[1:13:01] before the world or else he changed
[1:13:06] somewhere right he didn't gain
[1:13:09] attributes over on this side he
[1:13:10] displayed
[1:13:12] attributes well that's what I can't
[1:13:14] understand well then you need to pray
[1:13:17] because I wasn't the one if you want the
[1:13:19] quotes we'll go pick up this afternoon
[1:13:21] on this point right here
[1:13:24] the attributes is Father Son and Holy
[1:13:26] Ghost there's only three attributes of
[1:13:28] God okay now all of these attributes
[1:13:30] here has to deal with Father Son and
[1:13:32] Holy Ghost okay no problem right because
[1:13:35] there's only three attributes Father Son
[1:13:37] and Holy Ghost I didn't bring that
[1:13:38] because that's sensible you ought to
[1:13:39] know but what about before the world in
[1:13:42] his mind and his thinking and his
[1:13:44] attribute which is part of him he was
[1:13:46] already a father no no no no there was
[1:13:49] nothing back there see that's where
[1:13:51] you're tying it up let me let me read
[1:13:53] what
[1:13:56] WR you see you are
[1:13:59] thinking that he has the ability to
[1:14:02] become
[1:14:03] something that's what you're thinking
[1:14:05] you're thinking he's back here with the
[1:14:08] ability to become
[1:14:12] something I differ with you 100%
[1:14:17] right cuz the prophet said he had all
[1:14:19] these attributes in
[1:14:22] him right
[1:14:25] but I just don't understand that I can't
[1:14:27] figure that out brother d i i kind of
[1:14:29] comprehend father and I kind of get
[1:14:30] along with these and these and these and
[1:14:32] the it's hard to do with the Christ but
[1:14:33] sure it's hard to do with the son cuz
[1:14:35] that look like Eternal
[1:14:37] sunship no it's not if you understand
[1:14:39] the
[1:14:41] word there's no such thing as Eternal
[1:14:43] sunship but there's an eternal
[1:14:48] God did Jesus have eternal life
[1:14:55] I thought we read in John where it says
[1:14:57] and the life was in
[1:15:02] him what are you
[1:15:06] thinking see you are thinking that he
[1:15:09] has the ability to become these
[1:15:12] attributes you're not thinking the way I
[1:15:14] am that these attributes was already in
[1:15:22] him
[1:15:23] I thought we believe that every Apple
[1:15:25] that would ever be on a tree was in the
[1:15:27] seed when it went in the
[1:15:31] ground right that's right if not where'd
[1:15:34] it come from
[1:15:36] right I thought that all three of my
[1:15:39] children was in
[1:15:42] me in a seed germ
[1:15:45] form and the DNA would prove that that
[1:15:49] they were there when I was
[1:15:52] born that's right no no now you finally
[1:15:56] become see that's that's what I
[1:16:00] mean you're thinking that he has the
[1:16:03] ability to be able to be these things
[1:16:06] the prophet is explaining that he had
[1:16:08] these things within him
[1:16:13] right but they were not
[1:16:17] displayed that's right but they were in
[1:16:19] him or else he changed somewhere
[1:16:25] now you see the seriousness where you're
[1:16:30] at but I don't understand that
[1:16:35] son well you need to understand where it
[1:16:38] over there you remember when he looked
[1:16:39] down into the furnace and he said we
[1:16:41] throw three in there but said the one
[1:16:43] that I see down there is like the Son of
[1:16:47] God you know that King didn't have no
[1:16:49] problem saying
[1:16:51] that right
[1:16:53] well see we think of
[1:16:55] son as beginning all right let me get
[1:16:57] just a
[1:16:59] second all of his
[1:17:02] attributes when they come over on the
[1:17:04] other side they can be expressed now
[1:17:07] because there was no ability back here
[1:17:08] to be expressed so now he has the
[1:17:11] ability when you become on over into the
[1:17:14] creation etc etc he has the ability to
[1:17:16] start displaying his attributes but you
[1:17:19] can't display more over there than you
[1:17:20] do over here or more over here than you
[1:17:22] do over there
[1:17:25] right that's why when I sum these up see
[1:17:27] all of this summing up means
[1:17:31] speech or
[1:17:37] word all of
[1:17:39] these comes down to be word where he
[1:17:42] said let thy
[1:17:44] be
[1:17:47] right any problems within the
[1:17:52] scriptures
[1:17:55] that all things were created by Him who
[1:17:58] the
[1:18:00] word
[1:18:02] right let me get these real fast let's
[1:18:05] read the Bible and see about this
[1:18:07] Creator we'll get to it this afternoon
[1:18:11] more we'll go to I've got them in order
[1:18:14] for them to bring them but we'll run it
[1:18:16] up run it up to uh Ephesians 3 and9 but
[1:18:20] go ahead and bring up to the the
[1:18:23] scriptures
[1:18:24] Brother
[1:18:26] Anderson you know that I gave to you all
[1:18:29] right but Ephesians 3:9 says and to all
[1:18:33] to make all men see what is the glory I
[1:18:36] mean what is the Fellowship of the
[1:18:38] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:18:40] world hath been hid in God which created
[1:18:43] All Things by Jesus Christ right now we
[1:18:48] know Jesus the flesh was not back there
[1:18:51] that's sensible right right right
[1:18:53] but you know that's where your mind
[1:18:55] hangs anytime you say Jesus you say
[1:19:00] flesh I thought Jesus was the only name
[1:19:03] God ever had
[1:19:05] right am I right is that the way your
[1:19:08] Prophet explains
[1:19:11] it that Jesus is the only name God ever
[1:19:14] had all right see then he's not saying
[1:19:17] that all things were created by Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ the flesh man standing back there
[1:19:23] who was back there the Christ and who
[1:19:26] was that
[1:19:28] Christ the name Jesus had not come into
[1:19:31] being at that time but did he not have
[1:19:34] no
[1:19:35] name you had a no name God until you got
[1:19:37] over to where the scripture said and
[1:19:39] you'll call his name
[1:19:42] Jesus now come on you're getting all
[1:19:45] messed
[1:19:46] up but see if all things were created by
[1:19:49] Jesus Christ then you're right when
[1:19:51] Peter when Jes Jesus asked Peter he said
[1:19:54] who the man say I the son of man am
[1:19:58] Matthew what it
[1:20:03] 16:13 now he asked him who was the son
[1:20:05] of
[1:20:06] man Peter didn't understand him because
[1:20:09] that was a
[1:20:10] mystery but he did understand one thing
[1:20:13] because watch what he said Thou Art the
[1:20:16] Christ the son of the Living
[1:20:19] God right amen that's right right
[1:20:26] you are the Creator
[1:20:29] right cuz who else done the Crea oh the
[1:20:32] father did we'll get to it this evening
[1:20:34] where brother R says the father didn't
[1:20:36] do it the son
[1:20:37] created you going to say well the father
[1:20:39] had it in his mind let's read where the
[1:20:41] Prophet said the son had in his mind
[1:20:43] what to
[1:20:45] do you see I love
[1:20:48] it I love it you may not like it at all
[1:20:51] but I do I love the word of God go back
[1:20:54] now let's go to we done been with John
[1:20:56] and what did we get in John we got in
[1:20:59] John 1:3 so jump back up to there and
[1:21:01] we'll start reading then we'll quit all
[1:21:03] right John
[1:21:04] 1:3 or
[1:21:07] 1:1 and all things were made now this
[1:21:10] beginning this word this person and all
[1:21:14] things were made by him and without him
[1:21:16] was not anything made that was
[1:21:20] made so then half dozen creators
[1:21:24] got
[1:21:25] one put this an end look at First
[1:21:27] Corinthians look at the next one 1
[1:21:29] Corinthians 8 and6 that's what I said a
[1:21:31] lot of scriptures we just don't use all
[1:21:33] of them but to us there is but one
[1:21:36] God the father of whom are all things
[1:21:41] and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:44] oh there's
[1:21:47] two by whom all things are all things
[1:21:52] and we by
[1:21:54] him so remember we'll get to it
[1:21:57] eventually he created us that's right we
[1:22:01] doesn't create him all right look at
[1:22:04] Colossians we've used Ephesians look at
[1:22:06] Colossians Colossians 1:16 who is the
[1:22:08] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[1:22:11] of every creature for by him were all
[1:22:13] things created what first born of every
[1:22:16] creature the only begotten right that we
[1:22:18] still with the
[1:22:19] scripture that are for by him we're all
[1:22:22] things created that are in heaven and
[1:22:25] that are in Earth visible and invisible
[1:22:28] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:22:30] principalities or Powers so the devil
[1:22:33] had to have a beginning didn't he all
[1:22:35] things were created by Him and for him
[1:22:37] and he is before all things and by him
[1:22:41] all things
[1:22:43] consist right look at the next one
[1:22:46] Hebrews
[1:22:48] one God who at Su times and in diverse
[1:22:51] manner spake in times pist unto the
[1:22:53] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[1:22:55] last days spoken unto us by his son the
[1:22:58] original says in his son whom he hath
[1:23:01] appointed air of all things but whom
[1:23:03] also he made the
[1:23:06] worlds all right look at the next one
[1:23:09] Revelations
[1:23:11] 4:10 the 4 and20 Elders fall down and
[1:23:14] who is this one the kinsman redeemer the
[1:23:16] 4 and20 Elders who Jesus Christ right
[1:23:18] around the throne what he's sitting on
[1:23:20] the throne Jesus Christ before him that
[1:23:22] sat on the throne and worship him that
[1:23:24] liveth forever and ever and cast their
[1:23:26] crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art
[1:23:28] Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and
[1:23:30] honor and power for thou Hast created
[1:23:32] all things and for thy pleasure they are
[1:23:35] and were
[1:23:37] created look at the next one Psalms 33
[1:23:40] and
[1:23:43] 6 by the word of the Lord speech Lord
[1:23:47] God speech word in the beginning was the
[1:23:50] word word with God and the Word was God
[1:23:51] all right by the word of the Lord were
[1:23:54] the heavens
[1:23:56] made and all the host of them by the
[1:23:59] breath of his
[1:24:02] mouth that's good
[1:24:06] right think about
[1:24:08] it there can't be but one
[1:24:12] Creator there can't be but one God amen
[1:24:18] amen they can't be but one savior they
[1:24:21] can't be but one Healer can't be we're
[1:24:23] quick to let him be healer we're quick
[1:24:25] to let him be savior but we don't want
[1:24:26] let him be
[1:24:28] God well that's contrary to the Bible
[1:24:31] come on musicians think about it what do
[1:24:34] you think about one
[1:24:40] God well there you know got
[1:24:43] to well what do you think about
[1:24:46] it the great Creator became my savior as
[1:24:49] we s and all God's fullness dwell in
[1:24:55] him out of the bosom of the
[1:25:00] Father the heart the very being of God
[1:25:04] come into
[1:25:10] being right and he created all things
[1:25:14] now we're going to get to it so before
[1:25:16] you get to it this evening let me uh
[1:25:18] click this because I like to do this I
[1:25:20] know I'm dirty but I like to do it when
[1:25:22] we get into talking about the coming
[1:25:25] into existence of the sun you're going
[1:25:28] to automatically say 2,000 years ago
[1:25:30] when your Prophet is automatically
[1:25:31] talking about before the
[1:25:33] world so before you get started I warn
[1:25:35] you don't let your little computer
[1:25:38] go but he just don't understand cuz that
[1:25:41] was
[1:25:42] after whatever he is now he has always
[1:25:46] been and will forever be
[1:25:49] that he said I'm God and I change not
[1:25:56] right so if you don't change why do we
[1:25:58] want to
[1:26:01] change you say yeah but brother Dale we
[1:26:05] think we we've been taught the TR that
[1:26:07] the son created yeah but the father
[1:26:09] created
[1:26:12] him well then if he created him he can't
[1:26:15] be Eternal come
[1:26:18] on the way we use the word create cannot
[1:26:22] be
[1:26:23] Eternal so then you got your scriptures
[1:26:25] messed up let's Stand Together think on
[1:26:28] these
[1:26:30] things what is your thoughts of one
[1:26:33] God well brother de I have to admit I
[1:26:35] never thought about what you said well
[1:26:37] then maybe you want to sit down and
[1:26:38] think about it I mean that's really the
[1:26:39] reason I said
[1:26:42] it a trinitarian don't have a bit of
[1:26:44] trouble with a father over here and a
[1:26:46] son over here and a church over here and
[1:26:49] and just all kind of manifestations that
[1:26:51] have a bit trouble with that
[1:26:55] right is that true that's true the oness
[1:26:59] their problem is that they can only go
[1:27:00] so
[1:27:01] far see they just pick up everything
[1:27:03] move it over to here and they'll say
[1:27:06] Jesus was almighty
[1:27:09] god well that's
[1:27:13] true but then when you say let us they
[1:27:16] don't like
[1:27:18] that but when you say there's one
[1:27:20] sitting on the throne they like that
[1:27:24] that's their
[1:27:25] Doctrine but do you have trouble with
[1:27:28] that you have trouble with it saying let
[1:27:31] us make man do you know that I can show
[1:27:33] you where brother Bram said that he was
[1:27:35] even just talking to the animals if you
[1:27:37] remember
[1:27:39] that the animals are created for we were
[1:27:42] he's talking to animals how he's going
[1:27:44] to create
[1:27:45] us but yeah we got to get it
[1:27:50] all we had a message go ahead brother
[1:27:53] 188 spiral book 188 one true and living
[1:27:59] God from his
[1:28:04] glory ever
[1:28:07] living you have a need the altar is
[1:28:10] open my God
[1:28:15] and and Jesus was his
[1:28:21] name
[1:28:23] morning
[1:28:28] M
[1:28:34] Str why do we have to make the Bible say
[1:28:39] what we wanted to say why can't we say
[1:28:41] what it
[1:28:51] says
[1:28:53] for my
[1:28:58] bre My All In
[1:29:04] All the
[1:29:09] great
[1:29:11] became
[1:29:14] my and oh God what about it you have a
[1:29:18] need he's still the Healer
[1:29:23] if he ever healed anybody he's still a
[1:29:25] Healer ever saved anybody he's still a
[1:29:31] savior he ever was the word he still is
[1:29:34] the
[1:29:38] word and the word come to the prophet is
[1:29:41] that
[1:29:46] Bible God gracious
[1:29:50] tender
[1:29:53] he didn't become God when he got on this
[1:29:56] side he said but God is an to
[1:30:00] worship he already had that within
[1:30:04] him he displayed
[1:30:10] it he said let us make man in her own
[1:30:13] image then whatever image now listen
[1:30:16] this is where you're missing it
[1:30:19] my whatever image
[1:30:22] the man is is the same image of God is
[1:30:26] or you missed your
[1:30:30] language so if we find out what he was
[1:30:34] that's what he still is if we find out
[1:30:36] what he is that's what he
[1:30:46] was but you see we think well we
[1:30:49] understand it because God is an object
[1:30:51] of worship and created angels
