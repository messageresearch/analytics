[2:49] you know god said he would

[3:55] then we'll go to genesis 2. let's bow
[3:58] our heads before we get started
[4:00] heavenly father we pray tonight that
[4:03] you would be the active participant in
[4:05] this service
[4:06] but you would not be a bystander lord
[4:08] recording our thoughts and our ideas of
[4:10] our
[4:11] old natural adamic ways but lord that
[4:14] you would just break through all that
[4:16] lord just take the spiritual eye and the
[4:18] spiritual ear and the spiritual mouth
[4:20] and may we all connect tonight may they
[4:23] be a oneness father like you said in the
[4:25] garden
[4:26] that you and adam and eve was true
[4:28] oneness where man could walk in front of
[4:31] you father and and be able to converse
[4:33] with you and lord we know that was lost
[4:36] in the fall and we know that there was a
[4:38] chasm there that man could not get back
[4:40] to
[4:40] but now we see that that chasm has been
[4:42] drawn together by jesus christ
[4:45] and he is the way for us to get back to
[4:47] that tree
[4:48] and lord we pray that you would just
[4:50] bless us now give us a good service
[4:52] tonight father just keep us strong and
[4:55] healthy be with the ones that are on the
[4:57] foreign fields lord the missionaries you
[4:59] bless them and give them fruit for their
[5:01] labor father
[5:02] bless this day lord take care of us
[5:04] bless the sick that are among us and the
[5:06] ones that are not here lord for many
[5:08] reasons the ones that are watching in
[5:09] father we ask that you would just come
[5:11] down and bless each one father
[5:13] just be with us now take care of us
[5:15] we give it all to you father in jesus
[5:17] name amen
[5:18] genesis 1 26 and 27
[5:21] the bible says and god said now i was
[5:24] i
[5:26] as you preach this it just keeps
[5:28] unfolding
[5:29] because and god said
[5:31] so nobody this is not secondhand
[5:33] information this is not coming from a
[5:35] son that heard it from a father right
[5:37] that's right
[5:38] god said amen
[5:40] let us make man in our image after our
[5:42] likeness so you know what god must be a
[5:44] man amen
[5:47] exactly if we're a man
[5:49] and we were made in his image
[5:51] then he must be a man amen
[5:53] and actually he's the only man there
[5:55] ever was
[5:57] the only complete man there ever was
[5:59] and then you and i were made in his
[6:02] image after our likeness and let them so
[6:04] there's plurality there
[6:06] that has come into being let them have
[6:09] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[6:11] over the fowl of the air and over the
[6:12] cattle and over all the earth not just
[6:15] certain elements not just certain
[6:17] continents not just certain things all
[6:19] the earth so whatever this group of
[6:21] people is because it is plural it says
[6:23] them
[6:26] right right
[6:27] they have control of the earth
[6:30] all right and over every creeping thing
[6:31] that creepeth upon the earth so god
[6:33] created man in his own image now not as
[6:36] far as we see as created as far as there
[6:39] was nothing and then there's something
[6:42] amen right because cars were in genesis
[6:46] that's right television was in the
[6:48] garden of eden
[6:52] where do you think everything came from
[6:54] right right this earth that's why they
[6:56] call it mother earth
[6:57] everything comes from the earth the
[6:58] bible says there's nothing new under the
[7:00] sun it's just that man had not been able
[7:02] to take the elements and put them
[7:05] together to build the car because the
[7:06] car physically comes from the dirt
[7:10] where do you think it comes from it
[7:12] comes from the dirt so the dirt was in
[7:13] the garden of eden so there's nothing
[7:15] new so god created in other words in
[7:18] other words he fashioned something
[7:20] before the foundation of the world and
[7:22] god created in his own image
[7:24] created man in the image of god created
[7:26] he him
[7:27] male and female created he them so god
[7:30] had a purpose that there was going to be
[7:31] a man and a woman
[7:34] all right
[7:35] but now look verse 28
[7:39] whatever group of people this is
[7:42] was blessed before they got here that's
[7:45] right right
[7:47] if we believe god who's who he is and
[7:48] can't change his mind god can't have a
[7:50] better thought two thousand years from
[7:52] now right god's thoughts are eternal
[7:55] everything he thinks and everything he
[7:56] says happens
[7:58] not like human beings but god blessed
[8:00] them so whoever that group of people is
[8:02] is already blessed amen right all right
[8:05] and god blessed them and god said unto
[8:07] them in other words he spoke straight to
[8:09] this
[8:10] group of people
[8:11] right
[8:12] okay them
[8:14] all right now we know it wasn't a group
[8:15] of people before the foundation of the
[8:17] world we're not we're not mormons that
[8:19] believe that we were all up there
[8:21] somewhere because this is probably the
[8:23] scripture that they get it from but we
[8:25] were not we were there in the form of
[8:28] god
[8:31] that was
[8:32] eternal
[8:34] but it was not you go to galatians 3 16
[8:37] the bible says not as unto seeds as of
[8:39] many which these are seeds of many
[8:42] but one seed which is christ all right
[8:44] so god blessed them and god said unto
[8:46] them be fruitful
[8:48] and multiply right
[8:50] now we went through all that a couple
[8:51] weeks ago told you all the definitions
[8:54] of multiply and replenish the earth
[8:57] and subdue it so in other words whatever
[8:59] this group of people is the earth is
[9:01] theirs right right amen
[9:02] complete control
[9:04] of the earth all right
[9:06] and have dominion over the fish of the
[9:08] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[9:10] over every living thing that moveth upon
[9:12] the earth you may be seated in the lord
[9:14] that is blessing to the reading of the
[9:15] word but tonight we're going to speak
[9:17] on part 3 genesis 1 26 part 3 the tree
[9:20] of life all right because there was
[9:24] in genesis 2 if you'll read genesis 2
[9:27] verse 9.
[9:29] now i want you to watch something here
[9:33] what's your punctuation you say oh that
[9:35] doesn't mean anything yeah it does or
[9:36] they wouldn't be there right all right
[9:39] and out of the ground made the lord god
[9:41] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[9:43] the sight and good for food
[9:46] pause
[9:48] pause
[9:51] the tree of life also in the midst of
[9:52] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[9:54] good and evil now god didn't cause them
[9:56] to come out of the ground
[9:58] right
[10:00] pause
[10:01] he created the trees
[10:03] then paul's
[10:05] the writer of this is moses we know that
[10:07] for a surety right all right so moses is
[10:10] seeing a vision he's seeing a vision of
[10:13] two things in the garden that is not
[10:15] necessarily trees because when they
[10:18] start eating off of these trees there's
[10:19] some funny things happening if it's just
[10:22] regular fruit
[10:23] like apples and oranges and pears and
[10:26] pomegranates
[10:27] and apricots
[10:29] i like apricots but that had nothing to
[10:31] do with what was going on here
[10:34] in verse 16. now look at 16-17 and the
[10:37] lord god commanded the man saying of
[10:39] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[10:41] freely eat
[10:43] that's right
[10:44] pay attention
[10:46] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[10:49] evil funny tree
[10:51] you see one today
[10:53] no
[10:55] okay
[10:56] they call it a metaphor they call it a
[10:58] uh something and jesus said thank you
[11:00] god for hiding this from the wise and
[11:02] prudent it takes the holy ghost to bring
[11:05] all these things to our
[11:07] vision to show us the same thing moses
[11:09] saw right right
[11:11] if moses wrote it by the holy ghost
[11:14] and we have the holy ghost amen
[11:18] it's not two holy ghosts right we're
[11:20] gonna prove something tonight all right
[11:22] that we've been looking at this tree of
[11:24] life as something
[11:25] out yonder somewhere or something we
[11:27] must go to to get and i'm going to let
[11:30] the prophet bring it right down to you
[11:32] which we believe that in the end time
[11:34] that god did send the prophet no no you
[11:36] say that's bad that's not good well he
[11:39] sent paul he sent peter he sent john he
[11:42] sent james he sent uh john smith to the
[11:45] baptist yeah right
[11:47] so
[11:48] you say well we don't we fought we don't
[11:50] follow no man yeah you follow somebody
[11:53] somebody you follow i don't care who it
[11:56] is
[11:56] if you're catholic you follow the pope
[11:59] right
[12:00] if you're methodist you follow the
[12:02] method way of
[12:04] of worshiping which was john wesley he
[12:07] created the method that's why it's
[12:09] called methodist he created a method of
[12:12] worship all right now luther and
[12:14] lutheranism now martin luther probably
[12:18] would
[12:18] would throw up at the lutheranism today
[12:22] but true lutheranism was that just shall
[12:24] live by faith it wasn't penance it
[12:26] wasn't something that you do or don't do
[12:28] it's the just shall live by the faith of
[12:30] god
[12:31] all right so that was a revelation for
[12:32] him but we come here in the end time and
[12:34] we see that that all that got scrupled
[12:37] up and something had to come and bring
[12:38] it
[12:39] bring all the loose ends in other words
[12:41] back together again that we can see that
[12:45] you take this bible and and
[12:47] you know we say catholicism is the great
[12:49] and and the the baptist and the
[12:52] methodists or the are the daughters to
[12:54] the and
[12:55] but they get their they get their
[12:57] sermons and they get their quotes and
[12:59] they get their denominational ideas
[13:01] straight from the bible that's right
[13:03] that's right
[13:04] i don't get it from anywhere else they
[13:05] get it straight from the bible
[13:07] all right so
[13:08] misinterpreted theology has caused a lot
[13:10] of people to see things a little bit
[13:14] different but tonight we want to look at
[13:15] this and we want to see and break some
[13:17] of these words down
[13:19] because look the lord god commanded the
[13:21] man saying of every tree of the garden
[13:22] thou mayest freely eat
[13:25] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[13:27] evil thou shalt not eat for in the day
[13:29] that thou eat thereof thou shalt die now
[13:31] god never told him not to eat from the
[13:33] tree of life right that's right exactly
[13:35] that's right
[13:36] he never said don't eat from two trees
[13:40] he said just don't eat from that one
[13:41] tree
[13:43] in other words what does the word eat
[13:44] mean partake right
[13:47] so don't partake of that tree all right
[13:50] and you'll be all right but we know what
[13:51] happened now in genesis 3
[13:53] let's read a few scriptures and then
[13:55] we'll get started genesis 3
[13:58] and the lord god said behold
[14:01] the man is one of us become one of us
[14:03] now this is after
[14:06] what happened in the garden this is
[14:07] after the fall
[14:09] god is saying behold the man has become
[14:12] as one of us
[14:13] to know good and evil now lest he put
[14:16] forth his hand and take also of the tree
[14:18] of life now remember he ate of the tree
[14:20] of knowledge of good and evil
[14:23] right right
[14:25] but he didn't eat the tree of life
[14:29] but god said now if we don't stop
[14:34] he's going to try to go eat that tree of
[14:35] life right all right but he's already
[14:38] perverted
[14:40] that's the problem he had already messed
[14:42] it up or he could have went to the tree
[14:45] of life because god never tells them do
[14:47] not eat from the tree of life
[14:49] he tells them don't eat from the tree of
[14:51] knowledge of good and evil all right and
[14:53] the lord god said behold the man has
[14:54] become one of us to know good and evil
[14:57] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[14:58] take also of the tree of life and eat
[15:02] or partake right all right and live
[15:05] forever right
[15:07] now remember this tree of knowledge of
[15:09] good and evil
[15:10] the day you eat there of the day you die
[15:13] now the tree of life
[15:15] let's just assume that that's the tree
[15:17] of life
[15:19] life
[15:20] eternal life
[15:24] because there was good and evil
[15:26] in the garden all right so let's just
[15:29] let's don't say let's assume let's just
[15:30] know that that there was something that
[15:32] adam and eve was going to come to
[15:34] eventually
[15:36] from that tree of life if they would
[15:38] have left that tree of knowledge of good
[15:39] and evil alone now you say well were
[15:42] those trees
[15:43] absolutely not
[15:45] no
[15:47] they weren't a maple or an elm or an oak
[15:50] or a pecan or
[15:54] tree is going to do you any good
[15:59] because god said in a later
[16:01] verse he said
[16:03] i see man as trees you remember the man
[16:06] that had his eyes open you know
[16:08] he said i see men as trees and then then
[16:10] there's a a tree and i'll i'll i didn't
[16:13] know this until i read it but uh
[16:17] the tree of life is mentioned three
[16:20] times in genesis and three times in
[16:22] revelation
[16:24] so there's three times in genesis and
[16:26] three times in revelation so there must
[16:27] be something to this tree of life
[16:30] if we know that genesis is the beginning
[16:33] everything comes out of genesis and then
[16:35] revelations is the ending of all things
[16:37] all right so there's something that god
[16:39] wants us to look at so genesis 3
[16:42] 23 says therefore the lord god sent him
[16:44] forth from the garden of eden to till
[16:46] the ground from which he was taken
[16:48] so he drove out the man and he placed in
[16:51] the east of the garden of eden cherubims
[16:53] and a flaming sword which turned every
[16:55] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[17:01] so there must be a way
[17:03] to the tree of life
[17:07] this is just simple english
[17:09] if there if he's now if there's
[17:11] something happened to man and he can't
[17:13] get to the tree of life yet there's a
[17:15] way to it and the cherubims are stopping
[17:17] the way
[17:18] there was a way there
[17:20] for him to come to the tree of life all
[17:23] right so he drove out the man and he
[17:25] placed at the east of garden
[17:27] eden of eden cherubims and the flaming
[17:30] sword was turned every way to keep the
[17:32] way of the tree of life
[17:35] now let's read in revelations 2 let's
[17:36] get the scriptures here that we want to
[17:39] out of the way this is one of them and
[17:40] we're going to speak of the other two
[17:41] later on
[17:44] but i want you to keep something in your
[17:45] mind tonight you remember when we went
[17:47] through genesis 1 26 and we took all the
[17:49] to me and to to you i know you believe
[17:52] it that that this is the characteristics
[17:54] of god this is the the dna of god
[17:57] because it's how god looks because
[17:59] that's the first thing he said we're
[18:01] made in his image we're made in his
[18:03] likeness he's given us dominion over the
[18:05] fish of the sea and the fowl of the air
[18:06] he's given us control over everything
[18:08] adam had complete control over the earth
[18:11] in other words in layman turns god said
[18:12] look i'll take care of heaven adam you
[18:16] take care of earth amen that's right
[18:18] just as simple as that i'll be the big g
[18:20] and you be the little jesus
[18:23] amen
[18:25] because it says ye are gods
[18:27] in the bible not a big g
[18:29] but now this big jesus been talking he's
[18:31] a big g right he's a big god
[18:34] but he wants us to be
[18:35] little gods
[18:38] okay he the health and here let him hear
[18:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[18:41] now this is in the ephesian church age
[18:44] the first church age all right
[18:46] so the first church age to him that
[18:48] overcometh will i give to eat of the
[18:50] tree of life which is in the midst of
[18:52] the paradise of god
[18:54] all right so it's moved from
[18:56] being exactly where it is in eden it's
[18:59] moved to somewhere where somebody can
[19:00] partake of it right because ephesians it
[19:03] says if you overcome i'll give you to
[19:06] eat of the tree of life so there must
[19:07] have been a way made to get back to it
[19:09] somewhere in there from genesis to
[19:12] revelations there was a way made
[19:14] somewhere for us to get back to the tree
[19:16] of life all right
[19:18] so now
[19:19] i want us to read uh in the ephesian
[19:22] church age
[19:24] out of the
[19:25] churches book
[19:27] or the rep this is the this is the
[19:29] individual books
[19:30] all right
[19:31] and let's see what brother ryan said
[19:32] summary of ephesus
[19:34] fruits without love led to apostasy the
[19:36] promises paradise promised to the
[19:38] overcomer of the saints of ephesus and
[19:40] the church aids given to the tree of
[19:41] life
[19:43] here's a beautiful thing the tree of
[19:44] life is mentioned three times in genesis
[19:47] three times in revelations the first
[19:49] time it was mentioned in genesis was in
[19:51] eden and christ was the tree
[19:55] so there's your key it wasn't a tree in
[19:58] the ground it was a man
[20:05] we've been through this
[20:07] glory the first time it was mentioned in
[20:08] genesis was in eden and christ was the
[20:10] tree the three times it was mentioned in
[20:12] revelations was christ in paradise
[20:15] oh that's rich the lord bless so from
[20:18] genesis to revelations there's three
[20:20] times mentioned the tree of life three
[20:22] times mentioned in the end of the bible
[20:24] but remember the first three times in in
[20:26] the beginning of the bible there's a way
[20:29] been stopped
[20:30] to get to that tree
[20:32] in the book of revelations whoever is
[20:34] overcoming is going straight to the tree
[20:36] of life all right and then the ephesian
[20:38] church age remember started right after
[20:40] pentecost
[20:42] so there's another key i want us to look
[20:45] at these characteristics of this tree of
[20:48] life this is what i was was thinking
[20:50] about when when dad was preaching it the
[20:52] other day and and we put that tree of
[20:54] life we said well it's jesus and it's
[20:56] and and we know it's him and and you
[20:58] know he's the way and he's the truth and
[21:00] the life and he's the one to get back to
[21:03] but remember
[21:05] there's one thing that's got to happen
[21:08] is he's got to be somewhere
[21:12] listen he's got to be somewhere doing
[21:15] the work
[21:18] not waiting to calvary to get here we
[21:20] know he was a lamb slain before the
[21:21] foundation in the world but i'm going to
[21:23] read you something that you've probably
[21:24] how many of you re read christ the
[21:26] mystery guard reveal 25 or 30 times at
[21:29] least read something the other day that
[21:31] i'd never seen before
[21:34] never happened to you right
[21:37] didn't think i thought it was
[21:39] but it did it just it just stuck out in
[21:41] my head and i'm like
[21:42] wow couldn't have said it no other way
[21:45] now let's read
[21:47] the next quote and just kind of
[21:49] break this down a little bit
[21:53] and take it
[21:55] from the bible because remember like i
[21:57] said before the bible was written
[22:00] jesus said thank you father
[22:02] that you have hid this from the wise and
[22:04] prudent and revealed it to babes such as
[22:06] would learn the tree of knowledge of
[22:08] good and evil you'll not learn anything
[22:10] but man's knowledge
[22:12] it will take you nowhere but death
[22:15] literally you and i come off the tree of
[22:17] knowledge of good and evil
[22:22] because adam and eve took of that
[22:25] and that's where we came from
[22:27] they did not partake of the tree of life
[22:29] at first right that's right okay so
[22:31] there's another key all right
[22:33] because we're going to look at this
[22:34] characteristics of the tree of life i've
[22:36] been looking at that now instead of just
[22:38] just looking at words and looking at
[22:39] phrases and looking at genesis 1 26 look
[22:42] at the characteristic of what that is
[22:46] all right i want to look at the
[22:47] characteristic tonight of the tree of
[22:49] life
[22:50] we say well the tree of life was jesus
[22:52] well let's hang on just a minute
[22:55] jesus the flesh wasn't in the garden
[22:59] yet brother branham here says i'll read
[23:01] it to you in just a minute he says the
[23:02] tree of life was jesus
[23:05] but now remember it wasn't jesus in
[23:07] flesh standing back there in the garden
[23:09] of eden
[23:10] but remember
[23:12] hebrews 13 8
[23:14] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[23:18] and forever
[23:19] that which was which is and which is to
[23:21] come all right the almighty so now let's
[23:25] get into this a little bit
[23:27] i want to break a couple of words down
[23:30] just for
[23:31] reference
[23:34] let's read god's provided way of worship
[23:36] 1953
[23:38] now in the garden of eden there were two
[23:39] trees
[23:40] one of them was a tree of knowledge
[23:43] one was the tree of life
[23:45] and man can never know god by knowledge
[23:48] so no matter how well you get educated
[23:50] how smart your pastor is exactly
[23:54] how many degrees he's taken which we
[23:56] know he didn't he didn't get a high
[23:57] school degree
[23:59] talk about brother branham and we're
[24:00] talking about our pastor here he got ged
[24:03] later on but what i'm saying is there
[24:05] the ministry of this church is not built
[24:07] on phds and
[24:09] and and how much we can how much we can
[24:12] quote the bible and how much we can
[24:14] quote it backwards to make it say
[24:16] something different but it is a love
[24:17] letter from god glory and the love
[24:20] letter from god we can read that love
[24:22] letter between the lines but it's got to
[24:25] compare with all the line and that's
[24:26] what we're going to try to show this
[24:28] afternoon or this evening so now the
[24:30] garden of eden one was a tree of life
[24:32] and man can never know god by knowledge
[24:34] so no matter how well you get educated
[24:36] how smart your pastor is how many
[24:37] decrees degrees he's taken you can't god
[24:40] is not known by education
[24:42] now you say well
[24:44] how can you
[24:45] prove that
[24:47] peter couldn't write his name right
[24:48] right
[24:50] peter could not write his name when he
[24:53] signed his fishing report on friday he
[24:56] put an x
[25:02] but yet god used him for the spokesman
[25:04] on the day of pentecost to preach the
[25:06] very first sermon from a holy ghost
[25:09] filled man
[25:11] so it's not knowledge
[25:13] peter walks up to the guy at the gate
[25:15] beautiful and he said silver and gold
[25:17] have i none
[25:18] in other words my fishing ain't doing
[25:20] very well right now
[25:22] i ain't even got no money
[25:24] but such as i have
[25:26] i give unto you it wasn't something he
[25:28] could reach in his pocket and get it was
[25:30] something that peter came with on the
[25:33] day of pentecost that came to him
[25:36] and he accepted it and that's the way
[25:37] you and i
[25:38] the same way we received the new birth
[25:40] the same way they received the new birth
[25:43] on the day of pentecost all right
[25:46] god is not known by education neither
[25:47] he's known by scientific research the
[25:49] only way god is known is by faith
[25:53] no matter if you don't know the
[25:54] difference between split beans and
[25:56] coffee
[25:58] now most of us do
[26:00] but if you absolutely by faith except
[26:03] god it's bound to be an act of faith
[26:06] and when man was eating on this tree of
[26:08] life he had eternal life all right
[26:12] because he was heading toward something
[26:15] now remember
[26:16] adam's body was not eternal right
[26:19] okay adam's soul was eternal all right
[26:22] he was given the newborn he was it's not
[26:24] a new birth he was given the holy ghost
[26:27] according to blasphemous names and i
[26:29] truly believe it myself that for adam to
[26:32] have control over all these things he
[26:34] had to be an amateur god
[26:36] so he had to have godlike qualities to
[26:39] be able to handle the situations he
[26:41] handled could you imagine
[26:43] running the whole earth
[26:46] we got presidents that can't and i'm not
[26:48] talking about just obama
[26:51] we got presidents that can't run
[26:52] countries
[26:54] we've got mayors that can't run cities
[26:57] there was a man on earth called adam he
[26:58] run the whole world right
[27:01] so he had to have a godlike quality to
[27:03] be able to do that
[27:05] all right
[27:06] he had to be a mini creator
[27:09] because he had part of the creator in
[27:11] him
[27:11] all right
[27:12] but he couldn't get to the tree of life
[27:15] to get eternal life the way god wanted
[27:18] him to have eternal life all right which
[27:20] was in his flesh but when he left that
[27:22] tree of life and went on the tree of
[27:24] knowledge the first bite he took
[27:27] now remember the word eat means to
[27:29] partake so the first time he partook
[27:32] of this tree of knowledge of good and
[27:33] evil he separated his fellowship with
[27:36] god
[27:37] right
[27:38] and every time that he bites off that
[27:40] tree of knowledge he destroys himself
[27:42] and we go on to see that he made
[27:44] illustrations about cars
[27:47] they want to do away with all these guns
[27:48] and they want to do all with all this
[27:50] stuff cars kill more people than every
[27:53] war that's ever been fought cars kill
[27:55] more people
[27:56] right but now we're not going to turn
[27:58] our cars in and go back to riding horses
[28:00] you will get killed
[28:03] some idiot will hit you
[28:06] with his car
[28:09] all right so let's not say that
[28:13] you know everything's
[28:15] we look at life and we see that
[28:16] electricity is wonderful
[28:19] amen
[28:21] i love thermostats
[28:23] that work
[28:25] but you know that comes right off of the
[28:26] tree of knowledge
[28:28] in glory you're not going to find
[28:30] there's not going to be
[28:32] sorry aaron's not here but we're not
[28:34] going to need an ac man in in glory why
[28:37] because we're going back to the tree of
[28:39] life
[28:40] to where we don't need that anymore
[28:43] adam didn't need it all adam had to do
[28:45] was say
[28:46] peace be still
[28:47] i need some coolness here i need some
[28:50] warmth here adam could control he was
[28:52] his own thermostat so he could control
[28:54] and that's what we're going back to
[28:56] we're going back to you and i
[28:59] being the rulers and the reigners of
[29:01] this earth so so revelations 5 tells us
[29:04] all right that we're going to rule and
[29:05] reign here on the earth and god made the
[29:07] earth in isaiah 44 he says i've made the
[29:10] earth to be inhabited and if we agree
[29:11] that god when he says something he can't
[29:13] take it back
[29:14] if he said he's going to be inhabited
[29:16] it's going to be inhabited but it can't
[29:18] be inhabited by the tree of knowledge
[29:21] because the tree of knowledge is death
[29:23] we're all getting older we're all dying
[29:25] why
[29:26] because we ate off the wrong tree right
[29:30] you say well what about this trees and
[29:32] this fruit and all this stuff
[29:34] all right
[29:36] let's go
[29:37] and just break it down just a moment
[29:42] let's go to the next one
[29:44] i kind of inserted this it's kind of
[29:46] like daddy this is a
[29:48] quote 2a
[29:51] but i wanted to do this because i want
[29:53] us to see we get hung up on words of
[29:56] of don't protect from the fruit of the
[29:58] god of the of the uh
[30:00] tree of knowledge of good and evil you
[30:01] can't partake of the fruit he says we
[30:03] can eat of all the fruit except that one
[30:06] well now
[30:07] watch this in psalms 127 verse 3 the
[30:10] bible says lo children are the heritage
[30:12] of the lord and the fruit of the womb is
[30:14] his reward
[30:16] you're the fruit of your mother
[30:19] you're the fruit of the womb
[30:21] you're what comes forth from the act
[30:24] between the mother and the father you're
[30:25] the fruit
[30:26] or the product all right
[30:29] so what he's telling us he's told evie
[30:31] and adam he says don't eat of that fruit
[30:35] that's not that's not the way i want it
[30:36] to come
[30:39] remember the spoken words original seed
[30:40] not through man's loins all right not
[30:42] through the loins of man and ver in luke
[30:45] 142 talking about mary and elizabeth she
[30:48] spoke out with a loud voice and said
[30:49] blessed art thou among women and blessed
[30:51] is the fruit of thy womb so let's go
[30:54] back to the garden in just a second but
[30:56] look right here what this says
[30:58] that word fruit means
[31:00] offspring
[31:02] children progeny
[31:08] produce right man
[31:10] or produce whichever one you want to say
[31:12] because that's what fruit is fruit is
[31:14] produce it's what's produced from the
[31:16] ground that's why it's called produce
[31:19] so whatever this happened in the garden
[31:21] of eden there was a product made from
[31:23] this
[31:25] don't eat of that fruit
[31:28] all right
[31:30] so literally we know it wasn't an apple
[31:32] that he made
[31:34] wasn't a pomegranate it wasn't something
[31:36] she reached up and got off of a tree
[31:41] amen
[31:43] what did i tell y'all before
[31:45] say amen
[31:47] thank you
[31:50] i'm not the only one that believes this
[31:55] but remember the things that we talk
[31:57] about we talk about the fruit of the
[31:59] womb
[32:00] we talk about
[32:03] our family
[32:04] tree
[32:06] why do we call it a family tree
[32:08] because it's our progeny
[32:10] it's where we come from
[32:12] it's what we do
[32:14] as a family
[32:17] because we all come from the same trunk
[32:20] and i know that many people
[32:24] their tree doesn't have a lot of limbs
[32:25] on it
[32:27] some look like telephone poles
[32:30] but it still comes from a tree right
[32:32] you have a family tree so god is talking
[32:35] he's bringing trees and fruit and he's
[32:38] confounding the wives and prudent and
[32:41] revealing it to a bunch of people who
[32:43] just said well god
[32:45] you know you didn't put
[32:46] fig leaves on eve's mouth and adam's
[32:49] mouth and adam's hand right that's right
[32:52] he gave him
[32:56] lambskins to cover their body
[33:00] all right
[33:01] so
[33:02] we believe
[33:04] and we see through the scripture all the
[33:05] way through
[33:07] because i'm going to have to bring this
[33:08] out
[33:09] to get through the rest of the message
[33:11] that god
[33:13] saw that when he would put man in flesh
[33:15] that he would fall
[33:17] because man is just a higher form of
[33:19] animal
[33:20] this is animal flesh
[33:23] but he put a soul in a man to choose
[33:25] right or wrong that's what he said to
[33:26] adam and eve
[33:28] you'll do okay if you don't eat of that
[33:30] you can eat of everything else but don't
[33:32] eat that well now he didn't tell the
[33:34] animals that
[33:38] it's not it's not
[33:40] uh it's not vulgar for a female dog to
[33:43] to
[33:44] you know procreate in front of a million
[33:46] people
[33:48] we don't think a thing about that we
[33:50] think it's awesome i kind of helped zach
[33:52] a little bit today deliver that
[33:54] calf he was hollering for help down in
[33:56] the barn and i happened to walk up and
[33:59] and thank god i had my boots on
[34:01] all right i had poo all the way up to my
[34:03] knees
[34:04] so i got running down there and
[34:06] there's a calf
[34:08] hanging out of a cow
[34:10] that's the way it happens right
[34:12] but you know what that's the way it
[34:13] happened in the garden right
[34:15] animals were procreating before man
[34:19] right right right
[34:21] so we were to come to that in a sense to
[34:25] where we were supposed to come from the
[34:27] spoken word of god
[34:29] not a sex act
[34:30] amen that's right
[34:32] all right that's the tree of knowledge
[34:34] of good and evil not that the sex act is
[34:36] wrong
[34:37] we're all here
[34:38] we got children so we don't believe that
[34:41] it's wrong
[34:42] all right but we believe if it's not
[34:44] done right it's wrong
[34:46] all right so what happened was is eve
[34:48] let somebody get to her before adam did
[34:52] and that polluted that tree
[34:55] that's right our progeny or what was to
[34:58] come forth from eve
[35:00] the fruit of her womb
[35:02] amen
[35:04] was to be pure
[35:06] right
[35:07] holy amen she was supposed to know
[35:09] nothing but that right
[35:12] but when she started listening to
[35:13] satan's lie through the beast
[35:16] which the bible says the beast is the
[35:18] most was the most subtle creature he was
[35:21] an upright creature he wasn't a snake he
[35:23] was made into a snake
[35:25] we understand that okay
[35:27] he was made into a snake so he must have
[35:29] been something different before he was
[35:30] made into a snake all right that's what
[35:33] i've always said and and we believe here
[35:35] that darwin could have just looked in
[35:37] the bible and if he had a revelation
[35:39] he'd saw the missing link
[35:41] there was the missing link between man
[35:43] and monkey there's a gap there
[35:47] a chimpanzee won't coincide with a woman
[35:50] but remember though in evolution
[35:52] evolution says one evolves into the
[35:55] other
[35:56] and man's the highest form so
[35:58] something's got to evolve all the way up
[36:00] to man
[36:01] the chain was broke somewhere right so
[36:04] satan knew that
[36:06] he knew that that beast standing in the
[36:08] garden the serpent the upright creature
[36:12] because how could a s how could a
[36:14] serpent a snake be guy leave now that's
[36:17] what she said she said he the beast has
[36:19] beguiled me
[36:22] now you can say whatever you want to say
[36:23] but defile if somebody come up to you
[36:25] and said i've been defiled or beguiled
[36:28] you wouldn't think of an apple
[36:34] or an orange
[36:36] or any other fruit but one thing
[36:39] there was a problem somewhere between a
[36:42] man and a woman so we believe that you
[36:44] know trying to add a little something
[36:45] comical but it's really not it's it's a
[36:47] great revelation that we see that it
[36:50] ties all of genesis right into
[36:51] revelations all right we see that it was
[36:53] the beast that started in the garden
[36:55] it's the beast that ends in the book of
[36:57] revelations it's that same old devil
[37:00] that got into that beast
[37:02] and told eve a better way of doing
[37:04] something he's trying to get into this
[37:06] even it has
[37:09] not this eve but that eve out there he's
[37:12] got into her and give her another lie
[37:14] and what is she producing
[37:16] bastard children right
[37:19] exactly sorry that's just the way it is
[37:21] all right but now look so we look at
[37:24] these words of eating and partaking in
[37:26] fruit and trees so let's not be carnal
[37:29] and see that it was a a tree in the
[37:32] garden of eden
[37:34] it was a it was a person
[37:37] right
[37:39] it was a person
[37:43] now
[37:46] and then what happened in the garden
[37:49] there was fruit produced there was two
[37:51] fruit
[37:52] right that's right one was cane
[37:55] one was able
[37:56] twins
[37:58] all right
[37:59] one by the beast came
[38:01] because he produced exactly remember if
[38:04] you are an apple tree
[38:05] pears are not going to fall off of your
[38:07] limb right right
[38:09] if you're an apple tree
[38:11] that fruit is going to fall off and it's
[38:12] called an apple because you have apple
[38:14] life in you well kane showed he had a
[38:17] problem that adam was not his daddy
[38:20] the beast was his daddy
[38:23] and you know as i was telling june the
[38:25] other day we were talking about
[38:26] something and
[38:27] excuse me you know brother branham said
[38:29] that that where did somebody ask himself
[38:31] where did cain get his wife
[38:33] and he said we married his sister well
[38:35] actually it wasn't his sister
[38:39] it was his half sister
[38:43] because adam was the daddy of all the
[38:44] girls
[38:46] the beast was the daddy of cain
[38:48] do you know that beastly that beast's
[38:49] dna is still around somewhere
[38:52] remember they asked brother branham that
[38:54] he said it's in that serpent
[38:55] remember that's what he said he said
[38:57] lord explain to me because you know that
[38:59] seed that came out of the beast that
[39:01] went into eve to produce cane
[39:03] cain didn't die came produced children
[39:05] so there's a progeny of of that fruit
[39:08] that come off the wrong tree but now
[39:10] remember once that happened
[39:13] then we all come from that tree
[39:15] because abel needed a sacrifice just
[39:18] like cain did amen right that's where
[39:20] people in the message they said oh abel
[39:21] was so and abel was righteous
[39:24] he knew what to offer
[39:27] right because he come from a godly
[39:29] lineage his dad adam took care of him
[39:31] right
[39:33] procaine didn't have a daddy
[39:35] his daddy was
[39:36] crawling around in holes yeah
[39:38] let's be honest really that's where the
[39:40] beast went
[39:42] but you see that cain comes from this
[39:46] progeny or from this tree
[39:49] but once that happened to eve it moved
[39:52] us all over onto the tree of knowledge
[39:54] of good and evil because even adam
[39:58] moved from the tree of life
[40:01] to the tree of knowledge of good and
[40:03] evil and sold all of us out
[40:05] because we're going to see that's what
[40:06] was that's what was kind of um
[40:09] burning in my heart and we'll finish
[40:11] this but i want to kind of give you
[40:12] maybe the end of the story
[40:16] that tree of life standing in the garden
[40:18] was genesis 1 26-27
[40:26] because i'm going to read you a quote in
[40:28] just a minute where brother brown said
[40:29] it was the holy ghost right exactly
[40:31] and it they ain't too holy ghost
[40:34] if you've got the holy ghost and this
[40:35] genesis 1 26 and the holy ghost was
[40:37] standing in the garden because see
[40:39] that's what we were supposed to get to
[40:41] right we were supposed to get to that we
[40:43] were supposed to come
[40:44] and be given eternal life
[40:47] but since we eat off the tree of
[40:49] knowledge we're polluted that's why
[40:51] we're dying that's why death is in the
[40:53] camp exactly
[40:54] but with the new birth
[40:57] i was preaching on a new birth this
[40:59] weekend and
[41:00] and uh deanna went with us and
[41:02] and
[41:03] she punched june i was talking about you
[41:05] know i was born from samuel and peggy
[41:07] dale and then i got a new birth because
[41:09] my first birth from samuel and peggy
[41:11] dale i'm dying
[41:14] but my second birth from heaven
[41:16] the new birth which is that genesis 1 26
[41:19] calling my name and i responded she
[41:21] punched june and said
[41:23] paw paw was born two times
[41:28] that's right she listened
[41:31] and that's absolutely correct right
[41:33] because my first birth was off the tree
[41:35] of knowledge of good and evil
[41:37] my name's got to get transferred
[41:39] somewhere
[41:40] to that tree of life all right
[41:42] and i want to i'll read you a quote on
[41:44] that that i really found that was that
[41:46] was striking that brother branham you
[41:48] say well now i don't know about this
[41:52] brother brown said in a paradox don't
[41:53] put it up but i'm going to read it to
[41:54] man it says you and i are hanging on the
[41:57] tree of life after we've accepted christ
[42:00] right
[42:02] what i want you to see tonight is that
[42:04] tree of life there's not something out
[42:05] yonder it's not something we got to get
[42:07] to it's not something right
[42:09] that's right we're hanging on it glory
[42:12] because we're the fruit of that
[42:13] production of that tree
[42:16] which is jesus christ not by sex anymore
[42:19] by the spoken word which is the way it
[42:21] should have been all right so now dad
[42:23] read this the other night
[42:25] an exposition of the seven church ages
[42:27] but we're going to read it again because
[42:29] we're going to kind of go through it a
[42:30] little slow
[42:32] now that we have come this far let me
[42:33] try to crystallize your thinking on this
[42:35] subject so you can see the necessity of
[42:37] our going into the serpent seed doctrine
[42:38] as i have
[42:40] we start with the fact that there were
[42:42] two trees in the midst of the garden
[42:44] the tree of life was jesus the other
[42:46] tree is definitely satan because of what
[42:49] came forth of the fruit of that tree
[42:52] amen
[42:53] got it
[42:54] all right the fruit of that tree in
[42:56] other words the production of that tree
[42:58] was death
[43:00] all right
[43:02] obviously the production of the tree of
[43:03] life would mean life all right
[43:07] now then we know that both of those
[43:08] trees
[43:10] had a relationship to man
[43:13] or they would never have been placed
[43:14] there right
[43:16] so now how do we have a relationship
[43:19] with a physical tree oak
[43:21] palm
[43:22] pine
[43:24] we have no physical relationship with a
[43:26] tree
[43:28] but yet the two trees we had a physical
[43:30] relationship because
[43:32] it was part of what we were
[43:34] satan on this side
[43:36] god on this side you're sitting there
[43:38] today with satan on this side god on
[43:40] this side all right you still have a
[43:43] choice
[43:46] they must have had a part in the
[43:48] sovereign plan and purpose of god in
[43:50] their relationship to mankind
[43:53] and to himself or we could never impute
[43:56] omniscience unto god
[43:58] all right in other words he's
[44:00] all-knowing he knew all this was going
[44:01] to happen there was no crisis meeting in
[44:03] heaven when satan did what he did with
[44:05] eve
[44:06] god knew that he knew when he put us in
[44:08] flesh we would fall because the flesh is
[44:10] weak all right
[44:12] it's just animal flesh until you get the
[44:14] holy ghost right
[44:16] that's why we were trying to get to the
[44:18] tree of life amen and the way stopped to
[44:22] get there
[44:23] not now but it was then right all right
[44:27] they must have had a part in the
[44:28] sovereign plan and purpose of god and
[44:30] their relationship to mankind and to
[44:31] himself or we can never impute
[44:33] omniscience unto god this is all true so
[44:35] far is it not
[44:37] now the word most definitely sets forth
[44:39] that from before the foundation of the
[44:41] earth the purpose of god was to share
[44:44] his eternal life with man
[44:48] to me that's just
[44:51] i mean before the foundation of the
[44:52] world our names were put on the lamb's
[44:53] book of life he was a lamb slain before
[44:55] the foundation of the world adam was
[44:57] covered before he got here
[44:59] eve was covered before he got here
[45:02] all right i'm talking about before jesus
[45:04] got here
[45:05] all right
[45:06] and we'll read something in just a
[45:07] minute
[45:08] it may shake your bones
[45:11] man could not directly come and partake
[45:13] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[45:15] garden that eternal life of the tree had
[45:18] to become flesh
[45:20] first right
[45:22] amen
[45:24] all right
[45:25] because the genesis 1 26 man all of that
[45:27] manifestation of that genesis 1 26 man
[45:30] was not all in adam
[45:36] adam was going to be able to produce
[45:37] that
[45:40] he had the control to do it
[45:44] right but we weren't all that genesis 1
[45:47] 26 man is not a flesh man
[45:49] that's a spirit man
[45:51] and when gen and when god created or
[45:53] brought adam out of the dust of the
[45:55] ground he put part of that 126 man into
[45:57] adam
[45:58] all right everybody okay with that
[46:01] all right
[46:02] that's why he could be what he was all
[46:04] right he was the son of god the bible
[46:05] calls him a son of god so i agree with
[46:07] the bible all right
[46:09] man could not directly come and partake
[46:11] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[46:12] garden that eternal life of the tree had
[46:15] to become flesh first so the tree of
[46:17] life was eternal amen
[46:21] all right so there's a characteristic
[46:23] the tree of life was eternal whatever
[46:25] come off of that tree of life whatever
[46:27] that tree of life was it's eternal life
[46:29] and it's like i told them this past
[46:30] weekend there's only one form of eternal
[46:33] life
[46:34] there's not two eternal life there's not
[46:36] three eternal life there's not a
[46:37] different eternal life over here that
[46:39] god's got and a different eternal life
[46:41] that you and i have hello
[46:43] not different same all right
[46:46] now he had it in the fullness
[46:48] because remember he was born right the
[46:50] first time jesus christ was born right
[46:52] he was born without sin you and i were
[46:54] born in sin shaping iniquity
[46:56] spouse from our mother's womb
[46:58] the fruit of the tree of knowledge
[47:01] all right
[47:03] whether you like it or not
[47:04] but there's a way back
[47:07] he didn't leave us without the way back
[47:10] and i'll read you something just a
[47:11] minute that really struck my soul last
[47:13] night i wasn't really looking for it but
[47:16] if you'll just pop up tree of life as
[47:17] about 198 quotes and read through there
[47:20] and they'll really
[47:21] bless your heart because a lot of times
[47:22] we just say well the tree of life is
[47:24] jesus and and he's this and he's that
[47:27] i want to make it more personal
[47:30] now you and i weren't standing in the
[47:32] garden of eden watching all this going
[47:33] on but you know what the reason that we
[47:36] can see what's going on in the garden
[47:38] it's because what's inside of you was
[47:40] standing there in the garden
[47:43] that's what we've got to see and if
[47:45] we're going to ever take a body change
[47:47] we got to see that that genesis 1 26 man
[47:50] never sinned right
[47:52] that's right never had a bad thought
[47:56] you and i've had one today i'm sure
[48:01] this is yes this is no
[48:04] if you're perfect that's fine pray for
[48:05] us we're not as far up the tree as you
[48:07] are
[48:08] all right but we did we had bad thoughts
[48:11] we had bad ideas but that was in the
[48:13] human realm that was in the realm of
[48:15] human flesh that that we come into
[48:17] satan's domain and he is bombarding our
[48:20] brain there's no way that you can uh
[48:22] repent enough to get good enough right
[48:25] that's right
[48:27] brother brown said the other day i was
[48:28] talking to brother claude he said and he
[48:30] read me the quote he said brother brown
[48:32] said own our best day we're a failure
[48:36] now if you'll approach it that way on
[48:38] our best day
[48:40] brother chris never misses a note he
[48:42] plays right through 25 songs and never
[48:45] misses a note and he misses one note on
[48:48] number 26. he's a failure yeah
[48:53] i don't think so
[48:54] but anyway i mean that's the way you got
[48:55] to look at it
[48:56] the best we can do now that's a profit
[48:59] telling us the best we can do were
[49:00] failures right so if we'll approach it
[49:02] that way and see that it has to be
[49:05] in christ
[49:07] we have to be in christ
[49:09] it's not that we're this great tree of
[49:11] life and and we're this great thing with
[49:13] the you know with a uh tnl on our on our
[49:16] chest tree of life
[49:17] you know we're not a superman in other
[49:19] words but what it's what god has made us
[49:21] though if we go and partake of that tree
[49:24] of life then we get life
[49:26] but it's a choice that we have to make
[49:29] all right it's a choice it's it all
[49:32] still comes down to choice all right
[49:34] even when you're born again you've still
[49:35] got choices to make right because we're
[49:38] still human this thing right here is
[49:39] subject to sin it's subject to bad
[49:42] thoughts in our brain
[49:43] don't try to
[49:45] don't try to do away with the thoughts i
[49:47] i see a lot of people and and i want to
[49:49] make this known i see a lot of people
[49:51] that that they just listen to brother
[49:53] branham and hey listen
[49:56] don't get me wrong
[49:57] but what they're doing i'm seeing is is
[50:00] they're trying to ward off demons
[50:03] by listening to the prophet 24 7.
[50:06] you drive yourself crazy
[50:08] live a human life
[50:11] we're human beings i was thinking coming
[50:13] up the road today i was thinking
[50:15] god brother branham wanted to be
[50:18] a prophet to storm out
[50:20] save thus saith the lord and walk back
[50:23] into the wilderness
[50:25] now
[50:26] that didn't happen
[50:28] but remember there was no prophet that
[50:30] ever came on the face of this earth that
[50:32] was as complete as that man was
[50:34] he was a father
[50:37] he had children he enjoyed his wife he
[50:40] enjoyed her company
[50:42] he enjoyed millions of people at one
[50:45] time in his ministry
[50:47] he was given a million and a half
[50:48] dollars and he turned it down
[50:51] handed the check back to the people
[50:55] because there were stipulations involved
[50:57] and he knew that
[50:59] but we see that that he's come
[51:01] to where he was a a prophet of prophets
[51:04] he wasn't like elijah elijah's never had
[51:06] a
[51:07] i never saw in the bible where he had a
[51:09] wife
[51:10] you know elisha some of them gave their
[51:12] life for the gospel of jesus christ or
[51:14] the gospel that that they knew
[51:17] and then here you got brother branham
[51:18] who who was a father he he was a son to
[51:21] a daddy and he loved his mother and he
[51:23] got to she got to sit under his ministry
[51:25] for years and and he baptized all of his
[51:27] family i mean look how complete he was
[51:29] so
[51:30] i'm glad he wasn't a prophet that
[51:32] stormed out and said thus saith the lord
[51:34] and went back in the wilderness i'm glad
[51:36] he was a man that walked among us that
[51:38] that could put up a christmas tree
[51:44] that won't go too well but that's all
[51:46] right
[51:47] praise the lord anyhow
[51:49] man could not directly let's go back man
[51:52] could not directly come and partake of
[51:54] that tree of life in the midst of the
[51:55] garden that eternal life of the tree had
[51:58] to become flesh first now the reason it
[52:00] didn't become flesh back then
[52:03] it's what
[52:05] what eve and the beast did
[52:08] god said i'll not come through an
[52:10] unclean vessel when eve was polluted
[52:12] when she had the relationship with the
[52:14] beast
[52:15] thinking she was doing right because it
[52:18] did say multiplying replenish the earth
[52:20] she was trying to do what god said she
[52:21] wasn't a perverted woman right right
[52:24] she underperverted woman right all right
[52:26] she was trying to forward god's plan but
[52:29] that's why your sisters can't preach
[52:31] you've got an emotional side it's like
[52:33] somebody said the other day
[52:35] you know what satan got to first
[52:39] eve's motherly instinct
[52:42] because she was a woman
[52:44] he got to her motherly instinct and
[52:47] that's exactly what he did
[52:49] that beef said hey look at those
[52:51] puppies having puppies look at how that
[52:53] mother mothers that puppy look at the
[52:56] mother part and she just stepped right
[52:58] into it not knowing what she was doing
[53:01] right remember she was deceived
[53:04] but adam wasn't adam knew what went on
[53:06] but adam in portraying christ he took
[53:09] eve because he was literally a part of
[53:11] him
[53:12] literally
[53:13] it literally that was adam in another
[53:15] form
[53:16] all right
[53:17] but she was to reproduce off the tree of
[53:20] life right
[53:22] because they said multiply and replace
[53:23] the earth did it not right in genesis 1
[53:25] 26 that's what she was supposed to do
[53:28] but satan got there first
[53:30] injected his plan first in this womb
[53:35] this is the greatest womb right here is
[53:37] the womb of your mind
[53:39] then she just acted the part
[53:42] of the mother
[53:44] and
[53:45] cain came forth well god said hey
[53:47] i can't do anything with that anymore
[53:50] you can't get to the tree of life
[53:53] adam you can't even get back to it
[53:55] because they're so holy you can't have
[53:57] you can't get a body change from this
[53:59] you can't get you're going to die
[54:01] because he said the day you eat thereof
[54:03] that's the day you're going to die all
[54:05] right
[54:06] okay so everybody got that
[54:08] but before god could raise and save a
[54:10] sinner he had to have a sinner to raise
[54:12] and save man had to fall
[54:15] all right the fall
[54:18] which would be caused by satan had to
[54:20] have flesh to make fall now remember
[54:23] daddy preached this other day wonderful
[54:25] wonderful message satan had to come
[54:27] through flesh also right
[54:29] but it wasn't through human flesh
[54:33] he had to use animal flesh
[54:36] all right satan had to come to flesh
[54:38] also but satan could not come through
[54:39] human flesh
[54:41] satan vicariously entered that beast and
[54:45] produced his product to eve and she
[54:46] protook it to make the fall as would
[54:48] christ come in human flesh to restore
[54:50] the fall amen all right
[54:53] everybody got that say ma'am
[54:57] all right
[54:59] let's go to number four
[55:02] and i want to kind of set a stage here
[55:03] this is a i love this quote
[55:07] because remember
[55:10] even cain as bad as he was and as bad as
[55:13] the product that was produced
[55:15] god still
[55:17] cain was a soul
[55:20] cain had soul right right right
[55:23] cain wasn't cursed and was black and all
[55:25] these other things like people said
[55:26] that's not true
[55:28] cain was cursed because of what he did
[55:31] right
[55:32] he's talked to god like he
[55:35] like he was a dog almost all right he
[55:37] didn't have the right attitude he didn't
[55:39] he didn't approach god but listen this
[55:41] puts everybody on equal basis right here
[55:43] 1957 thirsting for life and i thought
[55:46] what makes people do that how come that
[55:48] men and women will do these things and i
[55:49] thought this god created man to thirst
[55:52] for life
[55:54] all right that thirst that's in you is a
[55:56] creation of god amen
[55:59] now that's
[56:00] everybody exactly
[56:03] adolf hitler
[56:06] had a thirst for god
[56:08] he wanted a superhuman race right
[56:12] well what's god gonna have right a
[56:14] superhuman race
[56:18] what adolf hitler's problem was is he
[56:20] ate off the tree of knowledge right
[56:22] right
[56:23] and stayed on the tree of knowledge
[56:25] he didn't ever get the new birth if he
[56:26] got a new birth he wouldn't have done
[56:27] what he done
[56:28] all right so he stayed on that tree and
[56:30] right and wrong is set before you as a
[56:32] tree of life
[56:34] and death
[56:35] in the garden of eden and god made you
[56:37] to thirst and how dare you take that
[56:39] blessed thirst that god has put in you
[56:41] to thirst after him and try to quench it
[56:43] on the things of the world
[56:46] because see everybody says well you come
[56:47] with this seed in you and that's why you
[56:49] could respond to eternal life or you
[56:51] could respond to the word well brother
[56:53] brown puts everybody on equal basis
[56:54] right here right the devil trying to
[56:56] make men and women run the nightclubs
[56:58] and cocktail parties and live immorally
[57:00] because they are thirsting and that
[57:02] thirst that's in you
[57:04] is of god
[57:07] hey even man in his fallen condition has
[57:09] a god-like quality
[57:10] adolf hitler had a god-like quality what
[57:12] he had an anointing
[57:14] he could get people to literally die for
[57:16] him
[57:17] right
[57:17] all right so he had an anointing but he
[57:19] turned that anointing that god was going
[57:21] to give him elvis presley had an
[57:23] anointing
[57:24] he sold that anointing out for a fleet
[57:26] of cadillacs or for money or for fame or
[57:28] for fortune right
[57:30] so there was a thirst
[57:32] and that thirst that's in you is of god
[57:35] all right
[57:36] and it'll never be satisfied until
[57:38] christ that fountain of everlasting life
[57:40] fills your soul it is totally impossible
[57:44] because until you eat off the tree of
[57:47] life you're going to eat off the tree of
[57:49] knowledge of good and evil there's only
[57:50] two trees
[57:51] there's not a tree and a half somewhere
[57:54] there's not a tree and a quarter there's
[57:56] two trees all right
[57:59] because they are thirsting christ the
[58:00] fountain of everlasting life filled your
[58:02] soul is totally impossible the devil
[58:03] will make you believe that you're living
[58:05] but you are dead in sin and trespasses
[58:08] how could you take that blessed
[58:10] holy thirst all right so everybody's own
[58:12] free moral agency everybody's come here
[58:15] the same hey listen cain and abel were
[58:17] born the same way right amen that's
[58:20] right
[58:21] they were born from their mother
[58:24] by their father's natural seed
[58:26] it was just
[58:28] satan's or the beast on one side and
[58:30] adam on the other all right you say how
[58:32] can that happen well many times it's
[58:34] happened
[58:35] many times even recently i know when
[58:36] brother branham preached it remember
[58:38] there was a white woman had a black baby
[58:39] and a white baby she had been with a
[58:41] black man that morning and a white man
[58:43] the afternoon and she had a set of twins
[58:44] and one with black one was white that
[58:46] happened not too long ago
[58:48] i think it was in chicago that there was
[58:50] a a woman had two babies
[58:53] by two different men so it's not
[58:56] it's not so far-fetched
[58:58] to say that that happened which we read
[59:00] in the bible we see that absolutely
[59:01] that's what happened all right so let's
[59:03] go to the next one this is where i want
[59:05] us to to hone in on here
[59:07] and and finish up
[59:09] and look at these characteristics this
[59:11] is from a paradox
[59:12] i was thinking of death and we're on
[59:14] we're on leaves a leaf hangs on a tree
[59:17] to serve a purpose now he's talking
[59:18] about natural type and the spiritual we
[59:20] look at the trees outside right now what
[59:22] are they they're dead
[59:24] but they're not
[59:26] there's life in it somewhere
[59:28] it just an intelligence told it to go
[59:30] into the roots
[59:32] until this until the sun comes out and
[59:35] then when the sun comes out it comes
[59:37] back up out of the now man didn't tell
[59:39] it to do that right right
[59:41] it's by nature it's by god he said it
[59:43] that way same thing with you and i all
[59:45] right this is what the prophet is is
[59:46] showing a leaf hangs on a tree to serve
[59:48] a purpose and you and i are hanging on a
[59:50] tree of life after we've accepted christ
[59:54] we didn't come here in this world
[59:55] hanging on the tree of life
[59:59] we came here hanging on the tree of
[1:00:00] knowledge of good and evil whether you
[1:00:02] like it or not right
[1:00:04] you were the product
[1:00:06] of that product right right that's why
[1:00:09] brother brown said you could you were
[1:00:10] born between satan and eve
[1:00:12] swank could say that because that's the
[1:00:14] that's what he came from right all right
[1:00:17] every death every sorrow every heartache
[1:00:19] every war every funeral home every
[1:00:22] funeral service everything started in
[1:00:24] the garden of eden right right because
[1:00:25] there was no death before that
[1:00:27] they could go to the tree of life and
[1:00:29] have life all right but they chose to go
[1:00:32] to the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:00:33] evil you and i are hanging on a tree of
[1:00:34] life after we've accepted christ
[1:00:37] and after a while when the season's
[1:00:39] changed life goes out of that leaf down
[1:00:41] into the root comes back again next year
[1:00:43] bringing a new leaf now remember
[1:00:46] we christians who believe in christ have
[1:00:48] eternal life and hanging on the tree of
[1:00:51] life glory but someday this old leaf
[1:00:53] will drop off now he's talking about
[1:00:54] this guy it'll go down into the ground
[1:00:57] die but there come a resurrection just
[1:00:59] as sure as the
[1:01:00] leaves come back on that tree next year
[1:01:03] in about march or april that same life
[1:01:06] that's in that tree if it's got an apple
[1:01:08] life in it there's an apple tree gonna
[1:01:10] that apple sap is gonna come right back
[1:01:12] up it's gonna go right out to the end of
[1:01:13] the into the branches and guess what
[1:01:16] there's an apple going to be produced
[1:01:17] all right same thing with you and i
[1:01:19] that's why it says those who are dead in
[1:01:21] christ
[1:01:23] shall rise first it didn't say dead
[1:01:27] because all the dead's not coming up
[1:01:30] i've always said that don't mean
[1:01:31] physical death
[1:01:33] if you're dead in christ you'll rise
[1:01:35] first
[1:01:36] because you never died that's right but
[1:01:39] if you died in christ you got to do that
[1:01:41] here right you got to die to yourself
[1:01:43] and get on that tree of life
[1:01:46] all right
[1:01:47] because we are on a different tree i'm
[1:01:48] sorry
[1:01:51] countdown
[1:01:52] 1962.
[1:01:55] tree hangs this leaf and they explaining
[1:01:57] the same thing
[1:01:58] and we are on a tree of life when we're
[1:02:00] born again
[1:02:03] not
[1:02:03] when we're born the first time
[1:02:06] right right
[1:02:09] one more time do y'all not believe that
[1:02:12] oh amen that means so be it
[1:02:15] and we are on a tree of life when we're
[1:02:17] born again amen and when life leaves
[1:02:19] this
[1:02:20] the life goes back to the god that gave
[1:02:22] it to come again in the millennium with
[1:02:24] a leaf that can't drop off the tree
[1:02:27] there you are eternal that's perpetual
[1:02:30] life we have eternal life
[1:02:32] now remember that tree that was in the
[1:02:35] garden of eden was eternal right
[1:02:38] tree of life was eternal
[1:02:40] now we're going to read in a little
[1:02:41] while that tree in the in the book of
[1:02:43] revelations
[1:02:45] is inside the city
[1:02:47] and it's eternal amen amen all right
[1:02:52] let's go to number seven
[1:02:54] and i'm so glad
[1:02:55] that the tree of life is still blooming
[1:02:59] the holy spirit
[1:03:02] here
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] so the tree of life's the holy ghost
[1:03:08] or the holy spirit if ghost bothers you
[1:03:11] it's the holy spirit
[1:03:12] right that's right hey it does bother
[1:03:14] some don't say holy ghost to a baptist
[1:03:16] they'll get all shivering
[1:03:18] say holy spirit
[1:03:20] but it's the same thing
[1:03:22] the holy spirit here where one time it
[1:03:24] drove us away from the tree because
[1:03:26] remember
[1:03:28] once that was cut off between adam and
[1:03:30] eve and what they did in the garden
[1:03:32] there's no way the holy ghost could be
[1:03:34] given to anybody until the way was made
[1:03:36] back
[1:03:38] how simple can it be just looking at the
[1:03:40] tree of life
[1:03:42] if you can't get back to it then that
[1:03:44] must mean that nobody in the old
[1:03:46] testament had the holy ghost
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] but when jesus came and give us the way
[1:03:52] back
[1:03:55] he said i am the way
[1:03:56] the truth and the life amen
[1:03:59] on the day of pentecost that tree came
[1:04:01] back
[1:04:02] the way was jesus
[1:04:06] remember he didn't come dated ready like
[1:04:08] sunday he didn't come to bring us an
[1:04:09] inheritance our inheritance was hanging
[1:04:12] on the tree of life
[1:04:16] our inheritance was the holy ghost glory
[1:04:19] our inheritance was our name in the book
[1:04:20] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:23] that's right amen amen
[1:04:25] there's the tree of life standing in the
[1:04:26] garden
[1:04:28] it had the ability to bring me and you
[1:04:30] the same holy ghost you've got in you
[1:04:32] tonight it's the same one that was
[1:04:33] standing back there
[1:04:36] that's why we can understand these
[1:04:38] things i've already said this and you
[1:04:39] won't you'll understand it one day when
[1:04:41] you get a revelation it ain't your
[1:04:43] knowledge
[1:04:46] man's knowledge says
[1:04:47] fully on genesis where it was an app it
[1:04:50] said i had to be an apple hey
[1:04:54] don't think so right that's right
[1:04:57] adam and eve did not go around with
[1:04:59] skins on their hands and their mouth
[1:05:01] right their private parts were covered
[1:05:03] up right now they were naked before what
[1:05:05] made them find out that was dirty right
[1:05:08] and it's not dirty if you do it right
[1:05:12] i'm so glad that the tree of life is
[1:05:14] still blooming the holy spirit here
[1:05:16] right all right that's pretty neat i
[1:05:19] like that quote i'm gonna keep that one
[1:05:21] that's in my favor hall of favorites
[1:05:22] right there
[1:05:25] because see that's what struck me when
[1:05:26] daddy was preaching that he's talking
[1:05:28] about the tree of life something that
[1:05:30] had life had to be in that garden
[1:05:33] because there was death there too
[1:05:36] exactly
[1:05:37] all would have died if there hadn't been
[1:05:38] a tree of life standing there away
[1:05:43] was marred
[1:05:44] in genesis
[1:05:46] but when jesus came he brought that tree
[1:05:49] with him right glory
[1:05:51] that's right
[1:05:53] then he opened himself up at calvary
[1:05:56] and said now
[1:05:58] i'll read you a quote in a minute now
[1:05:59] i'm going to have a bride tree right
[1:06:02] we've missed that one right but the
[1:06:04] bride three in the tree of life is the
[1:06:05] same thing
[1:06:07] if not you've got two different eternal
[1:06:08] lifes again
[1:06:10] all right
[1:06:12] i love this
[1:06:14] where one time it drove us away from the
[1:06:15] tree until there was could be reconciled
[1:06:18] to god through a blood sacrifice
[1:06:22] animal blood had no eternal life in it
[1:06:25] exactly
[1:06:26] that's right
[1:06:28] and no man
[1:06:29] born from the tree of knowledge of good
[1:06:31] and evil could have eternal life in it
[1:06:34] exactly not before jesus amen
[1:06:38] jesus came with eternal life in him amen
[1:06:42] therefore he could give it to us so the
[1:06:44] eternal sacrifice was a blood sacrifice
[1:06:48] absolutely it was a man but absolutely
[1:06:51] it was the blood of god
[1:06:52] mary had nothing to do with it neither
[1:06:54] did joseph had nothing to do with it it
[1:06:57] was god almighty
[1:06:59] created egg and sperm placed it in an
[1:07:01] oven called mary
[1:07:05] so he wasn't a jew he wasn't a gentile
[1:07:07] he was god gloria he lied if he said i
[1:07:11] come from god and i went to god if he
[1:07:12] said i come from mary and went to mary
[1:07:14] he didn't say that he said i come from
[1:07:15] god and i go to god
[1:07:17] so he came straight from the hand of god
[1:07:20] god created an egg
[1:07:23] created a sperm
[1:07:24] put it in mary you say how in the world
[1:07:26] that hey like mama said they're proving
[1:07:28] it every day now
[1:07:30] there was a grandmother the other day
[1:07:31] had her own grandchild right
[1:07:35] they took the egg from the mother
[1:07:38] egg from the father some way she
[1:07:40] couldn't produce they put it in grandma
[1:07:43] and she had the baby
[1:07:45] y'all saw it i saw it on the internet
[1:07:47] she had her own grandchild
[1:07:50] why
[1:07:53] law of god
[1:07:55] he said multiply and replenish the earth
[1:07:57] he even said it when they were in flesh
[1:07:59] so guess what
[1:08:01] he told the animals he told noah after
[1:08:04] the flood he said multiply and replenish
[1:08:06] the earth
[1:08:06] there's a law there when an egg and a
[1:08:08] sperm comes together if you put it in a
[1:08:10] warm environment it's going to have a
[1:08:12] baby
[1:08:13] so let's don't think so much that it
[1:08:15] that we can't see that a creator that
[1:08:17] created all the universe he created
[1:08:19] every star he created what you're
[1:08:20] standing on he actually created you
[1:08:23] could create an egg and a sperm and put
[1:08:24] it in a woman
[1:08:27] that's right that's the only way he can
[1:08:29] be virgin born
[1:08:30] all right so let's get off of this junk
[1:08:32] about mary producing anything mary
[1:08:35] produced nothing
[1:08:38] god almighty created
[1:08:41] that's why in revelations 3 14 it says
[1:08:44] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:46] god
[1:08:48] you know why because that is what we
[1:08:51] were supposed to be in the garden
[1:08:56] that's why i can look back in the garden
[1:08:59] and i can see exactly what happened
[1:09:03] because christ came to come in here that
[1:09:06] i can look back now
[1:09:09] i told him the other day
[1:09:11] that's why brother brown said when the
[1:09:13] bride realizes who she is
[1:09:15] and what she's doing here
[1:09:17] should be an invincible army
[1:09:19] now remember we got to see where we come
[1:09:21] from the seals shows three things right
[1:09:24] that which was which is and which is to
[1:09:27] come right right and then what he said
[1:09:28] many times on the seal but that which
[1:09:30] was which is so we can look back to what
[1:09:32] was
[1:09:33] and realized that that new birth that we
[1:09:36] have in us was that tree of life
[1:09:38] standing in the garden of eden
[1:09:40] not another person
[1:09:43] not god sending a son amen no he created
[1:09:46] himself a body
[1:09:47] and then he stepped into that body as a
[1:09:50] baby
[1:09:51] hello
[1:09:52] as a baby
[1:09:54] because he had to be a blood sacrifice
[1:09:56] he had to be our brother
[1:10:00] he couldn't be an animal
[1:10:03] animal
[1:10:04] sacrifices only push sin to calvary
[1:10:09] because remember that animal blood had
[1:10:11] no soul that had no eternal property
[1:10:14] about it right but when god came in
[1:10:16] human flesh he had an eternal property
[1:10:19] glory yes sir exactly caused us called
[1:10:22] the soul of almighty god amen
[1:10:25] the very one who said let there be
[1:10:27] hey even the bible says you're the
[1:10:29] creator
[1:10:31] jesus christ is the one who created all
[1:10:33] things not jesus the flesh amen
[1:10:36] but he was born we see now that we come
[1:10:38] up to christmas time the bible says he
[1:10:40] was born
[1:10:42] lord
[1:10:43] the christ
[1:10:45] so you take that christ that identity of
[1:10:47] that christ and you take it back when we
[1:10:48] were talking about genesis 1 26 there
[1:10:50] was the christ there was the one that
[1:10:52] said let there be
[1:10:54] and that's the one that come into you
[1:10:55] and i if you're born again tonight that
[1:10:57] same person amen
[1:10:59] that same person no smaller or no
[1:11:02] greater came into me and you and gave us
[1:11:05] eternal life amen
[1:11:07] and you can't deny the word if he did oh
[1:11:09] right
[1:11:11] because it is the word it'd be word
[1:11:12] denying word it'd be god denying god you
[1:11:14] can't do that
[1:11:16] that's why i'm telling you we can
[1:11:17] understand things people can't
[1:11:19] understand because people think they got
[1:11:20] the new birth because they live good
[1:11:23] judas lived good right that's right
[1:11:27] remember he fooled all 11 of them
[1:11:29] disciples the only person he didn't fool
[1:11:31] was jesus
[1:11:33] right
[1:11:35] because they were asking questions well
[1:11:36] who is it lord is it me is it me is it
[1:11:38] me he said the one that stops the bowl
[1:11:40] and there was judas probably stopping
[1:11:42] the bowl
[1:11:43] and they still didn't see it
[1:11:46] why their eyes were blinded because
[1:11:47] judas was so close to jesus satan is so
[1:11:51] close to god
[1:11:54] oh it's not the honky tonks in the bars
[1:11:55] and he doesn't wear a red suit with a
[1:11:57] red tail and horns
[1:12:00] no the bible says he was made beautiful
[1:12:03] he was the anointed cherub
[1:12:05] he'll anoint you and make you think it's
[1:12:07] god
[1:12:09] when it's the absolute devil himself
[1:12:13] but the way you can find out is if you
[1:12:16] deny this word that's who it is if you
[1:12:19] don't deny this word if something rings
[1:12:21] in your heart
[1:12:22] if something rings in your heart that
[1:12:24] that ain't nothing but the truth that's
[1:12:26] what mary said that ain't nothing but
[1:12:28] the truth be it unto me according to
[1:12:29] that word and that's what you and i got
[1:12:30] to get to but we see that somewhere down
[1:12:33] the line though you're going to produce
[1:12:35] what tree you're on right because the
[1:12:37] truth the tree will always produce fruit
[1:12:40] right all right so you're going to
[1:12:41] produce one way or the other you're
[1:12:42] either going to be on the tree of
[1:12:44] knowledge stay on the tree of knowledge
[1:12:46] it's not have a problem we don't have a
[1:12:48] problem being on the tree of knowledge
[1:12:50] the problem is it's staying on the tree
[1:12:51] of knowledge yeah because that's the way
[1:12:52] we came we could not determine the way
[1:12:55] we came here right
[1:12:57] exactly
[1:12:59] right
[1:13:01] what my uh
[1:13:03] we were talking about a certain cousin
[1:13:04] of ours
[1:13:06] and it was a in-law that we were talking
[1:13:08] to and
[1:13:09] he said well you know he said
[1:13:11] your cousin didn't have a
[1:13:14] thing to do with him getting into the
[1:13:15] dale family
[1:13:17] and i looked at him and i said
[1:13:19] but you married into one yeah
[1:13:22] you're the one who's got the problem
[1:13:24] he didn't have a choice you did
[1:13:27] so in other words we were born between
[1:13:29] satan and even there was nothing we
[1:13:30] could do about it right we were born
[1:13:32] into that family because of our
[1:13:33] adulterous parent adam and eve now is
[1:13:35] that what the prophet said
[1:13:37] adulterers of parents put us onto this
[1:13:40] tree but we don't have to stay on that
[1:13:42] tree anymore
[1:13:44] we've got a way made back to the tree of
[1:13:46] life but we got to realize it's not a
[1:13:48] tree up in heaven right
[1:13:50] that's right or a tree in the garden
[1:13:52] that we got to go to
[1:13:54] that tree is living and abiding in the
[1:13:56] believers of the end time
[1:13:58] amen that's right because the ones that
[1:14:00] are dead are going on and they're
[1:14:01] hanging on that tree absolutely but
[1:14:03] they're in their theophany
[1:14:05] they're standing there pure
[1:14:07] just like genesis 1 26
[1:14:11] where one time it drove us away from the
[1:14:13] tree until there could be reconciled to
[1:14:15] god through a blood sacrifice which was
[1:14:17] somebody that like brother claude always
[1:14:20] says that had the goods right
[1:14:22] jesus had the goods right he could back
[1:14:24] up everything he said glory he had the
[1:14:26] goods them caiphas and all them high
[1:14:28] priests i was thinking today i thought
[1:14:30] man
[1:14:32] the very ones that should have
[1:14:34] absolutely just fell at jesus's feet
[1:14:37] they were the highly religious they were
[1:14:39] the only religious people in the world
[1:14:41] there wasn't a religious sect over here
[1:14:44] that that that accepted jesus and one
[1:14:47] didn't all religions denied him
[1:14:50] just like they are today right that same
[1:14:53] one
[1:14:54] that motivated them is the same one
[1:14:56] that's motivating here remember the
[1:14:58] people die but the spirits lives on all
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:03] could be reconciled to god through a
[1:15:05] blood sacrifice and now the holy
[1:15:07] spirit's running us back to that tree
[1:15:10] i don't know how it's done
[1:15:12] i just believe it that's all
[1:15:15] that's the way to do it just simple
[1:15:18] faith we got to hurry all right let's go
[1:15:20] to the next one
[1:15:23] this is
[1:15:25] let's go to
[1:15:26] yeah there you go true and false witness
[1:15:28] the holy spirit guarded the tree of life
[1:15:30] until the atonement was made
[1:15:33] now who's he talking about jesus at
[1:15:35] calvary right
[1:15:36] that was the only atonement
[1:15:39] and now the holy spirit is running the
[1:15:40] people to the tree of life
[1:15:43] adam and eve was trying to get to the
[1:15:45] tree of life now their children are
[1:15:47] trying to stay away from the tree of
[1:15:49] life
[1:15:50] right the holy spirit was guarding it
[1:15:54] now it's bringing them to it and they
[1:15:56] refuse to hear the holy spirit's voice
[1:15:59] because the same adversary that caused
[1:16:01] them to sin in the beginning
[1:16:03] is keeping them away from the tree of
[1:16:05] life and jesus christ is
[1:16:08] the tree of life
[1:16:10] now here is the characteristics you say
[1:16:12] well i don't know if the holy spirit was
[1:16:13] a tree well i want you to watch this
[1:16:15] right here in adoption 1960.
[1:16:18] next one number nine
[1:16:20] god buys elected election grace called
[1:16:22] you god by his election election grace
[1:16:25] sanctified you god buys election grace
[1:16:27] and his power baptize you and put you
[1:16:29] into this land of rest they which have
[1:16:31] entered into this rest have ceased from
[1:16:33] their going astray they cease from their
[1:16:35] works like god did from his they have
[1:16:37] joy unspeakable and full of glory now is
[1:16:39] this a part of your life the tree of
[1:16:41] life is blooming in
[1:16:44] them
[1:16:48] that gives us an eternal quality
[1:16:51] exactly
[1:16:52] they have long suffering
[1:16:54] what this is fruits on the tree remember
[1:16:57] the fruits of the spirit love joy peace
[1:16:58] that's what he's saying all right they
[1:17:00] have long suffering gentle goodness
[1:17:02] patience faith faith faith meekness
[1:17:05] gentleness and so forth the tree of life
[1:17:07] is blooming in them because their hope
[1:17:09] is anchored in christ jesus the witness
[1:17:12] of the holy ghost bearing record with
[1:17:13] signs and wonders following the
[1:17:15] believers these signs shall follow them
[1:17:17] that believe as they go along they heal
[1:17:19] the sick they cast out devils we still
[1:17:21] believe in this amen
[1:17:22] they speak with tongues we still believe
[1:17:24] in that saying amen
[1:17:25] they see visions we still believe in
[1:17:27] that say amen they walk with god
[1:17:30] let's say amen
[1:17:32] they talk with god let's say amen
[1:17:34] no devil can move them amen wow this is
[1:17:37] a pretty powerful group of people
[1:17:39] they're steadfast looking for eternal
[1:17:41] life forgetting those things that are in
[1:17:43] the past they press toward the mark of
[1:17:45] the high calling in christ jesus there
[1:17:47] they are there they are that's that
[1:17:49] church
[1:17:50] now remember he's quoting scripture like
[1:17:51] dad said many times that's
[1:17:53] he's quoting scripture
[1:17:55] because he says forgetting those things
[1:17:56] which are past that's paul said that
[1:17:58] right okay
[1:17:59] so now
[1:18:00] let's go to number 10.
[1:18:03] now
[1:18:04] it would be funny
[1:18:06] i should have put this quote up in the
[1:18:07] front
[1:18:08] but it would be funny if these trees was
[1:18:11] just a natural tree of wood
[1:18:14] because you notice right here it says
[1:18:16] these cherubims that john saw here must
[1:18:18] have been interested in keeping the tree
[1:18:20] of life so they must be interested in
[1:18:22] human beings
[1:18:27] not spirits
[1:18:28] right not other trees right
[1:18:32] human beings
[1:18:33] are read genesis getting back to genesis
[1:18:35] again they kept the tree of life guarded
[1:18:37] it the way of life the way of life how
[1:18:39] is the way jesus said i am that way i am
[1:18:42] that bread that come from god out of
[1:18:43] heaven if a man eats this bread he'll
[1:18:45] live forever ever now there's a way back
[1:18:48] to that tree of life you get it
[1:18:50] all right now watch this right here now
[1:18:52] remember don't turn it up there yet
[1:18:55] genesis 3 15
[1:18:56] shows
[1:18:58] that i'll put god says i'll put enmity
[1:19:00] between what thy seed so the serpent had
[1:19:03] to have a seed because it said thy seed
[1:19:05] and the seed of the woman
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] which we
[1:19:10] put that is as christ
[1:19:13] coming
[1:19:14] as a baby
[1:19:16] right yeah
[1:19:18] christ the mystery of god reveal
[1:19:21] 1963
[1:19:24] now remember he is that tree of life
[1:19:26] contrary to the serpent seed you see
[1:19:28] he's that seed the woman's seed the tree
[1:19:30] of life in the garden
[1:19:36] you should be shouting
[1:19:39] there stood to see to the woman it
[1:19:41] didn't have to be what was coming that's
[1:19:43] what struck me the other day that's what
[1:19:44] struck me i read christ the mystery for
[1:19:46] probably a hundred times and i never
[1:19:48] read this quote
[1:19:50] unless they put forth their hand and
[1:19:52] moved this tree they'd eat that tree and
[1:19:54] live forever in other words they
[1:19:55] couldn't get back to that
[1:19:58] because of the serpent seed
[1:20:01] but god promised that he's going to send
[1:20:03] the seed of the woman but we thought
[1:20:04] well that's down here in
[1:20:06] december 25th when jesus was born well
[1:20:08] we know he wasn't born on december 25th
[1:20:10] anyway
[1:20:11] you know lambs were born in april
[1:20:14] they're not born december 25th remember
[1:20:16] that's the sun god's birthday not the
[1:20:17] son of god's birthday all right
[1:20:20] a catholic
[1:20:21] dogma that we still celebrate because
[1:20:24] the world does i like this kind of year
[1:20:26] you i told somebody the other day i said
[1:20:27] you throw me under the message bus if
[1:20:29] you want to back over me twice i don't
[1:20:30] care i like christmas
[1:20:35] some people will throw you under the bus
[1:20:36] and they'll you'll hear that
[1:20:39] they're backing up
[1:20:41] but anyway i'm still human that brother
[1:20:43] branham was human we're all human we're
[1:20:45] still human he is that tree of life
[1:20:47] contrary to the serpent seed you see
[1:20:49] he's that seed the woman's seed the tree
[1:20:52] of life in the garden he didn't have to
[1:20:54] wait to be born a baby we know he did
[1:20:57] but we know that god was standing in
[1:20:58] that garden and he was prophesying
[1:21:02] amen but he was standing there because
[1:21:04] he's the one that said that and he's the
[1:21:06] one that was born
[1:21:08] sometimes you say well well that was god
[1:21:10] talking there and that was jesus being
[1:21:12] born a baby no that was jesus talking
[1:21:13] there
[1:21:16] in the form of the father
[1:21:18] that's why he could say before abraham
[1:21:20] was i am
[1:21:21] that's why he could say he knew all
[1:21:22] these things
[1:21:23] unless they put forth their hand and
[1:21:25] moved this tree they'd eat that tree and
[1:21:26] live forever he's the only tree that can
[1:21:30] be taken
[1:21:31] that you can live forever
[1:21:34] his word is life
[1:21:35] and that be the word then the word of
[1:21:37] god which eve turned down in the garden
[1:21:40] then here is christ the word
[1:21:42] made manifest what a wonderful quote the
[1:21:45] woman's seed was the tree of life
[1:21:46] standing in the garden didn't have to
[1:21:48] wait
[1:21:49] it was already there amen
[1:21:53] i love god
[1:21:55] he knows what he's talking about
[1:21:59] and what he says has to come to pass
[1:22:02] so there it was standing in the garden
[1:22:04] right
[1:22:04] the tree of life is the woman's seed
[1:22:07] standing right there in the garden of
[1:22:08] eden
[1:22:09] but he couldn't be our brother there he
[1:22:11] had to become flesh remember the last
[1:22:13] quote he had to become flesh
[1:22:15] because we fell in flesh adam didn't
[1:22:17] fall in his soul
[1:22:21] adam fell in his
[1:22:22] flesh amen amen his soul was eternal he
[1:22:26] said why how can he do that
[1:22:29] you and i do wrong don't we right
[1:22:32] that's right
[1:22:35] he was trying to save his wife right all
[1:22:38] right so it's not so much that
[1:22:40] that uh
[1:22:42] we're immune to things but
[1:22:45] adam was the son of god and that's what
[1:22:46] the bible says
[1:22:47] so i take the bible brother brother
[1:22:49] claude i love brother claude because he
[1:22:50] always said he said faith's final
[1:22:52] resting place is in the word of god
[1:22:54] you take a quote that seems contrary to
[1:22:57] the word you go to the word and let the
[1:23:00] word reveal i said reveal the quote to
[1:23:02] you all right so face final resting
[1:23:04] place places in the word of god all
[1:23:06] right so if adam was the son of god then
[1:23:09] and you and i are son of god then
[1:23:12] we all come
[1:23:14] that
[1:23:16] way with the holy ghost with eternal
[1:23:18] life there's not two eternal life adam
[1:23:21] didn't have a lesser eternal life and
[1:23:22] thus a greater one
[1:23:24] no he create he control things
[1:23:26] see and that's what we're coming back to
[1:23:28] because remember the holy ghost has been
[1:23:30] bound
[1:23:31] the prophet said for two thousand years
[1:23:33] well remember it was loosed on the day
[1:23:34] of pentecost right
[1:23:36] the holy ghost was loosed on the day of
[1:23:37] pentecost the tree of life came into
[1:23:40] view
[1:23:41] on the day of pentecost
[1:23:43] but down through the church ages man has
[1:23:46] injected their own idea just like
[1:23:48] there's old satan you remember satan
[1:23:50] don't take vacations you might and i
[1:23:51] might but satan doesn't
[1:23:54] when you're not at church he's sitting
[1:23:55] here
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:58] he's always here
[1:24:03] all right let's finish right here
[1:24:07] 1964 is a man here that can turn on
[1:24:09] light
[1:24:11] i like that other quote though that's a
[1:24:13] good quote from christ the mystery how
[1:24:15] many of you read that before yeah
[1:24:18] okay
[1:24:21] god's wonderful
[1:24:23] he'll reveal it to you if you'll just
[1:24:25] wait well i've read that 47 times well
[1:24:27] you know what he may come to you on the
[1:24:30] 48th
[1:24:32] exactly he just may be waiting on
[1:24:34] something to clear out of the way
[1:24:37] so that he can talk to you because you
[1:24:38] know what you and i
[1:24:41] control how god talks to us
[1:24:46] no remember you're god's right
[1:24:51] so i told him that brother tom crushing
[1:24:53] that you see the bible says grieve not
[1:24:55] the holy spirit of god brother brown
[1:24:57] said the holy ghost was timid that he
[1:24:59] was a gentleman and and the holy ghost
[1:25:01] would go out on a limb if you do
[1:25:02] something wrong and you start
[1:25:03] misbehaving now he doesn't leave you and
[1:25:06] go it's a metaphor
[1:25:09] in other words he goes somewhere where
[1:25:10] you can't find him for a little while
[1:25:13] because you you you get these thoughts
[1:25:15] from god and you get in the channel and
[1:25:17] everything's going great and then the
[1:25:19] kids start screaming and the wife starts
[1:25:20] screaming and you know this one calls
[1:25:23] you and the lights go off and the air
[1:25:25] condition well what is that that's the
[1:25:27] devil
[1:25:28] he sees god coming before you do oh yeah
[1:25:32] right
[1:25:33] bro chris said amen so everyone should
[1:25:36] say amen amen remember satan is a
[1:25:38] spiritual being he's not an idiot
[1:25:41] he's a spiritual being so he feels that
[1:25:43] spiritual
[1:25:44] part of god coming to you and then he
[1:25:47] tries to cut that thing off
[1:25:49] right right maybe some of you not
[1:25:53] maybe i'm a little different i guess but
[1:25:56] it's the way it happens to me
[1:25:58] satan seems to get there first
[1:26:01] but you know what somewhere in there
[1:26:02] like brother brown said i can't explain
[1:26:04] it he said but somewhere in there god
[1:26:05] comes through all that right and you
[1:26:07] read christ the mystery god revealed you
[1:26:09] know what you may be reading it one day
[1:26:12] and
[1:26:13] angelic
[1:26:14] beings start
[1:26:15] appearing and and everything's just so
[1:26:18] nice and sweet and you don't get a thing
[1:26:19] from the sermon yeah
[1:26:22] but you may be like brother brown told
[1:26:24] that guy he said you fought your way
[1:26:25] here
[1:26:26] right well the guy said i didn't just
[1:26:27] got in the car and come to work but he
[1:26:28] just didn't realize the spiritual world
[1:26:30] those demons were fighting
[1:26:32] in that spiritual world you don't think
[1:26:34] there's demons oh yeah geez i'm looking
[1:26:36] at a bunch of them
[1:26:38] i'm looking at all of us
[1:26:40] but we are
[1:26:42] we have a lot of demons that we need to
[1:26:43] get rid of we all do
[1:26:46] all right
[1:26:47] so we've got to fight that though
[1:26:48] remember the kingdom of god is taken by
[1:26:51] force
[1:26:52] joshua did not tell those people go into
[1:26:54] that land and possess that land and the
[1:26:56] people are just going to fall over dead
[1:26:58] you're not going to have to fight no
[1:27:00] they fought for every inch but now god
[1:27:02] promised them he said if you'll keep
[1:27:04] under joshua's control which is the holy
[1:27:06] ghost he said if you'll keep under his
[1:27:08] control you won't lose a man
[1:27:10] but they still had to fight
[1:27:12] what a miracle that's a better miracle
[1:27:14] than to walk in and people just fall
[1:27:16] over
[1:27:17] what a miracle brother marty today was
[1:27:19] 600 000 people killed in the civil war
[1:27:22] 600 000
[1:27:23] killed
[1:27:25] joshua fought battles just like that
[1:27:28] maybe not with the same armament but
[1:27:29] they were hand to hand it was close
[1:27:31] combat with them they didn't lose a man
[1:27:34] until aiken did what he did they didn't
[1:27:36] lose nobody
[1:27:38] i mean you go out there with 5 000 men
[1:27:39] you figure well i may come back with 4
[1:27:42] 000 on a good day
[1:27:43] on a good day you send five out five
[1:27:46] comes back send eight out eight comes
[1:27:48] back
[1:27:49] but see remember they got out aiken got
[1:27:52] out from under the leadership of the
[1:27:53] holy spirit
[1:27:54] right
[1:27:55] and thought he could do something over
[1:27:57] here and he couldn't got found out about
[1:27:59] it okay
[1:28:02] somebody said one time said remember now
[1:28:04] aiken was in the land
[1:28:08] he just messed up
[1:28:11] so think about that
[1:28:12] turn on the light man here they can turn
[1:28:14] on the light this is the last one
[1:28:16] sorry to hold you a little bit long i
[1:28:18] was going to try to quit it's a bride
[1:28:19] tree jesus was the bride he was a tree
[1:28:22] jesus was the bride
[1:28:24] yeah
[1:28:26] he's the one that makes us bride right
[1:28:28] they cut him down he was the tree of
[1:28:30] life that was in the garden of eden they
[1:28:32] cut him down and hung him on a roman
[1:28:34] tree to make fun of him
[1:28:36] what did he do god raised him up on the
[1:28:38] third day from the dead and today
[1:28:41] there's a bride tree
[1:28:42] it started back there at the beginning
[1:28:44] way back at the day of pentecost
[1:28:48] all right
[1:28:48] so now let's turn to revelations 22
[1:28:50] because this is going to show you that
[1:28:52] it's the holy ghost all the way through
[1:28:54] from the beginning to the end you read

[1:29:31] put it on my ipad to bring it here
[1:29:32] tonight so if you understand all that
[1:29:34] praise lord
[1:29:38] but i didn't have but i don't have my
[1:29:40] but i think the uh sunday school class
[1:29:42] for getting men an ipad that's what i
[1:29:44] wanted for christmas and they so
[1:29:45] graciously uh thanks to
[1:29:47] all the brothers and sisters that go to
[1:29:49] my sunday school class i've always
[1:29:51] wanted one because the reason i do is

[1:30:02] for
[1:30:03] putting sermons in
[1:30:05] and checking emails and stuff from
[1:30:07] people all right so revelations 22
[1:30:10] this is now
[1:30:12] where are we at now
[1:30:14] now we were in the garden of eden with a
[1:30:16] tree of life right and it was the holy
[1:30:18] ghost
[1:30:19] it was eternal life right it hasn't
[1:30:21] changed
[1:30:22] so now
[1:30:23] what is going to be
[1:30:26] excuse me what is going to be in the
[1:30:28] future home
[1:30:30] the holy ghost
[1:30:32] everybody that has the holy ghost is
[1:30:34] going to be inside the city right
[1:30:36] so watch what appears inside the city
[1:30:41] verse two in the midst of the street of
[1:30:43] it and on either side now what what it
[1:30:45] is is
[1:30:46] john has already seen the city come down
[1:30:48] right let's go back to revelations back
[1:30:50] here in 21 and i saw a new heaven and a
[1:30:52] new earth we don't believe brother that
[1:30:54] we're going to heaven
[1:30:57] because the bible says heaven and earth
[1:30:58] will pass away
[1:31:00] but we're coming to a new heaven and a
[1:31:02] new earth
[1:31:03] which is going to be this earth
[1:31:04] this is where we're going to live you
[1:31:06] say well how do you know that well
[1:31:07] that's where adam started
[1:31:08] adam was the god of the earth he lost it
[1:31:10] guess what
[1:31:12] redemption
[1:31:14] is not replacement
[1:31:16] god's going to redeem everything that
[1:31:18] adam lost and bring us right back to the
[1:31:20] adam condition
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:23] and we're going to rule and reign on
[1:31:24] this earth this is where glory is going
[1:31:27] to be we're not going to walk around on
[1:31:28] a cloud what a boring thing i'm sorry
[1:31:33] and play harps
[1:31:35] i can't hardly play spoons
[1:31:38] but
[1:31:39] no we're gonna live right here as human
[1:31:41] beings we're gonna live on this earth
[1:31:44] enjoying all this in the bible
[1:31:47] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:31:49] for the first heaven and her first earth
[1:31:50] would pass away revelation 21 and there
[1:31:52] was no more sea and i john saw the holy
[1:31:54] city new jerusalem coming down where was
[1:31:57] john
[1:31:58] on the earth
[1:32:00] coming down from
[1:32:03] god out of heaven prepared as a bride a
[1:32:06] dorm for a husband now
[1:32:08] he's showing all the things that's
[1:32:09] inside the city and he showed me a pure
[1:32:11] river of water clears crystal produ
[1:32:13] proceeding out of the throne of god and
[1:32:15] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[1:32:17] of it and on either side of the river
[1:32:19] was there the tree of life
[1:32:22] which bears 12 matters of fruit and
[1:32:24] yielded their fruit every month and the
[1:32:26] leaves of the tree were for the healing
[1:32:28] of the nations
[1:32:29] now you can believe that's a natural
[1:32:31] tree if you want to that's okay
[1:32:34] but whatever it is
[1:32:36] if it's not eternal
[1:32:39] the branches are all going to be gone
[1:32:40] after a while
[1:32:43] let's just be sensible right
[1:32:45] all right
[1:32:46] you can believe it's a real one or you
[1:32:47] believe it's us whichever one you want
[1:32:49] to believe because there's 12 tribes
[1:32:51] there's 12
[1:32:52] apostles
[1:32:54] okay it's just something to think about
[1:32:55] because we don't have time it's almost
[1:32:56] nine o'clock was there the tree of life
[1:32:58] which bear twelve matter of fruit and
[1:33:00] yielded their fruit because remember you
[1:33:02] can't fruit doesn't heal a nation
[1:33:05] but the fruits of the spirit heals a
[1:33:06] nation
[1:33:08] love joy peace long suffering meekness
[1:33:10] gentleness and what that those kings do
[1:33:13] they come in and they get that glory and
[1:33:15] honor and they take it back out
[1:33:17] and they say hey people there's a group
[1:33:19] in there
[1:33:22] that's right
[1:33:24] this god right that's right
[1:33:28] man what did you see
[1:33:31] i just saw one person in that whole city
[1:33:34] no
[1:33:35] there's millions
[1:33:37] upon millions
[1:33:39] upon millions
[1:33:41] it says not as seeds as of many but one
[1:33:43] seed christ so when they see the
[1:33:46] multiplying
[1:33:47] of god it's god
[1:33:51] let's go back to genesis 1. let us make
[1:33:52] man in our own image let him multiply
[1:33:54] and replenish the earth that's what that
[1:33:56] was
[1:33:58] it just got stopped in the garden by
[1:34:00] satan
[1:34:01] he actually stopped sons and daughters
[1:34:02] of god from being born in the garden
[1:34:05] but he didn't stop god from coming down
[1:34:07] into satan's eden
[1:34:09] satan went into god's eden and messed it
[1:34:11] up now god's coming right down into
[1:34:12] satan's eden
[1:34:14] and he's going to have a group of people
[1:34:15] he said the world will see me no more
[1:34:17] but you'll see me because i'll be with
[1:34:19] you even in you
[1:34:20] to the end of the age and then what's
[1:34:21] going to do it's going to carry it right
[1:34:23] up here to the tree of life and
[1:34:25] everybody that lives in that city has
[1:34:26] got the holy ghost
[1:34:28] born again
[1:34:29] here
[1:34:30] not some purgatory that we were prayed
[1:34:32] into
[1:34:34] just randy you know all that
[1:34:36] she was a catholic before what a pitiful
[1:34:39] thing
[1:34:40] you can act like you want to kill as
[1:34:41] many people as you want to
[1:34:43] you can smoke drink cuss run around with
[1:34:45] women do whatever but when you die
[1:34:47] you go into purgatory and then we'll
[1:34:49] clean you up once you get in there
[1:34:53] my hope is built on nothing less than
[1:34:56] jesus blood and righteousness not some
[1:34:58] purgatory
[1:35:00] no
[1:35:01] no give me god here amen not there
[1:35:04] that's right give me god here because if
[1:35:06] i got god here brother gary he'll take
[1:35:08] me there
[1:35:09] i got a free ride
[1:35:11] i got a free ride on the tree of life
[1:35:13] and it'll take me right into the
[1:35:15] paradises of god then you've got
[1:35:17] revelation 22. i got to hurry verse 12
[1:35:20] through 15 behold i come quickly now
[1:35:22] look watch this and behold i come
[1:35:24] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[1:35:27] every man according as his work shall be
[1:35:30] i am alpha and omega i'm the tree of
[1:35:32] life in the beginning i'm the tree of
[1:35:34] life in the end i am alpha and omega the
[1:35:36] beginning and the end the first and the
[1:35:37] last bless now where did i where did you
[1:35:39] see that word when we first started and
[1:35:42] god blessed them right right where'd
[1:35:44] that word bless come from all the way
[1:35:45] now it's right back into the into the
[1:35:47] garden into the garden of god now
[1:35:49] blessed are they that do his
[1:35:51] commandments that they may have right to
[1:35:54] the tree of life and may enter in
[1:35:57] through the gates into the city
[1:36:01] for without or dogs and sorcerers and
[1:36:03] whoremongers and murderers and
[1:36:04] adulterers or whatever loveth and make
[1:36:06] us a lie
[1:36:07] now that scripture has always bothered
[1:36:10] me
[1:36:12] because inside the city it says the tree
[1:36:14] of life and there's the people live that
[1:36:15] has the holy ghost
[1:36:17] but i you know i told claud the other
[1:36:20] day i said i hate you
[1:36:22] with a godly hate
[1:36:24] because he can sit at home he's retired
[1:36:27] he's only 57 he's retired but he can sit
[1:36:30] all day in research
[1:36:32] scriptures
[1:36:33] uh anything in the on the internet he
[1:36:35] can research and he says and researches
[1:36:38] all this
[1:36:39] but
[1:36:40] the way he sees it and i see it the same
[1:36:42] way because remember the people that are
[1:36:44] given eternal life for a cup of water in
[1:36:47] my name and all those things like that
[1:36:50] they're still what they were but god has
[1:36:52] given them eternal life
[1:36:55] they were dogs they were sorcerers they
[1:36:56] were whoremongers and murders but you
[1:36:58] know what somewhere down the line a
[1:37:00] murderer is going to get eternal life
[1:37:02] you say all murders can't enter into the
[1:37:03] kingdom well they won't
[1:37:06] but they were right but they won't know
[1:37:09] anything about jesus christ and what a
[1:37:10] blessed thing you and i can do is take
[1:37:12] them up under a tree somewhere and sit
[1:37:14] down let's stand
[1:37:16] set them under a tree
[1:37:18] that tree of life
[1:37:19] not a tree of life we got to go to you
[1:37:22] and i are the tree of life
[1:37:25] come on we got to believe this thing is
[1:37:27] more personal than we've ever believed
[1:37:29] in our life that the tree of life is not
[1:37:32] something up there somewhere that we got
[1:37:33] to go to
[1:37:35] it's right here and it's going to
[1:37:38] transform us off of the tree of
[1:37:40] knowledge of good and evil right that's
[1:37:42] right
[1:37:43] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:37:45] what this is what we thought before but
[1:37:48] now this is the way we think now because
[1:37:49] we have a part of the thinker
[1:37:52] the very one the very one that wrote
[1:37:55] this bible
[1:37:57] dwells in you and i right
[1:37:59] the very one that wrote the bible
[1:38:02] the very one that created
[1:38:05] heaven and earth
[1:38:08] the very one dwells in you and me
[1:38:12] what you got
[1:38:18] oh there was a uh request sister
[1:38:20] charlotte called that's why they're not
[1:38:22] here tonight brother richard marlow is
[1:38:24] going tomorrow to the kidney specialist
[1:38:27] to have some test run looks like or
[1:38:29] going to kidney specialist tomorrow so
[1:38:30] we need to keep him in our prayers it
[1:38:32] was uh brother richard's not here
[1:38:33] tonight he sent me a text and said that
[1:38:35] he would be listening in so we'll be
[1:38:37] praying for you buddy
[1:38:39] still god still believe god heals
[1:38:41] that tree of life never got sick
[1:38:44] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:38:45] got sick
[1:38:46] the tree of life never got sick now if
[1:38:48] we have the tree of life in us that's
[1:38:50] what we're gonna have to see if we got
[1:38:52] that in us residing
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:55] residing in us we have the same power he
[1:38:57] has right
[1:39:00] amen right
[1:39:02] that's my whole thing
[1:39:04] when i saw that the other day i thought
[1:39:06] man
[1:39:07] god had it all wrapped up in that tree
[1:39:10] of life standing in the garden
[1:39:13] man what a confidence we ought to have
[1:39:16] what a confidence we ought to have we
[1:39:18] ought to be so confident not arrogant
[1:39:21] but confident
[1:39:22] that god's going to do what he said he's
[1:39:24] not going to do it through a tree
[1:39:28] or a blade of grass
[1:39:29] or a cow it's good to have cows but
[1:39:31] that's okay they're not filled with the
[1:39:33] holy ghost
[1:39:35] but people
[1:39:36] that will do what god said
[1:39:39] and it'll be led
[1:39:41] and guided
[1:39:43] by the same one that said let there be
[1:39:45] light
[1:39:47] i've always said and it'll it'll strike
[1:39:49] you one day the reason we can read this
[1:39:52] bible with with spiritual intelligence
[1:39:55] is because the one that wrote it is
[1:39:57] inside of you
[1:40:00] paul said we have the mind of christ
[1:40:03] glory and the mind this is the mind of
[1:40:05] christ
[1:40:06] that's why we can look at that tree of
[1:40:08] life and we can see all these
[1:40:10] characteristics of that tree
[1:40:13] brother ryan it's not somewhere moses
[1:40:15] even said you ain't got to go get it you
[1:40:16] ain't got to go find it
[1:40:18] hey that's not thee
[1:40:20] even in the mouth the word of faith that
[1:40:22] we preach what we got that's right
[1:40:25] 2 30 in the red book i've about lost my
[1:40:27] voice

[1:45:03] he's a healer
[1:45:06] and he'll supply our needs
[1:45:08] but you know what
[1:45:12] he's already done it
[1:45:15] that tree of life if you eat off of that
[1:45:17] tree
[1:45:18] he's already done it now if you eat off
[1:45:20] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:45:21] the doctor says maybe we can help you
[1:45:25] because remember it's a practice
[1:45:27] right
[1:45:29] yeah
[1:45:31] that's right
[1:45:32] that's right
[1:45:33] you've lived a long time without help
[1:45:36] from doctors right it's been help from
[1:45:38] the almighty glory right we all
[1:45:41] you know what we're one breath from
[1:45:43] death
[1:45:44] we all are one breath from going out of
[1:45:46] here
[1:45:47] one breath life is so precious let's
[1:45:49] remember that in this uh this time of uh
[1:45:52] of holiday season that uh jesus is the
[1:45:55] reason for the season but he's 24 7 for
[1:45:57] us do what
[1:45:59] he is yeah he's the reason for any straw
[1:46:02] season he's a reason for the season of
[1:46:04] us getting out of here
[1:46:05] all right so we love you with the love
[1:46:07] of the lord just greet our visitor as he
[1:46:09] as we go out the door and tell him god
[1:46:11] bless you and always uh seats available
[1:46:13] for anybody who wants to come we
[1:46:15] appreciate visitors coming and
[1:46:17] we may seem a little crazy sometimes but
[1:46:21] paul said in a way it's called heresy
[1:46:24] in other words crazy people
[1:46:27] and the way it's called heresy paul had
[1:46:28] to forget everything he knew
[1:46:31] paul had to literally forget his phd his
[1:46:35] lld he had to forget all that because
[1:46:37] that's what got him in trouble
[1:46:39] he forgot that but he never now remember
[1:46:42] he never got illiterate
[1:46:45] he didn't he didn't become dumb
[1:46:48] no what god done is he used what paul
[1:46:51] had
[1:46:52] and paul yielded to him he said we have
[1:46:54] the mind of christ and paul could sit
[1:46:55] and pen 80 of the new testament
[1:46:58] right god god through paul could pen 80
[1:47:02] he yielded himself so much
[1:47:04] because paul kept saying paul a prisoner
[1:47:07] of christ
[1:47:08] now if you and i if you're a prisoner
[1:47:10] you've done forfeited all your rights
