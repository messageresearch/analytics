brother Wade and the Dells permission just right before he comes out we were at a man's meeting just a few weeks ago there in in Hickory North Carolina and of course you meet a lot of different brothers from around the country who come there they just want to be better man better ministers better that her father's better husbands you know and so and I met this one brother there from his from Lorraine Ohio and his name is brother Isaac he's a Puerto Rican brother and when I told him who I was and and and I told him the church that I've come to he said oh my you're that you're that you go to that church where my dad has been listening to for last four years I said really he said yeah he said my dad my dad um he said he appreciates brother Wade and brother Dale's ministry over there he listens to them all the time he said and so so we just kind of let we kind of talked a little bit more left it at that well when when the meetings were over to Wednesdays ago he called me when I was coming to church and he said hey brother Luis I have my dad here brother brother Rick Richard is his name you want to say hello to him say yes yes so I was talking to him he said brother Luis it's good - it's good to meet you I said I'm gonna tell you brother you guys have such a great ministry over there he said he said for the last few years I've been on a message for the four flight 43 years I think he's been in the message but he said uh he said that he's always had that struggle whether he made mistakes outside the body but making that differentiation that you're born again in the soul you see what I'm saying and that he struggled with that for so many years and it wasn't until arted listening to the ministry here that kind of really broke that down to him and really solidified his walk with Christ it's not that he doesn't go to a church over there he does but he also turns in to listen in and he said you know brother Luis one time one time I was uh I was listening and I was falling asleep and I was listening to brother Wade and I was falling asleep and he was talking about the stature of a perfect man he said when I fell asleep brother Louise I heard something say wake up and they were it was brother Wade and he said brother Luis when he said that I woke up and and I just it kept me up and I stayed listening and from then on I had not seen the Statue of perfectman the same since then he said and I said brother I said brother Richard you know for the wait sometimes he says that it may be for the people here but it was that was for you brother Richard all the way in Ohio so he he told me that and I said you know what by the way it'll probably get a kick out of that but uh he wants to come and just visit at some time and I told him I said you brother you're always welcome and so you pray for them pray for brother Richard brother Isaac they also have another son that I spoke with he's younger and just precious brethren so I just wanted to share that because I thought you know sometimes we think that it's just us here they're you know they're being blessed that are there are being receiving you know what God speaks through this pulpit but you know there's others that are listening in as well and you don't know maybe of a service that I believe that statue of a perfect man was supposed it was in 2015 and that was just recently where where he was getting it and you see something from 2015 still has an effect your voice say man whatever you say now a man steal carries has weight to it amen so you're gonna add a file with your words are you gonna not edify with your words amen praise God so let's stand to our feet is where the weight comes let's sing open the eyes of my heart [Music] open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my

forgot I forgot why I did that don't be don't laugh so much Rebecca good grief I think that funny you notice people get is funny when you get older people's you know it's funny this people's older guys over older people do stuff and they go it's just old young people do it would smack them in the head you know old people do stuff funny and they go oh you just so I guess I'm getting the neck group huh Boyd you're already in that group so I hear you mumbling back there I ain't lost my hair oh it's not even back there well you know why when you get older you start hearing voices too you know you start hearing things so anyway good to be in house with Lord if y'all show cans today okay all right let's turn to the Book of Daniel and get started real quick we got communion today does anyone not have the chart some of you have not been here in the afternoon so if you need a chart that we're going to talk about today you can have one for you and also the one of the day of 70 weeks if you want one just raise your hand we'll get you one all right we got a few Thomas brother Thomas can do that Tom book Thomas do that when they raise your hand just hand him one okay and one of these too fair want one of these two he go yeah there you go Oh brother Thomas he likes to do stuff for people all right while he's giving those out our Sunday School class from now on I know you young the young ones get out early but we had been pushing toward like 10:30 and and I think to get more continuity of the service in the morning we're obviously still starting at 9:45 so I want to tell you parents make sure you don't kids don't wobble in at 10 o'clock in 1005 because it breaks the continuity even of the service downstairs start at nine forty five sons who class will now end at ten fifteen at ten fifteen then we'll all come up here that way we can start having worship a little bit earlier we can worship brother Joe does a real good job I just don't want a lot of at 10:30 there's a lot of in and out in and out so if we will do it at 10:15 I give us 30 minutes to have Sunday school we don't need to have preaching downstairs we just need to have Sundays go alright so now I'm 45 to 10:15 but make sure you get 9:45 when it starts okay and then 10-15 will dismiss and all come upstairs and we can start singing before we bring brother Dale out it just gives a lot less confusion if we're not moving around so much before the service starts we'll remember that ten fifteen I've already talked to Boyd about it so he knows also November 2nd and 3rd I know it you say boss November but you know what it's only about three weeks from now and I'm not gonna say what's that other word in December is so we're not gonna worry about that one for right now November the 2nd the 3rd remember is our youth weekend we will be starting at 2 o'clock on Saturday we will have something to eat and we may have a guest speaker for that day just for a little while ok we'll settle just a bit and then brother rush dunkers gonna be here with us that weekend from from Minnesota we menace order you got it you gotta be able I'll say Minnesota he's from Minnesota but also remembers the Fall Festival we're going to meet next Sunday again for those of you that have a responsibility next Sunday at 1:15 110 we're gonna meet downstairs in Sunday school class to kind of solidify all the what people are gonna do and bringing all the stuff and yadda yadda yadda so I don't want to tell you something brother Dale was talking about this morning summit brotherly kindness and the church he's referring to I started preaching that a while back well 10 or 12 so many years ago and they came from that old and I'm gonna name it that came from they came from all came from Arkansas so it was basically the women said on this side and the men said on this side and when he went outside two men went in this court and women went in this court and that's true didn't it so anybody when you walk up to shake their hands I can't fall back far enough they were like hello brother god bless you have you know never said love you so I thought well so dad started coming out and he preached from a couple of times and he's a big guy you know and they don't want to run they can't run from him he's two pastors over the church now the other discharge you know so anyway he grabs them and hugs them and says I love you and God bless you know what that broke that whole church it didn't break their back anymore no now they're just they're just a loving Church and you know what that's showing brotherly kindness that's taking brotherly kindness and giving it to somebody else and you know what they were spirit-filled people they had just had a little problem with saying god bless you and we love you you know it's hard for a man to say if you do that out in the world you're funny they consider you they consider you another word if you tell another man you love them but in godly love we were telling them in godly love and now you go to that church and I mean they're just you know the men and all and then but that's what broke it was a brother Dale going out and just making him I mean he'd pull them you know you'd do that rope pull you know he'd pull them in and and after a while they became I think wasn't if they weren't a loving Church yes I agree they wonder if they weren't a loving Church it's just when when you start and you get talked a little bit deeper and a little bit deeper the Holy Spirit's inside of you says hey we're missing something here we're missing the love of the Brethren where we can hug each other's neck and say I love you and godly love and be right with that so that broke the whole thing out there and they're just a beautiful loving Church so you say well you shouldn't well we did we did do that we did go out there and tell them we loved we invaded their pulpit we but we were invited but they just weren't brought up under that you or not you were not brought up under that you were brought to brought up to be a loving group of people and men being able to hug men and godly you know I have a I have a problem sometimes you know the Bible talks about giving the godly kiss yes I've I know it's in the Bible but a man kissing the man just home but you know if it sent done in godly love then just like the same way with that I'm telling you when you shook those people's hands it was like that's all you're getting just shake my hand but now they're a very loving group of people and they're pastors just doing really well and and he's projecting that love so we you know he lives them a sermon he didn't have to read him in the Bible he didn't go out there and preach 70 weeks of Daniel or I mean a statue of perfect man he just went out lived it just went live the I'd rather live a statue of bourbon man there's somebody preach it all the time coming you know so let's get started in 70 weeks here of Daniel hmm we're gonna go through the six fold purpose again because a lot of you weren't here last weekend but that's okay part four six fold purpose Daniel 9:24 unless the bow our heads and pray dear lord thank you for this day thank you for the people that you put in this building Lord to hear from you father and I pray today that they will hear from you Lord and not a man that you'll come off of those pages and come out of those words and be Lord alive where for each one of us a revelation Lord that we can contain and put in our heart and go from day to day father we pray that you'd be with the ones that are not here be with the ones that are sick the ones that are in the foreign fields Lord we pray that you'd give them fruit for their labor bless each one this here father and just give us grace today as we take communion father I pray that you would just forgive us all of our sins and our shortcomings that we do against you Lord that you'll cleanse us sanctifies for this journey we ask these things in Jesus name Amen Daniel seventy weeks all right because I believe if we get this six fold purpose then as we go on through it'll be easier to understand I I was talking to brother Russ this week and he said he said well just really what what's going on here I said well it's Redemption this is the total full plan of redemption because we worry about our plan of redemption which is the seven church ages but God started redeeming at Calvary and worked all the way from the foundation of the world because it was a lamb slain before the foundation the world's he was gonna have I redeemed the bride he was going to have a Israel to be redeemed and he's going to have a world that's going to be redeemed so Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city so remember always two things people and city the number one finish the transgression number two make an end of sins number three make reconciliation for iniquity number four to bring in everlasting righteousness number five to seal up the vision and prophecy and number six to six to north the most holy that's all of Daniels 70 weeks that's it seventy weeks are determined to do these six things and that's it but this next 25 26 and 27 is going to show you how it's done God's going to explain or through Gabriel to Daniel to us he's going to explain how it's done know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks that's one one period and threescore and two weeks that's the second period and I was telling the church downstairs people downstairs listen in all of Daniel 70 weeks in this whole Bible there is no half weeks in this 70 weeks of Daniel read it there's none there all four weeks all right she'll be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks which is 62 and seven is how much 69 the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times we will get into all that a little bit later and after threescore in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off who was that Jesus Christ at Calvary but not for himself who was he cut off for you and me and the people of the prince that shall come now this is another press this is not the Messiah this is another Prince shall destroy the city in the sanctuary we know that Titus in AD 70 and the end thereof shall be with the flood into the end of the war desolations are determined you know here's the last period and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and one week is what seven years one week equals seven years all right according to the Bible we've already read it in the Bible that Jacob fulfilled the week to get Rachel and what was it seven years all right so brother Branham didn't come up with one week equal seven years it's always been in the Bible the the angel of the Lord just showed it to him put light on it and he said hey one week equals seven years that's why we're gonna stay try to stay in the Bible with this for a for more than we did the last time we did this he shall confirm now who is that he that's the Antichrist that's not Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ never breaks the Covenant right God never breaks the Covenant man always breaks the Covenant so this man this he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that's the week we're going to talk about today and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so let's get started real quick I want to just go back a few minutes and recap so let's pull up in chronicles the Bible is already telling us what's going to happen to Israel Israel was God's bride right at first Israel was God's bride he had to divorce her he had to put her away for prostitution are going after what other idols going after other countries going after other things that were not of God so when she went and polluted herself God keep marry her back he gave her a bill of writing of divorcement we've been through that he'd give her a writing of divorcement put her away but he can't forget her though he even says I found married to you I can't in other words I can divorce you but you're still there and I'm not going to forget you because I'm going to redeem you laughter I get my Gentile bride I'm going to bring Redemption to a group of people called 144,000 but in second chronicles God is telling us in the Old Testament therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men our maiden old man or him that stoop for age he gave them all into his hand in other words God fixed and dispersed Israel and all the vessels of the house of God because remember Daniel is two parts to the people and the city they got that same Inn and all the vessels of the house of God great and small and the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King and of his princes all these he brought to Babylon so in other words the King comes and just destroys Jerusalem and takes everything back to Babylon all right but now they're gonna return and they burnt the house of God and break down the walls of Jerusalem and burn all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof in other words when Daniel is writing this Daniel 9:24 he's not even in Jerusalem he's in captivity he can't see the temple but he knows that it's been destroyed because jeremiah said it was going to be destroyed Chronicle said it was going to be destroyed so he knows that he's standing in Daniel 9:24 and Gabriel has given this instruction to him and he knows that the city is laying in waste and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem because they got to build it back according to Daniel 9:24 they got to build a wall back and burn all the palaces there with fire destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and then that had escaped from the sword carried me away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia if you remember about the time of Esther remember the that was about that time where the Chaldeans and the Medes and the Persians got together in the book of Esther remember they were dispersed they weren't some people it's time tonight some people the some of the commentaries say a lot of the vagrants for the people that didn't have houses or the people that were homeless stayed in Jerusalem they were just in slums though they were not in houses they were in slums but a lot of the people remember were taken away from Babylon and that's what Esther was trying to do the King Haman or Haman was trying to tell the King hey these people need to be destroyed see the devil that Haman is trying to keep Israel from coming back into their homeland alright and according to what Esther said Esther said well hey the King says I can't take my word back right but Esther said just give them an opportunity to defend themselves and remember when you give Israel an opportunity to defend themself God is going to be with them and that's what same way now you know this little spot according to the world it's just a spot and there's a lot of people hate them but there's a lot of people fear Israel even at this moment because they know that what somewhere underlying in there somewhere God is working for those people he hasn't forgotten and then they had escaped from the sword carried away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land remember the land had enjoyed her Sabbath for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years which is 70 years three scores two times sixty three times sixty sorry three score three times two sixty and then 10 makes seventy so there's our seventy years in captivity everybody got that that was the 70 years they were determined that they were going to be there but remember what happened now brother Brown said God thought so much of Daniel 2 when he sent Gabriel to visit Daniel he didn't just tell him he was going to get out in two years he told him what was going to happen all the way to the Millennium all right he told him the whole thing the whole redemption of Israel the whole 490 years of Redemption because seventy times seven is 490 all right so those seventy weeks are determined but I want to read you this next one we're going to read these two every time because we're going to remember one thing for sure God's words eternal it cannot be changed it will not be changed never will be changed it is the finality the prophet of God tells us God's final resting places in the Word of God all right not in a quote the first name will wish to draw your attention to is the infallibility of God's Word God keeps his word to the letter and tonight we'll want to fasten our thoughts on that that God keeps his word we can rest assure of one thing that God has said in his word to be that anything God said in his word to be truth and faith does not rest upon the shifting sands of man's idea or man's theology but it has this final resting place on the unmovable rock of God's eternal word the word so anything we hear contrary to the word is wrong okay anything we hear contrary the word is wrong all right that's why I want to make that basis because look in number two God hiding himself in simplicity he's getting ready to preach the seals what is he telling the people if God said there would be rain for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and faith takes its final resting place on the Word of God there's where it finds its resting place so we're gonna we're going to put it on the Word of God not man's ideas and William Marion Branham was a prophet from God he was a word prophet I say the word was he still is he didn't lose his prophet ship by being in another dimension and then neither did Samuel or any of them they lose their prophet ship he's still a prophet but while he was here on earth he gave us 1,100 servants he gave us clarity why is there so much confusion in this message he didn't bring confusion he brought clarity our problem is is we don't study enough to make it clarity all right let's go to number three six full purpose we're gonna we've read these before we're gonna read them again seventy weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose what is the purpose is to restore Israel and the city everything to do with this is all Redemption it's all restoring everything back to fellowship with God like I said before parallel yourself while we're going through this while we're going through the six fold purpose did he not finish your transgression did he not end your sin did he not reconcile you back to God we're going to read that in just a little while and as bride he brings in everlasting righteousness listen our soul is at peace with God it's in another dimension it doesn't hurt or have problems your soul was God seal up the vision and prophecy inside of you and anoint hope Wow North the whole person amen whose people was it determined upon Daniel's people the Jews what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon the holy city I'm telling you that's a key if you'll see both of those you'll see what brother Brown was talking about where everybody thinks he's wrong and these first few quotes but we're not gonna get to them now because we know for one thing's for sure I'm not here to prove brother I'm wrong you can't that make you God called the Prophet died National Bible God a man so he ain't gotta answer to me but I'm telling you the people think he's wrong so it got to be the devil cuz thank God all right man the proofs in the Word of God though the final proof is in the Word of God all right because remember brother Brown didn't point us to his self he pointed us to what Christ and Christ is the word amen so let's go to number four six full purpose we'll get started here just a second he says I'm leaving out weeks of teaching what kind of hitting is when the weather cools later we get into the seals vials trumpets and all these things that I can remember refer back to you do you remember on the seventy weeks of Daniel do remember the church ages when it went up and what taking place and the seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church look right here the going up of the church this is the Gentile Church ages right Revelation is for one we go up in a wrapped room we don't come back to revelations 19 in the Millennium so that that week right here is not to us at all except it explains Redemption all right it explains my Redemption property' God said six seals finishes our Redemption because there's no redemption in the seventh seal the seven seals Christ himself and there so the same thing is going to happen here who's going to show up right here when this happens Christ is gonna show up but he's not gonna be alone he's gonna have a bride actually they're not gonna have a bride's wife because she's made herself ready alright so in these seventy of we that weeks of Daniel covers from the going up for the church until the coming back of the church that space is what it covers now not all seventy weeks of Daniel part of us we understand there's got to be a rebuilding of the temple there's got to be a messiah come but we're going to stay with the six fold purpose and it happens in this last week of the 70 weeks of Daniel we're kind of going at it backwards but if you'll understand that week you won't have to worry about the other because it'll all be really clear okay seventy weeks are determined paragraph 36 now there's a six fold purpose to his visit telling him what's going to come to pass now there was a six full purpose of his coming there's a six full purpose and then Christ shows up there's a six fold there's a sixth seal redemption and then what Christ shows up everybody got that same n all right come on say what God and it just goes and go right Louise that's pretty cute and 70 weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that is all the journey of the Israel's have on this earth they are determined seventy weeks is just determined that's all that's lighted to the Jews upon thy people and upon thy holy city therefore this seventy weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews also to the end of Jerusalem until they've been you city built because remember this is the Battle of Armageddon everything is going to be destroyed and there's a new city to be built now this is not the future home this is the Millennial temple it is temporary the future home is not temporary the future huh and listen this is the Jews house that's not our house our house is coming a thousand years from then amen but it's a future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride but there'll be a new city built I hope I hope we get into it real deep so let's go down to revelations now this is how it's going to happen revelations 11:1 and there was given to me a reed like a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and then that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not where's given unto the Gentiles in the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty two months how much is forty two months three and a half years okay twelve months three times twelve thirty six and then add six you got you answer alright forty and two months and I will give power until my two witnesses and the two witnesses they show up after we leave and then they show up after we leave because they have nothing to do with the Gentiles nothing they are Jewish people so they'll only receive that they'll only receive their own people the two prophets have nothing to do with the Gentiles they're not Gentiles they are Jews all right anointed with the spirit of Elijah and Moses we know that and I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days that's where I gotta right here twelve hundred and sixty days everybody got that say ma'am twelve hundred and sixty days they will prophesy and then something's going to happen and I'm going to stop right there just for a second because remember when we come to right here when they finish the transgression make an end of sin and reconcile their iniquity they're born again I was telling the church down start of the people downstairs listen they're not there commission is not to preach the statue of a perfect man their commission is not to preach the seals and all these different things that you're born again because they're gonna die and the only got three and a half years and they're gonna be killed for what they believe they don't have time to go up the statue of a perfect man they just they see just like you did when you went through baby form justification baby form sanctification and when God birthed you he birthed you because you had a revelation that Christ died for you on a cross what do you think is gonna happen to them we're gonna read it right here they gonna say where'd you get the scars they say they said in the house of my friends yeah men that okay y'all having a hard time staying awake today is if this bores you you need a new birth you need a new birth y'all sit and watch television all day long just like it somebody start preaching the Word of God to you and you fall asleep you don't even you don't even try to stay awake pinch yourself you know what to do if I get sleepy I'm set on the edge of the bench cuz I know if I fall asleep I'm gonna fall out and make a fiddle on myself try sit right up on the edge of the bench and I have like to fail a few times because we are human but look we're gonna talk about justification sanctification in the baptism of Holy Ghost today if that's all right call this part of the six fold purpose but we got to get the people redeemed first you and I have to come to Redemption first they come to Redemption and then the earth comes to come to a Redemption because when Adam fell in the garden everything fell even the earth everything under us fell so Adam the second Adam comes to redeemed then he brings a bride gets a group out of seven Church ages takes us away to a wedding supper then he comes back and he gets this 144,000 in that 1260 days they preach Redemption all right let's go to number one then to finish the transgression transgression means as recognized by sinners but is as God forgives same way with you you ice telling limit brother Tim hymns listen you've got to have a revelation if I go a little bit long sorry revelation you got to have a revelation that you were justified because you can't just walk up and say well I was a whatever you wanna say I was a drunk well God saved me and then you go back to drinking now you do maybe for a little while but a year later two years later no when you come to a revelation of justification you know for a fact and I know now the devil doesn't but I know my sins were chopped off because God took me on farther and he's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel that was very unclean when he first started the journey with me but he knew that remember brother Browns talks about the glass you picked he said God picks the glass up out of the mud so he had a purpose for that jar even though it's nasty in you and you you wouldn't want to touch it thank God for grace thank God for grace because you can see something on the side of the road and you're like ain't picking that up but God reaches over there and he gets in he fixes up he says hey I'm gonna use this cuz I sold boy right here I'm gonna clean him up well that's what he did with them because man it's across we're gonna read it they just don't even believe Jesus Christ was anything but maybe just a good man not the Messiah definitely not Jehovah in flesh neither did you so what's the difference neither did you so he's going to finish Israel's transgression in this 1260 days the two prophets are going to preach Christ died for your sins and they're going to preach him so real but what they're gonna have attached to it is is they're going to have some signs and wonders to go with it that only Israel is going to be able to accept because all the other world's gonna hate them maybe we read that we're reading it the whole world hates them two prophets but at the 144,000 don't because that's their salvation coming through two men God in human flesh again so as God forgives a nice read where brother where I'm setting the six fold purpose number five now if we get back there's Daniel again we'll find out that in Daniel we find out here the 24th verse to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is transgression it is to go against something a transgression against me is to go wrong to me they done they transgressed God they turned him totally down and it wasn't justice it wasn't just the prostitutes and the drunks they loved him but the religious people of the world hated him same as today transgress against you is to do a wrong to you so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression will be turn away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Spirit we went to Romans 11 just for a second you don't have to do that Romans 11 verse 21 through 27 talks about what the engrafting is said that we were they were the tame olive tree but God had to cut some branches off of the tame olive tree and he grafted in a wild olive tree or seven church ages which is me and you we're the wild child but God loves us he's gonna make a bride out of us but what happens is is then you look in the Romans and it says what more is it though that God can graph them back in again God we lived off the life we live off the life of the Old Testament there are example right then we live through the New Testament then God's going to come back and graph back in that same tame olive tree to make it grow back up again what about Redemption how about that which is truly justification God's going to what finish their sin he's going to finish it and he's going to make an end of sin number two let's do it real quick six full purpose number two make an end of sin now let's read again Daniel to finish transgression I make an end of sin you see all these words finish in and reconcile God and that's the same way done with you because if you have any sin in your soul you're not born again God has done away with the sin in your soul if you're born again he has burned all that out but now you have sin in your middle man memory reasons and conscious effects and imagination remember there's only one sense in the soul in this faith or doubt all right and your skin doesn't sin what's motivates it it's the sinning part alright so make an end of sin number two where did is real sin where did they do their vital sin where did they separate themselves from now we read that if you pull up Matthew 27 just go to the very end of verse 25 then I hope y'all are Bible readers and you know where this come from because Pilate was trying to say look this man there's no fault in this man he's not worthy to die and what did they say he washed his hands and he said do with him in other words see you to it then answered all the people now who were they they were all Jews they were all Jews they looked at him and said his blood be on us and on our children his blood be on us and our children all through this he cut them off and through six church seven Church ages he didn't deal with Israel any more because they said let his blood be on us and our children and there like I said before I see it now in a different light that's the only way they could have said it because his blood didn't cover them during that time he's literally blind in his own children but by his shed blood at Calvary he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do so he forgave them at Calvary but it's gonna you know what they're going to do those two prophets are going to tell them exactly what that man said on the cross and they're gonna believe it in 144,000 Zechariah verse 13 verse 1 and that day day that she'll be a fountain open to the house of David until the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness because remember that's in this 70th week it's not back here now listen God's not dealing with Israel right now no he's dealing with his Gentiles he's guys get us out of the way cuz remember he doesn't deal with two it's the same time he's got to get us out of the way so he can come and deal with them but when he deals with him he's gonna deal with him in the same way you and I come to be Christians because they're gonna be Christian they're gonna be christ-like okay they're just not gonna be bribed because he's already putting them away Zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say unto Him what what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those which I was wounded in the house of my friends those two prophets are gonna preach Jesus Christ so real so they're going to know that those nail prints were for them and they're gonna say where did you get those wounds and he says in the house of my friends all right let's go to number seven the six fold purpose they'll be so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see can't you remember that day weren't you ashamed of yourself I was ashamed of myself when I come to realization that God had forgiven me of my sin when he had what when he had justified me and and made me and started cleaning me up it didn't make me feel real happy I was a little bit sad but I was happy but I was going man he did all that for me amen they'll be so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see that that very one that they crucified in the night standing there their own precious Joseph they'll be such morning they'll say where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends see what I mean to make an end of sin of unbelief because they are stuck in unbelief right now they do not believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins or they would become Christians and 140 this is this this is 144,000 can't receive that if they did they'd be bribed while we're still here but that's why we got to be out of the way totally out of the way Joseph sent his wife to the palace before he revealed itself to his brothers who were the Jews see what I mean make an end of sin of unbelief that's what he's coming for in this 70th year of Daniel he corrects itself 70th week rather coming to make an end of sin put it away you understand now what's the first finish the transgression number two make an end of sin number three make reconciliation but what sanctifies you the blood the blood sanctifies you Jesus Christ blood on the earth sanctified you the man and the blood keeps you sanctified remember the blood doesn't save you keeps you safe that same way with him so that's why when they said let his blood be on us to me that was God speaking through them you say oh that was horrible no that was covering them let his blood be on us for 2,000 years don't you can't he can't destroy Israel but look how they were persecuted Lord Titus killed them some but still they they stayed in that city Salonga they eat their own children they eat the bark off the tree just cuz they turned their Messiah down but that's why one glorious day there's going to be in this in this last day at this time right here the two prophets are here you talk about a 144,000 they gonna have a Pentecostal meeting they ain't gonna be sitting here dry died and no no it's gonna be that fresh day like when you got born again it's gonna be that day when you first started your Christian journey and that everything was real fresh all right so let's go to number three to make reconciliation for iniquity in the Hebrew lexicon that means to cover purged or make an atonement make reconciliation cover over with pitch to make an atonement for you know what Christ did for you he made an atonement look at number eight to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliations but it will not be applied to them see it wasn't applied back 2,000 years ago it's only gonna be applied to the two prophets 144,000 but it will not be applied to them it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it but God kept them covered number nine now Jesus quoted that scripture smite the Shepherd and scared of the sheep but notice the next paragraph he just quoted that much of it but watch what the next sentence of it says I didn't read a minute ago but here he's reading it the next part of it now will turn my hand to the little ones what the Benjamin group that's coming up now I will turn my hand to the little ones smite the Shepherd Israel first Israel smote the Shepherd Jesus scattered the Sheep to all the world what happened Israel has been dispersed all over the world until just recently then there started kind of what made brother Brown so happy he saw them coming back so God could deal with them in their homeland they got to be in the homeland before them two prophets show up scattered the Sheep to all the world but God said I will turn my hand back to get them little ones that the last day when when reconciliation for iniquity has been made Israel will be saved every one of them now made the point last week that's not everybody that says they're Jews that's the only 144,000 heads of household you what do you ever you won't call that's only 144,000 is going to be saved that's according to what the Bible says then he said let's turn to Isaiah 66 chapter read just for a few minutes what God says about Israel being saved let's just read the red part who has heard such a thing who has seen such a thing shall the earth be made and bring forth in one day for as soon as I'm travail she brought forth her children as soon as I saw that their Messiah she was born again in one day make reconciliation for sin make reconciliation for iniquity uncleanness oh my they did that what was evil that which was wrong reconciliation was made for their iniquity alright now look you and I have a reconciliation 2nd Corinthians 5 verse 17 says therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the Ministry of reconciliation alright to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and committed unto us the word of reconciliation he's committed it to me and you the word of reconciliation are the atonement bring up the next one or the new bird they're gonna receive a birth they're going to be born again in the day they're gonna be born again after during this 1260 day period that's going to redeem the Jews but now we've still got a city and we've still got a world that we got to deal with so and that's what I want to go through right here and we can read zechariah 12 if you want to but remember you would pour out upon the house of David inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for me as one mourning for his own son don't you think the 144,000 those they get a revelation of Jesus Christ like I said they're gonna be happy but they're gonna mourn because they the one they realize they're the ones that put him on the cross there the end that what what you know what we realize cuz I didn't physically put him on the cross I didn't physically put him on the cross I didn't physically put him on the cross but I put him on the cross they put him on the cross and they said let his blood be on nursing our children and so did you he said no I didn't well you lived in sin for a while then you okay but his blood kept you covered thank God I stuns people the ones downstairs brother brother said God gives us an angel and that angel is given to predict protect the heirs of righteousness what he knows whose predestinate and who's not he knows you got an we know we've got an angel somewhere watching over us so let's go now and see that these three process is complete the birth now what I want to say tell you is this key to the six fold purpose is that number one the seventy weeks of Daniel according to Daniel nine cannot end right here I said according to the Bible because he shall confirm the covenant with many for what one week one week equals seven years so there's a seven one more 7 year period left after we leave according to the Bible now 99% of the people in the church says no there's only three and a half years to complete Daniel seventy weeks that's not true that's not true according the Bible he said I got quotes if that quote doesn't match the Bible the quotes wrong either later we got to change the Bible you can't change the Bible but I'm telling you brother Bryan knew what he was saying God knew what he was saying through that prophet because I think he stood there one day and I believe it he never said it but I think Jesus said it one time he said thank you Father but you've hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent I mean Jesus yet pull it out of the Bible Jesus said you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood well today we're gonna have to do that but we got a revelation to know that it's not human flesh and it's not human blood but now the quote says the quote says eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and don't know what to quote says you know what's quote says alright that's what the quote says we're gonna have to do what quote says are we going to do what the revelation of the quote says alright so the revelation of this quote is that there's no way that Daniel 7 new weeks can end after the 1260 days of the two prophets according to Daniel 9:24 that says seventy weeks are determined upon thy people in the holy city to do six things we just covered three all right because the Bible says that there that he will confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he'll cut it off and there'll be all kinds of desolations and everything determined that's what the Bible says so let's read revelations 11 let's look at this real quick there was given me a reed and like a rod the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without leave measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles in the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months everybody got that forty in two months and I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1233 scored days which is forty two months according to the to the prophetic calendar not the calendar we live by now clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of the prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will now stop right there because we're going to go back read Daniel 9:27 because revelations 11 1 through 6 is right here they're going to prophesy 1260 days right read your Bible they're gonna prophesy 1260 days then something's gonna happen so let's read Daniel 9:27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now that's a whole seven years and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease right here and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate now let's go back read revelations 11 continue with verse 7 because verse 7 is and when they shall have finished their testimony now we're on your where on your paper has he finished that when the two prophets finished their testimony after 1260 days okay never got that say man that's what the Bible says and then when they shall have finished their testimony the beast in other words the guy that made the covenant with them right here we're not here when it's signed we're not here when it's made so we're going in a rapture he makes a covenant for seven years he breaks that covenant when those 1260 days are over according to the Bible he comes in and breaks the covenant and the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so it's got to be after the 1260 days because the Bible said they're gonna prophesy 1260 days that Alright say Amen and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where they our Lord was crucified and they have the people in kindred and tongue and nations shall see their dead bodies according to seeing the end Fox News and all the other news stations amen cuz they're gonna see their dead body the whole world is only when television is here three days and a half and she'll not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry boy they made some people mad didn't he and make merry and shall send gifts one to the other because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them now look that's not right here right that's in the midst of the week they're gonna take a rapture hello they're gonna take a rapture right here it's what it says right here in the Bible everybody got that in the same hour there was a great earthquake in the tenth part of the city failed verse 13 and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and a remnant were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven that's in the midst of the week then what's going to happen there's going to be a battle of Armageddon I'll pull some quotes up and I'll bring them the next Sunday or Wednesday night maybe we'll do it talking about the Balam Armageddon because the Battle of Armageddon is different from the Battle of Gog and Magog the battle Armageddon is totally different from the Battle of Gog and Magog totally different alright but there's a Bala marm again that destroys by nuclear explosion and all these other things of man cuz that's going to be a man battle right here it's not gonna be God now God's gonna fight for Israel cuz we're gonna read it right here watch go to Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time Michael stand up shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of the people there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book so write in there somewhere they're gonna take a rapture though and then you know what's going to happen there's not one person on this earth a Christian not one person on this earth has the Holy Ghost in their soul not one person not one there's only 144 and two right here 144,000 - there's gonna be zero that's why the Battle of Armageddon they're just gonna start firing at each other because there's nothing left there's no grace of God we're looking at the Great Tribulation there's gonna be tribulation right here I got some quotes I'll read it to you where the where the tribulation starts this way and works its way to Israel then they have that's Jacob's trouble and then because they've been on your chart brother Brent put the Great Tribulation this is tribulation but this is going to be where there is nobody here there's no grace all the grace is gone everything's lifted off the earth and that's just going to be what Gentile men Jewish men without any godliness at all are gonna start destroying each other all right there by okay with that but then it's out to save time let's go to verse 7 Daniels having this vision and I've heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the water of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven swear by him that liveth for ever the bishop for a time times and a half now watch time 1 once time two once a half three and a half years when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people people all these things shall be finished and I heard but I understood not then Daniel said oh my lord what she'll be the end of these things he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed and sealed till the time of the end well you know what they're open now he was talking about us it's open to us because the Prophet came and opened the book for us God through the Prophet go that way Daniel meaning she'll be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wicked and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so now let's start right here just real quick go that was truly a Battle of Armageddon everything's dead and to prove by the Bible that there's one week left after the rapture you can read it in black and white but just to make sure you understand it you can't bring in everything you got to have six things to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel that's what the Bible says seventy weeks are determined to do six things well now we've already had a battle of Armageddon the world's been wiped off there's got to be some time left to do these other three because you can't bring in everlasting righteousness and build a Millennial temple here and then have it all destroyed so there's not three and a half years left of Daniel 70 weeks after the rapture of the church now there is three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left but you gotta bring the city in member it's to Daniel people and the city because the Millennial temples got to be built because in Revelations 1921 we enter into it according to the Bible according to the prophets message I read it to you last Sunday we read it again now so let's go to revelations no let's go to number four number four bring in everlasting righteousness they've already got it up there number four to bring in everlasting righteousness that's the fourth thing to come for the fourth what's he coming to do to bring in everlasting righteousness he makes an industry in reconciliation and to bring in everlasting righteousness when Israel's transgression has come to an end whereas Israel's transgression come to an end right here no it's right here Israel the people right because remember look a city can't transgress it's the people in the city but according to Daniel that's got to build the people back up and the city back up a physical city alright so now watch now we're going I want you to catch this because when we bring that woman and the Dragon cast out you're going to come right back to this same scripture be sure to put it down down then read when Israel's transgression has come to an end Satan who's their accuser an hour accuser Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit when what when bringing in everlasting righteousness something that cannot in all because unrighteousness will be done away with it already has for the people they're already gone but they gotta somewheres got to come back to bring in everlasting righteousness Satan can't be running around during this time he's sealed in the bottomless pit revelations 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive that he should deceive the nation's No More till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season ibaka 2 verse 12 says woe to them that build if the town was blood and stablished a city by iniquity remember this city is not going to be built by blood and by an iniquity the this new city this new temple that's going to be in this millennium is going to be built by 144,000 Jews that are born again we're not building a temple no me and Jim been made forty years I can remember our wedding night oh you can but the next morning we didn't get up build a house no maybe later on but not for a honeymoon and that's what we're on a honeymoon we're gonna build houses we don't eat listen we don't even know how to build a temple we don't need one they need one we don't we are the temple of God they have to have a temple because the Bible says they did woe to them that build up the town with blood and stablished the city by iniquity behold it is not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire and the people shall worry themselves for very vanity but the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea that's going to happen when we come to this bringing in everlasting righteousness oh my next quote whoa in other words number 10 when the enemy has been put away the end of sin has come the bringing in of everlasting righteousness has come Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea amen glory to god it's coming brother it's coming women will be ladies and men will be gentlemen amen when the dollars of the lordship fill the earth to see in the sky all my heart is groaning crying for that day of sweet release when our Jesus shall come back to earth again all right now the millenniums in his own when the city is to be built forth he's dumb about number four so when the city is to be built so you can't put these over here and have a city built and then destroy it you got a thing called the Battle of Armageddon standing in your face all right I hope you get that all right everybody okay all of you that are awake oh okay one's your sleep didn't hear what I said number five seal up the vision and prophecy number eleven what is it oh hallelujah do you see it class this revelation of Jesus crossing of his power and his coming of the end time was sealed up until this time that's what he comes to do is hit from the scholars no wonder they want to apply sealing it back yonder to those prophets and everything way back it won't hold water but this vision has been sealed too right now here now and there's where I'm placing my faith that God will reveal them seventy weeks and then seal it up till the end time close up the words and seal the book until the end time what did he do to seal up the vision and prophecy Daniel had prophesied these things he had saw it in a vision and the angel came down to seal the vision and seal the prophecy they can read it but they can't understand it until the end time and I wrote myself a note know where you're staying and that's what it is you'll know where you stand when you come to this seal up words he sealed up now and you he sealed up in you the world don't know you no more you don't know the world anymore but here what you say well what's that got to do with the look there's something sealed up in this group of people right here that we don't know anything about that's Ezekiel 40 through 44 you and I are not required to know Ezekiel 42 44 read Ezekiel 42 44 it gives you exact dimensions but they know what it's talking about and it's sealed up until they come back and build that temple and they keep building over here they got to build it over here in that last week 1260 days here you got 1260 days here pretty simple to me you'll know where you stand but now look at number six number six is the great one because no man listen no man people have probed at all these different things but it took a prophet to tell us what that said because it says to what to anoint the most holy look at number 12 now to anoint the most holy then this may it be a little bit strange for just a minute too many of you teachers but I just hold on just a minute let's see how it comes out this is the anointing not of a man Jesus is already anointed there right the book of I said that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and went around doing good and healing the sick and so forth let me interject something here you were already anointed you're already anointed you're anointed for the message of your age and is that anointing gonna come off of you know oh it's gonna stay on you the book of Acts says Jesus was anointed with holy ghost went around doing good healing and so forth Jesus is already he is Messiah and Messiah means The Anointed One now this says in North among Seoul is that right be here at the time he's to anoint but here at the end time he's to anoint the most holy now look when he talks about end time your and my brain goes right back to right here that's not the end time right that's the consummation that's the end time where there's nothing go live on the earth but true morning in Holy Ghost fill people amen amen so the end time to me is right here because when that earth gets cleaned off and this new temple comes like we'll read it next but probably Wednesday night about what brother Brian talks about the millennium that millennium sets in time that's a thousand years of just total rest and relaxation for you and I and for the Jews amen but there's going to be a temple built folks and it we're not gonna build it you know mama did help daddy build on what houses he built that was his bride that was natural but God's not gonna require us to build houses amen in the future home yeah thank you lord daddy's built three or four in the future home you know what it's already built you built it he built it to your specifications amen so this is the anointing not of a man Jesus is already he is Messiah you know what brother Graham is doing he's saying okay if this isn't north the most holy he said take Jesus out of your mind cuz he's already anointed you see what he's doing he's pulling it apart so there can only be one answer at the end of this thing because remember the tiber not he said oh that's the tavern I know Tabernacle was anointed back in in Moses this time and Solomon's time I mean and it never was unordered again watch I'll read it right here Messiah means The Anointed One is that right but here at the end time he's true anoint the most holy what is the most holy to my way of seeing in which I believe I can prove by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the tabernacle that'll be used during the Millennium that's right here not right here that's right here all right now listen and see when I get it described in Ezekiel the fourth chapter no I mean the 43rd chapter 1st through 6th verse then he goes back to Ezekiel and talks about the Millennium a little bit here now and see what's going to do in the Millennium anointing then he keeps going if you want to read it yourself save time afterwards he said paragraph 119 now watch description of the temple that is to be built in the Millennium now anyone any reader that knows that from Ezekiel the fortieth chapter until the 44th chapter there's nothing but in the world but the Millennial temple being erected this one doesn't come down out of heaven and just sits on the earth they built this thing you say what are they gonna build it with none of my business I'm bride remember bride don't build it we just come down and enjoy they've already bailed I'm telling this is the Bible nothing the world but the Millennial temple being erected on earth anyone knows that see when the glory of the Lord fills it and so forth like that now we're going to just describe the temple in the 43rd chapter 1st through 6th verse so let's read it afterwards he brought me to the gate even the gate that looking toward the east in it funny the eastern gate where's Christ gonna come through the eastern gate but he's not gonna be by himself and behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like as the noise of many water so it went just one person what is waters people right noise of many waters in the earth shined with his glory and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to the vision I saw when I came when I came to destroy the city and the visions were like the visions that I saw by the river Chebar and I fell on my face and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house that's what brother bran was talking about now let's go to 2nd chronicles chronicles watch it came even to pass that the trumpet ears and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising thanking God Lord then they lifted up their voice with the trumpet and cymbals and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy and do it forever then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to Minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God what's brother I'm telling us now he sent out the North the most holy it's not Jesus he's already anointed this temple he's already been anointed so we're gonna move it out of the way so what's gonna be anointed there's only one thing left me and you God came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over are you going to go to the next one number 13 mmm God came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not thy holy place but to anoint the most holy place and we noticed that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that sends from God out of heaven now watch he's using this what he comes forward and you say well that's got to be the future home but watch prepared as a bride adorned for her husband the anointing will be upon them he's telling us about revelations what is it 22 over the but watch now he comes back though now when zerubabbel dedicated his temple after it was rebuilt it was not anointed again because it was already been anointed and been tore down or it was just instructed again the destruction had it come to it it had been instructed again and put up so there was no anointing of it anymore when it was one time anointed that carried on through and it goes on till this very time but when God sets up the Millennial temple he will anoint the most holy not the holy but the most holy but when the King takes his throne for 1,000 years remember is he's not gonna be alone there's going to be a queen there and then there's going to be a queen there Gloria she's over now the anointing of the most-holy will be the last thing take place when the tabernacle is erected the resurrection has come the Jews has returned Christ and his bride has come the Jews 144,000 are sealed the Millennium has taken place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holy holiest of Holies and the most holy when the most holy place is a sanctuary where God lived between the cherubims this time Christ will sit in the most holy place with the anointing upon him now he gonna be by itself crosses never myself anymore he's got a bride and they don't need no son for the lamb in the midst of the city shall be the light the Sun will never go down in that city is Uncle Jim used to say and it never will because Christ will be that light The Anointed One and the king will come and take his throne for 1000 years let's read the next one now after this the bride appears after the 70 weeks after the 70 weeks the bride appears in revelations 19 chapter 1 and 16 she arrives with her bridegroom the mighty king oh my I don't know whether you're gonna get it all or not just get so let's just read part of this anyway here's what the bride will come after this after the Millennium sets in because remember we can't come back anywhere in this time because this is to Daniel's people and the city we come back after revelations 1921 we come riding into the Millennium alright everybody got that after the Millennium sets in then Christ comes back with the bride now remember he's reading revelations 19 I want to go down to him keep going scrolling down cuz I don't want to read all that save time I was gonna cut it out oh whoa right there and I heard it was a voice of a great multitude listen here you are Church after she went up in the third chapter here she comes as she taught who's he talking about us and I and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and the voice of a mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth hallelujah watch the marriage of the lamb has come here she comes let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready his life has made herself ready here she comes both bride and bridegroom to save time y'all can read the rest of it go down to paragraph 134 what was it his people had just crowned him king of King and Lord of lords coming back to his holy temple anointed with the presence of God to live and reign through the Millennium with his church amen the appearing of the mighty King to take her place at his side the new royal anointed temple now the six full purpose of Revelation six one to revelations nineteen twenty one is fulfilled when when we ride back here not here not here right here and it's right when that 70th week ends we come riding back in right here into the Millennium for a thousand years of just sheer joy we don't have nothing to worry about what are we gonna do brother wait what are we gonna eat doesn't matter just make sure you get there if you're born again today free ride free ride all the way to there at least I know it's more than that but at least at least we can say well this is the marker we're gonna come back right here the Bible says I'm gonna come riding back with my lover my Jesus Christ that I've been on a three and a half year marriage suffer wedding supper been up here doing whatever doesn't make any difference we come right down in here in Revelations 19 21 because the wife had made herself ready though back here and then we're just going to fulfill that right here but we're not going to come back in here to fulfill anything there's no scripture for the bride for this thousand years we're just going to enjoy it now it is for the Jews they got a temp of the building they got all these things where son of David is going to rule and reign the twelve tribes of Israel that's not us but we're gonna be right there with him king and queen sitting on the throne for a thousand years of peace it's real quick finish the transgression make an understand reconciliation for iniquity then we're going to what bring an everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy of these 144,000 are going to come back according to Ezekiel 40 build the temple and then the anointing to the temple according to what brother Branham just said is not Jesus he's already anointed it's not the temple it's already anointed but there's an extra person gonna come back into this one that's being you that's me and you riding back in Revelations 1921 to sit with him and we're going to walk right into that temple and you know what not only Jesus Christ is gonna shine no you're gonna be shining - you're the shining light today aren't you then you're gonna be the shining light of that temple you ain't kidding what a mighty God we serve you're right sister but now we'll start Wednesday we'll talk about the Battle of Armageddon and maybe a little bit about the millennium then we're gonna back up and go all the way back to Daniel 70 we've but remembering we're going in Revelations 401 and don't come back to 1921 so all these things is going to happen it's going to be a Jewish happening doesn't matter you say well what about it we come in biting it listen just for a second brother Branham says we have a wedding supper for three and a half years that is not in the Bible it says we go to the marriage supper of the lamb it didn't say how long but we know we're not going to be here for 1260 days for sure and we may not come back the way over here so it really doesn't matter like I said before we could listen you and I could come off right here a glorified body we could come back right here while they're dropping the bombs in the middle of Israel and it will not hurt us so what are you worried about well what do we got what does it matter well what we gonna get lost during this time and no remember Joseph sent the brides of the palace he come back down introduced itself to his brothers amen introduced itself to his brothers they mourned they said how did you know he said what remember it was seven years they had seven years of good in seven years of drought and he said it was to preserve you what that seven years of good he gave them so much provisions he gave Joseph a dream to put all this store all this food up to last them for seven years of drought it's a part of the drought that's coming amen so everybody got that say man so that's the six fold purpose that's the whole purpose the nine you said many weeks if you don't get anything else forget about days and times but we'll get into that but one week equals seven years he shall what confirms them coming up with many for one week and we will not be here when that covenant is signed so that whole week is for them the seven years and then we ride back into here right with our bride I'm our bridegroom the bride and brought them together now I want to cover something just for about 10 minutes somebody asked a question online about and we usually don't answer these but I think this one can be answered and you're gonna have to you gonna have to run it through your filter the question was I have said it and brother Dale said it many times and even brother branham because they got quotes here and they're gonna pull them up number one the question was is where are the seven churches in the Old Testament brother Branham says and I'm gonna read around here that there's seven churches listen that's what the count of states come from the camel states for in the Old Testament alright so kick yourself for a minute and pinch yourself for a minute and let's go through this the question was is where are the seven churches in the Old Testament now listen I don't think you can put them exactly that Paul taught this one I rainiest out this one persons but there are things that happen remember who was the pattern messenger for all seven church ages Paul Paul was the pattern messenger for all seven Church ages brother Branham took them all back to Paul right cuz remember he tried Polycarp that one time and Polycarp leaned a little more toward organization so he chose Irina's who stood against that like Paul did all right so let's read this right here so the question that the brother had was where are the seven churches in the Old Testament alright let's read these quotes and then I'm going to make up a couple comments and then we'll take communion that all right if you've got an ailment god heal you in the next ten minutes alright in the Old Testament if the Lord allows willing maybe in the coming service I'd like to show how that the seven church ages typed out now see it typed out in the Old Testament what an exact like the seals topped the church ages but not exact remember because the first the first three ages top the first seal right second seal third seal for seal because the rapture takes place in the fourth seal so they say it's a parallel hi not an exact this person in that person so this is you know this is for the brother online how that they began just exactly like at the beginning of the church ages of the Gentile church and went right down through a similar Dark Age and came out into the glorious time of Pentecost at the falling of the Holy Spirit in the early church in the Jewish dispensation now remember the church ages or a Gentile dispensation but they parallel themself alright then going through another period of the Gentile church through a Dark Age and then coming out again into the millennium at the end alright let's read number two the prophet Elijah 1954 our text tonight deals with an Old Testament character and that is the prophet Elijah and then the time of our reading was a very dark hour in Israel that was a time that a great King Ahab right in the Dark Ages if I got that same n right in the dark ages so right here if you take this is Israel here and we're going to do now in our seven church ages what was the Dark Age it was this one right here right the fourth church age the fourth church age was the Dark Age will happen church and state married each other so what happened during the dark ages of the Old Testament church ages they have and Jezebel married right right here Watch right in the dark ages I would say of Israel they came to a seizure of precision just like the Christian Church has so if our church ages like that then there's was like the same one there's your middle church age all right not talking so much of messengers but watch how this parallels and I believe about the darkest day of Israel was when they have was raining and they have been married Jezebel and brought our dolla tree into the Jewish Church she brought in her pagan gods and that was duplicated to the Gentiles during the Dark Ages when the church married into pagan again and brought our dollar tree into the church also so everybody we would week with let's just let's just say now that the Dark Age of the Old Testament the the fourth say the fourth church age is right there that's a happened Jezebel nobody got that saying man now we gotta find the one beginning and to find the one at the end to watch number four or number three went up and do number three number three is the water of separation 1955 brother Brown was talking about this in the fifty no that's just speaking of it in the three dispensations we would bring it down through the Old Testament and through the seven church ages for the seven strokes and so forth that looking through the streets of blood there the seven different streaks represented the seven church ages Israel natural and the Gentile Church in spiritual seven Church ages just exactly the same and Israel had seven Church ages right in its bloom of its best came a having man Jesse but American idolatry and brought in idolatry and caused idolatry in Israel that's their Dark Age so there's the same again look we be saying the Christian Church did the same thing out of the Dark Ages come right in and married right into the same thing and brought our Dollar Tree into the Christian Church just exactly perfectly in its middle age everybody got that same an all right number four in Shalom that Sun is the word of God in the beginning God said let there be light and when the manifested Word of God when the Word of God was manifested there was life first God spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he's spoken and then it was manifested vindicated his word was a vindicated light came into existence and that's the only way it can be done now it's when the word is vindicated God's written word vindicated and then it shows light it's a portion it's a portion is lit are put for each age remember I told you about brother man said there's a box each churches had had a manifestation and had an anointing and you couldn't do no more than what was in that box all right try same way Israel was the same way because remember brother mom always says Moses is Noah's message and Moses is message can't be the same and then all right so that's the only way it can be done it's when the word is vindicated God's written word vindicated then it shows like it's a portion is lit or put out for each age we find it in the church ages we find it in the old the Old Testament Church ages each time there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey there was a prophet came to the earth and when the word came to the prophet and he made that word live and when that word was identified it reflected God and there was the the age there was the light that's the way light comes today so it came under what Paul Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah there buddy got that say man all right let's read number five now here's where I think we're going to see at least the beginning and end of the church ages in the old testament smyrna church age you know what how many times you read church days book 25 or 30 40 50 times I ain't never read this quote before this period Amana Christ is not new this is not something that just came in to church ages it has been here all along to get a clearer understanding of how it works how it goes against God and takes over the church look at the Old Testament and see if there let us examine the spirit as it was manifested in our Israel as she came out of Egypt to be the church and the wilderness watch this just as the early church now he's talking about the early church right here just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit book of Acts that's when the church age started right so now we got to figure out when the church age started for the for the Jewish the Old Testament very clear though watch what happens he identifies it right here just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and interpretations wisdom knowledge and healing healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the Spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was leading the people so who was the first church age messenger now listen if Paul was the pattern messenger for the New Testament who in the world pattern the Old Testament Moses so here's your first church age it started when they left Egypt I just read you that quote so Moses hey the whole Old Testament patterns after Moses so they hold New Testament patterns after Paul so to me that's the beginning of the church ages if brother I'm talking about because he's reading it right here look so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the Spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their king he was a father king he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation in which he was truly God he was truly God same way in the church age remember when you become born again in the church age you were carrying you were called out of the world you called out of the world Israel was called out of the world Taiping Egypt being called out of Egypt and being God's people but look but one day they were the only nation in which it was truly God but one day they got to looking around they saw the Philistines and other nations with Kings over them that's the same thing happening right here because they have was the king of Israel oh yeah it started back over here as a D as a saying as a deed it became a doctrine same thing now God was going look watch this right here this is neat they were the only nation they saw the Philistines and other nations were Kings over them it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king what did Constantine do he married church and state together in that fourth Church age now God was going to humanize the leadership himself man just wanted in a head of God God was going to humanize the leadership in the person of the Lord Jesus but they got ahead of him Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God that's exactly what they did right here amen he said okay brother wait where's the ending of the church age all right let me ask you a question in the ending of the Gentile church age who shows up Elijah - what introduced Christ amen who showed up at the end of the Old Testament church a to introduce Christ Elijah number three so the last church age messenger would be John the Baptist he said oh nice a New Testament no he came in the Old Testament - what - introduced Christ so there's your church ages now you say well well I don't know where the other messengers are I just know that Moses started it John the Baptist ended it Paul started the Gentile church age and this part of Elijah that we see now ended it because you know what look John the Baptist introduced Christ then the day of Pentecost come which the day of Pentecost then is right here amen ties them right together that day seven churches in the Old Testament and then what happened seven Church ages started right on the end of the New Testament so there's yo to me that to me I don't have a quote but I got one for Moses but brother Brian said Moses when they came out of Egypt there was your there was your first church beginning to start then it went the same way if you'll look through there and look all the God sent a prophet though at all these different times right I don't know what their names are but he put Isaiah Jeremiah all these different ones he sent prophets same way with here he sent what Paul Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah sent the same thing so for the brother at just from what I see and my understanding that the seven churches in the Old Testament began with Moses the middle Dark Ages will they have and the last church age messenger to the Old Testament was John the Baptist because he introduced Christ you saw no he wasn't in it when did the New Testament begin in the book of Acts not in Matthew not in mark not in Luke not in John they were still under the law now listen they wrote it may be after the book of Acts because they had to have the Holy Ghost erotic but what were they writing they were writing a commentary on when Jesus was on earth because remember the Bible says Christ was born what under the law so the law continued all the way to John but then the law became Paul and rhiness Martin clung all the ones grace the Old Testament there's your seven church ages now where they are I don't know but I know I believe Moses was a pattern messenger for it and John the Baptist is the one that ended it because he introduced Christ just like brother Branham came on earth this Elijah what do you do he came to what introduce Jesus Christ to you and I so let's stand our feet maybe that'll help the brother answer the question you see I'm not the pastor I can answer some questions brother Dale's got a target on his back to leave the path of the Jerrod's but I can I know I really felt he was sincere he wanted to know because we quoted all the time and even brother Branham quotes it likes 9 quotes where he verbatim quotes the Old Testament church ages in the Old Testament so there had to been there had to be 7 for him to say that so I just wanted to kind of see if you understood that that and that's the total continuity of he sent prophets to who reveal Christ them prophets didn't reveal their self all the prophets in the Old Testament didn't come to reveal their self they pointed to Christ all right well okey-dokey listen I got to find it now ones in you got it I've got it written here but here we go all right brother Devils been coughing a little bit so we're gonna do this thing if you want to turn 2 Corinthians Corinthians 11 verse 23 Lord how do you read that not mine mine are bigger than his you know I got my contacts in and I still can't read it what a shame that is all right here we go oh the order of the Lord's the table everybody ready all mines clear we you know we love the Lord we love the Lord that he can give us these things that we can yeah give him a handclaps of praise [Applause] you know we can stand here forever and ever and talk about it but unless God reveals it to you but you know what it's like brother Darrell now we were talking not well not long ago we just got it we're trying to make this so simple it's like you said we're not trying to confuse people if you if you're confused and you don't study how can the Holy Ghost be confused the Holy Ghost can't be confused so either you don't have it are you not feeding him enough one of the two cuz he said he'd lead you and guide you into some truth no he said I'll lead you and guide you into all truth all right so if somebody tells you truth God order to be able to give you an answer and it's a Bible answer not one that we just kind of you know that's why I said about brother Branham he everything he said was scriptural had to be where'd he get it from he had to get it from the Bible because he's a word prophet alright first corinthians verse 11 I mean 11 verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that was all all I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood see that's what did you test them I started when the shed when the blood was shed when the teto when the test testator died that's when the New Testament started right the Old Testament was under bulls and goats blood they didn't take communion but now when the Lamb of God comes he says you got to take of me now because I'm the one that's going to save you those goats and bulls and all that that was fine it covers you but it will not save you and look this won't save you either but it's a symbol that God died for you in human flesh like that like that quote I love that quote where brother Adam said said God was gonna come and humanize himself it's just that man wanted to do it you know before God was gonna do it because he listened Christ was coming on this earth regardless of what was going on all right he's always wanted to live in human flesh always and when he had given thanks he breakings to take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's doing remembers from me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me do we really remember that that night he was getting ready to shed his physical blood and they were gonna rip his body apart before that next morning and that's what we're symbolizing that he went through that and he's giving it to us to partake of it not for taking their physical body no where is body now but in symbol we can take this and say God thank you for doing what you did everything we do should be giving the thanks to God we're as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat a see you can examine yourself you so I had this problem with soldier brother Bram said go ahead and take communion he said but you better get it done he said get it right get it right because right here here is the here's des I say this is the out but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world I had a preacher one time tell me so we don't take communion till all my people think they're ready I said well we would never take it we take it the first Sunday of every month and I you know what I started getting ready lord cleaned me out make me wear these hate this don't don't wait anyway when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord the Lord's one who condemned this enemy will but we should not be content that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home and that you come not together into condemnation and the rest well I said in order when I come let's just have a mole
