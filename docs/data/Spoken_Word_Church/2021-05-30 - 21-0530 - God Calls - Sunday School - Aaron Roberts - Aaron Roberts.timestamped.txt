[0:03] bless y'all this morning
[0:05] good to be in the house of the lord and
[0:09] just bear with me for a minute
[0:12] it's always good to be in the house the
[0:15] lord and
[0:16] good to have some of my family with us
[0:19] this morning
[0:24] it's always good to see each one of you
[0:27] because
[0:28] each one of you is my family also so
[0:31] good to see brother
[0:32] daniel sister debbie this morning i want
[0:34] to speak a
[0:35] little thought about god
[0:38] calling god calls
[0:42] and start with genesis chapter 3
[0:46] beginning of verse 8.
[0:49] and it says and they heard the voice of
[0:50] the lord god walking in the garden in
[0:53] the cool of the day
[0:54] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[0:56] from the presence of the lord god
[0:58] amongst the trees of the garden
[1:00] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:02] said unto him
[1:03] where art thou and he said i heard thy
[1:06] voice in the garden and i was afraid
[1:08] because i was naked
[1:09] and i hid myself you know
[1:13] we never we never go never have look man
[1:16] has never looked for god
[1:18] that man has never sought for god it's
[1:21] always been god looking for man god's
[1:22] always sought
[1:24] there's always salt man
[1:27] and you know john chapter 6 verse 44
[1:32] says no man can come to me except the
[1:34] father which
[1:35] sent me draw him says i will raise him
[1:38] up at the last day
[1:40] so you know we get we don't look for god
[1:42] god looks for us
[1:44] and you know when god starts to cough
[1:46] just like adam
[1:49] we have a real tendency to run from god
[1:52] we don't you know because if people say
[1:54] well i sought god well if you stop god
[1:56] you'd be looking for him
[1:59] but the scripture tells us that it's the
[2:01] goodness of god that leadeth to
[2:03] repentance
[2:04] it's god calling us and it's the
[2:06] goodness of god that calls us
[2:08] ii peter 3 9 says the lord is not slack
[2:10] concerning his promise
[2:12] as some men count slackness but is
[2:14] longsuffering toward us
[2:16] not willing that any should perish but
[2:18] that all
[2:19] should come to repentance so
[2:23] you know we the
[2:28] the world's full of people that are
[2:32] looking they're looking for something
[2:35] and they don't know what they're looking
[2:36] for
[2:37] and many times you go to speak to people
[2:39] and you know they
[2:41] brother i'm talking about people having
[2:43] a thirst
[2:44] having a desire for something they don't
[2:46] know what to fulfill that desire
[2:48] people bounce from one thing to the
[2:50] other and they're all the time trying to
[2:51] find something that's going to
[2:53] satisfy that thirst and they don't know
[2:55] what that thirst
[2:57] what will fulfill that thirst in their
[2:59] life and
[3:00] you know they they go from one they
[3:02] think they'll find something that's
[3:03] going to fulfill that
[3:05] thirst that that desire that's inside of
[3:07] them and they'll
[3:08] some people will chase it with
[3:09] everything that they have
[3:11] when they chase it then after a while it
[3:14] it becomes
[3:15] unfulfilled there's no joy there there's
[3:18] there's no fulfillment in it so they go
[3:20] to something different
[3:21] they look for something else and you
[3:23] know the world they're all the time
[3:24] trying to find
[3:25] stuff and you see people that are you
[3:27] know alcoholics drug addicts you know
[3:29] they
[3:30] they want to find something they want to
[3:31] find the next high they want to find the
[3:33] next fulfillment
[3:35] and they can't find anything and then
[3:37] they go to the next thing and it doesn't
[3:38] fulfill and they go to the next one and
[3:41] you know some people they chase they
[3:43] chase money and
[3:44] and they've they've spent all their time
[3:46] trying to find this fulfillment in money
[3:48] and it's like well you know if i if i
[3:49] make
[3:50] more money than i made last year you
[3:52] know they and then you know
[3:53] they they make more money than they can
[3:55] spend or anybody could spend and you
[3:57] know they don't they don't they're still
[3:58] not fulfilled
[4:00] right you know they talk about napoleon
[4:04] you know napoleon had this great desire
[4:06] to conquer the world and
[4:08] here he was up trying to conquer the
[4:10] whole world and when he conquered the
[4:12] known world and
[4:13] didn't have anybody worth fighting
[4:14] anymore then he was he was depressed
[4:16] because he didn't have nobody else to
[4:18] fight
[4:20] because you know he had reached these
[4:22] goals and he couldn't nothing satisfied
[4:25] but let me tell you something there's
[4:27] nothing in this world like jesus christ
[4:30] there's nothing in this world like him
[4:33] that we can that god calls us
[4:37] many are called but few are chosen but
[4:40] god
[4:40] calls us
[4:44] and what did god call us for god didn't
[4:45] call us just to call us
[4:47] but god called us for a purpose
[4:51] so you know many times in our lives we
[4:53] wonder what that purpose is what god
[4:55] calls us
[4:56] what's that purpose is to fulfill his
[4:58] word
[5:00] god has a god has a purpose for each one
[5:02] of our lives
[5:03] and you know sometimes we we wonder you
[5:06] know
[5:06] if it's if it's how
[5:11] important it is well many times we look
[5:14] at our
[5:14] our lives and and the call that god has
[5:16] placed in our lives
[5:18] what god placed in our lives is
[5:22] does it does doesn't measure up to other
[5:25] people's standards you know because we
[5:27] look
[5:27] we want to look at ourselves through
[5:29] other people's eyes
[5:32] but you know the only person that you
[5:34] and i should try to
[5:37] to uh honor
[5:41] and i don't want to use the word worry
[5:43] but i but but to have such a
[5:45] zeal to fulfill what god wants us to do
[5:48] is you know we sing that song is the
[5:50] lord satisfied with me is
[5:52] is god satisfied with my life does
[5:55] is the honor and glory of the scripture
[5:58] tells us
[5:58] that he called us into this kingdom of
[6:01] honor
[6:02] and virtue is that the same honor
[6:05] that we give to god in our lives not
[6:08] just
[6:08] not just to in the worship of our lips
[6:11] but in our worship and of our lives
[6:14] the h each thing that we do in this
[6:18] world
[6:20] because that's what god wants us to do
[6:22] god wants us to be
[6:24] god called us for a purpose
[6:30] you know this the scripture tells us in
[6:32] luke 19
[6:35] when he's speaking to he's speaking to
[6:37] zacchaeus
[6:39] and zacchaeus he says for the son of man
[6:42] has come to seek and save those
[6:45] which were lost
[6:49] first corinthians 1 9 says god is
[6:52] faithful by whom
[6:53] you were called unto the fellowship of
[6:56] his son
[6:58] jesus christ our lord so we've been
[7:00] called
[7:02] into a fellowship with him
[7:05] and if we've been called into this
[7:07] fellowship then you know god has
[7:10] a a
[7:15] promises and it calls us into
[7:19] um blessings
[7:24] and so if we've been called to these
[7:25] blessings then that was what god you
[7:27] know wants us to have and
[7:28] god wants us to use these things and you
[7:31] know
[7:31] if he said he said that we are heirs of
[7:34] god and join heirs with christ and you
[7:35] know the things that christ has
[7:37] that he wants us to have and he wants
[7:40] that he wants us to
[7:41] be beneficiaries of those things and and
[7:44] to use those things and walk in the
[7:46] liberty
[7:48] the scripture tells us that you know we
[7:50] should walk worthy
[7:52] of the calling that god has given us and
[7:54] you know
[7:55] you know and sometimes you know
[7:59] the devil wants us to have a different
[8:01] view vision of ourselves or a different
[8:03] view of
[8:03] of what we should what we should be but
[8:05] you know god has called us and
[8:07] that's when we look to see what our our
[8:10] vision should be our vision should be
[8:12] what the word says
[8:13] to look into the word and see ourselves
[8:16] see our see ourselves for who we
[8:18] are even even if you have shortcomings
[8:20] you know the thing is is there's a
[8:22] there's a blessing there because you can
[8:23] see where you've fallen short
[8:26] for all have seen to come short of the
[8:28] glory of the lord but the thing is the
[8:30] word gives us the opportunity
[8:32] that we can become right that we can
[8:33] come back into fellowship with him
[8:36] because if if we have if we have a a
[8:39] sin or something there's a way back
[8:42] that we can be right before god that
[8:44] anything that
[8:45] comes before us there's a way god has
[8:47] already made provisions for us
[8:50] that we can come and and all of the
[8:53] issues that we have in life
[8:56] you know many times people well i don't
[8:57] know what i'm going to do
[8:59] well i don't know what i'm going to do
[9:02] well i know what i'm going to do
[9:04] because god given us away god give us a
[9:07] way to
[9:08] call on his name and ask you know
[9:11] because he'll lead and guide us
[9:12] if we'll ask he's already had the answer
[9:15] before we even ask for it
[9:16] but he wants you to ask the scripture
[9:18] said to ask that our joy might be full
[9:21] so we have to ask and god can bring
[9:23] these things to us
[9:29] in acts 2
[9:32] very familiar scripture in acts 2
[9:34] beginning at
[9:36] verse 36 and the scripture tells us
[9:40] when when the disciples came out of the
[9:43] upper room and
[9:44] you know they were staggered around like
[9:47] drunk people and you know people was
[9:49] wondering what
[9:50] what in the world was going on but peter
[9:53] stood up and told him said you know
[9:54] these people aren't drunk as you suppose
[9:57] but he said this is that which was
[9:59] spoken of by the prophet joel
[10:02] you know many people had read the
[10:03] scripture but they had never seen the
[10:05] manifestation of it
[10:08] they had their own idea what the
[10:09] scripture was but they didn't see the
[10:10] manifestation of it
[10:13] but peter says therefore let all the
[10:15] house of israel know assuredly that god
[10:17] hath made that same jesus whom ye have
[10:19] crucified both lord and christ
[10:23] and he said now when they heard this
[10:24] they were picked in the heart
[10:26] and he said unto peter and unto the rest
[10:28] of the disciples men and brethren
[10:30] what shall we do then peter said unto
[10:33] them repent
[10:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[10:36] name of jesus christ for the remission
[10:38] of sins
[10:39] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[10:40] holy ghost for the promise is unto you
[10:43] and to your children
[10:44] and to them that are afar off even as
[10:47] many
[10:48] as the lord our god shall call so when
[10:52] god began to call man god had a plan and
[10:55] a purpose for
[10:56] for man to follow and the scripture says
[11:00] when when the day of pentecost come
[11:02] because that's what it was
[11:03] to be the fulfilling of the scripture
[11:05] was the indwelling of the spirit
[11:07] it was to come back upon man to come
[11:10] back into fellowship
[11:12] true fellowship would with god
[11:15] and he called and he said you know they
[11:16] asked him what should we do he said
[11:18] repent
[11:19] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[11:21] christ
[11:23] very simple prescription that was given
[11:26] but he said
[11:27] but it was a promise and he said this
[11:29] promise is unto you
[11:31] and to your children and to them that
[11:34] are far
[11:35] off even as many as the lord our god
[11:37] shall call
[11:40] and you know i'm glad to proclaim today
[11:42] that god's still calling
[11:44] if he's called one he'll call he'll call
[11:46] he's continuing to call
[11:48] right he said the only thing that we've
[11:50] got to do is we've got to meet
[11:52] the same criteria we've got to come to
[11:54] the same basis have the same faith
[11:56] that those met he said he said if he
[12:00] ever healed one
[12:01] he'll heal him again but you and i have
[12:03] to come on the same basis
[12:04] the first one came on and he said he
[12:07] said if you if you have a need this
[12:09] morning that he's here to meet that need
[12:12] and he said he said if he's called one
[12:14] and he give him the gift of eternal life
[12:17] then you know he's still given that gift
[12:18] of eternal life today
[12:20] and it's unto each one and he said he
[12:22] said it's to you
[12:24] and to your children so you know what
[12:27] as parents we can stand up and proclaim
[12:29] to our children we can claim our
[12:31] children
[12:33] that we can claim them because if he
[12:36] done it for us he'll do it for
[12:38] them he said to them that are far off
[12:40] even as many as the lord our god shall
[12:42] call
[12:43] so if he's ever called one he'll
[12:44] continue to give
[12:46] and he's still calling today
[12:49] the question is is do you and i
[12:53] are those that god calls do they answer
[12:56] that call
[12:57] because god is calling
[13:02] second peter chapter one verse verses 3
[13:05] and 4 says according as his divine power
[13:08] hath given unto us all things that
[13:10] retain
[13:11] unto life and godliness through the
[13:13] knowledge of him that hath
[13:14] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[13:17] are given unto us exceeding great and
[13:19] precious promises
[13:21] that by these ye might be partakers of
[13:23] the divine nature
[13:25] having escaped the corruption that is in
[13:27] the world through lust
[13:30] so god has called us to this and these
[13:32] are the promises that god has made to us
[13:35] that we can receive the divine nature
[13:37] that we can bypass these things
[13:40] god has given us a way
[13:44] to become like him hebrews 9
[13:48] says 14 15 says how much more shall the
[13:51] blood
[13:54] of christ who through the eternal spirit
[13:56] offered himself
[13:57] without spot to god purge your
[13:59] conscience from dead works to serve
[14:02] the living god and for this cause he is
[14:05] the mediator
[14:06] of the new testament that by means of
[14:09] death for the
[14:10] redemption of the transgression that
[14:13] were under the first
[14:14] testament they which are called
[14:17] might receive the promise of eternal
[14:20] inheritance
[14:24] first thessalonians
[14:28] 2 11 to 13
[14:31] says as you know how we exhorted and
[14:34] comfort and charged every one of you as
[14:36] a father doth his children
[14:38] that ye would walk worthy of god who
[14:40] have called you into his kingdom and
[14:42] glory
[14:43] for this cause also thank god we think
[14:46] we god without ceasing because
[14:48] when ye received the word of god which
[14:51] you heard of us
[14:52] you received it not as the word of men
[14:55] but as it is in truth the word of god
[14:59] which effectually worketh also in you
[15:03] that believe so when we've heard the
[15:06] word we must receive the word
[15:09] and the scripture says that we've become
[15:11] the word as we receive the word
[15:15] because the script the word
[15:19] receiving the word we have received that
[15:21] power
[15:22] to become the sons of god
[15:26] because he said he came to his own and
[15:27] his own received him not
[15:30] but as many as believed
[15:33] so if we believe on the word
[15:36] not that it's the words of man
[15:40] you know many people they they want to
[15:41] spend all their time
[15:43] you know trying to dispute this part of
[15:46] this part or whatever
[15:48] but you know what if if we believe what
[15:51] god says
[15:52] if it's the word of god then you know
[15:53] what he'll bring it to pass
[15:55] you put your trust in god and he he'll
[15:57] show you what the truth is because he'll
[15:59] lead you and guide you
[16:02] you know many times brother i'm talking
[16:04] about
[16:05] the different ones and you know sight
[16:07] and time is the biggest hindrance god
[16:09] has
[16:11] and you know the thing is is people
[16:13] people you know they want to
[16:14] some a quick fix or they want to answer
[16:16] right now or whatever but you know
[16:18] you just hold on and wait for god and
[16:20] god will give you the answer
[16:24] you know god's never late god's always
[16:26] on time
[16:30] you know when when jesus come to the
[16:35] tomb of lazarus you know mary and martha
[16:38] there you know
[16:41] and they were so upset that that jesus
[16:43] didn't come on
[16:44] when they called for him
[16:47] but you know he said i'm the
[16:48] resurrection and the life
[16:52] and they were looking for offer some you
[16:54] know off in the future what was going to
[16:55] take place
[16:57] but he was trying to tell them right now
[17:00] is the time
[17:01] i am the resurrection and the life
[17:06] now was the time see they didn't realize
[17:08] this was the time that god had given
[17:10] for the resurrect for him to raise
[17:12] lazarus was right then
[17:14] not something off in the future
[17:17] it's not something off in the future
[17:20] it's right now it's today
[17:21] today's the day of salvation today is
[17:24] the day
[17:26] of your miracle today is the day of of
[17:28] your answer
[17:29] whatever you're you're looking for today
[17:31] is that day
[17:34] so we can just look to god this morning
[17:37] today say lord whatever
[17:40] what am i looking for lord
[17:43] if you have a need open up your heart
[17:46] this morning let god speak to you
[17:50] and he'll give you what you have desire
[17:52] but you know
[17:53] what your desire is this morning
[17:56] we'll have the musicians come this
[17:58] morning
[18:00] i want to read one more scripture before
[18:03] i finish as the musicians are coming
[18:05] romans 8 28 8-31 says
[18:09] for we know that all things work
[18:11] together for good to them that love god
[18:13] to them who are the called according to
[18:15] his purpose
[18:17] for whom he did for no he also did
[18:19] predestinate to be conformed to the
[18:21] image
[18:22] of his son that he might be the
[18:23] firstborn
[18:25] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[18:28] predestinate
[18:29] them he also called and whom he called
[18:31] them he also justified
[18:33] and whom he justified them he also
[18:34] glorified
[18:36] what shall we then say to these things
[18:39] if god before us who can be against us
[18:44] that's what i want to leave you with
