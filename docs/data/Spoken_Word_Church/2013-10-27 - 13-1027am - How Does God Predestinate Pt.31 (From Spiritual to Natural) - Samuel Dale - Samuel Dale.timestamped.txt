[0:04] thankful to the lord to be here again
[0:06] today
[0:09] amen
[0:12] no
[0:13] sometimes we we think and
[0:16] we
[0:17] imagine how things will be
[0:20] our imagination
[0:21] it's good to have
[0:23] but it can be terrible to misuse
[0:26] and uh you know i think her scripture i
[0:29] was going to read i said well i won't i

[0:34] be in the field what brother dale going
[0:35] to
[0:36] preach to read you know i said well
[0:40] the best way to find out
[0:41] instead of imagining what he'd think it
[0:43] just go after him

[0:49] solved with such a little simple matter

[16:09] hearts
[16:10] we committed to you now in jesus name
[16:13] amen
[16:15] romans 8 we've been reading that because
[16:17] we're still
[16:18] talking about how does god predestinate
[16:22] and we're getting now down to life on
[16:26] earth
[16:30] right
[16:33] right
[16:34] okay some of you that are away
[16:37] this coming saturday uh we invite you to
[16:40] come
[16:41] and
[16:42] you know sign up
[16:44] and you can spend the night with
[16:45] somebody saturday night you don't have
[16:47] to drive back home okay but go
[16:50] downstairs and just ride on the sheets
[16:52] you know
[16:53] there need a place to stay
[16:55] and whatever
[16:57] put it on the side where the writing is
[16:59] not there and if you need a place to
[17:01] stay and to some that wants to say we'll
[17:04] take care of somebody write that down
[17:06] and that way we can you know you won't
[17:08] have to drive back home
[17:09] is the point
[17:11] for you know being late getting through
[17:13] all right
[17:14] romans 8 28
[17:17] and we know that all things work
[17:18] together for good to them that love god
[17:21] to them who are the called according to
[17:22] his purpose
[17:23] for whom he did for no he also did
[17:25] predestinate to be conformed
[17:28] to the image of his son that he might be
[17:30] the firstborn among many brethren
[17:32] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[17:35] he also called and whom he called them
[17:37] he also justified
[17:40] in whom he justified what
[17:44] them he also glorified so when god it's
[17:46] all over with we're not over with you
[17:48] right
[17:49] but what do we say to that what shall we
[17:51] then say to these things if god be for
[17:54] us
[17:55] who can be against us it's not over with
[17:58] but we sure don't have to worry about it
[18:00] you know everything's right on time okay
[18:03] we'll go to genesis 4
[18:06] and we'll read about the first 10 verses
[18:08] because this is where our thought will
[18:09] be taken from
[18:11] and adam you eve his wife
[18:16] and she conceived and barking and said i
[18:18] have gotten a man from the lord
[18:20] and see again by his brother abel and
[18:22] abel was a keeper of the sheep became
[18:24] was a tiller of the ground in the
[18:26] process of time it came to pass that
[18:28] cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[18:31] and offering unto the lord
[18:33] and abe lost abel he also brought of the
[18:36] firstlings of his flock
[18:38] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[18:40] respect unto abel
[18:42] and to his offering but in the cane and
[18:44] to his offering he had not respect
[18:47] mccain was very wroth and his
[18:48] countenance failed
[18:50] the lord said unto cain
[18:52] why aren't thy wrath and why is thy
[18:54] countenance fallen
[18:56] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[18:58] accepted
[19:00] and if thou doest not well sin light at
[19:02] the door
[19:03] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[19:05] thy shall rule over him
[19:07] and cain talked with abel his brother
[19:09] and it came to ice when they were in the
[19:11] field that cain rose up
[19:13] against abel his brother and slew him
[19:15] and the lord said unto cain
[19:17] where is abel thy brother and he said i
[19:19] know not i know not am i my brother's
[19:22] keeper and he said
[19:25] what hast thou done
[19:27] the voice of thy brother's blood cried
[19:30] out unto me
[19:31] from the ground amen you may be seated
[19:34] the lord had his blessing to the
[19:36] reading of the word
[19:41] amen
[19:43] now
[19:44] i said we're speaking on predestination
[19:47] or
[19:48] how does god predestinate
[19:50] and we know that he predestinates by
[19:52] foreknowledge
[19:54] all right
[19:55] now
[19:56] foreknowledge
[19:59] is what
[20:00] the ability for god to look down through
[20:04] and see what would happen on earth
[20:08] and then he would predestinate or set
[20:11] the destiny
[20:14] for
[20:15] what would be
[20:17] so we spent quite a time back up in the
[20:19] eternities and we've come down now to
[20:22] get to the earthly situation
[20:26] and we're looking in the garden and
[20:27] seeing what happened
[20:29] and that was why i wanted wade to take
[20:32] this past wednesday because uh
[20:36] you know i wanted to try to get it today
[20:38] where everybody would be here more
[20:40] to understand and especially the newer
[20:42] ones
[20:43] to that we would try today
[20:45] uh this morning this afternoon we're
[20:47] going to be basically dealing with a lot
[20:49] of the scriptures
[20:51] and talking about the things to
[20:54] to try to get a better understanding
[20:57] of the
[20:58] uh you know the situation you say well
[21:01] we understand what happened well that's
[21:03] that's all right
[21:05] uh but we
[21:06] we need a revelation
[21:10] that's what we need more than anything
[21:12] and uh you know in getting everything
[21:14] set in order to where we can understand
[21:17] now
[21:18] but we've we've
[21:20] seen that the
[21:22] fall of man
[21:25] that eve first fell for satan's lie
[21:30] in her
[21:31] second realm of reasoning imaginations
[21:34] etc
[21:36] and it perverted her senses her
[21:38] reasonings and things you know and all
[21:41] got involved
[21:43] and no matter what you call it this is
[21:46] to the people on the internet where they
[21:48] get all jumbled up about the
[21:50] the uh before and after of brother
[21:52] branham and the way he's talking
[21:54] of the like in the early ministry he
[21:56] would say
[21:58] body
[21:58] soul spirit
[22:00] and then in life standing up he would
[22:02] say body spirit and soul
[22:04] but he never changed the essence of what
[22:07] he was talking about so he didn't have
[22:08] to correct it
[22:10] because he always gave the first rim of
[22:12] man which is see tastes filled and
[22:14] smelling here
[22:16] he always gave that as the outside man
[22:18] the second realm of man is memory reason
[22:22] conscience affections etc
[22:24] and he always called that the second rim
[22:27] no matter whether he would call it soul
[22:29] or spirit but he'd always would call the
[22:31] center part
[22:33] the center of man you know would be
[22:36] the part where that
[22:41] you know
[22:42] it it has only one sense it's either
[22:45] faith or doubt
[22:46] so then that way it doesn't matter what
[22:48] is called a wording
[22:50] is you get the point of what's being
[22:52] said because i've told you you go
[22:55] through it and check it out take your
[22:57] concordance and run the word spirit
[23:00] or run the word soul
[23:02] and and you can't run the scriptures to
[23:04] find out a lot of what that's talking
[23:05] about because it'll interrelate the same
[23:08] word
[23:09] backwards and forth you know all right
[23:11] and as it does see the the only way you
[23:14] can tell what is being talked about is
[23:17] get the text is in
[23:19] get what it's doing
[23:21] and then you can understand what's being
[23:22] said because it'll describe it
[23:24] especially when you remember
[23:28] if it's something about see taste fill
[23:29] smell in here
[23:32] you don't want to put that in the soul
[23:33] do you
[23:34] no that's not there that's this outside
[23:37] part of us
[23:38] then if it's memory reason conscience
[23:41] affections
[23:42] we don't put that as the center
[23:44] controlling factor of all of us
[23:46] we put that as the
[23:48] second realm of mankind
[23:50] all right
[23:51] then the center realm of mankind is
[23:53] either faith or doubt
[23:54] we're either born again or we're not
[23:56] born again that's right
[23:58] see the new birth is not in your body
[24:00] the new birth is not in your spirit
[24:03] you know
[24:04] it's in that inner part of you that we
[24:06] call the soul
[24:08] all right and the bible doesn't say that
[24:10] the spirit that sinners shall die says
[24:12] the soul that sinneth that's right the
[24:13] soul is the center part of us the part
[24:16] that makes us operate
[24:18] and makes us different than an animal
[24:20] remember what we've been going through
[24:21] the animals don't have a soul right but
[24:24] yet they have a uh sea taste field
[24:26] smelling here part of them they have a
[24:28] certain amount which is controlled of
[24:31] memory reason conscious affections etc
[24:34] they have those things in the animal
[24:36] realm all right
[24:37] but they don't have that soul part or
[24:40] center part
[24:41] to be able to
[24:44] change and be different and all they
[24:47] just keep building their nests the same
[24:48] way
[24:49] you know they keep doing the same things
[24:51] that they were doing four thousand six
[24:53] thousand years ago you know because it
[24:56] shows the soul of man is what god is
[24:58] dealing with
[24:59] all right the center part if you want to
[25:01] call it spirit in early ministry fine
[25:03] that's all right just get your senses
[25:05] lined up
[25:07] get the center part of you as to be
[25:08] either faith or doubt
[25:11] all right now we got it lined up there's
[25:13] no problem with with comprehending
[25:15] of what's being done because eve begin
[25:19] to reason
[25:22] all right
[25:27] as the devil began to talk to eve
[25:31] using the beast
[25:34] all right
[25:35] he began to talk to eve now we read
[25:38] during the bible where it says
[25:40] about the third chapter that the uh
[25:42] serpent was the most subtle of all
[25:44] beasts
[25:45] well there's a difference in a beast in
[25:47] a serpent
[25:48] a serpent is like a snake
[25:51] but a beast is an upright creature all
[25:53] right so you're reading your bible
[25:54] sensibly to understand
[25:56] what made him a snake
[25:59] was it not the curse that was put on
[26:03] and set upon thy belly shall thou go and
[26:06] thus shall be thou well evidently must
[26:08] have been some other form
[26:10] all right even scofield in his footnotes
[26:14] has
[26:15] references to this
[26:17] you know of a great man like that to
[26:19] have a comprehension of you know
[26:22] seeing that there was a difference
[26:24] all right
[26:26] now in doing that then we look at it
[26:28] as seeing
[26:30] what would happen in the garden
[26:35] all right we all agree to one thing or
[26:37] should be you know basically religious
[26:40] realms would agree to one point
[26:42] i'm talking about the basics of all
[26:44] christianity would be that it was
[26:46] unbelief in the garden
[26:49] unbelief
[26:51] because there's no sin but unbelief
[26:54] he that sinneth not
[26:56] see
[26:58] he that believeth not
[27:00] is condemned already
[27:04] if you don't believe you're just an
[27:05] unbeliever
[27:07] right
[27:08] now that has to be categorized or placed
[27:11] in an order to think about it because
[27:14] you know
[27:17] here we are
[27:18] today as human beings
[27:22] that we do sin
[27:24] but what is the sin that we sin is it
[27:26] drinking gambling smoking running around
[27:28] with women adultery etc no
[27:31] christians don't do that that's right
[27:33] amen all right does that solve the
[27:35] problem
[27:36] but what do we do
[27:39] we do as
[27:41] mankind you know we we doubt god's word
[27:46] and that is to what that is the point
[27:48] that
[27:50] that the serpent which would be
[27:51] representative of the devil
[27:54] what he's referred to all the way
[27:55] through the bible is the serpent over in
[27:57] revelation he talks about the devil the
[27:59] serpent and all et cetera
[28:01] because he's referred to as the serpent
[28:03] that's why it's called the seed of the
[28:05] serpent
[28:07] it's not called the seed of the beast
[28:08] it's called seed of the serpent
[28:10] why because the serpent
[28:13] even though he used the beast we'll get
[28:15] back to it a little bit but he had no
[28:17] seed of his own
[28:20] the serpent had no seed whatsoever the
[28:22] devil doesn't have a seed to plant he's
[28:24] not a human being
[28:26] he's not in that form a realm
[28:29] but he has an ability to pervert
[28:34] all right that's right
[28:35] so then as he perverts he starts in our
[28:37] thinking
[28:40] all right
[28:42] all sin starts from thinking
[28:46] all right
[28:48] we start thinking about something we
[28:50] start reasoning about it
[28:55] you say but i'm not an unbeliever
[28:56] brother dale i'm not talking about
[28:58] drinking gambling smoking because that's
[29:00] not sin
[29:02] he said what is the minute
[29:04] it's not no that's unbelief
[29:09] if you're a believer you don't do that
[29:10] right
[29:12] but yet we're all human beings and can
[29:14] be tempted in every way
[29:18] and we have to be careful with that
[29:20] because we can be
[29:22] no matter whether you're 90 or
[29:24] 16 you you got problems you're human
[29:26] beings living in a world
[29:29] really i say 90. you still think you
[29:31] might have alzheimer's but still
[29:32] thinking
[29:34] and most of the time you're thinking
[29:35] about the wrong thing
[29:37] you
[29:38] agree because that's the devil's inroad
[29:42] we have tried to cover
[29:44] what has taken had taken place there in
[29:47] the garden
[29:48] see satan goes through this mind we talk
[29:51] about brain
[29:54] he goes through and he contacts us
[29:57] to our memory reason conscious affection
[29:59] all right
[30:01] he said well you mean the doubt well now
[30:03] let me put it on the other side
[30:05] you know that god has to use those same
[30:07] senses
[30:08] to speak to you
[30:11] so you know
[30:13] you back well i'm not boy he don't get
[30:15] my
[30:16] you're already he's already got you
[30:20] he even talked to jesus
[30:23] right
[30:25] he tried to tempt him with everything
[30:26] right
[30:29] and if he tried to tempt him with it
[30:31] he wouldn't have come to him and told
[30:33] him to turn these stones into bread
[30:35] if jesus just got to eating about 40
[30:37] days of good fat meals
[30:40] when he waits 40 days until he gets
[30:42] hungry
[30:44] so he can contact him
[30:46] all right
[30:49] now then think about it
[30:53] satan uses those senses through your
[30:55] mind
[30:57] hearing
[30:59] faith comes by hearing
[31:00] hearing by the word
[31:03] all right
[31:04] but satan uses the same senses that god
[31:07] uses to contact us
[31:11] and i wish that
[31:13] that i could say that all of my senses
[31:16] are really controlled by god
[31:19] i wish i could say that but i'd be the
[31:20] biggest liar in the building
[31:22] right and then i'd tell you you're the
[31:24] biggest liar in the building
[31:26] all right
[31:27] i'd be like jack cole was when that lady
[31:30] told him said brother cole said i i just
[31:33] can't help but talk
[31:35] that i can't help it said i carry tails
[31:37] and do things and said i want to just
[31:40] lay my tongue on the altar
[31:43] he said ma'am that this alder is only 14
[31:46] foot long so there's not enough room for
[31:48] your tongue
[31:50] right now he was pretty blunt it was
[31:53] back in the in the pentecostal movement
[31:56] jack cole
[31:57] you know but that's true
[32:00] i wish that i could say that god talks
[32:03] to me more than the devil talks to me
[32:04] now he probably tries to
[32:07] but
[32:08] the devil beats him there
[32:12] i wake up in the middle of the night
[32:14] and i
[32:15] try to get up and pray but you know what
[32:17] the old devil's always there
[32:20] he's always there
[32:24] because remember he's using the same
[32:26] avenue
[32:28] the only difference in a sinner and a
[32:30] christian
[32:31] is the center part of that christian
[32:34] is born again
[32:36] then you birth you know it's in the soul
[32:39] at the center part of us all right and
[32:41] in doing that then god is on the inside
[32:45] and satan is trying to attack from the
[32:47] outside
[32:50] but as i said and i keep repeating
[32:52] because i want you to see it
[32:53] just because god is living in our soul
[32:57] he's not a secret
[33:00] telephone hookup
[33:03] that goes up into heaven
[33:05] you know
[33:07] no
[33:09] he's sitting in there waiting the holy
[33:11] ghost
[33:12] on you and i to bring him the word
[33:16] then he can send it right back out into
[33:18] the individual that can come out then so
[33:20] we got an inside teacher
[33:22] which is a wonderful situation
[33:25] but everything comes through your brain
[33:27] you're sitting there right now because
[33:29] the brain has to work
[33:31] somebody in a coma you might could say
[33:33] that they can hear and things like that
[33:35] but you know you know yourself they
[33:37] can't communicate
[33:40] but think about it satan's way into the
[33:42] human race then
[33:45] that he wanted to do in the garden
[33:47] was not the ability
[33:49] he didn't have the ability to create
[33:53] god could create to mankind
[33:55] satan couldn't create that was the thing
[33:57] that was withholding from him
[33:59] that's what made him upset
[34:01] but when he seen the human race
[34:04] he followed the animal line coming down
[34:07] the prophet said one day like this said
[34:09] satan has a principle a knowledge of the
[34:11] principles of life in other words
[34:13] meaning what life is about and et cetera
[34:15] doing and he could watch that line come
[34:18] down
[34:19] told you we believe in evolution
[34:22] creative evolution
[34:24] not we evolved from a monkey
[34:28] no we believe in creative evolution
[34:30] because he created the animals one
[34:32] higher than the other but then there's
[34:34] where they mess up by darwin see he
[34:37] couldn't cross from the monkey to the
[34:38] man
[34:40] because he couldn't find that missing
[34:41] link
[34:43] well lord if he read the bible he'd
[34:44] found it
[34:45] through the beast
[34:48] and realize the beast was an upright
[34:50] creature
[34:52] he could talk
[34:54] he did
[34:56] and communicated with eve
[34:58] you know
[34:59] but the devil
[35:01] come in him and used him
[35:04] all right i like to put these little
[35:06] things in because to me it's what goes
[35:09] with me and my nature in my way
[35:14] if it was eating apples
[35:18] see we'll get to it in a minute why did
[35:19] god curse the woman in childbearing
[35:22] that's right
[35:23] all right
[35:24] and
[35:26] why would it be then
[35:28] that if it's apples and things
[35:30] why would it be
[35:33] why didn't the apple go on the altar
[35:34] that cain was trying to offer
[35:36] you know the fruit
[35:38] right he did do that we're reading a
[35:40] little bit he offered fruit
[35:42] but it didn't work did it
[35:45] now
[35:46] why was it and why this is the little
[35:49] point i like to put in why was the
[35:51] animal
[35:52] used
[35:54] to make the atonement right amen right
[35:57] that's right
[35:58] damn it
[35:59] right
[36:00] the animal didn't have anything to do
[36:02] with it as far as we know of it you know
[36:06] right he had to do with it in the
[36:09] serpent used
[36:10] him to speak
[36:14] but because of that animal then the
[36:16] animal wound up being the atonement in
[36:18] the old testament right
[36:19] right
[36:22] it's an animal sacrifice
[36:24] that's what i like to put in something
[36:26] where you can go home and think about it
[36:28] later
[36:30] and say well you know oh yeah we believe
[36:32] this but but
[36:34] the animal was used
[36:38] and then we'll get down to it a little
[36:39] bit further in the message
[36:41] why did jesus have to be born
[36:43] of a woman
[36:48] he spoke a body into existence one day
[36:50] come down and talk
[36:52] to abraham was known as melchizedek
[36:56] why didn't he just speak another body
[36:57] and step right down
[36:59] see that's when all them pharisees and
[37:02] all them guys had it figured out the way
[37:03] it's supposed to come
[37:06] but he came by the wound
[37:09] why
[37:12] because the wound was a part of the
[37:13] curse right right what was cursed to
[37:16] childbearing
[37:18] all right you don't go out and get bit
[37:19] by snake
[37:21] and get you a wasp and stick the
[37:23] the stinger into you and it takes care
[37:25] of the
[37:26] no you get the antidote from the
[37:28] snake right
[37:31] to take for that
[37:33] because it won't work any other way all
[37:35] right just think about it
[37:37] see satan doesn't have the devil he does
[37:40] not have any form of a physical seed
[37:46] okay
[37:48] but he has a lie that he told eve
[37:52] right
[37:54] what was that lie
[37:57] and i'll tell you he started off with
[37:58] her now we're we're trying to get in the
[38:00] bible we read during jen
[38:03] but he started off and he said
[38:05] you know he didn't run up to eve and
[38:07] try to do something wrong or whatever he
[38:09] he said uh
[38:11] can you eat of all the trees you can eat
[38:13] of all these trees out you're in the
[38:14] garden can't you
[38:16] she come out to be a pretty good
[38:17] preacher
[38:19] she says no
[38:22] we can eat of all the trees except the
[38:24] tree
[38:25] that's in the midst of the garden
[38:28] see she was preaching to him he couldn't
[38:30] contact her no other way
[38:33] right
[38:35] you don't
[38:37] a friend of mine
[38:39] started studying a doctrine
[38:42] he used to work dart durable he was very
[38:44] highly educated back to as a matter of
[38:46] fact he was a bacteriologist creator of
[38:48] the bacteria stuff had his own used to
[38:51] have his own
[38:53] labs etc etc
[38:56] and very educated
[39:00] and she started talking to him about the
[39:02] bible
[39:04] first thing you know they were living
[39:06] together
[39:09] i tried to talk to him but
[39:11] there wasn't anything you could do well
[39:14] because she already had him suckered in
[39:17] because it's going to church
[39:21] right
[39:23] it's hard tell church people that
[39:24] they're wrong
[39:28] what do you mean i go to church every
[39:29] service i'm there i do this i pray i
[39:32] fast
[39:34] and then you say you're wrong
[39:37] what about the lord jesus telling those
[39:38] pharisees that they lived
[39:41] all of their life was religion
[39:44] the pharisees sadducees
[39:46] and he said you're of your father the
[39:48] devil
[39:51] you're illegitimate born
[39:54] wasn't that what they said to him
[39:56] now if it wasn't something happened in
[39:58] the garden it had to do with
[40:00] with sexology why would they say to
[40:02] jesus that you're illegitimate
[40:04] that's right
[40:07] you see there's a lot of little catches
[40:08] that just
[40:09] go along and then you build it up and
[40:11] you when you do you get a good
[40:12] understanding of what's going on but
[40:14] just remember now this that when we talk
[40:16] about the seed of the serpent
[40:21] just remember the seed of the serpent is
[40:23] unbelief
[40:25] amen
[40:26] then when he uses the beast
[40:31] to
[40:32] whatever you want to call it you gotta
[40:35] admit he talked through it
[40:36] you to admit he got eve to do something
[40:38] wrong
[40:39] right right to cause to fall
[40:42] all right you got to admit that that's
[40:44] that's not even sensible
[40:45] because you you read your own bible
[40:50] but remember it was unbelief
[40:54] all right
[40:56] but unbelief has a display
[41:00] right right drinking gambling smoking
[41:02] run around women etc is not sin but what
[41:04] is it it's an attribute of an unbelief
[41:09] if you're a believer you don't do that
[41:11] right
[41:11] that's what brother dale i just can't
[41:13] help it
[41:14] we'll get bored again
[41:20] you know like i told you the other day i
[41:22] read years ago about a girl
[41:24] she go to go to a strip tea she'd do a
[41:26] strip these acts when she got two she'd
[41:29] i don't know where she put on clothes i
[41:30] didn't read that part
[41:31] but she'd go down and talk to the people
[41:33] in the audience about the lord to try to
[41:35] get them saved
[41:37] from what that's right
[41:41] like brother gary said years ago
[41:44] they had it down there on 10th street
[41:47] when they had all that hippie movement
[41:49] love
[41:52] they want everybody to be in the love
[41:54] movement
[41:55] you get born again you don't have to
[41:57] worry about it
[41:58] but if that was what the
[42:00] problem was and we need to go down to
[42:02] 10th street and get in the live movement
[42:04] but no no no we got to get born again
[42:07] that's the difference right
[42:09] because what can take away unbelief
[42:13] all right
[42:14] what can take away unbelief
[42:20] see because that's the only thing that's
[42:22] where you start from
[42:24] but remember
[42:25] unbelief
[42:27] always has a display right
[42:32] right
[42:33] now are you listening with me
[42:35] unbelief
[42:36] always
[42:38] has a display
[42:42] you don't understand unbelievable i
[42:44] don't believe
[42:46] you go out and you display something
[42:49] an attribute comes from that that is
[42:52] displayed
[42:54] all right
[42:55] so you don't understand it i'm an
[42:57] unbeliever
[42:58] but it's not nothing bothering me i'm
[43:00] just an unbeliever
[43:02] now you're a liar too
[43:04] i don't mind saying it that way because
[43:05] it's true
[43:07] all right but unbelief always has a
[43:10] display
[43:12] if it was just unbelief
[43:15] is all that took place in the garden
[43:19] now come on
[43:22] if it was only unbelief
[43:26] nothing else happened
[43:30] then why did jesus christ have to die
[43:36] he could have dealt with the unbelief
[43:41] to nicodemus he could have said
[43:43] nicodemus
[43:46] all you got to do is just believe it
[43:48] believe in me
[43:51] he said i'm believing in you pretty good
[43:52] because i'm putting my life on the line
[43:54] my job and everything i'm down here
[43:55] trying to find out something right cause
[43:57] you got something different
[44:00] he said
[44:01] yeah
[44:02] you must be born again amen
[44:06] see if it was just totally unbelievable
[44:08] there's always an attribute of unbelief
[44:14] why do people leave churches
[44:18] i don't believe what you preach
[44:25] but you know yourself what always
[44:26] happens
[44:30] they get up and walk out
[44:32] right
[44:34] or either sit here
[44:38] and be worse
[44:41] right right so that's up that's that's
[44:44] i'm just trying to get a point across
[44:47] see eve never stopped believing in god
[44:50] right
[44:52] right
[44:55] she didn't stop believing in god she
[44:57] talked to him every day
[44:59] god come down in the cool of the evening
[45:02] they're in the garden
[45:05] they're still worth saying things you
[45:06] know
[45:08] come down and fellowship with adam and
[45:09] eve
[45:16] all right wife it had just been unbelief
[45:18] god could have sat down and reasoned
[45:20] with adam and eve
[45:22] amen
[45:24] right
[45:26] but that wasn't all of the things that
[45:28] satan wanted to do
[45:31] because satan because he couldn't create
[45:33] he couldn't get what he wanted
[45:36] he got one third of the angels to follow
[45:38] his doctrine in heaven right
[45:41] and when he came to earth he wanted to
[45:43] enter mankind
[45:47] and he knew he couldn't do that by
[45:49] creation because he couldn't create
[45:52] so what was the attribute
[45:56] then
[45:57] that went with the unbelief
[46:02] well he was they would eat an apple
[46:11] as i said eve didn't stop believing in
[46:13] god
[46:17] she just didn't believe what he said
[46:24] satan said
[46:26] you shall not die
[46:29] because god knows
[46:31] when you partake of this tree
[46:34] and remember it was tree of what now
[46:36] what we were on the other day tree of
[46:38] knowledge of good and evil
[46:41] funny funny-looking tree
[46:43] i ain't never found an apple tree yet
[46:47] that i could learn anything from that's
[46:49] right
[46:51] have you
[46:52] well it ought to be sensible that's not
[46:54] a tree
[47:01] so then
[47:03] she just doubted what god said
[47:11] because look at what satan told her
[47:13] we've been through that in the scripture
[47:15] you'll be as gods
[47:18] knowing good and evil
[47:22] everybody wants
[47:24] to have something over the other person
[47:26] right
[47:27] the ego remember a few weeks ago
[47:30] our ego is we want to be smarter
[47:37] you get in a group there's always one or
[47:39] two that's running their mouth
[47:42] right
[47:45] they're going to get their point across
[47:48] one way or the other
[47:51] now i'm going to say this but i'm not
[47:52] going to be sarcastic about it i was
[47:55] bringing out a scripture just the other
[47:56] week here and
[48:00] i'm just going to say what i think i
[48:01] don't think the man had ever thought
[48:03] about that scripture at all
[48:07] but he walked into my office and he said
[48:10] you know that scripture i think
[48:16] you remember what i said
[48:19] if you can't show me don't tell me i
[48:21] think
[48:23] don't say i don't agree with you
[48:26] if you don't agree with me tell me where
[48:28] you don't agree
[48:30] because if not that's a bunch of baloney
[48:33] because you don't know
[48:35] you're just trying to exert your little
[48:38] authority
[48:39] i don't agree with you well show me
[48:41] where i'm wrong
[48:43] well i don't know where you're wrong but
[48:45] i don't agree with you
[48:49] now that that's that's pisces stupidity
[48:52] josiah's big enough now to understand
[48:53] the words now i can use the word stupid
[48:55] josiah because i used to i'd use it and
[48:57] he'd say that word ain't good
[48:59] we need a little fella but you
[49:02] understand what i mean
[49:06] see i'm just trying to put in a few
[49:07] things and think about the scriptures
[49:11] just think about what they mean
[49:15] see you and i we don't disbelieve in god
[49:19] but yet the prophet says we sin
[49:21] he said i sin daily
[49:24] now what's he talking about
[49:28] he ain't talking about adultery and this
[49:30] and that any other right
[49:32] and neither is paul
[49:34] when he gets over in the scriptures
[49:36] talking about those times
[49:38] christians don't go out and do those
[49:40] things
[49:41] just admit it
[49:43] if we do them we're not christians
[49:48] no but we want to hide
[49:51] and we ain't hid
[49:54] but listen
[49:57] if christian sins then what's our sins
[50:02] if you sin from the soul you're lost
[50:05] i don't mind saying it that way
[50:08] because it can't be but just one or the
[50:10] other
[50:10] if you sin from the center realm it's
[50:12] got to be faith or doubt
[50:14] so it's going to be the devil or god one
[50:17] right there ain't no gray areas
[50:20] it's one or the other
[50:22] all right
[50:23] so then a christian cannot sin from the
[50:25] soul
[50:29] the inner being the center
[50:34] but we still have the body and the
[50:35] spirit to deal with
[50:38] we're with satan dealing with evac in
[50:40] her reasoning memory consciousness where
[50:42] does he deal with you and i right
[50:46] where does he deal with us at
[50:50] through our memory reason conscious
[50:51] affection because the body's not worth
[50:53] nothing anyway it's without the spirit
[50:54] it's dead it's what the bible says
[50:59] it doesn't work if we don't have the
[51:01] memory reason conscious all right
[51:04] but what was always amazing to me was
[51:08] go ahead and pull up number one brother
[51:10] which is the
[51:11] paragraph 37 of the god of this evil age
[51:14] where brother random would make this
[51:15] statement
[51:17] about eve in the garden
[51:20] you know what he would say
[51:25] he said this is the evil age
[51:27] to prove to satan she's not like eve
[51:30] that she's not that type of woman he's
[51:32] going to deport the bride she'll be
[51:34] tried by his word
[51:38] i wish i could say about an hour right
[51:39] there on tried by his word
[51:42] but brother dale we're christians
[51:44] we shouldn't be tried
[51:51] the bible says
[51:55] if you come to god you must be chastened
[51:58] tried
[52:00] yes but you i don't like the way you
[52:01] preach will come and show me where it's
[52:03] wrong
[52:08] you see that's the way for god to deal
[52:10] with you and i
[52:12] to see whether we're really real or not
[52:14] and you know he's not trying to get
[52:15] himself to find out whether we're real
[52:17] or not he's trying to get it to fight
[52:19] let us find out whether we're real or
[52:20] not
[52:21] right
[52:23] because he knows
[52:26] but look
[52:27] and she'll be tried by his word the
[52:29] bride is adam's bride was tried by the
[52:31] word and adam's bride believed every bit
[52:34] of the word
[52:36] all but confused on one promise
[52:40] that he's the same yesterday today and
[52:42] forever
[52:44] that's hebrews 13 8. well what do you
[52:46] mean brother death hebrews 13 8 wasn't
[52:48] he written back there
[52:52] it's the word of god right
[52:56] see eve doubted god would keep his word
[53:01] he told them
[53:04] that they'd die
[53:07] and like i told you the other day then
[53:09] that's where their deceiving part comes
[53:10] into mankind
[53:13] because he said today you eat thereof
[53:17] so the next day eve says
[53:19] adam i told you we wouldn't die
[53:22] right
[53:23] i told you we wouldn't die
[53:25] we didn't live 24 hours
[53:30] that day is a thousand years a thousand
[53:33] euros is a day is that the bible
[53:35] so even adam never lived a thousand
[53:37] years methuselah was 969 years old
[53:40] nobody's ever lived a thousand years
[53:43] but yet evc was deceived
[53:46] she thought she was right
[53:48] she still thinks he's right
[53:50] right
[53:52] so there she is and what happens she's
[53:54] confused on whether or not god will keep
[53:56] his word because if he is hebrews 13 8
[54:00] you believe that jesus christ is saying
[54:02] yesterday today and forever
[54:06] amen all right if that's true then god
[54:08] can't change his word
[54:13] right
[54:15] see whatever he says he's got to keep it
[54:18] all right
[54:19] so she was confused on that part of
[54:22] whether or not god would keep his word
[54:25] simple way of expressing what she was
[54:27] doing
[54:28] so she went after satan's lie and
[54:30] believed him
[54:32] still believes him
[54:35] right
[54:39] see then eve would begin to reason or
[54:42] disbelieve god's word
[54:46] and that would bring everything upon us
[54:50] either believeth not is condemned
[54:52] already
[54:54] we have to admit
[54:56] that whatever took place in the garden
[54:58] it brought death
[55:01] right
[55:02] upon mankind
[55:04] we have to go with that
[55:06] i mean anybody went out in high senses
[55:09] but agree to that point
[55:11] that it would bring death all right
[55:13] now
[55:17] so let's just get over to
[55:19] genesis 3 and let's just read a little
[55:21] bit and i want to get in the script
[55:22] we've been through these so don't worry
[55:24] about it we go to them again
[55:28] and and some of the things that i'm
[55:30] going to be bringing out
[55:32] today you'll find out wade brought him
[55:34] out wednesday
[55:35] and like he said we didn't talk about
[55:37] what was doing
[55:38] but uh we'll use a few of those phrases
[55:41] and things statements he made wednesday
[55:44] to connect together but look what
[55:46] happened in the garden now
[55:51] and the serpent was more subtle than he
[55:52] beast any beast of the field
[55:55] more deceiving
[55:57] right
[55:58] remember now
[56:00] the serpent was not a crawling snake
[56:04] right right
[56:07] because the scripture had already said
[56:09] the serpent was the most subtle of all
[56:11] beasts
[56:13] he was standing upright eve didn't talk
[56:15] to a snake
[56:17] even if he passed out apples i've never
[56:20] seen a snake with a hand yet
[56:23] he said was just silly that's what i'm
[56:25] talking about to show how silly we are
[56:29] right
[56:31] all right
[56:33] a serpent was more subtle than any beast
[56:35] of the field it's not talking about
[56:38] the physical beast to being more subtle
[56:41] he's talking about satan in the beast
[56:44] right amen
[56:46] okay
[56:48] and he said unto the woman
[56:49] yea hath god say it
[56:52] look at him
[56:53] you shall not eat of every
[56:56] tree of the garden
[56:59] he knew how to get to her
[57:02] she straightened him out
[57:04] she showed him how much her knowledge
[57:06] was
[57:08] right like i said the brother said
[57:11] i don't think that scripture means that
[57:14] i said well show me what it means
[57:17] well i just don't think it meant what
[57:19] you said
[57:27] it's hard to get rid of them oh egos
[57:28] ain't it
[57:33] you know what you can do the attack key
[57:35] goes right
[57:37] you get on brother chris there and talk
[57:39] about
[57:40] i don't even know his last name so don't
[57:42] even talk to me about trying to figure
[57:43] it out
[57:45] i'm sorry i just my memory is no good
[57:49] but
[57:50] say his family come over on the
[57:52] mayflower
[57:55] right
[57:57] come on
[57:59] how did he go in there my family came
[58:01] over the mayflower
[58:05] i told you mine was probably stowaways
[58:07] you know
[58:08] even though the name dale does come from
[58:10] titanic which is english and coming down
[58:12] but i don't have to do with it
[58:15] i told you that time that they was going
[58:16] to run the line to see if
[58:18] there was any of us you know that
[58:20] maybe
[58:23] had a tail you know looked like monkeys
[58:26] and
[58:27] got back so far and they found a bunch
[58:29] of his horse thief so they just
[58:31] found out they better quit
[58:34] egos will kill you
[58:37] right
[58:40] how do you feel when somebody walks up
[58:41] to you and says
[58:43] i'm like old brother tom farbush i used
[58:45] to get to tickle him i tell don't do
[58:47] that don't don't do it he walked up to
[58:50] god and he said
[58:51] my name's tom fox bush
[58:53] how you doing how was you baptized
[58:57] if you would baptize father son and holy
[58:59] ghost you're gonna die and go to hell
[59:02] because ain't nobody baptized in the
[59:03] bible like that
[59:05] ain't even got the guy's name yet
[59:08] that was tom okay we all loved tom
[59:11] you know that was his ways
[59:14] all right
[59:17] but see that little part of us called
[59:19] ego
[59:22] we want to be
[59:24] above other people
[59:27] we want to let everybody know
[59:29] what we believe
[59:31] i said tom
[59:32] don't talk to him about water baptism
[59:35] just talk a little bit here a little bit
[59:37] there
[59:39] brother dick's sitting there he knows i
[59:40] talked with him day in and day out for
[59:42] about a month
[59:44] never mentioned water baptism
[59:49] i talked to him about one god
[59:52] a few things you know
[59:54] and he said i see that one god
[59:57] it's not
[59:58] three you know god in three parts it's
[1:00:00] three manifestations of the same god i
[1:00:02] see you really believe that brother dick
[1:00:04] he said yeah i said what about this
[1:00:06] water baptism over here
[1:00:09] three or four weeks later
[1:00:12] see because that ego in that person my
[1:00:14] point is
[1:00:15] tom goes back to the
[1:00:18] church he was in
[1:00:20] talks to the pastor
[1:00:24] explains the scripture now you know tom
[1:00:26] if he explained to scripture he went
[1:00:28] from genesis to revelation to that guy
[1:00:30] about the water baptism
[1:00:32] he turned around the man he says what
[1:00:34] are you going to do about that
[1:00:37] right
[1:00:39] man said i'm going to take church
[1:00:40] tradition that's what he said now
[1:00:43] that's what tom said to mandolin said
[1:00:45] i'm going to take church tradition
[1:00:48] in other words it don't matter what all
[1:00:49] you said about
[1:00:51] the scriptures i'm going to stay with
[1:00:52] what i believe church tradition because
[1:00:54] he knew you'd get thrown out of the
[1:00:55] church
[1:00:56] the ego
[1:00:58] that's my point
[1:01:00] the eve had an ego
[1:01:02] satan you know how to touch it
[1:01:06] you can't eat of every one of them trees
[1:01:08] let me straighten you out on that
[1:01:12] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:01:13] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:01:15] garden
[1:01:18] you're wrong
[1:01:20] we needed the trees
[1:01:22] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:01:23] the midst of the garden god has said you
[1:01:25] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:01:28] touch it lest you die
[1:01:31] she explained it to him
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:37] that was her ego
[1:01:40] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:01:42] you shall not surely die
[1:01:45] didn't change a whole lot did it
[1:01:50] didn't lambaster about her belief
[1:01:55] he just eased around just a little bit
[1:01:59] and then he produced his
[1:02:01] thought
[1:02:03] for god doth know
[1:02:06] i'm telling you
[1:02:08] i got a knowledge about what god knows
[1:02:14] god knows that in the day you eat
[1:02:16] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:02:18] and you shall be his gods
[1:02:20] knowing good and evil
[1:02:23] she didn't know about good and evil
[1:02:25] she didn't know about being a god
[1:02:28] you know that adam was god of the earth
[1:02:31] am i right he named the animals he'd
[1:02:33] done everything he must have been
[1:02:34] something
[1:02:35] but he wasn't the god of heaven
[1:02:37] but he was the son of god the bible
[1:02:38] calls him down right
[1:02:40] now watch the woman comes back
[1:02:42] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:02:44] good for food
[1:02:48] remember it's a tree of knowledge of
[1:02:49] good and evil
[1:02:50] was good for food
[1:02:54] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:02:59] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:03:01] wise
[1:03:03] listen
[1:03:05] she took the fruit thereof and did eat
[1:03:06] and gave also one to her husband with
[1:03:09] her and he did eat
[1:03:12] now
[1:03:14] whatever you think about happened in the
[1:03:16] garden
[1:03:18] eating apples eating pomegranates
[1:03:20] peaches plums or
[1:03:22] whatever
[1:03:23] we've done established that the first
[1:03:25] thing is unbelief
[1:03:28] right
[1:03:30] so when eve disbelieved god that he
[1:03:32] would kill her the moment she took of it
[1:03:37] she convinced adam
[1:03:44] right
[1:03:46] you know what he he ate also
[1:03:51] she got him the reason
[1:03:53] that he'd never done before
[1:03:57] he said well wait a minute brother dale
[1:03:58] now let's straighten it let's try let's
[1:03:59] get you straightened out brother today
[1:04:01] cause adam was not deceived i'll agree
[1:04:03] with you that's what made him in bad
[1:04:05] shape
[1:04:06] had he been deceived
[1:04:08] he would have been in the same shape as
[1:04:10] eve and the atonement could have been
[1:04:12] made and stopped the whole thing
[1:04:15] just if it was purely unbelief in the
[1:04:17] mind god could have sat down and
[1:04:19] reasoned with them
[1:04:24] adam knew exactly what he was doing he
[1:04:26] knew that when he went with eve he was
[1:04:29] selling the human race
[1:04:34] he knew what it was taking place
[1:04:36] that's why the bible says in adam all
[1:04:38] die
[1:04:41] that was the worst unbelief that could
[1:04:43] ever be put in there that was what i
[1:04:45] talked about while ago
[1:04:48] you said brother dale i don't have no
[1:04:50] unbelief
[1:04:53] now can i quote brother branham without
[1:04:55] you getting upset with me
[1:05:01] he said that's why we're sick
[1:05:06] that's what he said now you need to
[1:05:07] quote
[1:05:10] he said that's why we're sick
[1:05:13] he said because of her unbelief
[1:05:20] with this but all you want to that's the
[1:05:21] billy goats
[1:05:26] you see we don't disbelieve god in the
[1:05:28] basis of who he is and what he is
[1:05:31] and we don't say because we quote by
[1:05:34] stripes i'm healed
[1:05:36] i'm saying we
[1:05:38] say by stripes i'm healed
[1:05:42] but then the devil comes in and what
[1:05:43] does he say
[1:05:44] well that's not meant for you
[1:05:49] that's for everybody else but that's not
[1:05:52] your case
[1:05:56] or
[1:05:59] you remember what you've done this week
[1:06:00] where you've done this wrong you've done
[1:06:01] this wrong you've done this wrong
[1:06:03] the devil says you're not worthy of him
[1:06:05] healing you
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:08] now just that one don't never come up
[1:06:11] if it don't it sure will now
[1:06:15] because the devil knows how to use that
[1:06:17] and he'll be talking to you the next
[1:06:18] thing he'll do is say you ain't worthy
[1:06:24] well none of us is worthy
[1:06:28] the only thing we're worthy of is
[1:06:30] hell even though we don't believe it's
[1:06:33] burning but it ought to be
[1:06:37] but listen church i know some of the
[1:06:38] young ones coming in i hit a little
[1:06:40] something
[1:06:41] and make you think a little bit and
[1:06:43] you know you say
[1:06:45] you don't believe in eternal hell i mean
[1:06:47] yeah and he said don't believe in a
[1:06:48] burning hell
[1:06:50] but death and hell remembers casting the
[1:06:52] lake of fire
[1:06:53] that's when it's burning
[1:06:55] it's going to be burnt up
[1:06:57] just remember those things
[1:06:59] but look
[1:07:00] and the eyes of them both were opened
[1:07:05] and they
[1:07:06] knew that they had
[1:07:08] had the bellyache
[1:07:15] you take two little kids maybe this is
[1:07:17] something in the families
[1:07:20] you got a little boy and a girl
[1:07:23] maybe a little boy two years old i'm
[1:07:25] basically three and four years old
[1:07:28] little girl too
[1:07:30] you can put them in a bathtub together
[1:07:34] they're not too bad
[1:07:36] right
[1:07:38] but don't be stupid
[1:07:40] and put them in there when they're 10
[1:07:42] years old
[1:07:44] now
[1:07:45] they're going to start looking at each
[1:07:47] other and they know they're different
[1:07:50] have some common sense oh my kids don't
[1:07:54] do that you blind stupid idiot
[1:07:58] can i make it any stronger
[1:08:04] you is that a way
[1:08:08] why can't you remember where you come
[1:08:09] from
[1:08:13] right
[1:08:16] don't put them kids out there in them
[1:08:18] situations
[1:08:21] you're creating something
[1:08:27] little kids thinks it's not too bad your
[1:08:29] mom and dad don't think too bad well
[1:08:31] they're not playing doctor
[1:08:36] you might or to go see what parts
[1:08:38] they're examining
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:48] just remember
[1:08:50] how your brain worked
[1:08:54] it might help
[1:08:58] now what happened
[1:09:03] as quick as the lord shows up
[1:09:06] or even before he shows up they will say
[1:09:08] we're naked
[1:09:10] and they sowed fig leaves together
[1:09:12] and made themselves aprons
[1:09:16] now like brother ernieville nueva says
[1:09:18] good point he said if they ate apples
[1:09:21] why didn't you make little bitty mittens
[1:09:22] why didn't god make little mittens and
[1:09:24] put it on their hand because they had to
[1:09:25] pick the apple up and look a little
[1:09:27] mitten and put it across your face you
[1:09:29] know
[1:09:30] and say
[1:09:31] that's what we've done
[1:09:36] no
[1:09:38] i don't think they put
[1:09:41] fig leaves
[1:09:43] over their heads
[1:09:49] could tell you a story about that where
[1:09:50] my mom and him wound up making some
[1:09:53] underclothes for the little girls that
[1:09:55] used to live next to us that didn't wear
[1:09:57] any
[1:10:00] and they thought well i'll straighten it
[1:10:01] all out they'll make a bunch of clothes
[1:10:02] you know
[1:10:04] under panties you know
[1:10:07] for the little girls little girls was
[1:10:08] from five to 18.
[1:10:12] they all took a bath out in the front
[1:10:13] yard in a tin tub
[1:10:17] and we was picking cotton right next to
[1:10:19] them
[1:10:21] that's why i said don't be dumb
[1:10:24] but they went down by there the next
[1:10:26] morning it's kind of funny but it'll
[1:10:27] shake that dryness off of you went down
[1:10:30] by the next morning and
[1:10:32] this lady she was kind of a little bit
[1:10:34] uh
[1:10:35] you don't like to use the word mentally
[1:10:36] slow
[1:10:38] slow
[1:10:39] because all of us is mentally
[1:10:44] was just a little slow
[1:10:46] you know what she was out hanging out
[1:10:48] clothes on the wash line you know where
[1:10:49] she had them panties at on her head for
[1:10:52] a head net
[1:10:55] he didn't get the point across the kids
[1:10:57] were still running around without any
[1:10:58] panties on
[1:11:02] come on
[1:11:04] you know what
[1:11:07] i'm not a i'm not an intelligent person
[1:11:10] and i'm definitely not a good speaker
[1:11:11] but i've read a lot about speakers and
[1:11:13] you know what gets her attention a
[1:11:15] little comical point that holds on
[1:11:17] so you'll remember that the rest of your
[1:11:19] days you'll remember that brother dale
[1:11:20] was telling about how that they changed
[1:11:22] that and when you do you remember what
[1:11:24] we were talking about
[1:11:28] they found out they were naked
[1:11:30] now when they made the fig leaves did
[1:11:31] they put the fig leaves on their head
[1:11:36] no
[1:11:37] i don't think so now do you
[1:11:39] i kind of think they covered up their
[1:11:40] private parts don't you
[1:11:44] i mean don't you think sensibly
[1:11:46] now why would if there wasn't something
[1:11:47] wrong there
[1:11:49] if it's unbelievable why didn't they
[1:11:50] cover their head
[1:11:51] because the unbelief's up here in the
[1:11:53] head
[1:11:55] but you see that's where people say why
[1:11:57] you preachers y'all just believe some
[1:11:59] silly stuff like that
[1:12:03] what took place we don't know it may
[1:12:05] have been a pomegranate
[1:12:08] well give me the scripture
[1:12:10] why did jesus have to be born from a
[1:12:12] woman
[1:12:13] why didn't he fall off the apple tree
[1:12:17] it's silly no it ain't silly it's a word
[1:12:20] of
[1:12:20] god they made themselves aprons
[1:12:23] you want brother branham's quote now for
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:26] he said they went back in the bushes
[1:12:31] with their fig leaf coverings
[1:12:35] and they were having church
[1:12:37] now you need that quote
[1:12:40] what was it having church about
[1:12:42] you you have church to try to learn
[1:12:43] truth don't you
[1:12:47] right you go to church try to learn the
[1:12:49] truth right i hope it's not show off
[1:12:51] your clothes because i'm in bad shape
[1:12:54] i come up here one day and i had on a
[1:12:56] black shoe and a brown one i walked
[1:12:58] around here all day long
[1:13:00] finally looked down myself and
[1:13:02] that's boy y'all pay attention what i
[1:13:04] dress
[1:13:05] you know one of you said i got a brown
[1:13:06] shoe and a black one on
[1:13:09] listen church
[1:13:12] you go to church to learn about god
[1:13:15] eve had adam back there trying to
[1:13:17] convince him that she was right
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:24] come on
[1:13:28] the prophet said they were back there
[1:13:29] having church
[1:13:31] now if you think that even adam wasn't a
[1:13:33] little bit spiritual
[1:13:35] don't forget
[1:13:38] i ask you a simple question another
[1:13:39] little point to put in just a thought
[1:13:42] why did they make them out of fig leaves
[1:13:46] now they certainly wouldn't have made it
[1:13:48] with a north american fig
[1:13:52] any of you ever had anything to do with
[1:13:53] fig leaves and
[1:13:55] they're rough as a cob
[1:13:58] now we saw a tree over there in israel
[1:14:01] and it didn't look like they were that
[1:14:03] but why did it say fig leaves
[1:14:10] why not
[1:14:12] peaches plums or apples or whatever
[1:14:15] why fig leaves why didn't somebody come
[1:14:16] up with the idea that what happened in
[1:14:18] the garden they ate figs
[1:14:20] because they could connect together at
[1:14:21] least
[1:14:25] but now let me show you something
[1:14:31] what is israel
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] is not israel referred to as a fig tree
[1:14:38] that's right in the
[1:14:40] bible see you've had a greater
[1:14:42] revelation you think she had
[1:14:45] just remember folks these two people
[1:14:47] that were sitting in their little church
[1:14:49] back in the bushes had eternal life in
[1:14:52] their souls
[1:14:57] and it was talking about
[1:14:59] god
[1:15:03] it's all i did come along to israel wind
[1:15:05] up being a fig tree
[1:15:08] maybe they know a little bit more than
[1:15:09] we think
[1:15:13] they said well no we know it's trees
[1:15:15] it's trees it's trees and he said adam
[1:15:18] you realize one of these days they're
[1:15:20] gonna call israel a fig tree
[1:15:22] you say oh they didn't know that back
[1:15:23] there
[1:15:25] uh just remember
[1:15:27] the devil has the knowledge of all
[1:15:30] things
[1:15:32] and he could be in the church with him
[1:15:34] you think he wasn't on the front row
[1:15:40] okay
[1:15:43] now look at it and they heard the voice
[1:15:44] of god the lord god walking in the
[1:15:46] garden in the cool of the day and adam
[1:15:48] and his wife hid themselves from the
[1:15:50] presence of the lord amongst the trees
[1:15:52] of the garden
[1:15:53] and the lord god called on adam and said
[1:15:55] unto him where aren't thou
[1:16:00] now you think he didn't know where they
[1:16:01] were at
[1:16:02] do you understand he knew where i wore
[1:16:04] this at right
[1:16:08] but he
[1:16:09] what are you doing over there
[1:16:12] you know what are you doing
[1:16:14] you see what's being said is this what
[1:16:16] are you doing
[1:16:17] he knew right where they was at
[1:16:19] he wasn't saying where art doubt no i
[1:16:21] can't find you i don't see you where you
[1:16:23] at
[1:16:25] no he was simply saying
[1:16:27] why are you over there with those fig
[1:16:29] leaves on
[1:16:34] okay
[1:16:39] watch what he said
[1:16:40] and i heard that voice in the garden and
[1:16:42] was afraid
[1:16:43] and he went afraid the day before
[1:16:46] why was it afraid because i was naked
[1:16:51] now they've been naked all their life
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:57] but when something happened they put on
[1:16:59] fake leaves
[1:17:03] and said was naked
[1:17:06] and i hid myself
[1:17:11] now if you'll notice
[1:17:14] you'll go back and read three i'm going
[1:17:16] to just take verse by verse if it takes
[1:17:18] us two or three weeks after this one
[1:17:19] night it's okay with me
[1:17:21] and the lord called unto eve
[1:17:24] uh read
[1:17:27] no adam
[1:17:32] and he
[1:17:34] adam
[1:17:38] right
[1:17:40] said i heard that voice in the garden
[1:17:41] and was afraid because i was naked and
[1:17:43] hid myself
[1:17:44] was adam doing the talking
[1:17:48] right
[1:17:49] and he said who told thee that i was
[1:17:51] naked
[1:17:55] you never had no problem before have you
[1:17:56] but once you wind up the naked you've
[1:17:59] got fig leaves wrapped around you
[1:18:02] and he said hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:18:04] where have i commanded thee that i
[1:18:06] should have knight
[1:18:10] and the man said
[1:18:11] the woman whom thou gave us me
[1:18:18] you see why it's so hard to preach to
[1:18:19] people and just keep it going
[1:18:22] because you see
[1:18:24] now adam is preaching to god
[1:18:33] who does he credit with getting the
[1:18:35] woman
[1:18:40] right
[1:18:42] he didn't say you know you know i found
[1:18:44] an apple tree out here and i jerked off
[1:18:45] a couple of apples and found a woman
[1:18:52] read your bible sometime for yourself
[1:18:54] say that read it real slow
[1:18:57] and think about what's being said
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:03] the woman
[1:19:05] who gave who thou gave us
[1:19:08] to be with me
[1:19:11] about three or four verses back up above
[1:19:13] there it called her his wife
[1:19:18] now he's saying god you gave me this
[1:19:20] woman
[1:19:24] she gave me
[1:19:26] of the tree and i did eat
[1:19:30] and the lord god said unto the woman
[1:19:33] what is this the taoist done
[1:19:35] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[1:19:37] me
[1:19:38] and i did eat
[1:19:43] said he beguiled me
[1:19:45] now he'd eat
[1:19:48] all right let's just get a little bit
[1:19:51] we'll quit and take it up this evening
[1:19:56] that word beguiled
[1:19:59] if you'll notice she didn't say the
[1:20:01] beast
[1:20:03] she said the serpent
[1:20:06] i want you to notice that
[1:20:09] keep in mind exactly what i'm saying now
[1:20:11] and don't
[1:20:12] self-interpret and run ahead of me
[1:20:16] because you're going to miss something
[1:20:21] and you're going to be as blind as a dog
[1:20:23] in the old blind dog in the meat house
[1:20:25] as to what brother branham actually said
[1:20:30] but yet you're going to be so spiritual
[1:20:32] until you ain't going to listen
[1:20:36] remember the tree of knowledge of good
[1:20:38] and evil is still there and the free
[1:20:39] moral agency is allowing each one of us
[1:20:41] sitting here to have our own thoughts
[1:20:47] okay
[1:20:50] she said the serpent beguiled me
[1:20:55] now the serpent
[1:20:58] beguiled her
[1:21:01] begilder what does begotten mean
[1:21:09] now notice i said she didn't say this
[1:21:12] the beast beguiled me
[1:21:19] the word begowed
[1:21:21] there is taken from the hebrew lexicon
[1:21:23] 53
[1:21:24] 77
[1:21:26] it means to beguile it means to deceive
[1:21:31] it means to be beguiled
[1:21:36] to beguile or deceive
[1:21:39] all
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:42] now as white said the other day it's not
[1:21:44] showed up on here because they take it
[1:21:46] off doing it
[1:21:47] but in your
[1:21:49] looking in your strongest concordance
[1:21:51] it'll say right through here
[1:21:53] it'll say to see where this word is used
[1:21:56] in other places in the bible i said
[1:21:58] click on this
[1:22:00] all right if you go click on that now
[1:22:02] i'm going to tell you some of you
[1:22:03] looking it up
[1:22:05] the word beguiled
[1:22:07] is only used four times i think in the
[1:22:09] old testament one time in the new
[1:22:12] all right but 12 times in the old
[1:22:14] testament alone the word beguiled is
[1:22:15] translated deceived
[1:22:18] click on that little space up there and
[1:22:20] it'll bring you right down
[1:22:22] it means deceived okay beguile deceived
[1:22:25] to be because of you all right
[1:22:27] okay they got it up here okay click here
[1:22:29] in all verses you use this hebrew word
[1:22:31] just click on that sometime
[1:22:35] and see you'll find out that that word
[1:22:37] deceived is translated beguiled roll it
[1:22:40] on up i mean just because it's
[1:22:42] translated
[1:22:43] uh
[1:22:45] okay you'll have to take this off to get
[1:22:46] back down
[1:22:48] because you're pulling up the rest of it
[1:22:51] look what it says
[1:22:54] the word deceived
[1:22:56] the word beguiled is taken not as usual
[1:22:58] one
[1:22:59] from over die one and three the pride of
[1:23:01] thine heart hath deceived thee
[1:23:05] in the pride of thine heart hath
[1:23:06] beguiled thee
[1:23:10] all right
[1:23:12] click on those things sometimes and you
[1:23:14] really get a lot of references and a lot
[1:23:15] of things to enjoy
[1:23:18] because it's used 12 times in the old
[1:23:20] testament translated
[1:23:22] deceived instead of begiled right
[1:23:25] all right
[1:23:26] it's only used five times four in the
[1:23:28] old testament
[1:23:29] and one in the new all right
[1:23:34] the one in the new is what coming up to
[1:23:36] the next we know it very familiar
[1:23:39] second corinthians 11 3 but i fear that
[1:23:41] lest by any means as the serpent
[1:23:43] beguiled
[1:23:45] eve
[1:23:46] through his subtility that's what paul's
[1:23:48] saying right so your mind should be
[1:23:50] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:23:52] christ
[1:23:53] okay here's the definition of that word
[1:23:56] beguiled from the new testament form
[1:23:59] is 18 18.
[1:24:01] all right
[1:24:02] it means to deceive
[1:24:04] beguile to deceive
[1:24:07] all right
[1:24:08] now so using our form of what we're
[1:24:10] talking about the word beguiled is only
[1:24:13] used in the new testament one time but
[1:24:15] it's used four times
[1:24:17] translated as deceived
[1:24:19] you know
[1:24:21] taken from romans 18 and 16 and 8 for
[1:24:24] they that are served not their lord
[1:24:26] jesus christ but their own belly and by
[1:24:30] good words and for our speeches deceive
[1:24:34] the hearts
[1:24:35] of the simple
[1:24:37] beguiled the hearts
[1:24:39] of the simple
[1:24:41] so he said the serpent beguiled me
[1:24:45] all right
[1:24:48] so what happens
[1:24:54] the word beguiled
[1:24:56] defiled
[1:24:59] let me lay it aside right there and just
[1:25:01] say this i'll come back to this this
[1:25:02] afternoon and pick it up and we'll come
[1:25:04] right to this point
[1:25:07] only got 12 minutes
[1:25:14] eve the serpent beguiled her
[1:25:19] he deceived her
[1:25:22] it means to
[1:25:23] intelligently
[1:25:25] convince somebody
[1:25:28] you know
[1:25:30] but i'll cover this this afternoon and
[1:25:32] somebody on the internet don't know when
[1:25:34] some of you that won't be here this
[1:25:35] evening
[1:25:37] just remember the prophet of god said
[1:25:39] the word beguiled
[1:25:41] is defiled
[1:25:47] now how did he come up with that
[1:25:52] when i just showed you can show you and
[1:25:54] will this evening that the word beguile
[1:25:56] means to deceive
[1:25:58] the word deceive
[1:26:00] means to be beguiled
[1:26:04] but your prophet comes up and he says
[1:26:09] beguile means to defile
[1:26:12] right
[1:26:15] and we'll give the definition this
[1:26:16] afternoon of defiled
[1:26:19] you know what that means
[1:26:21] ceremonially religiously
[1:26:24] sexually
[1:26:29] so the prophet's right
[1:26:32] because means to foul
[1:26:36] here's a little point to put in for you
[1:26:38] to think of
[1:26:42] the serpent beguiled eve
[1:26:47] through her reasonings etc
[1:26:51] the beast
[1:26:53] defiled eve's body
[1:26:56] so the prophet's exactly right and what
[1:26:58] he's saying
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:02] beast never beguiled eve
[1:27:06] that's right
[1:27:07] the serpent the goddess
[1:27:10] through her reasoning and memories etc
[1:27:12] working on that end of because the title
[1:27:14] of the message is from spiritual to
[1:27:16] natural
[1:27:18] we'll have to take it up and keep
[1:27:19] continuing this evening brother so
[1:27:22] from spiritual to natural
[1:27:25] eve accepted satan's lie
[1:27:28] and that beguiled her
[1:27:31] she was deceived
[1:27:33] she thought she was right
[1:27:38] then the beast
[1:27:40] came into being
[1:27:42] and if you can't see that it was sex in
[1:27:44] the garden
[1:27:47] now i'll just go ahead because i don't
[1:27:48] mind saying it to people because they
[1:27:50] want something to run with so go ahead
[1:27:52] run with this one
[1:27:53] it is no
[1:27:55] problem with religious society to talk
[1:27:58] about adam and eve in the garden having
[1:28:00] sex
[1:28:01] you say well i never heard nothing about
[1:28:02] it
[1:28:03] i went there and asked a few questions
[1:28:07] because you know what
[1:28:09] they believed just what wade was quoting
[1:28:10] wednesday just like what i was quoting
[1:28:12] right around brown said the woman is the
[1:28:15] tree
[1:28:16] he said the man is the tree
[1:28:19] but remember there's not a quote that
[1:28:22] adam is the tree of life
[1:28:24] it's always referring to jesus christ
[1:28:28] not a quote so go run all you want to
[1:28:30] find out but the religious world even
[1:28:32] believes that adam and eve had
[1:28:34] intercourse in the garden that they
[1:28:35] weren't supposed to had then they had it
[1:28:37] and here come the twins
[1:28:43] go on the internet and run that and see
[1:28:44] if you're going to find some churches
[1:28:46] teaching that
[1:28:48] and brother biscuit in them and i'm
[1:28:50] quoting him now
[1:28:52] according brother ernie it was quoting
[1:28:53] him
[1:28:54] maybe he even said it in his message
[1:28:57] but when rabbi richmond and him was
[1:28:58] talking to brother biskell and they were
[1:29:00] explaining to him what happened
[1:29:02] he said
[1:29:04] it is no problem
[1:29:06] about intercourse
[1:29:10] in the garden
[1:29:12] because that's what man wants eve is the
[1:29:14] tree of life i mean the tree of death
[1:29:16] man is a tree of life
[1:29:18] they put them together in the garden and
[1:29:19] have sex they bring stuff
[1:29:22] that's religious they teach that
[1:29:25] that man says it's no problem thinking
[1:29:27] of
[1:29:28] adam and eve in the garden he said but
[1:29:30] the problem is thinking about even the
[1:29:32] beast
[1:29:33] so that gives us something to think
[1:29:34] about
[1:29:39] you see because
[1:29:40] if you don't believe and don't know what
[1:29:42] happened in the garden
[1:29:45] now i know i'm blunt sorry
[1:29:48] but go buy you a playboy magazine
[1:29:53] oh i ain't reading no stupid
[1:29:57] i ain't telling you to go out and do it
[1:29:58] i'm telling you what'll happen
[1:30:00] you go read a playboy magazine and
[1:30:02] they'll tell you in a hurry what
[1:30:04] happened in the garden
[1:30:08] but the preachers are so super religious
[1:30:10] and so oh that's that's all i wouldn't
[1:30:12] oh i wouldn't do that
[1:30:13] they used to laugh at me at work
[1:30:16] i worked with this black guy that right
[1:30:18] beside his name was bec fine friend of
[1:30:20] mine
[1:30:22] you know what he had on one end we had a
[1:30:24] little table about this little stool
[1:30:25] about this bit on one end of his stool
[1:30:28] he had playboy magazines
[1:30:30] on the other end of the stool i had the
[1:30:32] bible and around his books
[1:30:34] and they'd come by just dying to life
[1:30:36] and said we ain't never seen nothing
[1:30:37] like it
[1:30:41] i said well you don't see me going
[1:30:48] i'm human
[1:30:51] so i've done a series on the pyramids
[1:30:53] one day
[1:30:56] luther said i got a book i'd like for
[1:30:58] you to read
[1:30:59] on the
[1:31:00] pyramids i said bring it to me
[1:31:04] he did you know what it was playboy

[1:31:11] in egypt i'm sitting in the office of
[1:31:13] the boss reading a play more magazine
[1:31:17] some guys came down through there and
[1:31:18] looked over the little cubicle office
[1:31:19] and oh we caught the preacher we got the
[1:31:22] preacher he's in here with the playboy
[1:31:24] magazine
[1:31:25] that black guy
[1:31:27] he grabbed that boy that said that
[1:31:29] and i mean forcefully grabbed him and
[1:31:30] just picked him up slammed him against
[1:31:32] that wall he said
[1:31:34] he's studying something to preach
[1:31:36] i give him the magazine and you leave
[1:31:38] him alone and you know that was never
[1:31:40] mentioned by nobody
[1:31:42] about the playboy magazine
[1:31:44] i brought it here
[1:31:47] because they had a lot of truth
[1:31:50] that's what i say
[1:31:51] if you want to know what happened in the
[1:31:53] garden go get your playboy magazine
[1:31:55] now i'm going to say it
[1:31:57] you'll find one
[1:31:59] where a snake is crawling over a woman
[1:32:08] you think people of the world don't know
[1:32:10] what happened in the garden but the
[1:32:11] preachers are super rich super religious
[1:32:15] we don't think dirty thoughts
[1:32:17] well what happened in the garden

[1:32:50] and she sat there and died laughing at
[1:32:52] me i said ma'am may something wrong with
[1:32:55] you physically thinking if you don't
[1:32:56] know what happened
[1:33:08] do you see what i'm talking about
[1:33:10] but we're so religious
[1:33:13] until we want to don't want to think
[1:33:14] about these things
[1:33:19] why
[1:33:21] did it make you mad cause i told you

[1:33:27] i'll raise my kids the way i want to put
[1:33:29] them in there
[1:33:34] but remember you're the devil that's
[1:33:36] leading them in the wrong way
[1:33:39] don't be deceived
[1:33:46] if they ate apples
[1:33:49] why did they have all the fig leaves in
[1:33:51] all of the things
[1:33:54] well why is it so important for us to
[1:33:56] know this why do you need to be born
[1:33:58] again
[1:34:05] if it was only unbelief why couldn't it
[1:34:08] be dealt with with nebuchadnezzar or you
[1:34:10] know jesus talking to
[1:34:12] nicodemus and saying nicodemus all you
[1:34:14] got to do believe you're saved because
[1:34:15] that's in the message now right oh we
[1:34:18] come in the world with eternal life we
[1:34:19] don't need to be saved
[1:34:25] one brother used to say hogwarts and
[1:34:27] that's pretty good

[1:34:30] it was dead
[1:34:33] and the only time we ever washed a hog

[1:35:06] from the wording why is everything
[1:35:09] connected to sexology
