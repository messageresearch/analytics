doctrines and and we've heard them and you've heard some and thank God if you've never heard of them but there's been some really strange ones and bad ones and and brother Dale and the different ones of that group has just they just mowed everything down and made it better for for young people like me and brother Willie to uh to be able to bring a message that I'm like him it's the greatest message ever was on the face of the Earth God did send us a prophet amen but more important he sent his word through that Prophet so that we have to don't have to depend on that Prophet to come back hello somebody we ain't got to depend on that Prophet to come back back and tell us anything he's already told us that's right he made he made the the Bible so much clearer he gave us Clarity amen and and freedom to be able to know the mind of God not guess that it's the mind of God but to know the mind of God and know what the plan is you know we've been preaching on the same thing Plan of Redemption you know it's everything hinges around the Plan of Redemption all right and uh let's U let's listen to our brother give him time he can come on and and uh let's sing whatever you want to

lift me up every day I Lord I love you more and every day I live Lord I love you more amen amen amen amen we we appreciate the Lord this this afternoon amen singing that song just kind of brings back memories of uh sister Lewis uh I had the privilege of pastoring her for a few years that's brother Jack that's my aunt and brother Jack Hunt I she's my aunt through marriage and that's brother Jack's Aunt his mother's sister and uh there would be times in church you preacher be preaching and she be writing songs it it's just so unfortunate that she she passed the away uh when she did because she left behind hundreds and hundreds of songs that she never had the opportunity to just even put music too and uh we don't even know where to find half of the things that she wrote uh that we could try to put music but we thank God for the things that uh she did and my my wife kind of put the always had to put the tune to it they would write it but my wife would kind of put produce it for him so we we appreciate the lord it's a blessing to know that that song has circled the world amen amen let us read our scripture uh uh this evening U Philippians chapter 4 we just like to say how much we've appreciate it it's I know it's it's a kind of a whirlwind short trip but uh sometimes that's the way that you have to do it but I've I've felt welcome since I've been here and uh like I say I salute uh brother Samuel Dale for uh all of the efforts that those uh Elders put forth to make it easy so that we could begin to even understand what we had and what what we we were preaching I remember when I first started preaching uh I didn't really know what I was preaching didn't really have a grasp and and then God threw me in the deep and say now you going to take this church over and I'm like huh you got to be kidding me no it's no joke you got to do it and and uh so by the grace of God it was it was a blessing that we had the opportunity to uh by way of of uh medium to just come across Great Men of God that had already uh had it kind of broken down so that we could halfway understanding and then the rest God had to just kind of Quicken it to us and so uh my hat soft to him and I I appreciate him uh very much for his his just his effort and his St in this area I know that it was not easy with my little portion that I've been able to do I know it hasn't been easy so them coming up during a time where it wasn't broken down we didn't have mp3s and we didn't have all of this you know Brothers used to come to the P pit with a stack of quot books like this see uh I'm kind of at the tail end of those ER those errors but we thank God for him and for his his wife he never could have done it by himself we thank God for her right we we like to salute the men of God but also without the women of God you know by their side giving them strength you know uh behind the scenes uh they wouldn't be able to do what they do so we appreciate the Lord also but brother Dale's wife where she's at brother Dale okay there she go so we we we we appreciate yall so standing in standing in the Gap amen and that just goes for every Minister that just goes for all of us we we what are we without our wives amen okay let us let us read the scripture and uh we'll we'll just kind of get started and just see how the Lord lead us uh the 18 verse it says but I have all and abound and I am full having received of I'm not going to try to pronounce that the things which were sent from you an odor of a sweet smell a sacrifice accept theable and pleasing to God but my God shall supply all your needs according to riches and glory in by Christ Jesus gracious father we just thank you we praise you oh God this evening we just trust that you'll just have your way in the service oh God this evening we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh we like we said we're using as a topic uh the purpose of the crushing and this morning we were just trying to draw a backround and just help us to understand that you know we we serve a sovereign God Amen and and you know when you could understand the purposes and the wise this it's like you know driving a car you know we we have things in it and to the conal mind you might what why is all this in there well it's the thing that's needed it's the things that's necessary to be able to get that thing down the road right amen no matter how pretty pretty it is if you don't have no matter if you got electrical car if you got a gas car without the batteries and electrical that thing ain't moving it look nice in your yard yeah you can shine it and you can polish it all you want to you know but but you got to you got to have some batteries or you got to have some some some gas and things of that nature something to power it so so you have to keep those different things in mind you just don't want to we just don't want to be like the carnal world today and and you know people have their own opinions about things where this ain't necessary and that ain't necessary and and and you know God this and God that see for me it's easy for me I feel like anything that God does God did it because it was necessary it had to be done I like to say that again it it had to be done and it had to be done the way that it was done right amen I mean when we think about when we think about you know the fall and sin coming into existence you know it it wasn't by chance that you know uh God would Veil himself come down a price had to be paid but the the cruelty right of sin and the price that had to be paid and him having to go through through capital punishment right but if you look back at at the picture when when when Adam got the Revelation or not Adam oh God y'all got y'all gave me food y'all gave me food so y'all might had to help me uh uh uh able when able my mind my body food and sleep don't work good together but but Abel when a got the revelation of what was what was necessary and what was needed by God right he he he dragged he dragged a a lamb and you know it wasn't pretty it it it it you know I don't know if we would have made it you're right some folk cuz we like pretty things Kan Cain brought something that was beautiful something that he cultivated within himself something that you know today's society you know people like nice stuff and you know Kan came out there man and got the lamb and he went to just po just hitting it right blood blood everywhere but he needed something that he could identify himself with right and so so you know Christ could not have come and had a easy a easy death if the representation of Christ died under that was cruel come on cuz just think about it if somebody held you down and start hitting you with a rock you be landed like hey that's cruel buddy that that hurts and I'm bleeding you know but the lamb the lamb uh uh uh sacrificed himself for you and I it wasn't a pretty picture no right it it wasn't you know when Easter time come you see pink buty rabbits and you see all of this and it's like y'all don't get it y'all really don't get it it was nothing nice Calvary wasn't nothing nice about Calvary to be to be drugged there you know you got a cross you You' done been beat you you and and let's let's say this all of that was necessary for the Pro progr of God and see here's what I like about it as as gruesome as it was it benefited me now I don't know about y'all I don't know what it done for y'all but I benefited from the cruy God God allowed himself to go through that cuz a price had to be paid I I like that right it it wasn't nothing is nice you know thank God that you know he didn't choose me fellas because we wouldn't have been redeemed you know it it was difficult so much that I mean let's let's be realistic Jesus with the Gethsemane he was like what is there any way I could get out of this right just just having an a knowledge of what he had to go through cuz let's let's face it your flesh don't want to hurt no your flesh don't want to die is that right when the when the man of God is preaching the word of God trying to bring this subject to the word it don't want to die it it don't want to give up it don't want to give in it just kind of want to have its way you know and so that's why we look funny at the preacher when they preaching and we don't hardly give him an amen sometime right because you know it it's it's something cutting and there's things in our lives that that that we want to do you know and but God's like no that ain't going to get you where get you where you want to go see and so you you kind of got a doubt of that right amen but you know when I look at Calvary uh and it and the picture of Calvary it it wasn't nothing easy but it it was it was necessary it was necessary right and and we benefit because of it right I I maybe you want to read us a little quote uh as we kind of get started y'all all right this good uh quote from I know 1960 and uh we want to start maybe somewhere around the 74th 75 th verse maybe the 75th verse it says see it it takes a crucifixion right amen uh we think that Christianity is just this you know nice something hey somebody should have told me I thank God for it now when I first became a Christian I didn't I didn't know what was going to take place you know I was just like praise the Lord I'm glad I'm saved right but I then I start realizing yeah you saved but you got to die there's a there's a cross to bear right amen he said it takes a crucifixion it takes a crushing of a flower right to bring the perfume from it it takes a crushing of a life I like this part to get the best out of it am right hey uh brother brother Dale was was kind of preluding to some of the things that I want to say it I now you know more than ever I understand why God allows and i' I've been going through a lot of things the last five years right but I realized that God saw that it was so important to just crush me yeah that's right brother y'all y'all y'all probably say oh no no no I I I really realize I got a greater understanding now right it's like God crushing me realizing that there was more there that he wanted to kind of get out of me to make a better make me a better version of my previous self and and that was the only setup the only provided way in order order to get out of us what's in US is that right amen God purposed that right to to crush right that's just God's method yeah and sometimes we don't like it especially modern day Christianity right we like this this cute religion now if you kind of look at the nominal world they got this real cute religion with cute sayings you know a modernistic uh Easter istic if I could use that term type of Christianity of beautiful flowers and and and uh you know praise and everything is nice and and and nothing is crushing nothing is cutting right but everything is nice right but I don't want that because that that won't bring out the the realness right the fullness of Christ amen right amen it it takes it takes a crushing amen see I was enjoying the brother's Sunday school lesson see it it takes that ideology away so that we we can really understand God's provision and how God uses things right go and and what God does things so when when God starts to crush us we don't bail out right we we just kind of say Okay God if if you brought me to it you'll bring me through it right if if you're allowing me to be crushed it's it's it it has its purpose it's it's for a a reason that's something that you know trying to get out of me get from me and it and it just takes this it it it takes this it took a crushing glory to God Amen see it takes the the crucifix it takes a crushing of the flower to bring out the perfume y right no crushing no perfume no right right glory to God amen amen it's it's got to be God's provided way you know God has a provided way for a baby to get right we you intellectualize it and okay baby you know when you need something I'm put this little bell up here baby like I got a bell for y all right you going to hear it too it going to be loud and long till you get up in here right it's it's kind of you know and I and I'll say that we we've got to be careful even around the word of God I don't kind of believe in legalism but I I you know I I still believe that you got to come God's provided weight also right so if God sees this it's necessary uh uh it's necessary amen who who thoughts supersede the thoughts of God who who did God consider when he was putting his plan and program amen uh into order if I could use that term right that glory to God I he definitely didn't want my opinion cuz I would have been like I whatever you do you can crush them don't crush me I don't want to go through anything right but it don't it don't work like that it don't work like that amen glory and and I'm and I'm grateful for that more so now than than than ever you know as we we're we're nearing the coming of the Lord and and we're trying God is is trying to get us you know in in rapturing condition um I believe he got to crush us a little bit more you got to crush us it's still so much that I think that you know we we're converted but we still things that we holding on to glory to his wonderful day I'm guilty too I'm not one of those types of preachers cuz I got a suit in the ti but I'm a human being right and that's human elements and and the world is sticky right and and we all in a contest right and the devil's trying to pull all of us so it's it's I'm in a battle every preacher could say he's in in a battle my battle may not be brother Dale's battle but I'm quite sure he's got a battle as if is as long as he's a human being now if he's a robot or something maybe he may not have the same batt battles but I I'm quite sure he's Flesh and Blood right oh Hallelujah so he says it takes a crushing of a life to to get the best out of that there is he says that's the reason Jesus had to be be Crush to bring forth what he was and we cannot stop right there is to bring out what we are as Sons and Daughters of God we got to go through this crushing the crushing of a life right the crushing of not just your dad the young people too Amen brother right you got to be kind of crushed see it takes a crushing of a life to get the best is that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was he could not stand before the crucifixion and say all power in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand but after the crucifixion so you see how necessary that that was right he couldn't stand and say all power in heaven Earth is given uh to my hand but what he did do it taking a crucifixion first it taking the crushing right it it see that it took that that's that that's what it it takes right let's let's look at a a a quote from the cruelty of sin 1953 uh I think it's starting at verse 8 uh brother brother brandom uh and one of the things we know Sin is Sin is cruel yeah we we can see this a this is a cruel age that we living in we we seeing things that uh we did not see years ago now I I I'm reminded and you know people a little bit older than me talk about they used to could leave their doors open and go to the market and stuff like that you ain't have to really worry about nobody coming into your dwelling right right you can't do that now I lock my doors I lock my car doors in my yard and I live on an acre why you locking your doors cuz people have no respect it used to be time a time where people would need you a even have to worry about a person coming up in here and B because there was a reverence for for ministers there was a reverence for churches now a reverence for nobody right amen but we thank God that Jesus Christ you know went to Cal he says uh God May every individual here go home tonight with this on their mind thinking of what a sacrifice we that's I think that's with that statement we we should always think about what a sacrifice was made for me cuz it's an individual thing right what did it cost to redeem right I couldn't pay the price no sir right I needed redeeming but I couldn't pay the price and to think about what he went through I benefit from that's what I like what what as cruel as it might have seemed capital to uh Roman capital punishment right I benefited from that I'm able to stand here tonight because of that right could could you imagine think about it if that had not have happened how how could we ever begin to talk about amen Redemption I mean we saw different things under the shadow right but we we needed a real reality to those things right is that right even John on the Alat say who who is worthy nothing could move he start weeping right but but thank God Amen God had Provisions right so that so that we could benefit from those things because of those things let me tell you something I'm grateful for that amen tonight being being an ex drug abuser y'all don't really know how how much I appreciate what he did for me is that right and and his leadership to bring me Amen to this amen present day light come on Church now I'm up here preaching you know but man when I read quotes like that I really know cuz I really know real real bondage see if you never been on crack and all of that you you might have know a little bondage but let me tell you something when those things get you heroin and crack cocaine and all of that stuff brother let me tell you something that's real bondage alcohol and you know all sorts of perverseness that those real real real bondages man that you need a real real real deliverer and then let me tell you something I look back 35 years right I got I you know I know I was saved in the mind of God but 35 years ago I recognized who I was you know uh I always in the mind of God but I came to and a birth took place amen right and now I can see the word let me tell you something I don't I don't take these things for granted I don't take these things lightly sir I really appreciate it appreciate these things right amen amen glory to God Amen he says what what a sacrifice what it cost to redeem what did it cost God yeah that's it right y it it cost it cost God the greatest Price it cost Christ his life amen right he was the rose of sharing but to get the perfume out of the Rose you have to crush it up amen right his beautiful life was crushed a young man 31 and A2 33 and have right that we watch this next statement that we might live you don't really know life until you converted you know you don't you don't really you can't really comprehend what real life is until you converted you know like I say yeah I was 15 before 16 and young and in church I thought man that's just old folk I got time and you know I felt like all of that but then as you know you start getting older you realize ain't no age limit to it that I'm going tell you something the earlier the better am even the prophet makes statements like that he wish he would have got and he got saved at a relatively young age but you know what I wish I wish something would have really struck me at a really younger age where I didn't go out and and Scar my life right by by the world I didn't scar it all up and and I still have to live even though I'm converted and God don't remember those things no more you know the devil the Devil is a a grave robber a ocean robber he goes down there to try to remind you you know but I I just kind of have to cast that stuff down and let them know that that that wasn't me that wasn't me that was somebody else impers uh some impersonator or something of that nature but you know you you have to you have to appreciate I'll say this to every young person in here God has given you the greatest opportunity of your life take it yes take it right amen allow God to have the preeminence in your life and and to take control and to lead you and guide you amen no matter how the devil try to paint a picture of how how nice and how how pretty and all of those things that the world is that's only amen uh a a a brown grass with a green light shining on it come on that's exactly what that is he make it seem like boy the grass is green more green over there KN it's just a brown grass with a green light shining on it amen this this is greener [Applause] pastures it it don't get no Greener not on this side it don't get no Greener this right now speaks of a better speaks of a greater but you got to accept this right now right man you don't you don't want to live with with all of that okay I like that he said he's the rosy but to get the perfume out of the Rose you have to be crushed my we thank God for it right Church you you you thank God uh for it because we we we benefit yes we we benefit okay I'm trying to get this next

he was in the building and folk get squirming and and if he sat by somebody they they they would move their seat you know they would move par book and on CZ cuz he had a he had a smell but but I I enjoyed him you know as as brother we a little bit different you know than than sisters we used to tolerate the smell and you couldn't really say anything to the Saints you know cuz boy you talking about uh months and months of smell yeah and and he needed perfume he needed a bath he needed good washing and and he needed uh a a perfume yeah he needed somebody to provide for him come on now that's right what was necessary to change that's good right how he smack glory to God so you see you know God realizing you know what Calvary is so necessary right because you know In the Flesh and in unbelief before conversion you ain't what you think you are come on now well I'm educated I got a lot of money I'll say that again you aren't what you think you are before God right amen Calvary is so necessary right to produce a perfume right so that we could smell better huh glory to God right brother y'all don't believe that but I'm grateful for that right so so that see had not had not Calvary taking place all that was locked up in him that's right all of all of what was necessary and all that that we would benefit from was locked up in him it was all locked up right amen but it needed to be released so that I could benefit from that amen glory to God glory to God Amen cuz I was smelly y'all know what I'm talking about your your your mama used to ever told you this oh you you think you

think you going to be staying with me forever at some point you got to leave here the eagle is going to start stirring the nest throwing all your stuff out God hey I want peace you know what what what what what was nice right yesterday when we got in town we went straight to uh brother D's parents house and man when I walked in there I was like wow wow everything was nice everything was in order and brother Dale say this this is a museum he he say he say he say man this is a museum in here you know they polish things and I'll be like what why you this he like man my mom had I'm I'm saying to myself one day Lord one day I envisioned this for myself I was kind of walking around and looking around cuz right now I'm remodeling my house and stuff is everywhere and I'm tripping over stuff and and then I got three boys and they Mama spoiled them and it's like I want to scream like dudes guys and they get mad when they hit when I get to talk and everybody head go down and and they don't really want to hear me and I have to apologize for what I'm fixing to say ahead of time to make it easy for them to get it to comprehend cuz I'm that mean Daddy when I talk I'm like EF Hutton everybody listen one of my sons used to tell me yeah Dad we know this is your house you ain't got to keep telling us yes I do evidently got to keep letting y'all know this is my house this is not y'all don't pay no bills here y'all live here for free and they think because they give me $150 $100 here and there you know because I've you know uh I'm making them now finally they think that they doing good I wish I could go back to my mama house you know and live for $150 woo woo yeah right y'all every every husband and wife ought to know what I'm talking about you can go back home with all of your children in heaven F $150 oh my goodness that'll be great feel like Tony the Tiger now great but it don't work like that you got to be you got to be responsible and that's why you got to be crushed and that's why I enjoyed the the the testimony this morning right oh my I like that I'm having a good time amen he said but let's get back to it he says I I feel good look Jesus he was the rose of Sharon he was offered to God as a sweet smelling Savor and and then when he becom then when we become unbearable before God what US I'mma go on on cuz y'all G to say that's the Tyrant that's the tant cuz sometime we do we we become unbearable before god let's think about brother brandom and and you know his his his mindset when he walked into that restaurant that day and he saw he saw he saw this this old woman and the police and and just the the scenery and just look at his attitude yeah you know he he like almost like Lord bring judgment down on this guy like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I I think you need to go through some more yeah right come on come over here and let me talk to you a minute right right let me let let me let me give you a real view right of of you yourself we talking about A A A God Called Prophet right but but he needed a little crushing we know he got a crushing at the early part of his ministry right and that let that that was heartbreaking right to lose to lose as as a young man your your wife and and your daughter right yeah that that would I don't know if I could have handled that I I don't know how many men that would have been strong enough to handle that you lose your wife and your baby and almost lose your baby boy you you know because of Disobedience right right right because her her daddy right got in the way of what God's will was for your life and God just had to show you who was boss I'm bigger than your I'm bigger than your father-in-law now you know uh I have ordained you you were born for such a time as this you was born to fulfill scriptural purpose that will be fulfilled right amen you know I I think it was a lot more to it than even that because brother brandham said said watching his little Sharon Rose suffer the way that she suffered right he said every time crossided children would get in the prayer line they been why I like thise the sovereignty of God see we could we we look at brother brandom and and and all things work together for the good right yeah yeah it may not be good yeah but but God's plan that's right God's purpose come on right glory to God God allowed that to happen yes he did right right God God allowed that to happen for the purpose knowing that there would be so many crossided children amen see we see this part but this part matter to God too glory to God this part mattered to God by the time by the time where brother Rand I'm paraphrasing talking about you know praying for this and you know different people and different things and and and God sent a a mother Pome to him right God was concerned come on come on man right right when Humanity probably want to just take the gun cuz I know if that was me in the flesh and no leading I probably would just ran in the house got a gun and just boom right but God was concerned right about that mother Pome God was amen not that Humanity was right but God was God said I got a man on the earth come go to him he'll get you he he'll get you what's needed right I have crushed him enough right yeah in him is is ability to pray right he'll get you on your feet right glory to God so it's necessary see what was in Jesus Christ I need it yeah amen I needed I needed blood y right right y right I need healing is cuz you can't preach one without the other you can't preach Redemption without healing right it's a dual atonement and I heard him talk about sick people right so that was needed God knew that with his stripes right oh that was C it was you know what sometimes you know thinking about what people go through things aren't always nice right that we go through but it's so necessary sometime for us to go through that to experience these things right glory to God see I could talk about things that if if you was on drugs you can't really talk about see you can't really really comp intellectually maybe if you study enough books of something well I don't have to study books to talk to you about you know drug addictions and gang violence and all that I don't have to talk to you about from book knowledge I could talk from personal experience right and and and we living in the age now of gang culture more so than it's ever been right in the influence and the impact yeah yeah right and these things got to be preached around the reveal word because there's a constant tug and pull on our Young Generation I mean you know this this like I said earlier this this building should be able to hold uh the amount of people that probably come in and out and the families and their children and you know sometimes their children's children I think back you know coming up and and and and you know in the different churches the churches that I pastored and the churches as I'm a part of the amount of people that have come in the doors and sat for a season and and and all of that if if they were there and their families and their children and there children and children my God we'd have to build big buildings right but I guess the scripture say Fe not little flock and so you just have to appreciate being a Christian sir you got to appreciate you got toe really appreciate having uh servants like you know uh I've met today and that I've known you you can't take that for granted no right uh that's not that's not skim milk to have somebody who who is willing to put themselves on the line yes sir right right right and Pastor in the church for 23 years I think just about everybody in the building talked about me in a negative light and all I was ever trying to do was to point him to Jesus Christ brother Smiley I need to talk to you okay I I just talked about you and I just want to apologize they not going to fully tell you what everything they said but they just going to tell you just enough I talk and then they break down and crying and all that and and I'm a man I'm a human being you know you have to you have to say sister brother you know I forgive you you know and come out the next service and still preach Christ to him and and and not be offended not hold any animosity or nothing nothing of that nature cuz you got to realize they were anointed by the devil to give you a trial that's right to crush you to make you to make you that much more dependent upon him right glory to God I was telling them when I was when I was preaching this message at home you know uh and I'm I probably get to the quote here but I just kind of get it out there you know he was the lily of the valley right and and from that and from that Lily when it's crushed we get opium right that's right BR right we get opium and and opian opium is is for uh soothing I don't know about y'all but I think I I wouldn't be here this this this afternoon if it wasn't for the Opium yeah right come on yeah something something that'll give me a a peace yes that are quiet that's it right that something that that that quiets my spirit when it just seem like you know my world is falling apart and I don't have the answers to the questions right it just there there something that I because of cavalary that that's been given that I benefit right I from it see this this opium it keeps me mellow it keeps me from like Ping you know it it just keeps me even kill even kill no I try to I try to be yeah every now and then I get a little red up but then he comes in to keep me settled right especially especially you know all of us cuz we rub elbows with the world most of us still in the workforce and we dealing with bosses and and and just people who aren't converted and things of that nature you need something that'll give you a peace when you come home when you something that settles you when you clock out and you sit in your car and you take a deep breath and say boy I'm glad them made hours over yeah that's right something that give you a piece that when you get to the door of your house you don't explode on your wife when she say hey honey yeah you know come on somebody or vice versa you know some of the sisters still work right you know you get to the door and and you like kids screaming and holling and you like yeah right y y'all know what I'm talking about I had six little ones they were stair steps right and they was good when they was out but when they was home they were everywhere into everything when they were screaming and they was holling and they was having a good time but Daddy just got off work work hard construction is hard construction is hard on the body especially the older you get and then not only that Daddy got a church and people be calling you and you got to study and they hauling they don't care cuz they kids and you just can't always say sit down and shut up you got to let them be kids you got to let them unwind this might be helping somebody who ain't got no kids yet that's going to have some kids you got to let them get it out so that when 8:00 comes they didn't got it all out then they could go to sleep even if you don't get none right but but you done have some opium yeah huh amen and and you on a high not like this this stuff they got out n this fent n and all that this stuff that kill you this won't kill you this this has no after effects to it right come on oh y'all just think y'all calm and peaceful on y' own y'all ain't went off and swung on somebody on y' own no y'all benefit from what amen I benefit from because he was crushed he was crushed you could be even killed you know you could keep it together yeah you benefit am glory to God Amen Hallelujah cuz when I was in sin buddy we fought all the time now it's like man I ain't got time for that yeah I just want to relax enjoy life be positive right amen but I thank God for the crushing amen yes sir right not Calvary but also person on a personal note right amen right right I thank God because by that amen it causes me to express more of the god that's in me right amen cuz character is a victory you got to go through some stuff see amen and listen others others benefit right amen by what we've gone through see I benefit by by what brother uh Dale and and those Elder ministers Mike Al and some of those those guys you know the fights that they had right Glory somebody had to do it right somebody had to do it that's right and God ordained for them to do it right and and I benefit from that I don't take that for granted that's that's a blessing to me and and even in my many years of of ministering you know sometimes I go back to the the older ministers right and just you know still [Music] glean glory to his wonderful name glean from the things that that you know that's right they might not be spinning around like the young guys but they have so much to say so much wisdom you know uh I don't I don't too much run the aisles anymore and kick and stomp but but out of all the years you know God has given us something that we could help this oncoming generation right amen and and we could give to the younger ministers coming up right and help them to see it's it's a lot more to it than kicking and stomping and getting the people riled up you know but but to give them a substance right that when they leave the church they could ponder over they could think about something that that that'll help in their growth right cuz when you 20 you ain't went through much or nothing I just have to say it like that uh but by the time you get 40 and 60 right you got really got something to say right right because you you don't went through a a whole a whole lot of a whole lot of stuff like like the brother was saying this morning I enjoyed that it's like you you you you get older and God quickens God quickens things to you and you you start to realizing you know what I need to be able to impart these things uh to this younger generation right younger younger men coming up so that so that that they don't enter into uh these these these lives with no Direction well you know yeah she cute she ain't had no babies she might be a Coca-Cola today tomorrow she could be a two leer you don't know H and and he got he got abs and six packs and know years he got dress of drawers you know you can pack stuff in right but but you have to have a knowledge you have to have a knowledge and understand your role and and and have some direction of of where you're going not just oh oh I'm in love that's wonderful but what are you doing what's your vision what's your vision for your family come on what's your vision for your wife yeah what what's your vision right what are you doing what are you going to do how are you going to care for right what's what's the necessary sacrifices that you got to make as as a man in your role to make her happy right cuz it's more to her than I just say sanify holy ghost fi going to church Wednesday and Sunday she going to need more than that buddy and full and the full of children and there you got to have a you got to have a real Vision right you you you you got to understand you got to be looking at these things now if you're not married have a vision where you going where you going to take this where you you know we ultimately going in the Rapture together but you know have it h try to halfway have things planned out right right and then have God to lead you but like me when I got married I just wanted to be married God gave me a wonderful uh sister in the message and you know and I was but I didn't have a clue cuz I didn't have a I had a daddy but he wasn't much cuz he didn't have a vision for my mama and then she you know all of the the stepdads I had they didn't have a vision they couldn't tell me nothing so so so I I I walked into those things blindly right and you know for me I don't want for a younger generation of men young Christian men to do that right always educate yourself keep educating yourself amen right every year try to educ that that's just for you know also us older older guys too we got to continue to educate ourselves and have a vision for our wives and for our families you know uh that nothing falls through the cracks I I trust that that was all right amen it it it I'm not a long- winded preacher I give you about an hour and 15 hour and I'm done you know uh I leared that as you get older you know you don't try to cuz you can't tell it all at one time it's it's it's just too much it's constantly be unfolding but we we trust that we were able to express a little something that was on our heart and that that um you just take your portion from what was said and and you ponder it you pray on it and let God Quicken more of it to you and and it'll benefit us we appreciate we appreciate the opportunity we appreciate the pastors for allowing me to be here um this weekend and uh maybe we come back we'll preach three hours no I I I don't think that's that's in me I couldn't take a three-hour message myself o I know some brothers dope when I was coming up man it was some of them some preachers would preach you talk for an hour and a half and say let's go straight to the word it's like huh what you been doing for an hour and a half if that wasn't the word and then they want to go another hour and a half you done yeah but we appreci let us stand we have a word of prayer and I turn it back over to brother Dale brother Wade brother Dale as the musicians and make their way amen anybody need any Prejudice sure by the lifting their hands y'all pray for me amen that God will give me strength yes sir gracious father we just thank you oh God you see the hands that went up this afternoon um we pray that you'll just bless your people you know their hearts you know their needs I just thank you and I praise you oh God tonight I I appreciate you oh God for allowing honors to be here and to be able to speak and just say something that we trust that's been encouraging Lord and uh appreciate uh brother Samuel and brother Wade uh this weekend and for the hospitality and the fellowship pray that you just continue to bless this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ and increase uh their territory Lord God we appreciate you oh God tonight we just thank you for all things in Jesus name amen and amen amen amen it's good when you come to church and you hear the word of God and you get some life lessons to go with it cuz you know what we're Christians but we got life what's old saying life happens yeah but when you get eternal life that life happens happens a little bit different let's let's give our brother another good hand you know as we were we're speaking on the Statue perfect man he and I were we were talking about it that takes a crushing too it takes a crushing it takes a crushing all the time to crush us out so that Christ can live in squeeze us I mean Ring us out that's right and that's why good preaching when you when when you hear good preaching it it it should release you and it should take some of the burden off of you and it should help you to tomorrow on Monday to uh to to go to work or to live your life just a little bit different cuz you know old Diablo he's going to be here you know he's the devil's going to be around but you don't have to you don't have to do what he says right you don't have to do what he says there's no way he can make you do what he tells you to do you have to do it willingly so we'll just resist the devil and he'll flee from us amen and U we appreciate our brother and let's let's sing a song if anybody has a need or anything else let's sing a a couple of verses and then we've got to get him to Atlanta to get on a plane so let's sing a song Let's worship just for a little [Music] bitfi baby by the stor he Liv and [Music] Dione think it think about it yes he was on the ground the fall and what did he do he thought of me it wasn't for him it was for me and you above all sing it to it he was crucified laid behind the stor you live to die rejected and alone like a ro trampled on the [Music] ground he did and he thought of me and [Music] you above all thank you Lord [Music] he you know the prophet of God said said don't ever forget Calvary I know we become message Believers and we should never forget what he done at Calvary what he done at the cross gave us the opportunity to be here and give us an opportunity to hear the message of the hour as our brother said what greater opportunity I know we all have opportunities to do better in our life but man you look out in that world and you see they never some of them are never even going to know who Jesus Christ is amen unless you tell them about him that's right and if we can't get to all of them I feel sorry for them all Hallelujah that's why we need to tell people about Calvary first before we tell them God sent a prophet amen God did send hisself first then he sent us a prophet to give give us Clarity and to give us um um more Revelation than than the world but not without Calvary no without Jesus Christ the Bible says you can't even know him without the Holy Ghost and now we know how to get the Holy Ghost cuz we God sent us a prophet it wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in tongues it wasn't shaking a hand as our brother said it wasn't writing on a a book or writing on a on a piece of paper no it's a birth yes it's something something you have to die to get if he had to die to give it to you you got to die to get it you got to die to yourself and let him crush us yes sir you think man that's tough but you know what a crushing blow at the Garden of Eden there was Adam he never felt a pain in his life Eve never felt a pain in in her life never a heartache or a trial that's right um the Lions could walk through the kitchen and right out the back door and no problem no problem right everything was in Harmony and then all of a sudden something happened it was a crushing blow to humanity yes but it had to happen so that God could come and be crushed and give us eternal life please let don't ever forget that don't ever forget what he did for us and the way we show it back is we tell people you know brother Brown says tell people how you got how you how your light got lit well tell them how you got crushed tell them how God took a piece of clay you know you Mary Magdalene when she was at the feet of Jesus she had a little box right the song you know about the alabaster box amen there was no way that odor could have got out till she crushed him that odor no matter how sweet no matter how odorous it was it was trapped inside that piece of clay until she broke the lid and everybody smelled it cuz Judas was complaining about using all of it and everybody was smelling it only by being crushed did people get to smell the odor that was in that Alabaster Box sometimes he has to do that with us he has to crush us he has to give us a blow that sometimes that maybe you know we're not going to we just don't feel like we're going to make it but we're here we got to fight be brave as the song says against all evil right and keep moving forward keep going on with God if you got issues in your life just keep praying keep keep doing whatever you need to do to get that thing cleared up right we're here to help you all we can help you if you need help we're here to listen to you to you and and you know you you take somebody like brother brother Smiley and and um and you you just you watch even the mannerisms you haven't lost being a pastor you know so you you just see the mannerisms of how he how he doesn't so much care about your flesh [Music] what brother Dale say he said I ain't worried about your flesh I ain't worried about your feelings right I'm talking to your soul today I'm talking to that real person down inside of you it may cut you and hurt your feelings but what brother Dell always tell us where where do he tell us to put our feelings in our pocket and sit on them brother Willie smiling he's probably hurting if he's Hur him enough and that's where we need to put our feelings and not let our feelings get involved but we're human beings and guess what we're full of feelings from the top of our head to the bottom of our feet so we've got to what Crush that all that we've got to get out and let it out and let's go on with God you love the Lord amen thank you all for being here we appreciate all of you coming um Brother Willie again thank you so very much I I I love it I don't bring a lot of times I don't bring people here for me I bring them for you and I tell them I I tell them everyone thank you for helping my people if you can help my people I'm not worried about nothing else I'm not worried about me or any or anything else when we went to eat or how the how the room was or how I got to take him two hours down to the airport and then two hours [Music] back it's to help you guys it's to help us all we all benefit from that every one of us to and uh and I know brother Smiley he felt comfortable today and I appreciate that that he did did feel comfortable and felt right at home cuz that's where he was supposed to be he said he had to go to the bathroom and he said I don't want to walk down to them people I said they're your family amen when I'm at home if I got to go I I don't yeah I'm going to go I ain't going to say no I got to walk past mama daddy no they family I just walk right on by them and go and do what I need to do amen thank you your face is red we're going to try to do something about that but it is kind of rough having to if you need to go to be in there and got a wall down through here but U but we're just family members we should feel comfortable around each other even though we came from totally different Mamas and totally different daddies Earthly we came from one heavenly father if you born again and we've got his genetics running through our veins now and we we've got as brother Brown says we've got his potentials as brother will said he's got to he was broke though so he could give us those or he just took them all with him no he didn't want to do that his whole purpose was to have a group of people that acted like him that's what he wanted a group of people that act just like him that's why he give us a statue perfect man that's why he give us three and a half years of his life and died and then came back and went inside of you not to be with you but to be in you amen and then take complete control of your life and we we're heading toward that right right yes sir amen all mine's clear y'all pray for us that there won't be any traffic and we'll get down to the airport and get him back home to okobe Florida ain't nothing down there but a big old Lake and some fishing but we sure want him to come back again we we don't want it to be uh um years and years and him and brother Jack both that we just appreciate ministers that come in and and um and pour the heart out and that's what I want they pour the heart out there they're worthy of their hire cuz it's like brother will and I were talking you know like Dad and different ones the older ones it's a it takes a toll this brother Bram told us that one sermon was an eight equivalent of working eight hours think of how many sermons y'all preach after your 8 hours you work right you know Dad worked at GM and and brother Woodley he hangs sheetrock and and finishes so he's not just got a desk job he works hard thank goodness he's taller I told him he didn't need SS to stand on but he said he still did wear stilts every once in a while but he don't get on them now he said if he fall it hurt itself so they won't let him on stils anymore so uh no more he said no more but it was good to have brother brother Smiley with us and we appreciate him and just just pray for us we'll get him back maybe later on in the year but just pray for us as we go down there and and pray for everybody to have a wonderful week and come back Wednesday night and then remember next weekend yes all right um Sunday first service will be regular service we'll have communion all right and then the second service start at 2 or 2:30 if we run too long 2: or 2:30 we'll have water baptism we'll have a vow renewal uh we'll probably have the water baptism last so that anybody wants to be baptized they won't have to come back in and wet clothes we'll have clothes you bring you Clos and we've got towels that we can use but we'll do the vow renewal we'll do the baby dedication or if you want to just dedic at your life to the Lord all over again then we'll have that service next Sunday afternoon that'll be the whole service and then we'll go have a water baptism and then you can stand fellowship if you want to so uh uh just keep all that in prayer um keep everything that that you've got in your heart about your family and your friends and and and I'm like Brother Willie if if we honestly had everybody that went through this church in the past 25 or 30 years yeah we'd have to build twice the size well you think I I think I running sorry I'm running them through my head you know like Robbie all right then you got your kids your kids all the ones that you amen if they're all sitting here you know that's what that's what I want I want them all sitting here well if it do then we're going to have to build a double decker but you know what that's what I want all right are wouldn't call their name or I
