[5:00] Revelations
[5:05] 1 1 through3 is the revelation of Jesus
[5:09] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[5:12] unto his servants things which must
[5:14] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[5:16] signified it by his Angel unto his
[5:18] servant John who by a record of the word
[5:21] of God and the test of the testimony of
[5:23] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[5:26] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[5:28] that hear the words of the prophecy and
[5:31] keep those things which are written
[5:32] therein for the time is at hand you
[5:35] remember years ago I preached on that I
[5:37] believe the time is at hand to
[5:40] understand this is the day and the hour
[5:42] to understand you may be seated Lord at
[5:44] his Blessing to the reading of the
[5:48] word now we said we we're going to try
[5:52] to get over to and uh mainly see what
[5:55] I'm doing if you'll catch it and watch
[5:58] it you'll see that we've already
[6:01] done what I'm going to do when I get
[6:05] over Revelations
[6:06] 5 so then if you watch what's this is
[6:09] not just play pry messages you know this
[6:13] is getting ready to be able to
[6:15] understand Revelations 5 and what I want
[6:17] to see for this day and the hour and if
[6:20] you'll listen and check what's being
[6:22] said
[6:24] now you'll see then what the truth of it
[6:27] really comes out to be all right now
[6:29] I'll just give you that in advance where
[6:31] you can do it all right we've talking
[6:33] about there uh this past Sunday on the
[6:38] This Book of Revelations and how that it
[6:41] was a revelation that God give to Jesus
[6:43] to give to John and and he delivered
[6:46] that down uh By An Angel and brought it
[6:49] to John and then it was to be brought
[6:53] unto you and I and we covered and just
[6:56] saying a few words about it
[6:58] that man kind couldn't understand the
[7:01] Book of
[7:02] Revelations until this end time when God
[7:05] would send the prophet yeah to
[7:07] understand you you see writings of the
[7:09] things and all but see the Book of
[7:11] Revelation was actually written uh in ad
[7:14] 95 and 96 or
[7:16] therea you know and uh so that way uh
[7:20] the writings of the other books were of
[7:22] the gospels and then some of Paul's
[7:24] writings earlier than that so basically
[7:27] everything would have been about
[7:28] finished and then that would have been
[7:29] the last writing you know the finishing
[7:32] of of the Apostles and things of their
[7:34] thoughts so then the Book of Revelations
[7:38] I've told you to me is a very special
[7:40] book but what's made it special is that
[7:43] God gave us the ability to understand it
[7:47] that's what makes it special to me all
[7:49] right and then it would would be there
[7:51] in the Book of Revelations would be the
[7:54] bride's
[7:55] book because it would be speaking about
[7:58] the bride and I will mention this
[8:00] basically every message and then you'll
[8:02] see when it fits in what we're talking
[8:05] about that nowhere in the Book of
[8:08] Revelation do you see Jesus by himself
[8:11] you see him in in Bride form or you see
[8:15] him with the bride like say Revelation
[8:17] 19 coming back riding you know with him
[8:19] and and things but you never see in the
[8:22] Book of Revelation anywhere that it's
[8:24] speaking just of Jesus and him by
[8:27] himself it's it's the it's the book to
[8:30] show us the future that would come to
[8:33] pass and you know and we could see those
[8:35] things and and have an understanding
[8:38] said then it would be our book for this
[8:40] enti and very special then to you and I
[8:43] to where that we can follow that book
[8:46] but we we got down to seeing that the
[8:48] Book of Revelation is one of the books
[8:50] that Satan hates he hates the Book of
[8:53] Genesis and he hates the Book of
[8:55] Revelations because it shows his
[8:57] beginning and it shows his end
[9:00] all right we covered that Sunday trying
[9:02] to to emphasize a little bit about it if
[9:05] Satan tries to tell you that you're lost
[9:07] just tell him no way in the world he'd
[9:09] ever be saved you could get a a white
[9:11] Throne judgment but he can't get it
[9:14] there's no white Throne judgment for
[9:16] Satan we could go there you know and do
[9:19] things but I don't want to but I mean
[9:21] it's just that way he he's lost out
[9:24] totally and and what I like about it is
[9:26] that even that the Satan and the f
[9:29] prophet and the Beast and is cast into
[9:31] the Lake of Fire before everything else
[9:35] is so it's going he's going to be
[9:37] annihilated one day and he hates that
[9:40] and he tries to discredit the word
[9:42] because he knows that as we were getting
[9:44] down to the end that if a bride gets a
[9:47] revelation of who she
[9:49] is all right and really of the two
[9:54] Spirits among the church and I told you
[9:58] then you go and you look at across the
[10:00] the message thing and you you'll see
[10:02] that there's uh definitely two Spirits
[10:05] at work right because any spirit that
[10:08] denies that Jesus Christ is com in the
[10:10] flesh is Antichrist and then when you
[10:13] see people off the word that it does not
[10:15] compare with Hebrews 13:8 then you know
[10:18] for short that that that's the other
[10:21] spirit all right so then the the thing
[10:24] of it is Satan will always attack the
[10:26] word amen right that's that's his way uh
[10:31] he doesn't care how much you shout and
[10:32] how much anointings you have and how
[10:34] much you know the moving of the spirit
[10:36] among you and the the different things
[10:38] he doesn't care about that right he's
[10:41] right in there with it he loves that
[10:42] himself he he likes to rejoice and have
[10:44] a good time but he's against the word
[10:47] being revealed right right and that's
[10:50] where I've always said to the people and
[10:52] you know it that why is people afraid of
[10:55] the
[10:56] seals uh the Daniel 70 weeks the the
[11:00] things you know uh that they want in in
[11:02] any way most of the time even attempt to
[11:05] speak on let alone anything else is to
[11:09] do you know they'll just uh pass it off
[11:12] I remember one church and some of you
[11:14] with our you know that they thought that
[11:16] well boy this brother is going to preach
[11:17] on the seals and he's going to play the
[11:19] tapes and he's going to preach on the
[11:20] seals what he did he played the tapes
[11:22] and and then he just went right on with
[11:24] his regular messages you know because I
[11:27] guess it didn't mean anything but he
[11:29] said you've heard the seals you know and
[11:32] all but that's fine that's well and good
[11:34] but I don't believe that's for you and I
[11:38] right that's all right maybe for
[11:39] somebody else that's that's fine that's
[11:42] that's good uh some people likes to eat
[11:44] some odd exotic foods but I kind of like
[11:49] to taste it and see whether I want it or
[11:51] not and don't just put it down there all
[11:53] at once and PMA plate up with it I'll
[11:55] get a little bit and try it because I
[11:57] I'm not the one to be gullible you know
[12:00] on all things all right but now there
[12:02] two Spirits we ended up by doing that
[12:04] brother R said one of them was the Holy
[12:06] Spirit we know that the other one is the
[12:11] Antichrist and don't look for the
[12:13] Antichrist in the last days to be like
[12:16] we've always thought you know I remember
[12:19] my brother-in-law was talking about the
[12:21] that the Beast would be a great big
[12:23] animal you know and it would
[12:25] just you know across the Earth and and
[12:28] to everybody and everybody worshiped it
[12:31] and stuff like that well it it's got to
[12:34] be something religious right it can't be
[12:38] just something uh you know a great big
[12:42] Monument of some form or some man or
[12:44] some point it's got to be a spirit
[12:47] that's there to create to make those
[12:49] people believe those things and express
[12:52] it you know in their own doings but then
[12:55] that way he hates the Book of
[12:57] Revelations because it shows his
[13:00] beginning and we went through that of
[13:02] this this Des scripture to show you
[13:04] there where it's the Deeds of the nians
[13:07] that was his beginning in the The Book
[13:11] of Revelations you know now we know he
[13:12] was there but I mean just giving a point
[13:14] that was his beginning of the Deeds of
[13:17] the nicians to conquer the Ley all right
[13:21] now you see that still prevalent among
[13:23] the ministers you know uh that they try
[13:27] to conquer the Ley by saying if you
[13:30] don't believe what I believe then you
[13:33] know do what you want to uh you're lost
[13:35] if you leave and that's the way a lot of
[13:38] people are told that if they leave the
[13:40] the certain churches they're lost
[13:43] well I've never told anybody that and
[13:46] the only thing I've ever said to anybody
[13:47] that leaves if you find any more word
[13:49] anywhere else than what we have here let
[13:51] me know I want to go with you right and
[13:53] that's a serious matter or get those
[13:55] people to come here you know to to give
[13:58] us understand standing to what we can do
[14:01] all right but now remember the point
[14:04] then the Book of Revelations will
[14:08] show the
[14:10] bride
[14:12] right right and that's Christ in the
[14:17] church and we'll read it in a minute
[14:19] that brother R said that Christ in the
[14:21] church was a
[14:24] continuation of the book of Acts right
[14:27] all right now
[14:30] we'll pick up where we read the last
[14:32] quote and get our thought for tonight
[14:34] you know of where uh that we were at so
[14:37] if you have the uh number five on the
[14:40] the board and some of you that didn't
[14:42] maybe keep yours we we didn't run off
[14:44] any to give you an extra copy tonight U
[14:48] you know but uh sister Julie you you
[14:50] just have to read the ones you took home
[14:52] when you get
[14:53] there okay all right but we just didn't
[14:57] run anymore cuz we just had all of these
[14:59] and then we'll pick up here all right
[15:02] now let's pick up the thought from where
[15:03] we left off on there on Sunday afternoon
[15:07] and continue there on with it all right
[15:10] this is page 16 of the church age book
[15:13] The revelation of Jesus Christ all right
[15:16] now watch you will recall that I
[15:18] mentioned at the beginning of this
[15:20] message that this book we are studying
[15:21] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[15:25] himself in the church
[15:31] now I I may I say it the best way that
[15:35] could be
[15:37] possible and I hope you understand it
[15:40] especially of people out there cuz you
[15:42] haven't heard me speak in the way I do
[15:45] speak I don't believe the Book of
[15:48] Revelations now
[15:50] listen added any
[15:53] great
[15:56] uh understanding
[16:00] of the
[16:02] godhead now listen to what I'm saying
[16:04] now very
[16:06] careful I believe Paul and him covered
[16:08] the godhead in the basis of where it was
[16:10] to be and the things and and that's why
[16:12] brother Brandon would go back and read
[16:14] those things to to reference from there
[16:17] and speak on that and you know he would
[16:20] do that now what I mean is all right see
[16:24] now what I mean by the
[16:26] point that what the book Book of
[16:29] Revelations does is show you where
[16:31] Christ
[16:34] is right right not as much as showing
[16:38] you a a a deeper Revelation except for
[16:42] the point of where he's at I think
[16:46] that's the depth of the Book of
[16:48] Revelations and I think that's the
[16:50] greatest thing that could ever be
[16:51] thought of that would be the Capstone
[16:54] revelation of the entire Bible would to
[16:57] be and to see that God would uh finally
[17:01] in finality reveal himself in his
[17:08] church all right and that you would see
[17:11] the
[17:15] church the bride not the world church
[17:18] now the bride all right you would see it
[17:21] in Bride
[17:23] form and that would be the Capstone of
[17:26] the entire Bible right all right and it
[17:30] would be that that even Paul and them
[17:34] understanding the godhead see look at
[17:36] Paul to come and to say that he was the
[17:39] uh you
[17:41] know Immortal Eternal almighty
[17:46] God and being who he was he would know
[17:49] the correct understanding of the Hebrew
[17:52] uh terminologies and do logos theophany
[17:57] uh whatever words would would come down
[18:00] he would know
[18:02] that all right and see brother randam
[18:05] come and stood upon what he said but to
[18:08] me the the Book of Revelations and
[18:10] you'll see this now when you get into
[18:12] Revelations 5 that the the the seals is
[18:17] the revealing Christ in the
[18:21] church that's where people are looking
[18:23] for the wrong way
[18:25] see Christ in his bride
[18:29] upon the
[18:30] Earth all right now that even Paul would
[18:34] speak of but not be able to
[18:37] comprehend and I don't mean that wrongly
[18:40] cuz you know what I'm
[18:41] saying see but we look for this message
[18:44] to bring us some kind of a
[18:47] um an understanding that was not in the
[18:52] Bible right we look for some
[18:56] Supernatural revelation
[18:59] that would not be in the
[19:02] book and then we try to make it to seven
[19:04] seal
[19:07] mystery you know and make it something
[19:10] that nobody had no idea well I don't
[19:13] agree with that never have never taught
[19:16] it that way and don't agree with
[19:19] it I believe it's more showing where
[19:21] he's
[19:23] at and what's taking
[19:26] place than it is to try trying to bring
[19:29] us some uh great Revelation they said to
[19:32] brother Rand said with your ability you
[19:34] could write a 23rd chapter you know
[19:37] Revelation he said see they was trying
[19:38] to trap me he said but you can't add to
[19:42] the word right so the Book of
[19:44] Revelations would not be adding to the
[19:47] writing of the other
[19:51] Apostles that would be a mysterious
[19:54] hidden secret coded something until you
[19:57] come in the end time and the prophet
[19:59] would tell us these
[20:03] things it would be what it's already
[20:05] spoken about well now if that's
[20:07] misunderstood I I tried I didn't mean to
[20:10] speak that way about it but uh that's a
[20:12] little premature to what I want to speak
[20:15] about 6 months down a row all right
[20:18] but I want you to think about it so look
[20:22] what he's saying
[20:23] now it's the
[20:26] Revelation this the actual revelation of
[20:29] Jesus himself in the
[20:33] church now and his work in the future
[20:39] ages now what did I mention that it
[20:42] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[20:44] Revelation or we'll fail to get it right
[20:48] all right
[20:50] now the Bible cannot be
[20:54] understood except the Holy Spirit be
[20:57] there to reveal right now no man can
[20:58] call Jesus Christ excepted be by the
[21:00] Holy Ghost all right baptism of the Holy
[21:02] Ghost okay now so then it's it's not a
[21:06] book it's not something added that's a
[21:09] secret
[21:13] coded it it's the actual showing where
[21:15] he's
[21:17] at and what's taking place all right I
[21:20] hope you're following the point now on
[21:22] that if not write down a thought on it
[21:24] and we'll talk about it see he said it
[21:28] takes a holy spirit to give us
[21:30] Revelation or we failed to get
[21:33] it now bringing these two thoughts
[21:37] together you'll see that it won't take
[21:39] just ordinary study and thinking to make
[21:42] this book real it is going to take the
[21:45] operation of the Holy
[21:48] Ghost that means this book can be
[21:50] revealed this book can't be revealed to
[21:54] anyone but a special class of people now
[21:57] that's what I'm talking about tonight a
[21:59] special class of
[22:01] people the the titles will be for until
[22:05] we get there it'll be uh a study on the
[22:07] Book of Revelations but then we'll give
[22:09] you secondary titles all
[22:12] right now watch what he
[22:17] says it can't be
[22:19] revealed to anyone but a special class
[22:22] of people all right right it will take
[22:26] one with prophetic insight right and now
[22:30] immediately when you're reading that
[22:32] your mind pulls into to the point of yes
[22:37] the prophet
[22:38] came he's got the prophetic Insight
[22:41] thank God that's what I've just
[22:44] said it couldn't be understood had God
[22:46] not sent us a prophet
[22:48] right there was no way to understand the
[22:51] Book of Revelations had God not sent a
[22:53] prophet unto us
[22:55] amen and we're definitely not not
[22:57] looking for another when to come are
[22:59] thinking that we're something we're
[23:01] telling you what the prophet
[23:03] said of course right everybody that's
[23:07] got a Doctrine says they're saying what
[23:10] the prophet says well all right one day
[23:13] that'll be decided right and that'll be
[23:16] finished so we don't have no problems
[23:19] you know we just walk on down the road
[23:21] believing what we believe all let the
[23:24] Holy Spirit reveal
[23:26] it see a special class of people it'll
[23:29] take one word prophetic Insight yeah but
[23:31] we're not prophets brother
[23:35] Dale no but we're in a prophetic
[23:38] age like I said Sunday why is the Eagles
[23:40] over everybody's door why is this called
[23:43] like an eagle age when even the world
[23:48] testifies because it's a prophetic age
[23:53] right now so you got your four combat
[23:56] Beast as we'll get back to later in what
[23:59] the line the ox the man the
[24:01] eagle all right everybody then wants to
[24:03] say the line was the word down in the
[24:05] ear Church ages do all the people the ox
[24:09] was the spirit of God among all the
[24:12] peoples the man was the spirit of God
[24:15] among all the people but then when you
[24:17] say eagle and brother Bram
[24:21] only like the brother said if you say
[24:24] you believe that Mark 16 is to be made
[24:26] manifest you're in bad shape he said
[24:29] because that's only for brother randam
[24:30] and the Lord
[24:32] Jesus now I wouldn't say that if I had
[24:34] heard the man say
[24:39] it but the point
[24:41] is see how could you make him Hebrews
[24:44] 13:8 right see then you see why people
[24:47] are just sitting waiting on a bus to
[24:49] pull up or they're sitting waiting on Ro
[24:52] ROM to come back driving the bus you
[24:58] to pick us
[24:59] up instead of
[25:02] believing and getting
[25:05] ready because how would you know what
[25:07] bus to get
[25:10] on cuz you better believe Satan's going
[25:12] to drive a bus up if that's what you
[25:17] think but if you don't know what the
[25:19] prophet has
[25:22] taught how are you going to know what he
[25:23] would teach if he did come back
[25:29] I man that's where I've always been that
[25:31] way I'm looking for him to to profit to
[25:34] raise one day and he can preach to us
[25:36] for 30 40 days I said that to you over
[25:38] and
[25:39] over but somebody's got to get him out
[25:42] of the Grave right so that's our job
[25:46] right to get into the faith sure don't
[25:49] look like it
[25:50] well exactly the way it is you can't see
[25:53] it without the holy spirit amen thank
[25:57] you now that's my whole point of tonight
[26:00] that you cannot I cannot we cannot
[26:02] comprehend the Bible without the Holy
[26:04] Spirit it takes a holy spirit to
[26:07] interpret that word unto us he said
[26:09] brother R interpret it well why is there
[26:11] so much problems with it right come
[26:14] on I'm as open as can be about what I
[26:17] say why is there so many different
[26:19] versions and splits among the people of
[26:21] the message if it was solely brother
[26:23] brandom was to tell us what it
[26:26] is I mean we got the books we got the
[26:29] the
[26:30] tapes what's the
[26:33] problem see but the problem is that
[26:36] people who say that don't mean what
[26:38] they're saying
[26:40] right
[26:41] right but see this is the age of the
[26:45] eagle age this is the prophetic age
[26:47] where do we get to it in the minut where
[26:48] the Prophet said the Holy Ghost came on
[26:50] a zeusa
[26:51] street in a great
[26:56] prophet now he call the Holy Spirit on
[26:59] the day of ausus streets
[27:01] 1906 the great
[27:04] prophet then the messenger was to come
[27:07] after
[27:10] them and see that's the basis of what I
[27:13] want you to see
[27:15] tonight see if you don't believe the
[27:17] holy spirit is here like it was on the
[27:19] day of
[27:23] Pentecost then how can you understand
[27:25] the Book of Revelation cuz you can't
[27:27] even understand the book of Acts without
[27:30] the Holy Spirit Come on right you can't
[27:32] understand Matthew Mark Luke and John
[27:34] without the Holy
[27:35] Spirit they're still arguing over
[27:37] whether the where Jesus said the the
[27:39] kingdom is within they're still arguing
[27:41] whether it was in him or in the people
[27:43] or somewh sitting out there Earth they
[27:45] can't get all that figured out they're
[27:47] still arguing over
[27:49] it but see church it's going to take a
[27:52] special people right we were chosen for
[27:55] this job amen
[27:59] I like that where he saved the best
[28:02] theas you know I have 13 kids I was a li
[28:06] one daddy save the best for
[28:13] Li but you see
[28:16] Church Why Can't We Believe well we
[28:18] don't want to get too exalted in
[28:20] ourselves don't you worry about getting
[28:23] exalted that's what a brother tell me
[28:25] one time I had corrected this brother
[28:28] and he said you better be careful about
[28:31] correcting that brother I said
[28:34] why why be careful about correcting him
[28:37] if he's wrong well you know how it is
[28:40] you could get all them demons all them
[28:43] spirits and to bother you I said don't
[28:45] worry about they plenty of them
[28:48] around they plenty of them bother me now
[28:51] I ain't worried about the rest as but
[28:53] think about it now a special class pull
[28:57] it back up brother
[28:59] I don't never know who's back there so
[29:01] now I'm going to start saying brother
[29:03] one of the sisters go back there I'll
[29:04] get in
[29:06] problem CU I can't never remember who's
[29:09] doing it thank God for all these
[29:11] brothers I do thank God for you there on
[29:15] the internet section if it wasn't for
[29:17] them you wouldn't have it I was going to
[29:19] announce something I forgot okay we're
[29:21] going to start as of Sunday playing
[29:25] about 8 to 10 minutes of music mus when
[29:28] they singing
[29:30] now now the singing will start right on
[29:34] 10:00 every who's going about: or
[29:36] whatever you'll start at 2:00 you'll
[29:38] start at 7:00 singing no singing we're
[29:41] just going to play and and do that now
[29:43] if you get happy in the Lord and worship
[29:45] that's fine all right but see the one
[29:49] reason is and I asked brother Joe to
[29:52] make sure see I had watched brother
[29:54] Pinkston we did the other night to see
[29:57] the brother that was preaching our
[29:58] Saturday and uh you know they started
[30:00] about 15 20 minutes early and just play
[30:02] that was fine that was good people
[30:04] coming in and all like that but my point
[30:07] was as I'd forgotten i' asked brother
[30:09] Joe I said uh when do you start putting
[30:11] this on on internet you know to go on
[30:16] live streaming or every how you say that
[30:18] I can't never get it streaming or
[30:20] Screaming most of the time I'm screaming
[30:22] and they're streaming I guess but sounds
[30:25] the same to me but anyhow I asked you
[30:27] and he said well we we put that at 9:45
[30:31] they start as quick as that video camera
[30:33] set up it it is on internet so that
[30:36] gives people an opportunity and that's
[30:38] what I was doing see I didn't know
[30:39] exactly how to get all this brother Joe
[30:41] and him had set it up to where I could
[30:42] get the the things but I'm still I'm
[30:44] sorry I'm a dummy so I called Brother
[30:46] Ray to make sure to find out and the
[30:48] reason I wanted to start early just say
[30:50] that so is see I figured it' take me 15
[30:53] minutes to get the thing
[30:55] on you know I'd have to call him did I
[30:57] do this I do this I do this I do this I
[31:00] do this he yeah do this now you done
[31:02] that wrong you know all so I wanted to
[31:05] know and see brother Joe puts it on 15
[31:07] minutes early every when that camera
[31:08] goes up it comes on 15 minutes early and
[31:12] that way people connecting on has a
[31:14] 15minute gap period that they can
[31:16] connect so we're going to have the
[31:18] playing 10 minutes early and then start
[31:22] to singing right on the period of time
[31:24] you know not sitting now and and you
[31:26] musicians and things don't start singing
[31:27] singing with it unless the congregation
[31:29] starts singing now if the congregation
[31:32] and I don't mean one person I mean the
[31:34] congregation starts joining in that's
[31:36] fine we all join in together that's okay
[31:39] but you know just having the the live
[31:42] music is what I'm wanting to do and also
[31:44] while I'm at it there is some
[31:46] announcement here from KS division about
[31:48] the camps and a testimony of a boy in
[31:51] here uh that was converted in a camp
[31:53] meeting and things and if you want these
[31:55] make sure you get them after service
[31:57] okay we get back back to where we were
[31:58] thank you huh now watch what it
[32:03] says it will take one with prophetic
[32:07] Insight now a special class of people
[32:11] with prophetic
[32:13] Insight people that have the
[32:17] ability to
[32:20] receive now you say well what makes us
[32:22] any different than anybody
[32:24] else it don't make us any different
[32:27] we'll get to that it's been the Holy
[32:29] Ghost in every Church age it's always
[32:31] been the Holy Spirit if it's not where's
[32:33] Hebrews 13:8 coming at that's right see
[32:36] you would would you would mess up with
[32:37] that one scripture it's always been the
[32:39] holy spirit in every church has
[32:41] everybody had a new birth had the Holy
[32:42] Spirit CU that is the new birth all
[32:45] right see then in doing that then it
[32:48] ends in the end time with a special
[32:50] people to when they receive the Holy
[32:53] Spirit and how the message
[33:00] to be able to get into the word no one
[33:04] ever had to message brother Joe had a
[33:05] good point the other day you notice it
[33:07] says in the voice of the the seventh
[33:09] angel you know when it begins to sound
[33:11] and see there's never been an age that
[33:13] they had a voice of their messenger now
[33:15] they may have had a little something
[33:16] because they was old systems back there
[33:19] of maybe but I'm talking about even the
[33:21] great Billy gram you don't have uh all
[33:24] of the messages he ever preached
[33:29] so it's something that God has
[33:31] captivated and made it into a
[33:36] voice a voice to where we can hear
[33:40] it see like those people said you know
[33:42] on the the TV thing about the the uh
[33:46] brother brand and everything there from
[33:48] Indiana you know and they said well you
[33:51] know they still play them same old tapes
[33:53] over and over well I thought Brother
[33:56] Joseph done a good job in his actually
[33:57] back to him we haven't heard any more
[33:59] from it I don't know but Brother Joseph
[34:01] said well we still read that same old
[34:06] Bible over and over and over I thought
[34:09] that's a good point you know that was
[34:11] good see but that won't go won't go in
[34:14] our way they'll cut off all they they
[34:17] will you know to do it but watch now I
[34:20] maybe not preached enough to get you
[34:21] settle down to listen what I'm talking
[34:23] about but one with prophetic Insight I
[34:25] believe the bride has to have prophetic
[34:27] Insight that's right I believe the
[34:30] baptism of the holy ghost that comes
[34:32] into the bride of Christ cuz this is the
[34:33] only age that we could reach the full
[34:36] maturity of
[34:38] adoption right all right you can come up
[34:40] and down through these ages and the
[34:42] things and the apostles had it right
[34:44] here but they didn't have the headstone
[34:45] now that's what your Prophet said all
[34:48] right he said The Headstone hadn't come
[34:50] yet all right so then the headstone but
[34:53] what is The
[34:54] Headstone I I believe Jesus Christ was
[34:57] The Headstone to you right I believe the
[34:59] headstone was riding on the White Donkey
[35:01] going into Jerusalem right right but who
[35:04] understood that's what it
[35:06] was who understood that was the
[35:08] fulfilling of all the
[35:12] Bible one man walking you know riding on
[35:14] a donkey fulfilling the
[35:17] Bible but who could understand and
[35:19] comprehend and
[35:21] believe that a bride of Christ on the
[35:23] earth in the end time standing with the
[35:26] prophet's message believe it not trying
[35:29] to interpret it or anything but
[35:31] believing it and accepting what's said
[35:33] to come to find out to realize who she
[35:35] is I believe the headstones got to be in
[35:38] the bride in the end
[35:40] time yes sir see we got a long ways to
[35:43] go to get there where I want to talk
[35:45] about it but see we are we are even
[35:47] going to be the anointing according to
[35:49] the prophet that we will be the
[35:51] anointing to the temple that goes into
[35:54] the
[35:54] Millennium you and I the bride will be
[35:57] the
[35:59] anointing but now that'll be all the
[36:01] bride that won't be just the end time
[36:04] bride it be all the right because it's
[36:06] the holy spirit it's always been the
[36:08] holy
[36:10] spirit all right so then what is it
[36:13] now it will require the ability to hear
[36:16] from
[36:17] God okay we got the prophet's
[36:20] message the Holy Spirit to teach us the
[36:23] message teachers in the body of Christ
[36:25] five-fold Ministry to bring her to the
[36:30] Perfection so we have all that is
[36:32] needing that's why it's a special class
[36:34] of people no one else has ever had it
[36:37] like
[36:38] this right all right and the tapes the
[36:41] books to compare
[36:43] it like brother Mo them used to say that
[36:46] they hear Brother brandom he'd say
[36:47] brother Mo was referenced to it one time
[36:49] he said he they heard brother brandom
[36:50] talk about said look at Adam and Eve
[36:52] walking out the
[36:53] garden well you know what they thought
[36:55] Adam and Eve was lost until they got the
[36:57] next message that brother R brought
[36:59] which might have been months before they
[37:00] got the next
[37:02] tape you know but when they got the tape
[37:05] they said see there Adam and Eve going
[37:07] out of the garden but said they had an
[37:08] atonement they wasn't
[37:10] lost amen I see but we have it all we
[37:15] just running the
[37:16] computer you want to know what the
[37:18] prophet said just type it
[37:20] in didn't said start reading all right
[37:26] listen you the ability to hear from God
[37:29] it will require Supernatural
[37:34] instruction that's something in it
[37:36] Supernatural
[37:39] instruction you don't believe the holy
[37:41] spirit is
[37:46] Supernatural Well that's the only thing
[37:48] that is Supernatural That's right there
[37:50] almighty god
[37:54] listen Supernatural instruction what's
[37:57] not just a student comparing verse with
[38:01] verse though that is
[38:03] good but her M requires the teaching of
[38:07] the spirit or it never becomes
[38:10] clear how we need to hear from God and
[38:14] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[38:17] the spirit to hear and
[38:20] know all right
[38:24] now special class of people
[38:28] so nobody can't take your
[38:31] place Paul had his place Iranians Martin
[38:34] Columbo those people down through there
[38:36] had their places brother brother R never
[38:38] tried to take FF bosler's
[38:43] place he always gave him honor and
[38:46] Glory CAU him the old shade
[38:49] tree know one man there you know got
[38:51] converted said go sit under the old sh
[38:53] Tree on Divine Healing
[38:58] he said the man know more about Divine
[38:59] Healing anybody some way something close
[39:02] to it anybody he know of was FF
[39:05] B brother never tried to take his place
[39:08] he didn't try to take Billy Graham or or
[39:10] Robert's
[39:13] place he didn't go after the
[39:15] multi-million dollar buildings and
[39:17] schools and things to to put them in
[39:20] there and pop out preachers to
[39:22] to deliver this message that's what old
[39:26] Robert's done right
[39:28] send them to
[39:31] school all but you
[39:35] see he settled down with one thing the
[39:38] word right right amen yes
[39:43] sir and when he did he comes out with
[39:45] that one thing the holy spirit because
[39:48] the holy spirit will always come to the
[39:50] word okay all right now as we start our
[39:53] point this is what we're talking
[39:56] about I believe the Holy Spirit has been
[40:00] the spirit that gave birth to every
[40:02] individual in any church age
[40:06] whatsoever my wife always said years ago
[40:08] it is not the spirit of God that was
[40:10] eaten down show me that anywhere in the
[40:13] prophet's message or in the
[40:16] Bible now that's an open challenge to
[40:18] the world
[40:20] come all right I'll admit it and go with
[40:23] brother ROM he said it's been trampled
[40:24] on sure has he talking about the Holy
[40:28] Spirit but there's nowhere where the
[40:30] Holy Spirit was ever taken away the word
[40:32] was what was eat
[40:37] down then had to be restored right
[40:40] brought back would the Holy Spirit had
[40:43] to be restored it was the Holy Spirit
[40:46] that revealed to Martin Luther that to
[40:47] just shall live by
[40:53] faith this the Holy Spirit has been
[40:56] there in every age so now let's just
[40:58] pick up a few and watch what is the holy
[41:02] spirit well brother Dale uh you know who
[41:06] is the
[41:09] prophet let me answer that people would
[41:12] say William Mary and
[41:16] Brandon
[41:19] right but who's the
[41:25] prophet simple question
[41:30] for him to be Hebrews
[41:33] 13:8 now who's the prophets so go ahead
[41:35] and pull up the next
[41:36] one and watch this is off the message 6
[41:40] 65725 the anointed ones the end time
[41:42] paragraph 98 99 on 100 the holy spirit
[41:46] is the prophet of this
[41:49] hour
[41:51] right now who's the prophet of the
[41:54] hour he of vindicating his word proving
[41:57] it the Holy Spirit was the prophet of
[42:00] Moses hour the Holy Spirit was the
[42:03] prophet of Mah's hour The Holy Spirits
[42:07] which wrote the word comes and confirmed
[42:10] the word all right now who is the
[42:13] prophet that was to be looked for in the
[42:16] end
[42:17] time I told you about it years ago and
[42:20] going off on the brother that's fine
[42:22] that's whatever believes but brother M
[42:26] brought this brother over to house and
[42:27] we were sitting out on the front porch
[42:28] and and
[42:30] uh we started talking and brother Mo
[42:33] said to the brother said just tell
[42:34] brother D what you believe the brother
[42:36] said yes said I believe
[42:39] that Malachi 4 is
[42:43] coming okay what else you
[42:45] believe he said well he said what I
[42:49] believe is that John the
[42:55] Baptist brought John the B just into
[42:58] it that he was Malachi
[43:02] 4 I said well who was Malachi
[43:06] 3 he was all confused and what I found
[43:09] out that he finally believed and he
[43:11] maybe even hear this tonight he
[43:12] sometimes he canect on evidently because
[43:14] they showed up in a in a a Bible study
[43:17] we having one time and the only way
[43:18] could have known it was an announced but
[43:23] anyhow he said well don't you believe
[43:26] brother brand no let let me get it right
[43:28] what he said he said brother Brandon was
[43:29] Malachi 3 let me get that
[43:31] right Malachi 3 said he was Maliki 3 I
[43:34] said well I thought that was John the
[43:36] Baptist you know and then brother Brown
[43:38] would be Miki 4 he said no no no said
[43:41] said brother Brown was Miki 3 I said in
[43:43] other words you're saying that somebody
[43:45] else to come he said yeah well see I
[43:46] didn't know it but it was told later he
[43:49] finally as he believes he was that one
[43:50] to come you well that's what I told
[43:53] him I said I'll just tell you to your
[43:56] face said I didn't know it's what he
[43:58] believed but I said If You Think You're
[44:00] Malachi
[44:01] 4 I just tell
[44:03] you you ain't him that's
[44:07] right I said even if brother Bram would
[44:10] have been Malachi
[44:13] 3 the one brother brandom was looking to
[44:15] come was the Lord Jesus
[44:19] Christ he said what about the great one
[44:21] I said that is a great one the Lord
[44:23] Jesus
[44:24] Christ brother R pointed to a great one
[44:27] to come the Lord Jesus Christ but he
[44:30] told you about Malachi
[44:33] 4 and where it was at in his ministry
[44:36] John the Baptist of Miki
[44:38] 3 well of course it didn't change his
[44:40] mind it ain't going to change yours or
[44:42] anybody else listening out there of what
[44:43] they believe it's not going to change
[44:45] what I say but there's one thing about
[44:46] it they will day a day that these things
[44:48] will face awful of us right amen sir Now
[44:53] who is the
[44:55] prophet of this
[44:58] power the Holy Spirit right now remember
[45:03] in Revelations 1910 go ahead brother I
[45:06] think he's got it on there CU we had
[45:07] these on him if you'll just fall it
[45:10] down Revelations 19:10 and says I fell
[45:13] at his feet to worship and said unto him
[45:15] see thou do it not am thy fellow I am
[45:19] thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren
[45:22] that have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[45:24] worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[45:26] Christ is the spirit of
[45:29] Prophecy that's Revelations
[45:32] 19:10 the testimony that Jesus Christ is
[45:35] a spirit of Prophecy all right so then
[45:37] who are we looking for to come and take
[45:39] over the Holy Spirit right not another
[45:44] messenger not another person to come
[45:46] along you know with an anointing of
[45:48] Elijah or something the next Elijah that
[45:50] is to come according to my understanding
[45:53] will be one of the two witnesses to
[45:54] Israel all right cu that'll be number
[45:57] five to finish it all up but the thing
[46:00] of what I want you to see tonight is one
[46:02] thing for certain now this is my whole
[46:04] point now you can differ with me
[46:06] whatever you want to do believe or not
[46:09] believe but if we do not have the new
[46:13] birth as it was on the day of
[46:18] Pentecost then we don't have the new
[46:21] birth
[46:23] right simple we don't have it we don't
[46:27] have it they don't need interpreting you
[46:29] know I liked it Sunday that sister would
[46:31] here visiting went outside and I tried
[46:33] to get her to write it down blood she
[46:35] she tried to get her husband prick his
[46:37] finger and he wouldn't do it but she
[46:39] said brother Dale said that was the most
[46:42] simple
[46:44] thing she said I can understand
[46:49] you I said would you mind writing that
[46:52] down where I can read it everybody says
[46:55] I'm some kind of an intellect
[46:57] seual he said well it wouldn't said I
[47:00] understood what you were talking
[47:02] about I thought okay that's good you
[47:05] know all right but
[47:10] listen God is the
[47:13] prophet even Jesus
[47:16] himself in the line of what he was
[47:20] doing he was born Lord the Christ the
[47:24] Messiah now he couldn't go and die for
[47:27] you right there right right 2 3 years
[47:31] old no no way all right you had to wait
[47:34] to a place to enter a Ministry and to
[47:36] bring forth the things and the River
[47:38] Jordan Etc and all of
[47:40] that
[47:42] now well then him being born Lord the
[47:47] Christ he could have prophesied at 2 or
[47:49] 3 years of age might have seen Visions
[47:53] at 2 or 3 years of AG brother around
[47:55] here but he didn't enter a prophetic
[47:58] Ministry form or style until the River
[48:01] Jordan
[48:03] right so then there was where he
[48:05] literally came into being as the son of
[48:09] man the
[48:13] prophet if You' ask Jesus are you the
[48:16] prophet he'd say God is the
[48:18] prophet I am a prophet I a man that God
[48:21] is using right brother random was not
[48:25] the prophet he was a prophet that's
[48:27] right it was a man that God was using to
[48:30] bring us to work if you make him the
[48:32] prophet he would be
[48:34] God so then you see how close you're
[48:37] going CU I know all the quotes I can
[48:38] quote with you anybody out there come on
[48:41] I know brother random would say about
[48:42] Moses said he was God to the people
[48:45] which you better quote that correctly he
[48:46] said while he's delivering his message
[48:48] but said when he stepped back he was
[48:50] Moses right so you better keep it
[48:53] straight I believe brother Brandon when
[48:55] he was speaking I believe that was
[48:56] almighty God voicing through a man when
[48:59] he said on marriage and divorce go home
[49:03] as you
[49:04] are everything I believe that was the
[49:06] voice of God
[49:10] right but that wouldn't brother R he
[49:12] couldn't say that until the holy spirit
[49:14] said to say
[49:15] it all right the prophet of the day is
[49:18] the holy spirit all right now let's get
[49:21] this in the right order so go ahead and
[49:22] pull up number seven on the notes
[49:25] brother this is take from questions and
[49:27] answers on the seals 1963
[49:31] 324 I love this quote cuz it ties
[49:34] together the entire Bible and thinking
[49:37] you see each one of those ages only take
[49:39] a dip took a dip only taken a dip into
[49:42] the Holy Spirit justification is a work
[49:44] of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a
[49:47] work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism
[49:49] is the holy spirit right now watch it
[49:52] that's the reason it took a prophetic
[49:54] Prophet to come down
[49:57] now see everybody reads that and say
[49:59] that's brother brand you you better read
[50:01] on I was
[50:03] listen that's the reason it took a
[50:05] prophetic Prophet to come down no
[50:07] Messenger to the age what he talking
[50:10] about zeusa street right because the
[50:13] Holy Ghost came himself in its fullness
[50:15] of the
[50:17] baptism that was on zeusa street but at
[50:20] the end of the age and it always ends
[50:22] upon the others we find there then the
[50:25] messenger sent
[50:27] there brother
[50:29] brown right and these Scruples and
[50:32] things were in a Rapture come for the
[50:34] church all no messenger of the age cuz
[50:38] the Holy Ghost came himself now the the
[50:41] oneeyed black man Seymour that his name
[50:44] daddy Seymour see right now even brother
[50:47] Brown said he was the messenger to the
[50:48] lady of CN now he called him that if you
[50:50] want that quote I'll be glad to find
[50:53] it but he said really was no messenger
[50:57] that's what he's explained there was no
[50:59] Messenger on the zeusa
[51:00] street you said but that was just gifts
[51:03] brother Dale that was the Holy Spirit
[51:08] right come on when they got all script
[51:11] that's not the holy spirit's problem
[51:13] that got all scrupled that wasn't him
[51:15] that made it scrupled come on it was the
[51:19] people right the Holy Spirit never
[51:21] brought the Scruples the Holy Spirit
[51:23] hadn't brought all the Scruples around
[51:24] this
[51:25] message that's right but yet everybody
[51:28] says the Holy Spirit or God told them
[51:31] this great Revelation I got you know
[51:35] well if it won't compare with the rest
[51:36] of the word what is it supposed to be if
[51:38] it won't say Hebrews
[51:44] 13:8 that he's the same yesterday today
[51:47] and
[51:48] forever then it cannot be of the spirit
[51:50] of God it must be that Antichrist Spirit
[51:52] we were talking about a while ago
[51:56] well you saying these people no I'm
[51:58] saying the spirit that's motivating
[52:02] them that's guiding people I'm not
[52:06] against
[52:08] people it's the spirit that's guiding
[52:11] them right look what he says now on
[52:14] this that's the reason it took a
[52:16] prophetic Prophet to come down no
[52:19] Messenger to the age because the Holy
[52:20] Ghost came himself in his fullness of
[52:22] the
[52:24] baptism he's talking about what let's do
[52:26] this Street go right back up read
[52:28] it but the baptism is the Holy Spirit
[52:31] you got justification you got
[52:33] sanctification and then you got isusa
[52:35] Street baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[52:37] right if you'd read sometimes about
[52:39] isusa Street I've tried to tell you many
[52:42] many people don't even think about it
[52:44] that was theusa Street was trinitarians
[52:47] that was not the Oneness Doctrine the
[52:49] Oneness Doctrine started about 1912
[52:51] somewhere in there and as it started
[52:53] they started throwing Rotten Tomatoes at
[52:55] them the ones who claim to be Aus the
[52:58] street
[53:01] Originals why because they didn't
[53:03] believe they were
[53:06] trinitarians right so if the Holy Spirit
[53:08] could call on fall on trinitarians and
[53:11] give them the new
[53:15] birth you say you can't do
[53:17] it I wish you hadn't said
[53:23] that I want to ask for a raise of Hands
[53:26] by ask how many here has the baptism of
[53:28] the Holy
[53:29] Spirit me and 90% of you got it before
[53:32] you come to the word or the message
[53:34] right so you better back off your
[53:39] statements right
[53:42] right but you
[53:44] see Luther's justification was a work of
[53:47] the holy spirit that was the new birth
[53:49] of their age brother Rand even calls
[53:51] Wesley sanctification New Birth of
[53:53] sanctification
[53:57] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost came
[53:58] on zeusa
[54:03] street he said come in his
[54:06] fullness you argue the point of
[54:10] what you know you say well that's what
[54:12] the messenger within I don't want that
[54:13] part well that's what I said the other
[54:15] day about marriage and divorce you want
[54:17] marriage and divorce the
[54:19] grace and you'll gladly hold on to that
[54:23] with all you can stand because you
[54:25] needed it but then when it comes to the
[54:26] rest of the message well I don't believe
[54:30] that well I wouldn't believe the
[54:32] marriage and divorce then
[54:35] right because if it's Antichrist what he
[54:37] taught in one
[54:39] place come on if he didn't teach it
[54:43] correctly and it would be Antichrist it
[54:45] would be Antichrist in the marriage and
[54:46] divorce Grace right come on that's
[54:49] sensible but you see that's where people
[54:53] are well now I've preached this to you
[54:55] before so it's not a new thing not a new
[54:57] doctorine
[54:59] idea that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:03] that came on isusa
[55:05] Street the prophet of God said I met
[55:08] people with the baptism of the Holy
[55:09] Ghost it was preaching way before he
[55:10] come on the scene he said with a baptism
[55:13] of the Holy Ghost just like on the day
[55:14] of
[55:17] Pentecost now you see where the trouble
[55:19] is at is what I've always tried to
[55:21] explain to
[55:23] you if you take the upper room
[55:25] experience
[55:26] experience of the
[55:29] 120 and say ausa street was a
[55:32] restoration of the upper room experience
[55:35] of the 120 that had the faith of the
[55:37] fathers you got a
[55:39] problem I'll agree with you there that's
[55:41] not
[55:44] correct but you see on the day of
[55:46] Pentecost there was two things happened
[55:48] the upper room fell on 120 that had been
[55:50] tutored for three and 1/2 years right
[55:56] that's why they could teach us to become
[55:58] into their ways of do it that's why
[56:00] novice was not chosen to write the
[56:03] word you know a baby a
[56:07] beginner
[56:09] right but then the scripture says that
[56:11] when you and I receive the holy spirit
[56:13] it's an
[56:14] Earnest
[56:17] right so then the 3,000
[56:22] outside 120 been tutored for three and
[56:25] 1/2 years
[56:29] but the 3,000 outside had only heard one
[56:31] sermon
[56:32] basically and they got born
[56:35] again there's your Holy Spirit in a new
[56:40] birth there's why a prophet could say of
[56:42] zeusa street was the baptism of the Holy
[56:45] Ghost we have it just like the book of
[56:53] Acts see because that's where it's
[56:55] written about out of the Holy Spirit
[56:58] coming in the book of Acts you said
[57:01] that's just your idea I've been through
[57:03] that don't worry about it don't it don't
[57:05] offend me for you to think that had a
[57:08] great great brother friend of mine at
[57:09] least I thought he was but that's what
[57:12] he told me one day he said you ain't
[57:13] nothing but a
[57:15] badst you have to been there to know
[57:18] what I talking about he said you just
[57:20] figured it out
[57:21] intellectually in other words you can
[57:23] calculate upper room and that's down
[57:25] here and then you can make a discourse
[57:26] to explain the difference in the two
[57:28] well you go ahead and do what you want
[57:29] do with it but let's hear your
[57:34] definition that's open to the public
[57:36] let's hear your definition ain't going
[57:38] to argue with you about it send me a
[57:43] note but listen
[57:45] church either the prophet's right or
[57:48] something's messed up somewh right
[57:52] now then let's read a few quotes what
[57:54] brother random says about this baptism
[57:57] of the Holy
[57:59] Spirit right and I want you to notice
[58:01] we'll be going early Ministry later
[58:04] Ministry early Ministry later Ministry
[58:07] so that you won't come up with the idea
[58:09] that he changed his mind after the
[58:12] opening of the
[58:15] seals but remember on the opening of the
[58:18] uh on the future home he said I've
[58:20] taught three processes from the
[58:21] beginning as a
[58:23] boy it's all right all solves a problem
[58:27] case ended go ahead to the next go ahead
[58:29] to number
[58:31] eight this taken 1954 8:14 the
[58:35] unconditional Covenant that God made
[58:36] with the people e44 what a beautiful
[58:40] picture of God making his Covenant with
[58:41] the church when Jesus Christ went to
[58:44] Calvary who was God
[58:46] Emmanuel God ripped him apart at Calvary
[58:49] toward the Covenant in two took the body
[58:52] up to his right hand and sent the Holy
[58:54] Ghost back on the church
[58:57] and The Same Spirit was on Jesus Christ
[59:02] is in the church today and the same holy
[59:06] ghost that was back there has to be the
[59:09] same Holy Ghost when we come together
[59:12] making Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[59:14] today and forever and today we have the
[59:17] same baptism that they had on Pentecost
[59:20] when our part of the Covenant was thr
[59:23] thrown back you believe iten
[59:27] he said we have the same
[59:33] baptism so now every how you want to
[59:35] take what I said about trying to help
[59:38] you understand the uh the existence or
[59:42] whatever took place on the day of
[59:43] Pentecost you can't deny the quote
[59:48] right and it's no good to say well I
[59:51] don't
[59:52] know there's no excuse for that that's
[59:56] right not in this day all
[59:59] right now watch these as we go along
[1:00:03] look at number nine
[1:00:05] a this was an added one to our
[1:00:11] today in the church age book there is a
[1:00:14] section that's when it starts in the
[1:00:16] samon church
[1:00:18] age um somewhere about page
[1:00:22] 13839 or something it says the holy
[1:00:25] spirit in ever AG
[1:00:28] then it starts talking about it so watch
[1:00:30] what he says this is this is page 143
[1:00:33] the Samaran Church age which is church
[1:00:35] age book all in every age and every age
[1:00:39] is the age of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:00:41] True
[1:00:43] Believer right never age is the age of
[1:00:47] the Holy Ghost for the True Believer
[1:00:48] okay so is the Holy Ghost in every
[1:00:51] age all right now I didn't give them
[1:00:53] this one to give to you but on the uh
[1:00:57] Taran Church age 1960 1204
[1:01:01] 1208 paragraph 73 brother Randon said in
[1:01:05] other words I've been studying it he's
[1:01:06] went through and he's talking about
[1:01:07] Methodist Baptist uh and all like that
[1:01:11] he says I've been days and days now
[1:01:15] those his histories digging them into
[1:01:19] all I can find
[1:01:21] everywhere and it's the flame of
[1:01:24] Pentecost that stayed alive from
[1:01:27] Pentecost down to this time yes sir it's
[1:01:31] been pushed
[1:01:33] out it was a holy spirit never aged
[1:01:36] right all right so that's what he's
[1:01:38] saying here now he goes into the
[1:01:41] evidence then those who had the spirit
[1:01:43] the teacher heard the word and that
[1:01:45] spirit in them took the word and taught
[1:01:47] it revealed it to them and there were
[1:01:50] the group that heard the message of his
[1:01:52] age and took it and lived it now if you
[1:01:55] go on reading through you'll see that
[1:01:56] he's telling you what that that group
[1:01:59] that Holy Spirit is the teacher that is
[1:02:01] the same evidence in never Church
[1:02:03] age every Church agent got the same
[1:02:06] evidence
[1:02:08] right what whether or not the spirit in
[1:02:11] you agrees with the word right right the
[1:02:15] teacher inside of you teaching you the
[1:02:16] word that's the evidence of the holy
[1:02:18] spirit all right now keep that in mind
[1:02:20] so all right on to number nine now which
[1:02:23] is U acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 1219
[1:02:28] paragraph
[1:02:30] 66 the same holy ghost that fell on the
[1:02:33] day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost
[1:02:35] of today I'll admit it's been tramped on
[1:02:38] made fun of
[1:02:40] misinterpreted misrepresented and
[1:02:43] everything else like that that's only
[1:02:45] the devil counterfeiting listen to it
[1:02:48] but there is a real genuine baptism of
[1:02:51] the holy spirit that brings the same
[1:02:53] results that they had on the day of
[1:02:55] Pentecost that's right and you say well
[1:02:58] where's your signs and
[1:03:00] wonders people that's what they'll say
[1:03:02] where's your signs and
[1:03:04] wonders
[1:03:06] well come up this
[1:03:09] church I invite you here you want to see
[1:03:13] where signs and wonders has been here or
[1:03:16] not and let's just let a few of these
[1:03:19] people that sitting here talk to
[1:03:21] you that's right not about little things
[1:03:25] that are

[1:03:28] third pool because somebody come along

[1:03:34] taxes well I'm just as honest as I'll
[1:03:37] ever be you go out here and go walking
[1:03:40] down through the city of Gainesville and
[1:03:42] you stay up there long enough and you'll
[1:03:44] find somebody that you can talk in to
[1:03:46] pay your taxes cuz you'll reach some
[1:03:49] heart that'll pay them for you is that
[1:03:51] the third pool now that's a sorry lazy
[1:03:53] bum it won't work
[1:03:57] problem

[1:04:28] here in a minute if I have time I want
[1:04:29] to read
[1:04:33] it would you see it's the Holy Spirit he
[1:04:35] said it's been trampled on right because
[1:04:37] people's misunderstood it they
[1:04:39] misinterpreted it you know they
[1:04:41] misrepresented theyve done all kind of
[1:04:43] things with it zeusa Street yes was a
[1:04:46] great example but the Holy Ghost it fell
[1:04:49] was the Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost that's right it was genuine it was
[1:04:52] real am they were the ones that made it
[1:04:56] speaking in tongues right they were the
[1:04:59] ones that made it those things but I've
[1:05:02] got a book at home that wait is his if

[1:08:15] immediately who was it Smith
[1:08:17] Wigglesworth that Wade was talking about
[1:08:19] the other day that seen 11 12 or 13
[1:08:22] people raised from the dead one man had
[1:08:25] already been
[1:08:29] inbombed one man had no legs and no
[1:08:33] feet and Smith I've read that in the
[1:08:35] history readon I knew when he was saying
[1:08:37] that I've read it in his own books I got
[1:08:39] it the
[1:08:42] house he told a man to go down and buy
[1:08:44] him a pair of shoes the man didn't
[1:08:46] believe it that much he just took him
[1:08:47] down there
[1:08:50] right told him give him a pair of shoes
[1:08:52] he didn't even have no feet
[1:08:55] right but when they set the shoes down
[1:08:58] the foot came
[1:09:01] down brother Mo said he was sitting when
[1:09:05] I may miss it my believe it was a
[1:09:08] alen I don't know about that but I know
[1:09:10] brother Mo told me that he was sitting
[1:09:12] in this this
[1:09:13] Minister a Pentecostal Minister and this
[1:09:16] man's leg was one shorter than the other
[1:09:19] well you know you can do that and fake
[1:09:20] it I okay brother Mo said when he said
[1:09:23] bow your head he said I didn't bow mine
[1:09:25] I wanted to see he said I sat there and
[1:09:27] looked and he said that leg grow out
[1:09:29] just straight As
[1:09:31] H those things were real Church those
[1:09:35] people believe God and great healings
[1:09:38] and signs and wonders took place that's
[1:09:41] get with dick brother dick there and
[1:09:42] talk about the method that's going over
[1:09:44] in the jungles over there and the people
[1:09:46] being raised from the
[1:09:51] dead but you see we don't want to
[1:09:54] believe
[1:09:58] we don't believe it's the same Holy
[1:09:59] Spirit go to the next
[1:10:04] one this would be the rejected
[1:10:10] King 196 610 paragraph
[1:10:15] 55 and the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:10:18] the day of Pentecost which we all know
[1:10:21] that that was the birth of the new
[1:10:23] church
[1:10:25] if that same Holy Spirit don't bring the
[1:10:28] same experience to you then you've got a
[1:10:32] different Holy Spirit than what that was
[1:10:35] that's as blun as can be right that's
[1:10:42] right exactly right if it don't make you
[1:10:45] live a sacrificial life and a and a life
[1:10:50] full of joy and
[1:10:52] pleasure and the baptism of the spirit
[1:10:54] leading you into signs and wonders and
[1:10:57] miracles and things there's something
[1:10:59] happened Jesus said these signs shall
[1:11:01] follow them same Holy Spirit go to the

[1:11:23] come through the blood and we've been
[1:11:26] saved been cleansed from our sins and
[1:11:28] the Holy Ghost fell brother Peter said
[1:11:30] on the day of Pentecost it is for you
[1:11:33] and for your children and for them
[1:11:35] that's far off even as many as the Lord
[1:11:38] Our God shall call and every person that
[1:11:41] enters into this baptism of the Holy
[1:11:43] Spirit can have the same kind of holy
[1:11:46] ghost that they got on the day of

[1:15:49] this Glory into a body like unto his own
[1:15:51] glorious body when we shall see him
[1:15:53] Abraham saw the son
[1:15:56] like there's two
[1:16:02] more
[1:16:03] 65919 a message called thirst paragraph
[1:16:07] 125 we got a living God not one that
[1:16:09] died 1900 years ago and stayed in the
[1:16:12] grave now listen to
[1:16:16] him see some people believe he was fine
[1:16:18] already up a few ages but then something
[1:16:23] happened well he's
[1:16:26] saying it is not one that died 1900
[1:16:28] years ago and stayed in the grave but
[1:16:31] one that raised again Hebrews 138 say
[1:16:33] he's this says he's the same yesterday
[1:16:35] today and forever the same holy ghost
[1:16:37] that fell on the day of Pentecost is the
[1:16:39] same Holy Ghost that's here now one more
[1:16:42] now these are not all that on these just
[1:16:45] some I chose to bring this drops
[1:16:47] backward then to show you 59405 it was
[1:16:50] not so from the beginning or E12 and
[1:16:53] then when someone said says that the
[1:16:55] word of God does not teach Divine
[1:16:57] Healing now listen they're saying
[1:17:00] something that the word does not
[1:17:03] say okay now
[1:17:05] what you amen that one now listen to
[1:17:08] this one and when they say the word does
[1:17:10] not teach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:12] for believers in all ages they are
[1:17:14] saying something that the word does not
[1:17:16] say they're substituting something to
[1:17:19] take its
[1:17:23] place oh I'm trying to get you to see
[1:17:25] tonight is one
[1:17:32] thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[1:17:35] been in every age that's right but it
[1:17:37] finishes in this
[1:17:39] age in the basis
[1:17:42] that it is to be a restoration of the
[1:17:46] original and in this age we are expected
[1:17:48] to come back to where the apostles were
[1:17:51] right and everybody that received the
[1:17:54] new birth of other than the 120 in the
[1:17:56] upper room received it as a baby
[1:18:00] Earnest right brother brandom received
[1:18:03] it as a baby as an Earnest oh no he was
[1:18:06] a prophet that don't have anything to do
[1:18:08] with a new
[1:18:09] birth bam was a prophet and never got
[1:18:13] it never had it
[1:18:16] right right anointed ones at the end
[1:18:19] time can be anointed on their
[1:18:23] Spirit right
[1:18:25] amen right not be born again right great
[1:18:30] signs and wonders can take
[1:18:33] place but
[1:18:37] listen if we don't have the new birth
[1:18:40] like they had in the upper room I mean
[1:18:42] in the uh the 3000 will'll never come to
[1:18:45] the upper room
[1:18:47] experience cuz that's the
[1:18:49] adoption that's adding to your faith
[1:18:52] virtue that's what Peter was doing Peter
[1:18:54] knew the people people that were being
[1:18:55] birthed under him were
[1:18:58] babies that's why Paul spent two two
[1:19:01] whole books First Corinthians 2
[1:19:03] Corinthians
[1:19:05] correcting little babies he never said
[1:19:08] he wouldn't born
[1:19:11] again but they were
[1:19:14] babies he said Desiring the sincere milk
[1:19:17] of the word as Peter would
[1:19:19] say if you're born again you're born
[1:19:22] again as a baby you're not born again at
[1:19:23] the top of the pyramid
[1:19:26] right you're born again as a baby that's
[1:19:29] where the trouble people don't like for
[1:19:30] me in the way I preach it say bless God
[1:19:33] when I got it like I told you one
[1:19:34] brother told me one time said when I got
[1:19:36] the baptism of Holy Ghost I was adopted
[1:19:39] manifested son of God right
[1:19:43] there I don't agree with
[1:19:48] you I didn't get mad at him I didn't
[1:19:52] come preach far as I AC to
[1:19:57] I get mad
[1:19:58] at other brother said that we didn't
[1:20:01] have nothing just had an anointing I
[1:20:04] didn't get mad at him I had him to come
[1:20:06] preach for me it's kind of hard I Ain
[1:20:08] never preached to any one of their
[1:20:09] churches that's all
[1:20:13] right but you see I still let them come
[1:20:16] preach Butz I thought you were good
[1:20:20] Brothers but just remember you're not
[1:20:22] born again by the new bir birth you know
[1:20:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new
[1:20:26] birth coming into the body of Christ
[1:20:28] that don't positionally put you at The
[1:20:29] Headstone just because you're born in
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:33] age
[1:20:36] M no it gives you the new
[1:20:40] birth the mind of Christ as a baby form
[1:20:44] and then we must be taught how to come
[1:20:46] up the stature of a perfect man that's
[1:20:49] right and to come out where the apostles
[1:20:52] were
[1:20:54] then we can talk about the seals the
[1:20:57] Daniel 70 weeks the things
[1:21:00] that the prophet brought to
[1:21:03] us and see that it's not an addition as
[1:21:06] I started off talking to the Bible it's
[1:21:10] just an unfolding of the truth that was
[1:21:13] laying
[1:21:14] there that light had never shined on
[1:21:17] those things in the
[1:21:19] word wasn't something
[1:21:22] added we don't believe in
[1:21:30] Revelation but if we don't have the new
[1:21:32] birth tonight it's not God's fault cuz
[1:21:36] he's made it known unto us that's right
[1:21:39] yes but brother Dale how am I going to
[1:21:40] do because I've confessed all these
[1:21:43] years that I was born again I did
[1:21:46] too for 10 years in the Baptist Church
[1:21:49] become a deacon at 23 years
[1:21:51] old taught all the Sunday School glasses
[1:21:54] and
[1:21:59] everything but when I come in this
[1:22:01] message I saw I didn't have the new
[1:22:03] birth well how did you see it because
[1:22:07] the man that was talking about the Life
[1:22:09] of
[1:22:11] Christ the supernatural God was not
[1:22:14] talking about an intellectual conception
[1:22:17] or a thought that we
[1:22:22] had maybe that's why he let me me see
[1:22:24] him when I was about 11 years old where
[1:22:26] I realize there was something
[1:22:27] Supernatural about
[1:22:31] God but I don't claim that to be my new
[1:22:36] birth when I come in this message I said
[1:22:38] I don't have the new
[1:22:43] birth I got baptized I got straightened
[1:22:46] up and all of that what little bit I had
[1:22:48] to get rid of I tried to get rid of it
[1:22:51] still am trying to get rid of it
[1:22:55] lot of things we didn't have to get rid
[1:22:56] of we just we were already controlling
[1:22:59] our kids in the Baptist Church we left
[1:23:02] there in 57 we were already controlling
[1:23:05] what our kids watched on
[1:23:11] TV before we come in this
[1:23:16] message tried to walk in the light of
[1:23:18] the love of God but I knew I didn't have
[1:23:22] the new birth so i s out I started seing
[1:23:24] for seeking for
[1:23:28] God people told me said what do you mean
[1:23:31] you had to you you was led to the
[1:23:33] message had to be the Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost the Holy Ghost LED Judas
[1:23:39] too the Holy Ghost gave Judas a Ministry
[1:23:43] to raise the dead and heal the sick and
[1:23:45] cast out Devils that's
[1:23:52] right make your calling an election
[1:23:55] sure do you have the new birth the
[1:23:58] prophet said that's the most important
[1:24:00] thing in the
[1:24:01] world if whether or not you're born
[1:24:04] again
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:09] right what a Val it
[1:24:11] Church well I don't really know whether
[1:24:13] I'm born again or not we don't stop
[1:24:15] seeking God then right
[1:24:19] amen well if I said if I if I didn't
[1:24:22] confess I got it you just said want to
[1:24:24] go I got a confession that's exactly
[1:24:26] right go confess
[1:24:31] it but remember there's a difference in
[1:24:33] a confession and a possession that's
[1:24:37] right confess it until it becomes a
[1:24:40] possession and you don't have to worry
[1:24:42] about it then
[1:24:44] right it'll be a
[1:24:50] reality what about it a special class
[1:24:55] people God chose us in the end time to
[1:24:59] finish up the
[1:25:00] work that he gave for us to
[1:25:03] do R said he didn't finish all of what
[1:25:05] he came to do he said he allow left that
[1:25:08] for the bride what that quote left that
[1:25:11] for you and I to
[1:25:14] finish we got to
[1:25:17] conquer get away from that conquering
[1:25:19] Spirit has tried to conquer us you know
[1:25:21] conquer the leoty we got to get out m
[1:25:24] that
[1:25:26] right we got to get into the
[1:25:29] word and eat that word until we become
[1:25:32] the word
[1:25:35] right I've never said I had all the
[1:25:37] answers but I tell I've always said I
[1:25:39] know where to go get
[1:25:48] them what about
[1:25:50] it a prophetic people the prophet said
[1:25:55] one with
[1:25:57] supernatural abilities to
[1:26:02] understand what else could you
[1:26:04] want I want to see this and I want to
[1:26:07] see that that's that's
[1:26:09] good but you can't see that until you
[1:26:12] believe it and get born
[1:26:17] again now I know this is going to been a
[1:26:20] very offensive statement and I'm sorry I
[1:26:22] have to make
[1:26:25] if I have the Holy Spirit I cannot deny
[1:26:28] the word
[1:26:31] right right if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:26:35] out on the internets or anybody that
[1:26:36] ever hear this or whatever if you have
[1:26:38] the Holy Spirit you cannot deny the
[1:26:40] word amen right it don't make us
[1:26:44] automatic Giants to where we know
[1:26:46] everything no it just makes us the
[1:26:49] children of
[1:26:50] God I love to watch these little kids
[1:26:54] as they grow
[1:26:56] up and watch
[1:26:59] them and knowing that you think they're
[1:27:02] sound asleep you think they don't know
[1:27:04] what in the world's going on you just
[1:27:07] say something
[1:27:09] contrary and watch him cor
[1:27:14] you and tell you what the truth
[1:27:18] is abig Grace can still tell you the day
[1:27:22] that Matthew and she's about 2 years old
[1:27:24] or somewhere close to three but Matthew
[1:27:27] Ronnie
[1:27:28] Redlight in where I guess was down in
[1:27:31] Augusta was somewhere she'll tell you
[1:27:33] today that Matthew run that red
[1:27:37] light cuz she saw
[1:27:40] it but then I told you she told her
[1:27:42] nanny the other day to quit confessing
[1:27:46] wrong that was wrong for her to say she
[1:27:48] wouldn't
[1:27:52] healed 5 years old now
[1:27:56] these children are a whole lot smarter
[1:27:58] than you
[1:28:01] think they know a whole lot more than
[1:28:03] you think they
[1:28:06] know
[1:28:10] right if you don't think they don't you
[1:28:12] just don't think they know a lot then
[1:28:14] the next time that Josiah asks some
[1:28:16] questions I'm going to give them to
[1:28:20] you all right I'll let you have them
[1:28:24] you'll be responsible for that
[1:28:29] answer that if Jesus created Mary how
[1:28:32] could Mary be his
[1:28:34] mother that was a question he asked what
[1:28:37] 5 years ago four years ago or something
[1:28:40] been a while
[1:28:42] back good
[1:28:48] question and you know that these little
[1:28:51] children can receive the baptism of the
[1:28:53] Holy Ghost yes when they reach that age
[1:28:56] of
[1:28:58] accountability and that's so adults can
[1:29:00] deny and walk off the away
[1:29:04] from they can be the children of
[1:29:09] God think on these things come
[1:29:12] on think on these things a special class
[1:29:15] of
[1:29:17] people chosen especially for this end
[1:29:21] time God knowing that he would need a
[1:29:24] group of
[1:29:25] people that wouldn't fall for all of
[1:29:28] these
[1:29:28] things wouldn't go after all of these
[1:29:31] doctrines and ideas and
[1:29:34] opinions and they would just be simple
[1:29:38] enough to say the prophet said it and I
[1:29:42] believed
[1:29:47] it would be that
[1:29:50] simple to do those things let's Stand

[1:35:08] if we don't have the new birth we can't
[1:35:11] understand God right and if it's not the
[1:35:14] same holy
[1:35:16] spirit that was original from the day of
[1:35:19] Pentecost then what would it
[1:35:22] be it wasn't the holy spirit that was
[1:35:24] eat away it was the word that went down
[1:35:27] because he killed off all of the
[1:35:28] Believers and you took away the the
[1:35:31] things and started up with the nicolan
[1:35:33] doctrines and drove out the original
[1:35:36] until they finally just took the Bible
[1:35:37] away from the
[1:35:42] people but still there was people that
[1:35:44] received the new
[1:35:46] birth and gave their lives for what they
[1:35:51] believed Martin Luther says
[1:35:54] I can't recant for what I've wrote what
[1:35:57] I've
[1:35:58] said said because it would be denying
[1:36:01] what I
[1:36:05] am he
[1:36:08] threatened excommunication threaten with
[1:36:10] killings and everything but he still
[1:36:12] couldn't
[1:36:14] change and to them the excommunication
[1:36:17] from the Catholic Church meant that he
[1:36:19] was lost could never be saved he was
[1:36:22] eternally doomed
[1:36:24] but yet he put everything he had on
[1:36:27] there and said the just shall live by
[1:36:31] faith it's a personal
[1:36:35] revelation not a group therapy it's a
