========================================

amen and amen amen you want to see him well then he'll be there for you you want to see him good to be in the house of the lord we're glad to have our visitor with us and we say welcome i think she's been here before though so we just count you one of us so forget it just make yourself at home but we're glad to have you with us anyway and uh we had a good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting i think it was about uh 12 of us there and we had a good time over and back good safe and all it was real good uh remember by way of announcements brother jewel forney will be with us on the 30th of this month which is on a wednesday and then brother quinn will be with us on august the 11th and brother danny del mundo however he pronounced it from the philippines will be with us on the 18th of

the things you've done in the helping and the fixing of the food and doing all other things it was it was really good and they they really appreciate it said dear church family we used to express our gratitude for your support the beautiful flowers the cards the wonderful food served to our family and most of all your prayers during the loss of our dad your presence at the time of visitations and funeral services was also deeply appreciated as we know a lot of you have a distance to drive we feel dad was a very special man and we agree with that and it's a great comfort to know so many people miss him dearly we are so grateful to be part of this church family may you be blessed for the love and kindness you have shown to our family we love you all the family of brother george canada amen we really you know we really do appreciate the family and appreciate it brother george and all of the years that he served the lord and was there you know and was here with us and serving god all of his life's a great great opportunity to be able to been part of the services and so if you'd like turn in your scriptures i think that's at all announcements which only missed something but uh if you want to turn in your scriptures turn to romans 4. now we've been on romans 7 quite a while we dropped back this past uh weekend on the service there and started in romans 4 and then we'll go to psalms 32 but what we're going to do now is that message i didn't realize when i preached it i was just trying to bring in some some messages and thoughts uh maybe not a series but uh i believe it'll develop into a series so we'll just go as we're led to go you know try to speak on it but if you you know would like read um well we've been through the invisible union and all but i would ask you and you'll see in a minute why but i would ask you to really read matthew 5 on the beatitudes and we'll notice the difference of it in a moment but uh romans 4 and psalms 32 okay heavenly father we thank you for all that you've given unto us thank you for the day and the hour that we have thank you for your love and to us lord thank you for grace and all things thank you for strength and love and joy that we have and father that we can walk in you and see the the things unfold before us that are promised unto us and we believe you lord just have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in you we love you and we thank you and just have your way now touch the sick because you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we thank you we really truly believe the promises and we hold on to those promises because you said they're yea and amen and what a wonderful thing to be able to receive from you we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen romans 4 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he had whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted unto counted for righteousness remember james and paul is not contrary paul looks like he's saying it's all by faith no works james looks like he says it's all works no faith but that would be a contradiction in your scripture so james is explaining what the world is looking at or mankind and seeing it see and paul is explaining what god is looking at so then it's a wonderful story you know to see it but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describes the blessedness of the man and to whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin all right let's go back now to where that is in psalms it is referring to so it's psalm 132 excuse me 32 saying blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and whose spirit there is no guile when i kept silence my bones whacked o through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me the moisture is turned into the drought of summer sila i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquities have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sins see light you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i want you to pay close attention to the reading of the scriptures i believe that we need to and compare things and and you know and remember david is here in the old testament under the understanding of god in his ways and he's speaking of blessed the man whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered but then when you get over to paul he's over speaking at it from a situation of looking in god's mind and seeing it and he's seeing then that it is not just covered but it becomes annihilated all right so now you've got to cover both of them we'll try to get back to that scripture but you will see uh why i'm saying that as we go along because we we've tried to cover this past sunday about this scripture you know blessed is a man to whom god will not impute sin and i want to make sure you understand this because as i said it's a background now and what i do with a background is i lay down a situation or an existence from something to where that when it comes down to a later time then you can just look back and say you remember that or you uh i'd use it a lot of times to lay it down in a basis that when something is said your mind shouldn't be wondering running about and thinking well i think this is this i think this is that we've already been through the situation because that's what i do with a background is i lay it down to where that uh to me now there is no question but now that will not take away from man's mind or your thoughts but i'm trying to show you what i do in other words if i lay down a situation to you that there's just one true and living god there's never been but one god there's only one god there's no way there could be any other god well then i read a scripture about you know in another message and i'm talking about it and i come up and i read a scripture it said the god and father of our lord jesus christ bless you all god and father lord jesus christ how many we got well see if i didn't approach it the way i do you would question that point you know but with the point in mind i can refer back to you remember the message don't run your mind loose you know don't just take in your thoughts and try to interpret something we've already covered that there's just one true and living god you know but see i know that's what human i know that's the human capacity of mine because mine does the same thing but i'm just trying to get you to to pull away from that into thinking and then read the scriptures that can't be contradictory as i'm saying to start with about paul looks like he's laying it down that man is truly saved just by faith alone you know and then james comes along and says no now you show me your faith by your works well you know both of them is exactly right the point is we just didn't have them together paul is describing the way god looks at a thing james is describing the way mankind looks at a thing and and it's not a contradictory but yet we've argued that's been argued amongst organized religion you know probably ever since it was written i guess but now watch these today and keep your foundation correctly you remember last week when we were covering that david truly saw the grace of god because look at the things he'd done you know and was even supposed to been killed for taking you rise wife and things like that and if it hadn't been for the prophet that was bringing forth the mind of god into being they would have killed david but yet the prophet said i've prayed for you and god won't take your life but said he's going to take the child like the brother was bringing out last night about the scripture you know uh you know they're in and trying to show that you're gonna read what you sow i had it written in my bible i got it written on the side of that scripture brother brandon said that's not talking about salvation when you read reap what you sow is not talking about salvation it's talking about natural life it's talking about the existence of what we are see because we do then reap what we sow it's not something to say whether you're going to heaven or not amen but we're going to reap what we sow because if we don't get rid of what we do we're going to have to answer somewhere and see you say but yeah but you brother dale you just don't preach grace and things like other people i i can hear them preaching and i just feel so wonderful blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin yeah and then you just go out and live like the devil you're showing you don't understand the scripture see that's what the psalmist is doing david is saying blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered all right blessed is the man unto whom god imputeth not iniquity in whom spirit there is no god now you say well boy he's saying that man i'm so special a person you know i'm i'm a great person god won't count this to me because i'm just so great what did we cover last week god was looking at an honest and a contrite heart david at least had that much he had a repentant attitude and an honest heart that's what god was looking at when we get to the end of the message this evening i mean this morning uh the lord willing you'll see it but see if you think well well david is just saying that there's a person that you know just nothing can never be counted against them you know which is so great well why did he go in verse five i'm gonna pull that back up brother anderson for us why did he say this in verse five if you're thinking that he's just saying it's okey-dokey all i've done is okey-dokey everything's fine i'm just not god just don't count nothing to me i'm so great why did he say verse 5. he gets down to verse 5 and he says i acknowledge my sin unto thee now if he didn't have any why's he acknowledging it you mean he's admitting he's a sinner when god tells him he's not a sinner no he's honest he was a sinner i acknowledge my sin unto thee in my iniquity have i not hid where do we get down in the scripture right the lies may take on this evening but where the bible said if you say you don't have no sin oh you're a liar we get that up front you're a liar but i just don't like your way appreciate it because i don't have you know go ahead he said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgive us the iniquity of my sin now if he's so much covered why would david be talking about acknowledging his sin see that's why people do that and they say well it don't matter what i do i'm saved you got a point but if we go out and live like the devil that proves we're not saved so that's on the other side of it right see i like to take everything and look at it in one perspective and knowing that the bible can't be contradictory that it shows the truth but yet sometimes we have to get it together for it to be revealed if not we can just do anything we want to and whatever like i said the other day we said where the bible said if your heart condemn you not i ain't gonna let my heart condemn me what did the prophet say about it did you got no more conscience and the snake's got hips you seared yourself away from the truth and yet you'll sat there i'm led of god and then you'll say well look what god does in my life i'm blessed you don't mean a thing when you're if you're blessed and you don't follow the word don't mean a thing that means you're a very deceived person if the word tells me not to do something then i said well the lord told me it's okay for me to go do it wasn't that what tammy face at that time timmy faye baker remember her might not recall the names but that she said it she said i asked the lord if it was wrong for me to paint my face sometime and said he didn't answer me so it was okay how carnal can we be where we propped up things all right but now think about it what's the difference in the reading we're going to read some scriptures but we're not going back into the beatitudes i hope you'll go back there and read it but in the beatitudes matthew 5 it will say blessed are the pure in heart blessed are this blessed you know blessing all right now some people say blessed and some of us just carnal enough to say blessed but that's all right which one it is you read the scripture but now i want you to notice that the scripture says blessed is the man there that we read in the psalmist now blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god that can be a future event that can be pointing forward backward or whatever you know right that's why i want you to read the beat attitudes i like what brother moat used to say about that he said that's that's be your attitude so that was a good point but i want you to notice the scripture says blessed is the man present tense when we come up to a new testament thought and dealing with it we're not supposed to be dealing with it just as a you know a thought but as a present tense he that saith that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god he is come into flesh now not just back there two thousand years ago but now because is is bringing something down to now where we're at all right let's just read a few scriptures on this and then we'll get to our thoughts go ahead and pull up let's read some scriptures and just just see blessed is the man psalms 1 1 that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly or stand it in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful i want you to notice as we read and then we'll get down to the bottom one and bring it together but i want you to notice that it's like david as i said david is saying seemingly blessed is the man to whom looks like god won't even impute sin or anything and then turns right around and says i acknowledge my sin now as i said if if it's so eradicated and we want to try to make it from that point why is he acknowledging his sin see david is what paul is speaking of david is looking at it as from a repentant heart all right and if i repent god will forgive me right in that scripture no i won't say what is it blessed is a man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor stand it's in the way of the sinners are sitteth in the sea that's going for psalm 65 and 4 blessed is the man whom and blessed is the man of whom thou choose us something new with choosing and cause us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of thy holy temple let's keep rolling up 80 psalms 84 and verse 5 blessed is the man whose strength is in thee and whose heart are the ways of them a connection to an honest and a contrite heart that's what i want you to do with the scriptures get the connection of how that he's pouring out his heart to god and god is hearing that and saying he's blessed because when he's saying blessed to start see he's saying what god says but then when he gets down to the other party he's saying what he is blessed god is saying blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them psalms 84 and 12 o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusts us in thee psalms 94 and 12 blessed is the man whom thou chasteneth o lord and teaches him out of thy law that's why i love the scriptures over in the corinthians for the communion god will chasten us right all right go ahead psalms 112 and verse 1 praise you the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments all right proverbs 8 and 34 blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the post of my doors isaiah 65 1 and 2 thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed what now blessed is the man that doeth this what that keeps his judgments that realize justice realizes salvation is near this is the man that doeth this and the son of man that left hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keeps his hands from doing evil jeremiah 17 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is james 1 verse 12 blessed is the man that endure temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him right now we're back to the psalms that we read 132 i mean 32 1-5 a psalm of david michelle everybody pronounce that blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered now remember in the old testament sin was only covered there was nothing to take it away and brother harris used to use the word and preach the message on it one time called it capo it means it's covered all right now blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputed not iniquity why it's covered and whose spirit there is no guile why because it's covered right and when i keep silent my bones wax you know old am i roaring all day long for the day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of the summer see in other words if if when i keep silence the bible says it's like a you know it shut up in your bones all right then when he's saying in day and night my hand was heavy upon me why was god's hand heavy upon him if everything was so perfect and clear see why would we think that why would we think that well it's okay for me to go do wrong because i'm saved anyway i didn't believe that in the baptist church and i stayed there a long time but i didn't believe it look then he says i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have i not hid. i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin see then you can see real quickly that this is not talking about just well it's okay to go do anything even the psalmist david using the biggest portion of the scriptures from the old testament form and to show that it's just covered see those old testament saints never had the new birth all right now as you'll see when i'm going along then david is really speaking of someone in the new testament because he's acknowledging his sins and admitting that they're covered right so david is not just saying well it's okay for me to go do like i want to because i'm saved anyway david's not saying that neither is paul saying anything about it like that he's saying like exactly what it is the truth if we think we don't have to worry about the way we live even if it now listen listen everybody listening even if that would be true that it didn't make no difference whatsoever why would you want to live that before others to let them think it's okay for them to do it why would it even be in considered in our mind of a thought that it doesn't make no difference what we do we're saved anyway what are we doing with it we're taking somebody's idea like i said life's not coming home we're talking about you know and you take it to the point that you don't have any sin you don't have any condemnation you better be checking to see whether you're saved or not why would not we want to be concerned oh we're in the new testament where it just don't make no difference though because god even said to david blessed of the man to whom god will not impute sin that's what i'm saying when paul picked it up he's looking through the mind of god david never said it like that david said my sins are covered i will acknowledge them but they're only covered they cannot be done away because that old testament saint could not have the new birth because jesus christ had not come and died yet that's right all right let's just read a few things i had these the other day and i went through a little of it but i want to make sure you get this thought of what i'm trying to bring i believe it has said that david experienced the love of god to set him free when even he called down judgment upon himself said let the man that's done this come and i'll kill him the prophet said david you're the man it wasn't repentance from david that he got caught up with that's what most people's repentance is you know no saying talk is cheap they say oh i'm sorry you know but what about an honest and a contrad heart that cries out to god now don't you think that the rest of david's life he thought about what he done and don't you realize that he spent the rest of his life preparing to build a temple that he would never build because he'd done been told he doesn't shed too much blood things was going on it wasn't too much blood that he battled the enemies god told him to go kill the enemies come on the blood was the thing that he done to cover his sin and he had a man killed here to cover his sin see then they think about it look what the prophet has to say here on the way number 12 i think it is which is believeth out of this 1951 1003. he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll pray the father and he sends you another comforter which is the holy spirit and he will abide with you all right why do we need a comforter if we don't have wrong why do we need an advocate if we don't do wrong look what he goes on to say so what kind of a people should we be then why we should be free and happy in my no condemnation living above sin and disgrace not by our own but by him see not what we are but what he is god don't accept me for what i am he accepts me for what christ has done for me right it isn't my holiness my righteousness it's his i have none to offer but i just accepted his amen so i know he's pleased with that listen for he said blessed is my beloved no i'm just saying it anyway this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased that's talking about you he said no no not talking about him on him that's talking about you up here you know when god gave you the baptism of the holy ghost he said blessed he said you're blessed he gave you that holy ghost he said he was pleased to dwell in him right well no no that was just about jesus well okay see i believe that david was pointing toward the people who would receive the new birth i believe i've proved my point by the scriptures that if not then why would he be acknowledging in his sin he was pointing toward the new birth to a group of people that would receive jesus christ into their life and would put them into a position that david realized he was not in right all right pointing down to we think a special people that's why i just read this quote are we a special people are we some kind of great one bless god god wouldn't save me if i hadn't been like i was see one side says it this way i was so good god saved me the other side said i was so bad god save me neither one of them's right what do you see why i read this quote it's not looking at a special people it's looking at what god has made us remember brother collins always bore with me years ago we spoke on he's talking about it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we're not anything special but there's one thing about it if the old testament was the apple of his eye right what does he think about the new testament sons and daughters he thinks a lot about us but yet is that supposed to make us the word that we can say well that don't matter you know oh dodea granddaddy it don't matter about but oh granddaddy he'll just take care of everything for us he's a dodea granddaddy well i'll do the best i can but it's not based on that way you see god looks at our heart today as well as he looked at the heart of david all right see it's what christ has done has made us a special people that god loves us because we desired to love him no he just picked out well that's what we think see no brother said god don't predestinate by his desires he said because he desired it everybody be saved but listen look what he says now talking about the new birth and remembering if it was so much that a man under the blood of bulls and goats could cry out for repentance that god would take that person and cover them right waiting until calvary where he could eradicate that sin right but yet he would cover them go bail them and say look what they're doing like just don't see a thing amen said they failed balaam fell to see the sacrifice the brazen altar the things that was keeping israel covered right blood atonement once a year to cover them to keep them from being killed for their sin regular atonement were made daily for things that was you know in life to be done but once a year they made an atonement it covered all israel you know what it even covered the bad ones because god didn't kill them remember the mixed multitude the bible speaks out they were the ones that caused all the trouble with israel yet god didn't destroy him he honored that he covered him you say well if he done that for them then i don't have to worry about it if you got that attitude you better start worrying about it that's just the best way to say it because if you try to have an attitude that there's no repentance needed then you got the wrong attitude even under the blood of bulls and goats they had the right attitude there was a repentance what should we be in the new birth yeah but brotherdale i just thought it made us so great well if it did it's what he done we don't have anything to do with it all right look what he said on the token message in 1964 308 now the promises makes free from sin shows that god hasn't hasn't recognized your sin watch david said blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin too now watch it and god will never impute sin over that token amen now the tokens are baptism of the holy ghost to the believer right come on he'll never impute sin over that token because the token is the paid sign that god has already received it remember the is the is the is instead of our all of the blessed is blessed is and you got the token part your faith has brought it and you have the purchase price of your redemption in your body to worship him and so forth his promises and power all right now if he gave you the new birth there's no way he can take it back do you need those quotes that god is not an indian giver to give it to you and then take it back away from you if he gave you the new birth then he's saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell talking about you seeing that that token has been applied and if israel under the blood of bulls and goats the heifer that was given as the one atonement that god would not eradicate them right they were his people how much more would be the blood of jesus christ in the new birth so then i'm a firm believer in one thing you can't sin enough to be lost if you're born again but then who would want to go sin right does that give you a right just live like the devil now if you live like the devil you're the devil no problems right other people preach about grace and i just feel so good i just oh i just bubble well why is it the next day you're down at the mouth i thought the word was going to set us free i thought that's what we talked in the scripture about you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free but see it's not what we do it's what he's already done now remember if he couldn't destroy israel under a covering of the blood how much more is it in the new testament when he looks through red that red sees white but yet for us to think that we could go do what we desire to do and live of life of sin then we prove that we're lost that shouldn't be any problem he said brother dale are you telling me that i'm lost i'm telling you according to james right now according to james we have a right to look at what people do and don't do that was why he was putting that there that's why we started off there last week on what there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus romans 8 1 who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so then there's condemnation to those that walk after the flesh or you don't have no more consciousness in the snakes got hips this is a background for something i want to speak on so it's been a question in a lot of your minds and it stays in my mind all the time too i have an odd way of approaching it so just bear with me but remember when i get up there and say this i'll say you amend this one all right so better be old me all right now listen what it means to be this person go to a number 14. look what it means to be this person that david is speaking of that paul is speaking up from the message the seat of discrepancy 65 118 paragraph 27 28 we find out god gave his children his word for their defense we have no defense no other defense defense than the word of god there's our defense brother random said if you can find it in the word he said you can call god on the scene and say if you don't bring it forth you are a liar now that was a strong one for me you mean you're gonna tell god he's a liar no you don't have to because you ain't gonna have opportunity no bomb shelters no nothing we don't worry about that look not even sin is imputed what to a genuine believer why if it is that the the sin couldn't be imputed under the old testament because it was covered by the blood why would it not be in the new testament that there'd be no sin with nobody come on are you thinking and there is no sin in the new testament we make ourselves sinners there is no sin a sinner is not condemned today he's going to get a judgment day why because god's not looking at it like we look at it right not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer did you know that he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot sin see it's not even imputed why david said blessed is the man who god will not impute sin when you're in christ you have no desire to sin the worst person were once purged has no more conscience of sin you don't desire it to the world you're a sinner and everything how can you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one and god only sees him who you are in so then there's not even sin to the world see we look around look at that box of centers we've got some quotes when we get in here sinners don't sin right boy well right they're just sinners that's right and you go around condemning people for doing what they're supposed to do and may i make it plainer we condemn them for doing what they're supposed to do that we used to do but we don't want that brought up right we don't want that bro now yet we're real bad to condemn everybody else and like i always say to you you know people will say well brother dale i don't see why people can't see it because i've seen it immediately and i remember it took me about six or eight months maybe a year to get you to see it but you saw it immediately sorry too 73 year old but i still got a good memory sometimes i wish i could forget but if you're in christ there's no way to commute impute sin to christ can you say he's a sinner no because he can't be imputed if you're born again christian look what he said on the token 1963 903 the morning service paragraph 333 334 he talked about a super super super super life that was in him comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and the things of the world a church member see that's what we used to be a denominational gore to what to a born-again christian filled with the spirit the life of god just flowing from you like sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness and there's the holy spirit moving speaking oh my there you are and with the what hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the blessed assurance of past from death unto life note therefore no condemnation at all hearing the message now if a prophet i don't understand about a lot of people's thoughts if a prophet like there who was it was it nathan that come to david and said you won't die uh he said could i pray for you you know what i i'm glad to hear the prayers of the prophet a lot of times what about you when i realize he's praying for me prophet's words before god got a lot of of uh bearing as we'd call it or whatever you know but see i don't i don't see why we can't consider though that that our prayers are also before god and there's a lot of bearing that goes with the the prior is it earnest sincere or how you say prayer of a righteous man availeth much why can't we believe that god hears our prayers pray for your children but look how bad they're doing that means you've got more to pray for that's when you want to pray harder amen amen right well let them get straightened up and then everything will be all right well you you're not even a parent let alone anything else let alone a christian you're not even a human being that's that's worth thinking let them come and say to they're sorry to me then i'll i'll pray for them now that's a very poor human being can i put it that away but now listen no condemnation the bible says to them that are in christ jesus all right now i have a lot of quotes here about the things that the prophet has said well let's just bypass a little of it and get down to our thought because we're trying to bring it if you're a christian a born-again christian you're under the blood of jesus christ all right but why would we trample on the blood of christ in any form whatsoever to think it's all right and we don't need to repent according to my bible i think we talk about it as being you know there in the scripture word about speaking the word and and it says first to be repentant well brother devil you mean yeah i believe brother branham was a very very very repentant person now according to him and what he said one day he said he lived so close to god until it forced that gift to work now do you need that quote in other words he prayed he fasted he stayed before the lord now he said he'd never fasted over three days in his life but a lot of people don't understand about him they think he fasted 40 he says no such thing in the bible it's a 40-day fast the lord jesus was the only one that went with a 40-day fast but he said he would fast like one meal you know et cetera then he was coming up to a meeting you know getting ready he would fast a few days but he said i never fasted over three days my life see fasting is to get yourself out of the way and in doing that then he would pray before god and god would hear him all right well see we think that's only for him why why yeah but the lord tells me something lord told me years ago why he was coming back that made me pray harder than ever then when he told me one day he was going to be standing in the pulpit with me preaching that really did make me pray it still makes me pray amen i don't know what he's got to go through with but you see we just take things too haphazardly and a lot of the quotes that i've got here that you're under the blood that your attorney is not only your attorney but he's your judge not only that but christians deal only as spiritual things we're not supposed to be dealing with natural and all of these is blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin but i hope i've laid down enough to get to this point because this is the hardest thing seemingly to explain the christian sin and if they do how do they do it or what does it or what goes wrong now if i asked a blanket question across to you right now and i say what is sin what are you going to say unbelief right now i've tried my best for 40 years to explain this i've been condemned of every form and thoughts of it people saying well what are you trying to explain body spirit and soul we're just a unit that's true we're a unit called body spirit and soul but what are you trying to say we're just a unit are you saying the whole unit does wrong that's why we get back into more scripture but according to the little john's it says that his seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin amen does that mean i can't sin when the prophet says we sin every day and what are you going to do with it if you think paul and and james sounds contradictory what are you going to do with the bible telling you that you're a sinner and if you don't admit you're a sinner you're a liar amen and then turn around tell you you can't sin now that sounds a little bit contradictory you know what does that sound like that god can't keep it straight but we know that's not true amen but how long did it take us to find out that james wasn't contrary to paul it took a profit right that's right it takes a profit to break down an individual to where we can see what's going on the prophet of god will say we sin every day and he said it's totally impossible for a christian to sin which one do you want i want an understanding of what's going on and in trying to do that i've tried to explain an individual in the thoughts you know go ahead to 18 8 brother and let's pull these a couple of these up then we'll run a few and then we'll we'll have to continue this this evening but we will continue this evening but this is from the message continuing for the fight 56 uh two and these were not on the line so i'll have to find where we're at but you'll get down to where he says we uh we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin all right where's that okay we got it underlined all right i'm shooting these two of them it's light in there you know i've worked them guys a lot in there and i appreciate them i'll go in there and give them a whole layout when i go back 18 a 18 b 18 c they they got to go back separate all of it and put in what i appreciate them all right we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day you sin paul said he had to die daily now who had ever thought that if a prophet hadn't said did we think paul saying i died daily i mean he was doing wrong daily we just think it means i die i die i die i die and then we die enough we did yeah see and if we say we have no sin then the bible says we make god to lie is that the scripture over in the little john's and we could not do that so we sin daily and it's god's grace that saves us and as we confess our wrongs god's just to forgive them in your your confession as long as it holds good your salvation is perfect same is with divine healing if your personal faith interests your personal faith all right now i didn't give them this one but i'll give it to you off the message hebrews chapter 6 paragraph 262 263 57 909 paul is explaining therefore leaving the principles of doctrine of christ let us go into perfection we got that this morning now that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blindless are you listening i gotta okay i figured they'd beat me if i goofed off enough they'd find it look how that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blindless not one sin in us see on us are you above temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we're in him and god could no more judge us than nothing couldn't be righteous or he couldn't be righteous he's already judged us in him when he judged christ he judged me he judge you and he can't judge you again because he took my judgment i've been redeemed i've been taken out of the pawnshop right right now two statements emphatically stating that we've seen every day that he said he did but now he goes on to like on the wings of snow white dove number 18 now and that's the way it is with a real christian did you know a real christian doesn't have even any sin at all imputed to him david said blessed is a man who god will not impute sin when you're washed in the blood of the lamb not make by make belief but really the blood of the lamb god does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it he said that was done once the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the world foundation of the world when he put your name on the lounge book of life that's all you can look at because you're redeemed from everything that was ever done you're washed in the blood of the lamb therefore there's no guile in you there's no unclean habit in you because the blood of the lamb has did this and god cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin offering laying there waiting for you well you say that gives me plenty of room then brother branham i can do what i want to he said i always do always but when a man can really see what jesus done for him and turn around and do something wrong or something country to him it shows he never received christ look at the next one number 19. which is questions and answers 59 uh 629 i know they're putting it up there but look what he says we're by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and free from sin we cannot sin there is an atonement waiting for us and if there is still desire in your heart to sin you have never been baptized into that body because you're dead and your life is hid in christ through god and sealed by the holy ghost christians don't sin they make mistakes they don't sin amen that's the reason they don't for he cannot sin they make mistakes number twenty hebrews chapter six part 3 57 9 15 in the morning you'll make mistakes you'll fall anybody reading that right you'll willfully do wrong no but the bible says if you sin willfully the prophet says you willfully you go out sometime and do things that don't mean you're lost that means you're going to get correction amen he says where it's impossible for that man to ever be born again that's one's been born of eternal life ever ever be gone again that's once been born of eternal life god is not an ending giver you don't do that look at the next one 21 questions and answers 1959 6 28 evening will you please explain what it means by sinneth not in first john 5 18 did we know that whosoever is born of god sent us not certainly not i just went through that he can't sin he's born of god sin is not he cannot sin the seed remains in him another scripture you might refer to here would be romans 4 8 which is really 5 8 4 4 5 and 8 coming through where david spoke we're gone david spoke over there years ago and said blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin because he does not sin let's go the other way number 22 paragraph 129 questions and answers 59 6 28 in the evening new christian sin absolutely no now watch there is no scripture where a christian sins he cannot sin i know that's a resentment to that i know there's a resentment we'll we'll go over here to first john and see what the scripture says a christian does not see him did you ever see a black white bird or a white black bird you ever see a drunk silver man nope he never did see a sinner saying either backwards and four backwards and four why because he's born of god and he cannot sin it goes down to adoption 23 which is preached in 1960 5 22 the morning service program 56 remember life's wednesday night no christian christian sin but a sinner cannot sin senator can't sin he's already a sinner he ain't going to hell for cutting your hair paint in your face that's what everybody teaches you're going to hell for one thing and that's unbelief got much more but we'll stop and just get the point then it looks like the bible is saying that you sin then the bible says you can't sin it looks like the prophet is saying you sin and then says you can't sin now are we gonna uh well over here it says this and i'll just rip out that page that don't work does it okay we take a profit well i'll read this one but i'll read that one we turn out to be bad people doing that called hypocrites would you say brother dale what is the truth of it the truth of it is that if god comes and lives in you that we read is christ in you the hope of glory that's the seed of god the new birth and that seed cannot sin because it's born of god inside of that soul is eternal life and you can never do wrong all right but outside is body and spirit that is still under satan's domain right so if i do wrong paul you do wrong he said i die daily but around you do wrong he said sin daily is that word sin only one definition is that word sin the only definition that you apply to it is unbelief the bible said he that sinned willfully after receiving the knowledge of the prophet said you willfully do wrong or boy you've confused us now i hadn't confused you he's already confused because if you didn't know the answer to it that's the confusion what a man said one time not speaking he said i hate it when that man speaks he's the only one who had to answer i said if i hadn't had an answer i wouldn't have been speaking i wouldn't have been talking if i had the answer huh all right so then sin has to be defined as not just always being unbelief because if it's unbelievable i'll die and go to hell over in the scripture there's a scripture that i wanted to get to but first john 5 7 16. the bible says there is a sin that's not unto death if you look up that same word as in the same scripture it says there's a sin that's not unto death the same verse says that there is a sin unto death okay if any man see his brother sin or sin which is not unto death so there's a sin not unto death go look up at that word sin and then look up that word sin down here i'm going to give you the same definition so we line that up we brought around and said sin is unbelief well brother branham you're an unbeliever because you said you sinned now we go back to where he said christians make mistakes right and even willfully will make mistakes knowing better if you see his brother sent a sin that is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give unto him give him life for them that sin not unto death that means you can ask for your kids if you see them out there living and wrong and doing wrong go ask for them because they ain't blasphemed the holy ghost yet sure they're unbelievers it ain't blasphemed there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it so there's got to be a defining and i know people won't like that i don't have any other words sorry no edu education i'm not slew and suave like all of these other preachers i just say it like i believe it so it must be that there is a sin that is totally unbelief and when you cross that line there's no hopes of getting back that is unbelief but then there's life living in earth that is sin that is not unto death but it's daily things we do speed get upset eat too much oh we don't want to get on that do we you know it's a sin to eat too much you need a long sermon on that about how the world is starving to death and we're packing it down okay so there must be something about that little word sin that we need a revelation of amen that we can see that we do things ourselves wrong that we ought not to do and we ask god to forgive us for it right that don't mean you're an unbeliever come on brother random power they unbelievers or were they human beings that was living in the world that their soul is sealed in and cannot do wrong but the body and the spirit is still in this world realm and you're fighting it out now you call it just a unit you call it a unit and you're gonna make everybody die and go to hell even the prophet and paul too because we got both of them where they said they'd do wrong and called it sin but you see that's where we just get an idea yes we get a thought well we're just a unit well then where do you sin from if you're a christian that's right now we're not we don't i i've got to quote here okay the prophet said we don't have to sin okay so we we keep that straight all right we don't say we have to we just can't help it ah now don't go that route you don't have to sin we sin willfully then and be careful because you're borderlining it because if you drop on over there's no more sacrifice you see church then even that scripture we send willful after receiving the knowledge of truth that remains no more sacrifice i've tried to explain that scripture and got into trouble about it you realize if you or me we do something wrong and we do not repent of that there is going to be a judgment day not deciding whether you're going to heaven or not right that's the white throne judgment there's another judgment of the deeds done in the body and we don't get rid of them here we're going to answer there right there is no sacrifice do you get that scripture have you ever thought of it on that side he that sins will have to receive the knowledge of the truth that remains no more sacrifice i go out and do something wrong to brother colley and i won't go back and apologize to him i'm going to give an account for that one day because i don't have an automatic covering to keep me covered i do have the blood of jesus christ to keep me from being lost but i don't have it to just go around and do anything in the world that scripture is exactly right there remaineth no more sacrifice there's not a sacrifice to cover us if we do wrong as christians now you understand what i mean the repentance is what keeps it from being there not an automatic covering well well i know i was bad back there but well i'm over here on a new birth now i know i'm driving this brand new cadillac that i stole last week but i don't need to take it back because i'm a christian now oh yeah brother motor always said if you steal a man's horse take his horse back it's the best way to get rid of things do you understand what i'm trying to say what is sin a christian cannot sin from his soul but he can do wrong in his body and flat and spirit of course the body is nothing without the spirit so it's all going back into the spirit realm make the life statement brother ronald said adam had eternal life in his soul and he sold us all into sin that's your prophet blasphemous names go read it adam had eternal life well now if he had eternal life you're going to put eve out of it when they had the same soul theophany do we need to quote brother right now what about at church what is sin well that's just unbelief well i'm looking at the most unbelievers in the world right here and then i turn around to see myself i don't have a mirror but i guess i can get a reflection you know because that's all we are we're about to sit and save by grace but when i do wrong i want to cry and say god forgive me forgive me lord he said we make mistakes he said you didn't really do that see that's that old husband we've talked about quite a while trying to raise back up that still lives in this body and spirit that i'm dwelling within only the lord jesus had his under complete control that's right i think on these times 12 o'clock let's stand we won't sing we'll just be dismissed remember the service this afternoon lord jesus we thank you we ask you now that you'd go with us we'll go and eat natural meals things lord and bring us back together this evening that we can continue on talking about you and we love you father and we thank you but most of all we love you for revealing your truth because that truth can set us free then i can be as paul said with my inward man i can serve you lord but with the outward man he said i serve the law of sin not that he was a sinner like unbelief but yet he was just a human being living in the world and us having problems just help us now god has to bless us in your love in jesus name if anybody has a need coming we'll pray if you don't then take the name of jesus with you if you have a knee just come we'll pray sorrow end of woe he will in comfort give you hey let's just pray father in the name of jesus christ we lay our hands on her believing lord your word that by your stripes he's healed we condemn this hurting in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen anybody else would have any need you
