you you happy birthday to you oh happy birthday to you every day happy birthday to you happy also brother Ryan has a testimony this is not going to be a quick one yes it am I'll go as quick as I can turn on the PowerPoint please all right can y'all see that pretty good can you turn off the lights I can't see that at all all right that's a little better so this is my prayer closet 45 ton prayer closet I'll go ahead and skip to the end and tell you all the result the other day I had my first wreck and everybody turned out fine perfect perfectly fine by the grace of God but I got to give a long backstory to it I'll be as brief as I can but for you to understand the background here so um first off okay so what what happens is I I drive every day to work 15 minutes to work clock in get a truck get a trailer drive out to the farm back up to the chicken house this is just one of our typical farms in South Carolina all right we have a lot in South Carolina and North Georgia and all over I back up to the house the crew takes over from there loading the chickens onto the trailer with the hydrostatic loader the guys stand in the house they pick up the chickens load them in the cages now three big problems inherent danger dangers with driving these trucks is number one cages weigh 700 lb empty they're solid still so a loaded cage like the one can y'all see that that he's raising up on the truck ways about the weight of a small car 22 to 23 or 2400 lb so I'm hauling from Georgia usually I haul about 20 cages at a time so I got about 20 cars plus the weight of my truck and trailer the other day when I had the wreck I weighed 86,500 lb all right second problem we're not only heavy but we're very topheavy unlike conventional trailers you know like brother Joe Salas drives you know there's a in a box trailer usually the the load is sitting on pallets on the floor on the deck so it goes up to maybe yay high ours is distributed all the way up to the very top so we're extremely topheavy which means in a wreck if you swerve you're very likely to turn over problem number three these doors yall probably can't see that but each compartment there's 15 compartments on each cage and the doors only take about 5 pounds of pressure to open it makes them easy to unload at the at the plant they set them on a hydraulic dumper turns the cage over the chickens fall out 5 lbs to open each door and there's 140 lbs of chickens behind each door so if you stop really hard chickens slide forward doors come open chickens go everywhere on the highway three big problems with driving these trucks it's okay if nobody pulls out in front of you all right well uh go on to the next slide please this is just a closer up view of the truck uh next slide so this is where the wreck happened the other day 7 miles north from here on Georgia 365 uh yall are familiar with Will Banks Road maybe some of y'all well just south of Baldwin the city of Baldwin there's a Dairy Queen on that side of the road this is southbound 365 Northbound just 7 miles north of here Dairy Queen's over here somewhere back over this way is the Hartford house and all that all right I was headed southbound on 365 at 65 M hour wearing weighing 86,500 lb a woman pulls off of will Banks Road this about 10:00 in the morning this past last Monday real light traffic it was after morning rush hour she comes across the Northbound Lanes with no problem crosses the Medan and you wouldn't think being that I'm right on her I'm right at the intersection that she would come in front of me but she did right smack dab to my Lane about 30 to 40 feet ahead of me when I'm going 95 ft per second so about 40 feet ahead ahead of me gives me less than half a second to react anybody ever had a wreck all right when you have a wreck this is my first one not speaking from a lot of experience but when you have a wreck a lot of times it's Instinct that takes over it's not you it's a Jesus take the will moment all right that was this type of moment I'm going to pause here and give you a quick other background there's two things i' always thought would happen if somebody pulled out front of me Point Blank either I would hit them which would either hang them up under my underc carriage and I drag them down the highway or they get under my truck because and I might run over them in pretty good ways or I'd knock them straight out a long ways either way it'd be detrimental for them option two be line for the ditch turn the wheel really hard trailer turns over on top of them that happened around brother around the time brother George Canada passed away some of you might remember that at the funeral home down the hall from Brother George Canada was I think a couple occupants of a Ford F-150 that was hit by one of our trucks also not a live Haul truck it was haul and frozen chicken he was going northbound on 365 southbound Ford F-150 turned in front of him he hit him then he swerved instinctively turned his load of chickens over on top of him made them pancakes all right killed him so those aren't good options option C that I never ever thought of is Christ and here's what took over saw him in the southbound lane 65 mil an hour she comes into my lane I had a half a second to react I didn't have time to honk didn't have time to Blink really had time to say oh my goodness with a stream of exclamation points behind it I got on the edge of my seat jabed the brake pedal and did a I never even knew about this maneuver God took over a sid step swerve that's the only thing I know to call it I Sid stepped about a half a lane and straightened back up in order to stay underneath my trailer so it wouldn't turn over on them I got into this right turning lane all right when I did that that was still enough to make the trailer oscillate like this it was still trying to turn over but by God's grace it didn't I hit her and you can't tell in this picture cuz this is after the wreck by the way you can't see any damage on my truck but here's the initial point of impact on my truck if I hadn't have Sid stepped it would have been here so the initial point of impact with her rearview mirror then her front quarter panel hit right here on my left steer Tire I chewed her all up right there and then she rubbed down this side and then that initial impact knocked her around this way she entered my Lane kind of at a angle like this I knocked around backwards in the back of her car hit my front drive axle on the outside tire and these uh steel step mounts for the aluminum uh fuel tank steps dug into the skin of her car really deep now then it shot her off onto towards the grass median here and I just at that time was just trying to stop and not turn over I finally came to a stop took me 500 ft or more about after the impact to stop and I see her wobbling out of the highway her car is wobbling over to the try to get over to the uh me to the shoulder to get out of traffic so I said well she's all right she got out she started walking around I said thank the Lord I got out started to check out my load you would think 300 C doors would be open that's how many doors we have is 300 there's 20 chickens behind each door about 6,000 chickens at a time you would think all of them would be open with me stopping that hard I locked up one of my tandems well I came to a stop checked all of them only one door out of 300 was open so trailer was upright no chickens Spilled Out they died several hours later but they survived the initial red okay they made it to their destination so then I thought well now I just hit somebody with a tractor trailer maybe I should check on her she's wandering around but still she might need medical attention so I I start the long walk back to her go to the next slide please this is just a little bit closer view that's after the repairs were made knocked off the oil Hub seal that right there and that was had to be replaced very minimal damage next slide and that's her car and the lady there now this is where I came to a stop I started this long walk first I was walking then I started to jog then I started to run because as I kept hollering for her I said later you okay you okay and she said uh she didn't even acknowledge me she was trying to get into this store in the back this is a truck driver's worst nightmare because after you just hit a car you don't want to think that there's a baby on board oh man I had just shut that door with a tractor trailer so it wasn't coming open that one wouldn't have done any good she runs around to the driver's side by this time I had run over here didn't even bother to talk to really anymore I just I just wanted to see if that baby was okay so I opened the back door and the pass on the left side got in there there's a little 19-month old beautiful baby boy in perfect shape not a scratch not a bruise and he wasn't crying he wasn't even whimpering he was looking around as if to say mama that was fun let's do it again you know he had that kind of look on his face a few minutes later he was playing peekaboo he said peoo peoo he's playing peekaboo with all of us standing around there so me and this lady Susan and her boy John Patrick we stood in the grass and got to Fellowship for the next couple hours my first question was well I wonder why you pulled out in front of me now you say you should have been mad at I wanted to hug them too because they should have been dead I was this close from looking at their dead bodies in this car and instead they're standing here in perfect shape wasn't a bit mad I just all I could kept saying was hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I was speaking in tongues almost cuz she's alive both of them are alive so we we stood in the grass and talked for a while and my first question why don't you pull out in front of me just curious making conversation she said well I thought you in the right turning lane which is sensible most of us have misjudged the lane before even in broad daylight I told her lady just a few months ago I did the same thing I didn't get hit but I did that on our family vacation pulled out in front of somebody and P and forth CU I thought they were in a different Lane she's having off day she said I said what's what's the problem I going to tell you about this lady she came from California this the best I understand her story she came all the way from California to North Georgia or actually to South Georgia Albany where her grandson lives that boy that was with her is her grandson her daughter the boy's mom is in Lee Arendale prison the state prison she didn't never mention the dad I guess he's out of the picture so she come all way across the country like that brother like brother bam talked about that mother deer she's got a real mother instinct going all across the country no one she'll face dangerous not no one she get hit by a truck came all the way across the country to South Georgia to reside and and and raise this boy well that particular day she came up from South Georgia all the way up to leale prison to try to get some signatures from her daughter to get custody of that kid so she can raise him she didn't even get the the signatures the girl had gotten moved to a different facility I don't understand exactly what happened came all the way up here then to not get signatures and instead get hit by a truck furthermore she was lost because leale Prison is down there in Alto she's up here in Baldwin pulls out days confused lost distraught if that's not enough she just had a hernia surgery now she's facing another hernia surgery she said coming up so you're talking about problems that's the lady we need to pray for I mentioned her Wednesday night y'all be praying for Susan that's her name and at the end of it all when I parted ways with her stood here and I told her I said Susan you know you're going to think this weird I just me the lady I said Susan I love you you've got a real mother instinct you are a real mother and I said you rais up this boy and tell him about Jesus Christ the way that my grandmother did me and my mom you know there's about five mothers in my life that are very important to me and we named two of them named two of our kids after two of them sister June and my great- grandmother Ula that have had great influence on my life brother bandom said that mothers are the Fifth Gospel you know Matthew Martin Luke and John and mothers mothers I told this lady said you mothers can have an influence in little kids' Hearts like Rachel and uh Monica teaching those little ones in Sunday school they're perfect sister gaale teaching all those little ones you know when she used to because you have a place in their heart that nobody else can influence you know a father can influence them in different ways but you're their you know your Mo their mother and she began to break down and cry and she said I will there's one last part of this testimony that uh it's just speculation but our God is a mighty God and he works in mysterious ways a few months prior to this at the beginning of the summer I hit a dog I've never hit an animal as big as a dog I've run over squirrels and possums never run over a dog but it was in this very same spot now that's odd isn't God odd because of all the places I drive all over North Georgia and South Carolina you wouldn't think I'd hit a dog and a woman in the same place so what about that and I thought about it and pondered it for days I don't know but I can speculate one thing I said option C Christ took over when I did that swerve that Sid step swerve all right Christ took over I regretted hitting that dog I hit him I exploded him he disintegrated I hit him so hard I never swerved I never tried to miss him I laid into the air horn for quite some time he stood his ground I thought this is very strange and then I hit him and I turned my head I couldn't stand to watch but the way that I hit him it took him forever to decompose I know I'm grossing you out but I watched his remains in the road he had a nicely neatly stacked um fur coat in the right turning lane and for months I watched those remains I came by and I said I wish I had swerved I wish I had been more what's the word uh reactive you know or responsive instead of just freezing up I have a tendency to freeze up when I'm going to hit something because I don't want to turn over and or have a wreck so maybe just maybe God was working on my instinct reprogramming me to where that when this accident happened cuz I think God knew whenever this accident happened that I would react in that way and save their lives so it wasn't me that saved their life it was Christ all the way through am that's all the testimony I have thank [Applause] you sister Monica Sunday school class please come up for your special as we sing B it unto me [Music] to me according to your word according to your

we have the answer he amen he said in his word ye shall know the truth amen you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what a privilege It Is to Be Free People amen we certainly enjoyed our brother's testimony of how the God was gracious to him and to the woman and her son and I do feel sorry for the chickens you know it's go survive a major accident they would have gave him a little little Grace amen that was that was comical brother God I thought that was funny amen may the Lord richly bless you certainly wonderful to be here I enjoyed uh just like being at home this morning I just enjoyed the preaching and just being ourself and we trust something was said to encourage you and to help you and truly that's my desire friends is that I could just be a witness for my Lord amen and you know someone told me one time the greatest compliment they ever had they got it at work and said somebody walked up to them and said you know I know we don't believe aik I know you believe different than I do was a a message brother was telling was telling this and he said I I know that uh that you don't believe the way we do but I just want you to know that every time I get around you said I I feel the presence of Jesus Christ and and the brother was telling me he said you know that was the greatest compliment and that is right and that's the greatest compl not oh man what a preacher I ain't interested in that but for someone to say I saw Jesus when you preached this morning that's what it's all about amen so may the Lord richly bless you if you have your Bibles this evening turn with us to the book of First Kings we going to read there uh from First Kings chapter 17 uh starting at verse 8 and very very familiar scripture to us all and we actually was going to go another Direction uh but I just kind of sitting in the study and listening and singing I just kind of uh wanted to go this direction so we trust that it'll be a blessing to you amen amen First Kings chapter 17 verse 8 praise the Lord and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise thee and get thee to zerth which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee now that word commanded it means to appoint to ordain of a Divine act to appoint ordain of a Divine act so he arose and went to zerth and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it it must have been a Kentucky and and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in that hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make it for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth and the same God that made her that promise has made us the same promise in this hour that we're living in amen and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah now that's a good thing to do just do what Elijah says to do and she and he and her house did eat many days notice there wasn't one meal for Elijah and one meal for the widow woman they all ate from the same Barrel Hallelujah and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah Amen Let Us bow our head I want to speak to you this evening for a few minutes on the meal Barrel the mill Barrel do you love him Heavenly Father Thy word is true in the name of Jesus Christ We Gather here this evening Lord to give you honor and praise for Thou Art Worthy and Lord we believe you're the same yest yesterday today and forever and Lord we believe that whatever we have need of has been provided for us in this hour you are our healer you are our guide you are our comfort you are our strength you are our joy you're our Shield you're our buckler you're you're our helmet you're our feet are sawed with the preparation of the go you're our everything Lord and we look to you this evening knowing that everything we have need of Lord lays in the message of the hour God what a what a privilege it is Lord to Feast upon this unfailing word body of the son a man Ministry Lord come bless your children today move among your people Lord bless brother Samuel here Lord Brother Wade the other officers of the church God bless their Ministries use them in a great way Lord we pray may your presence come Among Us in such a way that when we leave Lord may we say did not our hearts burn within us thank you for moving Among Us this morning and speaking to our hearts Lord and those that responded and father may you speak once again Lord and when we leave Lord there's needs here father but there's not a need here greater than you so we just Look to You may you come and do great things we pray for we humbly ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen amen God bless you Saints you may be seated praise the Lord how many is full of food amen well we'll try to preach above it amen amen God richly bless you amen now in our scripture reading this afternoon we find that Israel excuse me we find find that there's a Great Famine in the land for the Bible says that it had not rained nor due in over three and a half years now the reason for this famine was because of the mighty Prophet Elijah under the leadership of God had walked right up into the presence of the king and he had pronounced judgment upon his kingdom because of the moral Decay that had taken place and we know that our nation today is in the condition that it's in it's not because an army from the outside has invaded us but it's the corruption of our own moral Decay amen our problems has come from within our nation because we have left the fundamentals of the Gospel that God gave us to live by our nation was not founded upon Islamic our nation was not founded upon some other religion but it was founded upon the word of God Amen is that right friends now you know I say today if people don't want to abide by the word of God let them find them another country to go to [Applause] praise the Lord sorry I just had to say that but it's the truth for why should we change the way we believe to accommodate everybody else let them come God's way for it is the only way amen amen hallelujah so we then we find then that judgment was upon this Kingdom the the the prophet of God said the people was poverty stricken there was no water he said it was a reflection the condition of the nation was the reflection of the moral decay of that Nation but Elijah Was Not Afraid oh God give us a men today that's Anointed with that same anointing he was not afraid to stand before that King for he had been in the presence of one who was greater than that King he had been in The Presence of Jehovah therefore he knew exactly where he was standing and I'm so glad today we're not wishy-washy we don't know where we're standing we have been in the presence of God hallelujah and God has established for us in this hour where we are to stand is that right he had been in the presence of God and anytime a man is standing in the presence of God he knows exactly where he's standing and Elijah walked right up into the presence of that King he didn't stutter he didn't stammer he didn't apologize cuz he knew what he was talking about he walked right up into the presence of that King he could say to that King thus sayith the Lord God of Israel there will be no rain nor do until I call for it huh now that's awful bold words for a say of a man that was born of a woman where did he get such boldness Hallelujah it will not rain nor doe until I call for it why did he say that why because it was according he said according to my word it will not happened according to my word why because he had the word of the Lord he was a prophet and the word of the Lord comes to the prophet notice he spoke as though it was God himself speaking Elijah spoke as if it was God himself speaking now listen to this quote I know you don't mind me quoting the prophet said Jesus said if ye shall say what is it when you're out from under Babylon when you're out from under unbelief when you're out from under Superstition when you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life on your voice is his voice you are he said you are because I spoke it when we're out from under confusion when we're out from under babbling when we're out from under Superstition oh you better be careful when we know where we stand as God's children as sons of God do we speak with the authority of the word father we are the Seed of Abraham Abraham did not speak by emotion he did not speak by sensation but he spoke by the faith in the word hallelujah amen said will not do nor rain until I call for it amen it as though God himself speaking why he had the mind of God what did the prophet of God say the bride she have thus sayith the Lord or keep still she knows what he wants done with the word amen oh we live so beneath our preg it not rain or DW will fall from Heaven till I call for it yes sir he was in the presence of God Amen do you love him Hallelujah notice the continuity of the prophet in his God God and His Prophet rather look at the continuity he knew exactly what God wanted for that hour amen well that reminds me of another Son of God remember Adam in the Bible amen remember Adam God who created the animals come on it's not a trick question God created the animals but who named the animals God didn't name them Adam named them how did Adam know what to name him because Adam had the mind of God Amen he knew a he said you're a monkey you're a cheetah you're a bear you're an eagle and God said amen one time did God have to call Adam over say Adam son you're you're doing a good job Daddy's proud of you but you messed up son no you called that right there a bear that's not a bear that's a monkey over there is a bear no sir not one time on brother Adam said you're a monkey you're a bear you're a cheetah you're a lion you're a tiger and God said that's exactly what I was thinking there was another Son of God stooding this day said I no longer call you Church Hallelujah but I call you bride and God said that's exactly what I was thinking amen hallelujah now it looked like Elijah it looks like Elijah is not too smart because Elijah stood there in that kingdom come on and pronounced judgment upon the very Kingdom he was standing in it looks like he would have went over here at Commerce and brought judgment up on Lula in our thinking that would have been the thing to do but you see he knew he was not afraid to stand there in that Kingdom and pronounce judgment upon that Kingdom you know why cuz Elijah don't have a place to go right right right EXA Oh my he done call judgment upon that Nation there'll be no rain there'll be no do pronouncing judgment upon the very Nation he was standing in but he was not worried because God had done gave him a place to go they rejected God they rejected this Prophet they rejected his word and God was going to dry him up right and God is drying this nation of now he's drying up for the burning FRS you can't even look at a car anymore you can't pull up at the red light look at the car beside you cuz you don't know whether they're going to shoot you or not you know why everybody's s grouchy you know why everybody's s grumpy they're drying up brother is that not true friends what did Brother bam say that a that a sticker was it was a rod up Leaf because of a lack of moisture amen God's drying this nation up for the burning you know they say California is sinking so many inches a day or so many inches a year or a month or something like that you know why cuz it's pulling so much water out of the ground because there's they're drying up amen everybody knows wood burns better

people that'll make you happy why some of y'all frowning for we done got a place to go I guarantee you if you been on the boat of on the Titanic that night you wish you had a place to go amen let me tell you it's time to change ships they said I said we don't need God we don't need nobody God himself couldn't seek this ship and the prophet said God by his mighty hand put the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean Hallelujah let me tell you the ship of America sinking it's time to change boats friends amenallah prepared place for a prepared people I'm not worried I'm not sweating you know the prophet of God said if they push that button before one bomb will strike this nation the bride will be gone the prophet of God said they'll never shut her up God will take her up [Applause] Hallelujah they may silence the workmen but the work will go on you're crazy well I'm happy amen amen hallelujah Elijah said Lord Lord what do you want me to do God said get up yonder by the Brook of Cherub and sit down huh all right it's a very bad place that's where God wants me to go that's where I'll go but let me tell you if God tells you to go somewhere that's the best place you can be they us to argue they us to De baate about it if God tells you to do something do it if God tells you to repent repent don't try to make excuses while my family is that way it ain't going to work just do what God says right huh cuz what you want me to do Lord I pronounced Judgment of what you God said go up by the Brook of chth and sit down amen amen if the path leads our follow it if God's leading follow it amen so he always up there and he sits down said now Lord what do you want me to do and God says sit there yeah pretty simple ain't it but you see it's always God in Simplicity right we try to dissect it and figure it out when we do we're a million miles off let's just believe it the way he said it God knows how to how does God interpret his word by bringing it to past is that right am amen just go up there and sit down just go up there and stay there you know so Elijah goes up there and he sits down and the first thing you know I get a little hungry whole belly starts growling a little bit and he looks around there ain't no Subway ain't no McDonald's are you still with me huh Lord I'm a little hungry I need some food I'm up here because you put me up here let me tell you something God's will will never take us where his grace cannot keep us amen hallelujah oh thank you Lord amen if that's where God put him at the best place to be God I'm getting a little hungry don't worry about that time here come go here come a raven come on a ren a bird came by do you believe that are you serious you scientific educated smart Americans believe that a bird he ain't got no hands how' you cook [Music] it someone might say where Holy Roller go anyhow where there's that old Holy Roller he went up around the hill and sat down God told him to and did you see that see that reflection right there see it right that that's his head that's his b head right there yes what's he doing up there has he lost his mind talking about three pools and seven Thunders and has he lost his mind yes we've lost our mind we've got the mind of Christ amen amen amen you see him right up there there he is I would you look at that up be he's crazy he's lost his mind he's a fanatic I don't know why they're surprised you that's what they say about us oh he'll come back he'll come back when he gets hungry he'll come crawling back you crazy guy sitting up there in the Sun said well he'll die up there he's a fanatic he'll come down when he gets thirsty he'll be back when it starts drying up a little bit oh yeah you see it look like it's the worst place to come because you know water runs downhill so where's water going to dry up first to me it would be on top of the mountain so if you think of God's going to sustain a man he'd put him down in the valley but God didn't put him in a valley God put him on the mountain to show that it wasn't a brook that was sustaining it was God that was sustaining him oh don't you see friends God puts us in situations sometimes we don't understand but he does it to show his love to us he does it to show how big he is how great he is how much he loves us amen he'll be back he'll be back he gets a little thirsty he'll come crawling back he'll want some of this old Baptist water he'll want some of this old Catholic water he'll be back Whatever Gets dry but you see it wasn't Elijah that was getting thirsty right right it was Elijah without water on it was them it was the moers it was the scorners all friends let them laugh at us let them make fun of us let them call us what they want to call us let them say what they want to say I'm not the one without water amen I'm not the one without water they are they are Elijah was up on top of that Hill brother he's sitting up there he wasn't wor to been he had water 6 o' in the morning he had water 9:30 he had water 11:00 2:00 p.m. all you got to do is push play he had water he could backstroke in it he could swim in it come [Music] on he had water everybody else was drying up right nobody else had water but Elijah I wish y'all had some water it's so good when you're sweating when you're hot and it's dry yeah just a good drink amen so good I do wasn't worried he had water in the morning he had water in noon time he had water at supper time amen hallelujah every time Elijah wanted to drink he just let over and huh and you get a little bit hungry here come a raven by with a sandwich in his mouth here you are Elijah they asked brother B do you really believe that a crow fed Elijah oh my think about that he said do you really believe that brother Bron he said I do I believe it with all my heart why because God said so right exactly right said how did them Ravens get bread how did them Ravens get meat brother brandham how did those birds fry that meat brother bam gave a scientific answer you know what he said I don't know I don't know maybe Elijah didn't know either but the only thing he knew that when he was hungry the Ravens brought him food oh let me say you this afternoon I don't know how the Holy Ghost works I don't know how he does what he does I don't know how he makes blinded eyes open I don't know how a man can hit a car at 65 mph and nobody gets hurt I don't know how God does that I just know God does that amen I don't know how God made Jessica see I don't know how God got am I don't know how God got her have a wheelchair I don't know how he did it exctly I just know that he did it amen they told me they said Mr Ward if you go into a strange town and your daughter gets sick and they take an x-ray of her head do not let them operate on her when they see the condition of her brain they will want to do surgery do not let them you know what I said I don't care what the X-ray shows I don't care what the MRI shows I don't care what the ctk shows I just look at what I've got amen amen hallelujah well the doctor said the doctor said well is wrong A lot of times people hang their souls on what the doctor said do you know I worked with doctors doctors bury their mistakes amen I got nothing against doctors now huh I believe in doctors but when the doctor said they can't do no more to help you I know another doctor youall check out God hallelujah you know what he never even s me a bill people hang so much on their doctor do you know out of ever class of 100 doctors somebody finished last that's right you ever thought about that you ever thought it might be your doctor think about it there's a man up our way up Greenville Tennessee he went to the doctor they did PSA level on him for prostate you know they called him said you need to come in somebody's a beeping or something it's all right said you need to come in said you got cancer we need to get right on it he said can you give me a few days said you ain't got but a few days you need to come in he said well I got to take care of my cows and stuff said I'll be right in so he goes writes a note goes out in the field takes a gun takes his own life he left the note and said I'd rather take my own life than die of cancer yeah a few weeks after the funeral the doctor's office called said they made a terrible mistake the report would belong to another person had got put on the wrong chart said brother why you saying that I'm saying that to say this I believe in doctors friend you sick go to the doctor but when the doctor says he can't help you I know someone who can is that all right friends Surly believe in Divine Healing right amen I don't know how God does these things I just know he does them I don't have to figure it out I don't have to prove there's a bridge right right come on friends I don't have to do that I don't believe it because I saw the bridge I don't believe it because I saw a picture of a cloud I believe it because God revealed it to me amen I don't need some scientific explanation I don't need that God revealed it to me by his grace right thank you Lord amen hallelujah glory to God down in the valley they were drying up but up on the hill Elijah had three meals a day amen provided by the hand of God Amen you know when I was in the Army I joined the army when I was 16 year old my mom and dad had a sign for me i' done it so I could get the GI bill so I could go to college so I joined when I 16y old and I went into active duty at 17 I was in a program called Depp delay entry program I was delayed 11 months before I went on active duty my whole senior year in high school I was already in the Army I already signed up and so I went into the army and basic training I was the youngest guy that called me baby face you know the first time I shaved I was in the Army it's true so I was you know I've seen too many John Wayne movies growing up so I thought I had to be in one of those rough units yeah so I joined the 18th Arab born core field artillery direct fire support for the 82nd we could be anywhere in the world in 24 hours and ready to fight but in order to do that we spent our whole life in the woods training training training training always training you realiz that when President Reagan was shot I was in the woods you know I was that when he got out of the hospital in the woods we spent our whole and so in the woods you know we we would we would train for combat situations so because we was training for combat situations they wanted to bring us steaks and they wanted to bring us baked potatoes but they brought us sea rations how many's ever been in the Army knows what I'm talking you had remember the SE rations some people call them MREs MRIs different ones but SE rations now these SE RS was a prepackaged meal you know I remember some of them was ham and eggs I used to pray I wouldn't get that one beef and potatoes it was pretty good if you could heat it up the best was tuna oh man when I got tuna I was in heaven and so we had a little uh instrument called a P38 how many remembers that little P38 you know why they called it P38 because you would turn it 38 times and it would open the can I've still got mine still got mine from my days of the army of P38 and so they would give us these prepackaged meals now I was in the Army from 1977 until 81 four years and they would bring us these ser and we'd open up this box and we would pull them out now on each one of them was it would say ham and eggs or or beef stew or or I'm trying to tuna was one of them and different ones that they gave us and they' have some peanut butter and it had a little piece of chewing gum and had some cocoa powder had some coffee Salt and Pepper all that was in a prepackaged meal but when you pulled out the can and looked at it it had a date on it it told you when that can was processed now I was in the Army from 77 to 81 but I would get cans of SE rations 1951 1949 oh my God that's where I was born 1967 1963 but you know you take that P38 it would be sealed but you take that P38 and open up that can it would go yeah and when you open it up if you put a little fire to it it actually wasn't too bad especially if he hungry amen so when I got out of the army now you know I joined the army I wanted to see the world I was an old boy from Tennessee never got to see anything I I forget even how old I was the first time ever saw the ocean we was just poor we never was able to go anywhere so I joined the army I wanted to see the world so I joined the army guess where I went North Carolina all four years North Carolina it was Unreal I had the same locker and bed for four years so I got out of the Army in 81 and then as I told you this morning the Lord came to me in a little building down there in Jonesburg I gave my heart to the Lord I found out brother Wade I was in another Army right GL and when I got into God's Army guess what he's let me see the world I've been in 29 some countries preach the gospel by the grace of God isn't that wonderful you know the Bible say he'll give you the desire of your heart he just knows how to do those things just to show you how much he loves you amen amen so I found out I was in another Army God's chosen Army right and when I found out I was in God's Army guess what I found out God also has some pre-prepared meals right and they had a date on them but when you opened up and put it in there and push play it was just as fresh I looked at some of the dates 1947 faith is a substance 1954 God's only provided way of dealing with sin 1962 in time evangelism 1959 looking to the Unseen Los Angeles California 1963 the open of the seals 1965 the Rapture it was just as fresh as it was the day it was preached now when my daughter was hurt she was in a coma on life support for 11 days she was in a coma for weeks and weeks she's struck by a train brother Bert Thompson brother I go to church with I his wife was my first convert we went to college together when I came back off of Christmas break and was saved I got the witness and she was my first convert so she brother bur came down met they married now they got a house full of kids and live happily ever after anyway brother bur came down to the hospital to see me he said brother Daryl I was on the way down here tonight and I was listening to the adoption series it says it sounds like exactly brother brandham was praying it sounds exactly like brother brandham was praying for your daughter because now in the accident you see I know some of you know brother some of you saw the video and I appreciate you taking the time off your busy schedule to watch Jessica's story but two of my family was killed and my little baby girl was dying she was only three year old she actually she turned three in the hospital so he comes down he C he said you want to hear it I said sure So he goes out the car he brings the tape in now we I I had read that soft music will help the brain to heal so he played soft classical music soft gospel music you know and of course we played tapes of brother Brenham there in in the I see you in the room there where she was at and we just kept those things playing and so we go in there and so we take out a tape and we put this tape in and he had left it right there where brother Ben begins to pray and if you don't mind if I just like to to share this with you this is what he said and manifested sons of God now remember two of my family was killed and my little girl was dying and brother Bert said it sounds exactly like he was praying for your daughter and now it's called upon us to go immediately to God and each of us fathers thinks what if that was our little little girl and how our hearts would burn and hurt within us and we would call to the churches to immediately have prayer and some Father's Heart Is Burning and aching Lord May that great person of the Holy Ghost come just now to that Father's Heart take away every Shadow of Doubt every ache and let him know that thou art God and there is no disease can stand in thy presence when thy Divine commission has been carried out by thy church and thy people and through the week we pray and since last Sunday I have thought on these ways or these means of prayer we do not have very much of a weapon as far as it looks to the world but this little sling slot is deadly when it's held in the fingers of Faith oh Lord May our prayer strike home that death Yonder that hangs over that child may it be shattered the darkness and the Gloom away from beside the bedside of that infant or that baby or child little girl may the great light of God's presence shine upon it and may it come home from that hospital a well child God we know just across the river our loved one weight and it's glorious but we love our little ones and we pray Lord that For Your Glory you'll spare the life of that child we as your church rebuke that death and say stand still Yonder you can't take that child because we claim its life for the kingdom of God's sake Grant these things Lord to go straight to the mark As We direct them in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior amen and after a while brother Bert left and the nurse came came into the room and she said Mr Ward I said yes ma'am she said was that you praying for your daughter I said no ma'am she said was that someone in your church praying for your daughter I said no ma'am I said that prayer was prayed over 35 years ago Hallelujah but you see it was just as fresh H Elijah's drinking the water eating food that a crow brought him but one day the river the creek begin to dry up the brook begin to dry up and God showed Elijah Vision said go down to the city for I have commanded not the Ravens this time but I have commanded a widow woman to sustain you huh he took him to the pur of the poor I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you and she didn't even have enough meal in the barrel for her or her son am and God said I've done commanded her to feed you amen hallelujah do you love him I've commanded it I have ordained it oh blessed be the name of the Lord when God ordains anything it's got to happen right right right it's there God will meet it I've commanded a widow woman there to take care of you to sustain you now think brother can can I have just a few minutes think is it not a strange thing that God would send his Prophet to a widow woman's house what a place to send a man of God but you see she must have been a real virtuous woman right or he would have never sent his Prophet down there right amen she must have been a real virtuous woman or God would have never sent the prophet to her now notice neither one of these people knew each other he just knew her by Vision they never knew each other like the black woman in Memphis when the prophet of God went to her house being led by the spirit and she's standing out there by the gate and she said morning Parson he said how I how' you know I was a preacher she said not only that I knew you was coming said where's your briefcase you're supposed to have a briefcase supposed to have a satchel he said I left it in the room he said William Brenham I pray for the sick ever heard of me no sir I ain't never heard of you she know brother Bram from Adam but she knew God she got a hold of God God got a hold of his Prophet Hallelujah and send him down to the woman's house she didn't know him he didn't know her but he was looking for her that's my Ministry is catch that bride right she must have been an honorable woman she must have been the type of woman that Elijah was a man for how can two walk together except they agree now God chose this woman out of all women so she was a chosen lady exactly right he chose her out of all the women that was there all the women that was in Israel to entertain his prophet and he would have never chosen immoral woman to entertain his Prophet The Prophet said this widow woman was a gentile she had not took the Mark of the unbeliever but it kept herself in the time of famine right the prophet said she represents the Church of today Glory the prophet also said this woman was ordained to life righta brother Dar who is this woman my dear brother my sister it's you amen thank you Lord she was typing you for what did God say before the deathful day of the Lord behold I send who who you Elijah right the prophet God would have never sent a prophet to an immoral woman right I make the pope shout what's wrong with those message people am right think of it that make us the happiest people on earth I wasn't looking for God you say I sought God I could no you didn't you never sought God it was always God looking for you hallelujah amen hold I send you Elijah the prophet now the willow woman she goes to the meal Barrel I'm trying to Hur she goes to the meal Barrel there's not much left she goes over the cruise of allil just enough for one spoonful just a good tablespoon about all she had that's all stood between her and death now I suppose that not that was an all night prayer meeting and brother when things get to going wrong that's the time to pray right when everything's going good none of us pray like we should pray but let trouble strike your home one time you'll know how to pray come on somebody persecution is good for us tribulation is good for us we've ask God for peace and comfort but God gives us the best thing he can give us that's trials and tribulations they are better they're more precious to us than gold because through our trials and through our test there's a character molded in us that's fit to reain amen amen amen you see my brother my sister if we prayed about our problems instead of worrying about our problems how much better off we would be now isn't it strange that God will let us get right down to the end of the road and no doubt she checked up and checked her life said Lord God I I've served you I've done all I know to do I've met your requirement but let me say this afternoon friends you may be going through a great trial you may be going through a great test you may be facing a great battle with sickness or whatever it is but let me tell you this morning if you have met God's requirements then stand your ground what did what did Moses tell them stand still and see the salvation of the Lord amen when you done all you done to know to do ain't time to quit well everything's going wrong everybody's leaving the M I don't care if everybody leaves I ain't going nowhere amen just stand still it's not a time what do he say when these things come to pass why does it surprise us the prophet told us these things would happen the prophet said there would be a fallen away is that true friends remember when Jesus went to Gus's house and the little girl was dead what did they do when he got there who was he he was the manifested promise for the hour he was the word for that hour made flesh is that right Jesus Is God is that right he was God made flesh is that righten I know you believe that and she she stood there and what did they do he said she's not dead she sleep right you know what they did they found a problem with his message they found a problem with his message had they laughed him the scor the Bible said they made fun of him but you know what he did he put them out right and as soon as they went out yes sir they'll come a resurrection hello get ready friends have you ever seen an hour that everybody's talking about body change come on a man becomes a woman and call him a hero yeah hey man that's right you mean he knows more about himself than God does nonsense I said nonsense well that's not politically correct well I'm not in politics so it don't matter to me come on friends and you know that's the truth but look at the hour everybody's trying to change their body now if they're doing that out there what you Reon fixing to happen in here [Applause] amen I'm looking for a body change too but it's not my plastic surgeon amen it's my God Almighty himself if anybody asked you where I'm going where I'm going someday soon oh Hallelujah I'm going up yonder anybody going with me he man it's going home time don't get discouraged lift up your eyes amen amen I've met God's requirements the old fell wake up you I can just say mom I'm so hungry mama look see if I something to eat she know they wouldn't nothing to eat but she'd go to the cabinet and she'd fill around she'd come back say junior honey drink this water just drink this water it'll be better in the morning just hang on to the morning just hang on oh let me tell you the Bible says weeping may endure for the night weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning just hang on the day is far spin but hang on it's the rising of the sun it's the dawning of a new day couldn't sleep good he was hungry but she knew she' met God's requirement amen she knew she met all God's requirement yet God was still silent now watch it seemed like God didn't even care for her yeah right H it seemed like God didn't care whether she would live or die now how many times have we felt like that when we have a problem or we're facing difficulty and we call on God and call on God and call on God and it seems like God's silent it seems like God don't even your prayer goes right off your lips and falls on the floor and no doubt she'd sought God and sought God and it seemed like God didn't even care whether she lived or died yeah and one of Satan's greatest tools I hope you're listening to me one of Satan's greatest tools against us is to try to get us to believe that God don't love us right right we believe God loves brother Dale and God loves brother WG and God loves brother wg's wife but God don't love me right and Satan says that's right that's why you're facing this battle that's why you're facing this sickness that's why that's why your children's giving you such a hard time cuz God don't love you want Satan's greatest tools what did Brother B say brother B said Satan tried he couldn't come and tell me there wasn't a God because I met him but what he tried to come and tell me was yeah there's a God but God don't love you right now why did he do that because he knows it's effective it works on prophets it works on pastors it works on evangelist it works on mama daddy brother sister it works if he can get us to believe that our problems are greater than our God then the next thing you know we'll be muming and we'll be complaining and we'll quit coming to church and we'll set further in the back and we won't say Amen say Amen or out what amen I really do feel it h me praise God but it seemed like God didn't care whether she lived or died but all God don't miss this all the time God was working it out it wasn't that God didn't know God knew exactly what was taking place sometimes the old saying is we can't see the forest for the trees all she could see was the trees God was looking at the whole Forest amen let that be a lesson to us that many times we're having problems in our life issues in our life we think God is silent Lord I prayed I've heard nothing are you listening are you there but in reality God is working it out for our good amen write this down put it on your refrigerator remember this every Miracle starts with a problem right amen well brother I want a miracle in my life well you got to have a problem first every Miracle starts with a problem I say it humbly but I say it by the grace of God Jessica's testimony has Ren around the world right the last I heard over 40 50,000 people has watched her video amen I get calls all the time from different places for people was watching and God healed them just from watching the testimony but you see that come that only comes after the great tral right right did I have anything to do with it I had nothing to do with it I just happened to be standing there when it happened it was all God God was working the whole thing out God was oh God I was on an airplane the other day and a man sitting beside me and we got to talking you know and I I always promise God if you if you raise my daughter up I'll try to tell the world what you did for her so I tried to keep my promise and so I move the conversation over and I begin to tell him about Jessica and he goes I just saw that video yeah who could do that but God Amen but you see God don't always ask us to understand everything God don't I remember the night of the accident my wife she was so upset her father was killed her sister was eighty old she was killed her girl that she was dying they was fighting she's fighting for her life the news report come on little 2-year-old Jessica Ward fighting for her life tonight and we was there in the in a little room that they gave us and my wife you said I'm going to be sick and I wouldn't got a waist basket and I can see her in my M her hands were just shaking her whole body was shaking and she was crying and she was trying to throw up she said I don't understand it I don't understand why would God do us this way she said you're gone all the time you're never home you're always out preaching somewhere why would God do us this way and I remember Sam I just grabbed her hands I said sir listen to me listen to me I said I don't know I don't know why it's happened but you see sometimes God don't ask us to understand he just ask us to trust him rightly amen like the person said well I trusted God till the rains broke oh God that's the time to trust him is when the rains break am amen amen it looked like God was silent it looked like God didn't care but God done told Elijah God had done D up the brook amen he's told Elijah I have commanded a widow woman to feed you he had all already commanded her but guess what she didn't even know it exactly that's right she was unconscious oh God don't miss this she was unconscious of the fact that everything she was fixing to do was ordained of God by a Divine act right she prayed all night long she believed somehow God would do something she gets up in the morning she knows what she's going to do so I'm get me a little cake I'm going to fix it I'm going to I'm going to get me some sticks I'm going to make a fire I'm going to make a little cake and I'm going to set Junior on my lap and and I'm going to say junior I want you to eat this cake he said mama ain't you hungry I'm

cake give it to your son going tell him I'm not hungry honey you eat it and wait for death yeah I remember friends it's always in the darkest hour is when God moves the greatest amen oh brother Dar understand my trials I don't understand this Dark Hour It's My Darkest Hour brother darl I'm going through such a horrible trial I'm going through such a dark time you know what I say thank God CU it's those times that God always moves the greatest Glory brother Dar I'm I'm at my wit's in what am I going to do start expecting the miracle start expecting God to come on Friends start expecting God to do something that's God's pattern of the word when did God show up on the sea when the clouds got dark and the first drop of rain fell no when the boat was about sunk and the winds was blowing and the boat was tossed everywhere it was their Darkest Hour that Jesus come walking on the water when the woman with the blood issue when did Jesus show up not the first day she went to the doctor with the blood issue but after the doctor had took all her money took all our insurance then he said I can't help you well why didn't you tell her that at the first but after she'd spent all of her money on the doctors yeah then they said I can't help you but when the doctor says I can't help you Jesus says I can when did he show up it was at her Darkest Hour when all hope was gone when did he show up at gyus his house not when she got sick no but when death it took the child is that right friends little did she know up on the hillside Elijah was by the Brook God had done D up the brook he was sending him to feed her to sustain her amen he saw Vision no doubt he saw a little fence a little tree or something like that said go down to the widow woman's house I have commanded her by a Divine act I have ordained her to sustain you how do you know friends I don't know hardly any of you you don't know me probably some of the first time you ever saw me but God put us here this evening

down the road and no doubt he's singing I'm one of them I'm I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and he's walking down the road here's this widow woman she goes out by the gate looking for sticks because they got to be right it just can't be any kind of stick it's got to be the right stick so she's looking for sticks and she's singing I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and Elijah's coming down the road he's singing I'm one of them oh let me tell you something friends when two one of thems meet when two one of them me it's the fourth of July it's fireworks Kaboom hallelujah what happens with two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together something's got to shake something's got to take place amen hallelujah said I'm going to give me two sticks I want to make a fire so she's out there with her back and she's looking for the sticks and he walks right up to the gate he says something like this good evening friends and there's just something about that voice right right how many knows what I'm talking about Glory I was 5y old the first time I ever heard it didn't understand it but there was something about that voice my mom and daddy backl the Lord and took me out of church you parents don't do that I don't understand they'll keep their kids in church when they're little about the time they get seven or eight year old they backslide on God and go out and the kids just go crazy don't do your kids that way and then they try to come back in try to bring their kids back in line after they went out there and tasted all that yeah right that's what my parents did to me I wasn't in church from the time I was like nine until I was 21 and I was in the Army and I stationed at Fort Brag it's just about 6 hours away and I used to come home on the weekends and I'm ashamed to tell you but I was used to drive out of town listening to a group called White Snake something black snake red some kind of snake there's a song called train training I used to put that song on crank it up and drive through Johnson City like a maniac heading back to the Army and I used to go right by Happy Valley see him up there on the steps yeah little did I know and just a few years later Lord will let me preach to him and I went right by and I went remember one time I went over into North Carolina boo North Carolina listening to rock and roll music and all of a sudden the radio faded out and brother brenon faded in yeah started preaching and I listened to it all the way through up to Winston Salem and it faded back out because there's something about that voice it calls to you you ought to be the happiest person on Earth amen so he says to her bring me a drink now watch he's asking for water now she's got more water than she's got food right exactly right so she turns to get the water why cuz she's a character you know she she's character like Elijah she's a she's a she's a server she's a giver amen and so he she know he's a nice nice man the nice voice there so I'll give you some water after all you know what am I'm going to need water for I ain't got no more food this is it so she goes and turns to get the water and then he says and bring me a little cake right now he's not asking for her water that's right he's asking her for everything she has this day I will give my all he's asking her to give now watch if it had just been the kind of character of a woman she was if it would had just been her no doubt she would say well I'll split the cake with you or I'll give it to you but you see she was going to give that to her son right and we all know how much we'll take care of our children we'll suffer everything for our children is that right so he wasn't asking her to give something she's going to eat herself he was asking her to give him something she was going to give her son right exactly right but you see God never ask you for something but what he's got something better for for you ain't that something glory god just asked us to come to church three times a week pay our ties live right yeah y'all do have church three time however many times you have church I don't know you know what I'm saying he says and bring me a cake now he's asking her brother for everything she has right and when he sees that she is going to get it right right when he sees she's willing to give him that cake she heard the words that every believer longs to hear thus saith the Lord bring me one now and go make one for your son and go make one for you and go make another one for your son make another one for you and bring me another one and then go make two for your son make two for you and make go ahead and make me three and then go back and make six more for you and make six more for your son and I believe I'll have eight more after that Hallelujah are you crazy Elijah no sir thus sayth the Lord the mbar will not go empty or the oil will not dry up Hallelujah every time there WI a woman that was ordained to life every time she went to that barrel of meal there was meal in the barrel and there was all in the cruise but you see she had to empty out first the more she empty out the more that came back well we come to church too full yeah especially in the 2:00 service we come too full but how we need to empty out when we come in and the more I can empty out the more God can fill me amen you see God must have first place he must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything you do or what you are God must be first he doesn't want second place God does not deserve second place he deserves our best our best amen our best hallelujah our best song come on somebody he deserves our best everything that we've got he deserves it but you see God will take second place he'll take third place he'll take fourth place he'll take last place he'll take whatever place you'll give him right but he deserves first place as soon as she Ed it out and gave it to Elijah it was just as though she gave it to God Amen what you've done into the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me I can I have just a few more minutes she stayed under the word of Elijah as long as she stayed under the word of Elijah there was food in due season sir notice there wasn't meal in never Barrel there's all kinds of barrels in the city there was all kinds of barrels in the city but there's only one barrel that place was drying up there was a famine in the land people were hungry people were thirsty but not at her house right she had spiritual food in due season right there was all kinds of barrels but only hers have the blessing of Elijah on it I don't know about you but if I lived in Georgia I would find me a place to go that has the blessing of Elijah upon it God had provided a meal Barrow to sustain life he's done the same for us today whatever you have need of just reach in the barrel Glory if we can grab the reality of the fact that he's the same and let God operate on our faith take everything away and we wake up to the fact to know that he's the same yesterday today and forever we'll have perfect Faith to work on throughout the coming week why perfect Faith Masters every circumstance you don't need to go running here and there well I saw this on Facebook forget about it well I saw this on YouTube that's the problem it's YouTube huh stay away from that huh stay away from those meal there's no life there need to spend their time looking for another meal Barrel we just need to stay with the one God's provided for us in the evening time Elijah restores all things it was in the evening time that this meal Barrel the end of everything she knew everything was running out it was at that end time that Elijah came with a restoration message and restored the meal Barrel to her that would sustain her in the time of fam do you love him like down in Egypt they were feeding on the lamb God provided for them just before their Exodus God provided for them a lamb right he said don't add anything to it don't put Dale Seasoning to it you know don't put Daryl seasoning to it just take it the way God
