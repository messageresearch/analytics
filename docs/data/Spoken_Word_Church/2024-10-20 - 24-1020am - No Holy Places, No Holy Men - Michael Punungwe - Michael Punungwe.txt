TRANSCRIPT
========================================
morning God bless you it's good to be here with you if you have your Bibles let's turn to James chapter 2 verse 21 if we could just bow our heads father Lord we thank you for this day Lord thank you for allowing us just to gather here Lord just under your roof Lord and just know that when we gather Lord that your presence will be here Lord that you'll touch every heart and every mind Lord pray for those who are out and traveling or can't be here Lord just touch every body touch every need Lord and Reveal Your word to us help us get closer to you Lord and get a Fuller and and more developed revelation of who you are in the person name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen amen so James chapter 2: 21 was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar if we could let's turn to Genesis CH 22 22:1 15 and talks about the sacrifice that AB Abraham made and he says and the angel of the Lord this is after you know he he went in faith to sacrifice his son and then the Lord provided a lamb and this is this is the the after effects of that in verse 15 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon this Seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice so I've kind of been teaching uh James to my students and and this is part of James is is a very I feel is a very demanding book it it Demands a lot from you you know it it builds on your faith but it all says we can't just have faith you must also have works and and with those works you know he's saying that's in James is talking about Abraham and how he was justified by works when he offered his son to be sacrificed and as the scripture says you know it is it was because Abraham obeyed is why God blessed him and and so there so we can see there there's a causal relationship between obedience and blessings and because that that obedience you know that that's where that's where the blessings came from so if you're looking for something in your life to correct if you're wondering you know what's going on why why am I you know may sometimes you get short tempered or sometimes you get upet about things maybe you need to look in the word and see if you're really obeying the scriptures maybe you need to analyze and examine your life and see if that obedience to the word is there because if you're out of obedience then you will suffer the consequences you will stray further and you're going to notice it in your life at work in your home you're going to notice those things but there's a causal relationship between obedience and blessings and it's good to remember that you go back to James chapter 2 verse 22 see is thou how Faith wrought with his works and by his works with was Faith made perfect so Faith can't be made perfect without works you know we have to have both faiths and works we can believe and we can say you know God knows my heart and and God sees the hearts of man but the heart your heart will be expressed on the outside that's why we say that inside man is going to work its way out and you're going to display those at just not going to you're not going to you know hide your light under a bushel but it's going to shine and people are going to see it and it's not going to be something that's hidden or you're not not not a secret Christian but it's going to be something that that everyone knows that everyone can see through your life through the way you speak through the things things you say through the things you don't say through the places you don't go the things you do they're going to they're going to be able to tell what what type of life you're living in verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God now that's a wonderful thing to be called a friend of God so when we look at like so a lot of you know sometimes people think that the Bible is a book of rules it's dos and don'ts and then and they're lacking that that relationship with God they're lacking that friendship with God to be considered a friend of God and it's it's not just about do this or do that but it's truly about knowing who God is and and if everyone just get the desire to know who God is and know what God wants and to consider what God wants in your life consider what God considers righteous you know sometimes we just go through our lives and we we think things are supposed to be done a certain way based on how we were raised or the country we grew up in or or or different things like that but if we consider what does God think about this and we get a lot further and we we we tribute a lot nicer to each other for sure um verse 24 ye seen then how that by works man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also so was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way and it's such an interesting thing that cuz you know sometimes people try to get very legalistic and in the dos and don'ts but we see that Rahab when when she she hid the spies that was illegal that was against the law and then she lied to the spies lied to the people who were looking for them and told them to go away now we don't believe in lying but God we know that God under is understanding God he understands context he understands you know what Rahab did there was not of evil thing but it it was actually good and it was for the service of Israel so that they could you know get an advantage against the amalekites who were seeking to destroy them so so God understands the context and he understands that you know when there are these rules when the law is there but we have to look at the Spirit of the law to see what what the law is actually there for you know and Jesus that's why Jesus when was here he said you know uh man wasn't made for the Sabbath the Sabbath was made for man so it's not that you know I mean and and he healed someone on the Sabbath and they just thought oh how could you do this on the Sabbath you know and and he's like well man isn't made for the Sabbath the Sabbath is made to serve man it's not that man is is just to be fod for the Sabbath and that you know if someone has a need we just let it go under the table because you know we need to uphold the laws and traditions but it's truly that God is trying to help people God loves people and he he wants to heal people he wants to to those needs and he understands you know if there's something like if someone's sick and they can't make it to church or or something's going on in someone's life he understands those things it's not just about the law the law the law but it's truly God has an understanding and that's why even though we see when Rahab even even technically she did something that was illegal and she lied that actually saved her and her family cuz God understands that he's not an unfeeling uncompromising he he understands context he understands different situations that's why he know that's why he knows that if if you're cow stuck in a ditch he's not going to strike you down for that he understands the context behind those things and and it's and sometimes people tend to forget that you know and they just kind of enforce the law enforce the law but there's there's feeling behind the law there's love behind the law the the reason why the law was made was to serve man not not that man should serve the law and and just be unfeeling and not care if someone has a need or or something they're going through to to always be mindful of those things and verse 26 for the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also and we'll go on to chapter 3 verse one my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation so master in this context uh more so means a teacher and and this idea that that John is talking about that you know those who are Masters those who are teachers those who are or perhaps a leader or have a position in the church they shall receive the greater condemnation because there's a greater responsibility on these people this this idea is is collo colloquially expressed as with great power comes great responsibility many people have heard that phrase but that's kind of maybe a modern uh interpretation of it but it's it's those who have a more power you know need to wield that power correctly because we know that power power apart from character is satanic so when when someone is given a position a role in the church or a role in anywhere they need to have a certain Integrity or character about them to so that they can reinforce the law or or whatever their their their job is in accordance with you know what God wants in accordance with righteousness essentially yes because you must have character in order to wield power and and you'll be more responsible for for what the things you say and the things you do if you have a position if you've been given authority over people and and unlike you know in the world it seems like the higher up you go in power the more people you're in charge of and the more people you have to kind of you know point and they have to go a certain way but in the Christian hierarchy the more the higher up you go the more of a servant you are even Jesus said you know the greatest among you will be your servant you know and there's things that maybe uh we could do that maybe brother Wade couldn't do he couldn't just go go somewhere and not tell us where he's going or and then we come to church and we don't know where our Pastor is and where everyone's looking around and everyone's kind of getting uh you know flustered or hot and they're wondering what's going on where's you know he he has to tell us these things he has to you know he has to be here at church or if he's not here he has to tell somebody and communicate with us or if someone's you know needing some type of counseling or help and the scripture says that you can go to wise counsel and he has to kind of be there for those needs and there's certain duties that he has to fulfill that maybe a regular congregation member wouldn't have to fulfill they can just go home and or they can just go another the church and not tell anybody but brother way can't just up and leave one day and say well I'm going to this church and y'all have fun over here but no he he has to communicate these things and and and and it's a it's a service that has to be done Hey Brother the way it's a service it really is it really is a service uh to us and to the congregation and and to any congregation that a pastor might reside over or any Deacon or Minister you know there there is a service being done there in the same way that Jesus you know the the epitome of of anything we could think of was a servant and he he submitted himself and he he died upon a cross and and it's also important to know that Masters or teachers you know they they they receive the greater condemnation but it doesn't mean that other people don't have a a Ministry you know and that's that's kind of what people kind of get into this trap where like they kind of want they want a position they want to do something they want to have some type of influence you know and they kind of seek that position out because they they want that and and well first off that's the wrong attitude to have going into that position but also it's not that if you're not a master or a teacher of some sort that you're not important or valuable or have a Ministry you know cuz and that's where brother brandom the brothers can pull up that quote brother Bram talks about this and how go he goes over the Catholic church and how they kind of say the lady doesn't have anything to say or the people you know don't have a Ministry but he talks about how God is an individual ual God and he can give his Spirit individually to different people and maybe someone who never preaches or never gets off find the pulpit can just say something to you that could that could bless your life and it could just it could change your life and they might never ever preach but you'll know what they did for you and God God will use them in that way and the brothers could pull up the quote yes that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy declare the leoty has no word to say each one has something to say each has a work each has a Ministry the Holy Ghost came at Pentecost and separated himself on each he separated he separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled whereof Christ said at the day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you John 14:20 The Great I Am the almighty God has come as a spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men amongst us but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is he the holy spirit that is Holy not the congregation itself you know and and and it's such a a powerful quote and and and sometimes we can see some of those that's maybe one of the bigger issues in in this message perhaps is that some people try to deify brother brandom and make him a holy man and they lift his name and that's why you sometimes when you go to some places like uh Indiana or Arizona there sometimes there's some strange things going on because people think that those places are special because the prophet lived there and oh there there's something special about this place because you know he was here but Holiness is not about the place or the person but it's about the spirit it's wherever the spirit resides is where it's holy cuz this this is just a building but when we get Believers here when we know people who who understand the message who have a desire for God and we gather and and we and we come looking to praise God looking to to glean something from the Lord to see what the God would have for us to do in our lives that then then it brings his Spirit Here and Now becomes holy that that that's where the anointing comes from you know I mean we we could all go to Israel and we could stand where Jesus stood and it wouldn't get us any closer you know to his spirit and to who he is any closer of an understanding it wouldn't make us any Holier you know we're not you know Muslims who have to take a trip to the Mecca in once in their life just to to to fulfill that scripture or or or the Quran but we we understand that God can come to us wherever we go you know if we have God living in us then he'll he'll go wherever we go he'll go with us and he won't forsake us that's right so that's when the that that's where the Holiness comes from it's not from any any work or action or or or place or person but it's the spirit that dwells just same with Pentecost there's nothing special about the upper room but when the right Mighty rushing wind came through then there was something special about it and there's something special about those people so and and you just think about the burning bush you know when Moses was just he was just taking care of sheep and you know 30 minutes ago it was a bush but then the Holy Spirit comes down and then there's a fire and then but the bush isn't consumed and then he speaks to Moses through that bush but before that it was just a bush but when the angel of the Lord be came then it was Holy Ground And it to take off his shoes but there's nothing different about the dirt it was just the spirit that was there so don't get obsessed with a church or a person or a place it's just dirt but if the spirit could come down then we have that's where the power is so we're always looking for that Spirit not looking for any anything fancy not looking to be entertained but simply looking for the spirit of the Lord to be where we are and you brother Brandon you know emphasized how he emphasized how anytime he was he was on the pulpit he was looking for the guidance of the spirit and especially in prayer lines you would see he was he would he would kind of wait and and he would say things like well just put your head down or you know be reverent and just you know how many believes how many believes the Lord is true and then and he just kind of say things like that and he's kind of he's kind of stalling and and and one time he addresses that comment and he says brother BR you might say said uh congregation like you might say I'm stalling and you'd be absolutely right cuz I'm waiting for the spirit I'm waiting for this without the spirit I'm completely helpless is what he said right and he he's he's waiting and he's kind of just taking his time and doesn't want to you know just jump into it you know cuz he he did that before where he tried to jump ahead of a vision and he tried to well this baby's going to get healed and I saw it in the vision but the vision it wasn't quite what he saw in the vision so he just tries to well I'll just pray for it now and and it'll get taken care of and it doesn't happen because you can't jump ahead of the vision he has to completely helpless without the spirit of the Lord so he he and he was always very cautious and very he he always approached it with trepidation and and humbleness and said well just just bow your heads and just hum that softly and you know we're waiting on the spirit and and he would and then when the spirit would anoint him then he could say oh you I saw you with a red shirt over there and you're praying for your mother and oh I saw you doing this and then and then he could discern those things of the spirit and and and see discern the things in the people's hearts When the Spirit came and aided him but it was never him himself he always gave credit to Christ and he was always waiting on the spirit of the Lord and if he was completely helpless by the spirit of the Lord then none of us are any different you know especially if he's the prophet then we all have to to wait and be gentle and and and and be humble and be be cautious of that timid Holy Spirit and make sure that we're not doing anything that would you know force it away or even when we come to church and make sure that you know maybe our phones are off and we're not we're not getting distracted by things outside of the world but we're really trying to focus in and enter into the service and not thinking about you know as humans oh we're so hungry or we're so we're so tired I didn't get enough sleep last night but just just try to enter into the service and truly try to catch the spirit of the Lord because when two or three are gathered his spirit is here so you have to you have to discern and you have to enter in you know it's going to be that spirit that that comes in and you you have to enter into that spirit cuz it's here it's by scripture it's here amen so if you don't feel it be reverent amen and wait for it and try to try to enter in now James 3:2 for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as per perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits on the horse's mouths that they obey us we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm whatsoever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a ma a matter a little fire kindleth so James has been talking about Works he's been talking about you know not just saying you believe something something but actually confessing it and and actually professing it with your actions and the things that you do and now he's he's speaking on maybe as he would say the maybe the hardest thing to tame you know he later on says that no man can tame the tongue so he's saying that if you can Bridle your tongue and you can be perfect in your words then you can be perfect and it's really that simple but it's not it's easier said than done I suppose but it's for all of us to to watch the things we say and and he gives the example uh I love the examples he uses in this book he he talks about how a ship and and this this gigantic ship but this small Rudder determines where the ship goes and it can take the ship anywhere it wants to if there's just just a tiny Rudder the the part of the ship that actually determines the direction of the ship is not the largest part of the ship and we might think we might see the whole boat we might see the big thing but what's really what really holds the power is just that small Rudder and that's why that's why if you can just get to the controls you can just take control of the whole ship even your car it's just a little steering wheel that controls your entire car if you can get to that steering wheel you can control the entire car and the same is with your tongue if you can get to your tongue if you can tame your tongue if you can Bridle your tongue you can you can take control of your whole spiritual life and you can it'll really change your life we know the power of words we know we know that God uses that he speaks things into existence and that his you know his thoughts aren't like our thoughts and when he speaks you know it is it is so it's not that it's not a matter of opinion it's not a matter of you know what somebody thinks but when God speaks it is truth and he even talks about how he talks about the ship again at the helm but it goes where whatever the governor listeth now you think of the power of perhaps someone of of a political office a prime minister a president a dictator whatever the case may be that the entire nation could gather around one man and if he says something the whole country is a war if he says something you know the whole country goes to invade another one or or whatever he says and and it's just the Power of One Man's Tongue you know if if the nuclear bombs drop it's going to be the decisions of a a small group of men so it's the same with our tongue the the power and the destruction and and all the things that that could transpire transpire could be a result of us not being able to control our tongues so that that's that's the power that a tongue holds and that's why the Bible says it's better to to do and not vow than if you were to vow and not do so if you're if you're unsure about something no just don't make any commitments don't put your foot down on anything but just maybe sometimes just be patient or say well I'm not sure and then you know it's better to say I'm not sure and then be able to do it than to say you're going to do it and then not show up for it is what the scripture has said CU once you made a vow you can't undo the vow you know and the same is true of anything you say you know people get into arguments you know you can't you can't you can apologize but you can't you can't take those words back you know that's why it's good to be slow to wrath and slow to speak and sometimes maybe if you're upset you know just go for a walk or or do something else but you know I mean Wars have started over words relationships are ended over words you know people families are torn apart over words and people get upset they get hot they get emotional and they say things they don't mean and even if you don't mean it you know the consequences will still be there so go for a walk Amen in verse six and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of the nature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of Beast of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith we bless God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be so just talking here on the perhaps The Duality of Man and and James talks about this a lot I mean he's talking about faith faith and works so of course he going to have to talk about the duality of man and he talks about earlier in chapter one he says the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and all these different things where where you know and even I mean even in Romans you know it's talking about how you're trying to do right but your flesh is Waring against you and all these things and and and now James is talking about how the tame is so it's an unruly evil and it's so hard to tame and and we shouldn't you know curse and bless out of the same mouth but yet we do and that's why we need the grace of God and we need we need his guidance we need his help on everything but we need that's why we need to Bridle our tongues because you know when we come here to praise the lord we can't then go out and then you know say things we shouldn't say or curse or or swear or those different things or even just say hateful words towards one another about somebody else but everything that should come out of our tongue should be holy it should be yay yay or NE neigh it should not be no confusion or or any of anything things like that in verse 11 do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear allive berries either of Vine fig so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh water and I love that example the Bible uses of of the vines and the figs and and and and we know where the random uses the cuab barel and and and the seeds and those examples where you know what's put in the ground you'll know what it is when it grows up and it and brings forth fruit so if we're to be Christians if we're to have this Faith you know we can't be respected of persons we can't we can't be giving a contradiction we you can't put a a grape seed in the ground and then you know apples grow up that's not it's not how it going to work if if that life is in you it's just going to produce that exact thing so we can't we can't have fresh water and salt water we can't those things can't mix so we have to purify ourselves and read the scriptures and and obey God and seek that that that friendship with God that Abraham had and to seek those blessings through obedience and through the the the genuine desire to follow his word that comes from the heart of men and in verse 14 but if you have bitter envying or verse 13 sorry who was a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shoot out of a good conversation his works with weekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work so he's once again speaking here against people who maybe they they feel like they have more knowledge or or wisdom than somebody and and they they try to use that to to exalt themselves or or give themselves a position or or even so as in verse one we're saying you know be not many Masters because we shouldn't all be Masters we shouldn't all be teachers but but some people he's kind of going back to that idea that that wisdom there's a certain way that wisdom expresses itself and it's not in a selfish or boastful way the same way that the uh the greatest should be the servant but some but as he talks about Jesus talked about you know there are some people who just seek that title they seek that representation that they want to be called Master they want to be called Rabbi and James is touching on that idea where people who who who have they might have a form of wisdom but the way they express it would be wrong and that's why he says it descendeth not from above it is Earthly sensual and devilish and that's why brother brandom said that apart from character apart from character power is is satanic and 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace God bless you [Applause]
