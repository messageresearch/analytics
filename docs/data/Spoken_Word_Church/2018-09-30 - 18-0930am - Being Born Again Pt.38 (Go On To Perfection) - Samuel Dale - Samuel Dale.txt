another with a pure heart fervently being born again now how are you born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible but what now by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever so what is the new birth birth of the word right the pure word brother Branham said false prophets brain false verse he said true prophets brings true bears the birth of the word ok and now we go to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue are now where we call to we're called to total glorification in total part of in bringing the virtues into being we're by are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen you may be seated the Lord having his blessing blessing upon the word now we've got some questions so if anything that you have a question or thought in your mind while we're trying to we'll review just a little to kind of line up things and then we have a few questions to try to cover upon what we've been speaking on right now and if you have anything just just raise your hand one of the Deacons or somebody will come and get it and write it down and just say what do you mean that's all right with me I don't have to have a whole lot of doing I just have a weak mind anyway so I can only handle parts of it so you know just speak whatever you say and you say this what do you mean by this and I'll try to explain it right now we know for a surety we've been teaching the message of the stature of a perfect man all right and then that statue of a perfect man is the most wonderful situation that could ever be thought of in mankind see we as the people of the the end time we had our own ideas and thoughts and and stuff like that and we basically just you know we're close to a Baptist thought that you get everything when you believe and that's the way most people think you know think what do you get borned again and when you get born again you just got everything well that's not true you have a wonderful start you have a great blessings but when a baby is naturally born into the world it has all of the parts and things outside of some abnormality growing you know everything is dire but it's not into development to where it can be used properly you know as we say you don't you don't give you five year old or three year old or eight year old or 16 year old the key to the car you know you kind of keep it a little more reserved to make sure you know that you don't want them to running all over the place and messing up everything alright but yet still we believe in a growth development alright and that's what we've been teaching of the statue of a perfect man and I believe that's what Peter is explaining there in Chapter one as we kept reading see being born again and it's by the Word of God and that is the new birth all right so when the Prophet says statue of a perfect man he said how faith and be born again all right but now that doesn't give you everything because that's where he told the Pentecostal people well he said that's where you made your mistake he said you thought you got everything but said you only come to the point of getting the new birth or into the body of Christ and amen for getting into the body of Christ amen for the new birth because it is the the birth of the word it is eternal life in your soul all right that's wonderful and we thank God for that right but it's not the finished product there's a lot in the word is this keeping on going see and and as Peter says in first Peter being born again means something going on in a process that is within your life all right and then we get an over to second Peter he's explaining how that takes place and he says the Prophet says you're born again at faith he said that's the new birth faith in God he said everything we get is based upon faith all right the foundation of all things is faith faith is the beginning of our experience that is the beginning of our new birth the faith that we receive all right then Peter says to add to that faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and all and it comes out to build in the stature of a perfect man and I've tried to explain that for 50 almost 50 years to you because that's what I believe that we must grow into these things and it's in the statute of perfect Manny's brother Brennan said the church that has these things is what's going in the rapture these verses he said any individual that has these things is what's going in the rapture all right you said well what about some of those down through time who didn't receive it don't worry about that if they're truly born again they're in the body of Christ that's the key to the whole thing all right but they without us Hebrews 11 40 says they're waiting on you and I to bring them bring it to a place of a change of the body because this is the end time and this is for you and I all right see then God sent us a message to were that we could understand these things they took the Prophet he said statue of perfect man he said 30 years to preach that Allah he was trying to bring it you can go back in the early ministries and hear him talk about growth development adoption Jiri him the many different avenues that are reached to try to describe the statue of a perfect man or the growth of a Christian in Christ all right and see then what we've we've laid it over and over together but run said Paul and Peter preached the same thing all right now so then Paul doesn't use 2nd Peter he doesn't talk about add to your faith virtue no he doesn't cool that away but he goes with the adoption or form incurring it into showing adoption as were you adopt God adopts his own children see we in the natural you you adopt your own children that's that's not the days of now adoption so much but you adopt your own children after they reach an age of a kind of an age of of to where they can that big old bar that I miss but that words are you know for showing that they've reached a dull adulthood and in that they can be adopted or trusted and given the things to wear that they can be trusted you know and it was wonderful to be there in Israel when we actually got to view one of those outside on one of the corners that we were standing on kind of waiting on something else and we got to view that you know and it's wonderful all right let's see didn't we believe that the new birth brings you the eternal life but it doesn't finish the journey that's why Peter says being born again something's going on in our lives and they took the prophets message to bring that we believe the disciples were bringing these things as I said Peter preaching the statute of perfect man Paul preaching adoption all of it interrelates together to show the growth development of a Christian and bringing us to the place to word that we'll eventually somebody's going to come to a change of the body and you go through the book of Romans 8 then you get that word that you can cover that you're born again you know and making us children of God then waiting for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God to come forth all right then you come down to the last part in in Romans where it's all about to wit to understand the redemption of the body this age is to come to those things all right we've tried to bring those things out into an open to where we can follow what the Prophet is bringing unto us and he says that without these virtues you can become just a stumbling block with your gifts and your doing and stuff like that can be this a stumbling block a statue of a perfect man they because it if it's not handled correctly gifts can become damaging to you because you use them wrong all right so we we want to growth development and as I said we want the part of work that these bodies are to be changed what is the last thing there's only one thing to be brought in the last days and that's the change of these bodies right because everything else is into manifestation all right everything else has been brought forth but we get to read some of these bodies all right now in that sea then we come to studying the message as to seeing that it's laying there right in the message the things that you and I have need of all right it's in the stature of a perfect man because it shows that you go from fake to virture to knowledge temperance patience see and then you drop right on over in the scripture and you get up you know work speaks of the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness etc those are the things just in other word ins has to be used of a statue of a perfect man like I said the Prophet said he was thirty something years and preaching that no he said I've tried to have patience with the Branham tavern I call he said because that's where he's you know he was trying to bring that to us because he that was what was lost you can credit the statue of a perfect man or the growth development pretty well over to about the fourth church age all right because you got your your Martin and Columba and all of those coming in that was teaching the correct way so you can follow the statue of a perfect man or the growth development up to about the fourth church age all right but then it died went into the ground it was not the Spirit of God that went into the ground it was the growth development or understanding of the word of God that was taken away see they begin to denominator begin to die and fall away as they did then Luther comes forth with his just shall live by faith Wesley sanctification then Pentecostals with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that only brings you back to the position the word that you can start the growth development you know like weights bringing out in the seals and the thing see you've got Reformation down to a lot of that because it's reform and we won't get there this afternoon but I mean this morning but we'll we'll try to bring it on out later I'm talking about carnal reform alright but you see I'm just giving you a Feist run then back up to the questions all right that the new birth gives us eternal life but it's not finished no more than a baby's finished when it's born it has the growth development you must feed it and okay so we must take in the word and let the word come out the disciples now they heard the word for three and a half years they were taught the Word of God for three and a half years they actually heard Jesus in Matthew 24 as he spoke of the seals didn't understand it but they heard it they heard the teachings of the Lord Jesus all right they got on over to John we're even after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost they still didn't get it right to her brother run said that was a promise to come on to their penticoff now that's questions and answers we can give you these quotes because they didn't get the Holy Ghost go Jesus Christ had not come back he was there with them you know at the resurrection and the things and open to it and he opened even in the Book of Luke there's two times that he opened their understanding of the Scriptures so my point of what I'm getting at those disciples had three and a half years of tutoring and training and all and could question the Lord Jesus and did about what he was saying and what he was teaching and when they were born again they were born again in a great position because they were born as newborn babes in Christ yeah but that christ development because of the opening of the word placed them positionally in the body of christ but Aaron said the disciples had these virtues but they did now the headstone no that's what he says so we're not gonna argue and nobody about it was just quoting what he said he said they didn't have the headstone coat it hadn't come yet all right see it was to come in the in town and that's where we get to where we're at here in the lives all right we see the disciples they heard the word and when the Holy Ghost fell in the Upper Room there was only 120 and I've always said to you the Bible says he was seen of what were 500 brethren I have through his resurrection where's the rest of them they didn't fit the bill right they wasn't capable of going to the upper room well because they hadn't been tutored and trained or something was wrong and yet after even seeing him I through his resurrection they never thought it worthy to go to the upper room but 121 all right but then they come out from the upper room and when they do Peter preaches a message there in acts 2 to try to show those people what has taken place this is that that was spoken off all right and when it does then the Holy Ghost falls on 3,000 all right but remember that 3,000 had just heard one sermon all right so you can't say they were born as the others were because they never had to the opening of the word but they did receive the new birth and it made them babes in Christ desiring the sincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby made of newborn babies but it made them babies that needed to grope development then Peter writes our teachers here in his message how for them to come to her 120 we'd say was this a growth development because they knew how to teach it you don't you know novice don't write the word then you don't do that you don't put a novice out to write the word you put one that's do it and that's what I've always tried to get you to see Adam and Eve wouldn't babies and grow it up so when the church started on the day of Pentecost it started with them in full-grown not babies but they were to teach others how to get to where they were that's the main thing what profit come to do them God opened the word to the profit showed him what was missing Luther nominate Luther taught the new birth Wesley taught the new birth may have just been in may have been parts or whatever you call or something but it was still taught Azusa Street talked the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then the Prophet came to restore what would be called the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers is a revelation of the father so it took him 30 something years to be able to preach the faith of the fathers yet we think oh we got it all and brother Brown said our problem is why too many one full vessels come on you need the quote he said not a lot of empty vessels too many full vessels see what I got it all I got it all yeah yeah so you can't teach me cuz I got it out I got it where'd you get it that's as plain as I can say where'd you get it see the Prophet came then to restore the faith of the father's right was that his message to turn arts of the children back to the faith of the father's all right bring in the revelation of these things as I said a minute ago he told the Pentecostal he said that's where you made you mistake thinking you had everything he said you say ladder a ladder a ladder right he said you had to form a reign yet what was the former run his message of the teaching of the statue of a perfect land to try to turn us back to the faith of the fathers is the former rain latter rain is harvest rain are quickening to show that he taught it correctly God carries him on through the opening of the word into the seals that Jesus preached in Matthew 24 but no one knew anything about see he goes on and it proved that he did have those things like the disciples had got one because the Bible said were built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone so we're built upon what the Apostles taught and see they never had no false doctrine or idea they were true prophets true prophets as I quoted I'm in the Goethe prophecy true prophets bring troopers false prophets bring folks birth so you see that's where the troubles that you see what's taking place now you see where that all is these that followed the message so long stayed with it hollered and screamed about it brought a lot of us in to the message were the ones God used to do that thank God for them but now they're out there running on the field well brother Brown was wrong here he's wrong here he was wrong though well if you can tell me brother Brown was wrong and short to me I need to follow you that's sensible I mean if you show me some of these brothers that can straighten brother branham out then we need to follow that I mean that's sensible but you ain't gonna find it oh you're gonna find a bunch of garbage cans that's swore by these things you know spent their whole life studying the message we were there now evidently they missed the statue of a perfect man this is truthful that I can say because by missing the statue of a perfect man the statue of a perfect man did how none of those doctors they wouldn't know two souls two Lords fought this out of the other no Holy Ghost doctor and you know River Jordans on they wouldn't know that in the Bible none of that's in there the true understanding is in of the one God the water baptism - no eternal hell's that the truth of the end was in the Bible waiting own to be brought by the Prophet - were that it would open the word of God to us to where we could study the message and see what we have need of instead of defaulting like I said he said these virtually the gifts without these virtues is a stumbling block stumble excuse me use the word stumble block if you're looking for stumbling you won't find it in your computer it's stumble block yeah but it's the same thing you'll saying it all right now listen to do that then we see that we need or we must have these things it's a requirement it's not a just that well maybe we need this maybe when he died he said the person with this the church with this would be the one that was going around he said the individual with these verses would be the one that would go in the rapture well the rapture is dependent upon this message being correct so when we believe that will so there's a lot of the people that smash it all in the screen that they believe it where are they now see it's not to just say the message is right it's whether or not the message is revealed to you whether or not it's revealed to me and you we want to worry about the message being right that ain't our Park our trouble our thoughts as to whether or not we believe the message still to be true and as I said what about those what about the preachers of this message they some of them for 40 years preach this message and now they're saying the Prophet was wrong didn't that something he said well I'll never fall for that you know what they said they'd never fall for that just remember only by the grace of God we'll keep you and I from falling for that right only the grace of God will keep us well I studied the message was so how they so as a lot of people studied this message that's what's going to make it so damaging when they do have to come through a judgment the day you know well are you trying to call it normally call down judgment what I call her own judgment I don't have anything to do we're calling you in the judgment you call yourself into judgment all right but you understand what I'm saying now see that's the point of the whole thing is to know that this message come to do what it was to do and has been delivered into our hands now for us to make it manifest for the profit to bring it thank God praise God we got it all right but that don't mean we have it it's when it's revealed to you and me and not just revealed to us but when it's made manifest through our hearts and our lives to these things we found a lot of things in the statue of a perfect man that were parts that were hard to follow sometimes you know like why would the Prophet say virtue he said now that's not just living a virgin life well he agreed with the virgin life but that was not what Peter was talking about I spent and I want to emphasize that and then we'll get to a question see we've got to take this is the point I've tried to make to you we've got to take what the Prophet said not what the natural words say the natural word of virtue means a virgin life you know physical virgin life all right but that that's not what he's talking about there the Prophet said he said not in this case if you read the statute for a man if you hadn't go on read it you'll find these statements I see a virgin life is to be a virtuous person of all things like I tried to cover it you can be a pure virgin man our woman because man has a virginity just as a woman does we don't teach that a lot the message but it's dire but see it's a virtuous life more than just a virgin you'd be a virgin of these meanings violence night what are the name Bonnie or Clyde what was her name Bonnie was he the one I never didn't know which was the man which was wrong she could have been a pure virgin I'm just killing anybody dropping that doesn't matter to her see that's not that's why it's not just to say certain words it's to take the way the Prophet brought that word then when you get on over to what we got on over to temperance this is showing a couple of things when you get the temperance when it's say the Prophet said that don't mean now I'm not drinking alcohol we'll see the natural word temperance means to not drink alcohol but he said not in this case he said it's the controlling of that temper and one hour I could part out of course I didn't like it cause it hits me when he said with that controlling that tongue temperance is talking about controlling the tongue you know what I don't want no problems like I said brother Jack Cole said and that lady said she wanted to lay her tongue on the altar he said this Pope it's only 14 feet man they I may in another room up here for your tongue what well I don't have no problem with my tongue what I do and I'm just gonna tell you you do too so that's tough we're gonna solve that problem you ain't lying the mean ain't lying to you we just be walking and try to pray I'm glad we've got in a coma that's the main thing is we got an atonement for taking care of an advocate all right now if we didn't have trouble why would we need an advocate if we've got everything sealed up package deal when we got born again why do we need an advocate why do we need being born again okay all right now to get to the point the end of this show that was kind of the lineup the color I don't want you to misunderstand me when I come through and and just drop in the message to try to pick up some questions and like I said if you've got a question let me know all right yeah this is question number one that wrote and said was they had two questions about what I've been preaching brother Branham said now remember the background or the statue of a perfect man he goes he doesn't tell the dream of sister Shepherd on the statue of a perfect man with some little time later he preached after preaching the statue of a perfect man sister Shepherds remembers her dream and she writes brother Branham her dream all right and that's in blasphemous names and he he takes her dream and it explains the stature of a perfect man from her dream all right and doing it from her dream see then he was expressing what was taking place as I said a minute ago we take words for what we want it to be or whatever the definition Webster gives that can't always be true you'd read in Webster may be born again would be this out of the other the Peter says being born again see we go to the Prophet to get the answer all right that's the only way you can answer any question is by way of the prophets message let him answer it all right I see you as I said and people don't follow me on what I try to say but even like the Bible the Bible the King James Version we have is a translation of translations there's a lot of your good news for modern men and different one that actually used more original background of the Greeks in the Hebrews than think then actually because the King James Version is not a translation they don't any any translator it doesn't matter what it is they don't translate by what they think at least they're not supposed to now you know what I'm saying about that because you get into good news for modern men different time they translate by what they think but that's not the way it's supposed to be a true translator is supposed to translate word for word they're not supposed to think out what they're doing they're supposed to translate that's why I like the King James he took so many different ones sixteen I think numbers may be awful he takes groups they did they took groups and they put them all in different rooms and as they did they gave them so many of writings and things and they told him said go in there and come out with something that all y'all can agree then they took them and compared them with each other with this group with this group in this group until they got it tour all the groups were bringing the same thing they didn't write it down as being from God that's why so translation out translations they took all of the translations put them out to him and gave it to him they take a check all of their doctrine went and they came out with what we call the King James alright I believe it's the right one now like I've told you the reason I do because it was one the Prophet used right it was the one he used now he read other translations right that's fine you know cuz he even said the lumps of translation is the closest could be now I'm honest to admit there's some things I can't put it exactly in the lungs that comes forth in the King James but that's alright I'm not arguing with him he's one said it was that's my understanding that's where I mess it up that's where I'm trying to translate it okay oh but I don't translate yeah just remember your mouth doesn't open and speak words unless your brain has said something so your brain this first it's gonna tell you what it's safe from you lives all right now so we get the point now see then we asked the Prophet what does this mean and he'd say so-and-so so-and-so all right we got to take what he says to be the answer to that all right let's think about it that said they said well we've had two questions said brother Branham said about the sister shepherds in the dream you know that she was a charitable person he said she opened her house two bums beggars and fed them he then said God accepted her foundation now I'm reading what they say now so she showed she had brotherly kindness is that why God accepted her foundation all right now remember first prophet what was the foundation that was accepted not her brotherly kindness that's enough paragraph 137 blasphemous names faith is the foundation of all things and brother Brennan says God accepted her foundation he accepted her faith her faith is her foundation he accepted her faith not her brotherly kindness that would have been in there because it's displaying you're seeing that but I'm just answering the question as the question is written me in other words did he accept her brother did he accept her her brother the kindness no see she may not have had the true meaning of brotherly kindness even though she was a great person wonderful do it a lot in their life all right but he accepted her foundation which was her faith her new birth right he accepted her new birth her foundation which was her faith a revelation of God so then the Prophet answered it that the foundation was her faith that was accepted then you go virtue or knowledge temperance patience then you keep climbing all right because we haven't really got in to a lot of brotherly kindness yet all right number two says you often quote brother Branham where he said that God wants to fill ever fiber of his church now here's the question apart it's come which I do I quote that a lot what brother Brennan said God wants to fill every fiber of our being in take us in the rapture all right yeah now is that the same as what your you talked about this morning 9:23 18 when you mentioned that the honey seals the whole pyramid as the headstone comes down all right now when the Prophet is saying that God wants to fill every fiber of our being that is the whole complete unit you know us as a unit all right that would mean everything it would mean the headstone would be present all right and see when you're coming up to to seeing brotherly kindness and and things like that being we taught it as the Prophet taught it on the blasphemous names all right What did he say he said the Holy Ghost remember the messenger was pouring the message in he said it boiled out all the trash but he said it run out he's going to had cracks in it he said then the messenger took honey and poured it into the rock box which I don't draw it here to be the eye but you'd have to put a little kind of a lip around or a flange as he called it you know - worth it when the honey was poured in its sealed and the honey is the seal of God the baptism when the Holy Ghost is your seal since why it's so hard when you try to express something if you don't express it in line people get the wrong idea the new birth is the seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth you receive that is the seal of God that seals you in all right within there's more to it because as each virtue is given unto you then God seals that virtue into you that's the part of your new birth so then you have the Prophet said he says you burped into this and this into this and then then how many births do we have brother Dale you have one new birth you have one new birth but there's many births just as it is in the Bible they had one filling of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but then the disciples met daily and different times and the Bible says that that Holy Ghost was our filling them new the new birth is the birth of the word but then you're being born again as that word that you receive all right so then as you receive it what are you doing all the way up when to the basis - were when they had unites with the body and I say that we're all respect because of what I believe the knew were I mean the headstone is because I believe it's the revealed word and if you can make anything else I'd like to see it because anything you'd say well that's this is that I won't say it's the birth of the word because that's what it's got to be a subversive the word let's see when God gives you faith which is the new birth then when he gives you virtue that actually is sealed within you knowledge is sealed within you the garden as' then brotherly kindness comes in the shoulders all right at that place the comments just runs out and seals the whole thing so you look we're brother kindness is even it comes right here and it's true baptism of the Holy Ghost this seals all of this all of it sealed in alright because that's part of it so then when it when the Holy Ghost comes down upon the body the sealing of the pyramid knee which will be the new birth finished that's why I always teach you that way I believe it the day we leave this world in a rapture you know what you can say I am born again I'm truly born again when we walk out of this world in a rapture why cause it'll prove it like I said about it do you think see there's people that teach brother Branham was wrong here oh he was wrong in his early ministry and right in his last day you showed me that in the Bible or show me that in the prophets message I put it out there let him come to you come to me contact me about it you can't do it cuz if he didn't have it right God ain't gonna do the rest right if he didn't have it right who's going correct him well we found him wrong here we found him wrong thought we found him yeah just remember the Prophet was the prophet of the age not me and you the message that he brought us that's why I was saying the way I did like he says on blasphemous night that sister in her dream she saw the pyramid and saw the thing and she saw somebody with water pouring it in the top which would have been up here you know right in here pouring it in and it run down bought out all the tribes the faith of the fathers that are trying to teach you the other day the faith of the fathers or to board out a lot of our tribes the new birth before we heard of the faith of the father's order took care of a lot of things I mean come on I come out of the Baptist Church I come out of a church in the Baptist Church that they wouldn't have a preacher married twice they had that much respect for the Word of God I didn't have to get born again to learn not to let the neighbors cow out that's what everybody thanks brother branham come to tell us what does he need to come tell hey come on sisters you didn't need this message to tell you it's wrong to cut your hair the Bible says it you didn't need to prophets message to do those things yeah we put it all on that because we want to make excuses don't make excuses with me they don't work face straight up there was a lot in our lives should have been taken care of before we ever heard of this message we were already in the Baptist Church not allowing our children to watch certain programs on TV what was in the Baptist Church we didn't take vacations to go somewhere and be gone from the church we was gonna go to church somewhere so you can use excuses for this that Elsa you say you throw at me no no we've got ways of taking care of things now we can do the best we can now I against taking vacations nobody see that's where you start saying things people only don't believe me they don't believe well you go ahead and do what you want to do but listen the question was in other words was that honey to fill every fiber it will be the honey cause the baptism when the Holy Ghost the new birth the simple new birth that you receive that is the baptism in the Holy Ghost then you cover the baptism of the Holy Ghost as these ended as each individual virtue being birthed into you nurse the baptism that's why brother Brandon what was a blasphemous night he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been so missed alt or incorrectly called as he said well because you just teaching it anything see then as it keeps coming down there will be a time when God will steal in his bride and there will be a group in the last days as it's never been before but there will be a group to be sealed in and then they'll walk off the earth group it will be a bride around the world won't be just Loula it would be a bride around the world that'll come to the place in the Word of God Wow see that's why it's so important then what we hear when the body is complete now this is my statement back when the body is complete finishing out with all of the virtues in the thing and the headstone coming to unite then you'll say every fiber of my being let's see how they brought around said he said they'll come suture on baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm perforated it he said they'll come such a baptism when the Holy Ghost they don't feel every fiber of our being you take us in the rapture I believe that's about as close as you'll get to it because that's what it'll do you said well you're looking for a baptism an old ago I look for one every day I enjoy the presence of God everyday what about you I mean anytime that I can feel his presence I'm certainly believing that's a good baptism I like that because I believe in many baptisms I believe in being born again which his own going on going on going on going yeah not just one thing well I'm satisfied one well that's all right I'm not my belly sticks out and rub the pulpit because I'm not satisfied with just eating a little bit I like to eat a whole lot and I like that in the Word of God I enjoy hearing the Word of God to wear that this keeps unfolding and bringing me to deeper thoughts because that's what it's supposed to be all right so then it will come a day that something will happen that when this message is completely sewn down around the world then there will be an anointing strike now quote the Prophet after the door of the Gentile church is closed God will unknown a church he said he'll do in one year what he did in 2000 tried to do but even though this is what I see that's where people don't want to he said but he's doing it now you realize every time that God reveals itself to you that he's letting you know how much he loves you that he's sealing you with his love that brotherly katrina said we ain't got far enough yet and brotherly kind that's where the brotherly kindness comes in door he just seals it in and that honey just seals the whole thing you don't love the presence of God I love it because it's wonderful okay all right then we got that one let's see we get on this other one okay now this other one because I don't mind it I enjoy a lot of times people like this one over here I mean they're they're stating what they think you're saying that's good I'm just making sure this like I said about the god accepted her foundation now he accepted her new burrows maybe he didn't accept her brotherly kindness because maybe she didn't have it yet she was a good person that's what we think brotherly kindness is being good thing that's just like virtue then we think well that's just being a virgin well there's a whole lot more goes to it there's a whole lot more goes to this brotherly continent because if you're gonna take it to be the honey that seals us in remember there is only one honey that's worth anything that's the baptism in the Holy Ghost that is the new birth there is your honey that you really want and that's what I love about honey all over the world all waiting them got into the bee business we found out a lot of time honey all over the world is the same what consistent season seventeen percent water content all over the world and I used to wonder how and what all these things doing you know and why there's so many bees it's got to be around it you realize that they've got to keep that hive inside at one constant temperature whether it's winter ninety degree whether it's wintertime or summertime yeah they cool in the summer and the heat in the winter and ain't that something now what happens there's the beat is he turning his wings this way and it called it to be hotter and he turns them back the other way called it to be colder I don't know ain't nothing it's just I don't understand it but it's doing it they got to keep that and you can't rob them completely you got to leave them enough honey enough for them to eat no other time it's just and they only live so long anyway so but it's wonderful because that's honey in the rock you remember what we talked about the other day and the Prophet that was what was so wonderful when I heard that see we always we read these things in the Bible we read about the honey in the bag and everything you know and how they put it on the rock and we knew the stories but we didn't have it figured out totally little David Eichner take that dose cheap get sick and he didn't just go grab the first rock right no he found the right one because he found two rock minerals and things he rubs it on it and that animal starts licking it that was wonderful because that's honey in a rock okay all right get on to the next so like I said a lot of times people to me and I enjoy that part of they'll state what they're saying as a question or stated as what they believe to see if what you gonna believe is are something that's no problem to me see yeah as you have taught it does seem right that the believers in the Upper Room whom the Holy Spirit come came would have the entire pyramid except a headstone or capstone of the pyramid all right now brother Branham said the disciples had these virtues but he said stacks were perfect man he said now they did not how the headstone they did not have the headstone that's what he says all right so then we got to leave it to that point all right so then the pyramid the disciples as I've covered our minute to go in the message trying to just lay down a little bit see I've always taught you that on the day of Pentecost brother Branham was like I said we were talking one time these two brothers and one of them got everything when he believed and the other one said we ain't got it all yet I said would y'all mind if I just stay in the middle I said cause I can't go with you that way and a can't go with you that away the old mind if we just stay in the middle and the question was is where Berta Brennan said he met people who received the baptism with the Holy Ghost just like the day of Pentecost both of them admitted that they didn't know what he's talking about I said well let me stay in the middle and let's just tie together I said then under their Pentecost you got two things you've got a hundred and twenty in the upper room that were tutored and trained by the Lord Jesus and when the Holy Ghost fell it could position them in the body of the growth development because they already had their understanding open of the scriptures in the Book of Luke they'd already been breathed on in the book of John that even after his resurrection Jesus breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost the Prophet I'm glad of that si called we'd read that and say look are they got the Holy Ghost no they didn't get the Holy Ghost he had to go away come back brother Brent said that was a promise he said just like you say my stripes I'm healed he said that's a promise all right so then see we take the prophets answer to know that it's greater than all of our thoughts could be as to giving us understanding all right see they had been tutored and trained for three and a half years and when the Holy Ghost fell it could seal in all of these things - right here where it says the Holy Spirit on the pyramid they had these things sealed in but they did now the headstone called a headstone hadn't come now the headstone was standing there but the headstone didn't come on that penticoff the headstones to come to life stays is to come in the last days the headstone do you not know that's your according to your prophet now all right well now listen I agree with that because that's what I believe that those disciples had heard the word it had been opened unto them of their understanding in Luke 2:22 I guess 21 22 or somewhere in Latin leister Luke as two times art it says he opened to them their understanding of the scriptures all right it doesn't mean that you get a revelation because your understanding is open that's where our problems that I will emphasize this while I'm on the point cuz that's hard to keep from preaching if we think because our understanding is open we get it that can be only one two disciples had without the baptism when the hold ago I used to go to this brothers church and preach he used to come to my house or I was in his home once a week just about it we were great brothers and one day I preached right here in this church and he heard it through somebody else which I doubted he heard the whole message Bini how I preached it brother Branham had the revelation of this right here and I said let's see this is my revelation let's see if my revelation is the same as what he's saying what was any problem with that well he sent me word he didn't want me around him no more and I'll on her down he said because you say you got a revelation he said I've got a revelation that brother Branham was only one had a revelation well I'm sorry I thought a little bit carnal I said I had a revelation of what this was that brother Branham said and he said he had a revelation did it he didn't have a revelation that didn't go through my my brain too good that you got a revelation that you don't have a revelation that's that's all right it's no problem I love to brother no problem nothing all right but now listen see when God gives you the Holy Ghost now I'm gonna say this is appointed I haven't covered a lot but see when I came in the message I've talked to you and told you of my experience that I was two years in this message before I reclaim the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right because when I heard the Prophet talking about the Holy Ghost and what it was and the seal and the word and a different thing I knew we didn't have it but I couldn't tell everybody else they didn't have it because they wasn't gonna listen so I said I don't have it because none of my business what you have I'm just trying to help you it's your business between you and God what you have see I knew what he was saying about the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen at that time I had seen I had was a deacon for three or four years in a Baptist Church at 23 years of age I talked to adult Sunday School classes I don't have a bit of those thing and I didn't come into this message and say well I come into message that proved I had it because when I heard the Prophet talking about what the baptism of the Holy Ghost really was and it was the birth of the word now you tell me how that you can get the Holy Ghost until you heard the word Brees now I ain't sayin I ain't sayin so don't you say it I ain't sayin they didn't have no word back there enough to get a birth I believe that Baptist Church right over there he's got enough of the Word of God to be able to produce a birth because all it takes is the egg under the dog right will hatch the egg as well as a chicken sitting on the egg I believe that so don't don't misquote me I'm just sayin for myself I knew that we were twisted and perverted in the word we had some things right we were doing pretty good the Prophet Bragg's on it said you better leave them Baptists alone that they'll tie you up with the word well they were pretty good with it and there's already lookin gonna told my wife when I read the Bible their one-day tour that melikhaya 3 and Malachi 4 did it look like it's gonna be two prophets coming I'd already told that I still in the Baptist Church but you see the new birth is the birth of the word now how can you have it birth in you till you get the word when we heard the work you heard perverted now can I quote the Prophet he said false prophets produce false birth someone would have false word can't produce it real true Bertha why it's important who you listen take that any way you want it it's very vital who you hear because if it's a false prophet it'll produce a false birth I believe the message well hey two years I was in this message I have read six books in one day and listened to two types you know you won't tackle that you think I didn't have a good knowledge I had a good job brother Kali can tell you about it I said right down there with him they could know where I was at my boss was real good and he he knew where I was at he told me he said go hide he didn't want to get me tied up called he didn't know what was doing he had to keep me loose to where we could place could run no he didn't know what we're doing that's no joke see I'd be sitting down with brother Kali and reading half the night already coming to church brother Mo tried his best to get me to you know move on a little but with about two years I I've become a deacon up at Gainesville but it was after I received the baptism with the Holy Ghost think plug this to yours how about you what's your experience what do you base it on what do you based your new birth on today I believe the Prophet so does the devil now where we're going when I come into message the devil was our full year we gotta come on that's the point of what I'm getting at the word that we need to make sure to get that word correct all right so then the person is making the statement about what they're saying about what is what I believe I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost to the 120 in the upper room and as it came it births the word that they hailed and that word that they helped positionally position them in the body I was explaining all of that little run-through right we called it rabbit trail for Aaron okay that we get off on these reef preachers we get off on these rabbit trails I was explaining the whole thing I believe that you can be born again you could start off at knowledge now what is holding this minute now you got to get to new birth at faith it's got to be faith but you ain't listening see you could already progressed in enough faith that God could position you higher than anybody else that's why I praise you for studying the word that's why I say study the word read the Bible I've read the Bible when I never got a thing have you ever done that have you ever read the prophets method you ever listen to a tape now for a while when you finish the tape walk out and say what did I get now very riotous you're not going to get something by the Prophet but how many times if you took the Bible and read it and read it and read it and then one day you open up that same scripture to look at it and say who wrote that you know somebody put that in there cause he wasn't in that lifetime I read it like 10 times I read it it wasn't in there it was God quickening through this mind the brain that would open up time but open that up doesn't mean you're born again to open your understanding of the scripture doesn't mean you're born again it is part of the fact of believing and showing it it's not going to be open to you if you don't have the new birth but physically speaking you can get a lot of head knowledge and that's wonderful you know it's wonderful to get head knowledge see because only by getting head knowledge can you get all the ghost knowledge okay okay now this is the more of the statement see talking about the disciples and them receiving it as to were that they received it of the Holy Spirit they could have the pyramid except the headstone or the capstone okay because the headstone has not come yet all right I explained that a minute ago the headstone wasn't even there back in in that time the headstone can only come in the last days and it's your prophet city I didn't I didn't say yeah and he and the person says they had the Old Testament and the teachings and deeds of Jesus Christ including than listen including the seven seals of Matthew 24 the disciples had that they learned they had the teachings of the Old Testament they had the deeds of the Lord Jesus they had to seal sometimes they had everything in order you know to were that it could be birthed this is what the Holy Ghost would come to in order to Burke them as full-grown Christians you don't start Adam and Eve as I said a moment ago Adam and Eve wouldn't born babies and grown up you don't start you got to start the kingdom that's full grown so the disciples had to spend three and a half years with the Lord Jesus to get everything in order till when the Holy Ghost fell it would be able to do as he said the Holy Ghost through a brain to you remembers whatsoever I've taught and said in other words brother Branham paraphrasing it he takes it on he said it even teach you things to come see they had a wonderful position they were standing with and when the Holy Ghost came it could quicken that and make them what we would call for grown Christians which would be right here Holy Spirit down leave the headstone to come in the last days all right he said well Jesus what sure hey man Jesus was the headstone but he wouldn't make any manifest all right now so I agree with that part that they had been tutored and trained all right and then here's the point so you'll have to jump with it to listen to the thought decades later which means time later you know after a while when the New Testament church had the writings of Paul Peter James and John they had more effect or whatever could be said what effect did this have on the inner man in other words possessing him they had as I said you jump you got to an upper room you got to you got the people you got the Holy Ghost coming they had to fooled fooled brother Ron said they had these virtues all right had these virtues okay and they were birth dire then they were teaching Peter was teaching people how to being born again was the statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance he was teaching them how to do that and they already had a the background from the Lord Jesus and then they started with the writings of Paul Peter in them and see then you can clarify really and bring it through the ages if you brain correctly wait brought it here while back you should have listened to that the full word of God ly stood to the fourth church age now that's the words of the Prophet see when you get up to Martin in Calamba you know brother Bradley said there was no greater man than understanding outside the Lord Jesus except other words he put Martin right there as the greatest of all understand Columba was a great man see they taught the virtues in these things they told her requirements they told Christianity added a disciple to within it distorted naturally and it already some faded away and then it just started fading away once you've done away with those messengers who really held to the line who was it Martin was it Martin that the devil come to and is that the right one Martin one of them that the devil come to him you know and he stood I looked at him he said get out of here he said yeah you got a crown on and said according to the according to the word said will crown you said thanks you get out of here most of us who maybe never donated you know a little scared he wasn't scared he told to get out of here right all right see with the decades then later in other words time see then you could make the pure under and versus this statement from brother branham that the pure unadulterated word went into the ground at Nicaea alright you can bring it over to the fourth church age and see that that's where it started going into the ground you come out in Luther Wesley them you come out with the understanding see by the time you come out with Luther you had done officer revelation of the Godhead you had about a thousand years between or something in between Columbia and Luther and you fifteen hundred years and you had lost a lot of the understanding of the word and and started out having to rewrite and do you know Laura because see I'll state this one it says the Upper Room saints had and assist those outside the upper room in growing Phi stir up the stature of a perfect man I agree with that because that's what I'm trying to do no I mean you tell me you're born again I'm going to say you're born again well I mean you tell me I've had a new birth Roselle I'm gonna say you've had a new birth but I'm gonna say no alright now let's grow up in here you know let's grow up and he that's all I've been teaching for 50 years is growing up in him it's a daily growth it's a daily understanding and I admit a lot of times you do just did a minute ago sometimes you can read the message and you don't get it you were to see some of my books you were to see Daniel 70 weeks where I had questions I don't understand this I don't understand this I had questions it's all over every page you know I would not dare preach on that to level when those questions was marked up and put her okay because if I had a question I've done it would endure to try to con teach anybody else because you know what I teach them I'd teach them and leaving hang in with the question because that's where I was hanging in right so I had questions all right but not listening see it's always helped me to know that the Old Testament is the New Testament what is it conceited or what is it good dry and concealed okay all right and the New Testament is the Old Testament revealed I believe that the New Testament is the Old Testament revealed with the baptism the differ between the Old Testament and you is the baptism with the Holy Ghost you said know Jesus when you had to how Jesus get the baptism the holy God so the Old Testament in the New Testament comes out to be the wings of the eagle all right now I like this statement so it's not a question it's a statement of point do you think it would make a good steady to find where all of the seven virtues are mentioned in the Old and New Testament and look at the context of each time it is mentioned I agree with that 100% I just wish I had time if I ever get slowing down enough I'll try to do that I've thought of that on the series of doing and trying you know and mention a little bit as a matter of fact we'll take Wednesday night a little bit on something right around said and you'll see that I was taking this scripture over here and backwards and forth because I believe it's mention no I like this one too would it not be better to include the seven Church ages the seventy weeks Christ the mystery when you're talking about the capstone message since those truths are so interrelated I agree now let me put it in the way to so you can understand certain things all right and not other things so the greatest one out of the mall is the statue of a perfect man when the headstone unites with the body you're going to understand the statute of a perfect man more than you ever thought about because that's the one message I love that's the one I love it cuz you know what the Prophet said he said if you have any question don't steal some time or did he say go he said come out cross the mystery oh that's a wonderful message so I believe when the head unites with the body church that it's going to illuminate or not in other words it's going to really show us what these things are talking about all of them you know I believe predestination will be a greater understanding of went after the uniting of the head for the body one God will be of a great understand all the Bible will become unfolded because to me that's what I'm talking about in a simple little term see you take that head if you draw this pyramid correct you take this head you can put on these corners you don't try to do it here now because you're a little bit off ways and when you're drawing just to her but if you really put it there see because he's the head of the corner he's the head of the corner but then he's the headstone of the corner right see when we get to this message unfolding it's going to be a wonderful thing to me how it's unfolded for all of these 50 years it's been wonderful I have thoroughly enjoyed it what I'm looking forward every day to more of understanding of the word of God anybody got a question for we go we got about 10 minutes you thought all right come on museums will end it up I hope you'll just listens comes to me my emphasis is upon one time where would you and I be if God hadn't sent a prophet where would we be if God hadn't sent a problem I'm being physically you know that I put my whole life on - you know the fact that God sent a prophet I have no other things I have no other thoughts there's not a thought considered in my mind that is another prophet gonna come straighten out this prophet that's not scriptural he was either the prophet or not the Prophet and if he's not the prophet didn't who are you trying to be that's what I've always said to people if I can straight and brother branham how you're supposed to be following me not brother branham is that sensible that would be playing because if I could straighten him out I got to be greater than he is don't see this that's where the people wouldn't stand up with brother Branham and he'd say if you don't believe what I'm teaching you bring your Bible come over here and stand women what they wouldn't do it they were smart he said I give more respect he knew there wasn't gonna come up there he but what about it we've had the most wonderful message that could ever be thought of cause it curves us all the way from the new birth to the change of the body in the future home the things what else should we need to see we need our own ideas to just die and let Christ me understand what we got with you anybody have a need the older folk [Music] remember way to be minister in this afternoon is pray far oh my the printer [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh okay our little buddies saying he's having problems with
