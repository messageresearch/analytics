========================================

without what decision remember the people in Trinidad what are we missing what am I missing late okay alright remember the people in there some people have them I want it now once one Louise from my house I woke up he was alright let's get started now we're talking on the book Romans we're on Romans nine we've got it finally I finished the Romans eight last then me well time for last then starting on home is 9 Roman same is a beautiful chapter you know as well as I do it brings adoption in and grant and you birth it brings going on to perfection that brings in those who these justified is already glorified so what can we say to this Paul some eyes the whole chapter says if God be for us who can be against us so we must we must see that even in peril and life and death and all the things that go on that if God be for us who can be against us amen remember everything here is temporal temporary even your life that you're breathing right now is temporary right amen but we're not gonna breathe the same manner when we come back in the millennium know it would be a lot cleaner below their well-being disease going in and out of our body through our breath we'll have to ever worry about that again amen amen no what no that's your heart well that's all right but we got to we got we got to get there first that's right and this is our part now is to get in there part we got to get there first the man so we got to get the Bible down we got to get in all the scriptures down and I was thinking yesterday and actually this morning when I was writing my little note brother now about how that brother Graham said there was an eternal quality to the elect and that's what I was thinking brother Dale for doing was to bring he's bringing that eternal quality to us but he had to get clerks yeah there's always one had to get it first so he got the eternal quality first and he then he is he is giving that eternal quality to me and you and man eternal quality I love those two words eternal quality so in other words that quality is never going to go away that quality is always eternal and what is it is the Word of God it's the Word of God not even written form it's the Word of God reveal and that's what we're trying to see here there's the Word of God revealed not just the Word of God in a letter form because the lair kill will kill you all this will kill you if you don't become it and that's our whole that's our whole point even in the seals I believe brother Adam came to a point degree solve it then what he was bringing was the truth and that man had come to a place to we're all back in time is like I was saying Sunday they actually they put the Sun man out of the church they put Christ out of church because he was then you know at the door knocking there in Revelations and it was sealed and probably from me and Bob sent me a text I think maybe he understood what was going on but that that door was sealed with seven seals when they kicked him out of the church it was sealed with salmon sails and he couldn't get back in until he knocked on the door and thanks a prophet that opened the door first to let us in and then we could all go we can all bring Christ in there let him sup with us because I don't believe he's stuck with man since Adam the way he wants to he's not stuck with man the way he wants to except when Adam and Eve were in the garden there was no sin he said well he's he can stuck with the eleven well he stuck with Dwight I'm one of the devil but they didn't understand who he was until they came he came back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost into the believer so dark - Christ - so gloomy go but that way Mackey not know that wasn't that one creatures revelation yeah that's what we've done by Sunday okay well we're talking about a little bit more that's coming Sunday because what Peter said Jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you but my father in heaven that was the revelation of the father Peter never got that revelation he was speaking in a prophecy through it that God was speaking through Peter there aren't across the son living God because listen Peter never answered his question right Peter never answers the question but God being gracious God being patient Laurita this afternoon I'm going a little bit more Jesus asked said who do men say I the Son of Man am the son of man is something God's different he said Who I am I the Son of Man Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in other words you're the creator god but we don't in other words we don't understand why that flash is standing there yeah and you have to eat like we do go to the bathroom like we do you and you know the the problem was is the people is the same way with brother ground the people that were so close to brother Graham thought he was God in human flesh but still they couldn't understand them to be him because they had made him all kind of different things you know and he wasn't done there's no way it could be God he was born sex so he's no way it could be the first Lawrence on a god or even the second born country yeah amen so but he was one to come to introduce him he come to introduce was like oh the elephant preaching you you got we got to get this down right the Son of God was preached down through seven Church ages the Son of God which is God in you and the Holy Ghost right that's the son of God that's the creator come in and created me a new heart burning out the old nature and he comes in well now that's not the Son of man revelation that's the Son of God revelation is that God is going to save you because I want to read you this afternoon what we already do starting on I'm going to preach to them again it's alright you just have to be careful though you do have to be careful you don't want to give too much out then y'all could sleep during sex okay but remember the son of God in the form he was in never saving anybody yeah you heard what I say all through the Old Testament there was no one has salvation no no no no no no son of God goes all the way back to creator back to the beginning some of God's not Jesus Christ that's the heart becomes not getting yeah he is but at that dispensation he's not because the Son of man says I have power to forgive sins on the earth right the Son of God being forgive sins through the Old Testament he covered him he covered him remember there was animal sacrifices they only covered sin till the Son of God come into the form of the Son of Man the sea can save those who are lost TJ because the Son of God judgment was remember how brother Brennan said I always talk they don't hated me but Jesus loved me but I found out they were the same person well it was a different dispensation though under the Son of God dispensation of when he said let there be life you come through all the old testament he had saved one person born again you know number one understand what I'm saying born again where the soul of man was burnt out and God coming resided in the soul that can't happen under animal sacrifices right we're gonna read read Hebrews 9 and it grieves Hebrews 6 this is if that sacrifice had been worthy you could have just made one and you didn't have to make no more but every year that had to be a new sacrifice made why because it only covered and push to send to Calvary but my Christ come which is the son of God in human flesh in the beginning was the word words with God and the Word was made flesh you know it took four thousand years from verse one of hebrews hebrews 1 John 1 let's do John 1 John 1 said in the beginning was the word works with God heard one's own right in the beginning that's right here that's when everything was created verse 14 says and that word was made flesh there was four thousand years in between those scriptures but there was no salvation only salvation is in Jesus Christ hey I thought the Bible says the only salvation through Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ was who that's not a man that's it that's why he kept asking them who to use they out of the son of man them the only revelation they had was Peter in other words was saying we don't know exactly who you are but we know what's inside of you must have done something you're anointed you're the Messiah but now folks remember Peter said that great words those great words and Jesus even said Peter I'll give you the keys to the kingdom right whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth illusion heaven Peter denied him three times cursed him cursed right and when Jesus came back Peter didn't believe it cuz he went fishing he went right back to his regular normal duties so don't tell me that Peter had a revelation back in Matthew where he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he did not that was a foretelling of God speaking through a man named Peter why did he say that why did he say that we're gonna cover this afternoon film he said upon this rock upon that revelation of the Son of God I'll build my church so it was for the churches thank you love them now we know Peter name begun the church but not in that time there was no kingdom there was no church Christ had died here Christ had to die to release that son of God the Son of man went to heaven on the right hand of God the Son of man deflect man God is now in another dimension and then actually making intercession for us because he was flesh at one time the stripes and all that he said back to some of God sent back to spirit on the day of Pentecost I wasn't son of man what I kept saying last Sunday the son of man revelation was put out of the church and he's standing there knocking trying to get back in will praise God though that door was sealed with seven seals that door was sealed with seven seals in Revelations 3:14 and all that through them that was sealed with seven seals there was a seventh seal mystery that God was trying to get to the church and paint God in the end time during the property god the door was open and the Son of man stepped back into where he's supposed to be in the church which is now no other time not even when brother Branham was here did they have a revelation of the Son of Man only way of brendham had never left but but I say that we did I say that we do now how the revelation of it son of man who he is what's he doing where is he asked I told that the other day and I said now if Christ asks that question he's asking it every service now who do you say I the son of man take Peter out of the equation now because we can now answer that question Peter couldn't answer that question Peter was just Peter just got an unction from God to speak that because jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you but my father which is in heaven in other words he got an option from God spoke that just though that he could build his church on the Son of God revelation yes alright it's really but see if you stay out of the Sun God revelation than you you must pass away and and be called up in the resurrection only the son of man has the sign of the resurrection how many people did the son of man rage when he was here everyone he ever did person I was reading yesterday Jazz's daughter the widow woman that the kid was going they were having a funeral procession and he stopped that funeral procession he just reached me right that's what I'm telling you and will tell you something right now I'll tell you this afternoon - I'm gonna warn you about something watch Jesus's life because that's the son of man's life you watch brother round in the form I said in the form of the son of man not him being the son of man but using that revelation he didn't have to scream shout or holler at a demon or of disease or nothing he never raised his voice jesus never raised his voice that's right and actually actually you will make you go a little bit further Jesus would just walk into a room and the devil started talking to him when he goes to the air he walks out of the boat and the leading man walks up first thing Legion says Jesus did say now you but to devil no Legion said why are you here to torment us before our time they knew he and they said son of God which see they weren't looking at the human person they were seeing that anointing or that that spirit that they dealt with listen folks let me be real real let me give you a good revelation yeah I'm gonna preach this in right hand they had already seen him back in the breed with that they recognize who he was and they said why are you here because they knew they were judged back in another dimension somewhere baloney well guys if Michael was Christ even looking different Jesus did so that's how they recognized me why are you coming here before our time to torment us now son of God can we leave I like it when you walk in a room and they won't believe most of the time we bring in with us I'm sorry but most of the time but look that's the son of man revelation yeah that's what we gotta come to see you next one brother branch at hospitals we're not going to one of the walk in the hospital I don't thinking and everybody just instantly be healed but I don't see why we can't be having a that's a discussion like this and a man and God walks in and starts just speaking the Word of God just not not just preach it excuse me talking like we're talking we just a talking like we're talking and a demon just leave the building something that's been bothering you how many times have you been in church service though something being bothered something that's bothered you and when you left it left what was that right what was that was the Neyman that walked in with you that was attached to you that left now they he's got another buddies they come from you know they come back but but that's what I'm talking about when we talk about the son of man don't do Matthew Mark Luke and John brother they will told us many times that's what I'm doing that I'm going back to Matthew Mark Luke and John and getting the character of the Son of Man if you don't want to know what son of man is you you look Matthew Mark Luke and John that's what he was so jesus walks up to Jairus his daughter they Steve's away he's no she's not dead that last day remember because of their own belief he had to clear the rhythm yeah they said for Peter James and John and him and the mother and the father and he raised her up well then the little guy who's had a funeral procession with the widow woman he just said hello men and he just reasoning to war by the hand he didn't shade and scream and blessed not on this no he just laid his hand on him and the kid raised bed now that is the stuntman revelation they had listened the Son of God revelation we come through Pentecost some of you that did come to Pentecost and you saw the shaking in the shout him to slap him in the pushing and I don't let the devil leave but when the Son of man was on earth the devil identified him the angel identified him and he identify yourself who the men say i the son of man ma'am even brother branham said many times Jesus never called himself the Son of God he said you say you say why because that was there that's all they could see they can see that that man hanging on the cross was gone all night eating human flesh they couldn't take that but that was the son of man and the son of God was operating inside of me I hope you don't know I hope you understand that I'm not doing away with the Son of God but there's dispensations that he works in I've read you that quote I'm gonna read it again yes previous word brother Graham City come in three names son of man son of God son of David but in between now according to his own word the Son of Man will be revealed will reveal himself in a different way so he's gotta reveal itself in a different way than anybody's ever seen you know Michael then they didn't seem as a son man when the twelve were walking with it who the men I say the son of man I am bothered we know you're something you know we know you're they watched him create so the revelation was now I want the Christ the Son of the Living God well they know that that was the creator something inside that man created but they couldn't understand what how it was connected to flesh right so I'm telling you when the son of man revelation comes known among us it's not going to be it's not going to be signs and wonders so much is that maybe it follows you but I was reading this morning no that's not where brother Adam was saying that was just the bait on the hook he has to be the message behind it brother they'll think reason there's a message behind every move of God there's a message comin that's it all the other stuff is just it's the bait on the hook but we want the hook the hook is the message and I don't know why the world I've done spent 30 minutes we had needles burn on our on our lesson well we'll get some more up this afternoon we need to understand even in that fourth seal that if we're out of here then we've come to an understanding that we're gone yes okay so maybe we'll get a little bit into the shout the voicing in the Trump if we can get to that this afternoon and if I keep you awake woman all right I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accused from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants now watch this is what oh excuse me mercy the Old Testament Pete Paul is going who are Israelites who fancied and the glory and the covenants that was the Old Testament covenants and the giving of the law that's the Old Testament and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all so in other words Christ came to what fulfill the law bring the promises to pass there's only one covenant acts 2:38 that's the only covenant there is repent everyone I've even be baptizing them in Jesus Christ from the making and saying you shall receive the gift of the whole ago yeah right that's all the one I want you have all of other covenants if you want but that one I want to start with all right because if you don't get started right you won't end right whose are the fathers and illumise concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not us no the Word of God had taken none effect so they are not Israel all Israel which are of Israel now many times we do we fall into the same thing when we say well the bride looks man you know I did have so many things to manage looking bad for the varieties never look bad for the bride it's never looked bad for true Israel they were looking at behind the parts they were looking at the white the mixed multitude you say this in this message yelling I'll say right now there's more makes multitude than there are real breath in this message cuz they know about the letter they don't know about the word they're stuck in another dispensation they're stuck in another age not all as little visual so if you say well the bride sure looks bad the bride's never leave me look bad there man hey man they're right for an example for an example okay Jim's pretty in the morning if she isn't afternoon even though I know she's my bride so she's never looked back okay now now they sometimes type of crisis crisis never looked at us as bad never looked at us it's bad right these always look weirder bride Carrie we're the ones that attach all this stuff to it well I gotta do this and I gotta make sure this I got that laundry list I'll keep doing you need to get rid of yeah quit drinking smoking husband where you dress is long time stuff you hired don't smoke don't drink don't that's a laundry list that's bonded your rubber from the freighter brother hmm well then usually no I thought he's like you guys don't become 0.4 they are not all Israel what you're Israel so get what I'm saying get your eyes focused on the truth if you'll focus your eyes on the truth you'll always see the good the bride in good shape okay okay because she'll always be the word now now hold on a minute according to the dream that brother Brown had the bride look beautiful but right at the back some of them started getting out of step some started getting out of step and what did he say get back in staff right well that was the priest in the end time get back in step that's us I wasn't him give my because remember the women were in the back part of the procession he said some in the back we're getting out of step well it didn't make her not bride it just made just match you with having a little fault here a little faults there you can get back in together all right okay so not only everyone intro because remember when Burrell Ramsey he saw the first church which looked good then he saw the American bride which was horrible then he saw the second preview which is nice but some kind of got out of step right toward the end and that's our problem we get sometimes we get out of step a little bit what a step step is rhythm the Word of God has a rhythm to it when you read it it should have a rhythm to it he should not be scattered that's this is not a shotgun gospel yes the Gospels got away I am the way the truth people are many men either because they are the seed of Abraham are that all children because they're standing there talking to Jesus before this and they said we be of Abraham's lineage in other words he said if you didn't own Abraham you know me right well he one connected Abraham in C natural C didn't have no natural state but what the faith seed of Abraham comes all the way down to me and you that's right so neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children right there's a listen to be honest there's a lot of natural seed of Abraham that's not that this don't be inhale a natural seed but there won't be one spiritual seed of Abraham not one they'll all be bright or they're all been going other I'll be given eternal life but in Isaac shall thy seed be called remember the Bible says not seeds as of many because there was only one seed of Abraham that was Christ but see once we enter into Christ that brings us walk into a multiple form of just one person Christ Jesus amen that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the sea what was the promise the faith seed of Abraham that you would have a child now I want you to remember this for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son now remember Abraham when he first started his journey god never told him he'd be through Sarah he just said you're gonna have a son and abraham tried and goofed up Hagar had Ishmael right at the beating of Sarah you're right she pushed him in to do it and that's where you got to be careful you have to be careful with that you know listening to that that reasoning right but at that time Sarah didn't have revelation either see Sarah was just like Eve she's trying to help Dodd promote the program he was trying to have God promote the program so Sarah had that same spirit devil that was time to promote the program the labor camp Robert Oh Sarah says hey Doc told me I was gonna have a promised child and stares like well you know you might be okay but me and you've been having relations since we were teenagers and when he produced nothing yet so Sarah goes hey doc let's try this and it didn't work out but we got it when Melchizedek coming told him sitting by Sarah you're gonna have according to the time a lot see they're nice that's why brother Brown saying that we'll cover that maybe later on for brother grounds that they were seated faith has to go just like Abraham would you have to meet mill cares that you have to meet dot in human flesh I love the thought that for a second but no brother Randall told us I believe it was in who this mill Kennedy that every stunt of the faith will meet the same journey as they for him make the same journey as Abraham met call he went through justification in time just forgetting st. sketch about his logos and then at the end he met God in human flesh now you meet Jesus same person labels a different flex that flex couldn't die for you he couldn't be our brother but that was gone in human flesh that's right all-male cast it becomes a male cast it became Jesus Christ man [Music] absolutely why would I look different Melchizedek is not some old well Cassidy went some old gray-headed looking some that's a reasonable question that sure true dance but if the Anthony of God never changed that's why I say God even Jesus when he that's why nobody knew him when he resurrected it was twenty years old when he resurrected you 130 don't look 50 [Laughter] sorry so anyway when you got it just make sense folks because he meant of two of the masks in another form the Bible says now he wasn't in another form remember no one saw Jesus below twenty years old except Joseph and Mary Joseph in Mary I mean Joseph was dead at that time because he was an older man he's already gone Mary's the only one that knew who he was but she didn't see him till later remember he appeared to Mary Magdalene and she thought it was a gardener a young boy working in a rose bushes mm-hmm because she had seen him in 30-something years oh right but when Jesus came out of that tomb he wasn't no thirties he often was head of Christ that's right he look like the God who created everything that's what I'm told about Jim when she was when she went to that Baptist Church for a while that is booklet about that day and it was experiencing God and the person they had in front of that piece of paper I would want an evil laugh with Tuzla no he didn't he look like kind of but he also looked like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute he look like what was the guy that slept for all that time here's experiencing God and this is the way that I look we've got come on the ball hit up the head and they're down spring oh wow looking like this sure it is sure news that's got mistakes on for Revelation now the wrong turns in that was that was a bad mister but not something against the Baptist they just don't have a revelation like we just a grade right when God said let there be light he would he look twenty years old I say because brother Ron said he was in the problem if we're gonna try to be changed back to the problem my life God said God's never not been a problem his life yes right right man so that's the dog we're gonna say that's the Guardian Abraham I mean that's the time that Abraham man in human flesh smell Cassady it wasn't milk it is a day like this man come on pay now in 28 days that's a man I won't be like right there 20 year old you know prime alive yeah that's Mel Cassady that's the God we serve amen they don't serve a god because they do like you said true if you got a father he's gotta look over the signs gotta look younger yeah and I don't think to have much of a clue what Holy Ghost in I mean you never see a picture that deep never listen I did see one picture of Melchizedek yeah somebody had a picture on the wall of Abraham Washington up heads of these feet and he was just a young young boy a 20 year old young boy now whoever got that got a revelation cuz listen be honest with everybody in this room until today or even before you got a good revelation you all thought Melchizedek was an older man yeah raise your hand never ever yes you did you thought he was an older man now he's a young kid and when listen when Joshua met the captain of the hoax he went all man right go that's why I Joshua when he pulled that sword he said are you for us or against us Wow cuz he was a formidable opponent he said nothing huh that was exactly the cross was he had just took on the form he took up a body just like he did milk after then and he was standing there saying nothing I'm the captain of the hope I'm sure Joshua then what did he do y'all keep reading that he took his shoes off because that captain said take your shoes off you're a holy ground now happen that goes back to Moses at the burning bush and listen if Moses want to have a revelation if Moses would have rebel a current revelation when he looked in that bush he was seen young Winston but he only saw it on fire because of the time of his revelation and you know what the time of my revelation could have been that dog was this older gentleman but not now no very youthful magically created everything that that was in the world and stars and knowledge staff laughs why would you want an old man do that you want somebody I think you had fun I'm just gonna we won't get nowhere there I just think God had fun I think he had fun he said I'm gonna put this galaxy over here let's move it over let's put 14 planets over here and let's have nine over here we're gonna put the Sun mirror move everything over and start here go over here to me that's to me that's God standing there just having fun and firing well when you brother Brown say his example was a child playing before the father doorstep that was the son creating all things let me say created a body his buddy sure God I listened God never had didn't have a body God always had a body even when I read it yesterday and I want to try to maybe not cover this this Sunday but you know Jesus told the woman at the well or Nicodemus a daughter's a spirit no man has seen God at any time well now that doesn't mean that he's just this cloud that you said no he's a person he's always had fingers arms hands feet eyes ears nose mouth whatever you want to say even internal organs because remember we're human beings and we were made just like see that's all right [Music] God is alive it's nothing exactly what he is but remember he's not a life force like when you see these movies where it like daddy always said you know you see this pulsating light you know where you see this entity floating through no he's a person he's he's is solid more solid than we are I was thinking about yesterday was just a Gabby's mother died last night famiglia didn't know that but they sent us to the tanks to be praying for him and I don't know we see I've salted something laying there in the casket and she went somewhere she's more solid better than she is Nick right because she's an eternal person right okay if she's born again she's an eternal person she's more alive now that's our problem we tell us she's you know that she's going on well that's fine that's okay we can we can be sorrowful but man we got to realize that that's more real than this because this is going to pass away that won't that's what a point like that is that's the second dimension that's not going to pass away that's actually going to come here into this dimension we're all going to be changed and then we're gonna go in a rapture but when we get let's just read a few ladies I'm sorry Billy Joe hey get your hand up but you were here at 9:30 comiendo not a god was an old man is creating everything will it take from an overdose one in the ring yeah that's the God we serve I mean we don't serve an old God we start laying the new vibrant alive somebody that when we get to heaven with him he's not gonna have to win him we're not gonna he's not gonna have to take time off to recuperate neither are we correct if you've heard Aaron preach - spend years ago all God done is stepped into this dimension took some dirt and went what did the dirt do the dirt just warmed around what I already will stand in line so Mel Cassidy look like died he was gone but the form look like done the the guy that was the the guy that was the captain of the hosts looked just the same and if you want me to prove that I'll let brother round improve it for you just before we go brother Brown brings the analogy of the Dead Saints now that Jesus when he died he went down to hell preach to the souls in prison remember he comes back up knocks on the door paradise who opens the door abraham opens his own now who was that stand at the door that was Jesus tried in history - II at 20 years old right Abraham said look Sarah there's the man we faded after the confucius Christ that's right bi Abrahamson we had a castle you deadly he said yeah come on we got nothing else to be but now remember that same form in the form of the holy ghost has got to go into you now you don't take on that form we're not going to ever all look like Jesus Christ when we got female around right physically but to formally take is the form he saw and in Genesis 1:26 he main command and you'll never change from that that's what you'll be for an eternity there by okay well then you go upstairs now cuz we don't have anything done here old man [Applause] darling [Music]
