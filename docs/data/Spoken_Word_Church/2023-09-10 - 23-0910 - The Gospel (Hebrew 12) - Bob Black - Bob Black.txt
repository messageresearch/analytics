TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you come expecting I believe we're going to hear something from from the Lord today I want to start out by reading on John 3 16 because we're studying the book of Hebrews and on Hebrews chapter 12. um I really I think the sense of what Paul is trying to communicate as we study these things out is it's not anything that we do ourselves to be saved as as we read that we're we're not come to the mountain of thundering smoking uh scary things but we've come to the Mount Zion we come to the promises we have come to the to see the Fulfillment of all the promises that God made in the Old Testament and all through scripture that we have come to these things and it's not by our own efforts but it's by looking to what Jesus Christ has already done and you know that's really this morning as we as we kind of Stow these things out that's really the essence of the Gospel we're just all of our hopes everything we are we're looking to what Jesus Christ did there on the cross John 3 16 says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so it's not how it works that saves us is what Christ did for us and if we'll just look to him that he'll see us through amen so let's before we really study these things out and uh get to Hebrews 4 12 14 15 16-17 let's just buy our heads and pray oh God we ask Lord that you'll just come Among Us this morning and bless this study as we study these words out Lord God I pray Lord that these things will be edifying to us to help us Lord to see things a little bit more clearly Lord than we just asked Lord that you'll be with brother Noel and he's as he's back there studying Lord help him Lord God as he prepares Lord God that our hearts will be prepared and just give him Liberty to speak your word to us this morning we ask you lord it's a blessing upon the congregation in your name amen and so verse 14 of Hebrews 12 where we've been reading through says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby meaning be defiled of course we kind of Miss studying out bitterness and what that is but look at the example Paul gives us he says lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright so he's using an example of Esau that made a bad decision so he's cautioning us this let's let's uh make wise decisions count account in your head account in your mind what is the what is the thing that is most valuable in life to think that Esau would would trade his Birthright what God had promised to him for a little bowl of lentil soup a a little morsel of meat and that's what Paul is explaining to us here in verse 17 he said he said for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected because now it the blessing in the Old Testament had been given to his brother so now now that's where his bitterness sprung from it's too late now you you done washed your your blessing be given away to your brother before he found no place of repentance though he saw that carefully with tears and then Paul goes on to say in verse 18 He said for ye are not come under the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the words should not be spoken to them anymore where they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dark and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake now think about that what Paul's expressing to us now he's saying you're not come to that you're not coming to that scene where and now let's go back in the Old Testament and really examine the scene that he's really telling to the Hebrews you know he was speaking to a group that that letter that he wrote was a a group of people that were familiar with the Old Testament scriptures but you know sometimes you know the Gentiles are were maybe not so much familiar with the things that he was referring to but he was referring to in Exodus chapter 19. I'll just read a few scriptures so you can kind of compare the two in verse 16 he said and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud this this is the chapter where God is making a covenant promise to Israel and he told Moses to gather everybody together on the third day that God is going to speak to them and he's going to make all these promises to him and he and he told them I'm going to make we'll read the promises of the Covenant that he made in a moment I'm going to make you a holy nation I'm gonna I'm gonna make you a kingdom of priests everybody's going to be a priest everybody in the world will be able to see the witness now you think about the day we're living in right now the comparison that that the what God wanted wanted to use them for and and um and as we read this kind of think let's let's make it a present tense story that God wanted to make all these promises to them but he wasn't God's intention was not that they would have to do something but they were just here he's word and that God would affect his purpose in their lives and they got it wrong they got the interpretation of what God wanted wrong and that's how maybe sometimes we come to church and we hear the gospel preached and we begin to think that I've got to do something but it comes down to you just look to the Cross look to what Jesus did and have faith in him it's not that you are doing anything you know your your whole journey starts with you you can't even you can't even make a move to God because he said no man can come to the father except the father draw him so it's all God doing it you hear the gospel preached and something begins to stir in your heart and he begins to pull at you and you surrender your life and you go down into the water but it's all him doing it and drawing you and pulling you to himself it's not oh thank God that we've got a gospel where we don't have nothing to do in it it's not how much you pray or how much you fast or how much you work or how much how much psychology you can read or how much all of these different things you can do it's all God doing it to think that as you hear them as you hear the word being preached today if you just let that word have an effect in your life it will accomplish the purpose that it was sent for it won't return to God void that it will have an effect in you you're in so this Covenant promise that God is making in verse in in Hebrews in Exodus chapter 19 verse 16 and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mount and Mount Sinai was all together on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in Fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by voice now let's just go back real quick and just read again what Paul was saying here he's saying you are not come under the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire and or into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of trumpet and the voice of words and all those those things let's let's read what brother Brown said in Jehovah Jireh he said now that Covenant lasted Israel on up until they made their final mistake Exodus 19 hundreds of years later when God had looked what Grace had provided the unconditional covenant not on any grounds at all but just on Grace it was provided now see how man's mind can twist the promise of Grace into this is what happened there in Exodus 19 to where they began to think that God wanted them to do something to be pleasing to God and isn't that what Paul has already explained to us in Hebrews 11 that faith is how you please God the way that you please God is just by believing him it's not that you work up something or try to do anything but just believe God and then believe in God will produce works in your life but we don't put Works before Faith Works comes after Faith works as a product of faith when they were taking their Journey to the promised land as God had promised back here Abraham his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years under bondage but would come out look they was already out from under the bondage God by Grace had provided them a prophet a pillar of fire a sacrificial lamb a greatest Revival that ever had and that was standing on the bank's dancing beating tambourines and having a real Pentecostal Jubilee everything their enemies all killed behind him and everything and yet they wanted something to argue about they wanted to get a law so they could have something to do into it now there's there's The Human Condition that we want something to do and we want some we want our part when our kids are going astray we want to go in metal with it and and do something but so many times the right answer is just let turn loose and let God have his way let God let God move on the scene God will bring it his word to pass Amen in Exodus 19 where if we look what the Covenant is look what God promised them at the beginning of that chapter and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying Thou shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed now these I've got these four parts highlighted and keep my Covenant then you should be shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people and I think we could apply that to the present day that that's what God wants he wants you to be a peculiar treasure to him for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and of course what we do we know is we can type that today a priest makes sacrifices and that's why you made a sacrifice this morning you came to church and you made a sacrifice to get up out of bed and maybe maybe this morning you weren't feeling good but you'd sacrificed ministers sacrifice all the time they sacrificed their time maybe when they're not feeling like studying but they sacrifice because that's what a priest does that's what you're called to do is make sacrifices for God you sacrifice your life you sacrifice everything you are for him for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and that's what God is promising them that he can just by hearing the word and believing what he he promised he would he would make them a holy people these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel you think what the Covenant is obedience to God's voice just listen to it and do what he says special relationship a kingdom of priests and a distinct identity and the people said in verse 8 and all the people answer together and said all that the Lord hath spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord now brother Brandon would highlight this is the the great mistake that they made and that's the great mistake that people make today down through the seven Church ages as they hear the gospel they hear the message preached and they see people living a changed life that God has gotten a hold of their life and changed them they begin to think maybe not quite understanding that I've got I'm going to like like all those examples that brother round gave us I'm going to put feathers in poke the the the feathers in my back so I'm you know look try to fake it and and all those things try to work something up and spiritual adoption brother Adam said Moses represented the law God gave the children of Israel the law because that they wanted the law God didn't want them to have it that's man's choice in Exodus 19 they said you give us something to do to Merit our Salvation we'll keep a law if you'll give it to us in other words but it never was God's plan it's better just to quit planning yourself and just use his plans I find that much easier to take his plan right and uh he swore by himself he said when they come out with him God out in the wilderness said oh oh give us something to do we want to form us an organization and we want you to give us something to do let us make us something like this give us a law to keep Exodus 19 was the greatest mistake that Israel ever made when Grace had already provided their salvation and they wanted something to do to Merit it God already swore to Abraham what he was going to do what he was going to get to go now see why I read John 3 16 at the beginning there's nothing you can do to Merit salvation it's all on Christ what he did on the cross that's what we're preaching is Christ amen they said let us have the law and the law never did no one never kept it they never did because you're not saved by works you try to be saved by works and try to keep all the letter of the law and sooner or later you'll mess up somewhere oh but God when God puts that law in your heart it changes your desire that changes everything the law what does the law do the law is is like exposes our guilt our need for something and now see this is now I'm I'm talking about the gospel message this morning we're going to kind of back up and just make it real simple to declare what what really is the gospel the law declare it exposes your guilt let's examine like what the Ten Commandments are really saying that thou shalt have no other gods before me and then we put all these things in our life maybe if you if you if we put all these things before God and put maybe our family or uh you know even sometimes things that look good before God and then you're you're guilty before God you see if we go down this list of all these things it exposes the need for a savior Thou shalt not make unto thee even engraven image Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain you know you wouldn't even you wouldn't use your mama's name and uh just as like a byword or something but people will use the name of Jesus as just kind of something to just toss around when they wouldn't even you do that with their mama and you see when you do that it's exposing your guilt that you need a savior that's what the law the law is like a judge pointing his finger at you saying you're guilty you need something remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy honor thy father and thy mother or their respect you know if you you think about all the times brother Brown talked about how he would talk back to his mama and and daddy until his mouth was just mushed and he had to drink through a straw that's my testimony I I had such a bad temper when I was young I was constantly in trouble for uh back talking and things and you we're all guilty of things like that and you see the word is preached and it begins to expose your guilt that there's something wrong that you need a savior Thou shalt not kill and Jesus magnified the law and said if you speak against your brother behind his back if you gossip then you've you're guilty of murder Thou shalt not commit adultery but you just look at a woman with lust in your heart and you've committed adultery with her already in your heart so there the law is exposing our need for a savior that it's not by works within ourselves that we can do how can we satisfy the law when the law makes us guilty Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor and thou shalt not covet oh we really if we really dive into all these things what kind of guilt would it expose we need a savior but Grace law puts us in jail but Grace the grace of God sets us free that's what John 8 3 6 3 8 36 says that if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed free from free from all all the bondage that the devil has put you under Galatians 5 1 says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage now you think about I was thinking about this the other day it's a a young person asked me what's what's your favorite Doctrine and you might say well my favorite Doctrine you might go to a doctrine that maybe could make you look real big in the head and make you something to give you brag brag and rice to show the great Revelation that you have but you know I began to think my favorite Doctrine is it is free there's nothing you got to do for salvation it's a free gift from God that is my favorite doctrine that there's nothing when you come to church this morning there ain't nothing you got to do to get it all you got to do is look to him look to Jesus Christ and Roman all these things this slide I'm here I've got here displayed it Grace Grace is a free gift from God that you didn't have to do nothing to get anything Romans 6 22 says but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life and taking signs with Jesus brother Brown said not by works not by Deeds not about power not by might by my spirit saith God not what I done what I am or what I will be but what he is and I am in him and whatever he is I'm part of him amen I'm saved because I'm part of him and he is God and I'm part of him being his son that's right so ain't what I done but what I will do is what he has done that's my trust right there now that means that means that you know you go into the bookstore and you'll find all these self-help books and things that you can read and we try to work up something and you know even in Matthew 6 27 says I I love this scripture but Jesus said which of You by taking thought and I'm going to apply it to like you go into the bookstore and you pull all these self-help books off the off the shelf and it says you've got a problem maybe maybe with pride or maybe you got a problem with whatever and you try you you want to think real hard I I want to I want to get rid of that but it's not by thinking real hard you can take you can take thought as much as you want but it won't add one cubit under your stature that's why I I want to this morning devalue poking at one another and identifying one another's faults but that because that's not how it works and you're not going to get rid of Pride or enmity or anything like that by going up to somebody and say look at all this enmity you got but I tell you what to get rid of it is when you let the word of God have an effect in your life and you become subject to the word and let it blame you it's not by self-improvement it's not by mindfulness or goal setting or behavior modification or going to Alcoholics Anonymous or communities and sitting around and sharing your ideas and your opinions but it's the word of God claiming your life and having an effect in you it's not by works and we could go through all these things observing rituals and moral Purity and fasting and all that all the things maybe that even the Catholic Church will do regular confessions and almsgiving and pilgrimages and so forth and so on it all just becomes legalism and legalism you know if you really examine it it's the belief that salvation or favor with God can be earned through strict adherence to religious rules rituals and moral codes believing that one's own efforts and good works can secure your salvation now let's not lose sight of where we are we we're reading Exodus 19 and studying these things out and studying out what Paul meant it was as he was saying we're not at that mountain where they were we have come to the Fulfillment all the promises of scripture we have come to Mount Zion and a great company of angels and the thick cloud of witnesses and all those things legalism look what legalism does if you come like they did it there in Exodus 19 it can lead to a self-righteous attitude because you believe that your saved by works by the things that you're doing and a judgmental Outlet towards others who did not adhere to the same set of rules it can also create a sense of pride in one's own achievements and a constant fear of falling short or not measuring up to the required standard brother Randall said in God's covenant with Abraham and his seed he said in the Dove was not cleave apart when when God put when Abraham made his sacrifice and God put him to sleep there and showed him the burning lamp moving between the sacrifices and so forth the dove wasn't clever part but the animal showing the difference between them that there would be a time that law would change to Grace and so forth Grace was first and Grace had already provided a savior down in Egypt they already had a Moses to deliver them out they already had a sacrifice they already had everything but where Israel made her final fatal move is in Exodus 9 Exodus 19 where she taken on and wanted law and rejected Grace that's right Grace is always right not what you do it's what you believe it isn't works lest any man should boast is by grace are you saved through faith faith and what's what's Grace here's a picture of a man leaving prison he's been set free he's got his paperwork there he's he's on his way home it's unmerited favor freely given by God without any requirement for humans to earn it there's nothing for you to do to earn it and cut the message conference brother said the children of Israel on the road back they had another conference with God Moses did at the Red Sea we'll call that the Red Sea conference one right in the line of duty lay trouble and listen Christians there's where you'll make your fatal mistake there's what Israel made her fatal mistake when she asked for a law to serve God by in Exodus 19 after Grace had done provided his savior Moses a prophet done provided a lamb done provided a covenant done provided all these things and yet they wanted something to do themselves they wanted some theology that's what's the matter today if we'd have left Pentecost the way it was at the beginning but we had to have something to argue about we had to be Oneness Tunis threeness Church of God all these riding humpback camels of one hump two humps three humps and so forth what difference does it make how many humps a camel's got as long as we're riding in what difference does it make whether you're in a Ford or a Chevrolet just keep moving now let's meditate on that statement just a moment doesn't matter where you are just keep moving it doesn't matter if you're in a good spot or a bad spot just keep moving just keep moving on now isn't that exactly what Paul's been explaining with all these Parables and examples of running a race you're in a race so don't stop just keep moving it doesn't matter whether you're in a Ford or Chevrolet whether somebody you see it doesn't matter whether somebody maybe believes a little bit different than you do where all God's got us all in control and he's all drawing us into Oneness with him so just keep moving I I think that's what Paul is trying to express here it's like you're in a race and it doesn't matter if you're at like this man here in this picture in bad shape it doesn't matter maybe if you just fall in the ditch you just get get back up and you you just just keep moving no matter where you are in life get back up and keep going what difference does it make brother Brown said whether you're in a Ford or a Chevrolet just keep moving amen for a year not come under the mount that might be touched and that burn with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest but ye are come unto Mount Zion now somebody told me it says when you're reading these scriptures and things it sounds like you're making this a present tense thing and and I want to say I'm not Paul is Paul is the one that said we're we're preaching a present tense gospel that he's the same yesterday today and forever you listen sometimes to the way that people talk and it seems I think we've been putting things way off in the future for so long it's time to believe and it it's the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is always a present tense reality even if there are more aspects and things to be unfolded in the future but yet he's here right now he's here and I missed doing wonders and he's working a miracle in your life as he's changing you and that's what I believe Paul is saying when he says you you are come unto the Fulfillment whatever every prom every promise every type in the Old Testament was speaking of where you are right now you are coming to Mount Zion and think about what these things are Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God speaking of speaking of that place where we're going to live but it's also speaking of the Bride is speaking of this this diagram behind me on the board here you're come to these things the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels what's he talking about a numeral numerable company of angels and Hebrews chapter 1 verse 14 he said that Angels were ministering Spirits ministering ministering to The Heirs of Salvation so you come to a place where those angels are attentive to you that's what to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven unto God the judge of all and to spirits of just men made perfect you've come to you've come to where the Holy Ghost can make your life make make your soul perfect and begin to mold you into into the likeness of Jesus Christ into Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel you have come to these things in other words the the Old Testament and we'll stop on this the Old Testament had all the The Ten Commandments that we can read about look look at those stones there but now in present tense God has given us the ability that somebody is going to see this word live today amen and we'll stop on that God bless you foreign [Applause]
