[12:58] That's falling out there. Amen. and he
[12:59] can shelter us from that.
[13:00] Amen.
[13:01] So, we just appreciate the Lord.
[13:02] Appreciate each and every one of you
[13:04] coming out and uh thank you all for your
[13:06] prayers this even uh this past weekend.
[13:08] We were in Orlando ministering there.
[13:10] They had some special meetings. Um
[13:13] they're trying to what brother Stacy
[13:15] Goodbred who's a pastor there is trying
[13:17] to uh uh work with some of the Latin
[13:19] groups there and they were trying to put
[13:22] the meetings there so that uh it's going
[13:24] to be a yearly thing and just kind of
[13:27] just bring all the the the Latin
[13:29] churches in the area. some people from
[13:30] Texas came over
[13:33] and we had uh I'd say what I don't know
[13:36] maybe about 200 maybe about 200 there
[13:40] from different parts of Florida and and
[13:42] Texas they some came flying in
[13:44] and it's uh throughout the years uh
[13:47] there's been just a lot of hurt and a
[13:49] lot of things that have taken place in
[13:50] some of the Latin churches there in
[13:52] Florida
[13:53] people leaving the message splits all
[13:55] kinds of things and so brother Stacy
[13:57] Goodred really felt he they've they've
[14:00] thought about doing this for the longest
[14:02] time and finally they executed this
[14:04] year.
[14:05] So, Brother George Smith was there uh as
[14:08] well. Brother Favian Palma from Chile
[14:10] who's preached here before was there um
[14:13] and some some other brothers were there
[14:15] and uh we were able to minister to them
[14:17] on Saturday morning and of course I
[14:19] interpreted the rest of the time. Amen.
[14:21] got to interpret for brother George
[14:22] Smith for the first time which was so I
[14:25] was interpreting for the interpreter
[14:26] because
[14:28] yeah brother George Smith is a good
[14:30] interpreter. So so that that that was a
[14:32] highlight of mine. So
[14:34] we just appreciate your prayers and
[14:35] thank you all for um thinking about us.
[14:38] Just continue to remember brother Dale
[14:39] and and your prayers
[14:41] and the Lord would continue strengthen
[14:42] his body. Amen.
[14:44] Amen. Let's just go ahead and turn to
[14:46] the word this evening and uh let's turn
[14:49] to Revelations chapter 1. I'm not
[14:52] planning on keeping you all too long
[14:53] this evening. We're just going to I
[14:56] guess maybe do a little Sunday school
[14:57] lesson. Um talk about our position in
[15:00] Christ. Amen.
[15:01] Amen.
[15:02] And uh I'm going to title this the
[15:04] revelation of Jesus Christ reveals you
[15:06] in the body.
[15:07] Amen.
[15:07] Amen.
[15:08] Amen.
[15:09] And uh it's interesting because when you
[15:11] read this the these scriptures, Amen.
[15:14] Think about think about who is Jesus
[15:17] Christ in this hour.
[15:19] Amen. That's right, brother.
[15:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's Christ in
[15:22] you.
[15:23] This is what the word says.
[15:24] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[15:27] That's right, brother.
[15:27] Amen. So Christ can't manifest himself
[15:30] if he doesn't have arms, your arms to
[15:32] use. Your hands to use, your feet to
[15:34] use. Praise the Lord. And sometimes we
[15:37] undermine our position in Christ.
[15:40] That's right. Sometimes we look down on
[15:42] ourselves and think we can't. I can't.
[15:45] Amen. But he wants us to be because we
[15:47] are heirs and co-airs. Amen.
[15:50] We are joint hes with him.
[15:51] So whatever he has, I have.
[15:53] Whatever he obtained, I obtained.
[15:55] Everything is his is mine.
[15:57] Praise the Lord.
[15:58] So I believe that with all my heart. So
[16:00] let's read Revelation chapter 1. The
[16:02] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[16:05] gave unto him. Think about this. the
[16:08] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[16:09] gave unto you as well.
[16:12] Amen.
[16:13] To show unto his servants things which
[16:16] must come to pass. I mean, hasn't he
[16:18] done that in this day?
[16:20] Yes, sir.
[16:21] Praise the Lord. So, think about as it's
[16:22] not just for him. It's for us as well.
[16:24] When you're reading these scriptures,
[16:26] put yourself in those scriptures.
[16:28] Amen. The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[16:30] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[16:33] servants things which must shortly come
[16:34] to pass. And he sent and signified it by
[16:37] his angel unto his servant John. Amen.
[16:40] Who bear record of the word of God and
[16:42] of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[16:45] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[16:48] that readeth.
[16:48] Amen.
[16:49] And they that hear the words of this
[16:51] prophecy, and keep those things which
[16:53] are written therein, for the time is at
[16:56] hand. How many believe that?
[16:58] John to the seven churches which are in
[17:01] Asia. Remember, John is a type of of the
[17:03] bride. Grace be unto you and peace from
[17:06] him which is and which was and which is
[17:08] to come and from the seven spirits which
[17:11] are before his throne. And from Jesus
[17:14] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[17:16] the first begotten of the dead and the
[17:18] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[17:20] him that loved us and washed us from our
[17:23] sins in his own blood.
[17:26] Amen. He didn't use no one else's blood
[17:28] in his own blood. What a great God. and
[17:31] hath made us kings and priests unto unto
[17:35] God and his father and to him be glory
[17:39] and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[17:42] Amen.
[17:43] Amen. Let's just bow our heads this
[17:44] evening. Our heavenly father, we just
[17:46] thank you once again for the opportunity
[17:48] to open back the pages of your word. We
[17:51] ask you for first and foremost to
[17:52] forgive us for our sins, Lord. When
[17:54] whatever way we've failed you, Lord,
[17:57] Lord, we ask that you'd cleanse us,
[17:58] Lord. and let's just place it under the
[18:01] blood of Jesus Christ. Help us to
[18:02] receive from your word. Let me say it.
[18:04] Lay aside, Lord, and you use my lips to
[18:07] speak to your people, Lord. And Father,
[18:09] may you just continue to be with Brother
[18:10] Dale, Lord. Continue to strengthen him,
[18:13] strengthen Nanny, Lord God. Bless her,
[18:15] Lord Jesus, and the family, Lord. And
[18:17] Father, all the sick ones amongst us,
[18:19] even those that are traveling, Lord. May
[18:21] you just watch over them. Keep them safe
[18:23] on the roads. And we commit the rest of
[18:25] the service into your hands. in Jesus
[18:27] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[18:30] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[18:37] Amen. I want to start with this quote
[18:38] here and I appreciate the brothers
[18:40] bringing those up back there.
[18:44] Brother Brandham says in the revelation
[18:46] of Jesus Christ in 1960, he says, "And
[18:48] notice it also is the consummation of
[18:52] the scriptures, the complete
[18:54] consummation." Amen.
[18:56] Amen. And it's geographically placed at
[18:59] the right place
[19:01] at the end of the Bible.
[19:03] Amen.
[19:04] So, so, so he's talking about the book
[19:06] of Revelation is geographically placed
[19:09] at the end of the Bible. Remember,
[19:11] there's two books that Satan hates the
[19:12] most. Which are those two books?
[19:15] It's the book of Genesis and the book of
[19:17] Revelation
[19:18] because it exposes Satan in such a way
[19:20] he hates he hates it.
[19:22] That's right, brother.
[19:23] But as brother Brandon said, we love it.
[19:25] Amen. Amen.
[19:26] We love revelation. Amen. And so I not
[19:30] not too many people nowadays talk about
[19:32] revelation. Amen. But revelation is very
[19:34] important in the believer's life.
[19:36] Because you can be reading the
[19:38] scriptures physically and not really
[19:40] know what it's saying.
[19:42] I mean, you can read Matthew chap 28:19
[19:46] that says, "Go ye into all the world
[19:47] baptized in the name of the father, son,
[19:50] and holy ghost." And that's what you go
[19:52] do. But in reality, that is not what
[19:55] Jesus was telling you to do.
[19:57] Amen.
[19:57] Because Peter later on and several days
[19:59] later, he he completely disobey
[20:03] supposedly what Jesus had told him to
[20:06] do. He baptizes all them 3,000 in the
[20:08] name of Jesus.
[20:09] Amen.
[20:10] So, so, so, so and Jesus had given him
[20:12] the keys to the kingdom.
[20:14] And there yet he goes to disobeying
[20:16] Jesus Christ. That is that's that that's
[20:19] a con the the the word then would be in
[20:22] confusion.
[20:23] But this that's the thing is is that we
[20:25] need revelation when we read the word
[20:27] and revelation only comes by the Holy
[20:29] Ghost.
[20:30] That's why it's so important for us to
[20:32] know
[20:33] Sister Susan so good to see.
[20:36] That's why it's so important to know
[20:38] that we have the Holy Spirit.
[20:40] Amen.
[20:41] That you are truly born again.
[20:42] Amen. Because if you if you are not you
[20:45] will not understand the scriptures and
[20:47] you will you will see it as just a
[20:50] common old book and you you won't you
[20:53] won't think about revelation in the way
[20:56] that you do when when revelation is
[20:58] prevalent in your life. Amen.
[21:00] And revelation is very important in a
[21:02] believer's life. Amen. So so the the
[21:05] quote continues saying and it's
[21:06] geographically placed at the right place
[21:09] at the end of the Bible. the revelation
[21:11] of the whole thing placed back here with
[21:13] a blessing to who reads it and hears it.
[21:16] So if you can't read, Amen. You're
[21:18] blessed to hear.
[21:19] And if you can't hear, you're blessed to
[21:21] read.
[21:22] Praise God. There's no excuse.
[21:23] That's right.
[21:25] With a curse to them that'll that'll add
[21:28] to or take away.
[21:30] It's the complete cannon. Oh, the
[21:32] absolute.
[21:33] That's right.
[21:34] I believe that with all my heart.
[21:35] Amen.
[21:36] Nothing can be added to it. And watch
[21:38] this. And when a man tries to take
[21:40] anything away from it or add anything to
[21:43] it, God said he'd take the same part out
[21:46] of the book of life. See,
[21:48] he would take his part from the book if
[21:50] he added to it. Therefore, when we see
[21:53] the manifold revelation of our Lord, who
[21:56] he is, what he is, if any person shall
[21:59] add something to that or take anything
[22:01] away from it, it's a false prophecy.
[22:05] Amen. Uh-huh.
[22:06] So when you when you when you read a
[22:09] scripture and you look at it and you're
[22:11] looking at it through the lens of not
[22:14] revelation, but you start looking at it
[22:16] through your own lens,
[22:17] you're adding to the word.
[22:18] Amen. Right?
[22:19] Or you're taking from the word.
[22:21] Amen.
[22:22] Many have tried to say they have they
[22:24] they had something later than than that.
[22:27] But that is the complete revelation of
[22:30] Lord Jesus in his church age and in his
[22:32] day. A revelation of our Lord. Praise
[22:34] the Lord.
[22:35] Amen.
[22:35] They continue saying in the revelation
[22:37] of Jesus Christ, the importance of
[22:39] revelation by the spirit to a true
[22:41] believer can never be emphasized.
[22:45] Amen.
[22:45] Amen.
[22:46] It can never be emphasized. Is is so
[22:49] important that we live by revelation.
[22:51] And we all know this.
[22:53] Amen.
[22:53] Yes, sir.
[22:55] But sometimes we try to put our own
[22:57] thing into it and then it it it doesn't
[23:00] work that way. Amen. Amen.
[23:02] Revelation means more to you than
[23:04] perhaps you realize.
[23:06] Now I am not talking about this book of
[23:08] revelation and you I am talking about
[23:11] all revelation. It is tremendously
[23:13] important to the church.
[23:15] That's right.
[23:16] Amen. We take the example for for
[23:18] example when when Jesus Christ asked the
[23:20] disciples who the man say that I the son
[23:23] of man am
[23:25] and and they all said different things
[23:27] but then Peter said thou art the Christ
[23:29] the son of the living God. Amen.
[23:31] Amen.
[23:32] Now, it was a revelation. Jesus said, "I
[23:36] uh
[23:37] on this on this word or this this is
[23:40] I'll build my church and the gates of
[23:42] hell cannot
[23:43] cannot prevail against it." Amen. It was
[23:45] a revelation.
[23:45] He did.
[23:46] He said flesh and blood didn't teach it
[23:48] to him. My father which is in heaven and
[23:50] Jesus Christ, I mean Peter without the
[23:52] new birth was able to have that.
[23:54] Think about that. Amen.
[23:56] So it's important. I mean, if it was
[23:59] important even even before he had gotten
[24:01] the new birth, how much more now with
[24:02] the new birth?
[24:04] You've got to have revelation in your
[24:05] life.
[24:06] Amen.
[24:06] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[24:07] Amen.
[24:07] Amen. Now, what is and brother Brandon
[24:10] continue saying here, the church is
[24:12] built on revelation on the dust, said
[24:14] the Lord. That was the last part of that
[24:16] quote
[24:17] and it that's what it that's what that's
[24:18] what is built. Now, the word revelation
[24:20] comes from the word apocalypses.
[24:22] Y
[24:23] that's how you say it in Spanish, right?
[24:25] So, I'm sure that kind of sounds like in
[24:26] Greek as well, right?
[24:29] that Greek Greek and Spanish almost
[24:31] sound alike in many different ways. So
[24:33] I'm saying saying in Spanish I'm almost
[24:35] speaking Greek too.
[24:38] Apocalypses
[24:39] and it means revelation be re to be
[24:42] revealed to lighten to manifestation
[24:45] coming and appearing.
[24:47] Amen.
[24:48] Amen.
[24:48] All right.
[24:49] Praise the Lord. So revelation is
[24:51] something that was previously hidden.
[24:53] But then when somebody somebody if we
[24:56] put a tarp over this and every new
[24:58] people were coming in, they maybe not
[25:00] know what it is. But as soon as we take
[25:02] that tarp off now it's revealed what is
[25:05] under that tarp. Amen.
[25:07] And it's a pull pit. And there is no
[25:09] denying it.
[25:10] That's right. When you see it,
[25:12] right when you see it.
[25:13] That's right, brother.
[25:14] There is no deny. You You can't unsee
[25:17] what you see. Right. Right.
[25:19] That's why I don't understand why how
[25:21] people can leave this word.
[25:22] Yeah.
[25:24] How can you leave this word when you've
[25:26] seen it?
[25:27] How can I say this isn't a pulpit when I
[25:29] know that it's a pulpit and I actually
[25:31] came over here and touched it and I see
[25:33] all the attributes of it.
[25:34] Amen.
[25:36] You know it's a pulpit because you saw
[25:37] it with your very own eyes and and you
[25:40] know it's the word of God and it's a
[25:41] revelation in your life. You know it's
[25:43] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[25:44] Christ. You know it's one God because
[25:46] you saw it with your spiritual eyes.
[25:48] Amen.
[25:48] Amen.
[25:49] And it's that's a revelation to you.
[25:51] Just when I came into the word, Amen.
[25:54] into the message, nobody can take take
[25:56] me back. Amen. From seeing one God
[25:59] that's just ingrained in me so so much.
[26:02] I can't unsee that.
[26:03] Amen.
[26:05] It's hard to.
[26:06] Amen.
[26:07] That's a revelation of God.
[26:09] Amen.
[26:10] That's what revelation does to you.
[26:12] Amen. So when something pops out to you
[26:14] from the word Amen. And I know that each
[26:16] and one of us, God deals with us in
[26:18] different ways. Some scriptures pop out
[26:20] to us more than others. Amen.
[26:22] It's how God deals with us.
[26:24] But once that pops out to you, I mean,
[26:27] you can't unsee that.
[26:28] No, brother.
[26:29] It's it's becomes real.
[26:31] Amen. That's why it's so important that
[26:33] we take the scripture and we look at it
[26:34] and we give it the importance that that
[26:36] that it deserves because for one is the
[26:38] word of God and two I mean it is the
[26:42] it's a it could become I mean that that
[26:45] personal to you. Amen.
[26:47] And as we're partaking of the word amen
[26:49] we're becoming the word.
[26:51] Remember that.
[26:52] Amen.
[26:53] As we read the word we're becoming more
[26:54] like the word.
[26:56] At least we should be.
[26:58] Praise the Lord.
[26:59] Many people just read the the the
[27:01] scriptures as just I'm doing my daily
[27:03] devotional for today.
[27:04] Yeah.
[27:05] I'll do my 10 15 minutes and that's
[27:06] about it.
[27:08] And never get up from that chair or
[27:10] wherever they are from half asleep in
[27:11] the bed, you know, trying to do their
[27:14] devotion on their iPad.
[27:15] Yeah.
[27:17] And never get something out of that
[27:19] word.
[27:20] Right. Come on, brother.
[27:20] And you just read the word of God.
[27:23] That's why we need to ask God for
[27:25] revelation.
[27:26] A revelation is important, saints.
[27:29] Amen. Now, even Jesus had to grow in
[27:32] revelation. Did you know that?
[27:34] Look what the scripture says.
[27:36] Amen. I mean, him being having the
[27:38] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelling
[27:40] within him.
[27:41] He didn't know all things,
[27:42] right?
[27:44] The scripture says that.
[27:45] Oh, that sounds weird. That sounds
[27:47] strange, doesn't it?
[27:48] Brother Brandon said that. And the
[27:50] scripture declares that.
[27:52] Look what John 5:19 says. Then answered
[27:55] Jesus and said unto them, "Verily,
[27:57] verily, I say unto you, the Son can do
[28:00] nothing
[28:00] of himself."
[28:02] Right?
[28:03] But what he seeth the Father do.
[28:06] Right. Right.
[28:07] So he Jesus was walking around here on
[28:09] earth not he he he couldn't go do
[28:13] something unless he saw it from the
[28:14] father first.
[28:15] Amen.
[28:16] He was human just as much as he was God.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:19] But that human element was working
[28:20] there. Amen. So he didn't know all
[28:22] things in the human in the human part.
[28:25] But when God came on the scene, Amen. he
[28:27] knew what he was doing.
[28:29] Praise the Lord.
[28:30] Because remember, he had to be a type uh
[28:32] for us.
[28:33] He had to be an example for us.
[28:35] Us now with the Holy Ghost,
[28:38] us now. Amen. With the son of man inside
[28:41] of us. Amen.
[28:42] Right, brother?
[28:43] He had to exemplify that first.
[28:46] Amen.
[28:47] You see what I'm saying? And so that's
[28:49] how we work. We are not going to move
[28:51] unless the scripture tells us so.
[28:53] Amen.
[28:54] We can't move unless the scripture shows
[28:56] us first.
[28:57] And that was the same thing with God
[28:59] with with Jesus. He couldn't move. He
[29:01] couldn't go see the the the uh uh heal
[29:04] blind Barnameus or or go talk to the
[29:06] woman at the well unless God showed him
[29:08] first.
[29:09] Right.
[29:10] Then he could say, "I must go needs by
[29:13] go by Samaria."
[29:14] Right. Amen.
[29:15] I believe God showed him.
[29:16] Amen. Right.
[29:17] Amen.
[29:18] Amen.
[29:18] Yeah. Absolutely. So that's the same
[29:20] thing with with you and I. John 15:15,
[29:22] "Henceforth I call you not servants, but
[29:25] for the servant knoweth not what his
[29:28] lord doeth, but I have called you
[29:30] friends, for all things that I have
[29:32] heard of my father, I have made known
[29:34] unto you."
[29:35] Amen.
[29:36] So all things
[29:38] all things, of course, there was more
[29:40] things to come later on. So it wasn't
[29:43] all things there, but everything that he
[29:45] knew at the time he was he was with he
[29:48] wanted to share it with his disciples
[29:50] and with us.
[29:51] Matthew 11:27, "All things are delivered
[29:54] unto me of my father."
[29:57] Amen. And no man knoweth the Son, but
[29:59] the Father, neither knoweth any man the
[30:02] Father, save the Son,
[30:04] and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
[30:07] him.
[30:08] Amen.
[30:08] Amen. Now see, so he was limited in what
[30:11] he knew at that time. Amen. But when he
[30:13] came up out of the grave on that third
[30:15] day, Amen. He said, "All power is given
[30:18] unto me both in heaven and on earth."
[30:21] Amen. He knew all things then.
[30:24] And that same power he gives to you and
[30:26] I, saints.
[30:27] Amen. Via the Holy Spirit. Amen. You
[30:30] have that same power. Amen. In this
[30:32] hour,
[30:33] to know exactly what you want, what he
[30:36] wants done with his word.
[30:38] Amen.
[30:39] Praise God.
[30:40] Amen.
[30:40] Now, I know there's there's a there's a
[30:42] time, amen, that that that adoption,
[30:44] Amen, has to come in part. And that's
[30:46] definitely a time when you know all
[30:49] things,
[30:49] right, brother?
[30:50] Amen. You're a superman then.
[30:53] And we're we're coming to that. Amen.
[30:55] But the spirit of adoption is working in
[30:56] us right now.
[30:58] Amen.
[30:58] Amen. And even if it's in little
[30:59] portion, Amen. It's still God.
[31:02] All right.
[31:03] And we still can tap to into it.
[31:05] Amen. We still can tap in that same that
[31:08] same Holy Ghost. We still can tap into
[31:10] that same God. Amen. Lord, what should I
[31:12] do with this situation? Lord, what what
[31:15] my my my children, this situation, this,
[31:17] that, and that. You tap into what God
[31:18] has already given you.
[31:21] Into that power.
[31:23] Oh, no. I'll just do it in the
[31:24] millennium. It'll be too late then.
[31:26] Amen.
[31:27] Amen. He wants us to tap into it now.
[31:30] Amen. cuz you have the power cuz he said
[31:32] all power is given unto me both in
[31:34] heaven and in earth. And are you part of
[31:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ?
[31:39] You are part of his body. You are flesh
[31:41] of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of
[31:43] his life. Amen.
[31:45] So everything that he owns, you own.
[31:47] Amen.
[31:49] I mean, I gave the example this weekend
[31:50] of my wife. I am a I am joint I'm I am
[31:54] an he's an heir. I'm an heir and joint
[31:57] heir with Jesus Christ.
[32:00] And when I get married to Christine,
[32:01] Amen. Everything that I owned when I was
[32:04] single belonged to her now.
[32:07] I could not keep my own bank account
[32:09] anymore.
[32:11] Yeah. You're not supposed to.
[32:12] No, you're not.
[32:13] That's right, brother. Preach, brother.
[32:14] Preach.
[32:16] Preach.
[32:16] Because that causes problems.
[32:19] That actually causes temptations.
[32:21] Amen.
[32:22] To go do things with your own money that
[32:24] you're not supposed to be doing.
[32:26] Preach.
[32:28] So everything that that was mine and
[32:30] everything that was hers, we joined
[32:32] together.
[32:32] Absolutely. Amen.
[32:34] Into one.
[32:35] So my table is her table.
[32:38] Amen.
[32:38] My bed is her bed.
[32:40] Amen.
[32:41] My car is her car.
[32:43] Everything that I own is mine. But
[32:45] people nowadays don't think that way.
[32:47] They think, "Oh, I better I better be
[32:50] careful. I just don't fully trust him or
[32:52] her. So, I don't know if we should do
[32:54] that or not."
[32:54] Come on, brother.
[32:55] What are you thinking? Why? Why'd you
[32:56] get married then?
[32:57] That's right.
[32:58] To get divorced, brother.
[33:00] Amen. You're not You're not unsure of
[33:02] what you're doing.
[33:03] But when you're sure what you're doing,
[33:05] Amen. you join up everything. Amen.
[33:08] Everything that is his is mine.
[33:10] Everything that's mine belongs to her.
[33:12] Amen.
[33:13] I have full confidence with her. I can
[33:14] give her a debit card and I know she
[33:16] ain't going to spend it at at at Sears
[33:19] or or or
[33:21] wherever she likes to go.
[33:25] She don't she don't she's not a shopper.
[33:27] She's not much of a shopper.
[33:29] But I can just have confidence in her
[33:33] knowing she ain't going to go over spend
[33:34] my money. And Jesus Christ has the same
[33:36] confidence in you and me. When you're
[33:39] fully born, when you're fully part of
[33:41] his body,
[33:41] y
[33:42] when you've really joined with up with
[33:44] him
[33:44] and fully part of that revelation,
[33:47] Amen. He can have confidence in you.
[33:50] Give you the checkbook.
[33:51] Absolutely. Yeah.
[33:53] You write the check.
[33:54] Amen.
[33:55] Right.
[33:56] Praise God.
[33:57] Because all everything belongs to him.
[33:59] Amen.
[33:59] Even the cattle on a thousand heels.
[34:02] He said,
[34:03] "Man,
[34:03] he ain't poor."
[34:04] No.
[34:05] Amen. Praise God. But sometimes we walk
[34:09] around in a poor in a poor man's
[34:10] mentality, though.
[34:11] We do, brother.
[34:12] Amen.
[34:13] Like, I got to I got to walk like this
[34:15] cuz I got to be humble.
[34:17] Come on, babe. You know, God saved me
[34:21] and Christ has given you the power over
[34:23] all power of the enemy.
[34:25] And we walk around like we're defeated.
[34:27] Yeah.
[34:28] Amen.
[34:30] Praise the Lord Jesus. All right. Let me
[34:31] get off that now.
[34:32] Good.
[34:34] Now, so Jesus didn't know all things.
[34:36] But let me let me let's see what Brother
[34:38] Brandon said. He said now in the
[34:40] revelation of Jesus Christ he continues
[34:41] saying now I said that this book of
[34:44] revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[34:46] and what he is doing in the church for
[34:48] the seven ages
[34:50] right
[34:52] it is a revelation because the disciples
[34:54] themselves didn't know these recorded
[34:57] truths
[34:58] it had not been previously revealed to
[35:00] them you remember that they came to
[35:02] Jesus in the book of acts and asked him
[35:03] are you at this time going to restore
[35:05] the kingdom to Israel and he said it is
[35:08] not for you to know the times or the
[35:10] seasons. Those men were still thinking
[35:12] of Jesus having an earthly kingdom
[35:15] because they were Jews and they were
[35:17] wanting the the the Romans to be stomped
[35:19] out. So when they were looking for the
[35:21] Messiah, they were thinking that the
[35:23] Messiah was going to come and just trod
[35:26] them out and stomp them on out of
[35:28] Jerusalem. But that's not what Jesus the
[35:31] Messiah came to do.
[35:33] He wasn't starting an earthly kingdom.
[35:34] He was starting a heavenly kingdom
[35:36] first.
[35:37] Amen. The earthly kingdom comes later
[35:40] after the spiritual kingdom is
[35:42] established first. That's the
[35:44] foundation.
[35:45] But it was a spiritual kingdom that he
[35:46] was going to build. Even he could not
[35:49] tell them about his place in it.
[35:51] Watch. Look at that. Even he could not
[35:54] tell them about his place in it for the
[35:57] father had not revealed it unto him.
[35:59] Amen.
[36:01] Very interesting.
[36:02] Right.
[36:04] But now after his death and resurrection
[36:07] and at this particular time and his
[36:09] mediatorial
[36:11] ministry, he is able to set forth here
[36:14] in this revelation of himself to John
[36:17] what his glory and presence in the
[36:19] church would mean and do.
[36:21] Absolutely.
[36:22] That's why in in the book of Revelations
[36:24] that we just read there in chapter one,
[36:26] we read the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[36:29] Right?
[36:29] Jesus Christ had a revelation.
[36:32] Amen.
[36:33] Praise God.
[36:34] And we are part of that revelation.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:37] Amen.
[36:39] Now,
[36:41] so if Jesus had all power both in heaven
[36:44] and earth, and if we were in him when he
[36:47] died and rose again,
[36:50] then why are we not now manifesting the
[36:52] same power that he has?
[36:56] Think about that.
[36:59] Let me read that again. I wrote this
[37:01] down. So if Jesus had all power both in
[37:04] heaven and earth, which we know he does
[37:07] cuz he declared it when he resurrected,
[37:09] right?
[37:10] And if we were in him when he died and
[37:12] rose again, then why are we not now
[37:15] manifesting that same power that he has?
[37:18] Amen.
[37:19] Right, buddy?
[37:20] Amen.
[37:20] Exactly.
[37:21] Cuz remember the children of Israel,
[37:23] they were given the land
[37:26] before they actually possessed the land.
[37:28] Right.
[37:29] Amen.
[37:29] Right.
[37:30] Yep. The children of Israel were
[37:32] promised even even to Abraham many years
[37:35] before they were promised that they
[37:36] would they would inhabit a land that was
[37:39] flowing with milk and honey.
[37:41] And so that land belonged to them.
[37:43] Praise God. It's the same thing with us
[37:45] in this hour, saints. Amen. We are
[37:48] promised this land. We are promised a
[37:50] body change. Amen.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:52] Oh, we don't see it right now.
[37:55] We don't see it, but we're getting
[37:56] there. As brother Wade says,
[37:57] amen.
[37:59] Amen. Little by little. Amen. Whatever
[38:02] is man, whatever is inside is
[38:04] manifesting on the outside.
[38:06] It don't look like it. You think it
[38:08] looked like it when the children of
[38:09] Israel were walking through the
[38:10] wilderness and having to march around
[38:12] the walls of Jericho
[38:15] and and and it it didn't look like that
[38:17] they were they seemed probably felt like
[38:20] they were slaves.
[38:21] Yeah, that's right.
[38:22] Yeah.
[38:23] Why is God telling us to march around
[38:25] the wall? We just did it yesterday.
[38:28] Yeah. We got to do it again. Yeah, you
[38:30] got to do it again.
[38:32] And you're going to do it tomorrow, too.
[38:34] You're going to go to church Wednesday
[38:36] and you're going to go to church next
[38:38] Sunday and you're going to go to church.
[38:40] You're going to continue doing remember
[38:42] the mundane.
[38:44] Until the mundane becomes a reality
[38:47] until something happens.
[38:50] Praise God.
[38:51] Well, this is boring,
[38:52] but that's what God said to domen
[38:55] through Joshua, who is our Holy Spirit.
[38:57] Amen.
[38:58] Amen.
[39:00] Yep.
[39:00] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost,
[39:02] right?
[39:02] Amen. That's right.
[39:03] And that's what Joshua commanded.
[39:06] But you know what? They kept going and
[39:08] they kept going. And it's the same thing
[39:10] with us. Amen. But they had that promise
[39:12] there in their forefront.
[39:14] Yeah. Amen.
[39:15] You know, maybe one of them maybe they'd
[39:16] be marching and and they'd probably
[39:18] they're, you know, just just marching
[39:20] around and and the goodness, look at
[39:22] them. They're over there looking at us,
[39:24] man. I bet you them young people,
[39:26] they're probably like,
[39:27] "Yeah, come on now,
[39:28] man. This is embarrassing."
[39:30] Yeah.

[40:40] You test a revelation or you test a
[40:43] doctrine by your new birth.
[40:45] That's right.
[40:46] Right. That's right.
[40:48] Look at your life.
[40:49] Right. Look where you've been and look
[40:51] where you are.
[40:53] Look, has there been a change in your
[40:55] life? You're not the same person that
[40:56] you used to be
[40:58] 10 years ago, 15 years ago,
[41:00] 20 years ago. Something took place.
[41:02] Amen.
[41:03] Where one time you liked to do these
[41:05] things and you and you enjoyed
[41:08] uh uh being vulgar and and and and and
[41:12] just enjoying the world, but now
[41:14] something happened.

[41:18] Amen. Right?
[41:19] You know,
[41:20] right?
[41:20] Amen. God's working in you.
[41:22] Amen.
[41:23] God's made a change. And I I I can
[41:24] imagine these these the the children of
[41:26] Israel just walking around and marching
[41:28] around the the walls of Jericho's
[41:30] thinking like this. Amen.
[41:32] But that's why we why why aren't we
[41:34] manifesting that same power right now?
[41:36] Amen. We're growing into the stature of
[41:38] a perfect man.
[41:39] That's right, brother.
[41:40] Praise God.
[41:41] Amen.
[41:41] So the the the the the
[41:44] we are given the spirit. Amen. As a down
[41:47] payment.
[41:47] That's right. Amen.
[41:48] Right. The Holy Spirit is given to us as
[41:50] a down payment. Amen. And the down
[41:52] payment, Amen, lets you get the car.
[41:57] It lets you bring the car from the lot.
[41:59] Those of us who make car payments, you

[42:12] move into the house,
[42:13] right? Manager,

[42:16] but in reality, that house doesn't

[42:19] Neither does that car.
[42:21] Amen.
[42:23] You got to keep paying.
[42:24] You got to continue paying your way.
[42:26] You got to continue doing what you're
[42:28] supposed to do. Amen. And eventually,
[42:29] you'll get the title. Amen. Praise God.
[42:32] And so, God's given us a down payment.
[42:34] Amen. It's working inside. Amen. But
[42:36] it's got to take this constant Amen.
[42:38] moving and reading, studying,
[42:40] meditating. Amen. Living the life of
[42:42] Christ, praying. Amen.
[42:44] Yeah.
[42:44] Praise God. And eventually it'll become
[42:47] one day, oh my goodness, I'm
[42:49] Praise the Lord. Start doing the that
[42:51] that dance and singing the way brother
[42:53] Juel, that song that he sings. Um, one
[42:57] day I'm going to
[42:58] Yeah. Won't it be a time? Amen. Praise
[43:01] the Lord. Amen. That body change is
[43:03] coming, saints.
[43:04] And it's not it's not a the Bible talks
[43:07] about it.
[43:08] So it's not a fairy tale.
[43:10] Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, let's move
[43:13] on. I said I wasn't going to keep y'all.
[43:14] I'm I'm having fun, though.
[43:17] Christ Christ is revealed in his own
[43:19] word. Brother Brandon says, "Now, the
[43:21] same thing is this. If you are a son of
[43:24] God and if I am a son of God or a
[43:28] daughter of God, we were in God at the
[43:31] beginning."
[43:32] All right?
[43:34] And when Jesus became,
[43:37] watch that now. And when Jesus became
[43:40] the fullness of the word
[43:43] that's that's interesting that wording
[43:45] there what then we were in him germ form
[43:50] now that doesn't mean that he didn't
[43:52] come go as God when he came here to
[43:55] earth the Bible declares him that he was
[43:57] God. Amen.
[44:00] He was uh uh um how does the Isaiah say
[44:04] it? Emanuel. God with us.
[44:07] Praise the Lord.
[44:08] So otherwise then the man Isaiah was
[44:11] lying then
[44:12] if he wasn't God he was God.
[44:14] Amen.
[44:15] But again Jesus the Bible says that he
[44:18] grew in revelation and stature
[44:22] just like you and me are growing. Amen.
[44:24] So that I believe is what brother
[44:26] Brandham is referring to. And when Jesus
[44:28] became the fullness of the word then we
[44:30] were in him germ form. When he was
[44:33] crucified, we was crucified in his body.
[44:37] Amen.
[44:38] Believe that.
[44:38] Spiritually.
[44:39] Amen.
[44:39] Amen.
[44:40] In the eternal life there. Amen. When he
[44:43] arose from the dead, we rose with him.
[44:46] Amen.
[44:46] Amen. We didn't phys we were not
[44:48] physically attached to him. No. Amen.
[44:51] But in spiritually speaking. Amen.
[44:55] That's why we are now Amen. sitting in
[44:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[45:00] And now since we have recognized it, now
[45:02] we set together with him. There it goes.
[45:04] Brother Brham saying it in heavenly
[45:06] places in Christ Jesus. See, for we he
[45:08] we if we are sons and daughters of God,
[45:11] we are God's children.
[45:13] Then we are attributes of God.
[45:17] Now the key thing there is if we are
[45:19] sons and daughters of God,
[45:21] then we are God's attributes. Amen.
[45:23] Then we were God. Then we were God
[45:26] eternal life. And God is the only
[45:29] eternal life there is.
[45:32] Then we were in him from the beginning.
[45:35] We were in him from the beginning. And
[45:37] when Jesus became all that word, there
[45:40] he says that phrase again.
[45:42] Then we were a part of him then.
[45:44] Amen.
[45:45] Amen. There you are. When that's in
[45:48] there, there is no devil, no powers, no
[45:51] nothing can ever move it.
[45:53] That's the typost of the soul.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:55] Praise the Lord Jesus. Right.
[45:56] Amen.
[45:58] So we were in him. Amen.
[46:01] We weren't manifested physically. No.
[46:03] N.
[46:04] But we were in his thinking. Otherwise
[46:05] that he wouldn't have gone to do what he
[46:08] did for us. Amen.
[46:10] We were in him
[46:12] when he when he when he was crucified.
[46:14] We were in him when he rose from the
[46:16] dead. Amen.
[46:19] And then in another place he says, "But
[46:21] his soul is his germ." That well let me
[46:23] just read that from the Larosian church
[46:25] age. naked, blind, miserable, don't even
[46:27] know it. See, it's out. It's that
[46:28] anointed, anointed with the real spirit.
[46:30] See, that Holy Spirit can fall upon a
[46:32] man in his spirit, but his soul is his
[46:35] germ.
[46:36] That germ is the word.
[46:39] Amen, brother.
[46:40] I like that. But his soul is his germ.
[46:43] Amen.
[46:43] And that germ is the word. Amen. That's
[46:46] the word is the seed. Praise God.
[46:49] True, brother.
[46:51] And we we we all know this. Listen,
[46:53] brother, brother Wade, he's he's been
[46:54] covering this uh lately with regards to
[46:57] the seed. Amen. There is no other seed
[47:00] but the word.
[47:01] Amen.
[47:02] There is no other seed but the word of
[47:04] God. Amen. And when that's planted in
[47:06] you, Amen. that has to take life.
[47:09] Only if it's watered by the same type of
[47:12] the same water. Amen.
[47:13] Right.
[47:15] Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, I don't know
[47:16] if the brothers they they I sent them a
[47:18] picture, but I don't know if they they
[47:21] got it or not. they were able to copy it
[47:22] over or not. When we're looking at the
[47:25] uh at the uh because revelation comes in
[47:27] layers. Amen.
[47:29] Praise God. There's the there's the
[47:30] tabernacle.
[47:32] Yeah, they got it good.
[47:35] And so we see that that the tabernacle
[47:37] had multiple layers. Amen.
[47:40] Amen.
[47:41] And each layer, you can go back and read
[47:43] it represented different things. Amen.
[47:46] But it was as as you would you would
[47:49] peel those layers back. Amen. You would
[47:52] see what was further under and under and
[47:54] closer to what the tabernacle was really
[47:57] housing. Amen.
[47:58] Praise the Lord Jesus. And and so
[48:00] revelation comes in layers. Amen.
[48:04] The more you It's like an onion peel
[48:05] like brother Wade has said before. Amen.
[48:07] It's it's it it the more you peel back,
[48:10] Amen. the more you you see of what's
[48:12] inside. Amen. Praise God. So that is
[48:15] that that is what the tabernacle and the
[48:17] people of the people out there in in the
[48:20] world didn't know what was inside. Amen.
[48:22] Because of all those layers, right,
[48:24] brother.
[48:25] Amen. But the high priest, Amen. He knew
[48:27] what was in there.
[48:29] Amen.
[48:29] Because he had a personal revelation of
[48:32] what he saw, what he he knew exactly
[48:34] what was in there.
[48:36] And that's what we need to do. Amen. In
[48:37] this hour, amen. be able to go back into
[48:39] that holies of holies and have a true
[48:42] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ to
[48:44] really know him beyond a shadow of the
[48:46] doubt that you've met him and that you
[48:47] know that he is. Praise God.
[48:49] Amen.
[48:51] Young people, it's important in this
[48:52] hour. Amen. That you know beyond a
[48:55] shadow of doubt
[48:56] that you are born again.
[48:58] Amen.
[48:59] That you are truly Amen. sealed by the
[49:01] Holy Spirit. that that you really know
[49:05] that the scriptures that script you are
[49:08] part of that word. Amen.
[49:09] And that that word is in you and it's
[49:12] not just a routine or it's not just I
[49:15] have to do this,
[49:16] man. But it's something it's a reality.
[49:18] Amen. Praise God.
[49:21] So what is the revelation of Jesus
[49:23] Christ?
[49:26] Now I know I apologize for reading a lot
[49:29] of quotes this evening, but
[49:30] All right. Go ahead.
[49:33] I think I I haven't been reading much
[49:34] lately, so I'm making up for today.
[49:37] Amen. Amen. Okay.
[49:41] Prophet says here, "So the Bible is the
[49:44] complete revelation of Jesus Christ.
[49:47] And it was wrote by prophets." Hebrews
[49:50] 1:1. And God who in sun time spake to
[49:53] the fathers by the prophets. We we know
[49:54] that. Let's continue here. Jesus was
[49:57] Malachi. Yep.
[49:58] Jesus was Jeremiah. Isaiah, Elijah,
[50:03] all that they were were in him.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:06] Amen.
[50:07] I didn't say it. Brother Brham said
[50:09] all that they were. Because why? When
[50:11] they would prophesy about Jesus Christ,
[50:14] Amen. Brother Brandon says in one point
[50:16] they were building the body of Jesus.
[50:19] Amen. They were bringing up Amen. to
[50:21] eventually Jesus Christ would come into
[50:23] manifestation the way he did. Amen.
[50:26] Right.
[50:26] So it was Jesus through Malachi.
[50:29] Amen. Now, we know that they didn't have
[50:31] the Holy Spirit and they could not have
[50:33] the Holy Spirit like you and I have it
[50:35] today. But it was still the spirit of
[50:36] God prophesying through them
[50:38] because it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't
[50:40] their word. It was God's word.
[50:42] Jesus was Malachi. Jesus was Jeremiah,
[50:45] Isaiah, Elijah. All that they were were
[50:48] in him.
[50:50] All and all that you are and all I am is
[50:54] in him.
[50:55] Amen. Right.
[50:56] I like this. Words, witnesses of the
[50:59] word.
[50:59] Amen.
[51:00] Amen.
[51:01] Amen.
[51:01] I I want to be that. Amen.
[51:04] I want to be word bought. I want to be
[51:06] word owned. I want to be I want to I
[51:09] want to be a witness of the word.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:12] Not a witness of the world.
[51:14] That's right.
[51:15] Witness of the word.
[51:17] Praise God.
[51:18] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[51:19] Amen.
[51:20] So, it is not a book of systems, a code,
[51:22] moral ethics. Neither is it a histo
[51:24] history book or a book of theology. It
[51:26] is not. But it's a revelation of Jesus
[51:29] Christ.
[51:29] Amen.
[51:30] God himself revealed from word to flesh.
[51:32] That's what it is.
[51:34] The Bible is the word and God is the
[51:37] flesh.
[51:38] God God in the word rather and Jesus
[51:40] being the flesh. It's the revelation how
[51:42] God the word was manifested in human
[51:44] flesh
[51:45] and revealed to us. Praise God.
[51:47] Amen.
[51:48] Amen. You can't be a witness of
[51:50] something if you don't know what it is.
[51:52] Amen.
[51:53] Amen. You can't be a witness that you
[51:55] saw this pullpit here today if you
[51:58] didn't see it.
[51:59] N
[52:00] Amen. You can't be a witness of an
[52:02] experience in your life when you really
[52:04] haven't had that experience.
[52:07] Right. Right.
[52:08] And the world out here is thirsting to
[52:10] see Jesus Christ.
[52:12] I believe that with all my heart.
[52:15] But when you can't when you haven't seen
[52:18] him or have experienced him with your
[52:20] with your own life, you can't be a
[52:22] witness of that. Amen.
[52:24] It's hard.
[52:26] Now, you're a witness of what you know.
[52:28] Amen.
[52:29] If you know basketball or if you know
[52:32] drawing or if you know uh cooking or if
[52:35] you know that you could be a witness of
[52:36] that because you know that
[52:39] you you experienced it and and and and
[52:41] you know how to do it. You know how to
[52:43] handle it.
[52:44] You know how to chop onions in the way
[52:46] that don't make you cry.
[52:49] You know how to do how to bake cupcakes.
[52:52] and you know how to do those things and
[52:54] you can teach someone how to do it, but
[52:56] when you haven't experienced it, I I
[52:58] couldn't teach someone how to make
[52:59] cupcakes cuz I've never done it. That's
[53:00] right, brother. Man,
[53:02] I can make some French toast.
[53:04] Yeah,
[53:05] I made that. I learned that in home
[53:06] economics in in sixth grade,
[53:11] but I I can teach you how to make French
[53:13] toast. I could teach you how to make
[53:14] some scrambled eggs and boil some water.
[53:17] And I could teach you I could teach you
[53:19] how to uh I could do multiple things. in
[53:22] in the crock pot, too.
[53:25] Let the crock pot do all the cooking.
[53:27] That's right.
[53:28] I could chop some stuff and put it in
[53:30] there.
[53:31] But see, I could teach you that cuz I've
[53:33] experienced it. Right.
[53:34] But you you can't when you haven't
[53:36] experienced it.
[53:38] And and and so, you know, I talking to
[53:41] young people, but it's for all of us.
[53:43] Amen. You can't really explain to people
[53:45] out here what it is to be born again if
[53:48] you really haven't been born again.
[53:49] Amen.
[53:51] What it is to have an experience with
[53:53] God and and met the Savior for myself
[53:56] and and have an experience with the word
[53:58] of God and a revelation in my life
[54:00] when you really don't have that
[54:02] revelation.
[54:02] Right, brother? Man,
[54:04] it's it's tough.
[54:05] Yep.
[54:06] But that's what God is calling us to.
[54:08] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[54:11] Right, brother?
[54:13] So God is going to manifest himself in
[54:17] flesh in this hour s. Amen. Amen.
[54:20] Amen. Through the son of man. Amen. The
[54:22] son of man will manifest himself once
[54:25] again.
[54:26] And I believe he's doing it even now.
[54:27] Amen.
[54:28] Amen. The ministry of the son of man. He
[54:31] He's going to have witnesses in this
[54:32] hour.
[54:33] He will. Amen.
[54:33] He's going to have witnesses that know
[54:35] what they're talking about.
[54:37] Because they have experienced the
[54:38] revelation of Jesus Christ for
[54:40] themselves.
[54:41] Amen.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:42] That's right, brother.
[54:43] But Brandon says here in the in the in
[54:45] Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And
[54:47] we're almost through now. In these last
[54:48] days, he has promised to manifest
[54:50] himself in the fullness again. What? In
[54:53] the fullness,
[54:54] Amen.
[54:54] of his flesh in spirit. See, for as it
[54:58] was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be
[55:01] in the coming of the Son of Man.
[55:03] And upon earth today, I'm just kind of
[55:05] skipping around, but he says, "And upon
[55:07] earth today, he has manifested himself
[55:10] in the human bodies."
[55:12] Amen. Do you believe that?
[55:14] Amen. our human bodies that he has
[55:17] called and done exactly the same thing
[55:21] he done in sundried times and in and in
[55:24] the times of his flesh upon the earth.
[55:26] Yep.
[55:27] Right.
[55:28] And doing the same thing today because
[55:31] God in sundried times spoke to the
[55:33] fathers through the prophets in this
[55:35] last days through his son Jesus Christ.
[55:37] See the sun being revealed in the last
[55:40] days. God manifested in human flesh
[55:43] setting just before Sodom's destruction
[55:46] the end of the gentile world. You see it
[55:48] there? There's three manifestations.
[55:50] Amen.
[55:50] Right.
[55:51] So God in this hour, Amen. He's going to
[55:53] manifest himself again through the
[55:55] ministry of the son of man. Amen.
[55:57] Amen.
[55:57] He can't he he can't do anything without
[56:00] your flesh.
[56:01] Amen.
[56:02] He needs you.
[56:03] Amen, brother.
[56:04] Praise God.
[56:05] He's done his part,
[56:07] right? Amen.
[56:08] But he saved a part for you and me to do
[56:10] in this hour.
[56:12] He did what he did to do. Now it's now
[56:15] you've got to do something about it.
[56:16] Amen.
[56:17] Because remember, let's just take it in
[56:19] the physical. My wife is my help me. I'm
[56:23] just using my wife this tonight.
[56:25] Andraise.
[56:26] All right.
[56:26] Because she is Oh my.
[56:29] Absolutely.
[56:29] She helped me multiple times coming to
[56:32] church today driving.
[56:34] Yeah.
[56:35] Do enough.
[56:36] Yeah.
[56:38] Louise.
[56:43] She's my helpmate.
[56:45] Helps me stay alive.
[56:47] [Laughter]
[56:51] That's right.
[56:52] But let's take let's let's take it for
[56:54] example. What was I going with that?
[56:57] Help me.
[56:58] Yeah. Help me.
[57:02] That she she she's my help me. I mean I
[57:04] can't I can't do it. I can't do it
[57:06] without without her. Amen,
[57:08] brother.
[57:09] And so Jesus is the same thing. He can't
[57:11] do it without your body. Praise God.
[57:13] Right.
[57:15] And we have to be in one accord.
[57:16] Amen.
[57:18] In order to get things taken care of,
[57:20] right, brother man.
[57:21] Praise the Lord. Now, I know that
[57:22] doesn't happen all the time, but um but
[57:26] for the most part, we're in one accord.
[57:28] Amen. To run things around the house.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:31] And same thing with the word. Amen. You
[57:33] can't perform the word of God if you're
[57:35] not in agreement with the word.
[57:37] Amen. Amen.
[57:39] You if you don't see it in the word and
[57:41] and you I just can't really do that
[57:43] because I don't it's not been revealed
[57:46] to me. Then you won't do it.
[57:47] Right.
[57:48] And there'll be a problem.
[57:49] Yep.
[57:50] You see,
[57:51] right?
[57:51] Just like re the baptism in the name of
[57:54] Lord Jesus Christ. I can't do that
[57:55] because I just don't see it.
[57:58] But if you really want to see it, you
[58:00] ask God to show you.
[58:01] Amen.
[58:02] Amen. That's right.
[58:03] Lord, if I'm missing something, you help
[58:04] me.
[58:06] I want to be right.
[58:06] Amen. Amen.
[58:08] I want to be right.
[58:09] Amen.
[58:10] And I believe with that attitude, God
[58:11] shows us what's right. He will
[58:13] because he promised that he would lead
[58:15] us and guide us onto all truth.
[58:17] Amen.
[58:18] But he's not going to force you onto all
[58:20] truth.
[58:21] He's not going to push you unto all
[58:23] truth.
[58:23] He you have to be willing to want to all
[58:26] truth.
[58:27] Praise God.
[58:28] Amen.
[58:29] So, it's a willingness there that that
[58:31] we need to have as well. That's it.
[58:32] So things can't run. Amen. According in
[58:35] in our home properly or I can't walk,
[58:37] how can two walk together unless it be
[58:39] agreed?
[58:40] Jesus said
[58:42] you can't do it.
[58:43] So when you don't have that that that
[58:45] that
[58:47] relationship with the word then you
[58:49] can't you can't manifest the word the
[58:52] way it should. Praise God. These are
[58:54] basic things. We all know this. Amen.
[58:57] Now, the next thing happens is when it's
[58:59] all gathered up unto that one person,
[59:01] Jesus Christ, bride and body, at the
[59:04] physical return of the Lord Jesus,
[59:06] making his three times when he was
[59:08] brought on earth, killed, crucified,
[59:10] raised up, manifesting himself in the
[59:12] form of his body, which is his bride,
[59:15] the woman. You get it? She is part of
[59:17] his body.
[59:18] Yes. And the bride today is taken out
[59:20] from the body of Christ which is acting
[59:22] and doing just exactly like he said it
[59:25] would do uh for this day.
[59:28] The bride, the queen, king and the
[59:32] queen. Brother Brandon says,
[59:33] "Amen."
[59:35] So there's the joint heir and heir and
[59:37] joint heir. Amen.
[59:39] Queen has just as much right as the king
[59:41] does.
[59:43] Just as much power. Praise God.
[59:46] Praise the Lord Jesus. So, let's go back
[59:49] to Revelations chapter 1 and we're we're
[59:51] finishing off here. Amen. The revelation
[59:53] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him.
[59:56] Amen. So, Jesus Christ had to come to
[59:59] this as well,
[1:00:00] right? Amen.
[1:00:01] Praise God.
[1:00:02] Yep.
[1:00:02] Now, you think about it, saints. You
[1:00:04] think about think about this. Him being
[1:00:06] a human and in the garden of Gethsemane,
[1:00:10] he didn't want to die.
[1:00:12] He he he didn't he didn't want to go
[1:00:14] through what he knew he had to do
[1:00:16] right
[1:00:17] humanly speaking
[1:00:19] because out of his mouth amen he he
[1:00:22] expressed Lord take this cup away from
[1:00:24] me
[1:00:25] I in other words I don't want to go
[1:00:27] through this
[1:00:28] and neither one of us want to go through
[1:00:30] the hardships of of Christianity
[1:00:33] if we really knew what it was to be a
[1:00:35] Christian
[1:00:36] right
[1:00:37] you know in churches out here they'll
[1:00:39] tell you oh Christianity is It's
[1:00:41] wonderful when you come to the Lord
[1:00:43] Jesus. Oh, your you know, like brother
[1:00:46] Wayade says, all your bills will get
[1:00:48] paid and your dog will never pee in your
[1:00:50] house and and uh you know, and you'll
[1:00:53] always have money in the bank and and uh
[1:00:56] you know, and you'll all you know.
[1:00:58] Come on, brother. That's right.
[1:01:00] Oh, Christianity is awesome that way.
[1:01:02] Yeah.
[1:01:04] You know,
[1:01:06] cuz you have a dog. All right.
[1:01:10] Christianity is fun that way. Amen. But
[1:01:13] you see, Jesus went through the same
[1:01:15] thing kind of like us,
[1:01:16] right?
[1:01:17] He was battling his own self, too.
[1:01:20] Cuz he didn't want to die.
[1:01:22] He He didn't want to He didn't want to I
[1:01:24] can imagine maybe he knew what kind of
[1:01:26] death he was to suffer.
[1:01:28] He saw it.
[1:01:30] And so And so he he he imagine yourself
[1:01:34] knowing how you're going to die.
[1:01:36] Yeah.
[1:01:37] But yet Amen.
[1:01:38] You have to go do it.
[1:01:40] Because you have a people depending upon
[1:01:43] you.
[1:01:43] Amen.
[1:01:44] You have a people that is part of you
[1:01:46] that are going to obtain the same power
[1:01:48] that you are obtaining in that hour that
[1:01:51] are are going to be overcomers just as
[1:01:53] you are overcome just as Jesus was
[1:01:55] overcoming in that hour.
[1:01:56] Right. Amen.
[1:01:57] Right.
[1:01:58] And I bet you that was just pulling him.
[1:02:00] Right. Amen.
[1:02:01] Amen.
[1:02:02] So when he died, he died. Amen. He was
[1:02:04] thinking of you.
[1:02:05] Amen.
[1:02:06] Amen.
[1:02:06] The whole time. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:02:09] He said, "I'd do that." I'm He wasn't
[1:02:10] doing it for himself.
[1:02:13] Abraham said that he could have called a
[1:02:15] legion of thousands of angels to come
[1:02:18] rescue him, and he never did.
[1:02:20] He had the power to do so.
[1:02:23] But the whole time he had brother Don in
[1:02:25] mind.
[1:02:26] Amen.
[1:02:26] Sister Susan in mind.
[1:02:28] Amen. Each and every one of you in mind.
[1:02:30] Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:31] Thinking, I know they need this.
[1:02:33] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:02:34] They need me to go through this. I don't
[1:02:37] want to do this, but I've got to do
[1:02:38] this.
[1:02:40] Yep.
[1:02:40] And you know, when you come to a point,
[1:02:42] Amen, where you're forgetting more about
[1:02:44] yourself, where the world now today is
[1:02:46] more thinking about themselves, right?
[1:02:49] It's more about me, me, me, me, me.
[1:02:50] Jesus at towards the end was thinking
[1:02:53] less of himself.
[1:02:54] Amen.
[1:02:55] And so much that the world said, the
[1:02:57] Bible says that for God so loved the
[1:03:01] world
[1:03:02] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:03:05] and the Bible says that he died for
[1:03:07] many.
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:09] Now, he died for the whole world. We
[1:03:11] know. We know that. But we know the
[1:03:12] whole world wouldn't receive him.
[1:03:14] That's why the Bible words it that way.
[1:03:16] He died for many.
[1:03:19] I'm glad I'm part of that many.
[1:03:21] Amen.
[1:03:21] Thank God.
[1:03:22] Amen. I I I can say you and I, amen, are
[1:03:25] part of that many. Amen. That Lord
[1:03:27] Jesus, I couldn't do it without you,
[1:03:29] Lord.
[1:03:29] Amen.
[1:03:30] Thank God.
[1:03:31] True.
[1:03:32] Amen. So, the actual revelation of Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ has been in the word all this
[1:03:38] time
[1:03:40] and given unto us. Yet, we still didn't
[1:03:44] have the revelation of it for ourselves.
[1:03:47] I mean, the the the word has always been
[1:03:49] there.
[1:03:50] Right.
[1:03:51] Amen. You just needed to shine light
[1:03:52] upon it.
[1:03:53] Praise God. Many, many, many people have
[1:03:56] read this Bible from front and back
[1:03:58] many, many times in their life and never
[1:04:02] saw the things that we see today.
[1:04:04] Right, brother? Amen.
[1:04:06] Because it wasn't time yet.
[1:04:08] Didn't decian decianize them. Amen.
[1:04:11] Y
[1:04:11] but it wasn't time. Amen. God had to
[1:04:13] shine light upon the word in this day in
[1:04:16] a in a certain way. Amen. that the words

[1:04:20] they're popping up now in our in our in

[1:04:25] Cuz God's going to have a bride.

[1:04:28] And not a bride manifesting his word.
[1:04:31] Amen.
[1:04:32] Amen. A living a living word bride.

[1:04:35] Praise God.

[1:06:06] little book out of the angel's hand and
[1:06:08] ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:06:10] as honey.
[1:06:11] And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly

[1:07:45] quote. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:07:47] revealed. Let's have the musicians come.
[1:07:49] Let's stand to our feet. His body will
[1:07:52] do the works that he promised like in
[1:07:54] Mark 16 and so forth.
[1:07:56] His body was not held in the grave, but
[1:08:00] was recognized with him in the
[1:08:02] resurrection.
[1:08:03] Do you get it? Then the body of his
[1:08:07] believing children will not be held in
[1:08:09] the grave.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:11] When he comes, but will be recognized
[1:08:13] with him.
[1:08:14] Amen. because he died for the purpose to
[1:08:17] resurrect his bride.
[1:08:18] Amen.

[1:08:19] Yep.
[1:08:19] Amen.
[1:08:21] Recognized. Because it is his body.
[1:08:24] Because
[1:08:25] it's the word.
[1:08:27] Remember, wherever the head goes, that's
[1:08:30] where the body goes.
[1:08:31] Amen.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:33] Right.
[1:08:34] His word which he is has has be to be
[1:08:38] risen.
[1:08:40] Man, the word that down through the age
[1:08:42] of Luther Wesley see has began to raise
[1:08:44] up to its power. There it began to move.
[1:08:49] Then it moved a little more. Now it's
[1:08:51] coming up to ident an identification.
[1:08:54] You see it's moving up and it's becoming
[1:08:56] to an identification. Amen.
[1:08:59] Praise God. Now to the life in the body
[1:09:02] is a vindication of the rapture is at
[1:09:05] hand. When you see the headship and the
[1:09:08] body becoming one,
[1:09:09] right?
[1:09:10] And the fullness of the measure of his
[1:09:12] manifestation shows that the body is
[1:09:15] about to is about ready to be received
[1:09:19] to the headship. Amen.
[1:09:21] And I have I don't know if they have the
[1:09:22] picture up, but of the stature of the
[1:09:24] perfect man. I love that picture. I
[1:09:26] don't know if they could blow it up a
[1:09:28] little more,
[1:09:28] but
[1:09:30] that is what the statue of a perfect man
[1:09:32] should be.
[1:09:34] Amen. And that is what your life, Amen,
[1:09:36] little by little, is manifesting. And
[1:09:38] it's got to come to a head.
[1:09:40] Amen.
[1:09:41] And that head should should come back to
[1:09:43] what was first given to you at faith.
[1:09:45] Right. Amen.
[1:09:47] It's Jesus Christ at the foundation.
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ is the head.
[1:09:51] The whole thing is Jesus Christ.
[1:09:53] So it's Christ manifesting through your
[1:09:55] life. Amen.
[1:09:56] Amen.
[1:09:56] Praise the Lord. So it's the revelation
[1:09:58] of Jesus Christ reveals who you are
[1:10:02] and this is what it's supposed to
[1:10:03] produce.
[1:10:03] Absolutely. Amen.
[1:10:04] It's supposed to produce him.
[1:10:06] Not supposed to produce you.
[1:10:09] It's supposed to produce him.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:11] Oh, it feels good. I know it's Oh, thank
[1:10:14] God for the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:15] It reveals who my position and and what
[1:10:18] I can do. No, but it goes back to what
[1:10:20] he is.
[1:10:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:22] So, yes, it it re it reveals who you
[1:10:25] are,
[1:10:26] but what your purpose is in the body,
[1:10:28] right? Amen. Because remember, we don't
[1:10:31] do nothing without the head saying so
[1:10:33] first.
[1:10:33] Amen.
[1:10:34] And the head is the word.
[1:10:35] Amen.
[1:10:36] Then my arm moves,
[1:10:38] right?
[1:10:38] Cuz my head said so.
[1:10:40] Right. Then my my finger is wiggling
[1:10:43] because my brain is telling it to move.
[1:10:46] It's all coming from here.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:48] And that's the same thing with you and I
[1:10:50] saints. You don't move unless the word
[1:10:51] says so.
[1:10:52] Sometimes we we're we're we get in
[1:10:54] trouble and you see it throughout your
[1:10:57] lives. Those have been in the in in this
[1:11:00] walk for for a long time. Men have
[1:11:03] gotten in trouble because they move
[1:11:05] ahead try to move ahead of God.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:09] You know, when you when you try to move
[1:11:13] ahead of the plan of God, you end up
[1:11:15] getting in trouble.
[1:11:16] And where are those men now?
[1:11:19] You don't hear much about them anymore.
[1:11:22] I'm not decianizing them. I believe that
[1:11:24] they wanted to go to heaven just like
[1:11:25] you do.
[1:11:28] But their doctrines and the things that
[1:11:31] they tried to accumulate on their own,
[1:11:33] it never amounted to anything. And it
[1:11:35] never perfected a bride.
[1:11:38] Cuz we are still here.
[1:11:40] There's many people still desiring more
[1:11:42] of the word. So if what they had was so
[1:11:45] wonderful and why is people still
[1:11:46] wanting more?
[1:11:47] Yeah.
[1:11:48] Because that wasn't it. Again,
[1:11:51] it takes the mundane
[1:11:54] daily routine
[1:11:55] of living out this word and growing in
[1:11:58] that stature. Yeah, you're going to
[1:11:59] fall.
[1:12:00] Yeah, you're going to make mistakes.
[1:12:01] You're going to take two steps forward
[1:12:03] and then one step back. That's okay.
[1:12:06] Repent. Get up. A true soldier gets up,
[1:12:09] repents, and keeps moving forward.
[1:12:11] He doesn't stay there on the on the
[1:12:13] ground walling around because the
[1:12:14] captain, Amen, is coming out. Get up,
[1:12:17] boy. Yeah. Right.
[1:12:18] You're a soldier.
[1:12:19] That's right, brother.
[1:12:20] You're in You're in the army of the
[1:12:21] Lord.
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:23] You're supposed to be fighting.
[1:12:24] Amen.
[1:12:25] No.
[1:12:26] I failed. Get up, boy.
[1:12:29] That's right.
[1:12:30] He ain't going to have He ain't going to
[1:12:31] have it.
[1:12:32] Right. His word won't have it.
[1:12:34] That's right. Amen.
[1:12:35] So, no excuses in this hour. Amen.
[1:12:37] I've got a heaven to go to.
[1:12:39] I hope you come with me.
[1:12:41] Amen.
[1:12:41] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's sing
[1:12:43] something, Brother John.
[1:12:48] ugly
[1:12:50] heart. You need a prayer, more than glad
[1:12:53] to pray with you, God,
[1:12:58] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:13:07] Create in me a clean heart.
[1:13:15] Oh God. Oh help us Lord and renew a
[1:13:21] right spirit within me.
[1:13:28] Oh

[1:13:33] from thy presence.
[1:13:37] Oh Lord,
[1:13:41] take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[1:13:49] Restore
[1:13:52] unto me
[1:13:56] the joy of thy salvation
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:02] and renew a right spirit within me. Oh,
[1:14:07] sing it unto him one more time.
[1:14:11] Create in me a king.
[1:14:16] Oh, is that your heart's desire?
[1:14:18] Oh Lord, renew a right spirit with me
[1:14:23] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:14:29] God bless you. Thanks.
[1:14:32] Create in me a clean heart.
[1:14:40] Oh God, God
[1:14:44] and renew your right spirit within me.
[1:14:52] Oh, oh, cast me not away. You know, if
[1:14:57] you ask him that, he can't cast you
[1:15:00] away.
[1:15:01] He'll bring you right into his presence.
[1:15:05] Take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] Restore
[1:15:16] unto me
[1:15:19] the joy of thy salvation.
[1:15:25] And renew arise spirit within me.
[1:15:33] Let's give our brother a good hand. That
[1:15:34] was wonderful. Good job.
[1:15:38] I tell you, it just gets goodter and
[1:15:40] goodter. It may be bitter to have to
[1:15:41] live it, but it it is sweet as honey.
[1:15:44] Amen.
[1:15:45] It did taste sweet.
[1:15:46] So, there's a sweetness there somewhere.
[1:15:49] We just got to find it.
[1:15:50] Amen.
[1:15:50] And when we live it out, it just become,
[1:15:53] as the song says, sweeter as a day goes
[1:15:55] by.
[1:15:56] Now, can you say that?
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:15:58] Sweeter
[1:16:00] than you started. Amen.
[1:16:01] Yes.
[1:16:02] Cuz we're one day home. Closer to home.
[1:16:06] We're one day from the body change.
[1:16:08] We're one day when there's a time when
[1:16:11] all this will be over.
[1:16:13] Won't have to worry about it. You won't
[1:16:15] have to uh won't have to worry about
[1:16:17] heartaches and troubles and trials.
[1:16:19] It'll all be over.
[1:16:20] Amen.
[1:16:20] So, just keep persevering. Just keep
[1:16:22] going. Keep keep pushing. I like what
[1:16:24] brother Louie said. You know, you you
[1:16:26] you you think of all the uh two or three
[1:16:29] million people that were walking around
[1:16:30] Jericho and yeah, there was some in cuz
[1:16:32] remember there was a mixed multitude.
[1:16:34] They were some grumblers in there and
[1:16:36] every congre I'm sorry, never mind.
[1:16:40] And every congregation you got different
[1:16:42] people. Okay? So there was grumblers in
[1:16:45] the crowd and there was like Louise says
[1:16:47] like, "Hey man, come on. This is got a
[1:16:49] little mundane."
[1:16:51] But if Joshua, which was a type of the
[1:16:54] Holy Ghost,
[1:16:56] they did what he said,
[1:16:59] right?
[1:16:59] And they saw the fruit of that labor.
[1:17:04] They didn't just walk and then just
[1:17:05] nothing happened. No, they was walking
[1:17:07] towards something. And and maybe some of
[1:17:09] them got converted after the after the
[1:17:11] seventh day and they went seven times
[1:17:13] around and I bet they were really tired.
[1:17:16] Yeah.
[1:17:16] But like Louise said, they went to
[1:17:18] church on Wednesday, Sunday, Wednesday,
[1:17:21] and Sunday. Wednesday and Sunday. Read
[1:17:25] your Bible and study and pray. Read your
[1:17:27] Bible. Study and pray. They got
[1:17:30] something. They got what they went there
[1:17:32] for. You know what? And they got an
[1:17:34] impossibility.
[1:17:36] It was impossible. They could have not.
[1:17:38] There was no dynamite at the time. There
[1:17:39] was no bulldozers. There was no um uh
[1:17:43] RPGs to knock that wall down. It was so
[1:17:45] thick they could run chariot races
[1:17:46] around it. And people actually lived on
[1:17:48] the wall.
[1:17:50] But those people did exactly what Joshua
[1:17:52] said.
[1:17:52] Yeah.
[1:17:53] The Lord spoke to Joshua and said, "Hey,
[1:17:55] all right. Now, don't everybody get your
[1:17:58] shovel." No, he didn't say that. He
[1:18:00] said, "On that seventh day, you shout."
[1:18:04] A voice.
[1:18:06] a voice came up
[1:18:08] and I bet those people were like, "Man,
[1:18:11] they're rebelling. They're just they're
[1:18:12] they're tired of it now. They're just
[1:18:14] screaming." And then all of a sudden,
[1:18:16] the wall started crumbling.
[1:18:20] The ground opened up, sucked that thing
[1:18:22] into the ground, and the children of
[1:18:24] Israel didn't even have to climb over
[1:18:25] the rubble. They just walked straight
[1:18:26] over the top of that thing
[1:18:28] and took over. And that's what we're
[1:18:30] doing. We're we're going around and
[1:18:32] around that wall of Jericho. And
[1:18:35] remember, they never rebuilt Jericho
[1:18:36] back. There's a place there, but they
[1:18:39] never built that wall back. Why? Because
[1:18:40] when God knocks the wall down,
[1:18:43] it's done. It's finished. So, just just
[1:18:46] pray for Brother Luis. That was a good
[1:18:47] job today. Good job tonight. Uh
[1:18:49] remember, prayer service on Saturday
[1:18:51] night at 7:00 and then we'll have
[1:18:53] regular services on Sunday. But if you
[1:18:55] if some of you that I know a lot of you
[1:18:56] not going to be here, but for those of
[1:18:58] you that are going to be here for our
[1:18:59] meeting in July,
[1:19:02] um if they'll pull it up on the screen,
[1:19:04] we're going to have uh it's going to be
[1:19:06] a catered meal and we'll pay for it. But
[1:19:08] what's they're going to do is they're
[1:19:10] going to set up outside in a um a
[1:19:13] trailer with the food. Now, what you got
[1:19:15] to do is is you've got to I don't know
[1:19:20] if you can read that or not, but this is
[1:19:22] every person that's going to be here.
[1:19:24] that Sunday. Every person
[1:19:28] um little
[1:19:30] Maya, you too.
[1:19:32] Every child, every individual that's
[1:19:35] going to eat with us that day has to
[1:19:38] fill one of these out. All right,
[1:19:41] everybody with me? All right. Going to
[1:19:43] have hamburgers, cheeseburgers, bacon
[1:19:44] burgers, and that's an example. Whatever
[1:19:46] you get, circle it. Circle all the
[1:19:49] condiments. Or you can have chicken
[1:19:51] strips, but you can only have one. You
[1:19:54] can't have three hot dogs or three
[1:19:56] hamburgers or hamburgers and chicken
[1:19:58] tenders. No, you either want a hot dog,
[1:20:00] you either want a cheeseburger, bacon
[1:20:02] cheeseburger, mushroom, Swiss, or a hot
[1:20:04] dog. But you can have all those toppings
[1:20:06] you want. And then you can have fries,
[1:20:10] cheese fries, or chili cheese fries. I
[1:20:13] know some of you can't read that, but
[1:20:15] you've been given your sheet as you
[1:20:17] walked in the door. So, if you're going
[1:20:18] to be here to get something to eat and
[1:20:21] you're going to have to put your name
[1:20:22] down, don't put don't put um a direct
[1:20:28] family. It's got to be John, Alicia, and
[1:20:32] girls, and then if Lil John comes too.
[1:20:34] So, anyway, every person, if you don't,
[1:20:36] you won't get an order cuz they're
[1:20:37] they're pre-making the orders. And it's
[1:20:40] something that we're trying and they
[1:20:41] they did a real good job on another time
[1:20:43] for us. So, we're going to let them uh
[1:20:45] well, actually, they did the banquet,
[1:20:47] the Valentine's banquet, and did a real
[1:20:49] good job with that. So, we're going to
[1:20:50] This is July the 4th. Hamburgers,
[1:20:52] cheeseburgers. We ain't eating steak.
[1:20:54] We're going to have hamburgers,
[1:20:55] cheeseburgers. The church will supply
[1:20:57] the bottle water. So, don't worry about
[1:20:59] circling that. If you want any of those
[1:21:01] other ones, though, sweet tea, unsweet
[1:21:02] tea, Coke, Coke, Zero, Sprite, bottle
[1:21:05] water will be for the church will be
[1:21:07] providing that. Also, the church will be
[1:21:09] providing the dessert. All right? So you
[1:21:11] won't have to worry about the dessert.
[1:21:13] But hamburgers, cheeseburgers, whichever
[1:21:16] one you want, circle them and then turn
[1:21:18] them in by next Wednesday cuz this
[1:21:22] thing's coming up in a few weeks. By
[1:21:24] next Wednesday. So we need them a week
[1:21:27] from tonight. So you got this coming
[1:21:28] weekend. We'll announce it this weekend.
[1:21:30] And then you've got Wednesday night to
[1:21:33] turn these in. Make sure you put your
[1:21:35] name down. All right. Family Roberts
[1:21:38] name Richard. All right. So that's his
[1:21:42] that's what Richard's having. So y'all
[1:21:43] know what Richard's gonna have, I guess,
[1:21:46] or un unless that's an example. But just
[1:21:49] remember the prayer service on Saturday
