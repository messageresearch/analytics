the computer rich you're trying to figure out a place to put everybody maybe what if we do like the Opera doesn't we knock the ceiling out and we'll go up to the second level yeah you know it's a good problem to have when we first started going to church here it was hard to find one person to play to even hum I saw much less play much less have to look for a place to put everybody we had a on the old building those of you that were never here but then the door was here two windows were here the pulpit was here seats went this way and the wall was right where brother Larry's that thought about where those flowers are and there was one piano right there and that was it that was it nothing else that was all we just had a had a player had a PN and a few people to play it Joyce was young she played it and then several others didn't come true but thank God we got a we got to find a place to put everybody now and we got a lot of talent sitting back there that could be up here playing so maybe the Lord will work on you not right now though because we got to find places for these first so good to be in the house of the Lord you love the Lord amen so let's get started in the sixth seal part two we're still on the seal which we must see what the seal is I believe the Prophet you know he'd probably read there and preached on the seals for a long time and like we were talking about last night he there's a lot of things he preached but remember what we've been saying brother branham in every seal he had a certain idea and then that idea was changed right but now brother Ram didn't say all right now throw all them other 47 to 63 like a lot of people saying the message you know he was so wrong no he didn't have to change all that he just was lining it up more a more perfect way of seeing one gun water baptism marriage in divorce all those things are already in the scripture but it took clarity of their opening of the seals that's why the Bible became a brand-new book because I'm sure there were some things in there that the Prophet had questions about like we have questions about things but when the seals broke I believe the clarity of the message came out from those seals to not change the book heavenly days no didn't change the book and it just gave him more clarity of what he was preaching on and he he knew what he was talking about he said we unless God comes and open these seals were only presuming we'll see we're only presuming until the seals break - you and I amen so we're only presuming and presuming does not get you in the body change no it's got to be a positive everything's got to be positive coming to this body change and then this sixth seal we're looking at then now that we've been looking in the first four seals where there was a bride come there was a an old man died but then you've still got the black dog white dog fight that you got to still fight with which is your spirit realm or your your outside guy not this guy but the middle guy that you got fight with the fight shouldn't be with the inside if the fight still with the inside guy then you need to get born again but if that's settled then let's work on the outside guy we're talking about this morning in the Bible stemming in Sunday school class about milks good but when you're 25 years old you know you don't want to just live on milk you need some meat you need something but now if you've only been given it shut up in a if you've been shut up in a room for 25 years and all they've dunnage somebody hand you milk through a window then that's okay it's a stained you but man it will stunt your growth that's for sure but you ever slide him I tell him what we're dantos and him I'll give him a rib eye State Daniel I swear by my mother to give him a ribeye steak medium-rare with baked potatoes Natalie can't see what he'll do with it he'll take that milk and he'll just move it out of the way and he'll just start eating what eating meat and so that's what we were talking about Paul in Romans therefore he said don't you know don't shun the guy that likes to drink milk in other words paraphrasing but don't stay drinking milk all the time though he looks good but we need some strong meat strong meats what's going to get us out of here so this sixth seal this would be six sealed part two the seal part two so let's go to revelation 6 verse 12 I think brother Lewis for filling in brother Joe and his family are done it at brother Yancy's with brother Matthew break it speaking for them down there so they're on their way back so keep them in your prayers also keep meaning the prayers me and your prayers I finally got I guess I can say this over the Internet I've got a postmaster now that'll let me off so I'm gonna go to the Philippines Lord willing March the 7th through the 19th so and and then I got it takes just a few minutes to go from Keith Reed he wants me there on the 6th in Jamaica so we got to work on that so you just pray we got to pray about that so all right I don't know how that's gonna happen but I don't think it's gonna happen but we'll see what we can do so I'll have to call him back later on this afternoon revelation 6 verse 12 let's bow our heads thank you Lord for another day another time that we can come into this building Lord and just shed off the things of the world just for a few moments Lord and sit back and hear from you Lord not that it's hearing from me Lord they'll be hearing from you father and Lord all things that we've learned all in all these years of studying the Bible and studying the message Lord may they come alive may it not be a dead letter but Lord let it be quickened by the spirit Lord these words are just common words that we use is man and we understand them as human beings and as Americans we speak in English language but Lord your language of the heavenly language it uses that language but Lord is a heavenly language just as you told us through the Prophet that we are prophetic people with prophetic insight that we can hear from you Lord in this time of of the Eagle Age where we've come up now where we're into this sixth seal we're heading toward the seventh seal Lord we're gonna take a little interval before we do but Lord you promised that we would someone stand in the end time and take a body change so we just believe that it's us we just believe that you are here with us among us not just with us but in us and lord I pray that our actions and our movements and know everything that we say today Lord will be pleasing to You Father let it be you speaking and there's no way we can make a mistake if it's you father we were the ones that are sick Lord the ones that are not here be with the ones that are traveling on the highways just bless them Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign fields getting the fruit for their labor father and be with us now as we've had the call there to go to the Philippines Lord that you would that you would grant Lord in our heart we have a desire and you know what that desire is is to help people Lord to grow in grace and knowledge father so we pray that you would anoint that as we take our time to go Lord and let it just be in your will father lets us take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit and the bride of Jesus Christ says amen revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened the sick cela now this is John watching something open now remember he watched seal 1 through 4 there was writers there was John saw a person get on a horse and now they're gone there's no beast he gets to the fifth seal they're in another dimension that's a group of people that's passed on and they're in they're not on earth they're in another dimension and then here though watch what we're going to do is though we're going to come out of that fifth seal going into the sixth seal we're coming right back to earth we're coming right back into this dimension and what's going to happen on this earth at the time of this opening now remember you and I are not going to be here but you and I must get the spiritual application of what's going on like we were talking in the Bible study and I got it in one of the quotes where we talk about brother Branham says that we the bride goes up in Revelations for one doesn't come back to revelations 19 there's got to be a revelation there you might as well just take four through 1910 the Bible to tear that out of the Bible throw in the trash but you can't because every word is to the bride of Jesus Christ every word is what for your and my admonition to whom the ends of the world become upon so we can't do away with it so then we must understand that it is to a literal person a literal group called Israel but it's also spiritually to you and I so that's what we need to get we're gonna get the seal part first then we're going to get the spiritual application to you and I all right and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake so now that's something gonna happen down here on the earth and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth let me say something about the moon turned to blood you know we've had two blood moons and all these things that's okay I'm like Paul we were talking there in Revelations this month I mean in Romans this morning we're policy you know don't in other words don't criticize the people that keep up with dates but I'm just not a date keepers what he was saying basically so same way with me I you know this moon is not a moon we're gonna see now we've seen moons we've seen all these things we've the the Sun went down the middle of day when Jesus died and then we've had black black of the Sun in our day through eclipses that's not what this is this is in the tribulation period this is when we are gone and nature is going to fall because of something we'll talk about a little bit later on but the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind you know there's always that conspiracy theory that there's that's what happened to the flood there was a meteorite hit the earth and caused a flood and now they're saying there's another one that's going to get close and all those things don't worry about that see that takes the worry out of me and you you and I should should not worry about this natural happening if you see this you better worry about it but if you're a bride you won't see this Amen we'll be right over in another faster dimension and let it happen that's okay but you and I as bride are already gone that ought to make you happy amen and the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together Wow and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne they know this is not just a natural occurrence of the earth something is going on and we know what it is we know it's the two prophets over in Israel working this sixth seal from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word while we put this somebody turn around shake each other's hand say God bless you cuz I got to work to do just me and Danny's got work to do here if you're already done it do it again give up give up a double blessing just turn on shake hands again say god bless you you know brother branham said that's the greatest thing you can say to somebody is God bless you amen now as we start on this let's set the stage and then we'll well let's go ahead and read Matthew 24 we're go and pull that up we'll get that now this is the actual Jesus preaching on the seals see now look it says immediately after the tribulation after the tribulation of these days now we're going to talk about that in just a minute because remember we were talking last night in a Bible study and for those of you who weren't there you should have been there because we had a good time usually if you'll come on Saturday you can sleep through Sunday because that's what we're talking about but y'all don't come on Sunday and you sleep - I mean Saturday you can sleep through Sunday anyway some but tribulation we must look at tribulation and not see that it's the tribulation is going to happen after the bride leaves because you and I are going through a tribulation now I've got it here where it says right here well that I'll just read it the word tribulation means affliction pressure and anguish and a lot of things that we are going through now that we go through tribulation because the Bible says tribulation worketh patience so we're going through tribulation now even even brother Branham calls Israel I read it in the fifth seal that when Israel went through the Aikman and Hitler days of the 6.5 million Jews killed that was a minor tribulation so there's been minor tribulations all through all through Christian realm there's been minor tribulations or minor afflictions our minor pressure our anguish so but we know there's a Great Tribulation now this sixth seal is talking about the great the tribulation the wrath of God after you and I leave okay so you have to like we were talking about this morning in Sunday School class you know there's there's resurrection there there's a different kinds of resurrection you can resurrect and somebody died you can resurrect and go into an eternal body I mean a glorified body so you got to watch what you're doing when you talk about these different words basically in the English language when we have so many that mean the same thing so this says in Matthew 24 immediately after the tribulation of those days no see your mind sometimes will go well that's after the tribulation no after the tribulation of these days everybody got that same in the tribulation of these days I'm talking about the days you and I are living in tribulation of those 2000 years those days a thousand years a day two thousand years shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven the power 11 shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory coz see like what we're talking about last night the denominational pretty much all of it not of your now I say denominational world Methodist Baptist I don't know about Presbyterian maybe though they can tell but I know Baptists and Methodists we're going to a seven-year tribulation I don't know about Presbyterian I don't know if they believe that too but most of your major what I say Methodist Baptist know they believe you're gonna go through a tribulation period because of all these different things and then they're gonna see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven that's why I told you that brother come one time he told me he said I'll be glad when I see the eastern sky split and Jesus come walking down through the eastern sky I said that's not a secret coming I start to come and I'm wanting if you see that you're in the Tribulation Period amen and then now the devil has got them so confused on the tribulation period that now they're believing you got to go through the tribulation we're brother Branham many times and you read it just put it in tribulation brother around many many many times he said brothers I know you're disagreeing with me because the whole like I said the whole denominational world believes and they seven-year tribulation and when brother Branham comes up and says the bride doesn't go through tribulation well that just blow their doctrine run out the water but you and I though seeing this we know that we can place that we go through minor tribulations ourselves but we never will go through a major three and a half year tribulation and that's what the problem with many people in the message that that doesn't see Daniel 70 weeks as as and I've quit saying the way we see it because it's not the way we see it its way the Bible says it is the way the Prophet says it is okay they're saying that we're saying we're going through a seven-year tribulation there's no such thing there's a three and a half year tribulation after we're gone not seven but it's going to take a full week or seven years to finish Daniel seventy weeks ever how God wants to play that last three and a half years out that's his business because we're going to be somewhere else amen but there is one week left after the rapture according to the Bible so I don't need a quote from anybody I'm gonna say that one more time I don't need a quote from anybody the Bible says there's one year left after signing of the treaty with the Antichrist and we are we here when that sign no so there's one week left after the rapture huh and that's you know that's what brother Brown said many many times they just don't understand what he's talking about and he shall send His angels with great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other all right so see we're all gone here's Jesus preaching the sixth seal so we know what's going to happen and then John picks it up in the book of Revelation and brings it to showing that it's the sixth seal and the sixth seal is gonna open after we leave all right so what we're doing now is is we're going through I want you to be able to see this because it ties in with what we've all been talking about the full plan of redemption that's what brother Branham says I'll read it to you in just a minute the quote where brother Branham talks about the sixth seal covers the whole plan of redemption that's everything everything is covered in these seals every part of redemption is covered in these seals Inchon of the bride redemption of the 144,000 redemption of the fifth seal Jew redemption of the foolish virgin they're all in there somewhere and even now we got to see the redemption of the earth because remember what happened in the Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden not only did man fall all of nature fell I would and I was looking up the quote when brother Lewis called me out where brother Brown talks about when Adam and Eve going out of the garden the lightning and the thundering sea before it's in happened there was no lightning there was no thunder there was no blackening of the earth of the of the Sun there was no Blood Moon there was no stars falling from the heavens everything was calm all nature was in course with each other then there was no I saw this I'm like dad I read the comic books to get the headlines today there was a comic strip with a little fish a bigger fish with his mouth open the bigger fish with its mouth open the bigger fish with this mouth open the little fish in the middle turn is turning around looking at the fish behind him you know the chain of and he says I want you to know I'm a carry permit holder so anyway but no there was no chain of eating or chain of command before the fall so Nature was exactly the way it's going to be when we get into the millennium and then even into the future home so nature took a tumble not just on the sixth seal nature took a tumble down in the Garden of Eden so the sixth seal we go all the way back to the Garden of Eden to where nature has just tumbled and fell while I mean now Adam has to be careful what part of the woods he walks in when he never did before why because his nature was changed because man had somewhere in man's part of his being had changed now not Adam soul but then the thinking is carnal mind you said well you don't have a carnal mind yeah you do got a carnal mind come on people good grief we do have we still have one but we have the mind of Christ in us that overcomes that every once in a while I said every once in a while alright but we're heading toward the time where it's overtaking more and more I hope we're in that that's the growth development of a Christian I believe is that we know we have a carnal mind but we know how to handle it because if brother Branham says we're going to be sticky till the day the change comes and we're going to have things going through our mind that's not the mind of Christ so just deal with it so I'm telling you just deal with it that's life deal with it all right just don't let it overcome you the things I used to do I don't do them anymore now if you're still doing the things you used to do you need to get morning in that's just pretty simple that's just probably one two three ABCs but for you and I to see that nature is not just that nature is taking a tumble or nature is it's boiling up one time it's already done it one time before I'm sure when Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden there was never thunder before there was never lightning before there had to be earthquakes they had to be things happened that didn't happen before because when man failed nature fell that's why Romans 8 says the whole world is groaning and waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God for us to bring nature back because if we fail and Nature has to fall under us then you and I have to come to a place to where we reverse that amen and we've already reversed that in our soul thank God for that people we've already reversed the process in our soul we're sitting in heavenly places we are the nature of God that has been changed but we still got this guy the dual fellow the next guy in the next realm that we got to work with and that's to me what the seals are for that and the Statue of a perfect man they all go hand in hand to work on what your nature your nature of my nature that's what we're sitting here today and I hope you realize that sometime in your life you need to have an experience to where you even say again that thing I used to do I don't do it anymore not sinning I'm talking about you put it you know make you make you whine and draw it and write in whatever you cuz I was telling them downstairs I've got something that bothers me that may don't even may be silly to brother mark but it bothers me so something I got to get rid of but mark may have something that bothers I mean just bothers him to no end I look at him and go come on nobody bothers in it that's the same - you and I are all individuals but you know what the word doesn't bother us it's out in this it's living in this natural nature that's what bothers us because it's all fell you were even born with a fallen nature you were born with a nature contrary to God we were by nature the scripture says the children of what wrath and ready to be destroyed because we came between Satan and Eve in their fallen condition but thank God he's swinging that thing back the other way that's what Redemption is it's not replacement it's if it fell here in the Garden of Eden it's got to come right back up to here amen so the fourth seal we see the bride's taken up so we know we've took a body change somewhere in here right all right there okay take a body change but now what we have to do during that time we must like we were saying before we got a lap back over because we don't get five six and actually none of the seals are to us the natural part of the seal but we must get the actual spiritual application of all of it to get us out of here and to get us out of here it's going to take all of them because who takes a rapture Christ takes the rapture right and he's the Seventh Seal he's coming back after himself he's not coming back after you he's coming back after a piece of him that he gave to you at the new birth he's coming back to get that that's what he's coming for and man he's coming for himself and see if I'm attached to that I got to go you got to go so he's gonna take a rapture he's gonna take a body change you got to make it personal now I'm not gonna make my self change God's you own the one that can change me but he's the one that's going in the rapture right I've accepted what he's gonna do and then I'm gonna just take I'm just gonna fish a free ride that's why why do we struggle you shouldn't struggle shouldn't have fear my brother Dale said you know you come to place brother I'm come to place he said I have no more fear Wow a place to have no more fear well he knew he left he left the guy in the control in the control room have the control likes always supposed to be but let's get back to this so we come back and we just went through seal number five which is the great seal of the Bible showing that a group of people that didn't even want Redemption got redeemed and then but they had to go to a process it wasn't just anything that's not greasy grace greasy grace is just will do what you want to know they had to be a fifth sealed you there had to be a Jew that gave his life for what he believed in under being a Jew not just every Jews gonna be in that fifth seal no no there's some scoundrels is going to be scoundrels and they're gonna come up at the white throne judgment and they're going to be judged as scoundrels so it's just going to be a fifth seal Jews oh that believe who they were and had the testimony they held the testimony they held that's nuts no different in you and I it's the testimony we hold is what's gonna take us in the rapture it's good testimony that we holds what's going to change our body our testimony is we which are alive and remain not we're going to go by the grave we just keep got to keep believing that until we walk into it so the fifth seal is a great seal that give grapes to somebody that didn't even want it now the sixth seal we're coming up to the sixth seal and we're looking at that it's going to be through two prophets and then it's going to be three through two prophets and they're going to call cause all nature to be in their control now the problem with that and Adam when Adam controlled nature it was not falling at that time so the two prophets that's thing about this little while ago the two prophets have to deal with fall in nature to get it to roll back the other direction they're not DC Adam went from he come when God put him on the earth and put him in a human body it was just complete and utter peace I don't believe that there was any thunder and lightning and storms and when there wasn't even any clouds in the sky so the Bible says it was all watered from the ground but when all that other stuff when all the sin happened then what Adam do he lost the control of that so what's the second Adam comes on the earth sure he has control he raises the dead but he also takes fish and makes thousands of fish out of one fish or two fishes five lows he takes and makes thousands of loaves of bread he puts his back foot on the bow of a boat and says peace be still and there's probably a lot of other things that weren't put in the Bible that he did that we don't know anything about but still we know that that he was the he was the master of the sea he was the one that could they could control nature amen and so now that we have that person inside of us but also not just have that person inside of us but have that person inside of us being able to work back with the word that he preached and it be truth because he has the honor of the truth of the word he does not have to honor the false he actually he can under the falls he has the honor what he said so the truth of the word is we're saying now what he said when he said I and my father are one now back down through the denominations they will say I am my father one of the three right one of the three well they got it wrong but now we come up to the end time and we see that now we have the message of the hour that we know that one true and living God is one person one man and that we don't have to deal with all that other that's why to restore by that's that's what we're missing as too weird to be restored back even just to the first church angel but then carry it on further carry it on to the coming of the Lord carry it on to as brother Dale's talking about this is the seventh church age we got some things in there that we got to deal with but right now we're dealing with the seals that we can we can see that there is a listen there was not a chance in the world for Martin Luther to take about a change in the condition and the word he was under he was barred just like Jesus was barred from coming up brother Brown said Jesus when he died he could have come right back out of the grave but he was held by scripture that says he had to be in the earth I told not a total of three but within four three days and three nights right so you and I are held by Scripture the Jews are held by everybody as hell even God Himself is the bound by his own work so being bound by his own word there is a group of people that's going to take a body then there is a group of people that will do that period so why can't we see that you and I can be that because we're in the position doesn't matter how old you are this thing is gonna happen real quick amen I believe it will I believe it'll happen really really fast once once we get out of that interval I want to get to that so much I think we're in that interval I told you there was an interval between 6 & 7 always read your Bible six and seven trumpets six and seven different things sixth and seventh seal there's always six seals stop because remember the property God said six seals finishes Redemption the seventh seal brings him back to the earth all right so we'll get into those quotes a little bit later on but we've got to cover this sixth seal so the sixth seal then is dealing with the earth the natural ball you live on but also it's dealing it has to deal with the earth you're living in because you live in a fallen nature this thing's failed cuz look it's getting older let's agree this is getting older but he doesn't have to and it's not going and finding something to stretch your skin and make you know Michael don't you laugh giving time you're gonna look you look like brother Colley so looking about college sounds like that's what you're gonna look like when you get over them he's fainted but that six heal though is dealing then aren't we've been dealing with a lot of things that v still we're dealing with with something that's six sealed to me is it's an intimate seal intimate seal it's an intimate thing that covers you you right here now I'm sure we're gonna lie if I ever get time I'm gonna talk about the seal but when we get into the spiritual part of it see it's intimate to you because it's something that's gonna happen this ever happened before except to one guy so to me that's intimate it's only gonna happen to the bridegroom and part of the bride and I said part of the bride but now eventually it's gonna be all the bride listen we were turning libeling remain that's going to get a glorified body we were talking about last night the Bible says we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the Trump of the godless sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain so see they're going to get out we read a few quotes where brother Brown said they will be changed first alright they're gonna come up in a glorified body they're no come up in their natural body and then be changed come on people they're not gonna come up in their natural body and have brother Branham change their body that's the doctrine folks that's returned ministry doctrine remember the little tent thing where people going through the tent you know and getting healed they're all saying brother Browns got to come back put the tent up he's gonna speak you're glorified body now that's baloney that's hogwash how much effort you want that's a lie Jesus Christ is the only ones gonna change your body here William Branham is depending on us to take his message quicken his message in this dimension to get him out of that dimension he cannot do us any good in another dimension he cannot but boy what he preached in this dimension let's get it we gotta get it first he'd give it to us he handed it to a bride a mini membered body for us to get what he's talking about what about a man greatest ministry in the world same way with Jesus and at the end of his ministry he had nobody around him and nobody understood him remember Jesus did go to the upper room and tarry till you receive power from on high they had no power but when the Holy Ghost came he give them power same way brother Branham I believe when he was talking on the questions and answers on the seals he said you're not getting it it's not for you ma'am we've already read this not for that group of people he was preaching to a group of people that would not come to what he was talking about but he knew there was a group coming because the Bible says we which are alive and remain well we are we until we pass away we are away we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the dead in Christ shall rise first but there's got to be something go on in our nature no not our not our soul our soul just as eternal as God is it's not as eternal as God is it is God it's a peace of God it is they what it is the last and morphe of God - the Gentile church so it's God made manifest in human flesh called put your name in there all right so that nature is what I'm dealing with I've got to deal with mine you got to deal with yours as we were talking about this morning brother Dale's not gonna change your body there's not gonna be a laying on of hands to change your body no it's gonna be the preaching of the word it's gonna be the quickening that you have in your heart not collective it's gonna be individual some here some there some asleep some not maybe we want to give pens that's what we need when you appeal poke your neighbor poke your neighbor and wake them up if you don't have a neighbor and you're in trouble but this to me this is life to me this is heading toward to me this is the honing down this is the part that we come into that if you miss it you just miss it you just miss it and it's not whose fault your fault my fault we can't pour it down your throat that's why I said this sick seal to me is the most intimate seal you still know the intimate seals getting born-again you got to get born again but getting born again is a piece of the puzzle this guy's not born again but there's a promise that this guy can be born again there's a promise there's a message there's 1,100 sermons to somebody that this guy right here is going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye promised by God and if he promised it he's going to have to make it come to pass he will have to make it come to pass you say wait you know what we do we go with our West here we go with our list I can't do this I can't do that I what that's what was Moses his problem he said I can't even talk God said don't got your brother standing beside you he can do the talking for you all right same way with us with them I we can't talk we can't share the message with now don't worry about it don't worry about it let God work in your life that's the whole thing I you know because when I want you to when I want you to say I am I don't want you to see I don't want you to see that it's that I'm gonna do it it's the I am when you say that word I am to Christian we know who that is that's not you that wasn't Moses that wasn't even the burning bush the burning bush wasn't the I am the burning bush was a cover to cover the I am because Moses couldn't see him that okay but now you and I don't have a burning bush sure we have a burning bush experience but we see the man inside that bush called the I am and then the I am listen as great as Moses was see to me this is the whole seventh seal though the Rideau Moses was the greatest man to walk on the face of the earth during that time beside Jesus Christ but he wasn't Jesus Christ and he wasn't a bride he did not have God dwelling in his soul as a new birth as a believer as a bride he did not have that he had an anointing on him not in him you do come on and you have enough word to make you come to pass Moses was making his own word as he went now I don't mean that you understand what I'm saying if you say well he's making it up as you went night in savings making it up he was writing the Bible as he went my brother down with somebody he was present what he was doing he was writing at one time Moses died well sure he wrote about it before but there was a time when he stepped into that same way with you and I it's become prophecy until you and I step into that prophecy and see what happens in this sixth seal there's two prophets step into that prophecy that we're going to read in a minute about revelations 11 or 7 that's a that 11 where the two prophets come they've got to step into that well now you and I though are already left so we've already stepped into what we which are alive and remain but we've got to come to a place of total sanctification where our nature has changed you say well we got a nature change when we born again yes we did but we still have problems memory reasons and conscious how many times have we said this memory reason conscious affection imagination that's our problem not the inside God right it's that middle man that's what these sales were for it's the middle man I don't think I've said it that hard but that inside man can get born again and never hear about the seals Paul never heard about him did he Peter never heard the seal one two three four five six seven sure they heard it in Matthew when Jesus preached it did they understand it they didn't understand a word he was saying come through all that body change come through all that getting the grave come through all that and right before he goes up the milk drinkers in the crowd are you going to restore the kingdom now right you know what they said are you gonna restore the kingdom now and he probably went wait for 11 more days wait for the damn Pentecost when that damn Pentecost comes I'll be able to tell you what I'm talking about because I'll be in you doing the talking but at the time he was standing there all that like I'm telling you all that great thing they thought he would come to take over they thought he'd come to conquer you know Roman you know all these people they just thump him out of Israel look what happened after he left they destroyed that place time has totally wiped off the map so it wasn't that Jesus was going to restore that Kingdom he's restoring a heavenly kingdom a secret kingdom and that's what you and I live we live in a secret world well you better live in a secret world because if you don't you living in the world where the devil's got control of what you're doing what brother Brown say brother Brown said if I speak it the devil can do something with it he said but if I hold it in my heart he can't do anything with him hold this message what didn't Mary hold that message in your heart and let God work on it hold that message that's why I said this sixth seal to me is an intimate seal it's you say well what about still 1 through 4 yes but like I said before how its intimate that God can live in your soul we think it's an impossibility that he can live in your spirit and definitely he's not gonna live in your flesh now come on people we've had this hard thing in our brain that we can't do this that's why we go ask why we put his sister in the ground a few days ago when we put people in the ground but there's a group of people that's going to take such a nature change so it's going to change the whole person if I don't get to this one I'm gonna get the rest of it done let's let's go back to let's go to the fifth seal I've give you a little bit of background so I can read this real quick we got communion today too so notice we come to this fifth seal now there's no writer goes forth and there's no beast to announce it the lamb opened it and John saw it there was no one there to say now come look and see no power of the living creature are there on the sixth seal there's no beast to announce it it was just what John saw all right and on the seventh seal there's no beasts to announce that no power to announce that no one doesn't on the look after the fourth seal there's no announcement by any beast power from the fifth sixth or seventh not at all so I'm saying it's become intimate it's become God hiding himself in simplicity he's hid himself in a group of people that the seals were gonna be able to open to you to me that's intimate that's why you're a special group of people that's why you're prophetic people all the people with prophetic insight you'll me read all that to you if you've been reading your church age book is in the first few pages right first part of that lesson that's us we're an intimate people we are we have an intimate relationship with Christ sure every Christian does but listen he wants more he wants more he wants more of relationship listen here I'll cover that later I'm not gonna cover it now talk about Adam in the garden we'll talk about Adam and garnet later because remember even Adam in the garden was not exactly the total way God wanted to deal with with man even though Adam had complete control over everything brother Brown said his body was being renewed it was not eternal God wants you to walk in an eternal body because he's in an eternal body he came down here in a flesh body so that we can live and eat it in an eternal body what a mighty God alright let's look at number two back to the sixth seal now earthquake let us compare scripture got pencils and paper I want you to do something for me if you want to write this down unless you're gonna take the tape now I want you to read this I want you to read with me as we as you do compare scripture of this great event that will see that this great secret of mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of Redemption I just want to keep getting that in your mind because sometimes we say all right this is Redemption Redemption and all of a sudden something wanders off in your mind well what's this got to do with Redemption all six seals brother man says six seals finishes Redemption because the seventh seal there's nothing redeemable in the seventh seal that's Christ himself pretty simple that's why they silence in heaven for half an hour now remember these are hidden mysteries in the sixth seal altogether is one great big book just sits Scrolls roll together because if six seals finishes Redemption there's really not a seventh seal in the Bible the whole Bible is the seventh seat right but this what says I remember these are hidden mysteries the six seals altogether is one great big book he doesn't say seventh he says six because the six seals finishes Redemption that's why we don't need the Bible any more physical Bible once we're totally redeemed once you're totally redeems you don't need to carry Bible realm with you you are the Bible you are every scripture you are every person you are every manifestation of God for your day and agen for your time all right who believes that who believes that you know what some of your sitting here and didn't raise your hand and these three kids in the back raising their hand just six girls to get unwinds the whole book of Redemption so when six see it listen when six seals are revealed you're redeemed when six that we're all waiting for that seventh we're waiting for the seventh the seventh is open that's not open whatever you want to do let's continue with the six because six seals finishes redemption if you do that automatically the seventh is there in manifestation that okay with that it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth [Music] now take your finger and do this this is the earth we're talking about that's the earth he's talking about but once we do that the whole world's gonna be redeemed listen we're not gonna come back now we will in the Millennium be careful we will in the Millennium not come back to a redeemed entire earth everybody do this devil still alive his demons are still alive there's a lot of things we got to deal with in the Millennium because remember the Millennium is to the Jews there's a thousand years of rain ar e IG n thank you Jim she's kept graced me with my spelling she helps me the the rain on end the millennium is to the Jews for a thousand years the son of David we've already covered all that not until the future home brother branham said that future home now sits on a redeemed entire earth but you and I have to have the redeemed entire earth to begin with this earth for that Earth to come this way listen when we leave this place it's called the wrath of God for a purpose because who's holding back the wrath of God this world is doomed this earth is doomed listen if we don't get a body change this earth is doomed cuz it's going to go to a grave but thanks be to God we know by opening of the seal that you and I are already redeemed we just got to come back through the process of bringing this guy back but those who are alive and remain don't have to go back through that we get it right here alright hey listen even Jesus had to go into another dimension and come back and pick up his body to make you glorified he had a process he had to go through that's why you and I this is still a process we have to go through we have to see that the fifth seal is the seal of grace to you the sixth seal is a changing of the whole natural world but it's a changing of your nature that we'll get into maybe a little bit later on but let's finish this steel part now let's go to number three now what is this sixth seal the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period and let me read again what the meaning of tribulation is that very meaning of that word in the Bible where it says we go through tribulation is affliction pressure or anguish now what takes place the bride has gone there's no living creature nothing there to say it now everybody understand when we talk about living creature we're talking about the Holy Ghost we're talking about the lying ox man in the Eagle we're talking about the Holy Ghost inside of you listen when we leave this earth when we leave this earth at a moment's time there's nothing to be any Holy Ghost except in two prophets in the whole world Loui whole world only two people are going to have the Holy Ghost now there's 144,000 coming but it looks so dark and so weak but that's the greatest time ever because we're already gone we've already took a body change we're already out of here is not dealing with the church anymore it's been gone he's dealing with Israel see see this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation God's servant nation and when when when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom age is where David the son of David sits on the throne see the 144,000 got to come together accept the message of the hour be killed take a rapture and then they got to come back and build a Millennium temple and be the servants of that temple and then you and I come into that temple we know that's explained in Daniel 70 weeks but Israel must receive the message of the two prophets before the son of David can sit on the throne so there's still a process to go through everybody with me say Amen to get the son of David on the throne that's for Israel not for us we're in a wedding supper we're somewhere else we're on our honeymoon we're actually having an extended honeymoon that continues another thousand years when we get down there amen they're all right but we are nations we are individuals you and I have to come to the Statue of a perfect man and all these other things as an individual so it's not a church it's an individual all right let's do number four real quick excuse me and I beheld when he opened the sixth seal that was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted see God's been doing great things like healing the sick opening on the block eyes of the blind doing great things he's doing that now hey man but we find out here that nature took a tumble yes all nature look what taking place the earthquake the Sun went black the moon wouldn't give its light the Stars shook and fell and why everything happened see right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcing of those martyrs right here the martyrs this sealed you martyrs see the martyrs had been finished all right now let's go to number four no I'm sorry number five sorry so if Nate now look if nature took a tumble then it's got to come back to the other way so what we're talking about a few minutes ago nature's got to come back hey man we don't know what this world looked like before the before the flood but boy after the flood we know what it looks like but before the flood we don't but we're going to because we're gonna see it not in the Millenium I just don't believe in the millennium everything's going to be changed and then it's gonna stay that way no because remember in the millennium at the Battle of Armageddon over here is going to be an atomic war we'll cover that because it says that your skin will fall off of your body while you're standing and that's an atomic nuclear war and it's gonna take a while for everybody to die mmm that's just the way I see it I see it that a millennium we can come back and we can see this building right here if it had been completely down because it's not always it's not all the way brought back again but now the future home why do we go up on the breadth of the earth if God's not fixing to let this thing go he'll really stay brother Ram said they're really being noise then when he takes and then he destroys all this Devils puts the earth right back to the way it was in the Garden of Eden that's just the way I see it and then we'll come down on a redeemed entire earth nothing will have to be changed but in the Millennium things are gonna have to be changed because that temples not the place we're living that's not our living quarters that's not the future home in the Millennium our future home comes after the thousand years so this is all going to be destroyed again we've covered that many many times what not have to look cross-eyed to see it because remember the Millennium is a space of time we are still in time in the Millennium I just agree with that shake your head if you agree that's time time and eternity is two different things now we're eternal and we can live in time but we can't have an eternal future home in the Millennium you know what happened we got to go through the thousand years man's got to live a thousand years right then the millennium is gonna end then the white throne judgment then we're gonna take and go into the future home where everything is laid out exactly by your desire we in the millennium it's not our desire its Israel son of David we're just down we're allowing a vacation like like you know you take and go to Alaska or somewhere well you know what then people live there you're there just on the vacation that's not your home see that even helps when we the song came to my mind this world is not my home I'm just a passenger well no that's not true that's not true according to them it is yeah but according to my revelation this is my home now the very state of it being right now is not my home but it is my home this is where I'm gonna live cuz you know what when brother Brent preaches the future home he destroyed another old doctrine that the denominations have that we're all going to what heaven we're all going to level the clouds where I want to we're coming right back here God's gonna just wipe it off and we're gonna come right back down on top of it hey man where we know the sixth seal is the judgement seal so now remember word is brother branham say judgment starts at the house of God so our judgment seal is right here this one said this is going to be intimate every time you walk in the door the sixth seal has to open need because if you're born again God's not trying to change you're born again he's trying to change the next guy the guy that when you go outside and somebody cut you off on the highway hello oh that doesn't happen y'all anymore okay I just let you sit there and think about that for a minute good to see you but we know that next six seal is the judgment seal because what is our final judgment even our final judgment is we were talking about this morning the bride has the final judgment I read it in Romans this morning of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad we're going to give an account of what we do in this body that we have so said the Bible but like brother Brown says you either gonna get rid of it here and not have to deal with it later are you gonna keep it here and you got to deal with it later all right so why can't we come to the judgment seat of God and get rid of it brother Brown says you either get what better or worse when you ly6 steal folks six seal I just got that myself just now six seal this is the judgment house you either get rid of it or you keep it with you when you walk out that door it's the judgment steal exactly now we've had the Antichrist ride seeing the church go now it's finished goes up then we see the martyrs with them Jews back there under the altar that's the fifth seal now here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth the 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove that they are Jews and not Gentiles they have nothing to do with the bride not one thing the bride we done seen the bride leave all right so we don't go to any tribulation right here we can't place that anywhere else don't come back again until the nineteenth chapter well he says the book of Acts we know we meant the book of Revelation everybody okay with that say man okay I don't want to get hung up with that that's the book of Revelation now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word he changed we didn't change it he just brought more revelation he said to judgment seal the earth or the judgment seal of all nature now he's bringing the judgment seal of the word and see that's what makes it so intimate because we're supposed to be Word people we're supposed to be a word born bride I say we are I don't say we're supposed to be we are one hey man we good with this that all right let's read this one and then we'll finish let's go to revelations 11 because this is the seal brother Brown said those two prophets are the sixth seal right all right and that was giving me a reed like unto a rod the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles remember the Gentiles can go in the outer court and the Holy City shall they tread under foot foot forty and two months how long is that twelve months times three is thirty six and six more is what 42 alright so here we go now that's not 42 of our months that's 42 prophetic months of 30 days because you can't make it fit with a thousand two hundred and threescore you can't fit 1260 days into our three and a half year calendar it won't fit because there's 28 days in this month we're in now 31 in January 30 in March you see what I mean back and forth but they're going to prophesy for 1,260 days two witnesses clothed in sackcloth now look at that word they shall prophesy you keep these things in mind because you're going to remember we're gonna pop up one day and preach the sermon on what same claim brother Dale preached on one time those who prophesy must die because remember what you're doing you're prophesying you're doing this what are you saying there's coming a group of people right there's coming a group of people well that's not you you're prophesying of a group to come but we need to be prophetic people to understand what the prophets saying and have prophetic insight but not have prophecy or prophesy of another group to come that's been our problem who in the world have heard back when you were in denomination well we're not gonna see it in our day but we know the Lord's coming they keep doing what they keep what prophesy a group is coming well they're gonna run up against the wall somewhere they got to cuz there has got to be a group well it's not our day now we're not gonna see that but now maybe somebody else will see that what are they doing they're saying we don't have enough to get us there and you know what they're saying they're prophesying their self out of that group even brother Branham he was the Prophet he prophesied of a group to come don't throw anything please I'm old but those who prophesy must die he prophesied of a group of people coming the Bible is full of prophecies about what about a group of people to come so then all the other ones are what passed on because they're not that group but why can't we say we're that group that the whole Bible's talking about because remember they're gonna prophesied and then they're gonna die huh hello those are the two olive trees and to count sticks standing before the god of the earth now we know what happens they have power to shut heaven they have power to water turn it to blood smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will something's going on here and when they finished their testimony verses let's go to verse 7 the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them remember just like I told everybody the other day I think I mentioned that here we were talking outside you got God is is in continuity what he does he pretty much does because what he done when he came to earth when he came to earth for three and a half years they tried to kill it man but he had to get a message out even he prophesied so he had to die hello right he prophesy he was a prophet he had to die cuz he was what talking to me and you he was speaking of her people right but when that anointing came on Jesus on the River Jordan for three and a half years they tried to kill him couldn't kill him it left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he died brother Branham let's take it to this time now brother Branham three and a half year when this the seals open there was an anointing that came down that there was nothing can happen to that prophet till he finished his message then when that lifted off of him 1965 he passed away I'm telling you the bride of Jesus Christ has got to have that same anointing because that's the anointing of the headstone of the message of the hour that when that anointing comes on us we can't die but we got to keep that anointing here and we're commission too but those didn't what does that brother Brown say the spirit that was on us lifts off of us I'll bring you the quote later lifts off of us and goes where the Israel it anoints them for how long three and a half years the same anointing don't you think the Mossad and the FBI and the CIA and they I in new a a o you wants to kill them about two weeks into their message especially the Mossad they're gonna go when you get rid of these two guys but still being anointing for three and a half years because the Bible said they'll prophesy for 1,260 days and then wasn't going to do at the end of that 1260 days there is no prophecy to go any further so that prop that anointing lifts off of them and they are right there they're killed but you and I the difference in you and I on all the rest of them you and I keep that anointing and we take a body change because don't you think they're gonna want to kill us our own ranks are gonna want to kill us it's not that the badness don't care anything about us who put Jesus in the Judas hmm right that okay Moses you killed the people of God and the witness that in the Bible when God told him through Moses he said you come and stand right here if you for me stand here if you against me stand over there over there the ground opened up swallowed all them good believers and hello and the ground swallowed them up two days later they go to Moses Moses you killed the people of God right cäcilie but that's exactly what happens to always in your own range all right let's read this one quote and then well then we'll take communion I'm sorry I was gonna try to quit at 3:30 but here's what read this quoting then we'll start back on it next week this is on the sixth seal I could say something awful good right here but I guess I'll hold it till tomorrow night I have power over the water to turn over the blood smite the earth with plagues as often as they will what is it what can bring these things but the two prophets but it's the word first what can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to hear it is their the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open it up they gotta come to a realization what they're here for don't you and I have to do the same thing you gotta come to a realization why you're on this earth when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here why are we gonna be an invincible armed invincible army because will not be profits at that time will not be proper saying will be it okay see the six seal is completely an interruption of nature do you get it now there's your seal there's to see a look look at me look at me there's the seal that's that little bar that was sealed but now what's written underneath that we got to get okay cuz see that really doesn't that doesn't do us any good for us to be here when we see earthquakes and you better not be here but when God deals with your nature on this side of the rapture that's on the other side this is only I'm telling you this is on this side it's a complete interruption of nature because nobody's ever had this done before even Jesus did Jesus had to die and can be resurrected in the glorified body we're talking about skipping that amen do you get it now there's your seal who does it it's the prophets on the other side of the rapture with the power of God the Word of God they just condemned nature that's the same way you and I are gonna have to do starting with this nature they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood the Sun can go down or anything at their command amen there you are there you are see how the seals opened up down through in the church age how it showed the martyrs and now here's these two prophets standing here with the Word of God to do anything to nature they want to and they shape the earth and it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah because there's their ministry Rhian personated again both men oh my do you see it now what the sixth seal is it's those prophets now notice don't let it choked you but

under control it can only be put under control by the Word of God we've tried for 50 years to beat it in our flesh we wasted a lot of time but it had to be we just had to be we had that we had to have it but it was a it was let's don't say it was a waste of time it was it prolonged the inevitable that we can come to a place to where that we can take a body change in this hour not because your dress is dragging the ground not cause your sister don't cut your hair you men do cut your hair you do this you don't do that or you do this you don't do that it's because what's inside of you is gonna do what's inside of you is gonna change your body let's bow our head the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would take the feeble words that's been spoken and drive them straight to the heart of each and every one of us that will see that we are truly not prophesying of something to come we are truly living the prophecy we are as you told when you were here on earth you said before Abraham was I am in other words the ever-present God and you've made yourself known here now in the end time has the ever-present God not a God that's still hanging on the cross or a god that's coming - coming down here they open all the graves no it's all gonna be done in secret right here in the bride of Jesus Christ and you gave us a prophet to prophesy and tell us the things that are going to happen so we don't have to be a prophet or prophesy of another group coming we are that group we are the I am we are the ever-present Lord I don't want you to be with me tomorrow because you might miss me today
