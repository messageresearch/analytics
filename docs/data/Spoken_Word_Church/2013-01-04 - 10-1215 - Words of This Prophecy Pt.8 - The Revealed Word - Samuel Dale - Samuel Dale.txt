questions down and and things your thoughts and when we get through speaker a lot along with us how questions and answers and we can you know it look good and I to know where they meant we appreciate

woods I reckon but it's make sure that nobody else don't find it he can cancel it know like heaven but his pray that the Lord would would take care of that amen so we'll just remember that now and pray it you know all of the things would be as we enter Europe in time that when each day we move forward in time is one day short of eternity so we just move up one more day one more day is because that much closer home so just remember that also remember now the bible study will be the second saturday in january because the first saturday beyond the first so it won't be that to be the second standard remember that revelations one deer running me clean up how do we thank you for you loving your grace we thank you for everything we prayed as you would just bless each one of us Lord and understanding that you would open our hearts that we may see you because that's desire we want to see you revealed in your word and Lord we know that it's promised us so we can depend upon that if have your way now as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and direct each one remember the sick among us and you said you said you ordered healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe in we thank you just have your way down and keep us in Jesus name Amen and we've been reading from revelations one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and all the things that he saw unless it is he that readeth and they that you're the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand I believe it's time to understand what you I believe it's time to understand okay you're only 29 very familiar with all of us verse 29 the secret things belong to the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belong to us into our children forever that we may do all the words of this love you may be seated devoted his blessing to the reading of the word now remember that we will be getting back to it more to cover but I believe we're just getting enough of the word of God revealed to us here to be able to comprehend when we get there No so that's why I like that scripture see the secret things belong under Lord our God there are things that he will not reveal to us while we're here upon this earth but we'll have an eternity of a never-ending revelation from God's Word to be able to rejoice in and see those things so you know is I'm looking forward to it but I'm still want to make sure one thing that we get the foundation right here and then getting it right here then we can him you know be ready for that day but now what we've been talking about in the book of revelations that this book is the only book in the Bible where as Jesus personally appearing to ascribe dirac that's pates 13 church age book and he he came to him in a way that there's not been trying to get you to see because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave unto him all right there were some things he didn't know he didn't know his part in the kingdom the Prophet said but actually come to the Isle of Patmos then um he did know because he had come from God and went back to God so he was there and had great understanding the brain of John on Patmos and he said was signified it by his angel to John to where the John could hide it down and bring it up to us we'll always well and good but my point has been one thing you remember it that no matter if an angel comes to you it speaks to you or whatever even no matter what it would be if God doesn't come on the scene to show that that's correct what good is all of that see and Paul said even if an angel come from heaven and bring something contrary to what he's saying it now that's pretty strong in but i still believe its work don't you a bit i'm actually then brother branham couldn't come in and bring us anything different from what Paul hair he would be under that curse but see we're trying to get to the point to see what is taking place and there in the first chapter we see that the fact that I did he's revealing to join my way of the angel but Jesus Christ steps on the scene now that's the point that I've been trying to make into three services and I want to make sure you get that will try to cut a little short tonight and Boyd cut a little short on the scene will cut a little short cut of the bad weather and to make sure no problem is going home but now we put the emphasis and we all believe in God sends angels when Smith services expressing what they were but they were ministering spirits and forth the ministers to the heirs of righteousness and then it went from ministering spirits as far as as those things we went through showing that it was angels were ministers messengers on earth you know and coming down here to work that it wouldn't ministering and they watch after your soul all right you'll see then it we found out that it's all the operation of the Holy Spirit but it's not to just say well that's just the Holy Spirit see your lumping it into a way that you're not allowing God to be able to reveal himself the way he wants to I believe he wants to make known to each and every one of us his ways his actions his character his desires his whole being is what he's trying to reveal to you now well if we cut short on anything see then we're losing part of that I made a statement at the end of the life service and i speaking i said there is even attributes of god that he has not displayed well I'm sure that's race from eyebrows by some but I still believe it because if there's a message of cheer down to the endless ages to come then there is more of God to reveal and then you reach neuter only 29 29 the secret thing belonging to god though there are some things that you won't tell us why we're here but we're going to get enough here to go that honor that's what we're here for is to get that done and now what I want to do tonight this is the thought of my night now I want you and I to stop one thing that we're doing I say may you all of us we're limiting God because of the fact of the way we think and the way we do now this is what's been on my heart so you know the way we do is we we say go I can do all things but then we turn around and say well but many he don't want to do it night we see you're putting a limit on God and what he can do because he's waiting on you and I now will get down to it a little bit in the message of me you know that see jesus said I am the vine you are the branches now a fine doesn't bear fruit it's the branch that runs off of that right you take even your grapevine that you look at you know and it runs out and all now it may have little stuff grows out here and younger cuz that that but get the line point is what is you cut it back in your pruning actually right back to the vine and it put out a new brain when it puts out a new branch darts where your fruits going to it so I believe God's waiting on you and I baby you know that's my whole thing thinking about for probably a week or so now that that we limit God in the basis that were not releasing the faith that we actually have I believe we have faith prophet said you have faith he said you just don't know what to do with it you don't know how to turn it loose alright and see by having any doubt in our mind of anything that God has promised I'm not worried about what he ain't promised you know that's what am I tried to figure out they want to write some great something that they can't find the Bible to back up what they're doing and entitle bring it like a man told me one time did he wouldn't he wasn't working on commanding the devil anymore he was working on commanding the Lord because the Bible said command Z me I said that's not exactly what that's being safe well that's what it said you know he would tighten of the answer we don't need food with it but you see we're trying to make something else out of it instead of just simply taking what God says don't you simply believe in who we are right and that's what I've tried to do with with a whole part we're home and you know for years and I've said this to you that the book of Revelation doesn't show Jesus Christ by himself it doesn't you know it shows him in bright form aren't sure the two witnesses or it'll show the things like that it doesn't show him by himself because he chose it to be that way he wants you and I to realize we were part of this the prophet of God said to God hath not complete without you when I don't seem to their way now I could agree with that about run around now but but I just don't know was sitting in your stopping God he can't manifest what he wants to write a min me I believe that the word has been brought in to us me to wear that we can stand upon I know what a lot of people think they said oh it's just intellectualism well then where has your spirituality broadly right not something them say my sarcastic understand it like it is where is what you think is the great spirituality that if it's not you know if it's just if we have the word intellectually there's one thing about it we've got the word in the field Oh God gotta do this quick it but if you don't have it to feel you can't quit my job you go ahead see that's what we're doing we're allowing the devil to beat upon us to the basis that we're cutting off what God really wants to do I don't bring bread around made that statement one down you know it really shocked me said God wants you healed more than you would be healed no only who I'm not thinking about them and I'm sorry I'm just talked like I am but you don't have a lot of people in this world would never admit there he'll even if they will just doesn't want to draw her Social Security check Rep know what you one college yeah we're landing at work that I admire him he went out on a medical retirement on his nerves and you know he said it had some antique abstaining so he begged him let him come back to work he's already retired that everything sealed up house he go out on your nerves you when talking about a nub doctor who says you back to work and you know that put him back to work you know I'm Marty because he he wanted to get back to work he didn't want to let lay around he could light around draw it almost as much money as he did work I'm learning for them so you because that man he had something with me but not get my point I believe God is trying to reveal to you and I'm who we are and revealing who we are is automatically resilience al-abed because that's who it is you remember how we were bringing out the other day that then you go through just just one incoming of Revelations one and then when you get a chapter 2 a 3 so dramatically red-letter all the way it's showing Jesus Christ in His Church it's not showing just the Turk it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's doing down to the seven churches in his bride see then we look at Devon we say well we don't I just don't know I don't know God has already read that all about you and i we're not writing it brother cure it's not something we've got to make manifest from God can write it down right he's already wrote it out of what it was going to be now you think you don't change his mind no he's just wanting you and I believe it but she seems that you start talking like that and people just sign up on but you get to talking about how that they run around Carla jano pathless holding its turn up and get up lead it moon so happy or preach some false doctrine and they're just all over the place when you just simply start talking about the word no let's do a slow listener well where's your spirituality brother right you said well it's like not happening around little show me worse having anymore come on I've told you before i put up his church against any church and this message as to why he's taking buddy's and the signs and wonders has been among us that's not bragging that telling the truth would you see we're make that we're letting the devil take away from us the opportunity to be what he's already said we are he's already wrote the book about us the book of Revelation is your book it's written about to details every age and what it is sure there was the bad part that's all people would leave after that heart cause you had to speak to two churches remember the true vinyl in the fox run is in the church ages but the true vine always got the promise to the overcame night event and what is the last one to sit with me in my throne as I sit my father and his from now that's the promise in the last days that you and I are to sit in the word could you remember the last message what was it the Word made flesh Jesus Christ was the Word made flesh we accept that but then when you come down through the ages well it don't go up there what was it the Living God manifesting himself right the Word made flesh right right and the thing that it is we are to come down here until according to do melech ha for we are to be turned back to the fight right the father's right but where do you hear that top does it's just this great big thing that we're in our the great Nuland or whatever you know in Russia Sean so really he's got that going down man what going all I'm trying to bring to you that is the reality of one thing God has already said what this bride will be in in time right they don't matter to me how many Devils in he'll have to take that away it ain't gonna change but then we don't believe we're part of it you know what we're on if we can't accept what God said about you and I we can't do it the prophet of God I gave it to you there the other we can get it back to you tonight one-on-one against organized religion look what he says born from above you can read it turn flesh word flesh in you we gotta be born from above not going from the earth born from above look what he says and flees to the trumpets right down below it number two that the Word made flesh gives the light of the age the Word made flesh is the light of the image now you show me worded that down through the ages that that work with my flesh and those people see if we don't want to look at it anyway then when we do then we can't accept the fact of what God says about this ain't the word has got to be made flesh in you and the probably said spoken words original signal for you enough that birth of the word is Christ amen man living in email the word hmm John 15 pfizer what I told met a woman who I am the vine you are the branches we burned the fruit we're under the fruit let me see if we doubt what kind of fruit it is or what God has said about us how can he do anything I'm always told you about you know that the guy that broke that left four minute mile with postal never walk who never been able to run to know what they forgot to tell me you know what he broke four minute mile why because he didn't live in itself the bumble bees wings fred is so small until it is impossible for him to fly would you know that it's nick till the bumblebee Jill if I could ever get it to anyone fly just getting you to at least go did fun see where we're making ourselves to the basis that we're not taking what the scripture says about us we want to know what it said a lot somebody else like I said where is it important to find it that run around coming to John Pappas I want to know who trying to bring around because that way he can speak to me alright see you by the fruit the Spirit gives life to the word but if we don't have the word where are we just when I'm always just drive it in one thing preach the word huh if the words in the field Holy Spirit can quicken that where I had a min but if it's not in back here another dose already shown them apart from man's grief the holy ghost came Flicka did he can't let a lot of high word false alert do you never happen you never will but you see God has already told what is going to happen in this day do you ever have you ever really just sat down and listened to run around preach and think he's talking about me if nothing else come on did nothing else realize he talking about today you're living in when he would he'll say Fang and you can turn right around and see it taking place but why can't we realize he talking about us who's he talking about where are you still move there's no Lucy that let's go kill us that's what's taking this to the grave in the Bible it says I know whenever jokes it I know then there's no question who's Eddie none right well maybe no no it's a he said I know my redeemer live do you know your redeemer lives why are we cutting God short to the basis that he cannot make manifest among us what he wants to say i want to see God made many things I want to praise him for what he's doing I want to praise him for what he had done but I want to see him living the reality in our lives not to just sit around go to church and be good you know we're done just getting older you right out but look go down to number seven on your nose I'm just trying to shorten else get the point of what i want you to see Christianity versus on dollar tree I Drive 190 190 61 1217 you saw matter we are made part partakers of his holiness we in His image we are living in our living images of living gone right then Davis elf raised with him now listen listen to this His Word made flesh again and us over the Neville look what is it not the mythical imaginary god sitting out there but the Living God aim is not what it says what is the Living God money sonny the word in you making itself real now it's is where they read that wording brother branham making several where Jesus made several but what did he say the word in you making it slippery wait glory to God oh I know you think I'm a holy roller maybe I am no brother do you see it triumph over ever denomination triumph over all paganism a living God made manifest in a living temple and the Word of God which is God is my flesh in You amen what is the Living God the word in you making it sort of read the words the thoughts are not is what the revealed Word admit we don't like the word my flesh what about to reveal work you know if it's not revealed came in my flesh but do we realize see that's my point if I tried to do for meeting for I don't know 20 years now more I had one in mind to get you and I to look at the book of revelations and to see that that is the book that tells you in hi who we are and what we're doing and what's taking place upon the earth while we're here that's my book the symbols has been broke the profit is told us that's what I was trying to show there I but you know of Revelations 113 through that word speaks of the one stand in the midst of seven golden candlesticks heard about the path for the gold and their families for profits need a bride standing Drona we need to remember this statement that I made two three times before he ever wrote one word about the church ages he'd already showed how perfect time that the bride of Jesus Christ is before he ever said one thing about the bad things of the church ages he already showed how perfectly on he'd already taken the bride and revelations one all the way to the white throne to sit on the throne with him you remember that join how perfect of what he thinks of you and I did he starts talking about the church ages and showing what would actually transpire upon earth before he never even transpired what about a god that could write a prophecy to you not so perfect to show us exactly where we are we believe we're in the seventh search Hetty so what is the message to the seven churches the beginning of the creation of gone and the Prophet said he's the beginning of the creation he said where the rest for that creative look what God has already shown you and I'm he's already shown us perfect already showing us in a rapture who get threatened revelation full one already shown us he never form to be eternal already shown us the city we would actually live me well if I could just find myself in the month when man standing right here one night he said boy I tell you what I found myself he said I found out I was the Antichrist I was that white horse and the rider learn he said then I found myself as ridden NM i found myself is pee on him you know black and then title I mean you know I know what he thought about me but I got up behind him I said those beasts earthy Ronnie you can't convert one then so you just say it you and convertible okay you know cuz everybody was so much oh yeah look at that we just see ourself as to why would we see herself mr. Rick we see our chef is it we see our self is honey that's unconverted less theory on beast that's know those these can be converted the best you can say was what that we was a part of the system yet come we were part of that system that the air crash was riding but don't make us the antique ride you can't retain the Antichrist see people gets all upset when they're back because then I bring out things like that to try to save people so but the one made one time when they got a furnace brother tell him back you know the man wanted more 10 Watson what do you think about it well I didn't know that got into the junk try got it behind him they called on me get up Ernest I got a person was first thing man won't NY ZD he's stupid he's done that's the best way to say and as he ain't got nothing but a less devil only I didn't know the brothers were already planning out the sisters were planning on who to go home with you know what I expose the thing and save the people from going into that tight but you don't want until this day there are not my brother because they don't want to hear me we get to keep people out of the barrel adultery and they turn against you did you see I believe one time I believe this Bible you want to know anything my brother phony were talking about you're right here in this book you can take the quotes you do a lot of fun did you take the quotes in this book and put them together you don't have to worry about the time you come out right amen cause it'll be right I believe that but you can take either one element Liam either way you want to write me with the Prophet come to turn us back to the word amen we were supposed to be turned back to the face of the fathers hello the end the things could happen of the sealed opening the great things to transpire to let us know other times but you see the revealed Word will straighten out the era that is in each one of us amen John sew on patch listen the Lord Jesus Christ the moon not probably physically standing there you know in a corporal body because they would not fit what the point that you're getting too he saw him in Brad form he saw him in the form that God wanted to be to be in his church Johnny so what Jesus was bringing him there God had revealed John some hood it wasn't just an angel telling John John actually saw Jesus standing there they saw anyone brothel he saw you why can't we believe that no one of these days yeah journal pathless saw the Word made flesh in the bride now just run around instead I'm looking unto Jesus and he gave it to you that John the Baptist was the greatest of all number laelia note of all the profits because he saw the Word made flesh Laurette said the other prophets of visions and things John so the Word made flesh but REM sleep that's why he was the greatest of all the prophets and he introduced he behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin in the world john de nino miracles there was not one miracle and John the Baptist his ministry we get everybody wants miracles and signs and wonders I do to become we need even look gimme work then a sound and wonders will follow the word well I've heard you prayed for 40 years and what have you done in the 40 years you've been listening to me this it's just time to be flattened blunt and forget it remember Joe no Padma saw the word that's John the Revelator you know I'm Patman saw the word that john the baptist south on earth John sees in the Book of Revelations the same word made flesh but is in a meeting everybody amen whereas John the Baptist only saw one man John the baddest it behold the lamb of God brother branham I got it later meant to bring it on back to me when I get it to you the other day but a brown said this last night messenger would be pointing to a word born bride right into coming of Jesus Christ to a were born bride John so the revealed Word of each age the code you wrote in chapter 23 are you anyway he saw it so much he wrote it to worth it though the authors when they come along the translators in a different thing when they picked it up they could see that with Jesus leading that's a reasonably red letter right cuz they could see that was personal he was not revealing the world it's hurt he was revealing himself in the ride David he was showing himself into messengers and the candlesticks the bride he we're promised in this last days that merica I for is to restore the original word the original word would mean to be be bringing the bride back to the original position God showed that picture in the book of Revelation a what Malachi 4 was seeing your prophet of God said on one see not our to shut number not only knows what that in the last days the full word would be born into manifestation the full word would be born in the manifestation the seaters where it goes back again well I just don't clear well then you know what the problem is you what what you've done if you've been standing there when john turned around and said behold the lamb of god it takes away the sin of the world would you been hard and crucified what would it be they don't doubt the full word now you know what happens if you doctor foo work turn over to look at number 10 you know this 22 Easter seal 1965 14 he that disbelieves don't believe forward what are you the Prophet says you're a sinner now I didn't say that's your profits it read it you doubt the full word number 10 he that believes not the full Word of God is a sinner that's pretty rough inning look on down to the next one number 11 moderate events made clear by prophecy 65 1206 progressed 78 and when a man's born of the Spirit of God he don't inject anything in through his Blythe it's unadulterated Word of God vindicated for that hour he takes the full word of god he don't put no Creed's nothing else into it it's purely unadulterated God's Word made manifest among what about are we sure will happen that brother Dale I believe the words here you'd run around well I guess that fulfills a whole book of Revelation and I guess we better be in effect me true in that line we better hope that that was brought around to come to John atmos where we have an opportunity to receive something better hope that was pretty random and coming but you see the Book of Revelations is not written about the Prophet is written about the bride the prophets got his part what could be greater if he a spread around the day what would be greater he said to be able to introduce the word John the Baptist introduced the word to the world what Gregor was there any signs or wonders that he needed did he need any proof did he need any great halo light did he need anything to prove what he's safe no but what about brother Brandon he said not call you Brian I call you Brad I like that you know identified masterpiece 64 1205 how we're going to come to heaven then the state how we going to come to heaven then to say well I believe this but I don't believe that now you're gonna do it you've got to be the full word for your part of him your part of him he's showing us in the Book of Revelations now this is the foundation for what I'm doing Sonny effect he's shown her he doesn't show himself he shows himself in her what greater honor could be given to any people then for God to call us his children for him to make us his people for him to say that he's not complete without your name and to turn around in the book of Revelation and show us so beautiful and marvelous that he shows us growing up in Revelations for one now the lord willing what I want to do sundays get on to something that is going to take a while to understand it's like I told you why didn't that angel it read a random was with him from birth why did that angel not tell him about to see he told him a lot of the other things but I come he didn't tell you about to see hmm he called that a minor angel oh of course he's only trying to deceive his home whatever i think you know it's what to do to people told brother Richard I'm not ported this is a quote did they said well around cities you if you you make me Jesus Christ you make me auntie crises oh he just said that to throw you off put it on a good job so he told me so far off I don't believe he's jesus christ but do you understand brother branham see that Jesus Christ is here amen exactly that's number 13 him you know it's really hard graft 40 state come hither quickly he said outside of the Corporal body there's no different than what he was back tired when he isn't but do we believe that I just can't I just can't see it better there cuz if it was we'd be seeing great signs and wonders we are the greatest sign I'm the greatest wonder that could ever be is to see a group of people that would struggle and fight for actually existence of life but to stay with the message of the hour and try to keep it pure and unadulterated from all creeds and ideas like velocity is the greatest miracle is for somebody to get yourself out of the way extending the pulpit and God use them to speak his work what you see John saw in Revelations 113 the bride of Jesus Christ already perfectly beautifully marvelously decked out be like one like a son of man and got were around me what he called it there you know what he told that did he saw her he caught it too son of God not to suddenly you can't have some man until you first get some gum back that's why that angel couldn't tell her to read he couldn't tell because the revelation had not come forth from God and the same is enough will then where would be the problem of coming back to revelations one and seeing that this was the revelation that God gives you Jesus to give the John and sent and signified by the angel what would be the difference in saying this is the revelation of the bride of Jesus Christ that God gave to an angel to deliver unto his bride and then that he himself would step on the scene and manifest himself but did any difference in that Brotherhood and they are saying that will not reach yourself in that we're not read that this is the revelation that God give to Jesus to tell about us right now I selective on down a little bit nuts make far enough it's nothing like far enough you know what it is it's exactly the truth because Jesus the revelation that he didn't understand when he was on earth was his part in the kingdom it's what your prophet

but you see we can't get it all comprehended the comes we got to get our brain involved how did the bride can go up revelations for one and not seen until revelations 1921 very mondo comprehend attachments your prophecy why because she's gonna know the rest of it is Israel in the dribble ice pack and working on he thought so much of us he takes us up before the tribulation you see he's trying to reveal himself in Bride phone the revealed Word of the age that you and I are leaving it to see Christ made manifest that's always on my heart read the book of revelations and see what it says about you may I don't understand all in symbols you prophet told us to sing know you're trying to figure out Antichrist big beast walking around all kind of thing have my King Kong for something like it as soon as you see it that the whole Bible is revealed Jesus Christ and the last book is not revealing himself he's revealing himself in you and I that's the greatest of all revelation what do you think about you want to see yourself read the book of Revelation Thank on this time but this is my sport outro bang this is what John saw in Revelations 113 he saw the word made alive in the people the revealed Word the word made a lot come on decisions what do you think about yes but if we could just see histories see her we're cutting it off see we're letting ourselves if we thank her
