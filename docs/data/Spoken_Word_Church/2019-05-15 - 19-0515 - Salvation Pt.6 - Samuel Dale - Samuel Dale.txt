in [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen and amen and amen take a look around you might find him and good to be in the house of the Lord did you see everybody yeah here on a wintry night or we can have a little time to relax and gonna sit back and talk about the Lord that even come among us and work out a lot of things for us okay I just keep remembering brother dick with Addison I talked to him this afternoon and he's having a lot of troubles with his back he's got about three disc herniated discs right what'd you call him two of them one's messed up real bad and you know which one thing after the other is beating on him so just keep praying for it and hold him up and he was life and said we're all getting old you know so that's that's the point we were all getting old together in that way we can can have a good time in that but you know what we're also getting younger together oh that's that's part of the to know to getting younger and they meant but just remember that and they were to pray for him it to the Lord would touch him and bring him on out of all of these times remember all these others that are sick among us how do we know that the devil doing everything he can on ever form to try to hinder us to keep us from walking on in him okay if you like turning your scriptures turn what we've been reading from Ephesians 2 and here ooze for and just let's read this and go right into the word and try to pick up where we left off Sunday but I want to try to bring this stock in tonight a little bit to you know open our eyes maybe to things that has been but also see what is taking place now the causes that's the main thing you see we're right now right okay father we thank you for this day in your grace and thank you for your love and your understanding of us thank you for you Lord and we ask you to just come among us and just be with us and bless and guide each one keep us all in your love that our hearts may be knit together in you that we may see Christ let's forgive our sins and lead us and keep us in your love let your love and understanding be in each heart because that's the main thing for all of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen remember sister Jeanne she had her hand operated on today corporal Tana love it you know what it was and talk to her a little bit ago and said she was George doing good so just keep praying for the Lord take care of all things hmm seasons 2 and verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the receding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus so the future a promise that in the future there's going to be greater things and the prophet said it right then God would give us his message of cheer down through the ages to come all right in ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus well my grace you're saved through faith that not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast okay let's go over to Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so the word is the main thing right it will divide you may be seated the Lord and His blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to pick up the point that we left off Sunday and then move on into that just a little bit and get a better understanding of where we're at we're talking about that you say by grace through faith it's a journey it's an experience the Prophet said you can be born again without having a sensation but he never I have never been able to find it if you can let me know where he ever said that you could be born again without an experience there's a lot of difference in a sensation and experience an experience is something you live through all right whereas a sensation is just a stimulation upon your your inward parts and and things and working back out into the outward part and and can be easily the devil working in many ways aren't but now because it I've tried to get it don't misunderstand me in what i'ma bring in I believe that I tried to say it are Sundy but you know by not saying a whole lot about something maybe sometimes if people who miss it well I believe in salvation as something you live through alright the disciples lived three and a half years in their experience right of the Lord Jesus with him raised in the dead healing the sick signs and wonders taking place among them and it never gave none of them the new birth they had to go to the upper room to receive Christ all right but the three thousand outside see some of them just barely heard the word things like that and they received the word and received the new birth so don't think that I'm saying that well brother Dale believes in a prolonged or a long time between each stages now it's according to your ways you're studying your thoughts that according to each one you know being different so as I remember making a statement I said it can your journey can be three minutes or it can be ten years well my point was you know it could be quie real quick I believe I believe you can come to the altar and believe all the way to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe it now what the Prophet said very few people would so I believe in that now so don't told me so well brother Dale blues this you know he don't understand it no I try to make both sides to where it'll fit your experience may be a long experience may time and all I have but to someone else it may be real quick and Feist you know to do because he you've got the house of Cornelius they had heard the word they had been studying the Bible and and studying about this coming Messiah and it everything within the Holy Ghost just fell all at once all right you got experiences like that so don't misunderstand me to think when I say that it took the disciples three and a half years that's true too right I see you don't discount that is the only thing I'm saying I don't discount them I'm believing that and you just don't discount it and make me it's something brother Dale believes you you may be twenty years seeking God you may be you maybe I told my own experience when I was two years in this message seeking the baptism of the holy ghost before I received well that was my experience what I just read I just got it this quick as I okay yeah no problem long as you got it right you know matters that said three minutes for 10 years as long as you got it that's the main thing make sure you got it and I always tell you my point is what I'd rather go through life seeking God come to the end of it find out I've always had him or to go through life and not having him and missing the whole time you said well could I do that well anointed ones and that's what we want to touch a little to not about anointed ones is a dangerous situation we'll back up on it on the justification sanctification and cover a few things to to get into that but you know I want you to think with me and then try to get the pointed I'm driving up because basically now I used the word correctly basically in brother branham's early ministry up until right into the greatest battle ever fall from right into there he begin to see things honor I say more clearer you can argue that whatever you want I can eating you at all alone I ain't gonna argue with you about it I'm just gonna say I believe it cuz I believe the Lord Jesus grows in grace and knowledge so I don't argue for nothing else and you know no problems there's no argument it's just a point all right but see we went through and we showed the difference that in his early ministry he preached basically and used it in draught illustrations and things and covered the human being as the triune being that we are and that's what you know we remember we read that the other day but first Thessalonians 5 and 22 says that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord all right I have mentioned this many times to you maybe you never heard it I ran into this before I heard her at the time maybe I was hearing the prophets message but they used to be a doctor among some of the organized religions that you didn't even have a soul until the law came into be I don't know where you've ever heard that or not but that was a doctrine they said you didn't have a soul to the law because the law brought your knowledge of sin well that sounds good and I said to her at work and listen to a man present his points you know and when it was over he said something about the soul you know and he said to me you know personally and I said well I always thought you saying that man didn't have a soul until the law came unsaid I always thought the Bible saying that he breathed into the Adams nostrils and he'd become a living soul he said I never thought of that I said well I had because that's the Bible you know let's see that's that can be man's ideas and thoughts coming in to where it'll get confusing and that's what confuses and brings us all into a position of having to fight those ideas and thoughts that we once had oh I just got rid of every time no no you don't do that that's they settle down and quit to action well if we have time we don't we'll pick it up Sunday the Prophet spoke of it in anointed ones the end of that day was three unclean spirits like frogs would go out in the last days brother Bob now we're talking about it the other night three unclean spirits like after the opening of the seals no I didn't say that that's enough no one wants them time after the opening of the seals three unclean spirits like frogs I'm looking at that now whether you're looking at or not I'm looking at it because I'm looking at seeing what's being done where people won't listen to the word and just like me is saying that what you know me trying to explain body spirit soul body folk soul spirit well why does it matter what does it matter well get baptized Lord Jesus Christ we just for Father Son Holy Ghost assistance there oh and why would it be so much to your profit will read it in a minute that he says that after the opening of the seals these things come out you never preached anointed ones until 65 he did appreciate till after the opening of the seals well see it's more serious than we think well what does it matter there so long as we get saved that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying my best and every way that I can to finding a way to get me and you to a place to be born again and they'll take care of the whole thing we won't have to worry about nothing but now being foolish to the point of this well it don't make no difference we wanted to profit preached anointed one but don't make no difference why do priests marriage and divorce I don't make no difference whitey Fritz Kreisler mr. Garner there don't mean oh dear my deep resurgence milchester when he said that when the seals broke the Bob will became a wife a brand-new book or maybe he used the word new was a four times a huge brand new she didn't does it matter well does it matter at all let's just eat drink and be merry go I'm gonna be happy about it forget it no I'm fighting for my soul and yours whether you like what I do or the way I do or not I don't bother me at all I'm just fighting for try to get the truth to you and me to where we can see it for our own sales and follow it from that line and be able to walk out of here then when we get dark ain't gonna be no argument well I try to tell you ain't gonna be no argument when we get there you know they won't we just won't get dark that'll be the main thing but now listen see in this early ministry before the opening of the seals before the word become more open to him he taught things on the basic line of what organized religion talked body-soul second trim spirit center rim I gave you them read them to you there this past Sunday all right where he made those and he made the drawing greatest battle ever fought he made the drawing we put up the drawing here to see the difference between this early ministry and the late ministry early ministry he taught I said basically cuz listen he always said the soul is the real you you always believed in that and now what are you gonna believe it or not but we we're gonna get back to the to the future home one of these days where he made the statement and he said I taught three processes from the beginning as a boy and said never changed one iota well then we say he chained here any chain here huh he didn't change is what we think each other all right see you say well what is the importance of knowing the difference between sold in spirit where are you born again is your born again experience in your body is it in your spirit it it in your soul and see you don't follow the line that I do stay there years listening to those things fighting out of the people that followed that to soul doctrine back in the seventies and all I got it with this and it's still going around the world but they cannot take from 65 on and preach their two souls you can't do it not stay in the early ministry you better remember too that the Bible has always been right Ezekiel 18 for all souls are mine the Bible says the soul that sinneth it shall die doesn't say anything about the spirit that's in it is the soul that sinneth where did brother Branham when he went beyond the curtain of time did he see spirits I'm asking you you've read the message you heard him Artie do you say he saw sold didn't you read it were and we've read it over and over to you or even the angel of the Lord referred to souls under the altar it sold under the altars under the fifth seal putting it back to beyond the curtain of time was brother Randall he said well what's the difference do you know what the new birth is how can you be born again if you don't know well I just bypass them things I did I just got no one to believe I just I just come into mansions and I know I'm right cold I believe the message could I say something I'm being too hard how can you say you believe the message then you're gonna say it don't make no difference what you're whether it's body spirit show some spirit body weight don't lean over now you tell me you I know I know that cuts and I know that hurts I know you think I'm calling you a lot of things mind if that does it to save you I'll call you that sorry I'm just to the human point that I know that if we're not walking you never worked it just took one I hear is that three unclean spirits like frogs get it in Bible they took one word one word took us out of the garden right you mean we're going back with it all messed up no we're not no that's why we're here you want to know from me why we're here we're here because we got it straightened up we still got our own ideas and thoughts where would three unclean spirits like frogs go to run said they come out of the old Trinity he said the old trinity comes from Rome you know the story right where did the old original Trinity come from from from Roman Catholics who believes in idols and son - right then it come on in to the Trinity of the Catholic Church well now what would be the new Trinity he said come out of the old Trinity that new Trinity is being you taking this word and because of our own self and interpretation in any way twisting that to make it different from what it is there's a new Trinity now you think I ain't looking at it look at all these across the land it's left a message could that be the new Trinity cuz what would it be well brother Browns right on sometimes but he ain't right on everything well no you know what if you can correct brother Brandon come on if you can correct brother branham take off your shoe and walk down here I want to kiss your toe now you know what that means don't see that means the Pope the Pope ain't that far all he's against the message we ain't that far off code you don't know how to be that far off three unclean spirits like frogs frogs look backward what was the thing the Prophet said our problem would looking backward looking forward I'm not seeing one snail I'm sorry I'm sorry for trying to tell you the truth no I don't care about that part because I believe we're gonna get out of here all right and he's gonna take the full word all right now are you with me and what I'm talking about we gave you the quotes no you still got the same notes all right we gave you the quotes so one and 61-62 and on through there there what's your profit talk go ahead number two we'll read these we'll put it right back out read it again just the same way we've read it because I believe it all right this is from the message called the inside 1962 119 okay man is made up as a triune being so body spirit now the outside is the body there's five gates to that body and that's the five senses of course CJ's filled smells in here inside like the seed that's planted I'm about a plan of a natural seed penny bean corn the inside of that seed is a puff like of the seed which is the sole there is five gates to that you enter into its conscious memory and so forth within inside of that little compart little that little compartment is the third compartment which is the spirit okay there's only one Avenue through that and that self we'll all right then so he's teaching body by senses second room five senses memory reason conscious calling it the soul yeah and then he's showing you the compartment in the middle which has only one sense either faith or doubt he calls that spirit he draws out the little circles were safe down to reading him but he draws out the little circles on blasphemous names and he gave those little circles and told I gave you from the message the in sign and gave you from the message the revelation of Jesus Christ 1961 0 101 gave you a paradox 1962 1228 so you made up a soul body and spirit the outside which is the body is controlled by five senses you enter the body by the five senses see taste feel smelling here and inside the body is a soul and that soul has five cents five cents gates and so forth memory reasons but inside of that is a spirit and that's what controls it okay so there no problem but now you that was here Sunday or have heard the message remember one thing for sure I'm not trying to correct brother branham because I told you 40 years ago I was teaching this same thing or more that's brother Colley he said I've got even some of the notes inside you know his way of talking I've always taught it because what are you gonna do it you got brother branham that looks like he goes this away then he looks like he goes that way but he was right when he was teaching body soul and spirit because he gave the five senses he always gave the five senses to the body the five senses is the second dream five and one scent start to as he called it which is either faith or doubt one sense to the inner man he always talked to him he talked that in the beginning he taught it after the opening of the season amazing how God can keep him so correct when I'm telling you you didn't gonna like this statement but evidently he didn't have it lined up straight because he had it back in his early ministry did he followed that line but then when he come over in the opening of the word which was the anointed ones that's the basics when he started 1965 11:25 1965 did he started on anointed ones and he starts explaining the end of body spirit and so what now on anointed ones that was the key I tried to get you to see Sunday anointed ones where is the anointing at on an anointed one the Prophet said is in your spirit so then if he hadn't brought that if the Lord in other words plain language whether you like it's what do God had to open the eyes of the profit on anointed ones now if you don't believe me read the book no let me read it let me just read it okay and see what he said let's see if this is important when he comes to the anointed ones in 1965 7:25 he says and seeing all this accumulation of evidence that the hour that work that we now live in I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and draw them out since this fields has been opened and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal with us with His grace to show us these things I want you to notice here in Matthew 24 Jesus used the term Christ sees our ist as Christ not Christ not singular but Christ plural not singular Christ alright anointed coming down that was paragraph 22 23 24 paragraph 44 anointed wants the end time but you see he sends a rain back to our subject on the just and the unjust Jesus tells you here in Matthew 24 it would be a sign at the end time what would be a sign at the end time he just told you up here Matthew 24 covers Christ it's right across many now if this sign is only to be known at the end time it'll have to be after the opening of those seals see it's a son well they got it up here it's the sign of the end that would be when these things happen it'll be at the end time and it'll be a sign and so the election will not be confused in these things then it's got to be revealed why do we need to know the difference between body spirit and soul are you nobody sold spirit or anointed ones I remember this because he does not cover on anointed ones he does not make the statement now you read it bring it to me he makes the statement but you got itself interpreted he does not say the anointing is on your spirit well the only once in time he does not use that terms then he uses later on in his message as come on folks I forget I've been in this 40 years so don't worry about it our faith preachers standing and saying hey no y'all are saying because you can quote brother Branham back then we only had one or two books and you quote that anointing is on your spirit well he only said it on that one time on our own so it's not in northern ones the in time it's not he preaches it because he preaches the Christ but he doesn't say the anointing is just on your spirit he just says on anointed one that you can be baptized with a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit and still be lost he doesn't put the basis and were sacked now remember the dates that was 11:25 1120 used me it's your got it right it's 11 2011 excuse me 65 725 is when the Illinois was free northern ones all right now he preaches in the evening that's the morning he preaches in the evening the only ones he goes to the next wins next wins tea and excuse me priestess Christ is revealed in his own word then he preaches thinking man's builder and knoweth it not trying to do God a service rapture things that are to be power to transform and leadership each one of them he brings out and preaches body spirit and so what are you gonna do with anointed ones are you anointed on your spirit are you anointed on your soul which one is it what does it matter because you don't know whether you're born again or not come on you don't know whether you're born again or not because were you born again at if we are to be born again in our soul we need to get it in the soul if we're gonna be born again in our spirit we need to get in the spirit we're gonna be born again in our body we'd never get it in the body right is that sensible you see that's where when the Prophet when it opened when it opened he had draw those three reigns on blasphemy on the greatest battle ever fought in 62 he comes back in 65 and draws him Satan realms and says body spirit and so he said in C you can be anointed on your spirit and still be lost do you believe that you believe you can actually be on those times we didn't get to read these other day but let's read some of it okay let's go to number five and knoweth it not now here's what happens now watch this just a little figurative picture here what that's that's greatest battle ever fought I don't want to come on it come to the next message and North it not brother Brandon shows his drawing of the three range this is 65 after 91 was preached the date the only ones was preached on 725 815 okay come on and what does he say it's what we look at what we see it has five inlets to that body in any grammar school child as myself would know that there's five senses to the body see taste feels militant here you can't touch the body it's the only way you can have through the body see taste feel smell in here all right that for the evil one works on the outside now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life is breathed into you that spirit is of a world in nature because it was not given from God but was given and watch him permitted in other words it wasn't made of God to be wrong right is that what he's saying it wasn't made to be wrong oh I didn't make it wrong he permitted it to come into a worldly nature he didn't make it wrong you can't have God making your soul spirit or body whatever wrong and then condemn you you can't do that it wouldn't be a just God so watch what he's saying but it was given permitted now you got that and every child that's born in the world is born in sin sin and iniquity come to world speaking lies right that person inside dark is a sinner to begin with then you got five inlets and then five will inlets he said first I know it's tall conscious love choice no conscious memory there is the five inlets to the spirit now listen to it you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all what I feel I can see that's where people I don't he don't know how to explain it it was he literate I never heard of nobody would a college degree that ever defeated his terminologies do you it may sound like it wasn't too good but if you listen to it it'll tell you the truth so you can't think with the body you have to think with your spirit you can't how conscious and in your body is there's no mental faculties all your body does so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being reason doesn't see touch feel smell hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there is five senses that controls that inside man and that now to the last man which is the soul there is only one sense that controlled that and that is free moral agency to a right to choose in other words so what's he explaining now body spirit and soul now you can understand it when we get to these other words down here that you'll find out where it comes from all right that's going over what was that one let's go to number six rocks revealing his own word lie Sunday which was a days preaching on only once in time when we was going into those cycles about that the five senses on the outer rim that's the inlet five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's about five senses CJ's feel smell in here there's no other way to contact the body when the inside of that man is a man called spirit and he has five senses think thought thought love and conscious and so forth now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and there is worth to many of Christians only stop and they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit that the real believer is anointed with but down on the inside of that next room third rim so where's the anointing second rim now listen he was listening to one ago when they first started back in the seventies and the things about the anointed ones in sight we didn't have no quotes to argue with him with the people we had ministers meetings we didn't have no quotes to argue because the books were not out we didn't have the ability I remember when some started appearing that you could start saying hey wait a minute he's talking about the spirit go you tell a lot of you tell the to slow people LaRon was talking about anointing on his fear no he said so he's an Engel listen to you what are we gonna do and then on the inside of that next room the third room is a soul and that's the predestinated that's where the real seed germinates okay go ahead to the next one there's more of that legacy in church 8 which is he's reading from that but he still own the crisis revealing his own work no see see the Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his journey the anointing can fall in your spirit but the soul is the journey that germ is the word come on I don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets to spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets you don't love with your body you display it that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out Devils and preach and do these things still not be right you just said so said many would come in that day okay go ahead what's the next number sick number I thinking man's filter come on up now as I spoke this morning and life Sunday morning on that wheel in the middle of the wheel or that little inside sole on the inside of the spirit how does the spirit Canon now that the spirit on the outside between the soul in the body can be absolutely anointed with the holy ghost did you understand that what of that with this continuity the message god of this world anointed ones in the last days and inside that middle circle first circle is the human senses second circle now he's coming outside going inward second sir I mean in we're coming out the second circle is the spirit sentences self will desire so forth but the inside is the soul that so was predestinated so they can annoy this spirit to make the outside body come into subjection to the spirit with the soul that sinneth that's social not in the soul that rejects in unbelief the Word of God which is a part of that soul no words why is it gonna be run it up he can get down to the bottom she might sing in the choir she might dance in this period she might speak in tongues and have all the manifestations of the spirit but unless that soul on the inside is God's daughter see she's gone now what is it if it's not done come on what's the next no trying to do go to service see how the Holy Spirit can a known a man but it's got to be listen in the order of the anointing listen the outside spirit can be anointed with the holy spirit and the soul as dark his pitch now you know for certain which one he's talking about don't you the Spirit is worthy of mourning falls those the soul is either white or black it's one of the two you got to cook a burger think what the soul is of it is cocklebur the false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can continuum number nine the rapture you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't mean that you're saved not by a long ways the year you're a try on being you're inside this little fella here is the soul now what's you in a minute the next is the spirit the next is the body you got five senses in this body to continue to act your earthly home they don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the Spirit low conscious and so forth but in here is where you live that's what you are or let's all right sure well what is it one of them will bar a cocoa butter cuz that's all ahead the cocklebur will raise up okay go ahead things that are to be there are three people of you the outside is the body you got five senses that you contact the earthly home with the inside is the spirit there's five senses darl of in conscious so for you but the inside of that is the soul keep on going what number which we hold on the number eleven okay which is the power of transformation that little inside of the inside that's where you start which is your soul can you come from that your spirit then you become a living being and a living being that five senses to conduct the second has five senses that's the outside body see touch feel smell in here the inside body had love conscious and so forth but the inside of the inside the control tower is either God or Satan though the soul is either God or Satan whatever we want to make it okay next is leadership look here on the outside person you've got five senses they can't run that guy outside he had five senses contact with earthly home then you know were spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets conscience and love and so forth five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts of physical spiritual contacts are spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that gene that come from God okay works is faith Express now remember you're in a cycle of the three which you're one person like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of three the one person three attributes to the same God fatherhood the Three Olives is like fatherhood sons you all ago and you are body spirit and soul outside of the body has five endless to contact your earthly home see taste feel smelling hear the inside which is a spirit it has five senses conscious and love is over but the inside of that the soul has one thing that's where you live the spirit come and watch now the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved where's it an anointing you that in your spirit think of me that cough let's promise that Judas casts out Devils the spirit anointed in this rain falls when adjusting the unjust the weeds can rejoice with the wheat which is what's that that core there's where you can intellectuals can accept and say oh sure that looks good I believe that I still that still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so because that soul hasn't come from God come on it can make all the impersonations out there but it cannot be real you can actively you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians in action be so good at it but that don't mean you're saved that's exactly right and the spirit can be the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you and that spirit still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies it's got eternal life it's the soul when we got what number 1 12 13 14 I like to say things this way right in the middle of all of it you wondered what and wherever you come about I'm gonna say this you think I'm leaving out some of the things brother I don't say it I invite you to come and show me I've had these 40 years I ain't worrying that don't you think in any way that I ever leave anything out I try to prove a doctrine if you do you need to leave finds you another pastor if that's what you think your pastor does I'll help you find every quote you want that will even look like you to disprove me because I know for certain and ain't gonna do it he's never done it so far I'm not talking like this rocks revealed in his own word that doctor one we done read I think Christ revealed they don't work Oh 23 yeah okay let's just put it out here and leave it right there now I believe the bread around him was a prophet born the Prophet but I do not believe he understood everything if he did then he lied when he said he did so that's a up to you to believe what you won't do about it that I'm not determining that that's nothing to me I've tried my best to search this message knowing that not only was my soul involved my family was involved and his church was involved and I've tried to study it to try to bring it out don't worry that you could make a choice you don't understand what I'm talking about when I say those two so people would rattle that message off but they always talked about your soul is just the nature of your spirit there is not a quote of that in the message find it for me he did not brother I've never said the soul is just the nature of the sphere he said the soul is the nature of the spirit they added to word just to it because that would just be enough to twist it he'll make it to word it really didn't mean nothing where is the new birth or does it type lies and what about it here comes a prophet to correct all errors he corrected those two so people and they never knew it they still won't have it say well whatever what are you talking about you could be anointed on your spirit we just read it do genuine things and still be lost they show me where he ever said you could be anointed on your soul that the soul is the real you the inner part of you the body five senses see taste feel smell in here the second realm of mankind whether you call it solar call experience is memory reason conscience etc the five senses but the soul has one sense and brother branham went beyond the curtain of time the angel of the Lord reading if you don't believe it Brian come to me I'll be glad to read it to you the angel of the Lord referred it said sold under the altar he saw real people he didn't see no spirits running around he saw real people in their soul which is their theophany come on he's one that said it was theophany he saw him dark and he said this that was the soul of man we're missing the whole thing by our own thoughts of taking what we believe about something instead of listening and ours where we'll end and say it that's where your three unclean spirits like frogs after the opening of the seals and that's what's your prophet say it after the opening of the seals you would have three unclean spirits like frogs age b-26 anointed wants the endtime paragraph 143 no notice the Trinity the Dragon him any knows what the dragon was it was wrong the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born that right what does beast mean in the Bible power false prophets false prophet a false prophet a false anointed ones he started were this is false prophet singular because that's what it is you've got you you've got your order you got your Antichrist false prophet incarnate false prophet and beast that's your seal that's your for combat beast and the for to combat it alright so listen to what he's saying this is a false prophet singular false prophet Pope and there come up the and the mother of harlots the whole thing a false trinity was rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days now when was the Trinity way back before the Prophet right so listen to it it right right on through it and when the seven seals become and open those mysteries and reveal them that's when the frogs three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a Trinity doctrine against the to truth see where it come from words it going back to ecumenical council they're all brothers in the house same spirit same thing what so performing miracles these are Devils so forth to all the gods of the earth working miracles to deceive them in the last days and we'll succeed in doing that what after the seals broke so that's all I say to you you can say what you want to about the statements I've made the only statement I'm making you're gonna just have to look at it and believe what you won't do those three unclean spirits like frogs come out after the opening of the seals okay that's what he said got no argument all right they come out after the opening of the seals or are they now there right now deceiving the people of this message taking them straight to niceö Rome oh no they ain't taking us to Rome you don't have to go to Rome to be a Roman you don't have to kiss the Pope's to do PO to be a Catholic they asked the Pope but it's that time what about so that some of them because they think on our doctrine does not the world system how the same doctrine of the Catholic Church the Trinity but what about the people of this message over brother Dale they're not Trinitarian what are they they're tearing this message apart don't ever hand go on click it on the internet and see them in preach this message 4050 years and see what they're preaching now we were talking about this the other night at Terrance's I have never in my life been for afraid because I believe the prophets message didn't believe it's gonna take place but I'm looking right now at the worst deceptive point that and I've been at it for about a year or now or more of knowing the people of this message was turning so much against the message and I taught this in the 70s whether you believe it or not I taught in the seventies that it would not be the denomination's that would destroy us it would be right from among us I talked that in the seventies and and still believe it today you've got no problem with a Trinitarian concept of a doctrine with three unclean spirits like frogs come out from bat Dyer and brought in that Trinity and when the Prophet went off the scene an opening the seals what happened here's three unclean spirits like frogs coming back doing the same thing destroying this message what are we doing about it I've told you over and over in the 70s we had doctrines and questions and we had ministers meetings about brother Branham on his dates being wrong out in Colorado Arizona it's a day sometimes we had ministers meetings on that in the seventies talking about it but you know what the difference was you had the old people that listened and the old people said I don't give a hoot what day he was hunting because I remember telling them in the ministers meeting I said you've got bunch of gods think you've got something about her I said they changed into laws every day I said I'm a deer hunter I said they change the law I said I can just buy click of a pen put on another week of hunting I said I don't care but you see the older people withstood it and fought it and those young people that was coming in trying to produce and a lot of the oh the doctrinal issues wound up to be the old people of the message and when they did the old people that's turned against the message you said talk like that is it the truth are you going to be deceived by a bunch of illegitimate children of this message that are the old people of the message the biggest force of the whole people about dying off you're leaving it for the young ones they got nothing wrong with the young one if they'll stay with the truth they got her place as I've told you that it was up in Jeffersonville first time I'd went was 68 we was up there to the old was the guard buildings and things up there in that place and they were having a meeting you know I went one way brother bolt went the other way night awhile I come back around through there and I was just dying laughs and he said what is wrong you alive and I said well I said I went over here to these group of old men and they was all saying that you had to see brother Branham you had to know his moves his actions to understand what he's preaching and you had to see and if you didn't see it then you messed up and said and they were saying and these young people that are over here said them young people is like them it was 20 years and under said they didn't see Moses like we did I said I left that group and I went over to the other side got over here now with the young people you know what young people said them old people never crossed over the land and it doesn't go any Bibles tell you the old people didn't go across they got in the wilderness those it was 20 years of age and younger were the ones that went in to the promised land I said I don't know which one to join you know which group should I be in you see I see it more today you see the people with this message just drawing the message my brother Dale you're one of them come on I've always been this way if I ever tell you you're gone you better believe I've got my ducks in a row ain't gonna tell you you're wrong if I don't know and can't prove it this what I don't believe brother Dale called he just he just arrogant hateful what does that got to do with the truth can I end this with another one Church listen it's serious you realize if that genuine anointing is the genuine anointing that's on the false prophets and that is the genuine anointing that your prophet said it was you realize to make fun of that is to make fun of the Holy Ghost oh no that's no come on I didn't say it your prophet said it he said that is the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost anointing them anointed one just like it did Moses just like it did to all the others don't make fun of all these people leave them alone you see yeah but your car I've got a warning I'm faster right I'm the one who's got to do the hollering to warn you how you gonna know whether those two sold or not if you ain't never heard the truth if you're not born again how are you gonna know what a new Berkeley you see one serious don't make light of nobody more bless God I ain't fooling one of them that bunch don't make light of nobody I don't believe you caught what I said so I'm gonna say it one more time if you make fun of the anointing of the Holy Ghost and that is the genuine anointing it don't matter if the person that it's anointing of it's false you're making fun of the Holy Ghost don't do that let's have a fear and reverence to the baptism of the Holy Ghost is you gonna at least protect that and guard against God you know being tackled in ways as to what people are doing it there they don't make no difference they don't make no difference we're all in bad shape come on music you said War illness there's another message on it of what do you know which is correct because we don't know about it how are you gonna know how to be born again I've asked you to read the future home read it over and over where brother Branham says that that repentance he said has nothing to do with your nature but that's what everybody says my nature changed my whole being changed I come to the altar and I cried and I shouted you know in heaven help I'm not making fun I'm telling you what people say and you come to sanctification that's the most dangerous stage of anywhere in your Christian journey because you think because it's you quit you're smoking you're drinking you're lying you're cheating you're adulterous acts and your things you think because you quit all that that means you're saved remember until we get back to it they're not born again in your body I see taste feel smelling hear you're not born again in the second trim of memory reason and conscience affections you're not born again in that those were Satan can play with you to tell you who you are come on he used to tell you now listen I'll find this quote but it's in there that's all right I'll make it for myself don't worry about it he used to tell us that we were lost now he tells you that you're saved same devil same lie you still don't understand within maybe we need to get on Nicodemus and stay there for about six months on how that man so smart as he was and all of his doings and everything he couldn't understand a simple thing that you must be born again he couldn't understand what that was don't worry about it go see there's one thing for sure that I know you know that I know I can't preach era are true enough to get somebody unsaved that is saved okay is that Alright I know that I can't get you unsaved if you are saved so then I'm not worried I know where I stand on that what do we got 29th day thank only site a crown being 3 29 the world will try to Society [Music]
