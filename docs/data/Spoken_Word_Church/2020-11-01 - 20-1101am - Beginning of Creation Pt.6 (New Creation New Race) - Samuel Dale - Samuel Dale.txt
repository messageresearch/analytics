not on okay got you and everything so we we appreciate that we appreciate all of the prayers the the things that people have done while we were sick and kind of out of order and you know having to make do for the time because it was vagavating time that you know never been that way in my life i've never been weak and run down or anything i've always just been strong and ready to go but it'll tell you it'll do it he'll hit you he hits you just right but that's all right we know god will take care of everything he's one that handles all of it i appreciate everybody i'll see you i appreciate you [Applause] because you're you're laying there in a hospital room and we've all laughed about it they put me in the smallest room they had in the biggest guy you know and i couldn't walk the furthest i could walk was near brother louise there at all and they wouldn't let me walk that but uh the thing of it was they had me in this room and it was fixed up to filter out i reckon all of the things and this great big pipe ran through the floor and ran up and this machine was running and i don't know what in the world they was doing but uh you know then you you you get a phone call and and you think a phone call don't mean nothing but when you're stuck in a place that you don't know where in the world you at and what's going on a little phone call is a great thing so you know thank god for all of that and all that they had trouble trying to find me in the hospital but that's all right they moved me about and done it they took care of me i'll just put it that way but i appreciate your prayers is the main thing you're praying every day and holding me up okay if you like turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading for quite a while and we'll just pick up right where we left off and let's go to revelations 3 14 and then we'll go to john 1. uh i guess if bob's sick you gonna take wednesday or what just leave it that way i guess okay we'll leave it on that basis okay that uh but i hope you you keep in mind all of these things of the announcements that terrence has made and we'll make them over and over and over because we're trying to get a place you know and to do where we can all be together and in this building we can all be together and we can have ten by ten square foots left over you know we can we can fellowship together okay but we'll have a good time in the lord and unto the angel of the church of the lady of sian's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god all right let's go to john and in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth father we thank you for this day and opportunity to be able to come together to fellowship together in you and we pray that you would just bless us now and guide us give us lord of your love and understanding may we walk in the light of the lord in jesus name amen you may be seated i had a long time to you know to meditate and think on a lot of things and church i believe that you and i are right on the threshold i told you when all this started with the virus that it was not the end it was the beginning of the end it was just starting the phases coming down but we are coming now all of this election time to all of these things that's none of my business who gets the president it ain't going to change one thing i don't care if they make every one of them president give them 50 more of them or whatever it ain't going to change nothing because we're here at the end of all things and being at the end of it then let's rejoice in that because we know see we know that we're at the end we know that we're that we can't continue this situation of existence for a long period of time it can't be done so we know that things will have to take place and whatever but just remember one thing god is in command he's taking care of it don't worry about it you say well well i don't understand all of this brother dale why like wade was bringing out about the uh you know people that are sick are the people that are christians a lot of times and the others are doing better well you know don't worry about it i thought that we believed that there was nothing put on us that god didn't allow it to happen i mean that's my understanding now that's not talking about a daily little coal or sniffles that's part of it too yeah but the main thing are large things coming on people that are believers you say well why well he's putting them there to test me and you [Music] he's putting it there to test us he said brother and said she'd this bride would prove to satan that she wouldn't fall like eve so then whatever it is bring it on let's get on with it and get everything under way and just rest in christ and say thank you lord and things starts going wrong you just pray and come together and pray and fellowship together around the word and and let it all wind up finish out because it will and and we're on the thresholds of those things how long who's worried i'm not concerned about how long or what's going on i'm concerned with the fact of what you and i are doing with what god is allowing to happen now that's my point what are we doing with what god allows do you agree that he has to allow these things he couldn't get onto job until god turned him loose satan can't do it he can't do those things all right but see to think that if my name is called in heaven i think that's a great thing don't you but what if your name is called in heaven and it comes forth that you're an overcomer what a great thing okay let's just keep those things in mind and just think about it that we're here to end and as it finishes everything up then we are the people that the ends of the world has come upon them that's what the bible says all right so let's rejoice in where we're at and what's taking place we don't rejoice in bad sicknesses and not all like that no but we rejoice when we're healed and brought out of it it's a wonderful thing amen okay all right now when i back when we started with all of this and i kind of backed off and let the brothers start ministering and i certainly appreciate them they have done a marvelous job taking over and and bringing the word to us and i appreciate it because they're they're doing great uh i'm i'm i'm thrilled at watching them because i like to watch uh young people come up and move on i like to see you gain ground and and do things but i like to see you gain ground on your own [Music] that's the one thing is gang ground on your own helping people is great but to worship god and just move on in our own okay uh we were in the beginning of the creation that was our title and thoughts back there and we'll continue on to think about these things because remember the point that i was trying to bring out then and i've listened two or three times to the same message to make sure and try to follow it is the the beginning of the creation that god so placed it before us till it's a marvelous thing we we go to christ the mystery and we talk about how that all god was he was in christ all christ in the church take her back to the garden of eden et cetera and all like that we see those things but my point was to try to get you to think about the creation all right and in that thinking about it we talked about it in three stages we talked about it as stage one that god comes into being in a stage that was would be counted as from uh how would you say it brother random will say he said there was nothing back there all right and he'd emphasize there's nothing back there then in a minute he'd say with the great eternal god well see there was never a time never has been a time there's there should be no thoughts in anybody's human mind to think that there was a time that god didn't exist because who would bring what into being if he was not there and to be able to bring us we wouldn't have got a year but we ought to think about that that he was he so marvelously i sat down and i really cry about it because to think that god would reveal to a group of people his very plan and purpose you're you're a part of that plan and purpose you're a part of it that's that's what it is it's not something that he thanks up along the way he knew it from the beginning all right and see in that then he's the beginning of the creation back there right remember put it in three stages put it back before the foundation of the world or whatever then we brought it in to jesus christ coming on earth into human flesh into a body to live and then to bring it to the bride of christ to bring it into the finishing up of the creation as it would be now remember we talked about new creation just as a minute to make sure our thoughts is running right when you use new in the bible terminologies it's not necessarily meaning something new especially it does not reference to something different it does not reference to something that was here in here you know it's to me it's it's just a point of uh seeing how that god could come into being all right now i said we hold it to the three stages because see he's still coming into being ever born again believer ever born again believer coming into the body of christ you realize that makes you a part of god you say no no no no well what does it make you it makes you a part of god that inner being that soul that part of you that god is working on and as he does he brings it into being and showing us that he had a beginning not he had that he didn't exist there's nothing nothing and all it wants something no it's just the fact of one thing i i wrote this down where i emphasize it beginning or new in other words is a starting point sure because that's the emphasis new you know starting or whatever but it's really starting the fact of how that god can come into being we can see how a tree plant a seed poetry that comes into being we can see how the all of the things of the world of life can come into being but do we ever think about that god coming into being not coming into being that he was non-existent not the fact that he was not there in his fullness because he was god in the beginning he'll always be god so you can't make it anything else all right but see to think about it then it just means there's something going to come into view and god is going to unveil himself and reveal himself and see then that's why i say that when we come to the third stage of it we get to that stage of seeing that christ is the mystery of god revealed he's in his bride and that comes forth into that perfect time but thinking about it how that we see him come into being back there or unveil himself and as the bible says as we was reading there the only begotten he has made him known all right see then we think about well was there a time that god didn't exist see those things are are uh uh really of none at use to me i don't want to call it a lot of crazy words but that's of non-existent things because uh who would ever think about a time that they wasn't a god then who started what see no you can't do that but to think about that that god would think so much of his people that he would come down condescend whatever the words you want to use move down into a realm that human mortals can have a little idea about god you know just a little idea about him because that's all we're getting when we get out of this world there'll be wonderful marvelous this is the way i see it because i believe we're just making we're just getting ready here to be able when we get there to be able to understand what's going on all right and he'll express all of those things and you and i will be there and we'll have a wonderful time fellowshipping together around the word that we heard and say do you remember i i remember sitting there that day and all at once it just come over me and god just began to reveal himself and open his word and begin to to bring it out to where i could see you say well that was wonderful because see we'll have a wonderful time to do all right but talking about how that god comes into being stage one of the three stages of the beginning of the creation and that's why we're using it that way because see in revelations 3 14 is to this age that's this age right and this age is the age to get the revelation of all to bring it all into being that we can see it and we can see how that god is coming forth and how he begin to condescend and as he was condescending he would have to open the eyes of mankind to be able to see so it begins sometimes in baby form i know i would say in all times in baby form because it begins in the basis of little bitty things that we can follow well you know that's why that uh you know maybe maybe i look at it in a funny way but you know to explain something in baby form you know i mean it really it means you explain it where the baby can understand that's first off do you realize what if what if you don't ever think like that what if god had not sent a prophet of the caliber ever how you say that caliber every style of manner that he is what if he sent a theologian what if he'd have revealed him and i ain't saying it he doesn't reveal himself to the theologians no no no we're not talking about that i'm talking about god's promise in the word to send us a prophet to restore the word all right now we're not talking about degrading nobody for how much education or whatever we're talking about the simple thoughts of understanding that you realize when a prophet explains something he makes it so simple how many of you remember the first time that you heard him say well you know there's not three gods there's just one god well we baptist said that you know we understood those things but he says he said he he's not in three persons but said it's like a father he said i'm a father and i have children a son and said you know i'm a human being well here sets a a group of people in a church i'm not throwing no slangs i'm talking all right coming from back in the old pentecostals move and things coming through that some of you can well remember that you know it was a hard times and tight times and different things of going and all but yet god was there and you know simple people could understand i was listening we were like not too of random talking you know i know this happened with a brother that he he pronounced some words and said some things one time about something and the the law got after him and maybe some of you heard that you know and as they did because he was they was using words you know that were were not shouldn't be used i guess but you know what that prophet would just talk and he could talk in a language that everybody can understand now this is my idea of education here's my idea of an education an education is the basis of being able to know and communicate i mean what good does it do for god to give brother louise a great mastermind of all of the things that he could explain the wheel than where it came from or something what good is that if i don't understand what he's talking about i don't know what a wheel is i don't know what to tell you but he can take it and break it down and say this and this and and put it to a basis if he can then he's the educated person the educated person is the person that can get across what he's talking about okay do you understand it that way an educated person to me is a person who can get across what he's talking about if i can't get it across what good is it for it to be education you know i've tried to explain things to people and i did we were thinking about a brother the other day and i loved him so much and uh but we were talking about the seals and and uh i said something about one of the seals and how it fits in this way that away and he said brother he said i don't understand he said i'm not saying you're wrong he said you're right i guess he said but i just don't have the ability to understand what you're talking about well you know what i never did go off and throw a grapefruit i went to a brother the other day told him something he told me he couldn't understand what i'm talking about and all that broke my heart that i didn't make it simple enough that i didn't break it down enough maybe for him to understand but i thought more of him because he was willing to admit where 99.99 of the ministers i'll set that away and not throw no stone wouldn't even listen long enough for you to try to explain the things you know try to express it and i began to try to find a more simpler way of expressing what i was talking about and i think it worked and you know has finally come to the basis that we can see that we're talking about the one true and living god the entire bible the entire message everything is talking about god revealing himself to his people and to sit down and be able to read a book or or listen to a prophet or read the bible and be able to think about it and think about that hey i can understand that you know i can comprehend what's being said and see then that way if i can comprehend it then i'm part of it you ever thought about it like that of your own self that you're a part of it because only by being a part of it we'd be able to comprehend but it'll never be the great theological terminologies of life to understand the word because it'll never work right they have to be used or there brother branham used them i mean brother brown would talk about a theophany a logos and he he thought it theopopey or some you know he couldn't even pronounce the words of what he were doing but you remember what he said he said when i have trouble trying to understand these things what did he say he said i go look it up well see a great theologian a great you know intellectual per i know what that means cat means cat and we just leave it to that what are you trying to do you know you know but a a simple-minded person and if you'll think about the bible and i'd invite you to go all the way through why is it in the bible you have let's see you have moses and paul right too highly educational type of form right the rest of the bible is not that away no one could compare with paul on his understanding we take the communion without even thinking about it but to think that the the communion was passed down to the disciples and they were there when it was the first time and and all of these things but yet when it was all finished paul was chosen to explain the communion why because he had all of that background he knew all the things that like wade brought out how that there's certain plates left there's certain things left paul knew every bit of that and he could put it into simple terms people think paul is a deep part no he's very simple he makes it so simple until really the the the educated fall over in the simplicity now the point i'm i'm trying to get it is can we see the condescending of god that as he comes into view as he's coming down through that frame of whatever you call it the existence of whatever that were that he was there as self-existing and we can think about him as being self-existing well see that may be hard to think about but you know this is what makes it easier for me to understand he was self-existing because he knew the people that he was going to exist with right would be very simple-minded and would require him to bring it in simplicity so he does this and he says that'll that'll make that plain to them they can understand the godhead because i'll put this here and all down through time all the prophets will be trying to explain this thing that the theologians can't see and they think it's a trinity or something and that but they can't see it in there and he said here's a man makes it so simple until everybody can follow him and said the major of it all to bring the last in the end time because i think that that's what i think about brother branham i think that he was the most educated man that has ever been no that sounds funny don't i yeah no but i think he was the most he wasn't illiterate see he wasn't in ever in any form of those but he was to the form that he would put everything so simple the greatest teacher that i've ever heard sit down and teach children he said okay now today said we're going to talk to the children you know teach children his word and they can understand him that to me is a great masterpiece of an understanding is to think that then in this last days we would receive the word of god to where it would be so plain unto us until the children would understand what does that say about the fool shall not air therein you know because i can't but do you see it i mean you're thinking about those things and you think how that he begin to unveil himself and if we'd have been back there we could have got a better understanding but he knew we weren't going to be there he knew we were going to be right where we're at this is the age of understanding this is the age of the the bringing forth of god in his word all right and it's so marvelous to see that looking back there and you see him coming forth he you can't see him and then we get into the scriptures and see the the scripture used to throw me uh god is a spirit and they that works very much worshipping in spirit and truth well i mean i that was wonderful i was that was okay i could follow and comprehend the point of that but when coming to find out that you can't see a spirit right you can't see a spirit so he's coming from something that cannot be seen in that form now follow me that way he could never be understood because it's a spirit and he he still remains that till this day he's still the spirit everything is still the same but yet he's he could express himself till he could move over into another form and then another form in another form and as it is he gradually unveils himself and as he unveiled himself the first thing he does is revealed himself right and see we look at those wordings but that's what i've been trying to get you to see and and i've got this very almost i know they're the same notes but uh diff little order are different but uh of back when i was trying to bring forth this in a way so go ahead let's let's go get a few and then we'll uh we'll take it up later because i want you to see this i want you to see not only see everything in the bible is basically in threes right it's laid out that way and if we follow it in that way then stage one is your your your foundational right and then see you move them into stage two and it's more realistic because you come into jesus being in human flesh all right well see what about when it's coming to the point of him being revealed in you right now right now right now not not you know and brought with that go ahead number number one there brother because i want you to think about these things because that used to bother me when it says god is a spirit well i'd say okay how we're going to ever understand the spirit you know because you can't see it feel it hear it smell it you can't do none of that with a spirit and you realize god is still that but yet he so masterfully has unveiled himself until he can sit right beside of you and you can recognize his presence you know he can walk with you he can can talk to you and you'll recognize it look what he says all for questions and answers no man has seen the father at any time now what you look how marvelous a man is explaining how simple no man can see god in the bodily form now he never said nobody can see god or understand god or comprehend this or but what is the form that you can't understand him what is the form that you can't understand him see no man can see god in the bodily form why simple answer because god is not in body form simple answer somebody says well well you know how can we do that it can't be done all right not in a bodily form god is a spirit all right and no man has seen the father now here we go but the only begotten of the father hath declared him see all right look what he's saying but notice now there's nothing there there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it's it's just seems nothing now watch him but in there is a straight supernatural being now remember in the prophet explaining a supernatural being or any form of talking about it being to him it's a real it's real uh any and get that from me because that's what i i believe see if it can come from forth from non-existence of understanding to an existence of understanding it becomes a being it becomes something that can comprehend and talk with us in fellowship what i like is where a prophet would explain like he said uh that he made man he said then when he said when he made man made animal made this way he said when he made the and man he said he saw that adam was lonely right you remember that he said adam was lonely he said you know why because he was lonely see he had nothing to exist with him he was lonely that's wonderful to me a man a great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space of all places at all times he was from everlasting from everlasting he's the beginning of creation all right now i like that because he breaks it down instead of the beginning of the creation of god he's the beginning of the creation god is going to be made manifest he said that's god can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an atom in the air not nothing not no air no nothing but yet god was there that was god now watch them for a few minutes and all no man has seen that now that's the father that's god the father see nobody has seen that you can't see it it's a spirit he's still a spirit my father is a spirit i don't have any trouble with with you know saying talking to my father as a spirit like like one i remember anton one day he said y'all crazy people said you you uh asked god a petition for healing and said you asked it in the name of the father and said in the minutes you put in there in the name of the son and said when you get the holy ghost in said you got all three trying to deal on one thing i said no that ain't the way it's dealing it's it's what i can talk to him in spirit form can't you compreh can't you uh communicate with god without having to talk yes that's right you will have to admit this i believe it's true the biggest portion of my prayers are silent prayers and i would not never in any way tell you to be that away because it's not it's just a part of me i'm just like that it's just something personal i don't have to go in a closet and i'm not throwing nothing i don't have to get before a picture i don't have to do anything i can be working at general motors i could just be putting motors in where i'd have to grab that hook and sling it in there and jerk that motor up and what eight 900 pounds sling that thing around with my own body sling it over in the frame and god help me and we'd set it down you know i could just be talking to god and saying thank you thank you for what you've let now be made known today and i've always said this i never go to church and i don't get something that's right i don't because i'll get something if there's nothing else then thank you lord for everything because that's the way we ought to be we're to thank him for everything in the world that we have will have or ever anything is is keep him and and rejoice over the fact of what we've got you realized see you're you're younger people coming up you don't understand you know we were life another day uh first job i had when me and my wife got married i made forty dollars a week that was my job forty dollars a week and we paid rent we paid light bill and now on telephone couldn't afford it didn't have a lot of things but you know what we lived you know what my wife she made a lot of the clothes with the kids as we come along and that's what i was thinking about i was just sitting thinking you know lord what is it look what it's been so great to me that i've come from here to here to here to here well that's what i'm trying to do here now and speaking about god and his ways all right see so go ahead for number two just pull up the all right run it on down save time reading okay right there he was other words now let's get down to something that we're talking about forgive me adam the first man in the lower creation of god adam was the first man in the lower creation lower creation means you're dating down to where you start from see look the first creation was god himself he said well well i just said this blows me because how was god ever created he wasn't that's not what you're talking about when god coming into being unveiling himself showing himself revealing himself to where that you can comprehend it the first creation was god himself so that's why we spent so much time in that of going back and saying well what was he back there what did he look like what did he do what did you know and all that trying to get this simple things to hurt of you to understand now back up prior to this he says god is from his point of god as a spirit he said god made a spirit man all right see that's that was his beginning was the spirit man in other words what did he do what did he do he just moved some of himself is how would you how do you think he just moved from this to this he just moved over in another form and as he did it opened up and there he begins to see his family now he's standing back there as to non-existence of any man to comprehend him but he's already got in his mind what he's going to do and how he's going to make his family and and impart himself to his family because that's that's his being and his doing that's what that's the whole thing is to impart himself into you and me see so then in that the first creation was god himself the first thing you can think about coming into being it that would be uh you know tangible i guess tangible would be a word uh that's coming into being something that can be it now i like to hold it that way first watch not not to be seen because he's still in spirit form but so that he could be comprehended and he reveals himself and he begins as he begins see then things start coming into being and he sees all of these things in his mind he knows what the future is going to be he knows all of the things before he ever even starts why because he's he is the first of that creation amen the first one to come into being amen right see and then by him coming into being that means we're going to come into being amen we're coming into being because we're a part of him all right and see look what it's saying then he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation it was the first human thing first mortal thing in the basis of the humanity now not dogs cats that was ever created first but the humanity side doesn't matter what you put it in adam would be the beginning all right now he said the first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos which was the son of god now how can god be comprehended according to what we read in john the son has brought him into the open or showed him revealed him made him all right see then out of god came the lord the word which was the son of god then out of the logos which was the word so just think about it you say well did the word have to come into being not come into being like there never was a word he always was the word amen that's what i love about john 1. i love it the way brother adam says let's see in the beginning with elohim elohim was with god and elohim was god i believe that's a term then see it's always been god the word has always been that you just don't understand church how marvelous to conceive that god would reveal himself to mankind can he come through the word to you because the word logos and all of those come back to the word speech all right and see he he spoke us into existence back there he said no that puts us back no no no no you're the one that's going wrong see i'm still in his mind i'm still in the spirit realm you don't got off into the land come on back with me now get back over here to where you can stay in the land that i'm talking about the spirit land to where we can see how god is a spirit but yet he begins to unveil himself but you know what i like no what was his first creation a spirit man why because he was spirit see the first part of your being whatever you want to call it when we talk about body spirit soul etcetera thing you realize the first part of your being in spirit realm is the realm that god was in when he began to create the spirit realm the place that you can and that's why we talk about and we put the emphasis and i believe it's there of the soul is the main part of the human being i believe that you know i believe that's your being because i believe the soul can condescend deeper into understanding than the body and spirit but yet the spirit is a marvelous thing your spirit within you is a marvelous thing you realize that you that it keeps you alive that it it operates through you and does things and and you can do it in the spirit realm so don't ever get to the point of saying well we don't need the spirit no i've just always taught you what i believe i believe that adam's soul was eternal because the prophet said it blasphemous names all right eve so would then would have been eternal with everything from then on mortal but you know what even a mortal with any contact of god in a spirit realm is a marvelous you realize that everything in the world is created by thoughts of mankind right thoughts of mankind brings into being all of the things that we have in the world cars you know electricity everything is brought in because it's part of god i'm all right go ahead go ahead to number three just pull it on up to the orange part because that's the main you can listen to it backwards forward and see if i'm all for what but yeah now no one has seen god and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by bible readers logos or anointed or the anointing or as i was going to say the part of god began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was now to me that's a definite i mean that to me that that takes so theologian sets him aside over here and says this hush you don't understand what's going on let's get with with the man that can break it down to where we can understand it because that's what he said and look what he done said little light moving he was a word that was the word look now god gave himself birth to his son now remember what it was son of god it's not back there now he's not back there he's not a baby that plots out in the human elements now we're still in the spirit realm right right see god gave himself birth to this son which was before there was even an adam in the air or to make an adam see that was jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world way back in yonder think about it almighty god wanting to dwell with his humanity that gets me it makes it breaks my heart to think how that we've degraded it so much of what we've done with it with mankind but yet that he's been so marvelous and wonderful to reveal himself and to bring it down and to promise that he'd sent us a prophet because he knew we wouldn't be able to understand him he knew with a prophet that it would be hard to understand so he sent a prophet with simplicity language thoughts his hands and carries and totes and the things you know that didn't bother me like i've always said you go up north and you say uh you know to them and they say what do you want to eat so well i want some maters and taters and they'll look at you and maters and taters yes i want some maters and taters they'll go off grinning and giggling right calls your language but they don't bring you soup they bring you maters and taters it's the different language they want to say tomato and potato well okay that's found me getting my maters and taters ain't got no problem we were up there one time this guy said i'll cook anything in the world y'all won't he said but i don't do grits because you could see he was contrary to southern terminologies he said i don't do grips all right let's get on a little bit further go ahead to number four we'll just take some of these and then i'll take it next time notice god is fixing to make another creation he creating mortal earth mortal life angels sing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man now what about creating eternal life for man in other words won't you use it this way he's going to bring into being eternal life all right but here he's creating a new life eternal life for a man and he's singing to his subjects through angels on the earth not in heaven and not in heaven heaven had eternal life but when you moved eternal life to earth and that baby was laying there and then he could come and sing because that was what he was creating very laid in that little cradle he sang to the heavens when the mortal creation came in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to the earthly people the first thing to shepherds isn't that wonderful to think about a mortal an immortal being revealing himself to immort to uh an immortal being to revealing himself to just a mortal being to where we can understand so we can hold it together and keep it in line all right go ahead for number five excuse me yeah number five the holy blood that was created by god the blood the life the creation of god jesus was the beginning of the creation of god oh you see it god made in creation coming into his creation coming into his part he was spirit the bible said he's the beginning of the creation of god how did he begin he began in the wombs of a woman which is what the woman is not you think about it why did he say wounds yeah why did the prophet say wounds that makes him exactly right so that he can come over to uh what is it i'll think of it in a minute about the spoken word look the natural wound and the spiritual one the wounds of a woman mary had to accept in her spiritual wound the point of the child to be born and what god would do then she had to accept in her physical wound so what about he's back over here in the middle of the message somewhere and he just drops it and goes on well to me i when i'm studying i don't look for something like that it just finds you i'm i'm kind of like my wife uh you go to the store with my wife and what did they used to do the blue flag but anyhow you walk in the front door with my wife and she goes stink and there's a lot in the back going not really but it just he and here she goes sails she finds the sails they find her she don't have to hunt them they find hers kind of like that man told me a part uh hamricks that time he said i sure hope they don't nobody don't rob this place well i do too but what do you mean he said cause my wife fingerprints is on everything in here so that's the way women are okay all right but listen see the wounds of a woman word did the beginning of the creation of god start at then in the wound of a woman she gave birth to the very part that should have been go ahead number six jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god revelation 1 is that right then when was when was god created he is the beginning of the creation of god and god is eternal is that right but when did what but when god was created now you're going to deal with a mortal part of god bringing into being something that will be of the part that he has to have to be able to exist with the mankind because if he's going to create mankind he's going to have to be with mankind spirit realm he can be with them because they're spirit but he's coming into mortal thinking of what he's doing so listen but when god was created when was god created see when a little baby that was conceived in the wound of a mother a virgin and she began to develop these cells into her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of god's creation where god was made flesh and dwelt among us and became emmanuel god with us the beginning of the creation of god when did god have a beginning he doesn't have a beginning he has a time to come forth into time into a situation of life but he never begun because he was eternal to start with see he was eternal to start with he was back there all right and in all of that being you think about it think about all of that being because i know i've been questioning this for 40 years about god back there and what did he wear and what did he do and what did he say and how did he and i've always tried to explain one thing god wanted to make himself known and in doing that he would have to have a certain plan and way to do so he would make it manifest through the simplicity and he'd bring it right into mankind right so now think about see stage one we talk about before the world and him stepping forth from behind all of that or whatever him coming forth into that to wreak himself known all right we stopped it remember i kept emphasizing spirit spirit spirit all right but see now that would bring us to a place that we could fellowship in spirit right we could fellowship in spirit because we would be his spirit offspring and fellowship with but there's more to it amen see because in that spirit realm he he he already back before all of that come into being he was a father he was a healer he was a savior he was all that so all of that had to come into being so we only got to the part that spirit man could come into being and adam could come into being in the garden all right and be placed over the animals in the i read it to you there in the spirit realm see because he's a spirit so he could fellowship with man with that and god could come down and fellowship with him and everything but then he had to make him a body because that wasn't enough see he made a body because he knew he was going to make a body to come live in he knew he was going to do that because that would be the point and mankind would come forth into being but we stick more with to just try to keep the point stage two what god coming in to mortal being back there all of that old testament you study it you get in there and you get into finding god in his reality of being i've always said it this way you can find god in in studying because who was the the fourth man in the fire you you can get uh literal things you know you can get into those things and and study them you can study it in the the spirit of mankind because uh the psalmist would ride of the spirit and the things that would take place and how he was and what was doing and all but the soul of man is is not mentioned a whole lot in the old testament it's dire but it's not mentioned a lot but see then it gradually comes forth into being to see the reality of a living god because god is real and when that body was created a spirit steps into the body the body's not eternal but the spirit steps into the body a soul steps into the body now you've got body spirit and soul in the way that god would want it to be to where that he could be mortal and then he could fulfill the scriptures that would talk about him that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself so he could start coming into being as to what he really wanted he wanted to fellowship with us amen you remember that i said that a little bit ago he's lonely it didn't matter how great it was back there i mean i laid up here in the hospital and i thought i'd like for somebody to keep the walls down where i know what's going on around here because i'm i'm i'm messed up and it wasn't much of my head messed up it was just everything there was messed up i mean i'd asked for something and you know i kept trying to tell them i said look what all mind just getting me some claws and getting out of the way you know what i meant get me some washcloths and some soap and get out of my way y'all go leave the room i'll take care of everything you know lady said i can't do it said you you got all these things and that was what was so funny i could sneeze she'd open the door i mean she would just bought us like that as quick as i'd sneeze or move because all that was hooked up i reckon they thought about gonna die or something and they had it all hooked up wondering what's going on but uh it was fun but it wouldn't okay i just hope nobody has to go through those things because it's it's all right but now listen let's get this point and then we'll quit in a minute okay see we go from stage one of god moving in from the unknown the supernatural thing moving over into rims that he can be comprehended all right we got to the spirit realm all right he could be comprehended in the spirit realm because he was spirit all right see then that would not be the end of it because that would not fulfill a spirit he couldn't die for our sins he couldn't do this he couldn't do that and all of the things that he was already had to be he could not have brought them into being to step to stayed in to the rims of the spirit realm so he had to bring it into the natural realm and when he did then you see adam coming into being you see eve coming in to be and you see as i said a while ago then about it that adam i believe according to blasphemous names read it that adam's soul was eternal that's right all right and eve being a part of adam i believe her soul was eternal because brother brown said her ease so was in adam now not in adam like two people standing trying to find out who's what no but see god just simply reached down and took from that body and brought forth an eve but he brought her forth in the correct order he said do you believe that eve's soul is eternal well the prophet said that adam's soul was eternal well were you going to put eve and then you go to questions and answers and genesis and he'll tell you that he was in adam and theophany well where adam was he was and if according to the prophet of that message book that he says your soul is your theophany all right see then they could have eternal life in their soul and look what would have happened um just give you a little run through look what would have happened had adam and eve not sinned do you realize what was standing there do you realize god's family was standing there adam with the ability not to have children as we call it that's you you do what you want to what would would have been what i'm i'm just saying it this way if it hadn't been for the fall and things adam and eve could have produced spoken word children and all of us would have been brought into being okay but you know what would be we would be like adam and eve we would be body mortal soul eternal spirit needing eternity having a lot of dealings with it but needing it well what if what if it happened that adam and eve didn't sin okay see then we could have all went to the tree of life because the tree of life was already in the garden i love that the tree of life was already in the garden we could have went to the tree of life and ate of the tree of life and come forth with eternal bodies because that's exactly what we're doing now we are eating the word of god and eating that word is going to make these bodies eternal that's right amen and see in doing that it's a wonderful day to realize the time in the position but he had to stop now to get my point for just a minute he had to stop at that stage of bringing forth a body because he was a father he was a son he was a human and to do that he'd have to have a mortal body so the old testament would see things moving in and out and speak of it but then all at once here comes a virgin bringing forth a child bringing forth a little feller yes and that little fella wound up being god almighty in human flesh i love the prophet when he says you're god with no teeth i do what i now forgive me okay i'm sorry that i sometimes life but i try to do it inwardly where everybody don't know what i'm lying because you know it tickles me to death to see people try to explain the godhead and you hear them trying to explain it and when they get through explaining you that sure is a mystery you know that's a mystery how that could be what do you realize all it was summed up and brought in jesus christ so let's stop at that point then we'll take the others jesus christ was god made manifest in human flesh no more and no less all that was ever needed or ever wouldn't it be needed or anything to be done was right turn that man he was the healer the savior the all of the things that god had in the beginning that he wanted to make manifest he couldn't do it as a baby so they could make fun of him he couldn't do it as a young child and coming on up and couldn't do it even when he got on up in a certain ages and they'd make fun of him and you know oh you're just a illegitimate baby and he'd say okay i'll forgive you i said now one day the holy ghost would come and says it's not going to forgive you but they didn't care but he said i'll forgive you i know you don't understand what would it be to take to try to explain you know i don't mean wrong but for brother donny to try to explain how to take that car apart and put it back together right here and not leave no parts out in it run richard done that one time with a motor and it actually run i told him i'm surprised but you see what i'm getting now that you got all of these things to bring it to this stage now when you get to that stage you just all you do is you just put it on the hole for about 2000 years and you come through all of the things that would have to do with it the jobs and the and the abraham and moses and all of the things and you bring all of that and that's word that i love with the way the prophet would say he said and the prophets built the body now that's something to me that the prophets built the body but one day that body stood down he said unless you see that i am he you'll die in your sins they had to crucify him he couldn't go no other way but yet think about it that he is still at that stage they said show us the father and suffice he said have i been so long with you so don't you understand don't you understand all these things that's been taking place around here and all the healings and the signs and the different things that's taking place and you're wanting me to tell you to try to reveal me to you he said you're to understand it by just looking and seeing what's going on and knowing it let's stand together come on musician i hope you you know i hope you caught something from the point because all i want you to see is god made manifest and you have to see that in stages see you could look down there at him and say that's almighty god well that's true but he wouldn't make it manifest you need to wait until you can make manifest anybody have a need before we go and just pray one for another thank you yeah all right we're going to have communion now so don't nobody want nobody to run off we're going to have communion and they're going to come and take over wade will we'll just sing a song somebody needs something then turn over to him and they'll direct you out and all in the doings and whatever's to be done for us to take communion i told that to a brother quinn the other day talking to him there in ireland and he said something about communion i said well we had communion the other day how did you do i said well the brothers figured out and they just took all this and had all of the things and the traits and stuff and people just walked right down by them and just took the communion and he said that's marvelous you know he said that's good so let's just sing this one verse if anybody has a need let's sing that course i am blessed i am i am blessed when i lay by the morning till i lay my head to rest i am blessed oh i am blessed oh i am blessed [Music] every day [Music] i am blessed oh i am blessed [Music] amen we're blessed people amen amen to just be able to get together uh we talked about george quinn and they can only travel two miles and the police will stop them and ask them where they're going two miles they can only get food travel two miles and that's it they can do nothing else so we're blessed to be able to uh at least move around and do what we do so we thank the lord for that so let's go to first corinthians 11 23. let's read our communion then when we get finished praying over the communion they'll go downstairs we'll sing another song and then you'll start from the back exit out go down go by take your communion and stand out underneath as we did before last month and stand out here and wait till brother day on the rest of us get downstairs and then he'll tell us to take the communion okay everybody got that amen all right for i have received the lord that which i also delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup that he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me this is not just a ritual we're supposed to remember what jesus christ did for us for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord now what's the body of the lord you and i all right and we're the blood by the spirit as we said a couple of sundays ago so it this includes us the bride of jesus christ this is not something we do we all we all are a part of the body and blood of the lord and if we eat and drink unworthily we're guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the lord that we should not be condemned with this world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come so let's just take a moment of silent prayer brother brown says pray clear your mind and also pray for your pastor amen so let's let's take a moment i'll pray we ask these things in jesus name amen the bible says he took bread and blessed it heavenly father we thank you for this bread lord has been prepared father to do one thing and that's for us to partake in this communion lord and we pray now that you would just be with us lord and furthermore this service lord as we break this bread we know lord that your body was broken for us and lord if anyone has an infirmity lord here in this building father are listening to us tonight today lord we pray that you will just heal their body lord as you were broken for us father you're going to put us back together lord yes we ask these things in jesus name amen don't remember brother bob wins tonight he's preaching for us nor does a as we always say give us our daily bread our daily bread is not this bread here but it's the bread we just heard amen jesus said i am that bread to come from heaven we can eat natural bread and we'll be hungry in the next few hours but if we use the spiritual bread he said you'll never hunger thank the lord for the hands that prepare this i i can remember uh sitting on the counter in in galesville in the house upon the hill there and we just we were in the baptist church and we left there in 68 but during that time i think we were the ones that kind of held the communion and we'd buy the little we daddy would buy little things in a box and there'd be little cracker things and and they would get them out them out well it's kind of spiritual in it thaw them out and uh well that's all they need to do right and and then get the grape juice and then when you got the grape juice out they'd have to cut grape juice to make sure that it didn't choke anybody so um you see what but see that's a that's a uh a type of them diluting the word of god we don't dilute the word of god we use fresh wine right we use fresh bread and it's prepared by by we don't know that could have been made whoever that was made for that in in back in that time but but this was made fresh and then it will be burned in the evening after we get finished with it nothing will be held over because we want fresh man in the morning even though we're not in church we still want fresh manna in the morning i mean you want like brother dale said whether you're on your lawnmower or in your chicken truck or wherever you you're at let god speak to you fresh manna the heavenly father thank you for this wine lord that has been made lord by holy hands and just went through a process that you lord instituted that we drink it until you come father because this wine it gets better with age it does not lord it does not ever lose its power just like your word father it will never ever lose its power thank you for it lord as we partake of this communion you sanctify the partakers and everyone that's in this building and hearing our voice lord we pray that you'll be with us in jesus name amen those of you that are downstairs just wait until uh just wait until we sing this song and let the let the top get down first and then y'all come in behind if that's all right and if we get out a little bit out order it's not gonna hurt anything so let's go ahead and sing a song i am [Applause] when i wake up in the morning when i leave head [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am [Music] oh i am blessed i am [Music] when i wake [Applause] i am man you musicians y'all
