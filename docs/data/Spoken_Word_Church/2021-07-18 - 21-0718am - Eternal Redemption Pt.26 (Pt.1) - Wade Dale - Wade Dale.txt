priests of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us and him entering in as i read the scripture on grace we can now enter in cambodia to the throne of grace now let's go to amos 3 verse 7. and 8 surely the lord will do nothing everybody got that this is the lord saying he's going to do nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets so he's got to have a prophet that he can speak through not not 40 different as we're going to look in just a minute not 400 prophets of baal that went up to i mean you know come on now there was one elijah stood on that mountain by himself amen amen all right his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy and let's read revelations 11 verse 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days for those of you that don't know that's 1260 days clothed in sackcloth you may be seated in the lord as blessing the reading of the word now what we're going to do just for a moment is we're going to cover i we talked about this you know a couple weeks ago in the jubilee and we wonder sometimes why things happen everything happens for a purpose and there's nothing new under the sun there's nothing that that got god all nervous he knew exactly what was going on before the foundation of the world and have you ever thought about this we would know nothing of a man named job until god brought his attention to the devil nothing was written of job except well we had a family and he had you know had animals and but nothing happened to job until god brought his attention to the devil that's what i was trying to think you know we were many times a couple of weeks ago we were bragging a little bit you know and we were only bragging on god you know that but it brought the attention to the devil i'm sure he said they're bragging a little too much god said well okay have you considered my spoken word church up there in lula georgia amen but remember whatever happened to job christ came on the scene elihu came on the scene the fourth man in the fire not the three accusers i'm not going to worry about them but illegal came on the scene and he said listen to what i'm saying and job stood up and he job finally said i know my redeemer lives and the end of job remember was greater than the beginning he was restored two-fold amen so let's take that as not having the spirit of fear right but of love and a sound mind i like brother ernie always quoted that scripture not having the spirit of fear and we're going to continue on as we are amen try not to skip a beat we'll do the best we can with what we got but we like to brag on god amen and bragging on god sometimes you have to prove it and that's what we're doing now amen we're proving that we know who our redeemer is and christ did come on the scene and if you'll read there where christ tells job all the different things he tells him then you can see that that's christ talking to me and you i don't have time to go through that i just wanted to interject that and also we were looking at the jubilee now the jubilee was two weeks ago in the 50th year so let's turn to leviticus or they'll pull it up on the screen i kind of want to bring this out i've been impressed to speak on this also but i just want to put this in as a snippet this morning we always talk about the jubilee year what all the different things will happen i'm going to cover it just a few minutes if that's okay because this part of redemption anyway now look leviticus 25 verse 8 it says thou shalt number seven sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years because real short in the old testament there was a release every seven years you worked six years in its seventh year there was a release but it was not a release to where everything went free only certain things there were requirements you had to meet in the church ages or in the seven years amen certain requirements that you had to meet if and and they're all you can read them in there if you marry a wife but if he gives you a wife she's got to stay because see you can't take your family out totally until that 50th jubilee now think about that think about what we in two weeks ago what we entered we entered the jubilee not the seven sevens we entered the golden jubilee the 50th year that has never been before it has never been um in israel or in the jewish part they've never had a 50 jubilee they've never they've done the seven sevens but listen let's watch this and that shall be forty and nine years so every seven years there was a release it was a partial release though not a complete release if i got that say amen stay with me just a minute then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land now look leviticus 25 10 and you shall hallow the 50th year so 7-7-49 you got to go that one more year to celebrate that jubilee now remember that jubilee though let me show you what happens and he shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you talking about the jewish people and you shall return every man unto his possession right whatever the devil took away from you god's going to bring back because watch what happens and you shall return every man unto his family you didn't have that promise under 7 7. you could partially go how many times have we claimed our family how many times are we still claiming our family well maybe we were under a 49 and they couldn't go free but we're not under 49 anymore a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that's what's growth of itself nor gather the grapes and it of thy vine undressed in other words you're not going to plan anything you're going to live off what you had the previous years for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field so whatever's been planted in this church for 50 years we're going to live off of that amen that's what we're living off of we're going to live off that what's already been planted listen i can't bring you nothing new you can't bring another preacher in here and bring you nothing new they hadn't already been preached all right you shall eat the increase thereof of the field in the year of this you jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession everything brother branham said they would watch on top of that mountain and said jubilee he said you throw down your hole you go get your family and you go back to freedom in the seven sevens you had to leave somebody there or you had to leave part of your possession there's all that leviticus and exodus all those different ones you can read that but let's read this just a little snippet and we'll get started on eternal redemption look in leviticus 25 54 says if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of do you believe both he and his children with him now if you've claimed your children all these years this is the year you're going to see them come you better believe that because that is our year of jubilee where everything can go free well mike there you go with your laundry list my kids can't because well they probably said the same thing about you your mom and daddy but no they didn't they said no i'm these are my kids so let's look at that all of us we all have kids that have been put in bondage under that 49 that's been put in bondage but here we come we give a promise that the 50th year that you can take all your children and go free but let me warn you about something too let's go to the book of exodus exodus 21 verse 5 if you want to just stay the way you are if you just want to stay the way you are you didn't have to go out in that 50th year [Applause] you made a choice on that 50th year whether to go free or what and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children what did jesus tell us he said if you can't forsake father mother sister and brother you'll have no part with me now not to do away with them you understand but do not put them first you put god first then you claim your wife you claim your children you can't claim your wife and children if you don't have god first you got to have the baptism of holy ghost you got to have something to feed off of you got to have something for god to come to the new birth don't claim your children when you need to be claimed yourself i know that hurts but shake it up folks see that's what's happened when this jubilee you say well no no yes yes i believe we're in that 50th jubilee where we can claim everything we got and we can go free now look what happens though i will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges and he shall also bring him to the door unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him forever let's don't go back let's don't stand say this is status quo this is good enough yeah we we're going to be status quo as far as running the church and all the different things because that's the way it's been set up but let's don't say this is the end this is we're done we're finished no we're not this is the jubilee go free from that old master and claim your family and and it didn't say he claimed his family and then they came later turn it back down to the next one i mean the one before that if he not be redeemed his years then he shall go out in the year of jubilee both he and his children with him he grabbed his family and he took them out from under that bondage and they went free and they were able to be restored and that's what i'm looking for folks i'm looking for a restoration of whatever god wants to bring us if he wants to bring us gifts prophecy he's already brought us good preaching we've got a good foundation the jubilee year is on folks it's not that we're going to have some new something but we're going to eat of the old corn of the land we're going to eat what's already been established here and that's the way we're going to eat and we're going to eat that way from sunday to sunday until brother dale's ready to come back in here and put the harness on hey man and that's just the way it is if you have any questions or comments there are some things that that we may do i'm thinking about maybe bringing some ministers in maybe once a month to just kind of help us with some outside you know bring some outside people in a little bit brother hyatt's coming this week brother andrew glover's coming in september so we may just do that but we'll take counsel i want you to remember the deacons elders and ministers of this church are all together in one amen and we'll stay together amen and if there's anything that needs to be um any something hard or harsh it needs to be taken care of we still got a pastor god will give us the right thing to do amen so let's not have the spirit of fear let's just pray for brother dale pray for all of us and we'll continue on and listen we're in a jubilee year listen we're not going back if you go back you're gonna get bored in the air and you're just gonna get bored that's right hey man it's just it's gonna bore you but let's just not let it borrow us okay amen if you have any questions or concerns just please feel free to uh to contact us or we we're praying for brother dale praying for mom that and kind of keep it to where he can recover and we can already see that that he he's here all right so let's turn to the book of revelations and as we were talking i just want to kind of get that out of the way because i don't want there's always you know there's a devil there he's always throwing stuff in your mind and sometimes you say why well i don't think job job might or not said why but when he got to the end i'm sure job said man i know i had to go through that for god to give me what he gave me he gave me my life and gave me twice what i had before so so where i'm looking for a double portion are you not looking for a double portion i'm looking for a double porsche whatever god's got double it and that what elisha asked for when elijah left he said i want a double portion now brother brown said he lies to top the bride so the bride needs to call for a double portion to be on us it's listen it's going to take that double portion to get us out of here remember grace grace it's going to take grace grace to get us out of here amen so now let's continue on i've been studying a little bit more and like i said before there's been some new ones with questions and that's great and wonderful i really enjoy that it makes the church bind together more even when certain things happen and and people have questions and as i wrote if you'll pull back up let's pull back up amos and read that again surely the lord god will do nothing now look he'll do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so like i said before the prophet we know the prophet's the lord jesus christ the prophet's the word of god but it has to speak when you bring a prophet on the scene he has to speak right every prophet you've you've seen in the old testament they've had to speak something they didn't just come on the scene well now here's elijah elijah died what would that have good done any good no elijah shows up and starts prophesying we had nothing else of him in the past either like job you didn't hear him nothing until he comes up and says elijah the tishbite walks up to the woman and says give me some of that meal and some of that flour but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy so now let's go to exit let's go to revelations one we know that's the seven church ages and the seven golden candlesticks so let's go down to verse 20 for save time we're going to continue on this this afternoon and try to get down to a place the mystery of the seven stars which i saw to my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches in the seven candlesticks was thou south are the seven churches so there has got to be after the death of jesus christ there is a gentile bride taken out and there is seven church ages and seven spirits that are given prophets stars messengers from god if you want to look at the greek lexicon when you look at those stars it's a messenger from god now see you can have as i there's a lot of contention not in not in the message you're not not the true message believers but it's just contention now that they say that brother branham fed off clarence larkin and he used this and he used this one and he he fed off of this one well so do we listen the difference in clarence larkin listen i believe god spoke to clarence larkin just like he spoke to dwight moody just like he spoke to calvin finney all those different great men god spoke to them because they were part part of the ministry of the age but they weren't confirmed prophets that you could put in the bible you see clarence larkin had a message from god because listen the baptist had the word of god when in the beginning when the smith brothers or whoever it was started there's always been people wonder and say why do you have to listen to what a man says every denomination every thou 13 000 domination started by what one man said so why should it be so strange that we listen to this one that we listen to because he was vindicated in the word of god clarence larkin was not right he was under the age of ministering or being a minister of the gospel and could get revelation from god yes dwight moody brother brown said put millions into the kingdom luther wesley but there was no one clarence larkin had a revelation but he didn't have a message that was tied to the bible personal because you're going to read it right here malachi 4. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and there's something he's going to do see like i said didn't you send elijah and silence no no and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so it wasn't malachi 3 and the first part of malachi 4 was john the baptist we know that right because the great and dreadful day of the lord did not come back when jesus was here and then we read last sunday we'll read it again matthew 17 and his disciples ask him saying why then say the scribes that elish or elijah must first come they're looking for elijah over in in jerusalem because of malachi 4. because that's their last book in their bible they don't have a new testament and jesus answered and said unto them elias or elijah truly shall first come and restore all things the first elijah we'll read it in just a minute in kings we turn to it now the first elijah had to restore an altar the third elijah was to what to proclaim the coming of the messiah the fourth coming of elijah is to restore all things because remember when the fifth elijah goes that doesn't restore all things that only restores jerusalem so we had to have a gentile prophet hello somebody a gentile prophet for all nations that's why even i was reading yesterday brother branham so much wanted to go to israel to take that sign he'd have broke every scripture in the bible if he would have went over there the rapture would have took place for the jews if he'd have went over there god said no you can't go it's not ready yet but i think maybe he whispered in his ear and said you're not going physically but i'm going to send your message over there amen i'm going to send your message over there and he was satisfied with that amen but let's look in first kings let's read this it's kind of long reading but it's okay i like reading the bible and elijah son of the prophets of baal now this is elijah this is the restorer this is the first elijah the pattern elijah remember you always got to have a pattern elijah the first elijah was the pattern elijah and elijah said under the prophets of baal 400 of them it took 400 of them they thought to get bail on the scene to get all them denominational oh nevermind because they were all false choose you one bullet for yourself in other words elijah didn't jump and say look i'm the man of the hour i'll choose the bullock i'll choose where it goes no he said issues you choose to battle ground you choose for yourself and dress it first for a year or many 400 of them 400 preachers standing on a mountain against one man kind of like them 300 preachers in chicago stood up to elijah one time and had a mount carmel experience calling the name of your gods gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it called on the name of baal from morning till noon saying oh baal hear us but there was no voice their prophet had no voice they're trying to call something on the scene that has no voice has no message think about this and they dressed it up and called on the name of baal from morning till noon saying oh they'll hear us but there was no voice nor any of that answered and they what leaped on the altar which was made in other words by the time they got finished with this thing it was a bloody mess because remember we're going to read they started slitting each other and they started bleeding and they started stomping the altar what they got kind of mad i guess i'm sorry their god didn't show up and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry loud for he's a god either he's talking or he's in other words he's someone's on vacation maybe you need to find a college secretary or he is in a journey or pre-adventure he's asleep and he must be awakened and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances till the blood gushed listen at least there was one thing for sure they were dedicated amen give them that much credit they were dead they took their denominational idea to the extreme would you but you don't have to and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so has to be in the evening time it's when god's going to show up there was neither voice nor in other words there was silence for all day nor any of it regarded and elijah said unto all the people now remember there was 400 prophets and then there had to be people because remember at the very end of this thing they take them 400 prophets down to the book kidro brook kidron and kill every one of them wow okay so they had to be herded up by what the congregation that saw who was right and who was wrong and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar see there's the restoration he repaired the altar he put the stones back he put the wood in order watch and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob remember he was a prophet in the old testament unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones what's the stone thrones of revelation he brought he restored the revelation back to the way it was supposed to be and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord not baal and not in the name of lords am i shouting too hard for you okay and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altars greatest would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order he's putting everything back in order he he's not just gonna walk up and say well this is a bloody mess but i'm gonna call the lord no he put everything back in order he restored it to where it looked like before they when they first walked up there all right so in other words that elijah was a restorer of the word a restorer of the stone and the wood he cut the sacrifice in pieces laid him on the wood and he said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrificing on the wood and he said do it a second time first pull second pull hallelujah and they did what he said here's the key somebody what the prophets of baal i'm sure they're standing over there trying to clean themselves up after cutting herself to pieces they're not over there helping elijah it's the congregation that got a revelation that maybe this guy elijah has something about him that them 400 pieces of preachers denominational preachers don't have do it a second time and they did it the second time he said do it a third time it took the third pull they did it a third time and all the water talk about washed by the water of the word that water run all the way down they want no fire nowhere to be seen i'm sure the bales are prophets of bale are going how many gallons of water is he going to pour on that it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so now we're in the evening time that elijah the prophet came there he came to me and you because he said behold i send you elijah the prophet he said lord god of abraham isaac of israel and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel not god's and that i am thy servant look and i have done all these things at thy word brother preach the sermon after our word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast what turned their heart back again did malachi 4 say amen malachi 4 had turned heart of the fathers to the children children to the fathers here elijah said lord that thou has turned their heart back again in other words away from those prophets of baal because they're fixing to take them as you continue to read on which we're not going to read on the congregation takes those 400 prophets down to the brook and kill all 400 of them so you can take bail all you want to i'll take god i'll take god in the prophet that he sent that turned my heart back because look malachi 4 read it again behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now talk about this elijah it's obvious this is the first one this is back in the old testament but he's sending this prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord folks if you don't know the coming of the lord's near you're deceived right listen every day we get closer to the coming of the lord whether you believe it or not and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse there's our prophet that's going to turn us back lord thou hast turn their heart back again to what to the faith that was once delivered to the saints to the original there was no doctrine besides the doctrine of god in the first two or three ages there was no denomination sure there were spirits but there was no baptist on this corner methods on this corner and pen they can't all be right god can't be that confused if not he would have took him 400 prophets and says okay you go set you up a church over there and you take about 20 of them you go search your church over there you take about 20 of those and you get you a leader and you're going to set you 20. uh-uh elijah said i only i only am a prophet i only am thy servant sent from god and what about elijah then we know what he'd done all during his life he restored the shunamite woman in elisha and jezebel was cursed so we know the two women that malachi or the prophet elijah had to deal with we already preached on that so let's go to number one and read it we got to get to the two prophets somewhere but see we got to establish we got to establish that profits are what we need go back to amos he'll do nothing nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophet first he's got to give it to them first that's right even in my even in revelations 10 7 he had to give it to the revelations 10 7 had to say but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god to be finished and then john takes the book there had to be a voice of a prophet in the end time there's a voice of a prophet in every age but like i said before clarence larkin some of the different ones they had pieces okay that's not bad it come from god but he didn't he wasn't identified just like we can identify this prophet william branham in the scripture and the life that he had was totally the life of elijah a woodsman he hated women bad women he didn't hate good women he was married to one i don't see how people understand stuff like that well he hated women no he married one and then that one died he married another one it wasn't he was so against women had a couple of girls himself i don't see why people don't it was the bad one it's always the bad he didn't rebuke a congregation up there he rebuked him 400 prophets of baal right right right that's right now this message of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 i just read he will turn the hearts of the children what children pentecostal babies to the fathers in other words restore us back to where there was no denomination there was no denominational idea in peter james john paul all the different apostles in the new testament they didn't have a denominational idea it was developed because it became a saying a deed and a doctrine we understand that through the seals and that's how satan he goes in real slow a saying well i don't know if he was out there hunting on the day he was supposed to be or not i don't know i don't know that cloud you know they said maybe it was a you see what i mean but see what that goes to though that goes to a doctrine saying deed doctrine and when it becomes a doctrine people take that as a doctrine then they go away because they have to they can't take the real doctrine give me listen he was a word prophet he revealed the word of god to me and that i do not it doesn't matter like brother dick addison said one time he said i don't care if they find out brother adam had 12 wives and the reason he said we know it didn't but that's an extreme but he brought the word to me that nobody else brought he was a word prophet he brought the word to me and i can understand it and and and we don't have to dwell on all the human things if we dwell on all of our human things we're not going to go anywhere anyway according to malcolm 4 he returned the hearts of the children to the fathers in other words what he said time to loose ends what were the loose ends denominational ideas in other words like i said he said lutheran loose sin is like brother paul you got a cord you got a long cord which is the word of god it's eternal it can't be broken satan comes in and goes there's a trinity there's an eternal hell women it's okay for you to cut your hair well that's just old testament stuff no it's not it's a new testament you see what i mean satan kept cutting those cords of the word he couldn't do away with it he could cut the cord what lose this effect so the loose ends would hang down so what did it take it took a restoring profit not a larkin or a moody they were reformers right it took a restoring profit to what tie the loose ends back together and make it one long cord again so there's no idea that somebody else is i well i have this idea that's okay to have an idea but if it's contrary to the word of god it's just an idea amen so two i hope this is okay it's kind of a refresher course for us but but you know what have you ever sat down and tried to understand why god sent you elijah the prophet you need to sit down somewhere and say why'd you send him to me lord why because we were part of them loose ends actually we were hung by them he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10. let's don't get all everybody okay don't say unto trumpet in a minute he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders look that's just revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals which is not a mystery it's it's written jesus preached them in matthew and you can read them in revelations what six five whatever six some six so you can read them but it took somebody to interpret that because god said also that he would hide it from the wise and prudent but reveal it unto babes such as we'll learn such as will learn it will be these divinely revealed so it's going to take god not a man's idea it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so everybody all right with that let's go to number two feast of the trumpets brother brown said now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages as the son of god now what did this let me explain this real quick the son of god is a revelation to give you the new birth to change your soul from a sinner to a saint that's what he said he'd do i'll send back the comforter and he will not just come with you he'll come in you all right now that's the son of god he said i will he said you know all the different things he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you the world will see me no more but you'll see me all these different things i'll send the comforter back in my name and he'll what leads you and guides you into all truth everybody got that but there was still some loose ends that god winked at the ignorance of man let satan cut the cord to see what you do with it right exactly that's the way i can i can explain it god allowed satan to cut the co and started god never started the denomination ever right right but he allowed satan to do that he just did he allowed him to do it what to see what man would do god being a spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church ages in the congregation as the holy spirit among the people so now we find in the laodicean church age this is revelation 3 14. that remember he said behold i stand at the door knock he was put out of the church why god can't stay in a denominational situation because it's false god's not where false is god's where truth is and he's trying to get back in to the church and they won't let him in no way listen if you let him back in we're gonna have to come on we're gonna do away with our denomination we're gonna have to do away with this we've got to do away with being able to smoke a little bit and drink a little bit and party a little bit and wear what i want to wear not what i want you understand what i mean it's like i said about grace this morning it's the grace of god that i don't do the things i do that i used to do it's the grace of god because you know what yeah be real with yourself sometimes your old self wants to do it again brother boyd put his finger up i think i'll put mine up too i think brother john oh okay right right but it's that tie post it's that thing down inside of you that says amen the things i used to do i do them no more why because there's a different person inside now that's the change i want first then that's going to take me to a body change within the layout of cnas because they said you're rich have need of nothing see you can't talk to people in this age you can't hardly convert get anybody converted or even listen to you hello why because they know it all they got google and know it not i'm reading the bible now this is not man's idea that you're miserable poor naked and blind and don't know it he was put out of the church age then according to luke 17 30 he said as it was in the days of sodom lord have we not got one of them conditions here got transgender people running the country and so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now he was reading the same genesis that we read now notice that sodom remember what happened in sodom now let's go to the next one now what is the sign of the son of man because we need that sign of the son of man because in the church ages he was the son of god but the son of man revelation let's go to the next one queen of sheba 1960. jesus said as was in the days of sodom so shall be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel down there to the church elect what he done nobody understand what he's talking about he came to elijah melchizedek and the two angels came to a lot came i'm sorry came to abraham thank you came to abraham right he stayed with abraham now what was that melchizedek was not a spirit that was a man that was god that had put on a little human flesh and talked to his elect abraham what happened to the two prophets they went to israel no they went to the they went to the world he said a modern billy graham and oral roberts see there a lot of people have bashed them too but i'm telling you they're identified in the scripture too they're not major prophets but brother brown said they were come to pray to blind the eyes of the gentiles right and bring in listen these people were saved and gonna be in the in in the in heaven that was converts of billy graham and oral roberts he sure got lot and his wife out part of the way his wife but he sure got them out of sodom right the two the two prophets that went down there what are you trying to say listen we we harp on we don't heart but we know that william brown was a prophet but he was a prophet to a bride because everybody else that turned him down he's condemned them it's condemnation to turn it down but now i don't mean that you're damned to hell there's going to be people being given eternal life if you'll really think about it there's going to be if it's one in a million look how many more people that's going to be on this earth not as bride but as eternal people there's going to be way more than they are us way more by millions no by billions by billions there's going to be more people that are given eternal life or that are justified and died you've got children that don't make it to the age of accountability man the world's going to be populated that city is where you and i are going to live just for the bride and it's a very small part of the earth amen so let's don't think we're so great now yeah we are great because god told us we're great but we're not the only ones that's going to be there it's not us for no more what are you saying brother these people i'm not damning nobody that's not my job i'm just telling you that me and you though have been given a grace i have been given an opportunity for god to open the word up that he's never opened to anybody else and he knows you'll take it or not he knows you'll take it or not he said look down here at this generation what he's doing now they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it there you are but it come just the same and evil and adulterous generation will seek after a sign and they'll have it it'll be given to them as jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three now what resurrection the sign that we were given in the end time is a resurrection sign nobody had ever been able to stand night upon night for 30 years and tell the people what they did two years ago what doctor they went to what color clothes they had on what house number they lived at nobody was able to do that now maybe in part people prophesied but there was a man stood there in a prayer line and he said i saw you yesterday sitting on the side of a bed you had on a red dress and the doctor was blond-headed and had on glasses now what was he looking at god had inhabited a man so much god had inhabited a man he had moved over so much to where one day even in a prayer line remember he said this is not the voice of william branham but it was there was no change in the voice listen to your tape it's like 1959. he's in a prayer line or or they're praising the lord he said this is not the voice of william branham this is the voice of god but it never changed it didn't go this is god talking now no it was brother brown's voice he had moved over so much so we got a resurrection signed where a man say you've got cancers on your left breast and you saw a doctor yesterday you live at one two three four west so-and-so street amen oh i see you you're with a man and he's got a headache and he's got cancer and they know y'all you're praying for your son and your son's got so-and-so and he's over at the hospital heavenly days nobody's ever done that except jesus himself our resurrection sign that you can do that too [Music] you can do now listen there was one sign that he had that he could stand there night after night and declare that god was there he said i can't do anything until he comes well there was a prophet of the hour they had the baptism of the holy ghost a manifested son of god and he still had to wait on something right he had to wait on an anointing he had to wait on that anointing of what he's here because he's the one that's going to talk to you right i'm just going to move out of the way he said it's a gear remember he says the gear that i get in well you know what it's a gear to get out of the way we need to get in that gear but the resurrection will be the sign now remember we see jesus when he was here he said i am the resurrection and the life never went to a funeral i wonder how many people were raised from the dead in brother brown's ministry and there's no telling how many there's so many ever how many documented cases but how many that's undocumented why he the son of man was there it was god in human flesh now remember brother brown wasn't the son of man we spoke that again he was a son of man yielding himself so that this son of man could take over and remember it was never wrong never wrong always was right never missed it when i owed them you remember that one time somebody was talking about that after brother brown declared this woman lived at a certain street you remember somebody telling someone one of the brothers was telling about that remember that he said oh now brother ma'am you missed that said that woman lives at so-and-so they went back to the woman the woman said i moved yesterday you didn't know about it but god did hallelujah god knew about it the woman had moved one day before and the man didn't know that the woman moved so he thought brother brown that's wrong that's where she used to live she said no i moved yesterday god's never wrong folks if god's wrong we need to find somebody else to serve but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection this sign is given to the church in this last day the angel of the holy spirit in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ is raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it are you that generation so let's go now everything is then is based everything we have is based on resurrection so we have a resurrection look resurrection is a state of having passed completely through death and having risen from the dead to be in resurrection is different than to be alive to be alive is the original state without having passed through death self-explanatory look to be in resurrection is to have passed through death and to have been raised up now jesus christ did that because everybody else that has been resurrected lazarus and all them people that resurrected in brother battle's ministry they probably have already passed on but the lord jesus he passed on and then he came back and he never passed no more on so it's based on that somebody resurrected from the dead and he still as the bible says alive forevermore amen because that way you and i can have confidence i can't have confidence in lazarus lazarus is gone he died that's right i can't have confidence in all these other now listen i'm not gonna say i don't have confidence in william branham okay but he's done passed on my confidence is in jesus christ my confidence is because he's the only one that died rose and he don't have to die no more but now remember too all those that have passed on they're in that same situation now they'll never die again and they're not dead now anyway they're more alive now than they ever have been first corinthians 15 verse 12. we'll get to the two prophets this afternoon if that's all right now christ be praying i've been trying two services donnie so help me now christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there's no resurrection of the dead pharisees and sadducees that's who he's dealing with but if there be no resurrection of the dead then his christ not risen in other words he wasn't there he was somewhere and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vein and your faith is also vain everybody got that all right resurrection revelations 20 verse 4. and i saw thrones and they sat on them and judgment was given now look see look at the revelation you and i have now see when we see this what do we see we see us setting in judgment not at judgment right because see it's been a revelation look and i saw thrones now the denominations don't see it that way they see a throne and everybody's got to stand in before them not so it took a profit not a larkin not a moody because you know what they probably died under that same anointing that they were going to have to go through a tribulation or be resurrected and have to give an account at the great white throne this is the great white throne you will not hit this if you're born again today you'll be the part of the thrones now look there's not gonna be millions of thrones who are all gonna be sitting like this that's why i'm sitting here you're at the throne right here you're the throne room you are the throne of grace so there's going to be people and sure they sat upon what in judgment and judgment was given unto them not to them read that scripture in other words here you judge the people is that that's what it says judgment was given unto them not to them see what that little word makes a big difference because it wasn't judgment thank you was given and they're all going to know it was given unto them in other words you judged because the bible already told us the saints will judge the earth and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded now watch look at this now that we're beheaded for the witness of jesus for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon the forehead or in their hand and they lived in the reign of christ a thousand years he's talking about the people that are standing on a throne because we're going to live and reign with christ a thousand years he's talking about the bride but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the first see i i don't know where the where they get the doctrine that the first resurrection is not gonna do you any good i guess if you've got to go to the white throne judgment because it says right here blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years that's us not in judgment with judgment the judgment is with us not against us that's right you've already been judged if you're born again oh please understand that first thessalonians 4 we'll stop right here we'll start right here this afternoon but i would not have you ignorant brethren okay today brethren i wouldn't i have you ignorant concerning them when you're asleep that you sorrow not even as others oh i hope i make it oh i hope mama made it oh i hope something made it i like what brother mike said you can start out with hope but you can't stay at hope hope has to go into faith amen you can't hope you're saved right you got to have faith that god's already saved you for if we believe are we believers today for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with them for this we say unto you by the word of the lord paul being a prophet that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep so what are we looking for first like i said before we're looking for the dead in christ to rise first not a rapture not even a body change we got to get the dead saints out of the ground first this is the order that's why we're trying to go through this this whole thing that i've been preaching has been in order it's an order of what's happening in eternal redemption it's an order and we've not got we've only got to to the dead in christchurch first the the we haven't got to the two witnesses hopefully we'll get to them this afternoon because you've got two witnesses you've got the battle of armageddon you've got us coming back in the millennium you've got us living a thousand years you've got the battle of gog and magog you've got the future home or then you've got the white town judgment then you've got a future home all these different things we haven't covered we ain't even gotten a future home yet but it's part of eternal redemption for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the world's looking for that i'm assuming we've already had it amen god hiding himself in simplicity but revealing himself in the same. you believe god's revealed the message to you then you've heard the shout watch the show hey what is it i'm presenting you behold i send you elijah the prophet with a message [Music] the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and whose archangel christ himself we know that and with the trump of god speaking the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up there's the rapture together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord now listen we're not going to start here and you're going to see us going up through the clouds remember it's sacred the world's not going to see us leave brother brown said 500 people could leave the world and nobody ever knew it and if there's only going to be a few of us alive and remain they ain't going to be millions and the world's not even going to know it wikipedia won't even know you're gone some of you got that some of you did so anyway paul did so anyway wherefore comfort one that's why you're sitting right here wherefore comfort one another with these words do we comfort ourselves knowing that we've heard the shout out everything watch this look keep going let's go a little bit further let's go one more and then we'll close right here first corinthians 15 51 favorite scripture behold i show you a mystery now in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god should be finished listen there's only one mystery left folks and that's how god can change your vile body and not have to get you another one that's the mystery because listen the whole world don't believe that that's right the whole world believes you gotta die and leave your body where it's at because it's vile and god's going to give you a brand new one that's not resurrection that's replacement listen that would be easy to do but god don't like easy because he's hiding it because listen i'm telling you 99.9 of the world believes that there's nothing good about this it's never going to be good and you're going to have to put it away in a grave leave it there and god's going to just there you got a new one no no resurrection is not replacement resurrection is bringing up what went down did jesus grab a new body and leave that other one in the tomb and grab him a new one and then just come walking around listen they won't be an empty one with ray gabriel they won't be an empty one i mean there'll be an empty tomb with all of you that have lost your loved ones because god's going to bring that body up how in the world would he do it and then not do it for the rest of us he's the first fruits is that what the bible says he's first fruits empty tomb now is it going to look like where you go and you look down and you look in and like the what was the i ain't even gonna say it never mind somebody had a video where people were coming up out of the graves you know uh secret folks secret catching away listen if you're gonna have a glorified body and god's gonna change your body and make it young again and make it glorified you're not going to have to dig dirt to get out you see all this though see how that the world is so deceived because i've had them tell me one day the graves were just going to open up huh that ain't secret jesus is just going to come park the park park the clouds and come down through the eastern sky that's what i told the brother i said when you see that he was a brother i and he wasn't in the message but he's a pentecostal brother he said oh i just can't wait so i just keep looking at the eastern sky just waiting for the cloud to part and jesus i said tommy you i said brother you're going i said you done missed it according to the bible because my bible says that we'll go as a thief in the night nobody will ever know it that coming will be judgment right that coming when he comes down and every eye shall behold that's judgment folks that's you better watch out you don't because listen when you see that you're gonna be running that way behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound we've heard that and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruption was put on incorruption and this mortality mortal must put on immortality all right we're going to stop right we're going to read revelations 4 1 because that's the rapture and then we're going to stop right there and after this i looked and behold the door was open to heaven listen folks this is real this is the rapture of the church this is the word that's not even in the bible it's always catching away or caught up so let's don't look for a rapture it will happen when these other things happen all right let's go by scripture resurrection got it change you changed in a moment twin club an eye then catching up rapture whatever you want to call it culmination okay you okay you might have to wear earplugs after this i looked after what after the church ages revelations one two and three is what church ages right right so after this after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven open book open door if a book's closed if the door's closed how in the world you're going to get in it and you know what jesus is so nice he could he's still knocking on that door but not for us we opened the door and let him in and then that we did that he opened the door to the bible and then he opened the door in heaven and after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was that it were a trumpet what a message talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter because listen when we're when we're gone from here we're in a marriage supper for three and a half years waiting on israel to get there to get their atonement so there's a lot more to happen even after we're resurrected and raptured okay and immediately i was in the spirit behold now see one throne see we're not in judgment we're going to meet our savior we're going to meet our husband we're going to meet our god and there's only one of them and if you're if he's sitting on the throne of your heart it's going to connect with that throne up there amen it's going to be the same guy sitting on it it's not two guys sitting hello it's the same guy sitting on this throne in that drone only god can do that and behold the throne was set in heaven and one not three one set on the throne let's stand to our feet musicians come one standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks one god and his name is what lord jesus christ what a revelation listen folks by no means am i belittling the world but there has to be a separation if we live like the world we're of the world and we get their condemnation i'm just sorry like brother brown said you know i hate segregationalism but god's a segregationist the prophet of god said he was born i tell you about somebody standing up and saying that in the 60s that was pretty rough but he said god's a segregation that's why he told israel he said don't you go over there and play with them people don't you go over there with those ice and start playing with them well i'm telling you don't be playing with the heights out in the world you're a segregated group of people if your bride he has put you in a place he has if you put yourself in a place you're in trouble but if he puts you in the place he said now i call you bride under the voice under the shout and the trumpet i call you bride then you have been pulled away from the world and segregated away from the world into what a new world i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man old things are passed away i've been born again let's sing a song god bless you and we'll continue this this afternoon we'll probably get to the two witnesses we're there [Music] [Music] [Music] is every time confess that jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] that jesus christ is [Music] [Music] he has risen from the dead and he is alone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that jesus christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] christ anymore you know there's a difference the whole world as that song says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess but you know what we do it willingly we do it now because we know he's our lord amen but some that are going to have to get way over there and have to be in judgment that's going to have to literally get on their knees and say that's the lord and never be able to make it but they're going to confess that they missed it lord please don't do that people if you don't know the lord get to know him they ain't a thing in this world that's worth there's nothing worth not knowing the lord you say oh i'm just this is too hard for me and no it's not why would god make it hard for his children we make it hard [Music] we make it hard in our humanity god's not gonna make it hard if you'll get god inside of you it's gonna be real easy you'll see the world in a whole different perspective you'll see the word of god in a whole different way you'll see things that go on around your life i hope that that this year i i told you at the first of the year whatever you got inside you let it out i don't care if it's bad at least you're letting it out get it out of you but if you got god inside of you give it to somebody else live your life like it's the last day you're going to be on earth what the prophet told us amen but let's give it away amen the very thing that we cherish so dear you get the new birth you'll want to give it away you'll want people to have what you have so bad amen because you see people that struggle and sure we struggle anyway as human beings we struggle we have strife and feelings and emotions and this and that and the other but there's one type post that'll help every one of us if you'll get born again like i said before it will not take away your problems but it will make your problems easier to handle now is that not true christian friends it won't take away your problems you think it's a flower bed of easy being a christian you're in bad shape that's right but it will help you handle all life situations jesus lord amen all of them i don't care you name one and god will help you do it but you've got to make the move to open that door to let him in you let him in he'll become the master of your house and being the master of your house he's perfect god bless you remember monica's sunday school class meeting the sanctuary at 12 40 to practice the song just keep us all in your prayers god bless you till we come back at two o'clock let's bow our heads to heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us for the opportunity we have lord to speak to your people now pray lord what's been spoken lord that they'll take it to the heart and lord it will become something lord that will will flower and that it will grow into a living plant lord inside of their body lord you want to inhabit us more than we want you to inhabit us lord i pray that we'll open our doors and even though we are born again christians we still have doors that we don't like to open but lord wait may we as this church be able to open those doors and let you come in and sup with us lord and commune and talk to us and tell us whether it be by the voice of the prophet messenger lord or whether it be the voice coming through from the bible that we read lord we it's just precious to be able to hear you talk to us lord the creator of all universe wants to talk to us lord thank you for that we pray that you should be with us sanctify us for this journey we meet back together at two o'clock lord we pray that you just bless each one keep the tiredness away lord and every lord be in our midst father we need you more than anything in the world bless us lord in jesus name we ask amen you're dismissed [Music] every time
