amen I hope we're done with all that cold weather and wet weather and Frozen weather it was a gentleman that worked the other day doing some doing some work for us and he's from Buffalo New York they had five feet of snow up there at the end of last year and he was showing me these pictures I got no desire to be there yeah they say that I had a great uncle always said that the best thing about the north was they had roads leading South that's made for as a whole different group of people that live in that in that part of the world I'm so thankful where we live but I thank the Lord for all his

all that I mean the doctors can only you know doctors can tell you what they can take you but I have a I have a better doctor I have I have one that has a Eternal prescription has an eternal diagnosis so you know they can tell us what's what takes place in this realm but there's another realm that we don't see that's eternal and that's the one we look to so if you have your Bibles we're going to look into First Peter chapter four you see here first one let's just all bow our heads we'll just speak to the author this evening our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for all your blessings on us and we just pray tonight that you just help us to get out of the way Lord that you can come speak through us and to us tonight and father for each need is in

for each one each hand that was raised Lord you know Lord they took something inside of a person to raise their hand to identify Lord I have a need and Lord before we ever ask or even acknowledge Lord you know what we have what we have need of and you already have the answer for us and we just thank you for that hello we just come tonight to claim what's ours the Lord has been gift freely given to us now tonight Lord we just come to freely receive what you have in store for us tonight anoint the ear Lord and the speaker tonight Lord that we can hear what you'd have for us tonight yes we pray for brother Wade or wherever he's at tonight Lord just continue to bless him in his ministry Lord and Bless the people there give him fruit for his labor we just ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen first Peter 4. verse 1 says for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revelings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riots speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use Hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister to the same one to another and as good stewards of the manifold grace of God if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things might be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praising Dominion forever and ever amen amen amen y'all can be seated Lord bless you bless the reading of the word this evening and they'll just pray for him but not take a little salt speak on the Oracles of God Peter speaks here in in chapter in chapter four just for a little background he says for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh all yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin and so we understand that Christ suffered for us and that he paid he died and he he paid the sin pavement he paid the price for us he freed us from sin and he said if we have if he has freed us from sin then Peter says for us to arm ourselves with the same knowledge that he that is um he has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that's right that's right so if Jesus as as Hebrews 4 tells us he said that he was tempted at all points as a man yet without sin so he he suffered but he overcame and John 16 he tells them he said you know that in in the war in me you have peace but in the world you have tribulation but he said he said but be of good cheer he said I have overcome the world so if you that if he's overcome the world then you and I are to overcome the world because we are supposed to arm ourselves with the same mind that he suffered as as all things but you know there's nothing that that he because he's our high priest so he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so he knows what we've been through and what we go through but you know he overcame and you know what we are able to overcome also why because he's made the way for us and Peter says to arm ourselves with this with this same mind the same mind that was in Christ Jesus and he says for that we no longer should live and the rest of this time in the flesh under the lust of men but to the will of God so when we're down here we're supposed to be living as until unto the will of God what the will of God is in and so we should do that's what our desire should be that we've overcome and we should be doing the will of God and he says for in the time passed you know we've lived as other Gentiles we we've lived in the old life and he said because you know it becomes strange to them that we don't walk in the same way that we used to live or the same ways we used to walk you know a lot of people say you know they say I'm saved I'm saved but you know the thing is is what were they saved from you know because you can't live the same life you used to and act the same way that you used to and say that I'm saved because you know what if if you were drowning and somebody come and pulled you up out of the River or the pond or whatever and they saved you then you would have a change they were to change take place you would be something that would be changed about you you would know there would be something that was drastically different amen and if you and I because you know what we were drowning in sin and you know what they never become a change in us because if you're drowning in sin because as the song said you know I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore so if I knew where I was and I know where I am today because I know what I've come up out of because I was drowning in sin but I know what God pulled me up out of and so I know where I'm at today and you know you're right they they should see a difference in us because people should look at us and see Jesus Christ they should see there's a difference we shouldn't walk like everybody else you know let's try to be religious I don't want to be religious the world is full of religion but I want to see the life of God I want I want people to know as they were in any other than when they saw those people they said they're just like Christ well if they can't see Christ in us then we need to go back to the Altar and get a hold of something that's real so that going on here and and Paul tells us how we ought to live or I'm sorry Peterson tells us how do we ought to live you know because he says the end of all things is a hand he said be there for sober and unto prayer well because that's one thing we ought to be looking for is a rapture we should be getting ready to get out of here nothing else should matter you know I see the world and the condition that it's in it makes me happy why because I know that's the condition the world is supposed to be in the prophet told us this place was going to fall apart and it's going to be prepared to be burned over well praise God that's what's happening the money in your pocket ain't no good yeah we have to live down here but it's not worth the paper that is printed on right and one of these days it won't be it won't be have anything won't be any value to us when it's all gone you can't take it with you you know the story is about the man that you know I've told it before about the man you know he wanted he wanted to take some of his riches with him and then when he got to when he got to heaven and and he wanted to take you God allowed him to take something with him and he took his gold and he went up there and Peter went and saw him at the gate and looked at him and said you brought pavement with you see because the things down here we have such a hold on and to have such a hold on us but see the thing is is when it's all gone you know all this stuff is all going to be burned off right you know your your car payments and your cars and all your clothes and all these different things that we worry about and these things you know if we just put these under the blood he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness he said that all these things will be added unto you if we put ourselves in the right place then God comes on the scene and he meets our needs he gives us what we have need of the old saying is God never turns us away empty unless we're full of ourselves right and so we need to make sure that we're empty of ourselves that he can come in and fill us but he says continuing he says every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God why because each one of us have a gift God God didn't call us and and just to be uh Benchwarmers have you ever have you ever found you ever found a place in the Army and it's called a benchwarmer there ain't there ain't no spot in the army of just people just sitting around if you're a soldier you know what they got a job for you it may be cooking it may be washing dishes but you're doing something they don't they don't just bring you in there just for you to stand around and look pretty there's there's a job that each one of them has so God has given us a gift and he said for each one of us to minister the same because we ought to be faithful in the in the job that God has called us to no matter what it is we ought to have the same faithfulness as anybody we shouldn't say well brother Dale has a bigger gift than or a greater gift than I do but no but we should be every one of us here should have the same dedication the same faithfulness to the gift that God has called us to as our pastor does and if we don't then we say well Lord help me because I need to be more faithful do I need to be more dedicated to what you've called me to I may not be able to do what everybody else can do but I'll be the same faithful right right it's just like when when you're in the Army when somebody or when you're on on the ball team or whatever you know you all got to play together you all got to work together each person has to is an integral part of the piece of the plan so each person has to do their part and if each person doesn't do their part then it collapses you say well I'm just a supply sergeant well you know what if all the guys fighting don't get supplies guess what there ain't no fighting going on maybe God calls us to pray but you know what we need to pray somebody's got to be doing some eating interceding right you know I was listening to brother Branham and he was talking about the meetings that he was talking about the success of his meetings and he was talking about those men they just sat on their faces laid on their faces all those days with them when they were preaching you know he was preaching in his and the healing was going on and those men and they were faithful to what God had laid on their heart to do to just stay before God in prayer and he said that's the success of my Ministry it'd be great but sometimes it's the people behind the scenes That You Don't See right you know we we think about sister media you know brother I'm talking about you know here I hear the angel the Lord comes to comes to brother random and speaks to him and you know he sees all these great things and he sees visions and he has all these things happen to him and he talks us about the Supernatural and you know his sister made and he said you know honor if there was any honor given to my family a ghost to her what she do washed his clothes ironed them she raised the kids he said she kept me from the public right and we say well you know we we put brother Branham up on this pedestal because you know what God called a woman to be with him right you know it we we we think that there's no there's no integral Parts but there is doesn't matter what your how small it is how minute it is it's if God called you to that then you have to be faithful to that and you are departed part there is no there's no there's no big eyes in little you we're all the same God calls us to do one part then we ought to do that he says if any man in verse 11 says if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things might be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion forever and ever amen so if we should speak he said we speak as the Oracles of God and we Minister Minister as the gift that God has given us and so we want to speak speak as the oracles and that's one of the things I want to look at tonight it's like what is it what is an oracle what is the Oracle of God and I have some definitions if the brothers will pull this up I don't uh there you go in Oracle so the agency or medium given a Divine communication or revelation it's a shrine or a place at which such responses were given any person or things serving as an agency of divine Communication in an utterance made or received as authoritative extremely wise or infallible yeah so he said we ought to speak as the Oracles of God right now when when you look at this I want to break it down into three different groups out of here that because this is very wordy but I want to break it down into three parts out of this yeah there's a person any person serving as an agency or an Avenue or as a channel right of divine communication exactly the first word that comes to mind is a prophet right right a place or something that's used for divine communication he's an utterance tongues and interpretation right prophecy inspiration of a song anything that God communicates through brother Branham says in the in the message spiritual food and due season this one this first one brother Branham says he says we find out Elijah could say that because the message of the hour in the word of God or the messenger the message and the Word was exactly the same thing the prophet the word the message messenger message and God was the same Jesus said if I do not the works that's written of me don't believe me that's good any man and his message is one he said that's why today that they do not believe in doing the works of God because they do not accept the message of God they don't believe the message so the message and the messenger are one the man in his message are one amen so we want to look at these these three types these three oracles that are in the scripture most of the time when you go to the Old Testament is where you're going to find the word oracles when you go to the Old Testament it gives you one one place and that place is the holy of holies and so one of the ones that I want to look at the place of the Holy Holy of the holy of holies and this is a scripture one of the scriptures that you'll find in the scripture First Kings 6 19 it says and the Oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord see you know that's where he's talking about is the holy of holies is where the Ark of the Covenant set so that was the oracle in Exodus 25 he says Thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon the ark and the Ark shall put and then the ark thou shall put the testimony that I give thee and there will I meet with thee in communion with thee from before the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee and commandment unto the children of Israel so when he said The Mercy Seat he said this is where I want to communion with you right as so we're speaking of the Oracle he said this is what I want to communion with you he said I want to communion with you before the word right you're going to have to come before the word that's where that's where the Shekinah Glory come down where the mercy was where The Mercy Seat was and he said this is where I want to meet with you but he said there was a divine a divine order given brother Brown talks about there was a divine order and we can go to the next one brother this is from and it fulfill us all righteousness and brother Brandon's speaking here and he was talking about how there was only one way for a man to go in and that was that he had to be cleaned and set aside right right God called God told Moses how to prepare Aaron to go into the holy of holies he couldn't go in just any way he had to be prepared right and brother Brandon said he said see let's go to 87 there brother scroll back down just a minute I put this one in there because he's I was going to read this scripture and it's already in the message I want to praise the Lord he said I want to read some scripture here to you for a moment Book of Exodus I think it's the 29th verse between that chapter rather begin at the first verse he said and Aaron and his son shall bring Thou shalt bring unto the door of the Tabernacle the congregation and washed them with water and thou shalt take the garments and put Aaron in the coat and the robe and the ephod and the ephod and the breastplate to gird him with the curious curious girdle of the ephod and thou shalt take the minor upon his head and upon the holy upon the holy crown upon the miter and thou shalt take the anointing o and pour it over the head and anoint him he said see Aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with water therefore when Jesus before he could be anointed our high priest he was washed with water and then and then not anointing oil port on him to anoint him like Aaron was anointed with oh he was anointed with the Holy Ghost for John bear records seeing the spirit of God descending like a dove and going upon him and the voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in and he continues on and he says well it's a beautiful type of us today as priest of God we must be first baptized confess our sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ washing away our sins and then you shall receive the anointing the gift of the Holy Ghost he said so a manner minister or any believer must first be washed from his sins in the name of Jesus Christ and then Anointed with the Holy Ghost to bring forth a testimony for God so there was a there was a divine order given for them to have access he said come before me but you couldn't come just anyway you had to follow the divine order that God gave them and you know he said it was death if you went in without following the prescription the directions that he gave him and he said you couldn't just come in at any time you wanted to you had to come in at the feast time when when the high priest was to bring the blood in before and sprinkle it on The Mercy Seat so there was a divine order given and he said and then you had to be first Aaron and his sons had to be washed so they had to be first you know first on we say realizing they had to be stripped of everything else everything that belonged to them had to be stripped away so it wasn't it was just Aaron standing there and in the washing took place by the prophet right so the prophet came and washed the high priest and then the the robes and the garments that were made just for this purpose was placed on him but it wasn't put on just in any order there was a divine order on how he was dressed and how everything took place and everything had its order and then when it all came together then after the the ephod and the crown was put on and then he was anointed right and then when the oil was poured upon him then he could approach The Mercy Seat but before that he couldn't and he said you and I are the same way we must be anointed so you just can't approach God anyway right it goes later on will see it become a there was a divine order given and you know brother random speaks of the of the pomegranates and the Bales on you know alone and you know even even the walk that the the high priest had going in to the the holy of holies there was a divine order to that right and so he had he had this everything that he done said holy holy holy unto the Lord so there was a divine order given for everything and you and I have that same divine order so will you come to the house of God you know we just don't approach approach it in any way see there's a reason that God has told us how to approach him even when we come to prayer you know people will say you know it amazes me that people sing that song Sweet Hour of Prayer for a lot of people it's unheard of all right you know some people some people say sweet hour a prayer they ain't got a prayer they ain't got an Hour of Prayer in the whole week pop right now and lay me down to sleep Lord help me don't get run over for y'all that left to go through Atlanta anyway you don't say Lord bless my feet food as I munch all this Stone but your other thing is why what's lacking is is because prayer is not just speaking to God prayer is is communing with God there was a communication that took place because you know when the high priest went into that when he went into the holy of holies he said when he sprinkled the blood there he was looking at the Shekinah Glory he was wanting to see that God accepted his his offering right he was deathly sincere because if God did not accept him and accept that blood then he was dead right so it was a death a deathly sincere walking and and going before him and sometimes you know we don't have that sincerity you know if we went in there then Lord you answer back to me I can speak to you but are you going to speak to me yeah one of the other things is speaking of the other the other thing that when you when you speak of an item or a thing or a place rather that you would uh see in the scripture is the is the urum and thumb you know it was the breastplate you know brother Brian said it was on a post it was on a temple in the in the uh on a post in the temple and you know and when the dreamers went before that and brother Branham says in uh and Christ Christ is same yesterday day and forever this is from 1956 and he says he says but now in the Old Testament there were three ways of knowing a message the first was the law the second was the prophet the third was a dreamer then they had a way of proving that whether it was exactly right or not and then he was talking about the he said in the air Nick or the levitical priesthood on Aaron's breastplate had 12 Stones and that's it and it's not exactly known by the scholars whether it was a reflection of The Twelve Stones together or a certain sacred light that when a prophet prophesied or a dreamer told his dream whatever it was and these Supernatural lights didn't flash on that that was called the armam thumb and then when the supernatural didn't flash to give witness to that well then it was wrong no matter how true the prophet was how real the dreamer was or whatever the Revelation was it had to be witnessed by the urham thumb if it wasn't it wasn't true he said but in this new priesthood the Bible is God's urham thumb and he said if a revelation comes a prophet prophesies a church is established a Doctrine is made and it don't flash on the Bible that it's wrong this is God's Urban it must be we must listen to the word right right and continuing on this is in the infallibility of the infallible uh word of God 1956 and brother Graham said God is under times and divers manner spoke to the prophets and to the children of the the children by the prophets but in this last day he spoke to us through his son Jesus Christ and this Bible is God's urham thumb and if a prophet prophesies a preacher preaches or if a dreamer dreams a dream or something that is not is done that don't flash on that Bible I just don't go for it that's all now when brother Brown was speaking of this when he's speaking of the urham thumb when they went before the urham thumb and they told their dream you know they didn't go in there and it wasn't some Ouija board that they went in front of you you know when they went before they went and you know people think well you know they just walked in there and the dreamer told his dream and all of a sudden boom there was a light but you know that was not the way it was when they went before that you know they sought God for an answer they looked for a supernatural happening a supernatural light in front of them they just didn't go in and say hey God there it is no they had to go stand in front of the arm thumb and they had to stand there and give their dream and they waited for God to give an answer right see people think well you know Lord you know even brother Branham talked about that you know when he was really heartbroken after after a sister hoping all of them passed away you know and he said you know I don't believe this being using this as a Luigi board but you know God spoke through him through that but you know there's no way it is when we open the scripture we lay in the scripture you lay in the word you just don't jump in there and you know Lord I'm gonna find what I need is there it is no sometimes you lay in the scripture you lay in the word you as Mary did you know she pondered these things in her heart because she had the word and she held it there until it was quick and to her because you know you have to stay in the word and lay in the word and people just think you know I'm just looking for a quick answer well that wasn't the way it was that's the way not the way God does it right so they had to stand there they say they had to be sincere when they went before there and they had to wait they would say that was a divine order given how they handled that so they had to be deathly deathly sincere when they went there and waited for God to give an answer to him that he would answer but if it's true they would answer he would give an answer to it and he said it didn't matter how real it was or or what took place or whoever it was whatever they spoke if it did not flash with the word then that Supernatural light didn't take right and there wasn't no Supernatural happening no light that flashed on it and many people have taken the word and they've had so many doctrines and so many ideas but you know what there's only one thing that can that you can bring through this Bible from Genesis to Revelation and that's a true revelation of God you know you're not going to get anything else as brother Adam said you can't get nothing else to the thinking man's filter because there's only one thing that's going to come through that and that's the word of God so we have to stay before God because you know I've held things many for many years in my life I had questions but you know I know God would give an answer don't know when it would take place but I held it before God and I got my answer you know for many years our heard people preach on the River Jordan and I've told this before you know our our dad and other other people said the same thing you know you hear that the first time sometimes you don't even know why but something just it just something hits you yeah yeah it is just like down inside of you and it's like I remember I remember the first time I ever heard somebody preach on that and I said Lord if that's the truth you'll have to show me that because I don't understand it I held that for a long time and understanding understanding how we how we come here with a seed in US I still remember I don't know if brother Dale remembers or not but we were sitting in his cough at his uh dining room table drinking coffee one morning I don't know if you remember that or not I was sitting there and he was the first time anybody broke that down and started showing me about receiving the word being the seed that's quickened to say I never heard anybody preach on the seed of predest uh seed of representation of predestination I'd never heard anybody speak on that before but you know what as soon as I heard something clicked inside of me and you know I could see things that brother Branham said made sense because people take things and you say well you know which see what seed is being quickened the seed that you came here with or the word that you heard you had to receive the word so if you don't receive if you don't receive the word as even the scripture talks about your brother speaking of you know when Peter preached her when Paul preached to the people when when they heard the word then when that took place then the Holy Ghost came and quickened the word to them right hold on I'm the air man is that on whoo we received a time out here maybe that'll help y'all everybody Fanning I'll run that won't happen everywhere um I'll have to get to that part of the message later where you know God changes changed his mask and he went from one to the other so I had to step I had to go into the other office of being the AC man right God knows all things but you know we stand here and so we go before God and sincerity and God gives us our answer right and you know when you when you say you what what how you how you came into into being just like just like that story about the little Eagle you know when something Rings true you know that's what you're always you've always been looking for the scripture says when when the Deep call it to the Deep see when there when there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond to that well because there's something that you're looking for and when you find it then you'll say that's what I've always been looking for and it's like thank God because there's something that fills me now well because there's a void there until that time and you're looking for something and when that void and then there's something that fits right perfectly and you say thank God that's what I've been looking for right sometimes you know brother random said in the message thirst he said the man was had a thirst inside him God put that thirst in him for God and he tries to fill it with everything else Under the Sun and they're looking for it and people have tried to dig and probe into the message and tried to come up with their own ideas but you know what they need to do is get before God and let him come and bring the word to him because that's what they're looking for but you know what they start running without a message yeah I just I just want to be you know I tell everybody you know that I'm just like a spare tire the Reason God made me look like the Michelin Man but that's all I want to be whatever whatever you know whatever little part that I've got that's what I want to be all right I don't you know because a lot of people you know they have it in their mind they have to be the best you know they want to be the top dog or you know the highest one everybody looks up to I don't want that yeah I don't have I don't have enough God didn't make me that way thank the Lord you know everybody gets worried about somebody else doing doing better I hope people do better than me I hope you know the Lord gives opens his word to a lot of people it's a lot more more than me Lord just open up the windows of heaven and pour it out on them right I don't want you know I don't want to ever get to the point where I feel like you know that that I'm uh envious of anybody because of what they have because he said he'd opened he's the only Divine revealer of the word and he'll give you the portion that you have need of now this the other one here will be going to is uh the other Oracle is a person a prophet a person within an infallible Authority or Commission one that God works through brother Brahm says here in in the message of seventh seal he said if there's a whole bunch of trumpets laying here and one of them had to sound out a certain music if the man them trumpets are perfectly mute it's the fella that can sound the trumpet that knows what he's going to do that picks up a trumpet the trumpet has nothing to do with it the sound comes from the intelligence behind it that's right so all trumpets are the same all men are the same all Christians are the same amen so we're perfectly mute when God calls us it's not what we do it's not what we can do it's what he does hey brain what he brings through us and so we're gonna continue here going to do a little go do a little reading here but you know you look at people in the scripture and this is this is one person that that really stood out to me without doing it I was doing some reading and it was it was the it's the prophet Michaela and the scripture says and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to Ramos Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall delivered into the king's hand and he said in the messenger that was gone to call Michaela spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word of them of one of them and speak that which is good and Michaela said as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak so he came unto the king and the King said unto him Michaela shall we go up go against Ramos Gilead or battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the King said unto him how many times shall I adjour Thee that thou shalt tell me nothing that which is true in the name of the Lord and he said I saw all Israel scattered under the hills of sheep that had no Shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did I not tell thee that he would Prosper he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil and he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord standing sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven is standing by him on his left right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Raymond Gilead and and one said on this manner and another said on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so now therefore behold the the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee but zedekiah the son of China went in there and smoked Michaela on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee and Michaela said behold Thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into and enter enter chamber to hide thyself and the king of Israel said take Makia and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city under the Jewish the King's son and say thus saith the king put this fella in the prison and feed him with bread of Affliction and with water Affliction till I come and Michaela said if Thou shalt if thou return at all in peace the Lord have not spoken to me and he said hearken old people every one of you I know there's a lengthy reading but but you know I I it really stands out to me a number of things that In this passage and you know when when the children of Israel when when God told Abraham Moses in the book of Deuteronomy when when Moses was told that he was not going into the promised land but he gave the words to the children of Israel before they went in and he prophesied to him and told him about the land that God had brought him to the place to carry him into the land and he said I'm you know I'm not going in but I've seen the land but he said God has promised y'all that land you're going to go in and possess it but he said you must hearken to the word of the Lord and you must stay there and you must follow it you must follow them and you must drive the inhabitants out because if you'd only drive them out see there'll be a problem unto you they will be Authority in your flesh for the rest of your life and and and God tells Moses later on he said these people he said when they go into that land he said they'll possess it he said but then they'll waxing fat and they'll get lazy and he said and then and then they'll turn away from me and break my Covenant he told Moses before he died what they were going to do when they went into that land and that they would not receive the word and you know what those people would be upon them as as a weight and a chain and a problem all of their lives yeah why because they wouldn't go in and they wouldn't destroy every single one of them so when God told him what was going to take place here here was that the word was given to them and they didn't go in and then we see how you go through the Kings and you know the children of Israel told Samuel that they wanted a king and he said you don't need a king but we want to be like everybody else we want to be like everybody else we want our King to rule over us and Samuel said have I not told you the word of the Lord that my entire life what have I done against you nothing you've been just what the word what you've done what the what the prophet that you were supposed to be you've been a blessing to us but we want to be like them he said you know what he's going to take your children from you he's going to take the best that you have and make it his yeah that's okay we want to be like everybody else the next thing you know they've got Saul and then they had David and Ed Solomon but then all of a sudden after that they start having all of the other ones you know Solomon was the was the great one but you know when he got old he got away from God because he looked because the scripture said he loves strange women and because he had had all these women he had a lot of children that didn't follow God he didn't instruct his children in the way that was true and what happened was his children came along and they took the throne and they built altars to Baal and they had Groves that they could that they could burn incense and all these things to all kinds of other gods and they didn't follow the word and what happened after that the next king was worse than the one before him the scripture says in the next one was worse than him before him and every time that they had one that was halfway decent they tried to follow the word and you have Josiah and the different ones that tried to raise up but you know there was only once but the scripture tells us every time one rose up they tried to follow the god it says but yet they never cut down the Grove see he tried to walk in the way that God had prepared of his fathers but the problem was he could never destroy what was around the people he might have tried to build it up but you know what that Grove was still there as a testament to the false gods and they still stood there and they still burned their incense and still altered their sacrifices and had their children walk through the coals not fire well they'd gotten away from it but you know what they still wanted to be called by his name they still wanted to have the blessings that God got bestowed upon Solomon and then when they come to this point you know Ahab comes along and you know here's here's a son Ahab and you know he sees that Ramos Gilead you know ramach Gillette was one of the cities that was given to him that was a uh one of the Cities of Refuge that God had put where the where the Slayer had innocently killed somebody that they could run to and it was a place that was given and Ahab said you know Ramos belongs to us we ought to go up and take it and he's asking about Jehoshaphat will you raise up with us and let's go take this from the syrians well you know what they wouldn't be in that mess in the first place if they'd followed the word but you know here it was they got messed up in all of this and they were wanting to go back and Jehoshaphat had no business being with him Eliot Elijah had already cursed Ahab because of taking naboth's Garden he'd already put put a curse on him and he said well can we find somebody that can prophesy we've got 400 saying take it it's ours president said they were all fundamentally right but he said Abraham wasn't right himself and I'll say oh yeah we can take that oh yeah we can do that God has given us us this land it's all of ours it's been ours but you can't walk away from God and and turn your back on what God has called you to do and expect you're going to claim the blessings of God and he said Michaela I want you to know you know he had one of them come up there and say Makanda we want you to say what all these other 400 are saying you better say this if you know what's good for you we got a lot of things we can bestow upon you if you can just say what the 400 say yeah and Michaela says I'm not going to say anything but what God tells me to speak but you know when he walks up there and Ahab will ask him and Jehoshaphat ask him say what does the Lord say what do you say Michaela he said go up go up and prosper the Lord's told you go ahead no wonder but I have gotten mad at him yeah he said how many times am I going to enjoy you to speak what God tells you to speak but see ahabit already made up his mind it didn't matter what what Michaela told him he was going to do whatever he wanted to right right and that's when he went up there and he told him he said look he said God they come and was speaking to God and he let a lying Spirit come to that 400 prophets and tell you what you wanted to hear and it's going to be your death and they didn't they didn't appreciate it but it was the truth many times people people they were they just want to go find somebody to tell them what they want to hear how does had a situation many years ago a young man was a young preacher and this and this lady had had something going on and she come to ask the pastor a question of a personal situation going on and he told her go ahead blew that preacher's mind that young preachers what I can't believe the Pastor said someone asked the pastor later he said brother that's what gets the prophet's message how could you tell her that I said brother she's been around all kind of different preachers asking about that same question everybody keeps telling her the same answer she's trying to find somebody to tell her he said it don't matter what I tell her she's going to go ahead and do what she wants to it and he said I just told her go ahead I didn't tell her it was right I just told her to go ahead because that's what she's going to do anyway and that's what Michaela told him listen you ain't gonna listen to me you got these 400 you got what you wanted you got your cheering section over here they're telling you go ahead so that's all you're going to do why are you asking my opinion people want people they got to justify everything that they do they gonna prop it up you know none of that's going to stand but that's what people do I want to be right with the word right so you know he told him he said listen he said go on up but he said I seen him scattered like sheep without a shepherd that you're going to die Ahab it's death but go ahead do what you want to you're not going to listen to me and you know they got mad at McKay and they put him in and took prison and you know said feed him the water reflection to the bread of Affliction until I return he said if you return it all God never spoke to me right right it was death but you know what they didn't listen but people are that way you can tell them what they what you want what you know because they're going to find somebody that's going to tickle their ears but that's not what God has called them what's called them too to receive that God has called us to receive the word whatever the word whatever the word does to us continuing on brother Adam speaking here and then another one you see a man as as McKay you know come and speak the word of God in a uh everybody against you but you know he stood there and said what what God laid on his heart to say and done what God wanted him to do and you know you look at ones that come and you know Michaela said all those Prophets they spoke of Christ they manifested Christ that was Christ being made manifest and you know we look at the Life of Christ and and you know brother Brandon was talking of of Christ you know he said here in uh we're gonna jump around here a little bit Saint John 5 19 he said then Jesus answered and said on there he said verily Mary I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise so he could only he could only do what God had called him to do he said for the father of the son and showing him all these things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that you may Marvel right right God so you know God called spoke to Jesus and we know we know it was God made manifest in another form but you know brother Dale was talking about the other day and I never did I never did find that quote Brethren never never mentions in in the message that uh he ever he ever sprinkled the human flesh on the theophany but brother Brandon did say this is in faithful Abraham this is this is where I where I got this from and bring that other faithful Abraham the quote up and brother Branham says when he's speaking of of Melchizedek coming he said it was God himself and two angels God himself and two angels in human form he said I often said someone said you don't mean that Bill yes I do I sure do God he said what we made of he said 16 elements of the Earth Cosmic light and petroleum and potash and calcium God just reached over and got him a handful of each went and stepped right into it said come here Gabriel puff get in here Michael and going to see what what's going on in Sodom Ben a lot of prayers coming up here I want to see what's going on and he moved out there and you know when when and the the point that what struck me was when brother renovus when you listen to brother random speaking this and he's speaking of of him coming down and he was coming to see meet with Abraham and he was coming in to step into flesh right you know he blew that he blew that 16 elements and when those 16 elements went forth he stepped into that yeah so when when they you see the when I was explaining about the sprinkling it was when he went like that then he stepped into that and then that human those 16 elements took the form of that theophany because when you go back and watch see what the the point that it struck me was I was reading and when you look at when it talks about Genesis 2 7 it says and God formed the Man Out of the Dust to the Earth you go back to Genesis is where it talks about that Aaron CR he he fashioned took a fashion until and he fashioned the golden calf and it's the same word because when you go back when he when they took the earrings well he took their earrings and their gold and he put it into the fire it had no form the goat had no form it was a mass of gold there and he went in and he formed that to make that calf so it took on the Creator was Aaron he took the toll and he formed that goal to look like he wanted he wanted it to so when when when Genesis 2 7 when the flesh came he took on the form that God had in his mind which was that theophany so when when brother Branham step you know speaking of him stepping out there that he stood there and he spoke to Abraham and he ate that calf and he ministered to him and then when he went to went to Paradise when when he was in paradise and Abraham saw Jesus there he said that's the one we fed the calf to why because he took on that form he said we no longer see Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ so that form was there so when when the logos came forth it wasn't it wasn't some part you know like like it was like something was lost it was just another manifestation of himself so when you when he came forth it wasn't that he that you know he he was different he was manifesting himself that he would that that he could be seen in a greater Realm see people people sometimes they they try to make this thing like it like he's trying to uh confuse people no he stepped forth to make himself known and people people get confused I don't I don't know but I see that more that when when you can't you can't eliminate God you can't decrease God something that's infinite that has that has no bounds and yet it has a form that looks like you and I so when he stood there and he said he said A Part went out from him well if he's infinite he's Limitless it don't matter how many times he expanded or went out it didn't change who he was so when all God was he poured into Christ he didn't he didn't do away with God right right the father's still there so when the son came forth the logos it didn't change who he was because when you take something that's infinite because of what and when you when you look at something that has no bounds it has no ends you can't you know like I always say you know if you take infinity and you cut it in half what do you have you still got Infinity you can't you can't say well you know this is this is this is the left Infinity that's the right Infinity no it's still Infinity right you know most people of mine you know you look we say well how many numbers fall between one and two I've asked this question many times and I'm gonna ask it again and I know I confuse some people but uh hopefully I'll keep saying it to you I'll figure it out the Lord will show it to you rather any more how many numbers fall between one and two they say there's no numbers between one and two so one and a half is not a number one and three quarters is not a number one one in one thousandths not a number one in one fifty thousands is not a number one in one Mega that's not a number so let's keep going how many numbers can you put between one and two yeah there's an infinite set of numbers in between one and two I can divide I can divide one into give me some you know one you can divide as many times you want to I can just sit there and keep dividing dividing you give me any number I can divide it in half it just keeps on dividing so we say well we have a portion of him but if you've got a part of him then guess what you're infinite too right because if he's Eternal and you and he's giving you a person a part of that eternal life that eternity and that's what makes you it makes you Eternal it doesn't matter how small that part is if it's a part of God that you've received then guess what it's eternal you can't you can't diminish it because he didn't become diminished because he gave us something because he made itself known but it was when in the beginning all that he was back there he is today all that God was he poured into Christ well he didn't lose nobody right right so they didn't disappear all that Christ was he poured into the church see some some of these one of these days I know right dad's going to get to it one of these days we're going to see who we are right right because if brother Branham said all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the believer right when we see who we are then we're exactly who he is right we've not we've not diminished right see sometimes the only the only limit that we really have in in in who we are through Christ is the limit so we put on ourselves that's that's the limit that we have because we say well there's a part there's you know that peace we we received our portion we've received the seed you know all these we try to look at it almost like it's minute or some kind of little piece yeah and we understand the little peace the part that we receive it's more than enough but sometimes we don't see we we try to we try to limit ourselves because if you see who and and I I tell you I don't I don't see it all but I say enough because I when I say that I see greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world why because I have my I have my portion and that's enough I know that I know God will reveal more to me but in what he started with in the beginning is what's going to carry me on because I'm just going to be adding to that or it's going to become manifest it's going to continue to grow and you know and sometimes we look at words like like growing it's not it's not like God is getting bigger because if he's infinite then he's not getting bigger because he's infinite so he's not growing but it becomes more real to us we're growing in him we see more of him we manifest more of him so it's not that he's changing we're changing so the changing is taking place in us because we're becoming more like him foreign part of what you what you're preaching on that's what I see anyway because I want I see because if God ever given me a part of him then that's the part that God wanted me to have and that's what I'm going to manifest and there's more of him revealing himself because if you make it to Faith then it's this what was that faith is continuing it's more of him making a new manifest in us he's growing in US so when we're adding to that we're adding not not in a not in a physical or you know as we think of it we're trying to add to but it's that is growing or making more manifest so when we're adding to that there's more of God to be made known to us to make us a full stature of Jesus Christ I thank God because you know a lot of people don't see that and a lot of people you know I thank God for brother Wade and him bringing the messages that he did because you know there's there's so many things that you can that you see and a lot of people you know you realize a lot of people have never heard that in their entire life exactly right A lot of people you know the message has has been more has been published more and and made more available today than it ever has in in the entire history of the of the brother random's Ministry and you know people understand it more at least now than any other time we got more people confused about what he's saying and I'm just so thankful that God has given us a Ministry to bring us to that place because you know we we can't all we can't do it ourselves right no man's an island right and he gave us a five-fold Ministry and each each person brings their part in and you receive from that fivefold Ministry because it's not it's not one person it's him so when when we receive that word we're gonna go to skip down to brother I'm sending a message the perim in church age he said now then this word has left behind on the printed Pages a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said his word was life John 6 63 says but that is exactly what is John 14 6 says I am the way the truth and life Romans 8 9 be says if any man have not the spirit of Christ he has none of his there it is he is spirit and his life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every man has to go Satan cannot stand before that man amen so we've received that if we received the word and he said and he says if we speak the word a Spirit-filled child of God speaks a word he said it's the same as him speaking he said it's deity speaking why because it's it's not us speaking but it's him if we speak the word he said if if you say unto this mountain because if it's the father speaking through you then it'll take place he said he said ask that your joy might be full he said he said we do not have he said you have not because you ask not right because why because you know he said you know if we want little things then ask God for little things but if you want big things then ask God for big things you know I've got I've got you know my boys they don't they don't mind asking me for anything and I understand as they get older it gets worse oh it gets better more expensive that's what I hear it gets more expensive but you know they don't mind asking and asking and asking and asking when they get tired of asking me they'll ask their mom you know I ask and ask The Book of Luke I think it's chapter 11 there he said you know if if you if your son asks for a fish he said well you give him a serpent he said if he asks for bread would you give him a stone he said he said if you being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give unto them that ask him he said he said how much more will he give the other other scripture says how much more will they give of the Holy Ghost to them that ask him right right so he said ask ask and you shall receive but you know we say well what we should come as as the faith of a child well you know they don't mind asking right you know they can get in trouble and you know you're just ready to uh I always like to say I like anyway I want to get a hold of them but you know what they don't mind they get you can get you know they just get under your skin you just like I know you don't have that problem y'all pray for me I know y'all don't know about anything about that but but you know and then they turn around and you know a little bit later they come right back to you they love on you right and you know what you know it's just it it goes right past and you know and they come right back and they don't mind asking for something and you know what if they if they need something they know where to go right right but you know sometimes we don't have we don't we get wrapped up in ourselves and we get Bound by things because the devil put things in our minds and we don't we won't go before the father they say Daddy I got a problem you know I remember I like talking about Richard every now and then people might forget he's my brother but you know Richard had a problem one time and and you know he was he was so afraid that he was that he had to go tell Mom and Daddy always outside he was shaking like a leaf and he's like well I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't want them on there I'm just I'm just I'm just a nervous wreck and you know what I done that's it come on got a hold of him drug him in the house mom and dad was in the bed I would woke him up he said you need to come to the living room we come in the living room I said well listen you can tell them the problem or I'm going to tell the problem but the thing is is they're going to find out tonight and you know what he told them but you don't want to come to find out it wasn't near as bad as he thought it was going to be but you know what he was such a nervous wreck because in his mind he had already knew how things was going to play out but you know what we have an intercessor we need somebody to intercede for us why because you know sometimes we get wrapped up in ourselves that the Holy Ghost intercedes on our behalf because we don't know what's going on because sometimes we can't pray we don't know how to handle the situation but you know we have one that intercedes for us just the same way that takes over the in the situation that will intercede for you on your behalf and give you what you have native who will come and meet your need right right but you know the thing is is we we get wrapped up but you know God is here to meet our need is mindful of us if we come before him and you know We Lay ourselves before God he'll come and he'll meet our need and he'll give us what we have need of all right and then we'll the the third the third one in the in the Oracles of speaking of the oracles the first one was was the was the place the second one was was the was the person that God's that God uses to speak through in the second one and this in the third one I want to speak up is the is the is the message or the utterance that God gives or the response that God gives and the the person that that stands out to me in in this situation is is David when David was rejected as king and he was overthrown and he was run out and and a second and second Samuel here in the 16th chapter he says and when King David came to baharam behold fence came out a man of the family of the House of Saul whose name was shimai the son of Guerra he came forth and cursed steel as he came and he cast stones at David and all and all the Servants of King David and all the people of the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left and thus said Shema when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belly hell he said the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Saul and who stead thou Hast reigned and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son and behold Thou Art taken in thy Mischief because thou art a bloody man then said abishay the son of zerua and to the king why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray then take off his head and the King said why have I to do with ye you sons of zerua so let him curse because the Lord hath said unto him curse David who shall say then wherefore hast thou done so and David said unto abishay and all this service behold my son which came forth of my bowel seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the Lord hath bit in him and it may be that the Lord will look upon my Affliction and that the Lord will Christ me good for this cursing this day and as David and his men went by the way Shema went along on the hillside against over against him cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust and brother Brando says in in the message of Statuary of a perfect man he said and he and his own people turned him off and throw things at him spit at him and made fun of him as he started up the hill and he was rejected he said oh how perfect the Son of God 800 years later rejected king among his own people sat on the the mountain wept over Jerusalem as a rejected King what was it God reflecting himself in those prophets reflecting Christ now there's a few things that you know when you look at when you look at David and and this In this passage of scripture well and you know most of us know that know the story but you know what what stands out to me is that when when David was overthrown it was because of his own his own sin caused him to be overthrown by his own family and when when he was overthrown and he was and he was run out and Absalom took over the kingdom and then when she and I come out and cursed him you know he stands out there and and he says he could you know he first calls him and he says you're the man of belly ill which if you if you know that that is a false god so and so you know you don't even serve you don't even serve God you're the Antichrist he said he said in the Lord hath have returned unto thee all the blood of the house the salt see the thing is is he comes out and he accuses David of running of ruining Saul and running Saul off the throne but you know it wasn't it wasn't David that run Saul off the throne it was it was his incomplete obedience to the word that took him off the throne and when he went out there Samuel told Saul he said he said you know God is today has rent this the uh when when Saul grabbed a hold of his of Samuel's garment and he ripped it he said and God is the Kingdom from you today and given one who's better than you are and has given him the kingdom and you know anointed David to be the king but you know it was it was not anything that God that David had done God had taken away from him because what Samuel I mean what Saul had done of his own accord and then when all these things had taken place and he said you know because of the Mischief that you've done he hadn't done anything Saul was the one that tried to kill David multiple times you know we we know that you know even the even his his men told David he went down there and he cut off part of uh Saul's garment and he walked away and you know the scripture says that he was struck by that and he said he he was guilty by that and he called back to Saul and he told him he said my Lord he said I've cut off your garment it broke his heart that he done that but he said you know I want you to know he said I could have taken your life but I didn't he said you know they were there were men they were in my ear telling me to take your life and I didn't and he went out there and he told him said look here they were accusing him of ruining sawing and running him off the throne and now he said now you know the same thing that you've done to Saul was happening to you your sons run you off the throne and you know abishay says Lord let me just go out there and cut his head off he's he's a dead dog he's worthless they said no he said the Lord has told him to do that the Lord has told him to curse and he said and in the verse scripture he said that that it may be that the Lord will look upon my affliction and that the Lord will require me good for this cursing this day and you know it was very low that he had to walk out of there rejected that he would that he was rejected of the people and there he was and he was facing this and it was it was very difficult when was the last time somebody threw stones at you sometimes that people say things about us sticks and stones or break your bones but words won't ever hurt you but that's not always the way it goes but he says you know the Lord will look upon this he said God told him to curse me he didn't do anything and he walked on and brother Brown you know speaking there was Christ rejected he said how would I've covered you with my wings he said I would have drawn you to myself and he said but y'all rejected y'all didn't want it you know he weeped over Jerusalem first Thessalonians 1 5 says for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power in the Holy Ghost and much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you have become followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost say it's not always easy because there's a joy of receiving the word but it comes with it with a heart with Affliction with hardness there's a hard way to go and then and then in scripture you know we know a few chapters later and and in second Samuel 19 when it continues on and and you know he comes back and we try to say save some of the reading and he says it's so King he said so the king returned and came to Jordan and Judah came to Hugo to go meet the king to conduct the king over Jordan and Shema the son of Garrow benjamite who was of borua cast down hasted and came down with the man of Judah to meet King David after he had been restored to the throne and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him and zebra the servant of the House of Saul and his 15 sons and 20 servants with him and they went over Jordan before the before the king and they went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household and do what he what he thought good and Shema the king the son of Gareth fell down before the king as he come over Jordan and said unto the king let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to heart for that servant doth know that I have sinned therefore behold I am come the the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my Lord the king but abishay now this is but abishay the son of zerua said answered and said shall not sham I be put to death for this because he cursed the Lord's anointed and David said what have I to do with you you sons of zarua that you should do this that you should be adversaries unto me there shall shall there any man be put to death This Day in Israel for for do not I know that I am this day King over Israel therefore the king said unto Shema Thou shalt not die and the King swear unto him it really struck me you know so when when Shema went out there and he cursed David but when he saw that he was coming back he run out there to David's feet and he bowed down and he said Lord don't bring your money don't remember my iniquity unto me again unto this day he said because he said I was one of the first ones when I saw you coming back I went right out to meet you I didn't want you to come on there and try and look for me and find me some other time I wanted to meet you on your way back in because I didn't want this to be over my head those same ones that that they saw and and abishay was standing there and he said let's just go ahead and kill him when they saw because you know what he cursed us he threw rocks at us as we walked out of Jerusalem and he come back and said no God told him to do that and David said no he said you won't die today and swear unto him yeah when he saw the things that they had done he did not remember his iniquity even though he should have Abby Shea said how can somebody curse God's anointed and live he said no God called him to do that brother Brown says in the message a man running from the presence says and remember we're going to have to answer for it remember those who spent on Christ's answer for when David returned back from Exile he was a fugitive when he returned back and remember His fellow fell on his face and cried out for Mercy spit on David going out but he almost was ready to bathe his feet with tears when he came back and someday those who Pierce Jesus will see it and those who are piercing him today will see it also they someday they'll come back or revelation 22 he requires us to keep every word that was written every word Romans 14 11 says for it is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord infest tongue confessed to God that he that he is Lord that they they have turned their back on him right and you know what we know that that some that God has Mercy on people will be amazed on the day of judgment who receives eternal life and who doesn't you know as he said there's those ones they may not have wanted God had anything to do with him but you know he said unto him he said you saw me naked and you clothed me you saw me hungry and you fed me he said all those things that that they done to him and he said he said when did window when we do these things to you he said when you've done it under the least to these my brethren he said you've done it unto me you know there's there's people that's going to receive eternal life they may not wanted to have anything to do with God but maybe there's a way that they receive eternal life and people people and and you you look at the Jews they went out there and said let his blood be on our hands and our children's those being blinded that you and I can see right we're a blessed people that those people that have turned him down and rejected him that the Gentiles can come in the dogs can come in that he can that we can receive what they've what they've lost I thank God for that right that there's a there's a group out there that's going to receive eternal life because what God done right all right you said go ahead let's all stand how the musicians come I'm so glad that God has been so so wonderful to us the message the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said and God will never speak to the church until he comes back to until it comes back to the oracles and principles that God laid down it's not dominated by some emotional or some denomination to put this in that way it'll have to come back in believing Miracles believing in signs believing in the Holy Ghost baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and all these things will have to come back to that God wants or God won't speak to them right that's right brother Brown says in the speaking of in the laodicean church age he says but what is in the mouth of the Lord he said the word is in his mouth said Matthew 4 4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he said the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church the word he said first Peter 4 11 If any man speak let him speak as the oracles or the word of God the message from and this is from message things that are to be brother Brown says now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creator denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so we're to be that Oracle the word made flesh that we can be the living Tabernacle the Living God you know the scripture says take no thought what you'll say he said it'll be given to you what percentage God is taking resonance here to manifest it to the world because the world is see is is looking for reality yeah they spend a lot of time talking about reality everything is reality to now but they're missing reality but God said that he was going to make make this word known to the world has it as Peter told us it was going to be preached the best sermon ever preached is a life lived they're going to see this word and they'll be judged by it but some will receive it and some won't right but I thank God for what he's given us amen let's sing that little song I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to live I want to give until there's just no more to give if you haven't need this evening
