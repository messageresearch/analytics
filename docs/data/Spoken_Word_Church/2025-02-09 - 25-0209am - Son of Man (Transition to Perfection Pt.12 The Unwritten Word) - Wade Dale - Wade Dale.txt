we're going to um ask brother Aaron if he would if he would like to make his way oh you're behind me here so I think he has a couple of specials here this morning so amen God bless you you can tell when brother Ryan uses this this morning I I've had a song on my heart for a little while um the song's probably 40 years old I'm guessing uh first heard it when I was a kid and uh just come back to me recently and uh it really something to me it speaks to my heart and I hope it's a blessing to you and I was going to sing it Wednesday night but uh I just didn't feel that was the time to do it but I had it on my heart this morning I was like Lord if I get asked to sing I know brother Joe had asked about somebody singing this morning I was like well if nobody says anything nobody has is on the list then I'm going to sing this song and I come through the door downstairs and first thing when I sing brother Wade first thinging he said can you sing this morning and so he said sing Paul and Silas so I'm G to sing Paul and Silas but I want to sing this song first this has been on my heart and uh but uh this goes along with this song uh this man had a wrote it about a testimony that he had and it goes along with the with the message doors and doors and you know there's a lot of doors in our lives the Lord wants to open for us and that's what this that's what this song's about a heart is like a house one day I let the savior in there there are many rooms that we would visit now and then but then one day he saw that door I knew the day had come too soon I said Jesus I'm not ready for us to visit in that room go as the place in my heart where even I don't [Music] go I have some things hidden there I don't want no one to know but he handed me the king with tears of Love on his face he said I want to make you clean let me go in your secret place then I opened up the door and as the two of us walked in I was so ashamed as light revealed my hidden s but when I think about that room now I'm not afraid anymore because I know my my hidden sin no longer hides behind that door that was the place in my heart where even I wouldn't go I had some things hidden there I didn't want no one to know but he handed me the key with tears of Love on his face and he made me clean I let him in my secret place is there a place in your heart where even you don't go [Music] [Applause] I'm so glad he's got the key amen there's lots of things that we have hidden in our lives that we but thank God he comes the word comes amen discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart let's sing you've heard

in the house of the Lord Give the Lord one more hand clap of Praise amen I told him I said brother aon's lost so much weight brother Joe couldn't even find him he said oh he's back here maybe that's maybe that's how we we need to have a plan on Sunday we'll just keep doing that worship like that and we'll uh we'll get out of here in a little while amen good job good job to the Lord for coming among us and being uh that's why I like worship the words the word number one but you got to know what you're worshiping about that's true but you can worship when you find out that you're in the truth of the hour there's no other truth no other way we're the only people that know who Jesus really is and he walked in here with you today right there in your heart and you're the mystery that's going to be unfolded in the end time is God in your flesh good to be in the house of the Lord we've had some church so let's have a little bit more Brother Louis will be speaking for us Wednesday night uh today after the service if you brought your lunch that's okay you can sit and eat your lunch if you want to stay with us we're going to probably uh the sewing class and a knitting class will be downstairs with sister Jun sister Lily and then the cooking class will go on obviously in the kitchen area and it will be uh breakfast if you want to wait till about 3:30 we'll have stuff to eat biscuits gravy um grits sausage bacon and such and we'll make may make an omelet or two show you brother how to make an omelette spiritual food first then we'll get to the Natural Food but that's what's going on if you but if you did bring something you want to eat about it when we get finished that's fine you do that and then we'll start right into the uh to the class so God bless you thank you so much for U for signing up for all these things uh the sign up sheets downstairs now for anyone that's interested in taking archery um basic archery and also a gun safety course now I told uh somebody in the back I said their sisters signing up for the gun class yeah no it's scary yeah June was one of them she's always wanted to learn how to and and you know what to protect yourself am uh and not and not harm yourself it's good to know how to handle a gun and know what it's for so we're going to sign up downstairs the dates are tentative they may change a little bit but the gun safety archery are downstairs if you want to sign up for that also as brother Ryan was talking about those meeting sheets the special meetings that we have that are that are set in stone they're back there as you go outside to pick up and take with you all the way down to Christmas at the end of the year if the Lord carries I want you to know that cuz sometimes you we can make our vacations around it or um make arrangements this coming weekend I want you to look around there's about 95 people sitting in this place there's 22 more people coming next Sunday so don't y'all lay out but we got to make space for 22 more people that are definitely coming from Brother burley's church and from the whole Ohio group is coming that are that are husband and wife okay so they will be here with us they'll be getting here on Friday just to let you know they'll be here on Friday they're they're going to be staying at Mom's house and my house cuz they're all coming in one van I want want you to really um pray for sister Tabitha's parents uh their name is Frank and Sylvia they are just a hoot to be around you will laugh yourself to death but they they they threw sister Tabitha out when she was young when she accepted the message they threw her out of the house that's how much they they're Catholics but I think since they met some of us all through the past two three years they have softened up a little bit about that and they they have had lengthy discussions with some of your sisters and I I don't want us to put on the dog I want us to just be Christian I want us to greet them uh Sylvia um she's she I don't know what she's going to wear but I don't care I don't care they need to see Christians and uh and they're coming and that's a that's a miracle in itself that they're coming so they'll be here too also and like I said we'll all be staying at Mom and Dad's now um and they're leaving early Monday morning so we'll be able to Sunday when we're here next Sunday we're going to stay here instead of going somewhere to try to eat with all the people we're going to stay here and fix what we can we'll eat what's left over from the banquet we'll do something here so we can all Fellowship together cuz they want to come and fellowship and uh and they want to uh they want to be around us all they can and we sure appreciate the the Ohio group and love them with a love of the Lord so now today we won't add any more for the banquet if you got somebody that's coming you need to call them today and if they say I don't know that's a no because we've got to get the caterer has got to know how many people to feed uh sister Anna and different ones that are doing we're doing games and prizes through the whole thing we're not going to do the um New LED game because we got so many people it'll take so long but we're going to add some extra games in that you'll really joy and also um for the sisters that are widows sisters that are widows are you with me that have husbands that are passed away or wives the church has got you a little something and it'll be a surprise and you're going to get it in the mail within the week so we decided to do something because U we sure I don't like to be left out yeah and it's Valentine's Day and some of you lost your Valentine and and I I ha that but God's the one that can comfort you I can't God's the one that can give you the greatest gift there is and that's his love his love you know Paul told us one time in the Bible he said it's better that you don't marry right didn't he say that he said it's better that you don't marry because when you marry you got to focus on this and that and the other well that's okay we all got married cuz obviously we all got married and obviously your Mom and Daddy got married and here you are so that's uh not something to be ashamed of but when you are single sometimes it's it's hard and we see it with with Mom with dad passing and we we sure do uh should do miss him and U but we appreciate God giving us a standard he give us the word of God if we have a problem go right straight to the word of God Amen so we're going to go there today and and today we're going to talk about a little bit about the unwritten word because the words here in your Bible the words been spoken by different people Luther Wesley all the way down we've got volumes that are spoken by Spurgeon and different ones but there was a time that God wrote his word in secret he give them the printed word but there's an Unwritten word it's not a different word it's the same word revealed or with a deeper understanding or a perfection because man today I said before man in in 13,000 different denominations most of them will open this same Bible and preach their Doctrine out of it okay but somebody's got to be right that's why God sent us a prophet he sent us a prophet to tell us this is the right thing and we got to believe that I believe that because it it it mirrors with Jesus Christ and what was in the Bible it doesn't mirror with his Humanity faults and failures we all got them amen but the word of God he spoke was the truth and we U appreciate God you know giving us the opportunity so let's go to First Corinthians and then we'll then we'll pray but as written iath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us there's a promise by his spirit for the spirit searches all things y the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received now here's the thing God told us you've received it what are you going to do with it now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God Revelations 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth there was something revealed that previously was not we're going to live on this Earth that's a mystery a new Heaven and new earth for the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea sorry Louise got too fast and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared what as a bride so he saw the bride the city was the bride the bride was the city and that's what was coming down was not building skyscrapers roads Gardens no it was people amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day forgive us of our sins be with us and further in this service father thank you for for bringing us uh freedom of the spirit Lord today father I pray that that would be something that would that would not be strange anymore Lord that we would uh the spirit strikes and we just take off amen father I pray that you'd bless us now in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated but just remember next Sunday really uh need to make space for the people that are coming and uh we sure do appreciate each and every one of you amen Matthew 17:1 we're going to get to something here in just a second and Jesus answered and said unto them El lies truly shall first come and restore all things so you and I are today sitting in a restoration message we're not a Reformation message a Reformation message would be just to reform you and then all of a sudden you may become unreformed hello we've seen that many times with alcoholics and different things but if you get the new birth in your soul you won't ever do those things again right amen that will not come I mean hey the Temptation listen I I had a question here and I want to kind of touch on it just a second a a person wrote said there's a bunch of evidence to prove the message is right and ultimately because I have faith that God sent a prophet but sometimes I get these in intrusive thoughts of what if everybody raise your hand we all do we all do we all get those questions of what if what if this is not right what if this is this what if this is that what if we missed it and it's supposed to be for the Baptist right you got to take it back to the word of God do the Baptist believe in a trinity yes do you no does the Baptist believe in water baptism name father son Holy Ghost and they'll fight you for it yes do we believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only correct baptism yes so guess what there's all the Whata ifs but here's your answer all right here's your answer is in the word of God the answer is that we have been restored back not reformed back but restored back to the faith of the fathers which was the original teaching of the disciples right after Jesus left so it was all real fresh in their heart I mean Jesus left and just a few days later the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost and boom there they are and they and then everything that was in their life was quickened everything that Jesus had said was quickened remember there was no Bible but there was some Mysteries remember Jesus and we'll not read it today but I got it for later Jesus said I'm speaking to you in Parables and they said we don't understand these things he said I don't want in other words it's just just 2025 I don't want all them to understand it right I I want you to understand it I want my children to be able to understand it God's children to be able to understand what I'm talking about the Pharisees obviously didn't they killed him for what he said all right and all the disciples except for one got killed for what he said amen nobody survived except one John was the only one that survived every one of them was killed so if you got a mixed emotions it's the Devil he's a liar amen that's right and if you want to say you know what I'd say what if too I'd say what I'd say I'd ask him i' say devil what if it is righten that's I think the Bible will prove that uh you're not going to make it and the Bible proves that I'm going to make it there's no way for you to make it devil you've done so your soul you've done give everything away you had a position in a place but God's give us a position in a place so if that what if comes it comes to everybody we all do we all question things take it back to the word amen take it back to the word of God the word of God will always correct the error always all right everybody with me amen and then if you don't understand something just keep just keep plugging along keep plugging along it it's going to be that you know when I was 12 13 14 years old and I I didn't have the the new birth but I understood a little bit of the Bible I understood I understood enough of the message of the hour to know that it was true but Paul said you can know all Mysteries and not have charity and be what a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and you're going to go to hell if you're not born again you know so you can come up here and you can preach all the great Mysteries if you want to but there's a certain point that God's going to not let you go any further cuz the devil can go listen can he not quote the Bible can he not pass out spiritual gifts can he not preach but he can't reveal the word of God I'm saying listen he can't reveal the true word of God to us because everything he brings us has to be false now have some truth but somewhere it's got to be false I was listening yesterday at a commentator on radio he said U my kids always said I want to be free you know I want to get away I want to be free I want to get out of this message thing I want to get out of there I Want to Be Free he said well he said you know if you take a a locomotive several hundred th000 pounds full locomotive and you set it free take that big old train that comes down through here all the time and set it free no tracks what a disaster it would be there has to be some stability in life CA train tracks to keep you and you say well and the conductor is saying praise the lord it's there I don't want to be free to go through the woods or go through somebody's house or go through the I want to have some kind of structure so you and I must have some kind of structure that's why we need to teach our kids the truth show them the truth number one you don't have to teach it to them show it to them cuz they'll watch you they watch it all of us so let's continue on so we know that we're we're in a restoration message so let's go to First Corinthians 2:7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery now this is Paul telling the Corinthians but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom now Paul calls it hidden wisdom knowledge which God ordained before the world unto our Glory yes sir he didn't say God's glory he said our Glory listen you and I are the glory of God brother Bown said you and I we're the victory Of God we're the we're the thing that God's looking for we're the thing that that Satan don't know anything about cuz he can't be us he can try but he can't be us right when the spirit of God fell a few minutes ago that wasn't a devil in that no no that was God that was God and and the devil you know what he done he I hope he got plastered up against that wall and sent out the door but he didn't you know what he done he come right back into to them but that's okay and that's where you get the what if it's okay it's okay to question but the answer is in the Bible the answer is the prophet message the answer is in the fivefold ministry cuz there the five-fold ministry is given to us to perfect us that are sitting here today yes sir from here back Matthew 13 said he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you now we're talking about the unwritten word because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given so you and I have an unfold we have an Unwritten word like I said before the other day our conversation if we were to go sit down and sit down in front of a and have a we do we have Baptist friends we have Methodist friends it's not bad to have friends that are not in the message sometime excuse me that sometimes that kind of keeps you checked up and let you know what you really believe because they some of them know the scriptures pretty well but you better know them too but the problem is is they know their tradition they know their Dogma they know their Creed you and I know no Creed but Christen as brother Brown said no law but love no book but the Bible but you can sit and talk to them and we can me and brother Aaron can talk about the word of God what happened in the garden and different things people sit around you and they're like I don't understand that right now why don't they because of misinterpreted Theology of what they believe now I'm talking about Christian so nominal Christians and we all got the friends that are like that and most of the time that you'll start talking about something they'll go oh really it don't happen to you you give them something strong enough and they'll go or they won't go this they'll go I think I need to why because the two Spirits Clash not the person the person may love you and I I have some denominational people that I love them they're good to be around but when you start talking word to them that's where the two Spirits that's where there's an Unwritten word that they've never seen before you and I have seen exactly what we've seen exactly what's in God's mind nothing different exactly it come from God that's right that's our privilege he's only going to tell the secrets to his people Romans 16 verse 25 now the himym that is of power to establish you according to what my gospel Paul said and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began amen but now but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of faith we had a Prophet come in the end time why the prophet have to come because a prophet hears directly from God Amen he doesn't take anybody else's opinion he hears directly from God now listen let's just be frank brother ramam had his own opinion brother mam had his own opinion but God corrected it now I don't have it here I got it back there in the in the room where brother R was talking about these Hidden Mysteries I'm not bringing it today but he said these things were not right until the seals open that's the unwritten word that was part of God that now he's unfolded in the end time couldn't open the seals to nobody else but us right so the revelation of Jesus Christ now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means the unveiling so the Book of Revelations is what the unveiling of God but remember it's not also the unveiling of God is the unveiling of me and you what brother BR what brother brother brownan what brother Dale tell us that the re Book of Revelations it's the bride's book it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and a group of people all right this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of stat of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker remember the statue was already there right the stat was always there but after the master sculptor got finished you know knocking all the the rough P pieces off of it and shining it up he hid it it's still there but it was hid from the world and then it was what it was unveiled it's an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden so that's what we're getting into that's why we're this transition to Perfection is is there's not any error in the true word of God so we've got to get all the error that we think thought was is might be out cuz remember I told you before Jesus never spoke false Doctrine ever he was the word yes you say oh well he did this and he did that he was the word when he drove those people out of the temple he was the word when he called them people Snakes in the Grass and Devils your father's different from mine that was God all right that wasn't now listen that wasn't Jesus's opinion right he was almighty God what his opinion him and the father never had a problem with each other now you and I we have a problem sometimes come on let one more time everybody raise hand the ones of you that didn't you L it's uncovering exposed it's an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering now watch the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ right but it's the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven church now what is the seven Church ages his bride his people so they're going to unfold or manifest Jesus Christ through the church ages but here we're at the very end we got to manifest all of them we get all the good we get all the bad everything's piled up right here all right everybody with me so now listen brother M says look you shall recall I mentioned at the beginning of this message this book we're studying is the actual revelation of Jesus now remember in the church and his work in the future ages so the Book of Revelations John was able to see and write what he saw of everything has happened right up to today and then plus amen all right then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it you see I want you to understand something and we'll get into later on there's a transition God will allow false Doctrine for a time he did with Luther but Luther wasn't to come to Perfection right or his call wasn't to perfect a group of people Wesley's call was not to yeah it perfected them in their age but I'm talking about body change I'm talking about the unwritten word I'm talking about coming up where the seals are open they didn't have any of that they preached the best they could and it was by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost but yet the Holy Ghost was bound by their false tradition and listen the Holy Ghost is bound today by our false Traditions it's bound by our false thinking brother BR said he was bound at what the door of Creeds and dogmas well that a Creed and Dogma outside of the word is wrong and you become it if you believe it brother rown told us he said we become the word is what we receive the word yes amen so we got to receive it can't get it off somewhere now listen brother randam and Paul they could go to the back side of the desert because they're prophets and God can reveal things to them and they bring it out here you and I don't go out in the middle of the desert or the middle of the woods and sit there with a pen and a pencil right you'll be scribbling and falling asleep now God may give you something I'm not saying but I'm telling you a prophet is different a prophet is aone with God I don't want that office that's right brother R didn't want it all he wanted to remember what he wanted to do he wanted to go out there and and come back out here and go do different things and God said no you go stay with your people that's right cuz he was a prophet of the people he was a prophet of the Gentiles bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means the book can't be revealed to any one but a special class of people you are that special class of people remember a prophet prophesies what he sees that's right A lot of people and it's it's not funny but it is you know brother rown said I went beyond the curtain of time and I saw all y'all there he didn't see them individually he saw his bride there he saw the people that were under his message there he didn't say I saw you Donny F Bush you know like can people get on to you and they go I I've never met you oh yeah we met before the foundation of world no that ain't right no we were nothing that's right only in the mind of God we had to come here to develop we come here developed and we can look at each other and say we both have the mind of God because we both are in agreement with the doctrines of the word of God but not that we met somewhere that's Mormon that's Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls they just don't know that Mormon Doctrine is we were all in heaven in spirit form right everybody with me amen I had two Mormons at work for me I know exactly they gave me all kind of stuff books and bibles and all that stuff and I'm sorry it just ain't right but we were all up there and we were all you know we were all wanting to glorify the father and we come up with this plan and the devil had his people and he come up with his plan and God said well I'm just going to send y'all down to earth and then you know we well I pick Jesus over the devil so I'm going to go down there and and die for you and then y'all going to just develop again right I'd rather just believe that I was in the mind of God locked up sealed knew what I was going to do knew I would love him when I got here knew I would accept this message and then as the Bible says in continuous were we fashioned one right after the other we came born in sin shapen in iniquity a spouse from our mother's womb a liar that's right doom and on our way to hell but praise God we heard from that representation and that representation call my name it called your name one day and said Come On Son come on daughter amen where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy in the mind of God absolutely but not a bunch of people running around listen you didn't pre-exist right only in the mind of God did you pre-exist remember he took the picture and he hung it up well where'd he hang it up he hung it up in his mind he didn't hanging up somewhere on a wall he hung it up in his mind and our very youthful best and then he come and let us develop all the way down here and guess what yes amen we're going right back to what that party thought right but we still got life down here folks and we got to struggle and get through this thing right you got to know one thing for sure that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul not an anointing in your soul if you got an anointing in your soul that is God that is the word and that cannot deny itself that's right amen that's why that's why that when brother Ram came to those seals he said now I see why I hated that denomination so much why it kept people from getting a new birth right cuz I'll say one more time if somebody gets a new birth you might get hatched under an egg some under a an egg under a dog right but you won't stay there once you hear that eagle cry once you hear one thing about this message you'll have to come to it you'll have to look and say that ain't nothing but the truth give me some more give me some more I've eat enough of this garbage I want some of that kind of food fresh meat yes sir oh praise the Lord what he's done for us folks good we can sit here and talk about Mysteries all he want to but let's talk about Salvation let's get saved let's get filled of the Holy Ghost and then God's going to give us understanding he promised he would that's why that that baptism is with promise that's right that baptism is with promise I'll give you the Holy Ghost you do these things repent number one and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise Paul thank God for the promise I thank God for the promise every day I may not I may not look like it sometimes you may not look like it sometimes but God didn't say I'm going to look at your flesh thank God he hears our cry through the blood we still have to listen I told yall the other day brother Brown said we are the blood by the spirit that's exactly right but you better not get yourself out from under it you better stay under that thing remember brother brandom was under it remember he was going to condemn that old woman that was sitting in that restaurant he all God you to just wipe them off you know what you know what God did he went come over here and let's get behind this door a minute and I want you to show I want to show you her no he said I want to show you you well I'm a prophet of God bless God I've got all these signs and wonders and I got people following me no you know what he done he said I felt about like that he said every time my sins would whack Jesus in the head he said blood was flatter he said my sins so let's don't ever forget that we got to have the blood we've got to have that atonement to keep us keep us saved you can't get unsaved come on that's right once you're saved I believe in in uh in eternal security if you're born again but not get born not think you you get born again and then you don't show up till the day you die right and like brother Claude wi singer said you live a hound dog life no you didn't get it in the first place amen it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight right it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction I hope today we come to hear some Supernatural instruction cuz I'll promise you the door's open for it right now the door's open for it today to get what you've not ever got before is another further revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's doing not to brother Aaron we saw what he's doing to him but to me now I'm not a selfish person y'all know that but I am selfish when it comes to that I want some of that I want some of that amen I want some of that somebody came to me the other day and said what if I just jump out and start dancing I said do you like brother Dale said be careful I might run over you as long as it's done with God we're going to dance on the streets of Glory why not practice a little down here you used to dance all them other things that y'all listen to hello somebody this thing on okay all right those things y'all yeah yeah y'all dance soon as that thing even now you go through Walmart and you had some be going stop something will check you up dump you on top of the head say all right boy don't be doing that no more oh pray for me okay sorry amen somebody at work the other day said who s that song it was one from way back in the 80s I told them who it was and they all went I said I was out there too I tell you what God did HL at this church when it was a little church and it was this was closed off and this was the sanctuary right here that was all the people that was here we got more on the stage now than we had in the first service we had we got more playing instruments than that I had just bought me a new eight track tape player brother John new one put it in my 72 Volkswagen hooked that baby under the bottom of it had me some that don't work some Ted n and some Linda ronat somebody stole it while we was at church I told Daddy I said somebody toldo my my tap player he said good cuz he knew what I was listening to so we've all had our conversation in times past of the lust of the flesh okay but now amen come on you can't help hearing it but let's dance to the word of God when that word comes out we need to have the same emotion but not with the vulgarity amen David danced to the Lord he danced remember brother R said one time he said I started dancing they started dancing and I started dancing with them I remember that time and I loved to been there when when brother brandham got the Revelation remember he got a revelation of something he said I run around around that tree now I feel like that sometimes just kind of head around that tree you know run around trying to try to run off a little energy maybe we'll lose some weight doing that but we take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God super natural instruction now we have had in this message we have had Supernatural instruction we had 1,00 sermons that was our Supernatural instruction from god of what to do now some of it now look not not comparing verse with verse not just comparing though that is good but what a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit it never becomes clear we need the Love Letter the in between how many times brother R tells that like brother Ryan sometimes it makes me sick he gets just so loveby dby mushy stuff just run off the pull pit him and Gabby Gabby's like I love it you know why she's his bride she knows what he's talking about he knows what she's talking about pray come on somebody if we get that we get thr in love with God like that go ahead he knows what we want we know what he wants and we can sit on the front row and smile about it and feel good cuz you know Ryan gets up here and says that and I'm like [Laughter] again I'm just kidding youall know I'm kidding but that's a love that's the Love Letter that's what God see the I'm sorry the denominations read this sometimes they just read it to be reading it's just a a a a good book to read and the Ten Commandments have become 10 suggestions they haven't become C Commandments and it's something we might need to do unless we think different yes or unless somebody tells us we can do different misinterpreted theology but you and I we hear from our husband we hear and listen we know what he wants if you're the bride you know I mean sister Gabby come on she knew what Ron was talking about intimately she knew what brother Ryan was talking about right why cuz they're together they're married can't you read this the same way can't you read this the same way that God's not talking to Abraham or Isaac or anybody else he's talking to you yes sir he's bringing these promises to you yes he's bringing your children your husband your wife all these Wayward people because what cuz you know there's a promise there and you stand on that promise we have to stand on it listen Believers have to believe what they cannot see the unwritten word I have to believe what I can't even see none of you sitting here saw Jesus Christ di on the cross none of you sitting here saw him at the Resurrection Day but I'll promise you one thing my life depends on it and by Revelation though through the word I can see that it happened I can see why it happened when it happened and where it happened you don't have to convince me there was a Resurrection come on if you're born again today you are the resurrection that's where it's going to come from you and I amen praise God but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know everybody say amen amen Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast we all had a place we started we all were baby milk drinkers right then what then we were required I mean Adam started just like the rest of now I'm talking about that Adam not Adam over young there I'm talking about that Adam Adam uh Roberts who drove his mama to church today prayed the prayer of faith and he got here anyway but he started as a baby right and I can remember I got picture of me holding one of them but they were little they like milk right see that's the way God is with us come on let's bring it natural God doesn't expect us to walk just as soon as we're born again he'll hold us he'll keep us but you know what he won't do when we get 16 15 he's not still going all right come on come on now learn to walk what hold on your your bottle learn to walk Adam it'd be horrible for you just to be drinking milk as big as you are you like meat don't you son well son and daughter God likes meat too don't they but remember God has it for us already that Meats in the word of God that's right them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast Romans 16:1 17 now I beseech you Brethren mark them which cause Division and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them amen all right and he gave some Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers for the perfecting of all of us that's right listen we can't perfect the world Amen God can if they'll listen for God so Lov the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life that's for everybody that that took a breath in this world but he knew some would he knew some wouldn't because before the foundation of the world he knew all this was going to happen anyway and he gave us what he gave us a railroad track amen called a Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists that preach the true Doctrine to keep your big old engine on that track amen amen and to me it's a love letter it's not a hate letter it's not a dos and don'ts right now kids I know I did the same thing do this and don't do that fall in love with God and you'll do it automatic fall in love with God you'll do it automatically cuz you got to do what the word says cuz the word's what's going to going to turn you not your mom and daddy or your grandma grandpa anybody the word what's going to turn you that's right and you got to listen to this this track that God give us Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelist for the Perfection of the Saints the work of the ministry edifying of the body of Christ look till we all come to Unity of Faith now listen when we get in heaven sure we're going to know we have positions but we're not going to have to go to church it's going to be Church 247 we don't need a refilling we're all full now we need a refilling today and I believe we got one if you'll accept it but there'll be a day when that wave will never end that's right oh come on somebody have take the best day you ever felt in your life it ain't even a drop in a bucket what it's going to be when we get there it ain't going to be a drop in a bucket when your body's changed and you don't have no ACH and knees and ache and pains and heartaches and troubles and trials and praise God no more Mondays come on amen yeah till we all come to the unity of the faith I was thinking yesterday when we look at these things I was reading what brother R was talking about something and I was reading um I can't remember what it was but oh the white Throne judgment he said they'll come before the white Throne judgment you know as the Bible says you know there's going to be a day we think well you know that's in the word of God and that's going to happen it's going to happen and you're going to be standing there that's right not in judgment but judging you're literally today you're going to judge that world when we all get to the white Throne judgment Amen to me I think sometimes it's a fairy tale right come on because we can't fathom how that we can stand before billions of people in the world and judge them right but we are amen you know what's Jud we're being judged now that's why we're separated that's why we're another class of people that's why we're prophetic people that when we hear from God we say Amen when we hear the prophet's message we say that ain't nothing but the truth there's no other truth but that and God Honors that yes that we hence forth be no more children or what babies tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they ly and waight to deceive but speaking the truth truth what in love in that Agape Love Now Ryan was standing here telling you today about his felo love for his wife that ain't a drop in the bucket to what a gap Love Is Now Gap love with them to being born again they can love like that but what what more what more big old heart big old red heart when you can be born again and have fio and agap love together wow it happens right ain't that right sister Jun amen but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him now speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in All Things yes all right so you say well how can I do that well the world try listen the world tries some of the people try but they don't have the UNR Unwritten word of God cuz when you just take the word of God and you start reading it what's going to happen you going to say eat my flesh and drink my blood right oh well well now Jesus said father son Holy Ghost over here and and Peter said uh Lord Jesus Christ uh I got a I got a question you and I don't have that question amen we don't have that question but they will question so what are they doing they're questioning everything amen I I talked to uh the brother the other day that uh that asked me to come and speak and at the Methodist Church church and I I told him I said you know y'all are seeking for a pastor and I ain't I ain't there even going to be uh put my name in no pot but um I said y'all searching for something besides a man right amen cuz whatever your denomination said y'all decided not to do it you have become independent of that denomination I said now you need to find the word of God not a man you need to find the word of God and start believing the word of God so maybe maybe we can go help them and they can maybe pattern that and find them somebody amen listen there's people there that they're looking searching they're wanting to find God because they're tired of their denomination a lot of people are tired of it that's why they'll go to and fro that's why they'll sit it home and not go anywhere you can't sit it home and know this message you can't do it you might think you know it but if you know the guy that wrote it you can't wait for them doors to open for all y'all people that think you can come in late next Sunday you better not come in late you'll be sitting downstairs amen right praise the Lord anyhow we got to start doing what the prophet said the little things if we don't do the little things you can forget about all these seals and plagues and vials and all that other stuff if you ain't got a desire to be at church on time 20 minutes before the service starts I'm sorry so oh we believe what brother rown said over here brother way but this who who who anointed you to pick and choose I'm sorry it's just what you you'll never be late how many of you been late for a doctor's appointment really really you ain't a Dale you ain't a Dale yeah a you ain't you ain't right either my mama prepares three days before right Anna right T three days before and then she call you 20 times you know why though she wants to be on time she don't want to miss something you miss that doctor's appointment it's what it's a $50 fine now right $ to $50 and they even send you a text now Regin so you can't you can't say well I forgot no my dentist about three days before are you coming press yes if you aren't say no because if you say yes hello somebody if you say yes you going to pay $50 if you don't get there if I started charging y'all being late for church we might could build us another church these praise the Lord okay all right these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are now he's preaching on the statute of perfect man all right let's get back to what we're doing but but truly Our Lives show it I'm sorry your life will show it speaks louder than what your words amen and people watch everything we do these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are sorry he's talking about these fellas over here the church ages and the and the preachers this wasn't required what this was see but he brought his church up the same way his church up the same way he's bringing his people so then Peter said first seven things Faith virtue coming up see knowledge Temperance patience God brotherly kindness brotherly love and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost all right now this is not two different holy ghosts everybody with me he didn't write new birth right here he wrote Holy Spirit now God told him what to write right remember he was sitting there squirrel hunting he laid his gun down had a pencil and paper and he said this is where I got this from he may have had that time running around the running around a tree but down here is your new birth then you get a refilling of the holy spirit because listen when you come to that part of the pyramid that's where the faith of the fathers were Peter was at that point right here now not here but right here he was right there they had things working in their life they had their Doctrine straight amen amen that's what I've been preaching on we got to restore that trans that transition to Perfection is a transition from unper to Perfection or from partial understanding which they had to a perfect understanding you said I can't do it see you've already cut yourself off right there right brother amen if you say I can't you can't that's right didn't go didn't brother BR tell us didn't God say through brother brandham that he can only go by what you confess he's a high priest of you said brother that's healing no that's everything he's the high priest of your confession I can't do well you can't that's right who was it Paul said I can do some things oh whoa whoa whoa how much all means all I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me the problem is we got to get the strength of Christ by doing the things he tells us to do being holy people kick the stuff out that we don't need amen get rid of stuff that what what Paul said all that stuff that so easily easily easily besets us Paul said easily besets us and let's run with ra this patience let race with patience look into who the author and finisher of our faith sometimes if we just read the Bible sometime it will help us a lot amen the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost now watch comes upon you in the true baptism now what's he talking about it's not true versus you had a false baptism your new birth is is a true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's your new birth that's in you this is upon you remember I preached a long time ago about anointings there's different anointings for different things today we had an anointing we always when we pray I pray that God anoint the song leader God anoint the song God anoint the players God anoint the preacher and God anoint the people to come here and sometimes honestly you wonder are they getting it or you wonder if I'm getting it both way you don't have to say that 11 okay thank you you say Amen anyway okay but that's the truth sometimes you up here like you're fighting you fighting yourself you come in some days and you're like I should have took a vacation but every little thing every little thing of God means something every little purpose of God means something the songs we sang today I had it on my heart yesterday when when brother Joe sent out that uh email or sent out that WhatsApp if anybody had a special and I didn't I I was going to send there in a message but I thought I'll just tell him in the morning he's he's always ready to go he don't have to practice or or clear his throat he's ready to sing why cuz he loves to sing and God gave him a gift to sing but I want him to sing about Paul and Silas because I wanted to church to know that we're free the story about Paul and Silas they got free Moses people they got free Daniel in the lies Den I heard a preacher the other day said man said think about Daniel down in that lines Den with all those lines said he probably had the best sleep he had he just curled up against one of them lines and laid his head on their man and it's just as soft as everything he said he's just slept all night listen when you have confidence in God you can sleep in a lion day when you have confidence in God you can sleep anywhere you can sleep in a lion's den that doesn't bother you it didn't bother Daniel I don't believe he I don't believe it bothered him I believe he saw that he was going to make it through now you and I going to have to see the same thing that we make it through well I don't see there we go I I don't believe that I'm this and I'm that I'm too old I'm too this I'm too that God never said in here he never said anything about being old except that we' get gray hair and have wisdom he didn't saying I'm going to I'm going to deal with the young people and I'm not going to deal with the old people older sorry older people I'm in that group now 65 card care and Medicare never thought it brother klie never never never brother klie was young one time he's still young yeah it's been a long time but I've known you for a long time too so the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now what we were talking about the unwritten part that's what brother Ryan's talking about the unwritten part that no one else can see but me and you no one it's a mystery and in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said you're part of that mystery that's right you and I are part of the mystery of God how that we can stand in this evil age yes the worst there ever was the darkest there ever was and we can have a service like we did today and defeat the Devil by just being who we are God's children God's people right we got to know where we stand amen all right you get all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle now it wasn't that he didn't live in before but he's being able now to fully Express himself yes right there because headstone we're going to get to all that The Headstone is love now we're going to read it here in just a few minutes I may be a little bit lengthy today but that's okay I'm cooking me and brother Danny we're cooking today I we got we say we started cooking a few minutes ago y'all might not like all that but I sure enjoy if somebody wants to I wish we had a room big enough to where you could run all the way around it if you do it in the Lord it it'll help somebody Maybe I want to be happy with what who we are are you sad about who you are then you ain't got the new birth you got to have to be to be happy people you got to be born again if you're not born again it's all dos and don'ts and I got to do this I don't do that I got to do this got to do that I got to go to church no I want to go to church when a man possesses these kinds of things possesses now I want to be possessed by that devil I mean that that God not that devil see there when a man possesses these things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues now watch you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when these virtues grow in you and you added that to it then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol brother Brown 1962 now watch he beats every Creed every denomination every man made Dogma until he sees his own reflection on life reflecting in you if I do not the works of my father believe me not see if what is purposed to the church now watch if what is purpos to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue and all these things Temperance and all these things godliness brotherly kindness now watch and all these things that's required of you required Brother Richard Roberts uh he came down here to marry my sister he had intentions but when he came down here he told Dad he said I never was taught these virtues was required is that right he said I never thought nobody ever taught me now he's been the message since he was a kid I a lot of y'all shaking your head too they're required it's required teaching brother M didn't just waste his time on that great message the statue of perfect man that's required of you no matter what you've done no matter how much youve shouted how many churches you've joined and how many feathers youve pinned in yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if you pull a handful of beer from one side you turn the cheek with sweetness until these virtues no matter what they say to you remembering the Lord now watch if this is 1963 this is after he preach that if there anything lacking with us let's get back to it let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to haveen well I'm so spiritual I don't have to be here five minutes before the church opens well you got you got a spirit on you that's for sure amen let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have but what he said we've got to have and look we got to have it that way well I want it my way well go ahead it won't be God's way that's right amen he remember he said my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts my thoughts are higher but I'm going to tell you something when you get in Christ your thoughts are going to be right there with his now remember now look Adam before the fall his thoughts were the thoughts of God come on somebody he named all the animals he had control of all the Earth and God never said no stop don't do that he said That's My Boy Adam keep going keep naming them animals that's exactly what was in my mind why because he had the mind of God you and I have to get back to that like Brother Richard Wilson said this message is going to take us back across the chasm of that fall that we're in and take us back to the Garden of Eden all God was he poured into Christ Christ he pour into church take her back to the Garden of Eden you said I don't know how that see there you go right I do know how right that Garden of Eden has got to start in you firsten you got to get your garden right first you got to get your soil right first once you get your soil right don't worry about mine you get yours right let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have so Hebrews 6 say therefore leaving the principle the doctrine of Christ let us go into Perfection now boy you talking about somebody that that that had to depend on God because what he wrote in the this is Paul what he wrote in the New Testament think about this what he wrote in the New Testament was not written in the Old Testament or it wouldn't be a new testament he'd have just copied he'd just copied the Old Testament brought over here and said here no it was new amen but it came out of yes the written word that was already back there the Torah the prophets and all those different things so Paul knew that there was a principle that we need to live by but that we need to go on to that Unwritten part that the world can't see the world can't understand think we're crazy praise God if I'm going to lose my mind I want to lose it with God I don't want to lose it in the world we know we leaving means to go to another place it's not when we leave here and go home or go to this place doesn't dissolve right it's still here so we build on this and move on and the principles is everything that we all the principles just like I saying all the conduct order and Doctrine if we don't get those things right don't think you can understand everything else cuz you let me tell you why you know why cuz number one I'm GNA preach on it and remind you about it and number two the devil's going to remind you about it that's right God's going to remind you about it right am amen Aon you probably need to come up here and sing just one more time some have lost the spirit so the devil starts out remember in the O in the old ages in the in the time of the of the uh Nan Council they knew about the Old Testament they knew of Paul's writings and they probably had some of the writings cuz that's what they used I mean listen the Catholics the Catholics didn't even write their own Bible they just put it in Latin so nobody can understand it right they didn't deny the Bible but it wasn't put together to later but they had pieces of it remember the Latin Vulgate is the only way we got it to give it to King George I mean King James to write the Bible you're looking at now it came from the Roman Catholic church so they had all these writings but what did they do they put false teaching in it the devil come in and said okay no that's not right we need to what the Saints uh yeah you need to pray to them cuz they're wonderful Mary Mary uh um ascended you know resurrected with Jesus and she ascended and she's a mother of god well that all came from the Bible some piece of it did but not the truth of it amen listen they saw their Unwritten part but they didn't see our Unwritten part amen then that Doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet but now remember just as the devil does his deed saying deed Doctrine so do you and I when you come into justification you you've heard something maybe you hadn't heard before and something stirring in your heart it won't won makes you come back right amen am I speaking to somebody makes you come back there something is like cuz how many times have you told people about this message that's right and it's just like hitting the wall amen but sometimes though when somebody goes the L comes on and I'll promise you when they come back and say where'd you get that from or how did you see that they're at least wanting to know something so what are you going to do from a saying it becomes a deed something we do and then it becomes our Doctrine and that Doctrine is who you are today we either have the doctrine of Christ or the doctrine of the devil one of the two all right now he never went to Israel he went to Rome so listen to right here where' that first Doctrine come from outside the Bible it came from Rome it didn't come from Heaven didn't come from Jesus didn't come from the disciples it came from Rome it came from a pope they started accepting Dogma now second Peter listen to Just a second now we're coming to a new we have never seen this Earth just for a second we've never seen this Earth fully restored right right cuz I'm looking at your Earth not fully restored we're connected all right we're connected so when when Adam fell the animals fell the Earth fell right and it became chaos I mean cha you see it tornadoes where they never have been before somebody had a tornado the other day in January never had one before in their life and had one in January do you know there's a I think there's a website something about about earthquakes but there's like 7 or 800 earthquakes a day happening around the world yes the one just happened the other day in along the Mississippi River you read about that it was pretty tough too I mean it shook a lot of stuff you know why because it's not in its right to be conditioned right amen if you'll read birth pains brother rme tells you the world is rocking and reeling yes you know why because we're not back to our right to be conditioned you and I are the one that's going to bring it back right the first Adam and the first Eve could not do it the second Adam and the second Eve is going to restore it back but tell them that walk up to somebody and say I am where God dwells at this moment yeah I'd laugh to I am where God dwells right I am a chosen of God I am Eternal in my soul I know what God Said from the beginning I have the mind of that God and if you make it that far they might listen but most time they've done called you a heretic and run off or either get some mad they want to fight you so you don't do it you do it kind of far away from when you tell them that oh yeah but honestly that's who we are right that's right what I just said that's exactly what we are we are the children of God we are the Perfection of God we are the final voice of the final age there is no other age there is no other voice it's in a bride so if you're a bride it's in you go tell the world that oh no it's said over here no it's over here no it's over here Jesus told us he said hey he said there'll come a time when they're false Christ not false Jesus is false Jesus told us this in Matthew 24 there'll come false Christ and say hey hey I'm uh Christ is over here he said don't go go he said oh Christ is over here he said don't go why you better know that Christ is in you to lead and guide you where he wants you to go not where man wants you to go see that's the unwritten part how many of you can understand that we are living totally Unwritten word of God we have listen we don't do away with this you can't you can't make it other stuff like polygamy and you sorry that's right the unwritten part those Thunders are not they're Unwritten but they John was going to write them down but they're hid in this right here but remember brother brandham said that the Thunder of God was me and you thousands of lived voices people have made it everything else amen but me and you right it's not going to be there's not going to be another Cloud that's right amen there's not going to be another Seven Peaks right there's not going to be another earthquake like it was in in Alaska right that's all done with me but we believe that and our foundational truths are proven by these signs in the heaven but if I don't have the new birth and I take that cloud that's why people can't understand it you can say all you want to about them people that went away from the message I'll tell you one more time they were not born again right amen listen I didn't need that cloud to get born again that's right but when I got born again I relate to that cuz that was Christ coming down to me me so brother BR said according to Malachi 4 and Revelations 107 The Mighty angel came down with a open book in his hand and gave it to me amen folks he never gave it to that seventh angel messenger he gave it to John now the seventh angel messenger told him what to do or the seventh angel messenger was there remember brother BR said while the seventh angel messenger is here on Earth at the time of his coming that coming absolutely amen but remember it was brother R didn't just take it with him right I'm going to skip something we'll get to that and then we'll close talking about a change in his ministry now brother R I'm talking about a change in his ministry and that's what we're going to get to just for a few minutes there was a change but now watch brother random and his Humanity you got to think that he had come from a healing campaign from 1947 to 1958 11 years he'd been watching the sick healed he had watched coming from holding them by the hand to telling them the very secrets of their heart all right he said there's now going to be a change in my Ministry I would take left my left hand and lay it on the person right hand and not use my own voice and it would speak out and tell them what was wrong with him brother R says the holy spirit says then you if you be be sincere it'll come to a place where you'll know the very secrets of the heart how many of you that was in my first meetings heard me tell that before it ever come to pass if you'll continue on to be sincere it'll grow greater and greater now here's what we're going to have a little bit of maybe conflict brother Brandon was looking at his Healing Ministry getting stronger right but that was not it in his Humanity that's what he thought right because he keeps on saying he said I'll just speak it and it'll happen well that is what the third poll is but it's not in a prayer line it's in his people now watch it will be a new ministry this ministry will never cease he didn't quit praying for the sick it will continue on this first will continue on still just the same God gives gifts he never takes them away in other words he's not a Indian giver all right now watch he's always done it like Luther Wesley and on down now he tells in 1960 now he's coming from 1958 to 1960 still talking about a new ministry right he's waiting on something in a prayer line um view of things all right everybody with me cuz he saw the tent and he saw the people going into the tent and and getting healed but you got to remember you and I and any denomination that was during the time brother random was there their body was hurting they needed spiritual healing as much as they need a natural healing amen with me right be stick with me just for a minute all right we'll close right on this I won't go any further I'll get it to it next time now right it's not in discernment 1960 he talking about his new ministry I cut this short discernment I find them things out but this is not discernment I'm searching for a new ministry all of you understand well all right well they were looking for and we know he did speak the word to Sister media and different things like that but that wasn't the third Paul I'll read it to you in just a second real quick first poll Healing Ministry second poll prophecy amen third pull opening of the word all right so now we're going to get into the pull so don't lose me here it's God pulling you to a place God will never push you anywhere no right amen that's right he's a gentleman the Holy Ghost is a gentleman everybody with me so he's got to pull you into these things so the first pull was what CAU the little baby fish everybody looking oh brother Bram you're a good fisherman second pull and then remember he got all that tangled up but I'm not going to get into that cuz his ministry wasn't tangled up I think it was the people that was around him they got it all tangled up that's right so this time there's a new Ministry coming ahead now look this is 1960 later on in the year right now he was going to say I'm going to change it tonight see he keeps thinking this is something in a prayer line now listen that tent you can make it whatever you want to you can believe it's a natural tent if you want to I don't need it to get born again I'm born again here I don't need to I don't need to go through that little thing to make me born again maybe for the change of the body I don't know but I promise you one thing thus that the Lord Brother R ain't coming back and telling us something he didn't tell us already so if he does come back you better be ready you better know what he's already said and you better be identified with Christ and not with himly so if he wants to put up tent that's fine I've never like Dad said he's never one way or the other he can bring bring if he wants to but if we don't know what he said today if we don't know what brother brandham said today if we're not getting the unwritten part today you're not going to get it there you're going to do just like the Pharisees did you think you're you think you're so and so you think you're so and so so he said I better go back to the old ministry tonight because there was a lot of new people there and have the new ministry start tomorrow evening now it didn't but he was wanting it he was he was a man he wanted it to happen he fell the what he felt the pull of God in his ministry but he's he's back on the prayer line but remember in 1960 when he preached the the U individual messages of the church ages then they compiled it together and he said all right this m of Malachi 4 is do two things we've read it aund times thousand times he found out then what his ministry was it separated this was getting everybody back this was Unwritten this was getting everybody back to the faith of fathers this was the unwritten part all right amen back in 1960 the new ministry is to curse the disease that's in there have you noticed what the holy spirit's done first thing when he told me was pray for the sick now I complained said they won't listen to me CU I'm not educated then he said I'll give you two gifts right remember of Moses he gave Moses two gifts he pulled his hand out right so you have to watch that I'm trying to hurry up I may have to back up later on that becomes entertainment that's right if you don't believe that then there'll be another sign which you was born with you'll see the Visions know what the people has done and all about them and so forth that's the second pull amen right then did I tell you that the Lord told me that there would be another Ministry you remember that which would be the Discerning of the thoughts he's back to the second one again well them Ministries has worked perfectly the world around one when its day the other one lived this day now a little later on if I get chance I want to tell you what happened just recently bringing in new ministry I'll just speak the word now prayer line you can say that if you want to but when he started speaking the word of God is when no seals open amen that's right most of you older ones agree 100% when the seals open that's when he started speaking the word and it became real to him and to us all right everybody okay with that cuz he was telling people what was wrong with him a long time ago I mean back in the 50s and 60 early 60s now look he said now the second Ministry is leaving the third is entering in I'm so glad about it standing in the Gap 1963 he never told you a wrong interpretation now watch here's a here's a dream remember Junior Jackson's dream we'll close right here he told me that he Dreamed a Dream Junior Jackson that up here somewhere like in Indiana there was a long great grassy Hill and the water had washed all the soil off the top and it became a rock like a ball top on the mountain and then in this rock there was funny riding and said I was stand in there with all the Brethren around the church here interpreting this writing all right hold on right this writing that they could see right then when it come time that I got all of it interpreted first part of his ministry when he got it all interpreted to those people then somehow or another if I understand the dream right got a hold of something like a crowbar or some kind of angle bar so what it was sealed oh come on somebody it was sealed you couldn't see what was inside there was a written part on the outside faith of the fathers was right here getting back to the word of God getting back to doing the things of God then he took a bar a pry bar and cut the top off of the mountain like this right here took the top off and what'd he do on the inside of it was White Rock something on the order of granite or something on that side some White Rock now watch that wasn't written on Watch and I said Brethren stay here and look in on this and while they were looking I slipped out from among them and started going west brother Jackson said he saw me going over one Hill and another Hill what he was going back West to do what why' he go back West to meet those angels but remember he had to come back to Jeffersonville to preach it but he met those angels out there in Arizona right he told what the interpretation was this was on the outside watch when the interpretation was given here at the church before it came to pass the time is now that I believe that the full Revelation through the age of Luther Wesley John Smith Alexander Campbell and different ones that's preached on the Bible and then we got over in the Bible and showed that there would be a seventh Angel's message and at the sounding of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God will be made known then come seven mysterious Thunders we'll get into that later on now we find that in this I told you the interpretation on the Rock and what The Rock is Christ and that was in the brother's dream and that's the Bible and for all these years the Bible has been interpreted till we've absolutely given the ecclesiastical interpretation through in other words you're not all right and the last gift being added in the Le of age which is the seventh Angel's time to preach in the Le out of age at that time that there would be a lot of things that was misconstrued down Through the Ages Luther preaching justification but he let it run wild we know how that happened we going down and now after the Bible had been interpreted completely then you notice it opened up the Top of the Rock everybody with me we'll get back over this again I don't want to confuse you this is a dream Junior Jackson had brother RS interpreting the dream now after the Bible had been interpreted what the outside part that man could see was interpreted then you notice it opened up the top of the pyramid like Rock Amen not pyramid teaching the man who teaches that I guess they know what you're talking about I know nothing about it but it was the shape of the pyramid but the cap on the pyramid was never put on I've been in Egypt so watch in the church it was the Cornerstone what down here Amen in the full church it was a headstone right you and I are the full church it was a headstone so it never did come it was rejected Christ and it will come and I believe that when it's coming that the church WIll shape into a place from justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the Pentecostal message will bring the church to such a what a minority amen and a ministry will be among those people not one person those people till it'll be exactly the same Ministry that Jesus Christ did that'll bring Jesus and catch the whole thing away amen one more time this is a different angle of the of the U dream brother R told it again in the seventh seal then we'll close right here and notice the next thing now I took some kind of a bar and cut it off now remember it was sealed right and on the inside was White Rock that had nothing wrote on it the unwritten part and at that time I started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west in other words don't follow follow me there okay there was one dream where junior said he was up on like a saucer remember that and he said you can't come up here only the people that are in other words have the anointing can come up here to where he's at yeah and I think we are that people yeah he said I'll ride this Trail again well he is he's riding it in us he ain't going to come back ride a horse good grief shallow and I told them I said don't go out west stay here and look on this stay here and listen to what I'm saying take this foundation and and get it right stay right here he went West for the blast went West returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word now if that isn't perfectly the God almighty I want you to know what it is what am I trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time amen now brother R talks about the lure we'll get into that we'll talk about the first PLL second pull but I want to go down here and tell you now remember right here this anointing ones at the End Time come on musician brother bam is telling the dream about the third pole about the fish and we'll get into that we'll break all that down notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on written part amen he didn't come to bring the written part He restored the written part and then brought the unwritten part everybody with me not when he starts on but when he begins declare his message see the first pull healing healing campaign second pull prophesying in other words telling the people the secrets of the heart today I am telling you the secret secr of your heart if you'll listen because what secret in your heart that you need I hope God's going to give you today question or whatever more the first poll healing second Paul prophesying what was he prophesying of a group of people and the third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third poll was the opening of The Seven Seals his ministry the one he'd been looking for since the 50s God showed him right there that was his last part the third part of his ministry was the opening of those seals not that he was going to have a greater healing campaign the greatest healing campaign was is when he preached to us let's stand amen when he preached this to us it caused a shock wave in heaven that opened up the way to have our body change it opened up a way to heal us from top of our head to the bottom of our feet and it be an eternal healing cuz listen you can get healed today and be sick tomorrow the way we're in the state we are now but you can't be healed in your your soul and be sick in your soul tomorrow yeah you can get things happen to you in your spirit realm but you can't get the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull now what' he say the third pull was or the third part of his ministry was what the opening of The Seven Seals reveal the unwritten part or the unwritten word that's been sealed in the Bible since the foundation of the world what a what a group of people we ought to be folks we ought to be just so happy Jesus's Ministry had three polls a lot of people had you and I have three polls in your journey you have justification you have sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost first poll second PLL third pole oh that's just for the prophet sorry folks we are prophetic people he told us we were so whatever he said I'm going to believe it that what brother brandham got we get he said now these things I'll take to my grave and people have said all kind of garbage about that he might God may have told him some things that he did take to his grave but it was not for mine and your Perfection God's not going to send us somebody else to perfect us he gave us a message gave us the Holy Ghost and gave us a good fivefold Ministry to get us there we don't need nothing else I mean what else do you need you waiting for some great one to come show me that in the Bible there's only one great one and he already came the world missed him that's what he's going to tell the people he he's even going to tell the Jews you missed it you missed me in my first coming you missed me in my second coming but I've come back to get you because guess what I can't forget you cuz you were my first wife I can't for forget Israel cuz he said in the word he couldn't forget Israel you love the Lord he's good to us to give us these things he's good to us to let us know what is going to happen and what's happening right now and it's just listen the world's going to fall apart we know that yes but the bride's not going to fall apart God is never fell apart and he never will fall apart and if it's inside of you guess what you're not going to fall apart sure we're going to have ups and downs sure we're going to have trials and tribulations but God said he's going to have a bride yes sir that he's going to be able to trust with what he said and that's what brother Ram in that third Ministry he said I'll just speak the word well guess what that's what he did he spoke it and you and I came forth he spoke it and you and I have an ability to take a change of a body where no one else listen no one else will be able to and will ever ever be able to duplicate it can't happen God bless you let's sing a song Let's just sing all hell King Jesus sing
