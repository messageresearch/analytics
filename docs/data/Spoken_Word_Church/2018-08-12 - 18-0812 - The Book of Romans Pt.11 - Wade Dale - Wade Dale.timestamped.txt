[0:00] going back running stitch for just few
[0:02] minutes just to kind of go back through
[0:03] but we went through it before because
[0:05] remember this is the baptismal scripture
[0:09] that we use but we need to get this part
[0:13] to show that verse 7 is the continuation
[0:17] so watch what shall we say then shall we
[0:19] continue in sin that grace may abound
[0:21] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[0:25] sin live any longer therein I want to
[0:31] scroll over thinking no you're not that
[0:35] so many of us as were baptized into
[0:36] Jesus Christ were baptized into this
[0:38] death death burial resurrection
[0:40] therefore when we are buried with him by
[0:42] baptism into death that like as Christ
[0:45] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[0:47] of the Father even so we also should
[0:49] walk in newness of life now that doesn't
[0:52] mean could we read the first part of
[0:55] this scripture e it looks like he says
[0:57] were baptized into his death as Christ
[0:59] was raised from the dead by the glory of
[1:00] the Father you think he was fixing to
[1:02] say that we'll be resurrected like him
[1:04] no even so we should walk in newness of
[1:09] life till he's done by us being dead but
[1:10] being walking through life being a dead
[1:13] person that's what we are we're dead to
[1:15] sin we should be dead to all the other
[1:17] things of the world for if we have been
[1:20] planted together in the likeness of a
[1:22] dead then you and I have not been
[1:23] planted okay that's what we do the
[1:27] funeral we plant when we plant them we
[1:29] put them in the ground I know but now
[1:32] Christians all we're doing is we're just
[1:33] putting the shell that's think about
[1:35] this yesterday working week we put them
[1:40] in the ground but that's just a shell
[1:42] that person is not even nail it forces
[1:44] nowhere even close you know we say
[1:48] whatever you want to yeah he's close or
[1:50] she's close but she's in another
[1:51] dimension but they have departed from
[1:53] this dimension yes and there's they had
[1:56] to leave the body here because remember
[1:58] their body was created in this to me
[2:00] not in that dimension now the body they
[2:03] went to is created in that dimension
[2:06] because we were formed in the image the
[2:09] image come here when we're born again in
[2:11] the soul the new man new mr. black that
[2:14] new man is what goes across the curtain
[2:16] of time not the body the body came from
[2:19] mom and daddy it was a natural act to
[2:21] get us here as human beings to let us
[2:24] express ourselves so whatever that
[2:26] expression is when you leave here you
[2:29] can't take the body with you because
[2:31] it's not as solid it's in the first
[2:33] three dimensions you know this part
[2:35] right here is in this dimension he can't
[2:36] go into another dimension but now that
[2:39] if we be planted together in the
[2:42] likeness of his death we shall we shall
[2:44] be also in the likeness of his
[2:47] resurrection
[2:48] so what likeness are we him in the
[2:50] resurrection he went to another
[2:53] dimension he left his body here he
[2:55] couldn't take his body crossed another
[2:56] dimension because why it was formed in
[2:59] this dimension Jesus's body was formed
[3:02] in this dimension his human body so he
[3:05] can take it with it the contrary he
[3:09] can't he's gotta come like us just like
[3:10] us he can't take that flesh body in
[3:12] another dimension until the resurrection
[3:16] resurrection he stepped out of that
[3:18] dimension in by into this dimension
[3:20] connected back up to the body and it
[3:23] became glorified it became eternal my
[3:25] brother man said he inherited eternal
[3:27] life ends by we had to come back here to
[3:29] get the whole thing we have to look at
[3:34] though is as ice thinking the other day
[3:35] we've got to go up one nice because
[3:37] that's easy to do because if you die you
[3:39] go over another dimension your soul
[3:40] stays there until whenever but we which
[3:45] are alive and remain is gonna do
[3:46] something that no one else has ever done
[3:48] on the face of the earth even Jesus he
[3:52] just went born in sin we were going to
[3:55] seeing Shaitan iniquity of bound to hell
[3:57] he wasn't he came into this dimension
[3:59] he's turned a man we did
[4:04] contrary to any belief you want to
[4:06] believe it just take to me it just so
[4:08] simple to leave the thing the way it is
[4:10] as I tell them you this morning thereby
[4:14] ultimately how much come here was
[4:16] something inside of it was a seizure or
[4:18] whatever if you come here any different
[4:22] than Judas Iscariot Judas on the day of
[4:26] judgment can stand up and say God I
[4:28] didn't have the chance though speaking
[4:30] because you brought me some way special
[4:32] I mean you brought them some way special
[4:34] and you didn't let me do it so everybody
[4:36] then Paul concludes here a little bit
[4:40] later they were all the morning scene
[4:41] right we're all understanding I just
[4:44] like it that way that way then Judas
[4:47] can't stand up and say well no way now
[4:49] you put that little eternal something
[4:51] whatever it is inside of him it just
[4:54] made him eternal and that's just the way
[4:55] it's gonna be God and I had no choice
[4:58] no God's gonna walk up one day are you
[5:00] gonna walk up the garden one day and he
[5:02] may try to say that the cards gonna say
[5:04] I give you the same choice I gave him so
[5:07] then then God's not a respecter of
[5:09] persons I don't know why people can't
[5:11] see that but they take notes and quotes
[5:15] or kill you if you can't put it together
[5:16] in front therefore we are buried why
[5:19] don't we have to do all this if we got
[5:21] this eternal journal or she'd already
[5:23] innocence why don't we have to don't do
[5:24] any of that right that's my question why
[5:27] do we have to go through this one why
[5:29] does the Bible even read that's right
[5:31] why was the Bible II during the Bible's
[5:34] read and watch the book of Redemption
[5:36] sometimes all so I got a hangnail on
[5:41] what quit them therefore we are buried
[5:45] with him by baptism into death now
[5:49] there's nothing physically right that's
[5:52] not physical death that like as Christ
[5:56] was raised up a good postman always
[5:58] brings bring the clothes yuri-chan open
[6:02] six hundred play yesterday open nine
[6:04] hundred boxes and I get hangnail I can't
[6:11] stick my thumb in the mouth and cry
[6:12] about it
[6:14] that like as Christ was raised up from
[6:17] the dead by the glory of the Father even
[6:18] so we should walk in newness of life for
[6:21] if we there's that we I'm still working
[6:24] on a sermon on week so that we I heard
[6:27] he got on the other day on the radio
[6:28] that was really neat he said he said
[6:31] when you go to the graveyard
[6:32] he said you look at the beginning of
[6:34] somebody's life you know birth date then
[6:37] you see their ending of life he said I'm
[6:40] not concerned with those two he said I
[6:42] want to know what happened in that
[6:43] little space that they got that little
[6:44] lying drum think of that not because the
[6:48] birth date is okay it got you there the
[6:51] death date we know where you go you're
[6:54] departed what happens in between that
[6:55] will he says I don't eat sometimes
[6:57] they're not gonna buy the next law they
[6:59] said where there's a lifetime he said I
[7:01] don't know what that - means the - is
[7:04] forever things that creep that's that
[7:09] sermon it's just notice it's - - for if
[7:14] we have been planning together the life
[7:16] as soon as death which means now okay we
[7:19] shall also be in the lack of sermons
[7:21] resurrection knowing this that our old
[7:23] man is crucified with him then when you
[7:25] crucify somebody want you killing that's
[7:28] why that to me it's just so simple that
[7:31] you came here with a nature that was
[7:33] black and it was attached to your soul
[7:37] the person you are that was attacked
[7:39] that's why the soul is the nature of the
[7:41] Spirit you were born with the nature and
[7:43] if you let that nature cultivate at 12
[7:46] years old whenever the age of
[7:47] accountability is you starts dragging
[7:49] you down it's like a sucker it just
[7:51] keeps sucking on your soul and then it
[7:53] just makes you black then one day what
[7:55] happens remember there's no gonna be a
[7:57] laundry list of wine you walk up to the
[8:00] white throne judgement somebody says
[8:02] well God said now you come here the
[8:04] doctor you smoked you drank you did this
[8:06] know one thing did you believe me or did
[8:09] you not believe me
[8:10] I finally asked her brother Brown I said
[8:11] no he said gonna pray tell
[8:13] she said whoa whoa brother Ram what he
[8:15] said unbeliev
[8:16] so what's up guys I'm not going to take
[8:19] very long because you just walk up and
[8:21] say or you believe we're in unbelievers
[8:22] you know you didn't believe me so this
[8:24] is what you did this is the attribute of
[8:26] you not believe but if we be planted
[8:29] together in the likeness of his depth
[8:30] which also be in the likeness of his
[8:32] resurrection and what was his
[8:33] resurrection he came from another
[8:36] dimension come into this dimension took
[8:41] the body up changed the body by what was
[8:43] inside of me and still walked on the
[8:45] earth 30 to 40 days and glorified body
[8:47] same live with us knowing this that our
[8:49] old man is crucified with him that the
[8:52] body of sin might be destroyed that
[8:54] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[8:58] he that is dead it's freed from sin
[9:00] remember we're going to the next
[9:02] situation here which is he talks a
[9:05] little bit about marriage and divorce
[9:06] which just they taught you your
[9:08] spiritual life table now if we be dead
[9:11] with Christ we believe that we should
[9:14] also live with him I like what what
[9:19] brother Ron Spencer said Thursday 9:00
[9:21] he said he was listening to brother Dan
[9:24] Daisley one the last sermon he preached
[9:26] to his church he walks up read the
[9:27] scripture takes his tags and says I
[9:30] believe my wife's having an affair yeah
[9:35] they did this same thing he said the
[9:39] whole church was just silent looking at
[9:40] you know brother damn and then he
[9:42] started reading the scripture about how
[9:44] that we we're supposed to be dead our
[9:50] old guys was supposed to be dead he
[9:52] stole my cab ride he's gone my cab rider
[9:53] fooling around with other denominations
[9:55] are fooling around with her own idea or
[9:57] fooling around with doctrine my wife's
[9:59] having an affair
[10:03] that was his congregation he was talking
[10:06] yes he was talking brother on
[10:07] conversation I believe my little fairy
[10:10] friend that he died he died on the sim
[10:13] once
[10:14] I'm sorry knowing that Christ being
[10:16] raised from the dead died in the morning
[10:18] all right dad has no more dominion over
[10:21] him
[10:21] but now what he gets we get for him that
[10:25] he died he died understand once but then
[10:27] he liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[10:31] reckon he also yourself Dan indeed unto
[10:34] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[10:36] Christ our Lord
[10:38] in other words allows through God unto
[10:42] God through our Redeemer Lord Jesus
[10:44] Christ is our Redeemer
[10:46] he's I read em he's our Redemption
[10:48] holder he's the bull has he done the
[10:51] right of her name he's the only good
[10:53] right let not sin therefore reign in
[10:56] your mortal body that you should obey it
[10:59] in the lusts thereof I neither yield ye
[11:02] your members as instruments of
[11:03] unrighteousness understand but yield
[11:06] yourselves unto God as those that are
[11:08] alive from the dead and your members as
[11:10] instruments of righteousness unto God
[11:12] and know what he's done is he's come out
[11:14] into that middle man you don't send
[11:18] yourself if you're born again you can't
[11:20] see we're not talking about standing in
[11:21] yourself right you don't see in yourself
[11:23] if you're born again if you're not you
[11:27] just are seen but if you stand in your
[11:29] soul then there's just there's there's
[11:32] sin in there and it needs to die though
[11:34] husband still alive yes but when the old
[11:37] husband's dead what he's talking about
[11:39] look yield yourselves unto God what
[11:42] we're done if you're born again where's
[11:45] God you know that's our problem it's
[11:48] what it's telling burly's people last
[11:49] week our problem is we don't yield to
[11:51] that thing that we say that we have
[11:53] that's the most powerful thing in the
[11:55] world it's the whole ego
[11:57] the burner of your soul the one they put
[11:59] God inside of you the Creator we don't
[12:01] yield that we yield what does American
[12:04] concentration make me thank you do I
[12:09] live about what's in there your life
[12:12] shows whether it's a marathon yes yes
[12:19] because you remember this whole name
[12:22] this whole world is dead people walking
[12:23] you sure they're alive but and see there
[12:29] you go - and I was thinking about this
[12:32] also you there's a balance because we
[12:36] are special we are chosen we are eternal
[12:42] people walking in flesh bodies and the
[12:44] whole world's not but if we think that
[12:47] were greater because of that I doubt
[12:50] that that's in there because remember
[12:52] Jesus was God Almighty in human flesh
[12:54] and he Lord they thought he was so they
[12:57] don't even so fooled the devil because
[12:59] he hung around with sinners and wine
[13:01] bitters and and prosecutes and hey
[13:04] remember they walk up in this is what's
[13:06] your master you think you think this guy
[13:07] have said he in other words one of
[13:09] religious people say you know fella
[13:11] simple does yeah he fell shifted them
[13:14] centers when him you know who least
[13:15] hanging around out there
[13:17] see that's why they called a pellicle
[13:19] but why they didn't have anything inside
[13:22] of them no representation to say hey
[13:26] that could be the Messiah but that was
[13:29] already written so they already made
[13:30] their choice by for knowledge for
[13:34] knowledge God knew all this okay for
[13:37] knowledge you can understand everything
[13:39] would you take predestination down the
[13:41] line and it is Judas he didn't choose us
[13:44] he did and that ain't the way things
[13:46] that's not the way it is
[13:50] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[13:53] for ye are not under the law but under
[13:56] grace what then shall we sin because we
[14:00] are not under the law but under grace
[14:02] god forbid no you know that to whom ye
[14:05] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[14:08] servants ye are to whom you obey whether
[14:11] of sin unto death or of obedience unto
[14:14] righteousness is asking the question but
[14:16] God be thanked that we are the servant
[14:18] that we were the servants of sin that's
[14:25] my question how can we have some spot of
[14:27] eternal life in our soul and be a sinner
[14:30] you came you can't have bitter watering
[14:33] and sweet watering the same well I just
[14:37] think we were lost yeah we were lost we
[14:41] were we were doomed and we were black in
[14:43] our soul our soul was so negative to God
[14:47] and then all of a sudden the fires out
[14:50] comes kills the old man the unclean
[14:53] spirit goes out of a man walks and dry
[14:55] places the Bible tells you all these
[14:57] things but it's just hard for people to
[14:59] sing because of white because of quotes
[15:03] staying about this morning about Daniel
[15:05] 70 weeks ago because of quotes because
[15:08] of quotes there's so much the division
[15:10] about Daniel 70 weeks until they you
[15:12] know people will one preacher said
[15:16] that's a sham kickin doctrine don't
[15:20] think it starts getting up to our
[15:22] antenna
[15:24] well why is it a sham kicking doctrine
[15:27] is the Bible tells us that there's one
[15:30] week left after the rapture so I don't
[15:32] really I'm gonna make it strong I don't
[15:34] care what brother Ram said yes ma'am I
[15:36] know if he said it contrary to the Bible
[15:39] he's wrong anyone he was the Prophet he
[15:43] knew how to put it together and he knew
[15:45] that they would know
[15:47] you that we have contained they have
[15:48] contingent over that one that one
[15:52] doctrine but the Bible says there's one
[15:55] week left so I'm gonna stay with that
[15:57] and then I can make everything fit well
[16:01] brother I'm saying I can make it fit
[16:02] we've done it before and all the things
[16:05] that we did with the Jewish calendars
[16:06] and all that stuff we may fit we didn't
[16:09] make it fit
[16:10] God's got somebody on there that can
[16:11] make it fit right and then but God be
[16:14] thanked to you you were the servants of
[16:16] sin but ye have obeyed from the heart
[16:21] now where's the heart of hearts to solve
[16:23] this man that form of doctrine which was
[16:26] delivered you Paul delivered them a sin
[16:32] killing doctrine
[16:34] you were once servants of sin but ye
[16:38] have obeyed from the heart that form of
[16:39] doctrine which was delivered to you
[16:41] being then made free from sin ye became
[16:44] the servants of righteousness all right
[16:46] I speak after the manner of men because
[16:49] of the infirmity of your flesh for as
[16:53] you have yielded your members servants
[16:55] to uncleanness into iniquity into unto
[16:57] iniquity even so now you yield your
[16:59] members servants of righteousness unto
[17:02] holiness for when we were the servants
[17:05] of sin you were free from righteousness
[17:08] we did want any but we were servants of
[17:11] sin really I mean what fruit PEGI then
[17:15] and those things where Annie are now
[17:16] ashamed for the end of those things is
[17:18] death all that other stuff we used today
[17:20] but now being made free from sin and
[17:23] become service to God
[17:24] you have your fruit unto holiness and
[17:26] the end everlasting life for the wages
[17:29] of sin is death but the gift of God is
[17:31] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[17:33] Lord now remember this is not chapter 7
[17:38] this is a continuation of the letter
[17:40] that Paul wrote to the Romans we put
[17:42] that number 7 there and and it would say
[17:46] you know pause take a break he's fixing
[17:48] to change is 70 no he's not he's
[17:51] speaking to the same people as he was
[17:53] right here he says know ye not brethren
[17:56] for us be for them that know
[17:58] oh how that the law had dominion over a
[18:01] man as long as he liveth for the woman
[18:05] was how the husband is bound by the law
[18:06] to her husband so long as he liveth but
[18:09] if the husband be dead she is loosed
[18:12] from the law and her husband
[18:14] okay naturally thanks beautiful right so
[18:20] then if while her husband liveth she be
[18:23] married to another man she shall be
[18:25] called an adulteress natural and
[18:29] spiritual that's what Dan basically was
[18:31] trying to get plenty coffee
[18:32] his wife was committing what adultery
[18:34] all right she was going after another
[18:37] man of course there's only one Satan and
[18:41] God only two forces we need to deal with
[18:49] so then if while her husband liveth she
[18:52] be married to another man she shall be
[18:53] called an adulteress but if her husband
[18:55] be dead she is free from that law so
[18:59] that she is no adulteress though she be
[19:01] married to another man now look that
[19:03] husband's gotta be dead now in the
[19:05] natural I heard him preach dick well my
[19:08] wife's dead because she's nothing to me
[19:10] no he's your life sucking air or your
[19:13] husband suck in there he still lies same
[19:16] way with God yes say it still sucking
[19:19] air in your soul
[19:20] you're dead ok you can't man him I am
[19:23] but if he be dead can I say it that way
[19:27] he be dead if you husband be dad are you
[19:30] I'd be dead you can marry again and
[19:32] though she will not have been adulteress
[19:35] though she be married to another man cuz
[19:37] we were married to say yes we didn't get
[19:41] a divorce right the old husband had died
[19:45] and once that all husband died you freed
[19:47] American actor
[19:49] and spiritually I wear for my brother
[19:53] you also are become dead to the wall by
[19:55] the body of Christ now watch here that
[20:02] law of what killed you put you in jail
[20:06] that was your old husband it's right but
[20:09] I didn't do away with the law
[20:11] I stink another nation I was preaching
[20:13] somewhere maybe in here was talking
[20:15] about this new preacher some was talking
[20:18] about the it says being come dead to the
[20:22] law now that doesn't mean you take the
[20:23] lawn throw it away
[20:25] we all still live under law sorry but
[20:29] the law is in the liberty of Jesus
[20:30] Christ Paul's won't tell us that later
[20:32] on we have Liberty under that law but
[20:35] you don't do away with the law he just
[20:37] said up in do we do it alone God for me
[20:39] you can't do away with the law we're
[20:41] actually the only people that can live
[20:43] the law where the all the people that
[20:45] can understand the law because remember
[20:50] Jesus was the law giver the Bible said
[20:53] Judah he comes from Judah the law giver
[20:56] all right but it wasn't a law like
[20:58] written down at the 10 well like
[21:01] somebody said till the day they're now
[21:02] 10 suggestions there are 10 commandments
[21:04] so you know they're just 10 suggestions
[21:07] they watered it down so much you know
[21:09] God says you can't commit adultery said
[21:11] you can't kill to steal not this thing
[21:13] so anyway but if we become dead to the
[21:18] law by the body of Christ that he should
[21:22] be married to another even to him the
[21:25] race of the Dead would come up Jews
[21:27] crime that we should bring forth fruit
[21:29] unto God for when we were in the flesh
[21:38] nopal are we not on flex now yes we're
[21:42] still in the flash name okay
[21:43] we still got flash we still got flash
[21:46] but watch the motions of sin which were
[21:50] by the law did work in our members to
[21:53] bring forth fruit unto death
[21:56] alright cuz remember anybody that is not
[21:59] born again you're under the law because
[22:01] like I said it's not gonna be a law
[22:03] where you woke up in they go well now
[22:04] you smoke you drank you stole something
[22:06] you did no you just didn't believe why I
[22:09] say it that's all I gotta say you just
[22:11] didn't believe what is that and then
[22:12] eternal welcome but now we are delivered
[22:17] from the law that being dead wherein we
[22:20] were held this is a
[22:24] S&OP see really where we are now
[22:28] we used to be dead dead people now we're
[22:31] dead live people I mean really we are
[22:35] just as their dead people walking out
[22:38] there we're dead now because we got to
[22:40] be dead to Christ right all right to
[22:42] walk in newness of life watch where we
[22:44] are now delivered from the law that
[22:45] being dead wherein we were held we were
[22:48] day that's greater than dead then now
[22:50] we're live dead that we should serve in
[22:53] newness of spirit and non of the illness
[22:55] of the letter why shall we say then is
[22:57] the law of sin god forbid the law is not
[23:00] sin nay I had not known sin but by the
[23:04] law same way with us cut it with a
[23:08] condemn ur my brother L says it was a
[23:11] record keeper it kept everything you did
[23:13] you didn't do that she didn't do that
[23:15] you didn't
[23:16] right for I had not known lust except
[23:21] the law had said thou shalt not covet
[23:23] all right but sin taking occasion by the
[23:27] commandment wrought in me and all mayor
[23:30] of come dispenses that means a longing a
[23:39] desire a lust desire craving longing
[23:43] desire what for sin taking occasion by
[23:51] the commandment wrought in me all manner
[23:52] of come compte penances one without the
[23:57] law San was dead
[24:00] in other words there was nothing to
[24:02] condemn you know right and you have to
[24:11] be careful with this because I believe
[24:13] that that's where a lot of the
[24:15] denominations and even brother Dale
[24:17] brings it out that many people say there
[24:19] was no Santa County to people until the
[24:21] law came into effect comes remember ever
[24:24] having live under the law mm-hmm Enoch
[24:27] Noah all those people up until Moses
[24:31] coming to Mount Sinai they didn't have a
[24:33] long history but they live by the law
[24:35] their own self their self choice because
[24:39] Adam had the element you gotta make a
[24:41] sacrifice you got to do this you got to
[24:43] do that you can't do this you can't do
[24:45] that that was to me that was Adam that
[24:47] was Adam bringing into law that they
[24:50] lived them because you really didn't
[24:51] have Ten Commandments until Moses 101
[24:54] outside yeah
[24:55] hey bruh ham I think Jacob Joseph all
[24:58] those people never lived under a law
[25:00] written down thou shalt not thou shalt
[25:02] not that same time so a lot of people
[25:05] tainted to them but no you gotta have
[25:07] even before Adam there was a law because
[25:12] God said you do this this will happen
[25:14] you do this this will happen that's a
[25:16] law the law said if you don't go over
[25:19] 670 miles an hour you won't get caught
[25:21] the law said if you went
[25:22] seventy so one out I'm doing when I was
[25:24] 17 my little mouth put it in terms like
[25:27] that he broke the law he broke God's law
[25:34] first time Fran I was alive without the
[25:38] law once it was a living person but when
[25:45] the commandment came sin revived and I
[25:50] got it and look in the commandment which
[25:53] was ordained to life I found to be unto
[25:55] death
[25:57] that's what condemned or brought Israel
[26:01] the Ten Commandments
[26:03] that's what Israel lived and died under
[26:06] because he found it to be death once he
[26:09] comes up to his time he looks back at
[26:11] the law and he's like man I what'd he do
[26:15] why did he do under the law he killed
[26:18] Christian he killed Christian he'd have
[26:23] a New Testament didn't have nothing new
[26:25] he took that Old Testament and killed
[26:27] them very Christians that were supposed
[26:29] to be you know supposed to be and they
[26:34] were ordained alive they were a
[26:35] Christian they were born again people
[26:37] and he was prosecuting or persecuting
[26:39] them and prosecute because he founded
[26:42] them to be death once he got him looking
[26:44] at him looking on the road to man to
[26:47] Damascus he saw he said Lord so he knew
[26:54] that he was talking to Jogja right here
[26:59] comes all the law I bet you when Paul
[27:03] was laying on the ground he was like I
[27:05] didn't commit adultery I didn't commit
[27:06] this I didn't do this I didn't do that I
[27:07] didn't do it come here was why he was a
[27:09] Jew he was old he was a law he was under
[27:12] the law so I mean yeah and his brain is
[27:16] like I didn't do this I than that but
[27:18] Jesus said he's the Lord who out there
[27:20] he said I am Jesus who you are
[27:24] persecuting and buddy you're talking
[27:27] about a roman camera went off and Paul
[27:29] whoa because what he was gonna do he I
[27:32] think just for me Paul was going water
[27:37] who worked out he was gonna say well I'm
[27:38] Jehovah the old a knight thou shalt got
[27:41] this and thou shalt not too happy when
[27:44] he said thou are persecuting me who them
[27:48] Christians Paul got a whole new
[27:50] revelation of what he was doing
[27:55] cuz he was killing them under the law
[27:57] and he was dying under the law because
[28:00] well because what he was went to Nord
[28:02] Angela I found him to be unto death for
[28:05] sin taking occasion by the commandment
[28:09] deceived me and by its looming wherefore
[28:15] the law is holy and the commandment holy
[28:17] and just and good there's nothing wrong
[28:19] with the law gun rody was then that
[28:24] which is good made death unto me
[28:27] God permitted but sin that it might
[28:31] appear sin worketh death in me by that
[28:34] which is good just what I explained we
[28:37] thought he was doing the right thing he
[28:39] could read it in the scripture he could
[28:41] read it in the Old Testament he knew
[28:43] what it was where it was coming from but
[28:45] yet his revelation persecuted the
[28:47] Christian yes they might appear but send
[28:51] that amount of pierced him worketh death
[28:53] in me by that which is good that sin by
[28:56] the commandment might become exceeding
[28:59] sinful the exceeding sinful part is is
[29:03] what he would from he was persecuting
[29:05] Christians didn't even know well they're
[29:09] not they're not you know they're not
[29:12] Sabbatarians and they're not you know
[29:14] they're not worshiping Jehovah and
[29:16] they're doing this and they're doing
[29:18] that it was a long pause pause zealous
[29:22] of the law but he found out the law was
[29:27] what was killing him then threw him
[29:30] killing the Christian saints but
[29:34] Pearson working death in me by back
[29:37] which is good that's the law it's good
[29:41] yeah but it was working death in him
[29:44] because what we just what we were just
[29:47] talking about that stand by the
[29:49] Commandant might become exceeding sinful
[29:51] see while they aren't doing this so
[29:54] we're going to persecute them anywhere
[29:56] there there there
[29:57] he called them centers yeah he called
[30:01] them centers because of the law he
[30:03] called them sinners yes but he found out
[30:06] he was one for we know that the law is
[30:11] spiritual but I am carnal sold
[30:13] understand what the lost spiritual but
[30:17] his carnal interpretation of that law
[30:19] it's what made it but I am carnal sold
[30:24] under sin what he knew that in his mind
[30:28] his carnal mind was what was killing him
[30:30] right for that which I do not allow not
[30:34] for what I would that do I not but what
[30:38] I hate that it now at this time Paul's
[30:44] born again so he what he's doing though
[30:45] he Rimmer he's writing a letter to the
[30:47] Romans telling them his experience
[30:52] that's what defends the whole thing's
[30:54] been his experience under his experience
[30:56] under the law being dead coming out of
[30:59] the law being alive in Christ but being
[31:02] dead in Christ right but now for that
[31:05] one that which I did I allowed on now
[31:07] what's he talking about he's moved out
[31:08] into the next man into that middle man
[31:12] so she can't stand in your soul be born
[31:14] again
[31:15] God can't sin so you can't go back into
[31:17] that for that which I do I allow not for
[31:22] what I would they do I not but what I
[31:25] hate that I do yes then I knew that
[31:29] which I would not in other words you
[31:32] find do the things I shouldn't I can
[31:35] sent unto the wall then he's good cuz
[31:39] the law says you can't come in adultery
[31:41] don't don't touch a girl he knows the
[31:46] law of him
[31:46] magnify Jesus that I say into um them if
[31:49] you look along to the left after you
[31:51] come into don't you whether now look it
[31:54] is the no.of now then it is no more I
[31:57] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[32:00] oh my goodness Paul ain't coming myself
[32:05] any no my soul leave so much that spear
[32:08] round man can't be talking about the
[32:11] soul sand can't dwell in your soul if
[32:14] you're born again but send dwells in
[32:18] your memories and conscience faces
[32:21] imagination before I know that inmate
[32:24] that is in my flesh not my flash but in
[32:26] my flesh like I said before forget this
[32:30] thing this thing only does what that
[32:33] ends I got tell it to do
[32:34] all right for I know that in me that is
[32:39] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[32:42] Paul you just told us back up here one
[32:44] scripture before that we're dead in
[32:46] Christ and alive and I mean we're dead
[32:48] to sin we're alive in Christ and
[32:50] everything's good and happy and
[32:51] wonderful in the soul that's the truth
[32:55] but Paul is telling us do other than no
[33:01] good thing for to will is present with
[33:06] me the soul wants to the soul no the
[33:13] soul wants to do this always want to do
[33:16] good fortune will is present with me
[33:20] what - will - will did everything
[33:21] everything I do is perfect and spiritual
[33:25] and according to God but how to perform
[33:30] that which is good I find not any
[33:34] veteran because he leaned to his memory
[33:37] lane this conscious in Linda
[33:39] say listen this guy couldn't forget what
[33:42] he did to those Christian that's right
[33:44] and now haunted him all of his life what
[33:48] he did because you know what the sins I
[33:49] made haunts me it doesn't all die that's
[33:51] right it haunts me but when we realized
[33:55] though that we've moved from that for
[33:58] the good that I would I do not souls
[34:03] always did
[34:04] if you mourning and your soul is always
[34:06] good your soul never does anything wrong
[34:08] yes man but when it comes out through
[34:11] that filter you got another man coming
[34:15] in from this way or another spirit
[34:18] coming in from this way that's the same
[34:20] way with him for the good that I would I
[34:22] do not but the evil which I would not
[34:26] that I knew Paul now watch it now if I
[34:36] knew that I would not and there's no
[34:39] more I'd to do it but sin that dwelleth
[34:41] in me followed up Paul knows all right
[34:43] he's not talking that it's all but in
[34:46] his spirit around with Santa per day
[34:48] that's what he's thinking but remember
[34:53] and here's another paradox we've got to
[34:58] take what Paul said and change that
[35:01] middle name he can't change that middle
[35:04] name at one time it wasn't the place he
[35:07] wasn't in the Eagle Age he didn't have
[35:09] the word even though he wrote the word
[35:10] he didn't have the word to take that
[35:13] middle and and do away with sin so
[35:16] that's what you and I did take a lot of
[35:18] change that middle man's who we got to
[35:20] work on it's all about already change
[35:26] fleshes just here to hold everything
[35:28] together except mental got where the
[35:31] Bible is look because I find that along
[35:35] then what I would do good evil is
[35:39] present with me all right
[35:42] same way with all those if you can't
[35:44] relate to live then you're either not
[35:45] born again or you just digna even that's
[35:52] not bad if you stay England you it
[35:56] becomes the other word evil this
[36:00] practice of the same way with all of us
[36:03] Friday light in the law of God after the
[36:07] inward man that polities watch he's
[36:10] taking this thing and he's bringing it
[36:11] right over and tonight in my soul I
[36:13] delight in the law of God after the
[36:17] inward man but I see another law not in
[36:21] the flash not a soul but I see another
[36:25] law in my members warrior guests along
[36:31] my mind where do you lose your memory
[36:34] from you mind because remember this is
[36:37] the paradox in your soul that person of
[36:41] your soul you don't remember sin
[36:48] it can't if it's Almighty God he can't
[36:54] sin didn't singers and can't ever seen
[36:58] is that alright so when you think of
[37:02] thought this contrary to God he didn't
[37:04] tell me as oh I promise you
[37:06] frogs a lot of the Gulf law of God after
[37:08] the inward man but I see another law in
[37:10] my members warring against the law of my
[37:13] mind and bringing me into captivity you
[37:19] said there long enough and in your
[37:21] memory the things you've done it will
[37:25] captivate you and you'll think you're
[37:28] the worst centered ever lived
[37:30] and you were and you are just go ahead
[37:35] and minute you were but that this man
[37:38] that's in the soul he's going once and
[37:43] you don't man I mean read me all that
[37:47] stuff that we did sure we remember it
[37:50] sure we did it in our flashes right but
[37:54] if you're born again this soul person
[37:56] never did it phase one speck of sin in
[37:59] that soul you're not born again that's
[38:01] right
[38:03] eternal as God is pure as God is and
[38:06] perfect so it can't be eternal without
[38:08] being perfect all right so you come from
[38:10] there's that I'll tell you same thing
[38:12] right
[38:13] Friday light is the law of God after the
[38:15] inward man but I see another law in my
[38:18] members warring against the law of my
[38:20] mind what yes you can know you can know
[38:23] you can't yes you can and bringing me
[38:27] into captivity to the law of sin which
[38:30] is in my members Paul I don't you the
[38:32] born-again Christian
[38:33] I am I just have a problem in that
[38:37] middle round okay
[38:44] Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall
[38:49] deliver me from the body of this death
[38:52] he's asking the question
[38:54] I save God through Jesus Christ our Lord
[38:57] that's all he can do I'll end up do
[38:59] Jesus Christ our Lord knowing that's his
[39:01] Redeemer so then with the mind I myself
[39:04] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[39:07] the law sin because remember you don't
[39:18] need your soul I'll bring it out there
[39:22] some won't bring that but another goes
[39:28] remember with my mind I myself serve the
[39:33] law of God that way something I don't
[39:34] know watching in my mind but look he's
[39:36] got another law warring against along my
[39:38] mind ok because remember God takes the
[39:43] heart saved chose the money right this
[39:47] is what's got to start being purified
[39:48] this is all ready for your fight at this
[39:50] morning in done alright yeah let me read
[39:54] now the dialog just for a few minutes
[39:55] and let's see what it says here all
[39:59] right are you a nut brethren for I am
[40:03] speaking to those who are acquainted
[40:05] with the law that the law controls a man
[40:08] for as long a time as he lives
[40:12] hence the married woman is bound by law
[40:15] to the living husband see that's pretty
[40:17] clearly not God but if the husband died
[40:19] she is released from the law of the
[40:22] husband so then while the husband is
[40:26] living she will be declared an
[40:30] adulteress if she belonged to another
[40:33] man but if the husband died
[40:36] she is free from the law so if she is
[40:38] not an adulteress though she belongs to
[40:40] another man
[40:42] wherefore wherefore therefore my
[40:44] brethren ye also were put to death by
[40:47] the law through the body of the Anointed
[40:49] One in order that you may belong to
[40:52] another
[40:52] to him who was raised from the dead that
[40:56] we should bring forth fruit to God verse
[40:58] 5 for when we were in the flesh those
[41:02] sinful passions which were 3 the law
[41:05] worked in our members to bring forth
[41:07] fruit unto death but now for 6 having
[41:12] died
[41:12] we are released from the law by which we
[41:15] were held so that we may serve in
[41:18] newness of spirit and not an illness of
[41:20] letter that what then shall we say is
[41:23] the law sin by no means indeed verse 10
[41:26] says verse 7 indeed I did not know sin
[41:29] except to the law very clearly for even
[41:33] for even strong desire I have not known
[41:37] yet the law had not said that stop not
[41:40] cut it her faith but stand having taken
[41:43] opportunity through the commandment
[41:45] worked in me an all strong desire apart
[41:48] from the law however sin is dead
[41:51] verse 9 and I was formerly living apart
[41:54] from the law but the commandment having
[41:57] come sin lived again and I died verse 10
[42:01] will stop within that commandment
[42:02] intended for life
[42:06] the same was found by me for death I
[42:11] mean
[42:17] [Music]
