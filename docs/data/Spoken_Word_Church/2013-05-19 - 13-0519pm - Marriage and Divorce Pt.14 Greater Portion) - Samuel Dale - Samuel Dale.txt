your word now we're totally dependent upon you and it's not in anything that we could do or anything whatsoever it's all resting in you and we believe that you will do what you promised because we we believe your word we love you and we thank you have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us from all unrighteousness in Jesus name amen enjoyed the kids with the with the taking over the services today and the singing and the and the things I really do appreciate it Matthew 19 three through nine and the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever calls and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife in day twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh or therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorce and to put her away and he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever married her which is put away doth commit adultery now let's go over to Romans 7 1-6 no you're not Brethren fire speak to them that know the law as the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called on adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'll be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye are also become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word will enjoy brother Jonathan being with us and speaking for us and pray that the Lord will take care of him on the highway home give them a safe journey now last Sunday we tried to cover apart and I want to review that because I believe this is a very important part of where we're coming to in our understanding and and I pray and beg please to those that you know don't come ever service and get to be here that they'll please listen to the tapes and things and you know try to get an understanding because we're trying to deal with a lot of things and I believe it will be very helpful to us and people would ask questions you know and they'd say well brother Dale I've done this I've done this I've done that I've done whatever is there any hopes for me if you won't try there's not if you won't put forth an effort there is not God will not override your free moral agency and make you accept anything a pardon is not a pardon unless received as a pardon Joe if he makes a way and why wouldn't anyone want to make a way we were talking last night about something on it and it was mentioned uh somebody did about you know that uh some brother had said well his kids had went out and done wrong and things like that and and said they were you know we're talking about coming to church and the one brother had said well I don't want him in the church my other brother said well that's the only hope they have there is no hopes outside the word of God there is no hopes outside of this message so if you go off and leave and do and forget it then there is no hope see because you make your own brother Tom fabush used to say that you trigger your own predestination that was his way of saying it because the life you live they will prove what we are and what we're Desiring so if we don't desire a pardon there is no pardon for us yeah but I just can't see how so and so and I've I've been told you know that with one for person who said that we would just all here at Lula going to die and go to hell because we let people come here that had marital problems well I hadn't closed the doors yet you know I just keep saying because I believe that's the only host people's got is the word of God I don't believe there's any hopes out in the world for us you know we're not talking about an Alcoholics Anonymous thing and trying to quit drinking or something you know and uh but I just and and I've always said what I believe you know that way you don't have to go off say well I don't know what he believed I don't believe American marriage and divorce situation is blaspheming the Holy Ghost now if you turn it down sure you turned down the grace of marriage and divorce been given then you have blasphemed why because you prove you're an unbeliever because a True Believer can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost seeing we don't look at the scriptures and try to study them to understand we just somebody said something you know about something and they said well as long as they do this as long as they do that there's no hopes well you know one of these days God's going to look at all of us in the same light I believe he does anyway but you know and uh we might find out that a lot of times I found this to be true let me state it in my own language that uh a lot of times people who fight something real hard are people that have got problems and this one certain brother one time brother moat was he and I this brother was real hard about things and I suppose a brother like that and he said I don't know either because he's got the problem itself and I mean I had to admit I said wait a minute are we talking about the same brother and he said yes I said well why is he fighting so hard he said because he's got the same trouble well you know what a lot of people sometimes do they fight like that to try to find truth they're searching but they don't know how to search so they try to fight it you know and maybe somebody can speak something that would help them to understand but you know I I pray that there's Grace for everyone but I don't believe in sloppy greasy Grace you know disgrace I believe in true Grace of God all right in this afternoon I want you to do me a favor and especially this message if I can get the point to where I want it I want you to do me a favor I want you to think about what I'm saying and I'm saying it up front see where that you won't set your mind because I know what happens to the human mind when you cross someone their mindsets in a channel and there's nothing you can do to to change that no matter how much quote you've got or what you're doing once that mind is set in that channel it won't change until that person sees themselves and they back out of that situation some way or whatever the wording would be and and repent and see then 99 of the people are not going to do that right and I realize that but I want you to listen to the message especially the ending part of the message because I've seen something back a long time ago and I've tried to preach it and tried to say it and tried to get it lined up to where that I could say it and sometimes it takes 10 15 years to get there you know and that's no problem with me because I'm not no time creature when it comes to the word of God I believe in it but I want you to watch the ending of the message real good and if you miss it you you get your mindset and a channel go back and listen over again you know I would even suggest you listen to the day's message over the second time now that's how serious it is to me I'm asking you to do that you know because I want you to make sure you get the way I'm saying it all right then I'm responsible the for what did I bring I always am but I mean I want you to get what I'm saying then you can say well you said it that's all right so keep that in mind now we were talking last Sunday about something to me that is very important and uh it's some statements that the prophet made in The Invisible Union and we will get more and more time into this message so I would ask you to read it I've read through it the past couple of days and studying it and notes writing and doing things and you know just getting a few things in line and uh and we might even play the whole message one day just play the tape to make sure you'll follow what I'm saying you know through the message in all of the invisible Union all right now the last thoughts we were talking about is a little thing the prophet said go ahead brother Joe and pull up our brother uh who's talking about Bob I guess who's missing what I miss her who's back there and uh but we gave this quote and you're going to read this quote three times in the message today all right now we won't read all of it we're going to read sections and then we're going to Maybe cover the whole thing but roll it up where they can see the bottom this is invisible Union priest in 1965 1125 paragraph 36. We will be dealing with 35 in just a minute this is where we were at the other day but now I believe also is to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy the r-o-p-h-e-c-y all right now there is a difference in Prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y and p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y we went through that last Sunday Paul uses it I'll show in the scripture in a minute in the same verse he uses both words in the same verse all right p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is the bringing together of all of the scriptures all right we'll go back through what we read last Sunday but p-r-o-p-h-e-s why is somebody telling you that does everybody understand all right now brother random didn't say this is a p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y he uses to see why because he's telling you something see one of the great mysteries of Prophecy and he said I hope the Lord helps us tonight as we deliver this to our waiting people across the country prophecy you remember we gave it I didn't give it to them to get back over again which is all right the word prophets feel p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is used a good many times in the scripture and it comes from the number 43 94 of the strongest Concordance it says prophecy in other words a discourse intimating e-n-a-m-a-t-i-n-g which really means to come forth or originate so it's a discourse originating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God whether by reproving or admonishing the wicked are comforting The Afflicted or revealing things hidden especially by foretelling future events now that's p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y-p-r-e-p-h-e-s-y is the person who speaks all right now the prophets would bring their message they would speak it p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y that's they were speaking that message from divine inspiration all right then that message that I was trying to say Sunday must tie together every scripture must tie together all the way through the Bible it must tie together and it makes one p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y all right nobody understand it makes one discourse bringing forth or showing the purpose of God or or the scriptures being expressed and explained to give us an understanding see that way then we believe the Bible to be as I say you start in Genesis with a white dog you wind up in Revelations with a cat or something everybody's okay we got an animal but that ain't the Bible he's got to wind up with not a black white dog and Genesis a black one in Revelation that's not right you got to have the white dog an Indian and a white dog you understand you've got to have the same thing you can't start out with one God and wind up in a trinity you'd wind up like a man at work one day at Pentecostal and I thought man I done really hit something I said I knew what church he went to you know and I said you're talking about water baptism the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said yeah well I knew they didn't do it see I've hit me somebody to talk to I said you know nowhere in the Bible was anybody ever baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost he said that's right he said I said Lord churches baptized father son the Holy Ghost he said yeah we do now you better help me Lord but anyhow he said the reason was he said back dire they were trinitarians and said they had to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said but we understand God so we go to the father son Holy Ghost goodbye I really lost that one all right now see he thought he had it all tied together but see he had two different things right okay now if you got two different things in the Bible remember what you got you got the Antichrist because that was the way the prophet knew when the white horse rider rolled off he said here's stand in the land with a book in his hand there goes the white horse rider look at that fella that guy he said Darby's another person two persons in the Bible one of them is Antichrist all right now so a a discourse or a study or a presenting of one's thoughts coming forth are originating from divine inspiration to bring to us the purpose of revelation of God all right now all the scriptures in must line up together or it would not be the same revelation you remember the prophet said each Prophet lined up his message by the prophet prior to him now did they necessarily have the ability to read what the man behind them or was it just Prophet just illustrating the the correctness of the word that no matter if they even did not hear the other one that they would line it up and it would come through so beautiful to make a beautiful picture all right now now have an odd way of taking it but I want you to think with me for a second see then this seventh Church AIDS messenger Sabbath angel now I'm trying to illustrate okay I'm going to do a lot of illustrating and I'll read it a minute while we illustrate and to illustrate is to take an example and explain it to take a type and show the anti-type to illustrate you know the show all right now this seventh Church age messenger has no certain mystery you've heard that quote go ahead and pull it up Brothers in the first seal number two there notice what he says it happened under the messengers arise on Earth what it's a great plan until it comes to the last angel now he has no certain mystery Now read this real carefully because you you've got two thoughts here that if you don't get them together you're you're messed up so listen this last Angel has no certain mystery will these folks bring all the mystery we're going to read what he says but he's got to bring it's got to be a certain way but he gathers up all that's been lost in the mother ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet see as a revelation come then he reveals those things in his day if you want to read it then you go to Revelations 10 1. and you'll get it now read the rest of it let's go to the next paragraph takes a book of seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel now and we just come through the church ages with even history and prove that see it is the Angel's message of the seventh Church all right Reveals All the Mysteries that's been in this past all the things in the past Revelations 10 1-7 that's to be now listen to what he's saying see when I made this statement do you looked I guess this messenger this seventh Church age messenger and no certain mystery amen because he was to take all that was left over of the Mysteries now divide the message of brother Branham and you'll see what I'm talking about in 1963 he had come to the position to explain all the Mysteries that was left over in the church ages follow me then his message came through the opening of the seals right right this message of Malachi 4 is going to do two things they're not answer the children back and reveal the seven Thunders all right now to get the point me he has no certain mystery the seventh angel the seventh Church age messenger now brother Branham was not the messenger to lady osia I don't have time to explain all these I have over the years the Holy Ghost came on zeusa Street he says no messenger the age 464 seal book go read it all right you say yeah but he preached to the cemetery he brought his message he had to come and restore what they had left off or explain what they had left off then the seals broke to him and he brought his message to explain the entire Bible now these things are very important because listen if the Bible is a prophecy if it's a prophecy puree p h e c y all right then that will tie together what we're talking about because in the invisible Union brought a random made a statement that was outstanding to me and always being that really helped me I didn't bring it but I think it's paragraph 29 or something it's an invisible Union he said Matthew Mark Luke and John he said they wrote what Jesus said but he said Paul put the New Testament together wrote it well that stuck with me you see he said well didn't Matthew Mark Luke and John write the New Testament they wrote what Jesus said you understand it they wrote what he's saying then Paul comes and ties together the Loose Ends well see here comes brother Brandon with his ministry and God is leading him to tie together all of the Loose Ends of all of those Angel Messengers left off Through the Ages the then his message came to finish the Mysteries marriage and divorce Rapture serpent seed Etc all these are quotes were revealed in the seals all right revealed in the prophecy see all it down to that those others had said we're not completely finished so not only do writings of the Bible of Paul and Peter and him and then even the church ages coming down still having things there were still some things left off from even the Old Testament Saints the Old Testament prophets they were preaching and pointing down too and bringing it prophecy that would lay perfectly in order and then here would come the seventh churches Angel not the one to bring this to speak the mysteries of the ages the message of the Prophet that began he said in 63 of the opening of the seals read the Rapture message and not in the beginning but said when the Mysteries come forth all right see then the Bible was sealed up right the prophecy was sealed up when the prophet came he began to explain those Mysteries the prophecy was becoming from letters on the page and thoughts into a revelation Daniel 9 and 24 says seal up the vision and prophecy p r o p h e c y then say p r o p h e s y because that would have stopped you from talking Daniel was told seal up the prophecy were until the end time all right then it would come into the end time and then you would have in the Bible everything would be getting set in order if you realize where we're standing folks you and I are standing with a book that has been explained to us right that is sealed away from the world because they do not know the prophecy see they don't know the truth of the word they sealed away to them it's only revealed to the bride right he said well these others can preach about it Matthew Martin Luke and John could write about it but they wasn't chosen to put the New Testament together yet they had the baptism in the Holy Ghost and John goes on to Patmos yeah Paul was chose to put it together he brought the prophecies into his message and preached Christ in you the hope of glory bring in examples of all of the types the Shadows the things that the prophets had said Matthew Martin Luke and John wasn't chosen to do that the Apostle Paul was chosen to write that we see the Ages come down those great men and great Revelations that they brought from the word of God but they were not chosen to stand in the end time with the opening of the seals and show that their prophecy was correct what do you think brother Adam meant when he said if Martin Luther was here today he'd believe this message but yet he says he did not have justification in his total understanding he said in the seal books if you've got a mystery of justification sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost that they didn't even understand yet they preached it because it could bring the prophecy together they couldn't see it all tied together they just read and preach and that's what mankind does and that's the way the preachers of the message do but in Romans 12 and 6 Paul says whether prophecy PRC why let us prophesy the r-o-p-h-e-s-y if we understand the prophecy we could prophesy we can talk about it right but that's the reason people don't talk about it they don't understand it but yet it's true right right God's word is real this message has the answers because this message brings together the prophecy and then someone had to speak it for it to be made known into our hearts second Peter 1 and 19 Peter says I was up on the mountain I saw these things but I was more sure word of Prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y go and look it up see he said the Holy Ghost that Jesus according to John 14 26 says he'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever I said and teach you things to come Peter said I've got a more sure word of Prophecy I've got the new birth and that new birth will bring to my understanding what I have need of and it will show me the prophecy then I can prophesy about it I could tell about it you can only tell about what's revealed to you right you see we're trying to get across last Sunday Revelation 1 and 3 says blessed are they that hear the words how many times are read that I read it 90 something times the mayor in the series just prior to this The Book of Revelation they're read at 96 93 or four times hear the words of this prophecy we're talking about prophesying it's talking about a prophecy all the Bible is coming down to reveal one thing revelation 22 and 7 said to keep the sayings of the prophecy of this book things of the prophecy the whole book is a prophecy Revelation 19 and 10 says for the testimony of Jesus Christ is what the spirit of Prophecy p r o p h e c y see if that is said p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y then you'd be dealing with anointed ones because anointed ones are are talking saying things but they're not saying it according to the prophecy they're not keeping the words correct that's the difference the anointed ones and the genuine the genuine would stand with the word the others are just prophesying you're speaking hitting and missing right around says that this is a prophecy Romans 7. is a prophecy now I'm going to say this and I'm going to go over it time and time again for the mark and I we're talking one day going down the road and he said brother Dale I see that the whole Bible is marriage and divorce yeah this video right the whole Bible is marriage and divorced the whole Bible is a new birth the whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ now let's look at paragraph 35 of the invisible Union number three brother Joe I told him I said put this three times in here now he's he's trying to figure it out see before I got in there to tell him what I was intending to do with it so this is he ain't got it right something's on him that's his Christ's mystery paragraph 35 of the invisible Union how are we getting it now okay Paul here is illustrating now I'll back up on this in a minute again but what is illustrating you're you're taking something and you're illustrating it you're explaining it or or are doing with it you take a a round does it by every sermon he he takes an Old Testament and explains it to the New Testament right Paul was what he was doing taking his writings and explain you're illustrating it you're trying to make a picture out of what you're doing now he's talking about Romans 7. Paul here is given an illustration in our scripture Romans 7 that's what he's at about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce watch now but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order here that we as a church can no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband and I have my own ideas and thoughts on that but a greater portion but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce that's what I said you better stay with me this afternoon because please don't Tang on my words and just do the best I can I don't have no education not if enough sense to be able to talk but yet sometimes the Lord speaks the prophet says that Romans 7 is a greater portion of marriage and divorce now you with me are you higher wake them up hard to listen while you're snoring now according to Webster you know dictionary apportion is a part of a whole see it's not all of it but part of it portion now remember what your Prophet said now so see you'll run across when I go across you'll miss it and you won't follow me he said this is Romans 7 is a greater portion of marriage and divorce yeah I've never explained some of these things I'm going to be in this afternoon I've preached up to him for years and had to back off because I didn't understand how to explain it if you want to say advise you I'd listen to it over again now when you say a portion of anything you're saying that you only have part of it right you only have part of it all right now but when you say a greater portion what does that mean the prophet said this is a greater portion of marriage and divorce a greater portion would be a larger amount you go with me I think Webster that's brother Dale talking okay a greater portion would mean a larger amount of the same thing or in other words the whole of it right anything above a portion which is a part you would be make dealing with more right and finally you would come to the whole of it now are you seeing why I've spent so much time last Sunday and started back over again today that a prophecy see if you cut the Bible in high if you've got a high for prophecy if you take all the Bible but leave out the Book of Revelations you only have a portion right right are you following me you don't have the pure prophecy you only have a portion anything outside of the Seven Seals in the Book of Revelations you're dealing with a prophecy that is not complete you're dealing with a portion or something see this message is not a portion this message is the entirety or the whole of the matter all that we're going to get while we're here in this world right is revealed in the seals all right so just trying to make a simple little illustration because that's what wrote around said he said now Paul is using Romans 7 as an illustration now we've totally got that backward s oh man that was shock you enough to get you to stay awake long enough to listen I don't really they'll understand that like you I don't mean this sarcastically I'm just I'm honest why would a prophet say that Romans 7 was only a marriage and divorce was only a portion of that that's what I said now you missed my wording you got a problem marriage and divorce is not the highest order now you know what I'm talking about marriage and divorce I'm talking about the physical okay everybody with me the natural does everybody thinks that's the Apex and I admit I used to think that back a few years ago it began to dawn on me why Prophet would make a few statements and then begin to ponder Lord we're missing the whole thing marriage and divorce the grace of marriage and divorce where you know go home as you are that's not the Apex or the Christian example instead you better listen today go back and listen again see when you say a greater portion run around and said it there he said Romans 7. that more or less spoke on his marriage and divorce he said but it's a greater portion of marriage and divorce now what is a greater portion of marriage and divorce what is a greater portion of it Mr Gale says brother they'll make you think okay see the entire Bible then would be the revelation of the new birth the one God to start with because you can't get anywhere without that part it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right because it's what we read in Revelations 1 1-3 there every time ready to revelation of Jesus Christ God give to Jesus to give to John blessed is he that readeth the prophecy of this book that's why we read throughout the things are in Revelations this is a prophecy all right what is a greater portion it means more of now you know I I love banana pudding but banana pudding used to be bananas and cream and whipping on the top now you bite into banana pudding you find pecans you find all kinds of things in and I love it it's good don't misunderstand me it's just illustrating so you say banana pudding and they're telling what you're biting down on but all goes together now if you're eating in the Bible and you eat a little bit of it it makes you want more but it makes you want more of the same thing so if you get something out of the Bible as a portion apart then the greater portion cannot be something different it's more of the same thing you remember like brother random talking about the black man about the watermelon said you know he said that was a piece of watermelon was good but said Auntie some more why because it just makes you want to eat just a little bit just a portion you know and uh you know you want to go but now listen what would be a greater portion of marriage and divorce when it would have to tie together to be more of the same I wrote it like this here's where you may differ with me on what I'll say today but pray before you let your mind Wonder on what I'm trying to say and self-interpreted it a greater portion go ahead with number four questions and answers law having a shadow priest 54 05 16. paragraph 8 30 e 18. he's coming down discussing with people you know and he said but you see he was a Nazarite or Nazarene because he was talking to somebody about the Bible all right and he thought that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what they teach we think that that the Methodist his sanctification John Wesley's teaching of sanctification was the teaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've read his own writing of it we think it's just all they call sanctification he taught sanctification was the new birth Luther taught justification was the New Birth you know what it was in that day all right so the man the Nazarene thought that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which it is not there's no scripture to show that I'll prove that in a little bit in the Bible see that it isn't you're not sealed by sanctification you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit a ceiling is the completing of the work that's the reason it couldn't be sealed under Luther or Wesley either one it had to come to the baptism before the church sealed away till the day of redemption didn't mean they wasn't saved down to there he's talking about the ages and the birth that it's to bring forth and look what he says he said oh they're not lost see he knew somebody's thinking that they're saying certainly they are sanctification is the same work of the grace are the same Grace that saved you Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and it's the holy spirit all alone but that's a portion of the Holy Spirit justification and sanctification is a portion of the Holy Spirit now I'm getting you to a point to think about why would he say Romans 7 is a greater portion of marriage and divorce that's the thought okay but it's greater poor this is a greater portion of the Holy Spirit what the new birth and then when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the completion of the Holy Spirit taking us up taking up its Abode in you now when you're Justified that's the work of the Holy Spirit right when you're Sanctified that's the work of the Holy Spirit that's the only part of the Holy Spirit but when you receive the new birth you received the very life of God which is a greater portion of the Holy Spirit but it's a greater portion of the same thing you started with at justification so when brother random is explaining then what's he saying Romans 7 is a greater portion of marriage and divorce see Paul is illustrating are given an example of Law and Grace he's really preaching on Law and Grace given the example of marriage and divorce now to illustrate according to Webster is to make clear or intelligible as by example all right go ahead with number five same quote we started paragraph 35 invisible Union here Paul is given an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce now which one is Paul speaking of is Paul speaking of marriage and divorce as the Apex or finality or is he speaking of Law and Grace being the finality if he's using marriage and divorce to illustrate it or give an example then marriage and divorces literally we're talking about for the bodies you know the things that you know that's not the Apex that's not the top so you may have to go back and listen to get the point look at paragraph 43 while you're at an invisible Union the illustration here showing the relationship of bride to Christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him horseshoe would come from and how that she would be brought to him the church here in illustration that we got in view is Illustrated by a woman now what who's he talking about the woman or the bride right come on I'm glad that said that see he's not talking about the woman he's talking about the woman but he's illustrating with her which is greater the top or the antetop only speaks of the answer type so if you're given an example your example is not the reality I'll bring my son out of Egypt that was not the real son right who was a real son when Jesus come out of Egypt that was a type Jesus was the antetop or fulfillment of the type so Shake Yourself now The church here in illustration that we got in view is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always the type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God so now he's not talking that's why we're going to get into it when brother Brown and we'll get back into invisible Union he said I'm not talking about you women he said whatever you are is between you and God if you read the message I heard him he said I'm talking about the bride of Christ okay look at the next one paragraph 81 invisible Union it's no better body being abetting ground and therefore it's a sacred Trust not to defile that now speaking now bringing this to an illustration copper Shadow example to show you where the church stands and Romans 7 to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking of you women talking about women Natural Women I'm not speaking of you women whatever you are that's between you and God are you men but I'm speaking of the church and Christ now Paul is speaking in Romans 7 his real thought his own glow and Grace we don't need to know about law and Grace we ain't never been under law that's what the Jews said I said we ain't never been unto bondage to nobody and at that exact time they were under Roman bondage right that's what they said Paul is talking about law and Grace and he's illustrating it he's given the example of marriage and divorce now whether you realize it or not if I was you I wouldn't holler amen God if you do then you trapped yourself because you just admitted you didn't know what you were talking about until I started sarcastic go ahead but I'm trying to get you to think for one time in your life sensibly let the Holy Spirit talk to you he's managing divorce the top Apex that ain't the way your prophet's explaining him marriage and divorce is not the greater portion marriage and divorce is what he's using to illustrate it he's typing with it he's given examples with it the highest order of all is Law and Grace First Corinthians 10 and 11 Paul speaks of how that these things happen to them for examples which was the children of Israel you take examples to show what you're talking about you don't take what you're talking about to show examples anybody with me you take your example to show what your thought is Paul is not explaining marriage and divorce in Romans 7. he's explaining law and Grace right his example is marriage and divorce the greater portion of Law and Grace well brother Dale always thought the greatest thing when we get these bodies figured out so you take an example or an illustration a description you use that to explain what you're really talking about this were to help us be able to study the message the whole message not just marriage and divorce see that's what everybody thinks they think if I just hear the marriage divorce I'm ready for the rapture how come you still got about a lot of questions about it how come are you still saying well I'm wondering if I'm free I don't know where I'm free or not I hope I'm free maybe I am I don't know now you better swallow you see I don't believe brother random needed the grace of marriage and divorce in a literal extent so I make that blunt plain plain plain blunt he kept himself his wife had kept herself and they didn't need that but when it comes to law and Grace what about it you use an example of something that has been now listen to the thought I wrote on it very important you use an example an illustration to explain what is now right there or will be to come right now say that again so you listen you use an example of what has been to explain what is or what will come everybody with me that's sensible see you use an example to see what the true is going to be when it gets there my hand makes a shadow right you remember the story I see my shadow on the wall of my hand I know what my hand will look like but I can only see the shadow to start with the Bible is a prophecy an example an illustration and all of them things happen to Israel for our example amen that we fall not after the same example of unbelief right but which is the most important the example of something or what is typing or speaking of which is most important well I don't really know I don't have to know all about this type from genotypes and this type of you don't know what you're talking about period anyway so just get on go and forget it that's not being mean or sarcastic that's telling it like it is it's time to quit playing everybody's talking about that we need to Rejoice we need to be upward I agree with you well how come 50 years ain't brought people up they took them down you can preach yours out and scream and holler people start screaming all them shouting is it done any good and hey I believe in everybody but I believe like I believe it's the way the prophet said it he said just make sure if you jump up now that you live right when you land right you come back down make sure you live right yeah because you know what I'm talking about people shout Glory Hallelujah boy they just run and the emotional people are the worst sinners in the crowd right you don't like that sorry that you think about life and people and you'll see what I'm talking about and know it was right among you in your own churches and things the ones that shouted and screamed in hollered has now gone out of the message right I love to shout and scream and holler but I want to know what I'm hollering about I want something anchored down in the word Paul was using marriage and divorce as an example for the greater portion that's one president said it tell me what he said Paul is illustrating this like imagine divorce we said this is the greater portion of marriage and divorce now let me explain that and then it'll take me about three months to preach it okay all right you could be totally free of your marital situation right because you believe it you could be not guilty of those things and be totally free how come we're still here after 50 years after it was said this is only some assessing simple questions that's all I want to know see we take it that Paul is speaking on imagine divorce and typing it by law and Grace that's not what he's doing that's not what brother Brown have done in indivisible Union he was taken marriage and divorce at the top and illustrating it his law and Grace are the invisible Union if you went in his wordings see then the entire Bible is a prophecy speaking of the end time when this message would come for you and I how many people do you think went home free the day that he spoke on the grace of marriage and divorce when I wouldn't have wanted said it he did he said it in that message and I gave it to you I don't know how many times he said it's got to be revealed to you blessed God I went there with three wives I come home I just had one that great prophet of course he was a little wrong here and he was a little wrong there and he needed to be straightened out there and I know better about than he does remember I put a whole service on that really too that if we can't put our whole heart on this message and we're looking for somebody else to come forth or whatever then our dependence is not upon what the prophet said and if we think brother random was wrong here and wrong dire and we ought to be following you could if you can straighten the prophet out you got to be greater than he was is that sensible see then Paul is using according to brother random and what we read imagine divorce as an example that her husband has got to be dead and that a man is bound by the law as long as he liveth we're just getting into invisible union now so don't worry about it Paul said a man is bound by the law as long as he liveth but if he be dead and said the woman is bound as long as her husband liveth but said if her husband be dead she's to marry with free to marry again only in the Lord so we're putting marriage and divorce as the antetop and all the rest of the Bible is a type and we got it exactly backwards according to Paul according to brother Branham all right according to brother Dale I just read it we read Paul and what he said we read right around what he was saying if we could just get that straightened out on marriage and divorce we'd be ready to go yeah well been 50 years pretty good amount of time to straighten out things you think so I'm honest Church there seriously please I don't throw off on nobody I don't condemn nobody because none of us you're going to find out when we get to the invisible Union you're going to find out that none of us can look down on anybody else and if you think you can you're the garbage can but listen Church if what I'm saying is right look what you're talking about that Paul is using marriage and divorce to give an example or speak of something or illustrate it of long Grace and brother random is using it in The Invisible Union and said I'm not talking about you women what you are between you and God he said I'm talking about Christ in the church you could be holy pure and righteous as I said a moment ago and didn't need one ounce of the grace of marriage and divorce did that put you in rapture no what we're saying is we want you to get straight right come on folks we came into the message when they preached is your wife worthy of the Gospel I'm going to run preach the message is your life worthy of the gospel and all the preachers were preaching is your wife worthy to gospel preacher get up and say we get them women lined up we'll be ready to go I got this message down in Walmart I'm not kidding do you want me to explain that part the preacher got up and preached it and we heard him you probably heard him and didn't pay no attention to it sorry he said I didn't have nothing but I was down in Walmart walking around and said it come to me and I got this message well I'm not saying it didn't but I wonder what he was looking at well not only can preach about women's clothes and hiring stuff that's all he preached about I'm sorry and he preached had come to Pulpit said women shall be saved in childbearing and just stop never explain the rest of the scripture I asked him later outside I said would you mind quoting the rest of that scripture he said why did I fret the scripture I said quote the rest of it where it says if she continuing the faith but of course know-it-all smart alec I'm sorry we'll tell you one thing about it it'll be off of my hands when we get to her but you see people that fool around sleep and they do everything else and then say well brother Dale said so and so you better be able to prove what you're talking about around here because we got the tapes left I've used that before and I'll use it anytime you say I said so and so we'll get that tape and plate if I said it I'll apologize if I didn't say it you are a liar I don't mind it but listen Church let me just say something real simple now please listen and run around and preach the grace of marriage and divorce he made an astounding statement that always wondered why he said it like he did he said the Lord told him he said tell them to go on as they are is that what he said did we just read that maybe 10 times during the marriage and divorcement he said tell them to go on as they are don't do this again but to go on as they are a man later said brother Branham said you forgave them people sins he said that's not far out he said that's actually what happened right right you need that quote he said that's actually what happened but I want you to show me in marriage and divorce come on out there internet here anywhere I want you to show me on marriage and divorce that brother Branham owned the book marriage and divorce ever talked about the woman being justified you want me out of this Pulpit send me the quote I don't mind sitting down because I'm tired tired of foolishness of people in their sissified way of quotings and doings and manipulating and deceiving the poor old women I wouldn't the one that said it a woman was a thousand times easier more to be deceived than a man of course you women don't like that how many I ain't gonna race around how many of them would you even admit it down in your heart that that Prophet was right when he said you're a thousand times more easier to be deceived why are you trying to be women preachers then okay brother random never said on marriage and divorce you're Justified for what you've done I set you free I want to quote he said go on As You Are now we don't believe that he was meaning go on as you are you had four wives and you got here and you go back home you got four right we don't believe that no they went home with one to a polygamous and have a lot of trouble he wasn't even talking to polygamous people in marriage and divorce now you tell me he was and I'll tell you you're a lying hypocrite he was talking to True Believers because he said this is for my father was only not a bunch of polygamists you know what I'm saying on that right he was not talking about the world and the polygamy people you're talking about people he said sitting there honest sincere people thinking what will I do do I divorce them do I go home well that happens he said God said tell them to go on as they are haven't you never wondered about this quote go ahead and pull up number eight haven't you never wondered what this quote is sayeth from the invisible Union paragraph 77-78 but because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a sacred charge from God my Redemption she's got character that she must not defile if she would marry them now what's he using natural woman right she is defiled for a lifetime no matter how much she is Forgiven come on she can't be justified come on I'll strike that in a little bit got a scripture on that in a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement but she cannot be justified in this life it's always with her she cannot be justified in this life it's always with her notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justify what do you think he's saying well brought it down what it was when we went to our marriage and divorced and I went back home I was justified I want to quote that's all I want in this life all right in this life you can't be it'll always be with her right we're not Catholics come on Catholics believe that a woman goes and she lives in an adultery and she does this or has babies or whatever she does she ready to get married she goes down to the priest the priest goes to of course you got to give a lot of money I'm sure but the priest goes through a lot he turns around and sprinkled thoughts on her turn around send her back makes her a virgin that's not me read your own get your read it I get mine by reading you want that I'll give it to you on the prophet's message because he's the one who said it that's the way I know it's right he said that's what they do man down the country not too long ago a few years back he had a girl in his church wanting to get married she couldn't get married because he'd have some problems he spoke virginity back into her wound he said okay for her to marry now I'm not that dumb you may be can you women maybe a thousand times more able to be deceived but I I don't believe you're that bad come on I don't believe you're that dumb but that's the way the Catholics believes it can be done you can't put back the virginity that's been destroyed brother Brown said to you woman he said and you boys he said you take that woman to your breasts you want this quote he said she makes an imprint that no other woman will ever fit now your boys Crow you me and Crow and think about the virginities you stole from girls and things you see that's why brother Dale don't play it on neither side I know I'm blunt and plain and sometimes they'll say things it's just outlandishly sounds bad but I'm trying to save your soul what you think about me is no problem I go home at night and I cry and pray Lord ain't there some way that I could preach this without having to say things brother said I got pages in here of snakes crawling over women and having and we don't think he was too mean did you see Church marriage and divorce is not the tops law and Grace is that Apex brother random didn't have to be forgiven on marriage and divorced in the natural but he was carrying a Baptist Bible quote him converting them to a Baptist Faith quoting him and him a prophet the whole time I see his words he said I used to think Jesus loved me and God hated me that's his words he said but I found out it's the same person he found that out by the revealed word to see girls there's no way you lose that virginity there's no way to put that virginity back that's why you're here in this world when we get into the message a little father you'll find him saying she's not only forgiven but said she's Justified that's why I want you to read that invisible Union over and over and over but it's got to be put together correctly just like what I've tried to put together today for you correctly marriage and divorce is not the Apex of our Christian experience it's law and Grace now where do you hear people talking about law and Grace where do you remember talking about marriage and divorce I'm just honest now that's out there on the internet but where is it always afraid of it pray to what afraid to expose how dumb they are as you see Church a greater portion justification is a portion of the Holy Ghost but it's not the greater portion sanctification is a portion but it's not the greater portion the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a greater portion then you've got a statue of a perfect man to grow and to get out of here to be in all of it to be a greater portion marriage and divorce is only used as a portion because that's only for the bodies and things but the greater portion is Law and Grace because we'll find out then the old husband must be dead that's for both male and female you bunch of males don't read invisible Union and think he's only talking about the women he said I'm not talking about you women he said I'm only illustrating it I'm only giving you an example you know marriage and divorce he said go on As You Are one invisible Union is where he said you're not only forgiven but you're Justified but you know what the day we go out of here in Rapture everybody around is going to know whether you've got two wives two husbands or whatever you've done right but I ain't worried about what everybody thinks about me around there I'm sorry I what I've done in my life I've done that's done I cannot erase that but I can sure cry for Grace I can sure cry for Grace Amazing Grace the greater portion is not the grace of American divorce it's the grace to separates us from the law that we could be married to Jesus Christ come on brother think on these things you say well brother Dave if you just had a better way of explaining yourself well I admit that I agree with that I wish I had but you remember I've been preaching to people for a long time trying to get people to see not marriage and divorce but Lauren Gray now I'll give you the a point to think on to Wednesday see then marriage and then the new birth sets your soul free you agree the new birth sets your soul free your marriage and divorce to set your body free but what about the old denominational husband right my Lord you think about brother Brown standing there screaming and hollering on the invisible Union that was not at the Tabernacle that was actually under Jack Moore's church or somewhere he was preaching on that and he was screaming to them people about organized religion and everybody's setting their ball home to an organized religion right everybody that I belonged to one but how many have walked out the door and said foreign the Bible there to read I believe that's right now if I'm wrong you quoted right said he said after what he's just got through saying says we've got to get out of the church get the church has got to get out of the message in and we got to get out of the church now how many people heard Prophet screaming and hollering about organized religion but how many of them got up behind him and said I ain't no Church of God no more come on the new birth is first marriage and divorce is second invisible Union is lost you realize he was telling those people that they were married to a denominational religion and her old husband was still alive and they would holler and amen how do you think he felt how do you think he felt he walked out of there and not a person come to him and said I'm not a Baptist no more I'm not a Methodist I'm not a Pentecostal I'm not a I'm going to follow the light no they didn't believe what he said that's why he said on the marriage and divorce he said this is for my followers only the ones who followed this message he said well we got Brothers what created me include a heart page five five thirty nines created me a clean heart that's what I need don't you oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me creating me you're a queen and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from not that Holy Spirit from me restore unto me I'm gonna get a prayer called we ask you to just go and be with Acer now let everything be okay bring him back safe home may he see your presence being with him because her mother would be enough to ask we love you and we thank you in Jesus name oh God anybody else would just have a knee cast me not alone crack off her husband he's been having a lot of blood pressure problem from the heart skipping well let's just believe it you know I remember somebody there's always had a lot of problems about believing that they were because they'd never been healed and never been delivered never been and I believe God come on the scene took her through a whole bunch of tests and everything that they thought was really bad well apply that the same to Tom okay just applied okay anybody else come in let's believe our club we send this prayer cloth believing that whatever be taken care of and all will be well we love you and we thank you in Jesus name can I say something foreign as I said how many people the day the prophet screamed out about organized religion how many walked out away from their churches no they went back thinking they were right I'm telling this is God's honest truth because it's been told so many times to 90 percent of you have already heard me say it the day I walked out of the Baptist Church I went to a church in this message I said that day I said God got me out of the denomination now I want that denomination out of me when what goods it done yet I think we all need just a plain old repentance you say Lord save me Save Me From Myself what hopes did those people have that day that Prophet spoke invisible Union they had the hope of Salvation and where did it go right on back to their Church thank you thank you a lot of times we don't need prior we just need to keep on doing what we're doing right I mean I get something working I don't like to change I don't know what that word is bipolar or whatever they call it you know you don't like changes I don't either you know if I'm doing something and it works I want to keep on doing it that way come show me it's a better way I said okay I'll learn that later his brothers that used to work with me adorable there they know for certain what I do they'd send me down I know 40 I had to learn 40 something jobs not to be able to just have we learned I had to run them I had to go to them after the line would start to take that job over and had to run 40 something different jobs in our area and uh they know what I do I'd go up there in a man to train me I'd do it the best way that I could brother dick if he trained me on the job I'd done what he told me to do but then when he got through you know I'd do it but then I'd start learning shortcuts the first thing you know I'd be just standing there laughing and talking and just you know just running a job just like a top well that kind of job that kind of change I don't mind you know it's something to open up but to start off I learned the way he said it well brother mulch spent a lot of time pounding this old head of mine this word and I learned the best I could learn I thank God for him never had an ill thought in my life about him because he taught me the word but it come at times and I had other brothers that really talked the world up that I walked with and preached with but it seemed like it's always been you need to walk alone well I love people but sometimes I Walk Alone not just myself but see that a way that I'm not dependent upon somebody else but I'm still thinking about all that he taught me how to do this and he taught me how to do that thank God for every preacher that I've ever said unto everybody for the Baptist all the way through that helped me to learn about Jesus Christ that I have to walk along and sometimes that's hard because you love Fellowship you love people I ain't worried about that part I'm just concerned about serving him being what he wants me to be what do you think about it come on brother how we pray we then brother Aaron has something he wants to say but I said foreign we just asked you Lord and to change things because we believe you no matter how far away our kids grandkids great grandkids whatever they are know how far they will go away from us Lord that still that link is tied there and that love we just ask you father to reach down and touch because his love he's cherished you bring her back we believe you father our brothers come tonight to just layer on the altar before you and that's what we lay we lay her there Lord for you to work a work and to bring our sister back forward we love you and we believe you we thank you in Jesus is your name don't believe rather than see anybody else before we just met I've been in a lot of hospital rooms and things where people were dying and some of them went on and died but I can't pray for somebody to die sister asked me said would it be all right for me to pray that that person passed on I said I can't pray that away I said we can pray and know and believe God touches the person they will God we will die but I can't pray for God take somebody's life and I can pray for restoration I can play for pray for restoring for people and no matter how far those kids go let that love that's in your heart go out to our tour no matter what you love them you love them you're the Aaron's got something he wants to say so a little something on it share with you I wrote a few things down Wade always told me that not to give the War and Peace version of it so I just want to take just a few minutes and you know most most of you know that I got laid off at the end of last year and I was looking for a job I was out I've worked for a month and then I found a job working over here the Toyota Denzel Place tag and Pendergrass and I applied to the University of Georgia and I've been over there for probably a month and lady in Human Resources I was talking to her and and she asked me said why and I she asked me about my background was and I told her and she said why are you in logistics and not in maintenance and I said that's where they put me and you just have to work where they put you I mean but she asked for my resume so I gave her my resume well I didn't hear nothing else from them and uh just listen to what brother Jonathan had to say this weekend sometimes you get desperate you get worked up about things but it's on the line the other day and working I just prayed you know I'm not going to worry about it just putting God's hands because he knows what he's doing and sometimes that's the problem we get in the way right well I got an email from UGA last week I didn't get a job from and I was like well Lord didn't want me to be there right but tags had eight positions for over eight maintenance positions open for over a year now they've got only got three left well when I got my got my 90 days in a tag I applied for maintenance and uh I told them it worked that I didn't get the job at UGA and my my team leader he really went to a bat for me and they said well go to talk to the maintenance supervisor named Herman he said go talk to him a big tall black guy so I went up front I wouldn't talk to him he said well you need to take the maintenance assessment to find out your background your your skill level and everything and uh I took that it's past Wednesday afternoon I went and took that Wednesday when I went in Thursday morning my team leader told me said you've got to interview with maintenance 9 15. well they got moved to two o'clock and I went in interviewed at two o'clock at four o'clock it was after four o'clock Friday afternoon my uh team leader come and told me May 28th I start from magnets attack yep well I just want to thank you all so much for your prayers and like sister Johnny we've talked about it a number of times and I said well if I don't hear from him about it today I'll hear about it more next week whenever it's going to be but uh I just thank the Lord that has finally come along and it's not always what you know it's who you know when I got a good buddy of mine named Daniel and he was a team leader in maintenance now he's an engineer at tag and you know a lot of it's amazing there's people that are qualified there but you know I've talked to them and they said well I've not heard anything from maintenance I've applied twice in the Harding thing for maintenance I've been there a lot less time than the rest of them but Daniel put in a word for me the first thing they done the first thing the question they asked me when I went in for the interview they said how do you know Daniel and they told me you know because I talked to him before and you know they put a good word for me but you know God works everything out because he not only what you know but God puts people in places to work everything out for you and people were were really amazed at how quick it was because some of them they have to wait a while to get an interview but I took the assessment one day had an interview the next day and I got my transfer came through the next day so it's just boom boom boom but I've been waiting a while but it just all worked out just so I just think the Lord I told the word of the day I was going to do this I won't get up just testify before everybody and I got me a prayer call today so y'all just pray for me I start the day after Memorial Day see that
