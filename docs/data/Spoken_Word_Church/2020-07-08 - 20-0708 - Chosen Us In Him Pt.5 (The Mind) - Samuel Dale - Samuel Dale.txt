the Bible study on the Saturday ok August the first I think that's right then always the second will be back in our regular services in time and we'll be having our communion ever getting everything back in rotation to where we've been before and trying to get it all to do so remember these things and this approach the Lord would bless visions one Father we thank you for this day in your grace and your love we thank you for an opportunity to be able to come together tonight and just talk about you we ask you that you to have your way with each one of us forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you you and Lord just bless each one remember the sick ones among us and just touch each one brother I all brother Dejan sister Mary and all of the different ones Lord that are sick among us and just we ask you to just fulfill your attributes that you had for healer and that's not a hard thing to ask for that's what you wanted to do just make manifest and this day and hour around the country that's your little bride gather in Goshen this she'll be safe and all of these plagues and things that are falling and gathering there in your word and that we can walk in a lot of your grace we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name Amen hope you enjoyed this past weekend I really did had a good time and all hoping you hoping you did okay Ephesians we've been reading this for a while but we're gonna try to place it together if we can so we go to Ephesians 1 which is read 3 and 4 lessened be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him who in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love heart now let's go to Philippians Philippians I want to try to pick this up and bring the thought together out of Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself to be of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross amen okay we want to go to Jeremiah see if we control these scriptures together Jeremiah 1 verse 4 and 5 he said then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou cometh forth out of the wound I sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word Amen so I want to try to get you know into I thought that we've been in for a while and you know covering it toward that we can can see the word of the Lord as it's made manifest in our day alright so if we were kind of little to the company just bear with us and and think about what we're trying to say we've been talking about for quite about for services as a fifth service talking on predestination all right and we went through a lot of things covering it you know and knowing that in this hour it's a great doctrinal issue of predestination nation of the Hmong the denominational world and in things and we went through trying to open up their eyes or our eyes to understanding and how to do we can see that we use Calvinism and Arminianism as the two thoughts of the religious world to come forth and you know they both try to preach salvation but they have a different way each one to Express and their thoughts well we're not trying to differ with nobody but trying to get a better understanding the world is divided pretty well in the point of predestination because some people believe that your predestinated you know that's that's it if God seen me saved I'll be saved so I don't have to worry about it but if he didn't and I'll just be lost well now that's taken to the one side of the view but what about the other side of the view to her that you can say well I sought after God he he chose me he accepted me and and I gave my life to him to you know to become a Christian and trying to get things into the correct order but now if what have we been trying to do God's thoughts are eternal he doesn't add to or take away from his thoughts so his thoughts are eternal now what he thought of is not always eternal because he thought of a world it's not eternal he thought of all kind of things he's out of a lot of people coming into the world and and they will never receive eternal life because you know that's that's the point but he told them not just because he thought of you you say well I'm glad to think about the fact that that God thought of me before the world every begun because we read diary we were chosen in him who in Jesus Christ the word before the foundation of the world all right and then readings Jeremiah to where he say you know I knew thee for dainty before the foundation of the world and all like that then we say well everything is is said on that and one group said everything is predetermined because that's what predestination says if something is predetermined alright now see then if you go on the point of predetermined you're gonna run aground in your scriptures but if you'll go with the truth of understanding what it really is so he said those who he foreknew he did predestinate all right so then predestination comes into view in a simple form of being the foreknowledge of God God foreknew now if he didn't for know then he's not God you know if he doesn't have the ability to be able to for knew all for know all things it wouldn't be that he would be God he'd be just like me and you and he'd be trying to change things and and do things different before knowledge he is the knowledge before of what it is the fact that foreknowledge then comes into view to where that God could look back now I saw this on a something another day and that's the hidden what I'd like to talk to that guy for a little bit but he was talking about foreknowledge in predestination and in his doing but what he was a saying was he said there's God's foreknowledge go forward or backward you know and I said well in my thoughts you know if his foreknowledge is eternal then it's true that it can go just as far back as it can go forward he said no no he just thought about this here no know if this you're talking about an eternal God with foreknowledge then what would be the difference and going back that away going that away because it's going to come in a circle and it's all going to come together one day to where the the past present and future is all going to come into one point right so then when we think about predestination as being that God stamped it predetermined it if we're going to be saved we're gonna be saved but if we're gonna be lost we're gonna be lost well now where would that be leaving what would you be doing by foreknowledge then you set yourself in a destiny form to think about well I can't change it why me try to well see that goes into the doctrinal ideas of mankind of predestination but if you go to the point of foreknowledge and think about foreknowledge as being first now if you think of predestination that God predestinated something be careful because you'd be pre determining right you'll be pre determining the destination and mankind would have nothing to do with it he said well our salvation brothers of the Lord it is right which you've got to accept it you got to believe it what's wrong with it see foreknowledge then can go this as far forward as it does backwards because it's foreknowledge of God all right but if you set it on a destiny basis which is what the word predestination means means a destiny set all right then if you put it on a destiny set then how can the Word of God come together to give us an understanding all right now let me do this before we start because of red DS and just let me give you because we believe that God sent us a prophet in and also we just read into but see we believe in this this is what I believe because it's what the Prophet believe now believes what the Bible said because what I just quoted those who he foreknew he predestinate so foreknowledge is the dealing of what we need to do and and then we can see a destiny can be set by God's foreknowledge all right foreknowledge then has to come first I've emphasized that over to you for week after week for knowledge has to be first because if it's freed if it's predestination first then your pre determining I don't care what you got to say your pre determining it huh let's see for knowledge then predestination is the destiny that you're going to and see if that come first it will be back here let's see God's foreknowledge lets him see and set your destiny because of his foreknowledge of the choice he knows you make all right so what is it predestination then looks back to for knowledge for knowledge sets back here and looks all the way through until it can make a complete circle to ties back to eternity all right sees in predestination is not a bad word if you understand it by saying that it's by foreknowledge but if you understand it that the foreknowledge has to be first do you understand my my point if you say predestination comes first now foreknowledge because if predestination comes first your destiny was determined for you got here you would not have a choice of salvation but by foreknowledge he could see and set the destiny and it would come out to be so what is it doing then predestination is a great thing to look back to the point of God's foreknowledge because see what I want you to see if you don't get nothing out of the message I want you to get a wonderful thought in your mind if you could you know if you can pound the predestination and make it to words you can say well it's this it's that it's that you know if I was meant to be saved I'll be safe I wouldn't have won if you get all that out of your mind and get down to the fact we were chosen in him but why did he choose us you don't hear that talk about it why did he choose us he had to have some reason for choosing us now we know for goodness and God help us to understand that it can't be something good that we are because the Bible says he's got none good no not one it can't be that way it has to be based upon some way for God to have it to set a destiny he has to set that destiny by knowing the choice and what it was and he knew that before the world ever begun he said well then do we have a choice we have the choice but remember he chose us all right that's fine but remember you must accept the choice you didn't choose him we didn't come into this world trying to choose God and we wasn't searching for him it was him searching for us right it wasn't God in the garden I mean Adam running around hollering guard it was God in the garden trying to find Adam you know all right we'll get it all straight it'll come out to a beautiful picture then we can see the Bible unfold all the way through all right and then see then do you understand once and then predestination cannot be your first out of line you have to have the thought of line as foreknowledge because if not you are going to predetermine see but if you put it foreknowledge and let him see what you will do right then you can talk about predestination okay now here's the thought I want you to consider for a moment as we get to that point God's thoughts are eternal right you can never have a new thought all right but as I said now everything he taught us not eternal so don't get tied up into all of that well I'm glad I was you know a thought in his mind you could be a thought in this mind of Satan was a thought in God's mind right he thought of Satan and all he would do so don't go that line get back onto the straight line of trying to follow it but I wanted to ask you a simple question this is the burden that's been on my heart all this week to try to express something to you does God change his mind about his word and don't answer because you may want to pull back your answer a little later because of the approach that I'll take there's God never change his mind about his word he said no because if he ever has a thought okay he ever has his dog that thoughts eternal but that don't make everything eternal just because he thought of it he fed in your mind and listen to what I'm talking about he learned the Bible it was a man one time think his name was his a car was a king or something he a prophet went up and told him that thus saith the Lord set your house in order you're gonna die he prayed cried out before God and I've got even where the Prophet said the people loved him and they prayed cried out and God sent the same prophet back and told him that I'm gonna give you 15 years well did he change his mind did he change his mind or did his mind come into view now you say by predestination that man was predetermined because God sent the Prophet to it to tell him thus saith the Lord you will not or are you going to die and he prayed and God came down and said I'll give you 15 years did God change his mind well it looks like he did but how can he change his mind when his mind is is his word in this words eternal think about it you ever thought about it I was looking to bear a little bit and I know brother Branham uses at 52 times where he speaks of the fact that prior changes things see now if we put everything on a predetermined factor like I told you when you got into the Armenian was in an army and the Calvinism doctrinal issues back in time it got back there so set it with people about predestination until they would not have a revival because they was afraid that their children might get saved now I'm quoting it from the book now I'm not my mum reading it of what they said they were afraid that their children might get saved when God might not want them saved he said now how dumb could anybody be well let me say it this way if you don't give your family a chance or people around you a change what are you setting it on you know what are you setting it on is this thing set and predetermined to be a certain way or is it my God's foreknowledge that he knows how it will be which way if you set it to the basis that it's got to be that away then let's go home we're wasting time you know let's forget it no it's not based that way then is it did he change his mind when that man was doing that by predestination that would say the destiny was set by the word of the Prophet that said thus saith the Lord sets your house in order you're going to die that means by God's predestination if you're going to put it in that form then that man had to die then he sent the same prophet how would you like to bend that prophet how would you like to be the Prophet might wind up like brother Adam did that time when he told that girl that was thus saith the Lord she was gonna live and she told her mom the next morning or something she was dying she's going home she died even brother branham I didn't understand it he went before God and and told him he said you how you all being an explanation he said he let me pout it out about three months and he come to me and told me what the story was saying I remember the girl said she was drowning in a outing they were having she'd got in the river and was drowning and they pulled her out of there and later on the bank and she was probably dead you know as far as by looking at her and all but you know by the time they got through we're getting the water out every time she raised up she lived a year longer the girl that he was said telling that she was going to live he said I gave her time to make up her mind well how are you going to put that in your predetermined factor I asked you how can you put that in a predetermined factor so you cannot do it that's what I'm saying but how would you like to been the Prophet they went down her and said set your house in order for thus saith the Lord you're gonna die he goes off and gone for a little while he's over praying and God comes down to him and says go back over and tell him and I won't give in 15 years now here's my point if you don't get nothing else out of the message we can just go on get the point of what I've been driving at which comes first predestination or for knowledge by predestination of a predetermined factor you cannot fit that scripture you would have to say it looked like God changed his mind but did he not your prophet saying prayer changes things you mean everything is so predetermined set on the factor that that everything is just set and this is what's going well what are we worried let's go home forget it but by believing in foreknowledge being first and then God by that foreknowledge could foresee and follow all the way through and see the destiny now listen that King was told set your house in order for thus saith the Lord you're gonna die you know what God didn't change his mind man died 15 years later right come on so did God change his mind arose his mind in the view did God know before the world what that man was going to do did he know before the world that he would send the Prophet and tell him to get it in order he's gonna die but yet he would come back and send the same prophet and tell him he was gonna live you see if you approach it by foreknowledge you can see that God by foreknowledge set back and saw and he knew he sent that prophet he knew he would go down there but he knew he would turn around and extend the man 15 years onto his life but the man would eventually die so it never broke the word the prophets word was right set your house in order for thus saith the Lord you're going to die why did it matter how long it took he gave him 15 years there's no way that God changed his mind he didn't change his mind and give him another way because his mind was not sat that away his mind was sat on the basis that by foreknowledge he could foresee what that man was gonna do and what he was going to do he could then predetermine it to be that the man would eventually die the prophets words was right you understand what I'm talking about when the Prophet told that girl that she was going to live the next morning she died did God change his mind no see that's one of the things the Prophet emphasized that we think predestination is discussed pushed put in a pot and push it through the other end and we come out some way and we have no choices to make that's another rod that's what he said I've read these to you he said that's not right but see by foreknowledge he could set back and see what you're now gonna do he could see you everybody sitting here today so I didn't know the brother and sister is gonna be here I didn't know you know I could kind of guess on maybe a lot of you to be here and I haven't ours the brother and sisters are with us not glad to have them I didn't know that back there another little boy especially back there with a sister and I said I didn't know that was he guarding you it before the world ever begun his doubts are eternal but remember the point what he thought of is not always eternal does he changes not no he doesn't have to change his mind his mind was set before the world you think God didn't set back before the world ever begun and look down and see that Hezekiah king and see what he would do would see that he would have to send that prophet right back to him but he would turn and see him to die later on after 15 years so he didn't change his mind see this whole thing is set on the basis of not my predestination by foreknowledge point of what we're going to do and not going to do it's the foreknowledge God determines by you and I see not his will that anybody if it's not the will of God did anybody be lost right he wanted everybody say the same price paid for everybody but then those who he foreknew would want him then that fondant would that would determine the destiny see now we want to put it cuz we want some kind of a something that we're great seeds or some kind of something that we are we're something special he nothing in this building special for nothing but just destruction you take what you want to and that's you thank you is good like I've always said they run a thing one time you know there's a joke about it but don't let me run a thing one time they've got to find out about the Dales did they come over here on the Mayflower you know everybody my family come over on the Mayflower minded to stowaway horse thieves in the back of one of the boats you see they nothing no good about any of us and I'm sure glad God's not looking at what we do and don't do but that man that King had a desire in his heart sure we know okay come on all we know is the stories a lot of times we take the Bible stories and we will and we bring out what we want you don't hear people bring out about him being that would actually change the point of what was taking place oh you hear out of the man there the King is what well he order died because got 15 years and he did he wound up being a rascal of a bad King and should have died yes the world would have been the children of Israel would have been better off had he died 15 years prior to them because he turned out to be a rascal but that's all we look at we look at something like that and think that's a great revelation instead of looking to the fact of seeing that that man actually touched God God didn't change his mind but he touched God prayer changes things come on if I didn't believe it that way what would the prophets say one day he said if you ain't got enough faith for gonna see you for you to believe for your children he said I doubt you've got enough for your own self oh did you get that one if you ain't got enough to believe for your children and then lost and going on into the world and do it come on somebody prayed for you somebody prayed for you it might have been great-great grandma right might have been somebody you never knew nothing but they were praying for their descendants he ever had God to speak to you about it I've always prayed for my children pray God save my children one day he spoke to me he said you'll be there with your offspring he gave me the scripture so what did I do I didn't quit praying because they still ain't all in yet I keep praying but I'm praying for him to fulfill his word now cuz he told me well see if we don't want to we don't want to get into those things but what about the Dalton family when the Prophet turned to them and said all your children will be saved one after the other they all came to the Lord maybe we're not praying correctly sure we prayed here we prayed this away we prayed God you come down we pray seriously because it's supposed to be we prayed God come down and do what you got to do to bring my family in put him in the hospital did the prophets say that about Billy Paul when he went to the hospital he was laying up in the hospital bed and he said daddy press he said you send you pray right is that supposed to be the story whether it was true or not I still believe it could I believe that's the way he talked he said you pray because you've sinned see predestination we try to set the destiny of something without knowing anything about the foreknowledge that precedes all of that and not looking back I mean I'm 80 years old if time goes on i lolled I write I don't think I'm gonna live to be a hundred because I'm not worried about it would you just get to Portland talking about looking forward to it I just know the fact that it's gonna creep up on or some of us right all right but see I ain't depending on that away that's a destiny I'm looking back to where I come from that's a foreknowledge see that's what I've been driving to you about that's what the Prophet would say he said predestination looks back to foreknowledge he said in foreknowledge looks to destiny well does not listen what I'm talking about you get it see predestination we look that away for knowledge we look that away well you know what you know what uh who would have thought it this in school anyhow understand Einstein said then if you had infinite or he say that unlimited eyesight and you looked out like that you know what you see the back of your head because everything's in a circle Einstein could see that but around said I'd like to kind of hold him and talk to him about that finite universe everybody were infinitely finite I get that all messed up you put it in the right place because you got the education I don't but listen then why do we want to go with predestination to try to find a destiny why not go to for knowledge to see then I can go all the way back around and come right back around me stand-in there cuz for knowledge would go this far that way as it goes that way see we want to foreknowledge there's something behind us God don't look behind us I'm glad of that when you went down there oh oh bailing whenever I said look here look look what they're doing look at the Honda parks look at all the things that's taking place trying to remind God of it he said I see no problem in Israel that's wonderful when he was telling him the truth he shortens of our said the hunger part so it must have been the bad things and he said I don't see that you know why because he failed to see the shout of the King that was in the camp of the children of Israel the prayer changes things you know what it changed me from a sinner to a saint it changed you from a sinner to a site well I'll just meant now that wasn't just meant to be it's what I said we want to we want the things that we can play with in their mind so we when we start talking like that yeah but God chose me God chose me okay man well if he chose me I didn't how to do it now wait a minute you got to accept it pardonez not a pardon unless received as a pardon am i right won't bring you out of jail and actually accept what the pardon says see we look at something we we wanted our way and we can only handle that one word in one thing and that's why I tried back guardar to emphasize it over and over sure God chose us but you know what I like about it there was some reason you don't think that way are you talking about how good or how bad I was and what I was this out of the other because I can quote the Prophet the more flaws are the one that are you know he picked the Moses and look what he doing he picked this one they look what he done picked Abraham he lied look what he done when I've always tried to get you to look at and you won't do it you want to get on to some kind of seed doctrine and follow a line Esau was away owner better man than Jacob was let's talk about the Bible Esau was a greater man than Jacob was God said I love Jake cooking a Hades oh there's no such thing in the word in God anymore to have a word of hate so what's he saying I disliked his ways what was the difference between Jacob and Esau anybody want to get up and take it tell me the good that Jacob done he saw was away on a better guy but our checkup was stealing everything he could get but even after doing all of that the guard would come to hand in when Jacob is coming back he sends his family cause he's like oh he gonna kill me I'll just give him everything I got maybe maybe it'll appease him or something Esau comes walking toward him and he thinks I'm gonna die and he saw just throws down everything and reaches and grabs him and hugs him said my brother Jacob says take all of this he said I got more than you got let's see we want it on some kind of a way of something we try to make it if it if it don't work with grace we try to go over on to look something we didn't do or didn't do that's why I use that over and over and over about Calvinism Calvinism believes or teaches basics of Calvinism that if there's just a certain people that are to be saved that everybody is not to be saved that's Calvinistic teaching Armenian said he gives it for everybody we know everybody ain't gonna be saved but it ain't because of God in his ways oh when I first read that and when I found him during the church age book and started reading when that prophet started talking about that African and I'm not throwing iphone races or anything you know better than that but there they were those people that never heard of Jesus Christ in any way that God is going to judge them according to how they live by their own laws you ever thought you could hear that out of a Baptist no no cause we've got away with them Baptists nine throwing off on the Baptist just telling it like it is within Baptist had always said you've got to be born again because you ain't born again you ain't going well we can stand here and talk oh not about a Jew that comes down through there has never accepted Jesus Christ but they're given eternal life one day he's that on his predestination or is it on his foreknowledge that that was his children that was his people that he put them in bondage and out of the way to bring you and I in the route their church routes is Jewish oh you don't want to hear that thought right the foundation of all of our religious belief is Jewish because they were the chosen of God that's why you don't hear me thought I'll none of these things but which do you own you want for knowledge or you want predestination there's one thing about it if it's about foreknowledge then I know one thing for sure I've been in on this thing I don't know where do you understand what I mean by that but I've lived life how about you and I sure ain't lived the life to where he could accept me so don't get that in your mind I've lived the life to the point that he didn't need to accept me because that's what I like about it all the greatest of all in all and and the purity that man was living by the laws and the thing and he said you know no no marker against me he said but I'm chiefest of sinners what about a man like that that you couldn't put a marker against his life he was in training to be a high priest or a lawyer or whatever coming down what about it high priest couldn't have a mark against him none whatsoever he died he did after the faces on the base of basis of not trying to appease God to where he would make a choice with me no work no no I don't want the choice to be made because of what I would do or what I wouldn't do I want the choice to be done because what I he's my daddy see I never had a daddy coat daddy died not four years old but you see I never had nobody to stand in that places and daddy had brothers inside but one day I found my daddy or he found me that's more like it any game their choice I was a deacon at 23 years of age anybody knows that 50 years ago you didn't make a deacon out of a 23 year old kid that's too much you forget it I understood that but there I was 23 years old an ordained deacon in a Baptist Church because I served and tried to do everything I could to serve God in the whole I didn't have to come into message and quit this and quit that it was already gone that's what I've tried to tell you the predestination does God change his mind about his word or did he set back before the world and see what he would do when he come to that king he said okay Oh King I'll give you 15 years your prior sincerity honesty didn't give it to everybody so it must have been something about the man that was good now here's what I'm gonna try to get to you could it actually be that God is looking at your desires and my desires instead of looking at his own because I can prove he's not looking at his we see we want to take that then and we want to make it to brother Dale I III know you're right you didn't drink smoke and this that and the other and all but but I did well what so what so what did you say well I'm I'm not as good as other people where does God put it on goodness that's what I've tried to prove to you God should have went with Esau cuz he saw was the greater man you tell me in the garden Cain and Abel oh that okay and he was a serpent seed oh that's it what was he God offered him salvation said would you not be accepted had you done like your brother now if he offered it to him then there's one thing about it God would be a respecter of persons if he didn't give it to him if he wanted it now that's as straight as I can make it if you wanted it start for you if you want salvation and not children it's not for you it's not something that we try to make ourselves to be some great big seed doctrine or idea if I was born with this seed enemy I'll be all right coated I'll make it where's food of the seed it was put tight before the foundation of the world according to the Bible because he was he foreknew us before the world he died before the world that you and I could be saved they were gonna get into Christ's mystery of God revealed I've asked you to read that code and want to get into it where the Prophet said God had in the back part of his mind a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve yes brother Dale ever since you've been ever since we've been around you with we always paid attention to you to you don't like these seed doctrines I don't like seeing doctrines that goes the wrong way I know there were no seed in me if it was where was that now come on pre determining or foreknowledge where was that see that where is it now it's in your soul by the baptism when the whole to go right if there's any seeded out I don't want no seed in this body no one received my spirit rim it's got to be in my soul now try to take that back before the foundation in the world or take it forward to a predetermined you see that's the point that we're doing we're trying to make things out of the Bible instead of letting it be what it is this message cover come to bring us a new Bible when I started reading this message I started reading it I read the Bible before then I started reading this message I couldn't find no difference because I could find the same God talking to me that was talking to me when I was in the Baptist Church I look forward come on he said oh boy one of these days I'm gonna be a millionaire one of these days I'm gonna be rich he'd be kind of like the guy was it what he he got the newspaper a day ahead of time and man he could just tell everything he gonna take place he could bet on never horse race he could do everything cuz he had the newspaper a day ahead of time fictitional story but it tells the truth he was really having a wonderful time until he read one day and he could turn to the obituaries a day before okay well good is it me and I being I what good is it there was a time when we were in school talking about things like that I did go to a little bit but we talked about what it would be and they said back then I forgot what it was and if I get it wrong you put it right but it was somewhere like a 10 but 10 or 12 but 12 room that if you put a million one dollar bills that fill that up because that's what everybody thought nobody could ever get a millionaire I mean we never thought about being a millionaire right because that was telling how much it would just stack it up and and it would cover a what see down million dollars told me nothing you can have a million dollars today and be broke as can be tomorrow just my pipes of the law up being her but take one thing about it you'd say well that'd be my destiny one day to be a billionaire know my destiny is to find out who I was and how I got here that's my destiny that's the thing that thrills my soul is to be able to look back and see what he done for me he wrote our name in the book of life with the foundation of the world right and he didn't predetermine it that to come through and be no but he foreknew before knew okay listen let me take another thought because these are the two things for knowledge and you won't for knowledge or you want predestination well I'd like to have the Destiny that I know what it's going to be no I'm having a wonderful time trying to find what I need I may come out home I'm enjoying my life of the fact of what God had led me I know and realized who it was I saw him when I was 11 years old you know the story I saw him standing in that church I went back by there years later and said god I hated left I because when I left there you were staring at Milton I was 11 years old something spoke said when you left I left we well I could have been the devil telling me that I'd even agree with him because when I left I was moving on I thank God for the journey that I've had for the opportunities I've had and listen to me church Ivan I'm this away ever pastor that I've ever had I went to them when I left them and told them how much I appreciated them for what they had done for me in my life and trying to help me in Christianity and I walked with some good ones but I thank God I thank them for helping me I was sitting there Sunday listening to brother minister and I said Lord it's good to hear somebody talk about what you believe you saved do you agree right now now just to get all for that what does it matter what I understood I agreed with I thought he done a good job marvelous understanding huh I'm not stamping him as the finality of he's this Morita leader he's the Prophet that was to come no I'm just telling it like it is I enjoyed it because he were talking about my daddy I love for somebody to talk about daddy because I never had one so I don't but then I found my daddy my family nothing the Baptist Church I went back to the pastor of the church that time and thanked him for helping me when I left and left churches and this message always go to the pastor thank him for helping me why because anybody's ever helped me I thank God for it because there's one thing about it I couldn't make it by myself you can't either that's what you're thinking you think I made it on my own no you didn't make it on your own you're gonna die on your own little pity party house to you one more thought what do you think about when you say not foreknowledge Webster says that means knowledge before you know for knowledge those who he foreknew he predestinated he foresaw that's why we read it learn in Jeremiah I knew they said what about telling Jeremiah that he knew him before the foundation of the world before he ever come through his mother's womb he knew him and ordained him to be a prophet one of these days I'll get to that to where we're gonna preach on predestinated gifts I've preached a little bit to you just enough to get you to think predestinated gifts Malachi 4 was a predestinated gift why because it was God's Word I don't look at brother Branham as being God or anything like that no but takes one thing about it the word that's what I look at it is not the person that comes predestinated from God it's the word our seed the word I rejoice in the word that I've been able to hear what do you think about for knowledge you ever think about for knowledge is just a simple little word called the mind I mean God had foreknowledge right so that's you know what that meant that meant in his mind he thought this thing out you go with me in his mind he thought it huh so what is foreknowledge the mind of God and like I said very minute ago I don't want to be just a thought in God's mind because sinners are thoughts in cars man no I want to be a part of God's mind I want his mind as far as the scripture said if this mind be in you the mind therein we gave the scripture it's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and there he was that mind but that's exactly talking about me and you he has given us his mind the new birth is the mind of God imparted unto man known as that's in my soul oh brother well what is your soul is what are you come on are you a Mormon that believes in pre existence of souls no do we believe in reincarnation of soul you know going from one to another no see if the mind that was in Christ being you it'll do what and make a new creature right a new creation right to have his mind to come into your mind not his brain not his brain the new birth is not in your brain that's what I was asking the brother when I said where's it at where's to see that is it in your brain is it in your body is any feet is it in your hand is it words of that he's ain't talking to you answered what are you doing how London say anyway well because he couldn't do it what can you say but we spend our time putting it some seed doctrine and we just rejoice over Oh can't you just see that we was back to her we was actually back now let me say it the way I mean it the only way that I can know I was back to her is by what I'm doing right now what you are right now is the only thing that can be talked about of being back there because I'm talking about the soul not no bodies back there not no spirits back there that's the profit where we spirits in he said no we was in the what we was in the mind of God what is the mind of God the foreknowledge of God that he was back there before anything then and then we went little bitty identities they draw it out and make it look beautiful and make you a heart or something and put little dots in it and people hoager look at that I'm worried little dots I ain't no little dot I'm a person and I put my salvation in Jesus Christ and he's made me his he's become my father by a new birth so now I know my father I have my true father I can rejoice and say thank you daddy you don't never talk to him like that I heard Billy polish at one time he said he went to pick up brother Branham so you walk down to the motel redwood and said you heard him sitting in our saying Papa Papa you know what if you're born again that's not you have a Papa you have a Papa because he's your Papa he's he is what we have need of that's not degrading your mom and daddy no because if have this name new birth in their heart they have the same father they have the same mother who is our mother the Lord Jesus Christ do you think about it where we spiritually know we was in the mind of God now watch where we spirits then know theirs in the mind of God there's your foreknowledge the pre determining would be trying to put you that away uh-huh let's don't go that away oh it's wonderful one day when we get there it'll be so great we can walk on the streets of gold and we can do all of these things and have a great time and rejoicing over I'm having a good time now if you ain't I'd like to talk to you about my daddy for a while I'd like to tell you how daddy can tell you what daddy can tell you like he told me one day I was well I was dead loud I would just cried and it's down and out I got in the car and started down the road and met Terrence or Wade won and they said wait Gordon Eddie I said I'm going for a ride I'll be back in a minute I drove down nearly the maysville crying about how bad it was and about that time a little voice said who do you think you are and what do you think this is compared to what I went through I came back up the road crying my heart out of joy that he would be willing to associate with me I can stand here and tell you you know that's true I've done it I can tell you things where God met with me with that don't make nothing out of me that makes something out of my daddy what is foreknowledge forget it it is the mind of God and it's broke down so far until it comes into your mind not your brain to bind into the mind of your being which is your soul and gives eternal life to that soul and gives you then the very life of Almighty God there's my daddy living now and me and Paul said tonight that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God he said it's not I that liveth you see he said in the mind for our changes things I'm not asking God to change his mind God's secret mystery he had before the world will begun now back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was going to to do back in the back part of his mind you say well that ain't even sensible it's identically any nurses oh come to respect you okay you got your brain and I'm not a doctor but the front part of your brain is your intelligence your thinking ability then you keep going back in to subconsciousness and things then you get back to a real mind that mind that's there is what's controlling you and that is the new birth you got many stages of the human mind so when the prophet would say in the back part of God's mind you know what we don't have to get into the back part of his mind to find out what we're talking about in the back part of his mind is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he goes back to for knowledge but brother Dale do you want to go Thatta way or that way if I had the choice I'd like to go Thatta way back into God's mind but just remember one thing predestination one more thought be careful how you predetermined things because you could predetermine yourself out of existence now by foreknowledge I can make this statement by predestination I dare not make it that what that God before the world had a plan and a purpose to make himself manifest not to pick a certain group of people but they'd be a group of people that would fulfill what He desires and it would be able to walk in his mind I preached a sermon here one day and on the Coppola years ago I preached on a word called Coppola and I brought it out and Coppola is a spherical dome and things like that setting on a weathervane sitting on the church etc etc well to show you how his mind works and you know I went home and I I speaking pretty good and I was sitting there cousin preach that night six o'clock and I said Lord that was a pretty good talk the way he was helping me to bring it out this morning I really enjoyed it and the spherical dome and I said you know we could be resurrected and sitting in heavenly places they that's kind of dome it's not not our Churchill I'm talking about the new Berkut Resurrection sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that was wonderful thoughts your prophet brought and then you brought it to me and I brought it to the people it's about that time he said but that ain't what I'm talking about and I said hold on just a minute now something was talking and I knew better to argue what was talking but I knew I didn't understand what we're talking what being saying unless said Lord what do you mean he said that ain't what I was talking about I knew the brother that translated that worked for the voice of God recording we had 12 years of college I knew I couldn't argue intellectually with him I said well what do you mean Lord that all of that was good but he said no it's not what I'm talking about that's it okay I got to tell you I played it and every time he would come across you know everybody called it Coppola Coppola you know I listened and when he came down to it and that makes it he says he didn't say Coppola he said copula turning some cog wheels he never said Coppola he said copula I said well that's what can that fit with well it fits with the fact that he was talking about the head and body joining together because that was what he's talking about go check it into questions and answers and found that word Coppola if you can't I'll find it for you he was talking about head and body uniting to bring the message in the life stage so he wasn't saying Coppola like capping off so I got back and listened again I said okay now I'm getting some thoughts copula I said okay if he's head and body uniting together then but one word that I can do collation hidden body or not he was not talking about something up here to coming down he was talking about hidden body go get the message and read it head and body coming together copulation which is the same as husband and wife because that was what he was doing he's teaching us the Word of God and we're becoming one with that we were in the point of copulation the understanding of God's Word that is making us to be his children his offspring husband and wife head and body you not I come back crying priest another message enjoyed it well what do you think we all we need to do is one time listen to the word that's being brought to us and see if it's uniting us together with a headstone or see if it's driving us away you might see what's taking place you might see the bride in Christ becoming one and what did the Prophet say when the bride realized who she is and what she's your father he said she'll be an invincible army come on musicians what he is for knowledge the mind of God so in the mind of God we'll start from there and start bringing a world into existence bringing life into existence bringing man into existence and see his plan and his purpose think on these things let's stand together I hope you follow my point why do we want to go that away let's go back in his mind let's go back into his mind and see if we can come out of there with something better than to have a billionaire or a Destin he said then we can see that God does change his mind not change his mind not he was going to do this but he changes it and does this he knew before the world he was gonna do that I hope you follow that he knew before the world ever begun that he was gonna give that man 15 years so he didn't change his mind about his word he told him he's gonna die he gave him 15 years he died he didn't change his mind He fulfilled his fine what do we got amen that's coming economy it may be evening
