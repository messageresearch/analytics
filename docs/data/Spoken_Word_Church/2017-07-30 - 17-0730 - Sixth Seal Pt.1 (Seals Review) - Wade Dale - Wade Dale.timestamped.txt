[2:41] would just break one because they're
[2:43] going to be traveling around and doing I
[2:46] need peace minute I don't have my braces
[2:51] they become damaged depending with it we
[2:54] need to know slower good water holiday
[2:59] where your rights are right upstairs
[3:03] when I used it up there all right so
[3:05] let's cover just to just to background a
[3:09] little bit because let's start with six
[3:11] seals fifth seal remember we're going to
[3:15] read it right here
[3:17] big deal and we had opened the fifth
[3:20] seal I saw under the altar the souls of
[3:22] them that were slain for the word of God
[3:24] and for the testimony which they held
[3:26] right and they cried with a loud voice
[3:29] saying how long O Lord holy and true
[3:31] dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[3:33] on them that dwell on the earth and
[3:35] white robes were given unto every one of
[3:38] them
[3:38] we'll send the demo that you dressed for
[3:40] a little season until their
[3:41] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[3:43] which that means it's the same people
[3:46] okay that should be killed as they were
[3:49] should be fulfilled now we saw that that
[3:54] fit seal we know one thing's for sure
[3:56] there was no combat beast that said come
[4:00] and see come look all the other seals
[4:01] one two three and four and when you open
[4:04] the fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[4:06] fourth beast say come and see
[4:08] I heard the voice of the third beast say
[4:10] come and see I heard the voice of the
[4:12] second beep now we know those combat
[4:14] beasts or what - man Eagle so this
[4:17] fourth one is the Eagle that fourth
[4:20] beast would be Eagle come see and healed
[4:23] them the fourth seal or so jointed write
[4:28] it down I don't want to say open it but
[4:29] he he give it to John Choi debriding
[4:31] alright then we look right here and we
[4:35] see him when he open when he who he's a
[4:37] lamb we know we know cracked his jaw one
[4:40] he can open a seat okay he's the only
[4:42] one who can open the ceiling right and
[4:43] when he had opened the fifth seal I saw
[4:45] under the old offer he immediately sees
[4:48] something he doesn't have to go through
[4:50] a combat B so we know one thing's for
[4:52] sure there was no combat beef so the
[4:54] prophet of God tells us that on the
[4:56] fourth seal that the rapture takes place
[4:59] okay that's to take place on the fourth
[5:02] seal because what is the four combat
[5:04] beta the holy oh right the believer the
[5:09] Holy Ghost in the believer is the louts
[5:11] man an eagle so it so the property guy
[5:13] goes one thing for sure there's no
[5:15] combat base so the bribe was the Holy
[5:19] Ghost must be gone somewhere cuz there's
[5:24] no combat beast to say John coming three
[5:25] because immediately John looks and like
[5:28] I said he looks into another dimension
[5:30] okay he walked he steps into another
[5:34] dimension in he sees I saw it wasn't
[5:37] that the for combat beasts led him
[5:39] anywhere he saw in other words his
[5:41] revelation had come
[5:42] waste now I'm not saying he didn't need
[5:45] to come back big but he to me John
[5:49] having the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[5:50] has those combat bees inside of him
[5:53] dr. maestra eagle but he did have the
[5:57] eagle in northern because he was a
[5:58] prophet and he was looking at things
[6:00] that man's done well that was written
[6:03] 2,000 years ago the man still talking
[6:05] about it now but when he opened the
[6:07] fifth seal I saw under the altar another
[6:10] dimension the souls of them that were
[6:13] slain for the word of God so there
[6:15] somewhere not in this dimension so he
[6:18] had this he had to by revelation go into
[6:21] another dimension right so now we show
[6:23] to that just for just for background
[6:26] just vowels been a little bit and
[6:29] several one but look when we went
[6:33] through these seals so this is the way I
[6:35] see the seals the seals were given for
[6:37] the redemption of the body the seventh
[6:40] seal is not for redemption of the salt
[6:42] Jesus Christ died at Calvary for the
[6:45] redemption of yourself the purchase for
[6:47] that Nikko he purchased you a gallery
[6:51] right
[6:52] he probably purchased the whole thing
[6:54] expected okay but it hasn't been applied
[6:56] but one of the seals break God's getting
[6:59] ready to apply it to a group of people
[7:01] is that all right okay all right don't
[7:03] want to get the fridge in here - let me
[7:04] get back still sent oh come on
[7:06] no not not here not here a ban we got up
[7:12] there to go bro
[7:13] all right so we saw the first seal the
[7:17] first seal was the Alliance anointing
[7:19] they're not lying
[7:20] Ryan li oen lyin okay we see the
[7:25] revelation one true and living God
[7:27] because we see the first deal with a
[7:29] white horse rider riding out away from
[7:31] something and he was false but he had to
[7:34] be riding away from something that's
[7:36] true okay
[7:38] and many people teach the sealed is just
[7:41] the revelation of the Antichrist sure it
[7:44] makes him known but I thought it was the
[7:47] revelation of Jesus coming okay because
[7:49] Jesus Christ is going to change our body
[7:51] number that
[7:52] that is totally contrary to what he
[7:54] wants to do okay that's why the seals
[7:59] have to be a revelation it's not just
[8:03] reading not just the ability to read
[8:06] like the properties are pity to that
[8:07] your ability to read right okay but we
[8:10] want to see the revelation the hidden
[8:12] part the mystery so we see truly that
[8:17] the white horse shows now we're going to
[8:20] talk about this for just second because
[8:22] we'll go over it again there is three
[8:26] stages of the new birth right judge
[8:29] occasion sanctification about digital
[8:30] Holy Ghost gives you the new birth right
[8:32] I believe that I don't believe you just
[8:34] was born here with it I believe you had
[8:36] to go through these three stages yeah go
[8:39] run around and get your home which is
[8:44] the wonderful three to future home he
[8:47] says the herb goes through the same
[8:49] thing and he said thank God I taught
[8:51] this when I was young and I'm still
[8:53] teaching it now is these three stages of
[8:55] grace yeah okay which is justification
[8:58] sanctification the baptismal holy go
[9:00] right so how does it ties into the
[9:03] sealed well justification when that
[9:05] white horse rider rode away from
[9:07] whatever that was he rode away from that
[9:11] whoever that is
[9:13] see you got sin - it's great he's all I
[9:17] have a good prophet that's good it's got
[9:20] to have to meet that wild horse rider
[9:23] which is the falseness appearing real
[9:27] appearing right has got right away what
[9:29] was that is that that in other words
[9:31] what is happening Satan has listen he's
[9:34] here now he's all around you but if
[9:38] you're born again he's not in you he
[9:41] can't catch your soul but he can touch
[9:42] your body in your spirit ring right okay
[9:45] through memory reason conscience faith
[9:47] imaginations that's our problem we have
[9:49] too much memory reading conservation and
[9:52] that's what bothers us right okay
[9:54] I sold of the bother me if I'm going
[9:56] all right it is sealed off train can't
[9:59] get in
[10:00] that's right Gogol back out dynamo back
[10:03] out right it will go free to begin stop
[10:11] already
[10:12] well when you see the great when you see
[10:15] the seals oh when you see them in this
[10:17] way kind of reader tell me one time when
[10:19] I did this someone for them he's right
[10:22] never mind I've heard okay freak on
[10:23] seals being you know a type of your
[10:27] Christian journey I said well what in
[10:29] the hell everyday is you think it was
[10:31] you know me did you think brother and
[10:35] preach the greatest message of his whole
[10:37] life in Greek seven seals and it was to
[10:39] reveal the devil please people call
[10:43] degrees then this message a long time we
[10:46] got to get we got to get down to the to
[10:49] do it's like a total brotherhood
[10:51] yesterday we get to the essence of the
[10:53] message right you heard me say that one
[10:55] hundred thousand job if the end this
[10:58] right here
[10:58] Paul said okay to you the letter right
[11:01] if I have if I had a good one on him
[11:06] I'll kill you and that a rafter nobody
[11:09] right that'll say nobody but the
[11:13] revelation contained in this will
[11:17] Raptors and gets out here so we're
[11:18] looking at your revelation so now I'm
[11:22] promise you one thing all these people
[11:23] saying I'm wrong here and there you try
[11:26] taking it back to the Bible he was a
[11:27] byproduct and if you can't put it in the
[11:30] Bible yourself if you have to say
[11:32] brother Reynolds is all the time you're
[11:34] in trouble yeah go say you can say the
[11:36] same identical and that's what he's
[11:38] doing with all these doctors will rather
[11:40] Brown said well brother Rumson yeah okay
[11:43] well what did Jesus said eat my flesh
[11:44] and drink my blood and then he left
[11:46] yeah and it's an Apollo about ten years
[11:49] before he wrote grampians and explained
[11:51] was using prophet they bowled over that
[11:53] for ten years because somebody had a
[11:56] revelation today he's talking about the
[11:58] communion
[11:59] and then eat my flesh drink my bloody
[12:01] walked away come on now he walks you
[12:03] somebody walked up read that you know
[12:05] the Messiah tell you that you'd be worn
[12:08] at your numbers I promise you but the
[12:11] revelation has come though the seals
[12:14] have opened so that we can be into these
[12:16] things and eNOS the seals are for the
[12:19] redemption of the body because
[12:20] everything else is ready yes your soul
[12:23] if you're both now that's a big word
[12:26] little word the thing where if you're
[12:27] born again your soul is just any kernel
[12:30] is gone you got the new birth you've got
[12:32] the word working in your life you're
[12:34] heading toward a body change right but
[12:38] your body and just have to be James
[12:41] we literal I've been remaindered that
[12:43] would be somebody like I told that
[12:45] brother yesterday I said the
[12:47] resurrection message was not spoken by
[12:50] dead people dead people can't speak
[12:53] resurrection it has to be alive somebody
[12:57] not one person but a live body right to
[13:01] declare the resurrection He is risen was
[13:03] not told by their people right it will
[13:06] cold somebody alive
[13:08] all right so it was a lot of word that
[13:09] went somewhere so we got down with a
[13:11] live word to what
[13:13] bring the sixth dimension here bring all
[13:16] the dead Saints here and it's in Christ
[13:19] like I said yesterday you should see it
[13:22] watch these little analogies because we
[13:24] know that Boaz type Christ right yeah
[13:28] Ruth with a mole like she talked to us
[13:32] and then the only her mama was an older
[13:35] lady she topped Israel right old Israel
[13:38] Solo has dandruff sure he did the right
[13:41] of redemption he what'd he do he
[13:43] purchased Naomi's land right right he
[13:48] got Ruth the Gentile bride but now
[13:52] that's not the end of the story they
[13:54] produce a child that's right and they
[13:56] handed that child right back to Naomi
[13:59] the old is rule Act what we gotta do
[14:01] we don't just birth Christ we gotta give
[14:04] him back to the Jews without
[14:06] giving back to old Israel so that what
[14:09] so the debt can be fulfilled right the
[14:12] 1260 days of preaching of a part of the
[14:15] day in 70 weeks all right according to
[14:18] the Bible 1250 days of preaching to
[14:20] bring the hundred forty-four thousand
[14:23] and give them the new birth mhm but also
[14:26] it's going to help get these people out
[14:28] what roads were given to the Fitz's you
[14:31] right so now let's get back to what we
[14:33] were talking about this per second then
[14:34] we'll we might not get anywhere but we
[14:36] background I'm never going to be able
[14:37] fresh by next Sunday police turn on the
[14:40] sick seal so now the first seal what is
[14:43] justification chopping off your past
[14:45] sins in other words what happened when
[14:47] that white horse rider rode away he rode
[14:50] away that was your sin that's right
[14:52] riding away okay now now remember though
[14:58] this gasification baby form we call it
[15:01] beta form justification jumped off your
[15:03] past sins but once you did you continue
[15:07] to do right give me this one that thing
[15:09] from Sonny says the things I used to do
[15:11] I do them no more that is correct
[15:13] that's a new birth because you get
[15:16] justified yeah those things are gone and
[15:20] in the stem does forgetfulness buddy
[15:22] you're going to keep sinning because one
[15:24] it made your sin is still here that's
[15:25] right yeah so the things I used to do I
[15:28] feel good that's a in digest McCadden
[15:31] all right but not born again okay so
[15:35] here the justification the white horse
[15:37] wash off your walk white lighten up your
[15:40] bass in red three ready to fly right so
[15:44] the wild horse
[15:44] now we come and see the opening of the
[15:47] second seal which was the Ox
[15:49] flavoring and what was off opps with a
[15:54] sacrifice and what did he do when they
[15:56] sacrifice that it was a blood sacrifice
[16:00] so what a sanctification always
[16:03] represent is the blood cleansing all
[16:06] right sanctification their clean spirit
[16:08] goes out of a man and book
[16:09] there you know while to dry places and
[16:12] please rest - none comes back into the
[16:14] vessel because look even at
[16:16] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[16:17] out okay you're heading towards
[16:22] something but guess what if you don't
[16:24] fill it with the Holy Ghost guessing it
[16:26] don't come back I won't make it real big
[16:31] legal breakdown of seven of his buddies
[16:34] with it right
[16:35] and if I was is the state of the man is
[16:37] worse than when he got started that's
[16:41] why I tell you sanctification is one of
[16:42] them worse places to stay Jose I'll tell
[16:46] you you got it your friends will tell
[16:48] you you got it how many people have even
[16:51] in the message so why don't you know
[16:52] you're boarding in LA quit drinking
[16:54] smoking and I started going to church
[16:56] dang I knew what the hole was that fun
[16:58] of that dismal ocean not one thing same
[17:01] though their woman he goes dirt when you
[17:04] don't yeah that one ended here when
[17:11] you're not here easier when you're late
[17:13] oh that's for me so he says he can he
[17:23] can mimic all those things but he cannot
[17:28] be filled with the holy because remember
[17:30] Judas was in this condition but now
[17:33] let's go back to the truth though cause
[17:35] when you're truly sanctified the word
[17:37] cleans you out that's the rate members
[17:40] of the first seal that's why red right
[17:45] black and gristle are our mingle table
[17:49] right okay now so you've got your white
[17:53] writers listen if you're justified and
[17:57] you got dropped off you pass them and
[17:58] you pass away for requests from there
[18:00] you're made like you're given eternal
[18:03] life you're not to ride to be given
[18:05] eternal life okay
[18:06] but now listen nobody in this room will
[18:10] fall under that so you've lost that part
[18:12] of privilege
[18:13] sorry you know too much you go do Mario
[18:18] during your journey - just say why just
[18:20] got my sins dropped off and if I die
[18:22] tomorrow okay no now you know too much
[18:25] but we move on to the next seal break it
[18:29] which is the second seal which is what I
[18:31] said read the Red Horse symbolize what
[18:34] red is always strength defying cleansing
[18:36] the odds remember that what the red
[18:39] heifer right the red and brings it down
[18:43] with us just the part number the red
[18:45] half rule is do the red heifer could
[18:48] only have three hairs in a horrible body
[18:49] beep like very different color that's
[18:52] why they're trying to replicate that off
[18:54] now or the red heifer off center day
[18:56] they're trying to replicate the red
[18:58] heifer right and because Israel know
[19:02] that I have it for sacrifice code it was
[19:04] the waters of separation it was a
[19:06] sanctifying factor but God says the Holy
[19:09] Ghost
[19:10] burns all that out with what
[19:12] sanctification husband spirit goes out
[19:15] right that was that red horse rider
[19:19] riding away you say the word you ride
[19:22] ride away from you this elder to you
[19:25] that's right he's riding away from you
[19:28] because it says right here look well and
[19:35] what was did to know something could
[19:36] come see you over the white horse and he
[19:38] to sell another boat he went forward he
[19:42] went forward do you laugh wherever he
[19:44] was residing he left we're going to use
[19:50] this alright yes all right the second
[19:53] one was red I'm trying to cover a bunch
[19:55] of stuff at one time but just something
[19:57] that's food for thought for next time
[19:58] because we got to raise up a little bit
[20:00] higher because remember this
[20:03] justification and this justification we
[20:05] are explained it's two different it's
[20:07] the same but it has two different places
[20:09] in your vineyard
[20:10] and your journey right using thanks
[20:14] vacations the opposite now we'll go to
[20:16] the currency third beat with what man
[20:20] intelligence all right the intelligence
[20:23] of man now here comes an uber then you
[20:26] say well what's that got to do with
[20:27] black because it was white red and black
[20:32] horse black horse well if you have the
[20:38] new birth today you're a dead person
[20:40] that's right
[20:42] you're dead if any part oh you alive
[20:45] then the things I used to do I still do
[20:48] but the things I used to do I do them no
[20:51] more coat the Deuter is not in there and
[20:55] this goes on refrigerator by the way
[20:56] round one to explain that distilled over
[20:58] pre-draft it's the only thing it just
[20:59] sticks on refrigerator door pickled up
[21:01] now thank you very appreciate that I'm
[21:07] sure Gabby has a lot to do with that she
[21:10] smiles its own though thank you sister
[21:11] Gabby for giving it to Ryan three years
[21:14] of me okay I think he's got several over
[21:17] to give to other people in anyway the
[21:19] third seal was the third base which was
[21:23] the man annoying
[21:24] remember that come under Lutheran Wesley
[21:26] the intelligence the literal
[21:29] intelligence which put books together
[21:31] and we had a great time after the after
[21:36] the Dark Ages coming out of the Dark
[21:39] Ages into the intelligence of man but
[21:42] you have a dead nature you have to be
[21:43] dated right now your shows not black you
[21:47] can't top up but you guys the old you
[21:49] must be black black and out dead gone
[21:53] and then and then what this comes the
[21:57] new man the new birth the things I used
[21:59] to do I do them no more that new person
[22:03] comes in the person of the Holy Ghost
[22:04] comes in and what kills your own nature
[22:08] right fur seal so we're killing the old
[22:10] nature and now you're born again you're
[22:13] just as eternal as God is in your soul
[22:17] but she doesn't stop that he's all
[22:21] brother what about the fourth seal with
[22:22] a fourth seal here's why
[22:28] pale horse now why is the pale horse and
[22:31] I told you I took paint you take white
[22:34] paint red paint and black paint and mix
[22:37] it together you get a period chunky ugly
[22:42] pale color but if you take the
[22:46] justification of sanctification and the
[22:48] baptism of a whole adult in you ply the
[22:50] word to it you get that mixture and it
[22:54] may look pale to the world and it may
[22:56] look bad to them but not to me and you
[22:59] the glorious time because we come now to
[23:02] remember the fourth seal the rapture
[23:04] takes place
[23:04] there's a body change take place in that
[23:06] for seven why because the word has been
[23:09] bought may live that pale horse rider is
[23:13] death and he'll you know boy you can't
[23:15] take a body change with death and he'll
[23:16] residing here death and he'll got to
[23:19] leave all right man now becomes as a
[23:23] fifth seal which we were just on there's
[23:25] no combat be so the rapture takes place
[23:27] in the fourth seal it's in another
[23:30] dimension at that point in time white
[23:37] robes were given they were all Jewish
[23:41] because it was their brethren all right
[23:43] because brother Graham cities did all
[23:46] the sawing the officer the soldiers in
[23:48] were slammed with work on for the
[23:50] testimony was to help he said they
[23:51] didn't have the testimony of Jesus
[23:52] Christ because they didn't believe you
[23:54] to drive with my father but God give
[23:57] that why this seal for me is the
[24:00] greatest showing of grace he give the
[24:03] new birth to a group of people they
[24:04] didn't even know who he was
[24:06] but because of what happened because
[24:10] Boaz looking at Naomi he didn't want her
[24:15] he had to redeem her to get Ruth
[24:21] that's we blinded the eyes of the do to
[24:26] get his Gentile bride but he didn't
[24:28] forget that Naomi you didn't forget that
[24:30] purchase in other words the referee gave
[24:33] it right back to her but he gave her a
[24:34] job then she couldn't have these these
[24:40] are here just haven't you birth while
[24:43] roads were given after they did I mean
[24:46] because if you don't get the new birds
[24:48] and you burp it's a new birth of a new
[24:50] person inside of a live person it's not
[24:54] in it you can't get the new birth after
[24:55] you did you stuff em unless you have to
[24:58] be given eternal life right in our
[25:01] purchase on this side it's the purchased
[25:04] possession that we have on this side but
[25:07] if we die without the new part we've got
[25:09] to we've only got one hope and that
[25:13] ain't very much I guarantee you I know
[25:16] what it is though the Bible tells you
[25:18] says you will be judged by your words I
[25:20] don't ever want to be goodbye my work
[25:23] you read it revelations when the books
[25:26] are open those people are judged by
[25:28] their work don't ever let me be doing my
[25:32] work they're filthy rags I felt this one
[25:35] homicidal happen alright so this is the
[25:37] great seal because he's giving eternal
[25:39] life to a group of people that don't
[25:41] even want it amen it's the first
[25:47] revelation for the body change to this
[25:48] justification times two because remember
[25:51] if he looks and sees these people in the
[25:57] form that they're in on the earth he
[26:00] can't kill he's got a killer that's
[26:02] right
[26:03] but he literally listened he literally
[26:06] has to look through the blood and see
[26:08] this group of people and it got me some
[26:10] white somewhere there's got to be some
[26:14] sort of justification that he gives
[26:17] these people right sees as the
[26:25] justification because the real them
[26:26] whatever did it hey Naomi was a Jew okay
[26:33] she didn't deny that she was Jewish
[26:36] she had an inheritance right but she
[26:39] lost it
[26:41] I'm in the Bible she lost the
[26:43] inheritance right did you block their
[26:45] inheritance because God told them in the
[26:48] old days would your met a lot I'm
[26:50] married to you Israel but I'm going to
[26:51] divorce you because you went whoring in
[26:54] the world all the things of the world I
[26:56] won't divorce you but I'm not going
[26:57] forget you that's right he divorced her
[27:00] to take the Gentile bride beautiful time
[27:04] beautiful time but this is justification
[27:06] time to brother Ron said I'm leaving
[27:08] soon maybe I think I want sex I don't
[27:13] want to be wrong but he says there's a
[27:15] higher form of justification there's a
[27:17] higher form of sanctification because
[27:20] it's justification only chopped off your
[27:21] past things I did but this justification
[27:24] right here the real you didn't do that
[27:28] if you didn't do it at all sit as if
[27:30] they never feel Jesus Christ because if
[27:32] he had to look down not through the
[27:34] blood and see these people he has to
[27:37] kill they put him on the cross but
[27:41] looking through the blood he sees that
[27:44] the in other words this is why I say if
[27:48] God has not blinded rhymes will never
[27:50] come in and God did not blinded her eyes
[27:52] that are never putting a little cross
[27:53] and they would have took a rafter and
[27:54] they went to bed no Daniel seventy weeks
[27:56] whether it was a tent out in the middle
[27:58] it would have been able to took their
[28:00] rapture they would have had their 50th
[28:02] Jubilee and they were the start
[28:03] in the Millennium not just way out there
[28:05] okay I know that's way that we see it
[28:08] here so but he had to break it so that
[28:11] we could come in
[28:12] you know the 1970 weeks you see those
[28:14] two brackets you know you see the turk
[28:16] ages well if you slide them together
[28:17] that's all the Israel we were injected
[28:20] because Ruth was married in a mall that
[28:24] woman was married into she was she had
[28:26] no inheritance genuine herebut but she
[28:31] was part of Naomi's family by marriage
[28:35] and that's who both had was hired he
[28:39] wanted Rose didn't want Naomi but he
[28:41] knew had to redeem though now let me
[28:43] give her okay I just to me it's a
[28:46] wonderful thing it's a fifth seal it's a
[28:51] special group of people because this is
[28:53] all Jewish will file a new birth we're
[28:55] all Jewish men we're all Jews by birth a
[28:57] new birth that's right okay and so what
[29:00] the grace that they did that's what we
[29:01] get so the fifth seal is to me is a feel
[29:04] of grace that that there's unmerited
[29:07] favor there's nothing these people did
[29:09] they're earning her life now listen
[29:11] there's nothing you did either you're
[29:14] just like this fifty of you you put him
[29:16] on the cross a man but being a Gentile
[29:20] we accept the cross and him being the
[29:22] Messiah they have it right that's the
[29:26] difference but it's still taught the
[29:28] same way you and I you know Christ along
[29:30] your crime you did not grow up in your
[29:33] life going for welcome Jesus in my life
[29:35] no they think I did it they taught the
[29:38] things I did right all right I did over
[29:41] and over without Apple in the world
[29:43] I liked it right yeah you know why cause
[29:46] it giver wasn't there to turn me around
[29:50] but one day he spoke and I asked you
[29:53] and the things I used to do I'm doing
[29:56] tomorrow paper so see the seals is not
[30:00] just showing for horse riders and v
[30:06] build you know there's a there's an
[30:08] underlying meaning that we're not
[30:10] getting because it's been 60 years since
[30:12] he preached all right greatest man did
[30:17] you say - yellow priest and nobody can
[30:18] understand really what he said yeah
[30:20] some say it's close I'm sad to open I
[30:22] think that there's a tree if you say
[30:25] it's closed it's closed yeah keep that
[30:28] open it can be open to the Confessor
[30:30] because when you closed your mind off
[30:31] you can load the book I thought
[30:34] revelation 10 came with a bull go use
[30:37] the one it closed it back right all
[30:40] right God brought it over the opened the
[30:42] book all right for us to come in so
[30:44] here's the here's the lion ox man Eagle
[30:47] just gave the same case best in the
[30:49] whole goat and the word remember program
[30:51] and money and restorations of bribery he
[30:55] said four or four and I'm sorry for that
[30:59] for bug stage for bug stage well is it
[31:04] homework I can't ever give homework a
[31:06] word or caterpillar luggage okay for
[31:10] messengers eat it down well it's got to
[31:13] take for life messengers to bring it
[31:15] back up now we know in your birth is on
[31:17] this three-step process but you have to
[31:20] put that in there because if you're born
[31:21] again you will go straight through the
[31:23] word that's right that's right the word
[31:24] will be more important to you than ever
[31:27] go away some kid could catch them that
[31:32] is correct that to me that is to get
[31:34] that that caps it off for you
[31:36] in your soul is that the word continues
[31:39] to be made alive sure we have a route
[31:43] some men yeah I love what some might say
[31:46] the other day said it takes two valleys
[31:47] you make one level so you guys don't
[31:50] think twice as many valleys it's too
[31:51] late 1002 to make one big mountain so
[32:02] you're gonna have to wife is being
[32:03] problem but there is the mountain back
[32:07] okay that's the mountain why the proper
[32:09] Harrington oh that's great it probably
[32:12] had to come number one because it's in
[32:15] the Bible
[32:16] number two the brother brother came
[32:18] because nobody ever I mean they just
[32:20] kind of went over the seals and class
[32:23] barking probably got clothes and this
[32:24] was not close but there was no perfect
[32:27] message until he came to bring a perfect
[32:29] message okay and he didn't bring it
[32:32] that's Bowl ad himself came amen to
[32:37] getting this right and I'm not saying
[32:39] we're different from the other bride but
[32:41] we are different from different from the
[32:42] prize because they're all and upgrade
[32:43] they don't have that word to get them
[32:46] out of the grade yet but we have enough
[32:47] work to get them out the grade hey come
[32:53] on come so sealed one three four one two
[32:59] three and four and then we have a
[33:02] rapture right you said well what's five
[33:05] six and seven
[33:07] oh well if we go to four CS and all this
[33:12] must be just used it is in its natural
[33:15] form you hear me
[33:18] naturally this is going to happen this
[33:21] is not a fancy land or something that
[33:24] might happen no it's going to happen
[33:26] there is that gives you somewhere in
[33:28] another dimension there's going to be
[33:29] giving eternal life and they gotta wait
[33:33] until their brethren is killed which is
[33:36] during this 1260 days then they're all
[33:39] going to come back into the Millennium I
[33:41] see that more now than ever that bit
[33:42] field you there cuz cuz the millennium
[33:44] is to the Jews and not to me in you
[33:47] somebody's asking somebody that sends a
[33:49] week so named Bob we're talking about
[33:53] you after look Dan same weeks to the
[33:56] Jews
[33:58] it doesn't matter if we have a green
[34:00] idea we're suffering we got time when I
[34:02] went on time anyway brother I understand
[34:06] there's a there's a marriage supper
[34:07] going on during this time right
[34:09] like I mean at the past eight weeks in
[34:12] the Bible says that there's one week
[34:15] left after the rapture I don't care what
[34:17] anybody says pretty our prophet he can't
[34:21] say any name Pastor Bible teacher make a
[34:25] covenant with many for what one week and
[34:28] brother Brown said that can't be Christ
[34:29] with those Christ's don't break
[34:31] covenants and he said we're here he said
[34:33] we've missed the record right if we're
[34:36] here when I coming up with the Jews it's
[34:37] made with endicott we've missed it so
[34:40] the rapture takes place in their blood
[34:42] well seven years one week
[34:46] go back to I will read it the other day
[34:49] Rachel and Jacob Jacob has a work seven
[34:56] years to get Rachel and he says he
[35:00] fulfil her week that's true listen
[35:04] brother grounders didn't get this he did
[35:05] pull this out of the air people okay it
[35:07] was in the Bible before he got here he
[35:10] just took a prophet just did what dig it
[35:12] out and make it known to the people
[35:14] that's what brother rounded he never he
[35:16] never had a hidden mystery in here
[35:18] remember they told him I said you with
[35:19] your revelation you can write a 23rd
[35:21] chapter revelation pieces that shout is
[35:23] it he said can't add one word can't take
[35:27] one word out all right so I and like I
[35:30] said forth I mean one song that you've
[35:32] got explained by level it is a Jewish
[35:35] time to millennium is to the Jew you and
[35:38] I are already eternal were eternal over
[35:40] here this one we're in new eternity with
[35:44] time it's no longer does but remember
[35:46] and Daniel it says what he said to my
[35:50] angel put one foot on land one foot on
[35:52] sea
[35:52] raised his hand to heaven and said for a
[35:54] time times and a dividing of time three
[35:59] and a half years to watch to finish the
[36:01] medicine Jesus Christ not to finish
[36:04] that's correct that's why if you don't
[36:06] get the sad damage in the week right you
[36:07] cannot place them in these seals okay
[36:10] not and people go bonkers anyway that
[36:13] your aspartate placed on the fourth day
[36:14] I bought five six and seven four five
[36:16] six and seven will lapse back over here
[36:18] already home care for the redemption of
[36:20] our body this is your soul Redemption
[36:23] this is your body redemption because
[36:26] it's going to take what grace it's going
[36:29] to take us realizing that they're real
[36:31] you didn't do it you have no more
[36:34] against you good morning in the mark you
[36:37] have now is what Satan is going through
[36:39] your brain with your memory reads
[36:41] incontinence
[36:41] I've spit all over myself all right did
[36:44] I have my header on use on how you here
[36:46] yesterday well this is good it ain't
[36:48] good that all right we like to have
[36:53] still have a little fun but we get into
[36:56] the sixth seal now we're heading toward
[36:58] something else we're heading towards
[37:00] sanctification times two and I say
[37:03] Thomas - yes just tell them higher form
[37:06] of single issue because the metropolises
[37:09] I died a there's a daily sanctification
[37:12] when there was still us as member of
[37:15] adèle some of the angular does this
[37:17] chair of the sermon wants to keep the
[37:20] worshipper Clinton keeps them clean
[37:22] don't make them clean blood Jesus Christ
[37:24] what makes you clean not an angel but
[37:26] that angel tastes the burner thanks to
[37:29] the cold off of the altar and what comes
[37:34] to every day and sanctifies you yes not
[37:39] your soul your soul just hardly done it
[37:44] sure it's your spirit that he's working
[37:47] on we ain't got that yet our soul is not
[37:51] up and down that's right I so it's not
[37:54] we believe the word one day and we know
[37:56] we see this know that your memories
[37:59] encaustic mental because brother Graham
[38:01] said you either favor valuing yourself
[38:03] there is no gray area is that it's
[38:06] already record even you're sold already
[38:09] Raptor synonym replaces it's already
[38:11] done finished completed there's not
[38:13] enough to be done amen but your spirit
[38:16] is what that burner comes through and
[38:18] burns that out that old what that old
[38:21] Fox is the old box that you have he
[38:24] burns them out all right so we'll get in
[38:25] a big sale and we'll read it next Sunday
[38:27] let's go that's great god bless yet
[38:31] [Music]
