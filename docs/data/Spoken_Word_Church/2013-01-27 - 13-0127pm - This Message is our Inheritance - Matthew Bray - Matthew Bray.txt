jude chapter 1 verse 17. praise god how many believes in the spoken word amen you believe the spoken word interprets the written word right the spoken words the original seed amen amen praise god when brother peter stood up on the day of pentecost he spoke something verbally right interpreting the written word right this is that which was written by the prophet joy amen amen this verse 17 here says but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you let's pray blessed father god i so appreciate your goodness your mercy lord how your hand is upon this people father leading guiding and directing in this open word lord god and just as my brother ministered this morning father the faith has been restored their apostolic realization the very living presence the pillar of fire the angel of the lord god your mercy and your grace are so rich to us in these last days god asked that you just open up our hearts anoint each and every one of us to hear what the spirit is saying lord and just so help us god move forward in our maturity and our understanding and in our fellowship with you lord jesus we want to just be obedient to you lord and fulfill all your will and all of your pleasure i thank you for my brothers and sisters here in this assembly and we just look to you now father god just pray you hide me behind the cross and just help us lord god let everything be god breathed lord that your saints can be fed and edified and made ready in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you my brother sisters you can have your seats there we just been doing what y'all been doing having a good time in this world just feeding on it amen the holy ghost feeds on the word is that right and uh we just get in there and we study this message as best we can and just let the leader of the holy ghost in our services and we just go from from just you know one service to the next service just following the leading of the lord and and the message becomes more and more real to us realizing that the message was sent to interpret scripture right absolutely realizing that the spoken word is a key that unlocks the written word and as brother branham admonished us and told us this book has become a brand new book amen and i've always felt to admonish message believers to absolutely take the message back to the bible right amen amen and today by the grace of god we have this grace afforded to us this this open book and we can see things in the view amen brother dale in the view of the whole bible from genesis to revelation amen no longer denominational guesswork but thus saith the lord the absolute of thus saith the lord and not just by somebody standing up and giving some nice speeches or some nice sermons but with vindication right but with absolute vindication amen amen and haven't realized what god has done by sending a vindicated prophet to give us the true interpretation of the word right amen that is absolutely priceless amen and we get to where we talk about these things and some people might scratch their head and just wonder what in the world does all that really do for us having the interpretation of the word so yeah right you got your doctrine straightened out what's the big deal well my bible said faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god and if the bible's sealed up then their faith can only be partial their faith couldn't be perfect is that right but in these last days with an open book the word has become unveiled and now our faith can be perfect a perfect faith amen amen and we all know that faith and love are sisters you can't have one without the other if you got perfect faith you got perfect love amen perfect love is existence at the same time perfect faith is right amen i believe that don't you draw on that capstone you've got love and we believe this message is a capstone revelation the unveiling the apocalypse the real faith that's been restored right they've been in these last days and now our vision can be perfect right and now this end time bride can reflect in perfection the husband of her soul right in the church age the thing was bailed it was sealed and they can only reflect what portion god was quickening into that church age messenger in that day right but in this last day a prophet comes on the scene ties up all them loose ends for you and me so we can amen in this hour walk out in perfection we got to believe that church right amen we got to believe that i know that a lot of times we kind of walk around this life in a in the condition of weakness sometimes just wondering why prayers go on answer yeah amen but his strength is made perfect in our weakness amen right amen amen the thing of it is is what we're looking at what your faith is studying amen what the revelation of it is that's the way it is right amen faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god glory if we're hearing the perfect word of god then we must be entered into or and have possession of a perfect faith i believe that don't you amen i believe the message is perfect glory i i don't believe if brother came back today i don't believe he had one thing to this message i believe it's just the way god meant it to me that's right it just takes anointed eyes as our brother preached today the revelation of coming together all right then we got to relax ourselves in the presence of god and let him interpret the word to our hearts put these things together all these quotes and all these sermons are just like pieces to the puzzle right the holy ghost comes down and anoints that word to our hearts and puts things together and we're seeing a picture a beautiful image amen amen some people might wonder now what does all this do for us having the perfect interpretation of the word having the vision sent having the word unveiled and all these things in the introduction of the church age book brother branham talks about why it's so important right right church ages gives way to the seals seals to the trumpets and the trumpets to the vials right exactly and he said that the study of the church ages is necessary for the understanding of the seal and then light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation is open before our wonder and eye that's right and then what and then we edified and purified by its spirit our what made ready right amen and then ready for his appearing praise god right that's right spiritual revelation is what we need to renew our minds right the renewing of our minds is what we need to be transformed amen amen it's important in it right but now you can see if god meant for us to really receive seed spoken words original seed and you see what satan has always been trying to do now for the last several decades the greatest battle ever fought is in uh and in your mind is where you receive sin amen that's right so it's satan's been on the job keeping people confused keeping them messed up putting their emphasis on the wrong thing exactly not realizing what the real program of god has been all along right and that is to just simply sit down and receive impregnation amen exactly receive seed glory is that right right we all know what happened in the garden of eden and the only way that adam had to redeem his wife was to put his life in her home is that right and in christ almighty in these last days has made a way to put his journal of life in the end time people is that right by the restoration of the apostolic faith through spoken word right is that right because the spoken words the original see and all these things here that we have in this hour i trust i'm pretty confident nobody in this church is shaken by all the riffraff and the rhythm of roar on the internet and all the the new websites in the books that's been written by people who profess to have been in the message for 30 something years i'm sorry but they had never been in the message my prophet said the message is christ in the token sermon he said the message is christ right is that right so you did it it's important as brother samuel dale preaches morning it's important to have a spiritual understanding right right you must have an approach to this message that's not intellectual exactly you don't approach the message with your mind you approach the message with your heart yielded and surrendered and submitted to god right brother says here in our first quote what is the attraction on the mountain i like this this is a good preaching quote right here amen he says but in the midst of all of it all of what all kinds of denominationalism organization half-stepping half-hearted dim-witted no spirit having intellectual approach in the word anything like this in the midst of all of it through every age and every prophet that had been or would be there's going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message amen i like what was brought out this morning the time is at hand it's time to understand glory is that right right amen that's right time to hear that message and brother brown said to hear is to understand amen because i said to see is to understand right predestinate to hear that message and they'll follow it right those ignore the crowds all right is that you today right no matter if the majority turns right around and says brother branham is not malachi 4 are you going to have that herd mentality that group think somebody with a revelation can't act like something right those ignore the crowns they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever and we got it heaped up today and they have no argument with them you knew it was coming right brother branham told you how they'd do it the christ the mystery of god revealed they'd come in there under the quietness of the spirit sit amongst you oh i'm a message believer oh yeah huh coming here all smooth and launching them pretty nice little websites huh apparently bearing record to the idea that god sent a profit oh yeah coming in and then after a while satan pumped that filler full of poison and spread around the whole church wood right christ the mystery of god revealed brother graham said satan ain't gonna like like leave this like this right back and what was preaching this morning we preached the same thing down there the bride ain't going through tribulation but you rest assured today's faith is good but you're going to need more tomorrow amen because it's going to get tighter that squeezes are coming on you can see it right we realize that now that squeeze is on every level and in every realm right politically financially religiously spiritually it's a squeeze it's a squeeze happening in every way and then every sense of the word as far as we're concerned because we see it happening right praise god the bride's not going to get caught in that squeeze she's going to be squeezed out again amen right be squeezed out of here we all know that god has a purpose for everything right as it was referenced this morning the message desperation and so forth all right those ignore the crowds they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they have no argument with them they've got one thing to do right that's believe and get every bit of it they can soak it in soak it in amen receive seed exactly amen open up your heart and don't try to think critically or intellectually just let the holy spirit wool over you and plant that seed amen and then let him water that seed praise god is that right they've got one thing to do that's believe and get every bit of it they can and soak it in like mary who sat at the feet of jesus amen ain't that good amen and that quote 1a my brothers just real fast i i'm sorry let me apologize i do kind of preach like buckshot just ain't no rhyme or reason or anything too much just just reach out and grab something that's fine but i hope you get it brother branch says now we're going to speak tonight on this one compound redemptive nature over jail and now to get the background of our story he says now everything you must not take just one little scripture to prove anything it must lay out in the whole view of the bible and as message folk this is the grace that's been afforded to us from genesis to revelation amen exactly i was telling church earlier this week you know i can tell you exactly where in this bible you can find the message let me tell you from genesis to revelation it's all in there amen old testament type new testament fulfilled is that right the husband is the old testament the wife is the new testament right when the capstone of the old testament came it was god incarnated in christ right amen the capstone of the new testament comes it's christ incarnated in his bride amen that's right both old and new testament amen right that's right i'm glad that the oil and that anointing is pouring right on out of it into our lives amen praise the lord now that quote number two this is something we hit quite a bit especially i like to hit this vision of message churches because i think it's important to be sober minded about exactly what all this is about what does it lead to what's the purpose what's the intent isn't that so we can draw swords on brother and fight over a doctrine or anything like this says now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture all right right is that right why is everybody so concerned about it seems like to me everything else but the rapture right oh my god exactly i heard a message preacher say one time man you can't think about the rapture too much it'll drive you crazy oh no the rapture to me is going to meet jesus how could that drive you free come on now right blessing i want to share this with you real fast i don't have this up here but uh brother branham was talking to somebody he said someone said the other day brother brown you scared the people i said what do you mean say well saying that jesus might come anytime you know bro graham said are you a christian that's a good question right amen are you a christian he says the world seemed to be in that same condition know that something is lingering there something's fixing to happen oh it's all over the internet all the people in the church world right see it builds up a pressure of course to the center but the christian who's instructed in the word ought to know that that's the coming of the lord amen amen and shalom it always gets the darkness before the dawn because the light is pressing the darkness is that right but i'm so glad today amen that it's been revealed to us that even though that evil apostasy would be existing but at the same time arise shine for your lightest cause is that right those two conditions simultaneously existed as it was with the children of israel in goshen they had light but in egypt they had darkness that could be felt right brother brown took his text in isaiah 60 there when gross darkness would be upon the people but arise shine your light has come then shalom sermons he talks about the two existing conditions simultaneously one people being restored on their way to a millennium the other people being condemned on their way to the tribulation that's right just depends on where your faith is today right that's right it's something church this message is so serious glory and it's amazing to me dealing with people trying to help people you know get unshackled from things and seeing message for people that's been in the message before i was born and let the cares of the life just drag him off into circumstance and situation and then the message be rendered ineffectual to him right that's a serious sad place to be but you don't have to stay that way you can believe god for a renewed zeal and enthusiasm and a revelation on this word and be restored back to your love affair and christ right amen sin and the things of the world will make you feel so lukewarm and weak and beat down and non-spiritual right you can't sit in front of television for four hours and feel spiritual ain't no way you can't even sit in front of the computer for a long period of time all them pop-ups and all them advertisements and everything like this we need to spend more time in the world what happened to brothers calling me on the phone say how i was doing now i get a text and an email come on man call me on the phone and talk to you know i don't feel much through a text or an email i like to hear it in somebody's voice how are you doing how you've been been thinking about you wanted to call you up what about them uh email preachers yeah they don't have a pulpit ministry so they think their ministry is you know emailing stuff all the time now i know i've been encouraged by emails but my goodness man every day 15 emails from somebody delete delete delete i ain't got time to read all that i've got a message to study in a bible to read yeah you know i mean no if you want to send me an email something encouraging go right ahead i'm just you can go overboard you know what i mean you don't know what i mean praise god i appreciate people like that always want to encourage folks and everything praise god brother braham says here someone said not long ago to me said brother branham you scare the people when you talk about he might come in the next hour i said scare what people right right not his people right right see that's the greatest note that we can sound right that's what we're looking for and i'm seeing this way too much talking about everything that's going on people call me up on the phone say brother matthew did you see the headlines in the news i said well did you hear what brother brown said right untold to you is that right right man that's right people getting all depressed about everything so look this message was preparing you all along with you paying attention to it amen that's right that's true isn't it right amen must lay in the view of the whole bible right coming of the lord how many countries did he say there was it's three cunnings right come first to redeem his bride comes second to receive his bride and he comes third with his bride is that right yeah which one of those comings are we the most concerned with right now exactly right now something's happened right a mystery has been unfolding he descended with a shout out he's in the invisible union of a marriage union with his bride right now brother brown said in proving his word we don't go to the marriage the marriage takes place on earth we go to the wedding supper that invisible marriage union is a reality right now first corinthians chapter 6 verse 17 he that is joined unto the lord one spirit right you can't separate a believer from christ right you can't separate the bride from christ that's the revelation of this message oneness between christ and his bride oneness i got that sermon oneness man i thought brother brown was going to break down the godhead he didn't touch godhead at all he talked about the oneness between god and his family right and it's a great thing that's opened up to us in this hour god coming down being so personal with his child opening the thing up walking in the believer amen making that believer know the hour to realize the scripture that's to be quickened right now all right brother brown said in the easter seal it took the quickening power to reveal to jesus what scripture he was to manifest in that hour right when he went into the temple and it was handed him the book of the scroll isaiah and he opened up and he found where it was written right and then in his last day god sends a prophet and he finds where it's written that's right he finds where it's written of him come on so we can find where it's written of us amen is that right and that same anointing that was on jesus was on brother branham and it's on the bride to fulfill what portion of scripture is wrote of her that's right that's where the anointing is amen brother samuel that's where the power is exactly that's why there's death out here in the other churches because they're not right where the spirit is quickening the word for this hour that's the difference between a message believer and a church member a real message believer knows what day and hour they're living in glory they know what portion of scripture has been fulfilled where it has been where it's all brought up to and what will be that's right is that right because the book is open right that's right and that holy spirit is anointing you to fulfill certain scriptures for this hour you got to believe that right right you got to understand that and realize there's a perfect realization of it all right exactly that's right as it was with the lord jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever that anointing come upon the bride in the last days you got to remember brother branham was not jesus he's bride and christ was veiled in his bride in these last days and he's the wave offering which is a sign and a promise that there's more to come just like him anointed right to fulfill scripture anointed to quicken the word amen glory amen now you know what i'm talking about there's certain scriptures laid out here throughout the bible that the end time bride is to change in the atoms and be caught away right there's there's something there written that's written like that right man first thessalonians 4 17 right but we which are alive and remain shall be caught up right somebody's got to fulfill that somebody's got to be anointed to fulfill that word exactly and the battle is well i don't know if i'm one or not yeah if you if you yeah received quickly and power in your soul you know you're wondering all right that's what that quickening power is for is to bring the word seed to life right is that right there's no such thing as a quicken believer not fulfilling the word right it's impossible right exactly a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that's right is that right amen that's what a true anointing is you know you know false anointed ones are just anointed to do manifestations and everything but they're off the word right but a true anointed bride has got mechanics and dynamics right she's anointed to walk in perfect and total agreement with the word right exactly that's right amen oh i wonder if i should get into this let's look here brother brown said something that really just astounded me one day he says here notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no in general being nothing else could take the place right and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture man exactly for the prophet to say that kind of makes me wonder man all right that's the most sublime thing in the scripture right revelations chapter 5 when jesus came and took that book and and i like to follow that don't you in the first chapter it's a sealed book but in the 10th chapter it's an open book right and when john was told to eat that book brother dale he didn't need a closed book right he ate an open book amen it was already open and he was eating on the open book exactly is that right come one becoming one with it you are what you eat exactly and we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the body word of the son of man exactly christ revealed out from themselves right amen christ unveiled amen exactly now i got to looking at this and uh and a couple scriptures came together that i really had a blessing of if you go to second chronicles with me this open book that we're talking about the restoration of the apostolic faith and everybody in here realizes that the apostolic faith could not be restored until actually the book was opened exactly the ministry was going on the first and second pool and so forth but really the restoration is the opening of the word right right the apostolic faith could not be restored without the revealing of those seven seals just study the message don't take my word for it but you'll find it in there you just follow what he teaches follow what he says and he'll be like wow duh it taken the revealing of the seven seals to restore the apostolic faith exactly right right so the restoration of this faith brother brown said over here was the very thing that was needed to get rapturing faith in the church rapturing faith would come when the seven thunders uttered their voices right exactly let me read it for you again just so you won't forget real fast he says this message oh i thought i had it right in front of me this message is to get the bride ready right and prepared for the rapture amen he says what can it do according to malachi 4 is bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers and our brother was ministering this morning and it was the it was like cover those statements you made brother it was like to me the entire message right just opening up right talking about the persecution that drove israel back to the homeland and that being loosed an ecclesiastical realm upon the brine driving her back in the message that's a quote amen i'm going to read it for you when we get to it here pretty soon and i'm sure your pastor is familiar with it when studying the message process before i was even a thought praise god oh brother i didn't mean to do it but i just mean you're more experienced the but uh you understand what i'm driving at i'm basically what i had in my mind brother dale was that i'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know that's what i was trying to say right but uh if it's the truth it always bears repeat maybe amen but uh you know on that's on that subject line there brother branham says that uh you know the homeland is the message right exactly being driven back into the homeland right and there's so many beautiful ways that brother branham brings that out because whenever the children of israel was called out by moses placed in the promised land by joshua they were coming back into the land of their fathers abraham isaac and jacob already dwelt in the land before they went into egypt right they were restored back to the land of their fathers this message restores us back to the land of our apostolic bodies so the history of israel is extremely important for us to be familiar with because you find yourself right there in the old testament right in the history of israel there you are being restored back the 70-year captivity in babylon 70 years of seven decades israel was carried away captivity in babylon and the church was carried away captivity into mystery babylon is that right and they've been restored back right restored back ain't you glad for that restoration amen been restored back and it's all over the message right you find out brother brown preaches a sermon here called paradox he's talking about the joshua commission right the first part of this sermon right here he says you hand me any bible right and i open up that bible right joshua chapter one exactly for years in my ministry you hand me any bible and it would open up to joshua chapter one until one day he seen in a vision a hand come down and the finger point to the first nine verses because the joshua phase started after the moses face died and he said moses the church age ceased with moses that's right i can read it for you i got to hear i just got it in my stats i don't mean to be all confused and everything but this message is exciting amen we've been restored all right we're not walking in old denominational guesswork even in the message has been referred to today in desperation brother brown takes a text out of jeremiah 29 and he's reading whenever god prophesied to jeremiah said that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you right here and brother brown is taking this text out of this in the sermon called desperation and i want you to hear what he says he's reading it in jeremiah he says it will be accomplished in babylon i will visit you and perform my good work towards you and causing you to turn to this place for i know the thoughts that i think of you and brother grant says isn't that sweet now you know he's not taking this text to preach about israel's captivity he's taking this text to preach about the church's captives for i know the thoughts that i think towards you he says isn't that sweet say the lord those thoughts those thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an accepted end like a body change yeah sounds good to me then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you right right and you shall seek me and find me and when you search for me with all your heart i will be found in you said the lord amen and i will turn away your captivity glory that's right no more part word no more shadow come on perfect light all right in this evening time we got perfect life and satan hates it but the gates of hell can't prevail against it right amen and i will gather you from all nations and from all the places where i have drove you said the lord and i'll bring you again onto the place which i caused you to be carried away captive back to pentecost right and he says i put that in there myself it doesn't say that that's what i was meaning to the church right there you go glory and then over and over and over in the whole message you find the prophet using israel's history to depict the reality that we're in right now have you fully realized the restoration are you taking full advantage of it are you eating it up glory realizing praise god their old denominational habits and thoughts and ideas is to be flushed away washed away forget about tradition walk in the grace of the lord amen now i had you in revelations 5 jesus coming to get that book and brother brown says that's the most sublime scripture in the whole bible right and these great things let me just read you a few quotes so you just get the impact of these next two scriptures i want to share with you where the branch says in the preacher he says now god's law required an innocent sacrifice and there's a substitute and who was innocent every man had been born sexual after sex every one and the only one that wasn't he forfeited the rights to eternal life and to be king on the earth king oh when i think of that scripture for thou hast redeemed us back to god and we may reign and be kings and priests upon the earth right here you go number three oh my the kinsmen redeemer oh what a story we would have here glory notice law required a kinsmen redeemer to redeem a lost substance grace met this requirement in the person of jesus christ glory a kinsman must be born of the human race ain't you glad hey that's the gospel right there right amen that's good news all right our other brother jesus did exactly what we needed him to do right and in these last days he kept all those mysteries stored up for you and i right right as the apostle paul said in corinthians chapter 2 we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world but the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world right to our glory come on that's right that's exactly right i'm so glad ain't you all right praise god he goes on to say here now notice in that fourth quote notice here he comes leaves the throne of an intercessor there's a slain land to become a lion a king to bring the whole world into judgment that's rejected see our kinsmen redeemer then is king over all right amen why he's got the title deed of redemption he's king why why because he's got the title deed of redemption right right see king overall why he's got the title deed of redemption right now you're in second chronicles yeah you remember the story of a failure athelia was jezebel and ahab's daughter ahab married jezebel jezebel polluted the northern kingdom israel they had a daughter named athelia and what did they do with her mayor hair off the jaws of that son and she corrupts judah just like jezebel corrupted israel right and in the church age you see brother branham bring out and pergamos means thoroughly wedded right church of state got together and then fighting the dark age was dominated female right right and then who shows up on the scene a failure the daughters right brother branham took atheia out of the old testament and typed it with the denominational jezebel and ahab had a daughter named fatty yeah and there you have church history right there and second kings and chronicles our church history right there right in the in the church age series you get that and brother branham mentions the failure twice in the church age book let's look it up ophthalia here she is in uh second chronicles chapter 23. joe uh i'm sorry a failure was so wicked she killed her grandsons tried to wipe them all out because they were in the lineage of david and one of them would become king right so she wanted to wipe them out so she could be ruler yeah you read this chapter but we're just going to read something here what happened in the first verse it shows you and in the seventh year a priest named jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azera and the son of jehoram and ishmael the son of jehovah in them in in these names right here i just wanted to show you in the seventh year so when that boy joash was seven years old the priest brought him out out of hiding because that one sister took that young boy the seed royal and hid him from a failure right to preserve seed so the seed could take the throne now what happens is if you read the story you can read it later on but ii chronicles chapter 23 but the priests get the people all organized to get ready to anoint this king and set him on the throne okay in verse 10 he says and he said all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple and the left side of the temple along the altar and the temple by the king round about right then they brought out the king's son joash little seven-year-old boy had put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony right what they did that king they gave him a book now go to deuteronomy 17 deuteronomy chapter 17 and this is where god was telling them how to handle a king what you what a king is supposed to do when a king comes to the throne of israel deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 14 if you happen to have a scofield it says concerning the king right there before verse 14. and i'm just showing you how perfect the revelation of the message is with scripture amen revelation chapter 5 brother brown says he's king now because why god abstract title deed in his hand and it was in israel every king that came to the throne he was given a copy of the book amen every single time it was to be carried out this way and here you have little joe ash they put the crown on his head and they give him a testimony the book and here in deuteronomy god's this is where god commands the thing to be done see when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee come on somebody when you come into the land your pastor said this message is my homeland we got a king headship came down and he had a book in his hand the bible's perfect amen this is what i'm excited about man i mean it's an open book is exactly what we're looking at see thou shall in any wise set him king over thee whom the lord thy god shall choose no one from among thy brethren or no one from among my brothers shalt thou set king over thee or excuse me one from among thy brethren shout thou set king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee right which is not thy brother oh man but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses for as much as the lord has said unto you you shall henceforth return no more that way right how in the world could somebody claim to be in the message and want to go join a church right it's impossible that's totally impossible i'm talking the nature the spirit the reality of it it is impossible right for a real message believer to ever get along in a denominational way right it's impossible now look at verse 17 neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law amen in a book out of that which is before the priest the levites amen the same thing the priesthood had the king was supposed to have a copy of it because when he's going to rule god's nation israel he does it by the book right he does it by the word right and that's how we pastor churches that's how we run our homes that's how we do everything in god's economy is by the book glory and then kings in israel was commanded to have their own copy of this book and what does he say here right and it shall be when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom they shall write him a copy of the law in a book of that which is before the priest the levites and it shall be with him amen and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord as god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes and do them amen so i'm just showing you how the bible lines up perfect right all these kings was supposed to have their own copy here's jesus brother brown says in revelations 5 he was a lamb but now he's a lion right come on fixing to come into his kingdom because what's he doing he's calling for his queen to take her side by him right side by his side right and what's he doing there he's receiving a book amen an abstract title d just like it happened with the kings of israel i think that's beautiful right all right i think that's wonderful amen praise the lord god and now our lord jesus christ didn't keep that book did he he descended with it with an oak after he loosened the seven seals and he told john who represents you right to eat the book right so where does this abstract title need to finally wind up in in you all right that's right exactly right you have a right to the tree of life all right brother said you have a right to it it is now your right to access the tree yes right that's right and it's just as simple as romans chapter 5 my friend right if you'd like to read it with me i'm sure you all are aware that adam and eve was blocked from having access to the tree of life and why lest they live forever right brother branham brings out in the revelation series revelations chapter four part one two and three that the cherubs that blocked their way was the four beasts he said there's only four ways you can go and they block the way to the tree of life all four ways they've locked it and got right so in the book of genesis you have four cherubims blocking the way but in the book of revelation you have four cherubs say come see you right exactly the way the access is now already you have access to the tree of life there's no reason for you as a believer to die in this age you can go home in a rapture now because the thing is open right back there i want that to be so emblazoned in my heart and in my mind that immortality has been opened right the passageway access to christ unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you he's made a way for his end time bride to receive life amen his literal life you know brother brown never preached a token till after the seals were opened right he never titled a message token right attacking token message came september 63. and he said the token is the literal life right amen hear him teach the difference between that and what the church ages had and you understand why we can be expected to be immortalized right exactly that divine life remember that that elisha and them were having lunch and they threw wild gourds in that pot and they said elijah's death in the pot and he went and got a hand of meal which is the type of christ and he re-leavened the pot with life exactly right that's what's been happening here we've been relevant with divine life through spoken word right that's right amen spoken word has been god's perfect will all along right he permitted us to come the way we did that wasn't his perfect will right but now we're born by the incorruptible seed of god's word romans chapter 5 says therefore being justified by faith revelation we have peace with god right through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access right i just want you to picture yourself walking right on past them cherubs right up to the tree of life and partake of the tree of life partake of him right because he's wide open the way is open amen it's by faith i'll admit to you it's my faith but it's there his presence has come down he had a prophet here to identify his presence right say he's right amongst you now right is that right i don't believe he left when brother branham left all right i don't believe that right he's still in that uh form of his angelic body the theophany moving in and out among his bride clicking in whom he will i believe that when you see this as eagle food you leave the other thing you've heard from your theophany that's right restore it back to your word body what you're supposed to have before the fall come on that's what this message does praise god you can't step it down stab a dead man in the back he's already dead praise god bless him be carried away into christ praise god aren't you glad amen right let's see where i am here now blessing i believe that the whole word has been given don't you amen there's quote after quote after quote the seven seals brought in the whole amen amen and the full power of its strength as it was when he was here the opening of the word means more to us than possibly we can even imagine right the opening of that word amen the advent of a vindicated prophet to reveal jesus christ being the same yesterday today and forever amen absolutely incredible listen to this he says now we have a sacred trust you know what a trust is and we have an inheritance a heritage that we inherit as believe in children it's a sacred trust and that sacred trust and our sacred heritage is the word of god that's been given to us right right exactly the full word of god glory not part word right full word right the word itself is the vitamin and glory right the word itself god's word that's where the reason i'm so dogmatic come on hear him explain that and spoken words original seed this is why brethren i've stood the way i have you can't bring forth wheat unless you plant weeds you can't bring forth a bride unless you sow for the bride all right i don't know what else we're supposed to preach go home exactly hey if the word of god don't turn you on it's not my fault right it's not my fault exactly if the revelation of the word don't stimulate you not my problem no i don't mean to be so sound abrasive and everything but i mean to tell you we're living in a time when the the effectual outworkings of the word is diminishing because the capstone age is honed down and the elect is coming into an absolute minority but i believe that the word of god is effectual upon those who are predestinated right amen and it's going to have its work that's right it's going to accomplish that which he purposefully comes amen amen so praise god let that word be effectual in us amen amen now i know y'all been studying the message and having a good time but i just want to encourage you to stay right there and start looking into these revealed truths because you're in this is what leads to your immortality right this is this revelation now you realize the new birth takes place by a revelation all divine healing takes place by revelation and your body changing the rapture ain't no different exactly it's got to be by a revelation by faith is that right so you ain't got nothing else to do but just stay right in the middle of the road stay with this word keep feeding on it and keep crying out to god to open more and more let that stimulation praise god come into your life greater and greater it's the stimulation that brain the revelation of it amen now uh praise god y'all don't look tired i ain't seen nobody young you're just encouraging me to keep going a little bit here now here's this quote this is what i kept hitting my mind when when my brother was ministering this morning my homeland is his message that's a direct quote out of gabriel's instructions today he says that uh talking about israel this is really really strong right here listen to this he says look at israel when they were sent down into egypt 400 years not one miracle not one sign not one thing happened among them not recorded in the history of the book same old nine and nine go to church offer the lamb say hell mary or whatever it was go back next year same way the priest all argued rabbi so and so we'll elect rabbi so-and-so and he's got a better scholarship he knows more about the egyptians the first thing you know the egyptians and all them was the salmon right oh what a horrible testimony what a horrible testimony right it was down in there for so long you couldn't tell the difference between an egyptian or an israelite right oh my god have mercy i feel like some message folk been here for so long they've done let down on the word they're let down on the standard and now you can't tell the difference between them and the world right exactly just because it's been 50 something years this upcoming march 17th will be 50 years since the sealed open yeah that don't mean that the word is not coming to pass just because as time goes by here don't mean god didn't still mean it god meant what he said through this problem and it still holds all right and it's still in effect praise god it's like the brother was preaching today 2050 wouldn't change his message one bit still be the truth right bill brown said there'd be a certain amount of people follow it right and they'll stay with it amen he says then he says here that's the same things happen to the church we've all went to be methodist baptist presbyterian we all got our degree out of hartford we got a degree out of wheaton we got a degree out of somewhere else or bob jones or got a bachelor of art we got a dd an lld or something other what is it amounted to a bunch of nonsense putting emphasis on the wrong thing right and people just that human nature seems to do that all the time remember since this message was sent to get the bride ready and prepared for a rapture right not just to have the message as a centerpiece on your coffee table not just to have a pretty bookshelf with nice books on it it's that word is to come spirit and life in you a life lived by the word would be the word expressed and he's come to take his word home in a rapture glory because it's the word joining with the word and he says and god never did deal with israel till she come to her homeland right exactly he says hear me thus saith the lord god will not deal with this church until she comes back to the homeland the message of the hour that's right all right that's the homeland amen and this is this is all over the message whenever you find you know how it is when you get a you buy a car and you think that you hardly ever seen your car around town very much then you get in and start driving around everywhere you look everybody got the same car you got it you just never noticed it before once these little things open to you either man that's nice and then every time you go the message that's all you see yeah exactly that's right it just got to be open to you a little bit and then that light will start shining that's right we've been walking in the homeland ever since 1963 when the word's been opened exactly god's just waiting for that light to dawn on his predestinated seat and bring her to a ripening right place right trying to get his church and speaking conditions trying to get his people matured realize what's happened of course you know invisible union of the bride of christ he illustrates the same point years later and brother brown was bringing out things about the seals in 1954. all right and the things he said in 1954 is exactly what he said in 1963 amen you'd get a whole lot of light on the seventh seal before the seals was even breached all right the raster knows pastor knows i feel sorry for these folks right here don't know the seventh seal has been open there's a lot of them too many of them right they need to get in that message and read what the product said brother branham was a master teacher gloria he could hide something and reveal something at the same time that's right and that's the way it is in this message you got to relax and let god be your lover let god be the one to lead you and guide you and show you flesh and blood can't give you anything right you've got to spend time with god in god's presence and take this word into the presence of god that's right praise the lord god i thank god for revelation don't you amen amen amen now invisible union of the bride of christ brother branham is implying the same thing that he's saying here about the homeland being the message yeah right he says now you may say what's this all got to do with thanksgiving because he's down there at jack moore's around thanksgiving in 1965 he says what are you talking about brother brown here it is quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about thanksgiving and he says what a message for the occasion to me gloria yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new found way of life being separated from the old english denominations and creeds they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for their age for their day amen what the holy ghost is quickening today right what jesus is doing now find out what part of this bible he's manifested today you'll find out where the anointing is you find out where the victory is you find out where the mind of god is god's trying to bring something to pass right like he did in every age he's bringing something to pass in this age so can we be thankful as pilgrims like abraham separate ourselves from the things of the world all of our associates abraham was a pilgrim god has separated us from all the dead religions i'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeds and to what separated us and opened to us a new land right a new message for this day amen amen let's go over here to joshua chapter 18. i don't have no quotes for this pastor but i'm just reading the bible and looking at what happened yeah perhaps you're already conscious of this but in joshua chapter 18 man we got into the adoption messages that message called paradox and we just listen to the message and read our bible right and it just opens up man just it's amazing what you find out when you read your bible in the light of a vindicated prophet right that's it in the light of the spoken word you read the scriptures that that's what god has done for us we need to be taken advantage of right in joshua chapter 18 what we have here it's explaining to us something that happened now moses placed two and a half tribes on the east side of jordan exactly okay amen those tribes was reuben gad and half the tribe of manasseh when they crossed over joshua immediately placed judah ephraim and the other half tribe of manasseh that's two and a half plus two and a half which is five right then how many does that leave out of twelve seven right so joshua here in chapter 18 it says and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh right tranquility place of god's rest that's where the tabernacle rested the ark of the covenant was there and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them and they remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are you slack right kind of reminds me when jesus spoke to his two disciples right oh slow of heart right yeah slow of heart lady will see it done question your eyes over right wake up to righteousness amen realize what's happened gloria and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are you slept to go possess the land which the lord god of your fathers have given you give out from among you there three men of each tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in their coast in the south and the house of joseph shall abide and they're closed on the north you shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god but the levites of course have no part among you for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben have to travel to nasa have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant lord gave them and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying go and walk to the land and describe it and come again to me that i may hear cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh now listen here and the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book amen and this bible is a seven part book come on right right the joshua ministry has repeated itself right in these last days you understand amen what was they doing they was getting placed positionally right adopted into the new land amen is that right right now don't take my word for this i'm just trying to provoke you right and poke you and pride you real adoption could not ever be really realized for the age until after the seals were open come on man exactly amen until after the seals were open right now here you have joshua telling the seven final tribes to go write their inheritance in a book bring it back to me and if you go on and read he stood in the door of the tabernacle in shiloh and cast lots and divided a seven part book right come on somebody amen sounds like something happened in these last days and described it by cities in seven parts in a book and came again to joshua to the host at shiloh and joshua cast locks for them is shallow before the lord and then in verse 51 and chapter 19 it says that uh divided foreign inheritance by light and shiloh before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and y'all know who the door is right brother branham stood in the door right he stood in christ amen right right right man god had to enter into that prophet to do this work right just like he entered into moses to bring out that word right god entered into brother branham brother brown stood in the door per se and divided a seven part book so the end time bride can receive her inheritance glory the new land that she's walking in the adoption replacing amen this bible is wide open amen you just gotta read it right you gotta meditate in it right brother brown said i love good singing but the greatest thing i have for enjoyment is meditating in the word right that's what he said man praise god and i don't feel like i shared anything with you you didn't already know because y'all are message believers today but god bless you to be edified and strengthened in this meet god help him be strengthened and edified and be enthused about it and be happy about this open word and this grace that god has afforded you in these last days to feed you and to bless you to strengthen you and to equip you amen to make you ready praise god well i love you all so much and thank you again for letting me share it with you dear people love you so much and uh we believe this message was sent for us to get us ready god amen put on christ amen god bless yourself god bless you amen remember our little group in mobile and we'll be praying for you all praise god and and i try to get my folks to sober up and realize just what brother dale was sharing today we ain't going through a tribulation but it ain't going to be a flowery bed of ease that's right brother i don't mean to keep preaching but you know what he said amen praise god the bride ain't no soft little thing right the believers of every age were rugged right right yes praise god god help you today love you right thank you thank you so much love you my brother appreciate you give our brothers when i started studying this message i said well they just ain't nothing else i like to read what somebody else says on this side of the other but right when it comes to the word they hear what the prophet had to say that way i could sit right down and feast on it seven course meals god never died when the prophet if you don't think about persecution a little tribulation you know coming to get us ready what about your prophets you must not want the third fool he says when the truth when the persecutions tried what's that dirt building evidently they put on it bring on the persecution yeah and we're singing about it is the greatest mystery that could ever be is that god used to live manifest himself in his people give him that race to jesus telling me hallelujah well make sure you tell my brother how much you appreciate the message and we believe it we appreciate it we said the word we said you hear other people that want to stand in the end when it's all falling apart but let it be it's got to be that way it's not that we try to find and see if we can all agree no it's to have the same spirit that will bring us all together in christ he'll just bring us together amen right because that's the way it's supposed to be then we don't have any trouble so you just make sure to tell the brother how much you appreciate it i appreciate them coming and being with us you honored praise the lord to bless them traveling back home there tomorrow and they're going home and just pray the lord bless them god each one all right remember the servant says wednesday remember pray for wade this weekend i'm sure now he's on his way down to brother claude whether you've got to preach for him or maybe already there you've got to preach for him there tonight and then he'll be coming
