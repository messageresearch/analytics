The king of all heaven [singing and music] and earth is living in me. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say he lives in you? &gt;&gt; Amen. For those that don't know it, that's my oldest son right there.

Good to have them with us. &gt;&gt; For those of you that don't know it, we were born in Gastonia, North Carolina, and we grew up in Lenor, and that's where Brother Scott Smith's church is. She's not &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; What will you do [singing] with Jes? Jesus [music] called Christ. Will you hear his voice? Will you walk in [singing] his light? The voice [music] of his resurrection has been [singing] revealed. The voice of [singing] the bridegroom. Have you heard? Do [music] you cling to [singing] every secret word? Is he your lover? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; or is he just [singing] a friend? Be it [singing] unto [music] me according to thy word. The voice of the angel I [singing] have heard. [music] Let the interpretation be [singing and music] revealed in me. I came [singing] to you with an empty womb.

[singing and music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was really good. I enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revealed word in our day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I know Brother Wade mentioned it before and I just want to mention it again. Just because you don't sing don't mean you can't testify. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We It's only It's only 10:15. We still got some time. I know we got some more songs, but uh we're gonna turn over to Sister Trudy. Let her come. She wants to testify and then she wants to sing also. &gt;&gt; And but I know the Lord's blessed y'all a lot this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so &gt;&gt; you can you can just even if you just get up and say, "I thank God I'm here." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you, saints. Um, as we get ready to end 2025, um, I just want to first thank God for trials, tribulations, &gt;&gt; and also thanking him for bringing me through those trials and tribulations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, we always talk about, you know, signs and wonders, follow the believer, but we mostly talk about the signs, but we don't talk about the wonders much. And I just I don't talk about my past a lot. And I just want to share certain things to I guess is for me back when I was living in Trinidad. Um, I wasn't a Christian then. And I remember I was probably about 18 or 19 years old and I was laying in the bed and I was like, you know, not going down the right path. Um, my mom was doing the best that she could. My dad was living in the US and I saying to myself, Lord, if you get me out of this situation, I remember saying, I'll serve you for the rest of my life. But you know, you have these thoughts, these pin moments, and you go back doing whatever you you're used to doing. And I could remember one time I was in a party, a big open concert, friends hanging out, drinking, you know, everybody's happy. And I remember closing my eyes and saying, "Lord, people say this is the greatest show on earth, but I ain't feeling it." &gt;&gt; But still, I wasn't a Christian yet. And it came a time I was probably 19. My dad came to visit. At the time he was living in New Orleans and he said, "You know what? I'm going to file for you for you to come to America." So I was like, "Yes, this is my opportunity to leave this place. Start over fresh because you know I'm not going down the right path right now." And I came, there came a time, Kurt and I were friends back then and he actually asked me to marry him and move in and do all that stuff and I was like that ain't happening cuz I'm trying but I didn't sorry let me let me rephrase that. [laughter] That's what I said in my mind. I never explained to him why I said no. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; And I said it in my mind because in my mind I just wanted to get out of Trinidad &gt;&gt; because I knew I wasn't go I wasn't going down the right way. And people will try to talk to me about God. I will just run like I ain't trying to hear you right now. I'm gone. &gt;&gt; And I was just running. And it so happened that my papers came through. I was getting ready to leave. and Curran. We had separated after I didn't answer and he came in the message first and I was like, "Oh, he a church boy now." I was like, "Okay." [snorts] So, I just like, "You know what? I'm going to jump on this plane. I'm going to start over brand new. Nobody going to know me. Nobody going to know my past. Nothing." So, I came to the US. I went to New Orleans for that where my dad lived. And my dad is a very difficult person. And the reason why I didn't want to go down that way with Kern at that time because I think to myself, my mama going to kill me and my daddy is not going to file them papers because he's a very different person to deal with. So if he say he's going to do something, you better stand in line to get that done. Otherwise, he gonna change his mind and flip of a dime. So I behaved myself. I came to America and Kern came to visit sometime for his for the August September time frame and unknowing to him before that sorry you know I was going through a lot and he presented the message to me and I said to him I hear you I believe what you're saying but I don't think I'm ready for that yet. And that was just honest me talking because I was going through something, but I guess God was calling me at that time and I didn't know what it was. So, I'm looking back now. I was like, you know what? He was with me all the time. &gt;&gt; And three years after that, Kar came back again with the message. [laughter] And this time when he came to visit, he had, you know, back in the day you had the CDs and he had to find a number to go with the message on the computer. So he had the whole flip book binder thing with all the CDs with the message. And I was like, okay, cool. I was like, we'll listen to one, see where it goes. And from there, my mind start changing. I start asking questions. Things start happening. They start clicking. And I remember we was on the phone talking and he said to me, he's like, "If I prove to you in the Bible that a woman not supposed to wear a pants, what you going to do?" I was like, "Well, if you can prove that, I will I'll listen to you. I'll believe you." And I was like, "Nohere in the Bible said that." Me thinking I know everything, right? [laughter] So, he told me the scripture and I'm flipping through and I read it. I was like, "Oh, say, okay, something happened." Now, at the time, I didn't understand what it was or what I was going through. And then one day, I heard Brother Sam said, "You know, when you're going through something and you get that prick in your heart and I was like, wait, that happened to me." And I was like, "Okay." So, we keep talking. We keep asking questions. And I mean, I had like $800 phone bill talking to this guy in Trinidad about the word. And I was like, "Look, I going to pay this bill, but I need to hear more." You know, and every time I go to work and I thought of something, I'll call him like, "So, what about this? What about that?" And he's just there gracefully answering all my questions. And he said, "Listen, I am not a pastor, so you going to have to find you a church to go to." So I was like, "Okay, fair enough." So, you know, both of us on both ends looking for churches and it came across two churches in Georgia that was listed on this site I was on. Can't find the website no more. And there was a church in Lincoln and it was this church. So, I sent it to him. I was like, "Well, I got these two churches. I don't know what to do. I got to make a decision." and he's like, "Well, we'll pray about it and God will guide you to where you need to go." And I came across the website here and I was like, "Okay, the profile looks good." It's like, "Okay, cool. I'll check it out and see." And I remember I was still in justification stage. And in justification stage, all kind of thing happens. You in, you out, you outside, you're not, you're sitting down, you're standing up. It's confusing. And I remember I went to my friend's house and we were playing regga music and hanging out and stuff and something said to me, I didn't bring you this far for this. &gt;&gt; And I was like, and then I remember that day when I was laying on the bed and saying, if you take me out of this situation, I'll serve you for the rest of my life. And [snorts] I just step away from everybody. I called the church and I guess that's when we used to have two services. I think Sister Jun answered the phone and I asked I was like, "Do you guys do water baptism?" And she's like, "Yeah." I was like, "Could you do it today?" She's like, "Hold on, let me find out." So I guess she went and asked for a deal. And I just jumped in the car and I started driving. And I was like, this place is far cuz I was coming from Stone Mountain and I was like where is this place? I'm on 985. I was like did I miss the turn? I was like I'm saying nope I'm not going to turn around because I promise I was going to do something because he did something for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm driving down the road and I finally I got to this place like an hour and a half later and I don't know what time service start. I just know I want to get baptized. I came out from the streets. Straight up the streets out of nowhere. And I I guess I got here like about 3:30. Service ended at 4. So I had no regards for time. And sure enough, Brother Dale said, "Are you the lady that called about being baptized?" I was like, "Oh my gosh." It's like, "Yeah." He's like, "All right, we're gonna have a baptism today." And that said day I gave up everything. Not and it wasn't me. It was Christ in me that I didn't know was there. &gt;&gt; And I can tell when I went through my sanctification phase &gt;&gt; after I got baptized again. I felt weird people talking to me and I was like, I don't know you. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to answer, you know. And you know, you're coming from being on the streets into the message and everybody's so nice and I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is like different up here in the country." [laughter] So, so we got baptized. I went through my phases and there was this one day I was again I was a single parent at the time and I was just going through cleaning praying and something just struck me. It's like the whole room is open up and like something got poured inside of me and then the room just closed back and I was like wow. From that day on, I had a joy that nothing can can can stop that joy. &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong, we have good times, we have bad times, we have trials. I just went through a medical situation the other day, but that joy was still there. Even though it's not showing or it's not abundant, it was still there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thank God. And I'm looking back and I was like, you know what? I'm looking back at 2025 and I was like, "No, my journey didn't started then. My journey started way, way back as an unrepented sinner, &gt;&gt; not knowing that he was calling me all that time &gt;&gt; cuz I wasn't looking for him. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking." So, I just wanted to share that with you because I don't really talk about my past a lot. I always talk about my America past, but not my Trinidad past. And um he's brought me through a lot. &gt;&gt; And um the song I'm gonna sing is Jesus I love you because he cared because he cared for unrepentant sinners prayer and he kept me through this time. &gt;&gt; So I hope the song is a blessing to your soul tonight. Not because I've been so faithful, not because I've [singing] been [music] so good. You always been there for me to provide my every need. You were there when I [music] was lonely. You were there in all my [singing] pain, [music] guiding my footsteps and shelter from the [singing] rain. And it was you that made my life complete. [music] You are to [singing] be my everything and that is why I sing. Jesus, I love you. Because you care. [singing] [music] I couldn't imagine if you weren't there. [singing] Jesus, I love you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; because you care. I couldn't imagine [singing] if you weren't there. You are my joy and my [singing] salvation. [music] You're the peace in my storm. Your love and arms protect me. You shelter me [singing] from harm. You are al for omega, the beginning and the end. My strong tower, [music and singing] my dearest and best friend. And [music] it was you that made my [singing] life complete. You are to me my everything. [music] And that is why I [singing] sing. Jesus, I love you. Because you care. I couldn't imagine [music] if you weren't there. [singing] Jesus, I love you because you care. I couldn't imagine if you wasn't there. [singing] Jesus, I love you. I love you. [music] Jesus, I [singing] love you. I love you. Jesus, [music] I love you. I love you. Because you care. [music] Jesus, I love you. I love you. Jesus, I love [singing] you. I love you. Jesus, [music] I love you. I love you. Because you care. [singing] Jesus, I love you. [applause] Amen. We got a little song here for the I was going to say the Roberts family and the Collins family. You know it's going to be special. Brother Kern's here. &gt;&gt; Brother Kern, he uh you got &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, man. It's always on time. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here we go. [music] &gt;&gt; Well, Daniel tells about a king long ago that built for all of Babylon [singing] an image of gold. Set a fiery hot furnace is waiting for you. If you don't bow and worship when I tell you to [music] read on a little further about three brave men who wouldn't [music and singing] bow to the idol know they wouldn't give in. So the king got mad and said boys you're through. Let's see if your God will deliver [singing] you. [music] Then they threw three [singing] men down into the fire. [music] They were bound [singing] and cast in a flame that was seven times taller. [music] They saw Shazorn [singing] [music] [singing] walking around [music] [music] and fire one. He said, "I set you free to worship as you wish. There's no other God that can deliver like this [singing and music] down into the fire." &gt;&gt; They were [music and singing] bound and cast in a flame that was seven times high. They got [music] shacked. [singing] suicide window [music and singing] and the fire is a dream in the for [music] walking around. Now if the enemies tied your feet and your hands, [music] remember the story. Remember the story [music] and the lessons we've learned. The ropes that tied them were the only [music] things. Yes, they threw three [singing] men down [music] into the fire. They were [singing] bound and cast [music] in a flame that was seven times higher. I saw Shack [music and singing] Shack. But who was that with a man of fire below [music] [singing] walking around and that's the kind of [music] God [singing] that I serve. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's [music and singing] the kind of God that I serve [music] right [singing] [music] with them in the fire below. Three men, but there were four [singing] men walking around. [music] There were three men, [singing] but there were four men walking around. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

Um hated it every second of it. Um I despised it. But it was my wilderness. Um, that's one thing that I've learned in the past seven months since leaving school is you never know what every what the day will bring you. And we often talk about how we often talk about how it's important to have faith and how we have to believe. But nobody speaks about the days when your faith is kind of there. Not when it's completely when it's kind of there. Like you're there, you have the faith, you believe, but it there's something in your heart that's just like, well, I've been believing for two years. I've been believing for six months. I've been believing for 10 years. and you just you want to keep walking, but that next step is just not going. &gt;&gt; You're trying to lift your foot and go, but it's not going. And this song I'm singing is uh by a brother um from back home, brotherly folk. Um [snorts] the name of the song is one uh translated is one day on the path. Um I was walking and I met the Lord. Um, and he walked with me. Like the verse that said, I was walking along the beach looking for the Lord. Look to my left to look to my right. I didn't see him. But when I looked behind me, there were two sets of steps. [snorts] So, he was walking with me the whole time. He was just inside. &gt;&gt; [sighs] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Angels who listen to my angels who listen to my [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So ooh and you don't want to be We don't [singing and music] give me sing.

It's been good tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh can I give just a two-minute testimony real quick? And forgive me, I got to back up to when I had heart surgery last year. the 20 2024 to till today. I'll tell you what happened today. Praise the Lord. But uh I was sitting in uh 2024. I pulled up a red light on a note in Thompson Bridge and I was sitting there and my vision literally changed. I went blind for a moment. My vision changed to a different level in my glasses for a period of time. Then it finally came back. go to the doctor and they told me I had type two diabetes. So I get insulin, I get oimpic and I get weighed 230 pounds. I got exmpic and some kind of insulin. I forget what it was that I took a shot seven days a week on Wednesday. I took two shots of Zimpic and the other insulin. So that books on down into when I had the heart surgery into uh November 2024 and I go in there and just go in for uh I was up here lead music and had a loss of air. I couldn't talk about this for a year. I just can now can share it with you and I apologize for that. But I want to thank Tony and everybody come to see me and brother Wade. And when I went to sleep and woke up, Tony was there. When if he wasn't there, when I went to sleep, woke up, Brother Wade was there. But I just appreciate that. But I'm trying to get up to today for one reason to show you how God is mindful of you. So I booked through uh all while I was in there, seven people died while I was in there on that floor coming out of recovery. And that made me determined I was pushing my way out of there. &gt;&gt; And I come out pushing hard and it was tough. &gt;&gt; But I get through that and get booking on and taking uh all the insulin still. Uh shot every day, two on Wednesday. Uh five different medicines. And then I decided to take some of my own little medicines to help things. So, I was taking 13 pills a day up until uh two months ago. And um so I go back uh in 2025, we start moving into things and I get going along and certain incident happened with me that uh broke me spiritually. I mean, it broke me, wiped me out and I was ready to give up on everything. And all of a sudden, I decided, you know what? I'm gonna forgive everything that happened to me and I'm gonna decide that I'm gonna pray the Lord that he restore unto me the joy of my salvation. &gt;&gt; So I had a brother come to me and he said, "Why don't you just leave here and go to church where your son goes?" My son used to go to church here. &gt;&gt; And uh so I go to I just visit because I he asked me to come and I was down low spiritually. So I walk in the church, they got screens big, twice as big as these. And on the screen it says, "Restore unto me the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; And I said, "God has got my attention." You know, so I go through that and uh get get through that and prayed and just laid it on my heart that I forgive everybody what happened in that situation. And uh so I go back I go every two months for a blood draw and they check me and see where all my medicines are and all that. And Ozmpic is with my insurance is like uh $2,000 a month and I can't afford that or not. I'm not gonna take it. But uh she's working on the doctor. I go to the doctor uh two weeks ago. They drew blood. All my numbers are excellent. &gt;&gt; AC1. My blood pressure 117 over 78. &gt;&gt; Three times it's been checked and that's where it's at. I can run a 100 yard dash and not get winded and my doctor told me not to do that. But I'm only 71. But anyway, I almost beat Abby Grace, but she got me by three or four steps up in Ohio. But anyway, to say that I I went to the doctor today and I want to say this and I testified with her how the Lord's been working. Back when my mother had degen of heart disease, she called me down the floor one night basement and said, "Come pray for me." Her anchors were swelling. I laid hands on her ankles and they went back to normal. I watched that happen. &gt;&gt; And God's worked in my life. I've been without jobs. Shut down five plants. Never was without a job over a weekend. Sister Peggy reminds me that all the time, but I'm just telling you, my God is real. Amen. &gt;&gt; And yours is too. But I go to the doctor today and she says, "U all your numbers are great. Your blood pressure is 117 over 78, whatever it was." And uh so I no longer take any insulin. &gt;&gt; No shots. That's been about eight months now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Six months, I guess. No insulin. But they said that Ozmpic has a benefit to it for heart disease. So they want me to get back on that. But I'm just going to believe that the Lord's going to work that out either way. &gt;&gt; And if it comes or goes, I don't care. I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; It don't matter to me. I just believe when my Lord if I lay down, he's going to raise me up. And I'm promise that one more time. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, if you're struggling with something, it is written. You just believe that it's been written for you. &gt;&gt; The brother the message we had the other day from the brother uh brother Long, the book being about you, man, that was that struck me. It's just wonderful. The message tonight about the rapture and I'm I believe that that's and I wanted to sing this one song and uh I'll see you in the rapture because I believe the we've got the word. It's here and it's time. Brother Dale talked about we're going to go past 2026 and we're about to enter into it. So time is at hand. Amen. Key of D on 604. I'll stop short it. It's 11:57. We'll just sing a just one verse of it. If we never meet again on earth is preious friend. If to God we have been true and we've lived above all sin. Then for us there'll be a meeting. There's going to be a greeting. [music] I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day. Let's stand. See, I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you at that meeting in the air. There with our blessed savior will [singing] live and reign forever. I'll see you in the rapture. Sing it one more time. [music] &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the rapture. I'll see you in the rapture. I'll [music and singing] see you at that meeting. in [singing] the air there with our blessed savior. We will live and reign forever. I'll see you in the rapture some sweet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, I'm I'm down to &gt;&gt; the [music] rapture. Two baby aspirins. That's all I take. &gt;&gt; Two baby aspirins. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Went through a lot there in November. And Sister Johnny passed away a couple weeks after brother Boyd had open heart surgery. So, but we made it through. We're all good. Brother uh &gt;&gt; Brother Boyd, he uh he's been through a lot, [clears throat] but you know what? He's still standing. He's still uh still serving the Lord &gt;&gt; and still singing the praises of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank all of you for the singing. Wonderful job. Pray for our our young people. Uh maybe going through some trials and tribulations that this year, Lord, that some of those things will be shed off as our brother said that it'll be a place to where we can come to where things start unfolding. I told you what I tell you. Whatever you got inside of you, you got to let it out. &gt;&gt; If it's if it's the new birth, then you show it to somebody else. If it's the devil, ask for the new birth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz whatever's inside of you is going to carry you wherever you're going. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And as I told the uh I did a funeral for a friend of mine um Saturday and um I told him, I said, "You can believe whatever you want to." I said, "But I'll promise you when you close your eyes on this side, you gonna open your eyes somewhere else." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You ain't just going to go away. You going to open your eyes one place or the other. You going This is not it. &gt;&gt; But thank God that we know who we are, where we're going. &gt;&gt; And we know what we're doing here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, praise God. We are 12:02. We're in a new year, 2026. We are in a time that we've never been before. Right. &gt;&gt; We've never passed this way before, but we're heading through it &gt;&gt; and we're heading to it. So, thank God for a year past and now, thank God for a year present. &gt;&gt; So, now we're going to take our communion and like again, I said again, thank you all for coming. God bless you. Uh we love you with the love of the Lord. Brother Scott, we'll uh get you back and preach for us again because we sure do appreciate that message. That was good. Very timely and very good. So, we appreciate that. Amen. [applause] So, let's read our scripture for the uh communion that we won't have any footwashing tonight. Uh we'll just have communion and then when we get finished, you can go downstairs and grab you a snack or something. But just be careful on the highways, be careful on the roads and uh watch out. There's a lot more crazy people than we are out there. &gt;&gt; So, let's read our 1 Corinthians 11 vers 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, Take heed, this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament." It wasn't the Old Testament. The Old Testament was blood of bulls and goats. It had nothing to do with the inward man. It only covered or capoed covered your sins. But this guy right here, he's fixing to take it away because it's the blood of a man. It's not the blood of a man. It's the blood of God. &gt;&gt; And that life inside that blood can come back inside the believer like nobody else can do. No one else can do this. But he's telling them, "This is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. So let's get everything clear tonight before we take our communion. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God that we are not condemned with the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tar one for another. If any man hunger, let him eat at home. it you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come. It took the Apostle Paul to tell us what happened in the upper room because it was told by a prophet with a vision. He wasn't even in the upper room but there were several men there that had different commentaries of different things but they God gave Paul the clarity as a prophet &gt;&gt; to give us the communion and what happened. So, um, right now we're going to tarry just for a moment and, uh, pray one for another [clears throat] and let's get all this settled. Here we are. Here we are, new year. Let's start a new year with a clean slate. Let's bow our heads. [snorts] Lord Jesus, just forgive us of our faults and failures. Lord, bless the people that are here and the ones that are watching in, the ones that couldn't be here, I pray that you'd be with them, Father. And as we take this communion, Lord, may it become a part of us, Father. And we realize [clears throat] that it took you dying at Calvary to save every one of us that's in this building. Father, I pray that you'd be with us now in Jesus name. Amen. The Bible said he took bread and blessed it. Dear heavenly father, thank you for this bread, Lord. It was made by holy hands. I pray now, Lord, it'll be at the service of this communion, Father. And we pray that you'd be with uh Lord, the ones that are partaken, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. I told you many times that one ministers that are here. When I was me and parents were kids, we were in the Baptist church and dad was a deacon and we would uh Brother Scott, they get little wafers in the mail and excuse me, and they would uh put it in the freezer. When they put it in the freezer, they'd bring it back out the next time we had communion. So, it wasn't fresh manta, that's for sure. Then we had Welch's grape juice. Excuse me. And I think they even cut it. Make sure nobody choked on it. But that's all they knew. That's everything they knew. But thank God for truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, thank you Lord for this wine. Lord, it's made Lord to be drank, Father. just a small portion to remind us, Father, that you shed your blood at Calvary. And Lord, for the remission of our sins, Lord, I pray that you'd be with each one in this building, Father. That Lord, as we take this communion, we'll remember you, Father, and go forward today in newness of life. Jesus name we pray. Amen. [cough] [clears throat] Excuse me. Come morning, I'll walk. I'll rest near the evergreen tree. I'll carry my cross through the midnight. [clears throat] Come morning, [singing] there's glory for me. Sometimes I'm despised. Oh, you feel that way sometimes, don't we? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And I question, oh father, how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on some morning. Boy, what a peaceful thing. &gt;&gt; Everything will be over with. &gt;&gt; There'll be no more sorrow, no more pain. There'll be nothing but just all glory will be in eternity. But we got to carry a cross now to get us there. Come morning there's glory for me. Sometimes [singing] I'm despised and rejected and I question. Oh father, how long? Then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on. While they're giving finishing, I'll give you a little testimony, brother. Oh, Scott, me and my wife, we flipped hamburgers too for a while and uh that's kind of how we met. So, thank the Lord for McDonald's. So, uh and friends that worked there. So, and we didn't kill each other while we were working there and we didn't have the Lord on our side that at that moment. So, so we but we made it through now for almost 47 years. So, &gt;&gt; but same way, brother, I uh I had a very foul mouth. I I could I could hurt people without hitting them. I'd hurt him with my with my mouth. And uh and I I hate I I didn't hate it at the time, but I hate it now. And I'll tell you a story just real quick. You talk about going through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and how God will take these things out of your life. I was driving down the road. Some of you already heard this. I'll tell for the ones that the new ones. I was driving down the road. This was after I had received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I was driving down the road. I was going from Gillsville to to Mazeville and uh I was talking to a friend of mine that was I had knew that we were both saying the same words that that I said. So we were buddies, you know. I mean we we said the words together and we hunted together and fished together and said bad words more than we said good words. And uh so uh I was talking to Ken and and something happened and &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; Why' you throw Ken under the bus? I'm so Well, Ken ain't watching this. Terrence knows Ken. He's a good buddy. He's a You know what? He's a he's a he's a guy that I believe a cup of water because after I got born again, he never shied he never shied away from me. He [snorts] never uh he never said anything about it about me not hunting on Sunday anymore. But going down the road, Brother Scott, we were talking about something. We were riding we were talking about hunting. We were talking about getting into going somewhere and and something [clears throat] happened. a dog run a crossroad or something and I started to say oh &gt;&gt; and I know y'all run that through your head already the s word [laughter] and when I started to and I was going to say it when I when I when that word got right here it's like something hit me right here in the chest and I just went oh and that was it. I knew that that was gone &gt;&gt; because the old me would have said it. &gt;&gt; Really normally would have said it. But when I got ready, the old the old guy was still around, the old, you know, the old spirit guy. And I got caught up and and and God didn't let me do that. He hit me right in the chest and blowed all the air out of my out of my lungs just to protect me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to tell me that he saved me &gt;&gt; and he changed me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's take communion. Amen. God bless you. All right. Give it to him. We've had a We've had a a wonderful service. Yeah. I made that stout. Y'all like that? [laughter] Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I made that one just for y'all. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Happy new year. &gt;&gt; That give you some spirit there, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody see, look at that. Everybody's like, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I think that came from last year. I made a better batch this year. So, hey, you know what? When I made it, I said, "Lord, this is going to be drank by holy people, by people that that are that are wonderful people." And that might have just a little bit extra vinegar in it, but you know what? It'll clear your throat. Those of you that are sick, if you need another one, you can have it'll clear you out. &gt;&gt; I wait till they get finished. [snorts] Amen. All mind's clear. &gt;&gt; Thank you all for coming. M. Thanks for coming. Thanks for bringing your mind with you. And uh AJ, good to see you again, buddy. And and the young man there. You've been here before, had you? Yeah, I thought you had. Okay. Good to see you, brother Sherees. God bless you, buddy. Love you with the love of the Lord. You be careful going back home. And uh tell brother Dutch we love him. And uh we'll see him soon. So, all right. God bless you. We're going to uh pray for me. I'm leaving in the morning. Uh heading to Ohio to hunt for a few days. Brother David Gadman will be here preaching Sunday and then Brother Aaron will be preaching next Wednesday. I'll be back by Wednesday and I'll be in service, Lord willing. So, uh just keep us in prayer. that the Lord will be with us all and this is the new year. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for getting us through 2025. [applause] &gt;&gt; As our brother said, [applause] it's been a struggle. We've had ups and downs and ins and outs, but you're standing right here capable to hear the voice of God still speak to you. &gt;&gt; Then you ought to be the most blessed people on the earth. is to know where you are, know where it's at, &gt;&gt; and you know what? Know how to get it. &gt;&gt; It's there for all of us, but only a special group of people is going to get it. &gt;&gt; As our brother said, the bride of Jesus Christ is the only ones going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Chris said last Sunday, he said, "That's why it's a little book that comes down with a mighty angel because it's just the names of the people that are his bride." &gt;&gt; John eats the book. And then now here we stand. We are the book. &gt;&gt; We're not going to carry Bibles in heaven. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; We're not going to carry iPads, &gt;&gt; iPhones. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any AI cuz it's going to be real. &gt;&gt; But you're not going to need a Bible. You're going to be a walking Bible. &gt;&gt; The day of judgment. There's not going to be a great big book. You're going to be standing there because you're the book. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You're God made manifest in flesh through that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads just for a second. Thank you, Lord. We pray that everything has been done, Lord, these past four hours has been done for your honor and glory. Lord, we've sang songs and we've seen people pour their heart out in worship, Lord, and our our brother poured his heart out, Lord, in the speaking of the word. Father, I pray that it doesn't that it doesn't return void, but you said it would. You said it would accomplish what it set out to do. Father, be [snorts] with each one, Lord, as we go downstairs. sanctify the food, Lord, and be with us on the highways as we go to our separate ways, Father. The We know what the world's doing outside, Lord. So, just protect us and keep us safe, Father. We thank you for this building we have. Thank you for the congregation that we have, Lord. And we pray that you'd be with us now to continue [snorts] through 2026 for whatever you have for us, Lord. And if we don't stand here in 2026, December 31st, that'll be just fine. We'll be with you. &gt;&gt; Father, just bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. [snorts] Take the name of Jesus with bless you, brother.
