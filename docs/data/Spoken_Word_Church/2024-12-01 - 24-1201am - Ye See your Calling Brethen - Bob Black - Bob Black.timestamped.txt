[0:00] we got plenty to eat and are coming
[0:02] ready to get some more to eat
[0:04] today and uh We've sure had a good time
[0:09] with our
[0:10] family it's good to have everybody
[0:12] together and
[0:15] uh that that makes it all
[0:18] worthwhile let's bow our heads to the
[0:20] Lord Lord we're so grateful to gather
[0:23] together around your word today Lord
[0:25] Jesus I pray God that you'll just bless
[0:26] us Lord as we walk through these
[0:28] scriptures
[0:30] Lord we thank you Lord God as you give
[0:32] your word to uh it it seems like you
[0:35] bypassed all of the wise and all of the
[0:38] ones that uh you chose the like Paul was
[0:41] saying here the weak ones of the world
[0:44] the weak ones to give your to give your
[0:47] your goodness to and we're so grateful
[0:49] Lord this morning we've got plenty to be
[0:51] thankful for and so we thank you Lord
[0:53] for everything you've done for us we ask
[0:56] Lord as you just Quicken the word to our
[0:57] hearts this morning Lord and give us
[1:00] what we have need of
[1:03] Amen
[1:05] now I I don't have any slides this
[1:07] morning so if you got your Bible we'll
[1:08] just turn to First cor 1 Corinthians
[1:11] chapter 1 and uh look in verse 26 where
[1:16] we were kind of studying last
[1:19] Sunday and uh you know we we're we're
[1:21] kind of looking at some of the things
[1:23] Paul told to the Corinthians who were we
[1:26] laid out the last couple of uh lessons
[1:29] that you know the Corinthians were is
[1:31] that Greek city that
[1:33] um lived in a just a lot of debauchery
[1:36] they had U the way that they worshiped
[1:38] was just steeped in sin and go up to the
[1:41] temple and had all the temple
[1:42] prostitutes and different kind of things
[1:44] and and so Paul is uh you you be when
[1:47] when God gets a hold of your life you in
[1:50] that especially in that age just as it
[1:52] does in this AG it certainly sets you
[1:55] apart and makes you look odd and
[1:57] peculiar and and different and so Paul's
[2:00] framing it up to these Believers in
[2:02] verse 26 he said for ye see your calling
[2:05] Brethren how that not many wise men
[2:08] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[2:11] noble are called and of course they were
[2:14] in that in that Greek City where you
[2:16] know there was a lot of Education people
[2:18] U studyed the different languages they
[2:20] had all this understanding but he's he's
[2:23] he's he's laying it out for him that it
[2:25] it looks like God just bypassed all that
[2:27] wisdom and all the uh religion people of
[2:30] the day just like he has done today but
[2:33] he says in verse 27 that God ha chosen
[2:36] the foolish things of the world to
[2:38] confound the wise and God hath chosen
[2:40] the weak things of the world to confound
[2:43] the things which are Mighty and base
[2:46] things of the world and things which are
[2:48] despised hath God chosen yay and things
[2:51] which are not to bring to not things
[2:53] that are that no flesh should glory in
[2:56] his presence but of him are ye in Christ
[2:59] Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom
[3:02] and righteousness and sanctification and
[3:05] Redemption that according as it is
[3:07] written he that glorieth let him glory
[3:09] in the
[3:10] Lord now I I love how Paul packs so much
[3:14] into the things that he saying he he's
[3:16] saying that God will take something that
[3:18] a gospel that the world thinks is just
[3:19] foolishness and will save somebody
[3:21] that's just nothing that God can take
[3:23] something that seems like nothing and
[3:25] save somebody that looks like nothing
[3:26] and make them something and and he'll
[3:29] take the base things of the world and
[3:31] and and and so he's laying all this out
[3:33] so that we know that there's nothing
[3:34] there's nothing in ourselves that we can
[3:36] Glory of and that's really when to
[3:39] meditate on that scripture for you see
[3:41] your calling when you're you're called
[3:43] to Salvation you're called to a purpose
[3:45] there's nothing in yourself that you can
[3:47] Glory of because it's God that did the
[3:50] whole thing when you get you know you're
[3:52] sitting at home maybe and you the
[3:54] mailman comes and you get an invitation
[3:56] to a wedding and you you get that nice
[3:59] looking envelope and you open it up and
[4:01] it says your it's got your name in it or
[4:02] whatever but you didn't invite yourself
[4:05] it's God that give you an invitation and
[4:08] you accepted it now that's really just
[4:11] really see that for if you see your
[4:13] calling to see your calling then you're
[4:15] resting on the uh being identified with
[4:19] it what what God when God calls someone
[4:23] that's predestinated before the
[4:25] foundation of the world and you
[4:26] recognize it it ties you back to the
[4:28] Eternal eternal etal thought of God so
[4:31] your call what is your calling it's it's
[4:33] an invitation to a feast or the Divine
[4:36] invitation to embrace salvation in the
[4:39] kingdom of God you know you so a call is
[4:44] is is something that that you cannot
[4:47] initiate which is what is laid out for
[4:49] us in John
[4:51] 6:44 where Jesus said no man can come to
[4:55] me except the Father which hath sent me
[4:58] draw him and I will raise him up at the
[5:01] last day so to draw means metaphorically
[5:05] to draw by an inward power or to lead or
[5:10] impale now you we we've all experienced
[5:14] that in our own Liv I sure have
[5:15] experienced that you know you you
[5:17] growing up in a message you know in the
[5:19] message you you we'd have the tapes
[5:21] playing in the house and it just like it
[5:23] just fall on deaf ears you know my uh my
[5:27] daddy had read us Bible stories and and
[5:30] at at night and sometimes I'd sleep
[5:32] through it and you'd come to church and
[5:34] you just well you know it's just it's a
[5:38] thing but then one day the father gets
[5:42] to work it on your heart and he begins
[5:44] to draw on you so no man now this is
[5:47] such an important scripture because it
[5:49] seems like we you know we get frustrated
[5:50] with one another sometimes get
[5:52] frustrated with your kids I I we were we
[5:55] were sitting around talking the other
[5:56] night about a young man or or I'll say a
[5:59] young person that we were we were you
[6:01] know just watching over the years and
[6:04] and
[6:05] uh you you want them to come to the Lord
[6:09] and and you get simply kind of like real
[6:11] frustrated and everything but uh but you
[6:14] know God's got everything in his time
[6:16] and and you could you could take a
[6:18] paddle and and whoop him or and I'm not
[6:21] talking about Zach I'm just talking
[6:24] General that sounds like I'm talking
[6:26] about Zach but I'm
[6:28] not maybe those things could apply to
[6:30] him though it applies to all of us cuz
[6:34] you know you could you could you you
[6:36] just in the gospel a minister stand by
[6:37] in the pull pit you want to take a
[6:39] gospel paddle sometimes and why don't
[6:41] you move why don't you do something but
[6:43] there's that scripture laying here that
[6:45] no man can come to me except the Father
[6:48] which has sent me
[6:49] drawing now that's what happened with
[6:51] that that uh uh you know Billy Paul
[6:53] started come back to church and the
[6:54] Deacon come up and trapping him on the
[6:56] shoulder and or and and see we it don't
[6:59] don't work that way it's not by force
[7:02] it's not by compelling no matter how
[7:05] much you want to take somebody by the
[7:06] lapel and drag them to the altar it just
[7:09] won't work that way but and and aren't
[7:11] you glad it doesn't work that way
[7:13] because because because that what Paul
[7:16] is saying here he that glortho in the
[7:19] Lord in other words there's nothing that
[7:21] I did and nothing you did all all
[7:24] brother brandom says that we do is we
[7:26] preach the gospel and we cast the net
[7:28] and then God can go to work and begin to
[7:30] drawing and wooing at somebody's heart
[7:33] now that's when you see your calling
[7:36] that you didn't give your heart to the
[7:37] Lord because you were afraid your Mom
[7:39] and Daddy got you afraid and and and all
[7:41] these kind of things but because it was
[7:43] a real genuine calling that God got to
[7:47] work it on your heart and Pull and draw
[7:50] drew you to himself now see it's a call
[7:52] though is not something that you can
[7:55] initiate because we're in this sinful
[7:57] state that we're living in
[8:00] back there you know when Adam first did
[8:02] the thing that he
[8:03] did and and uh you know they they uh got
[8:08] one word off and so forth we know the
[8:09] story and and he he got got his fig
[8:12] leaves and went hiding behind the bushes
[8:14] and here comes God calling for him Adam
[8:18] Where Art Thou now that's the same thing
[8:22] I I forget what sermon it is but brother
[8:24] R lays out that that's actually what the
[8:25] father is still calling Adam Where Art
[8:28] Thou he's doing it through through the
[8:29] ministry through the preaching of the
[8:31] Gospel that when you come to church he's
[8:32] crying out for you and you're sitting
[8:34] there hiding behind your fig leaves and
[8:36] all the things that you're trying to do
[8:37] to twerk up but but but it's God
[8:40] actually drawing you a calling for you
[8:43] and and and then if we'll respond then
[8:46] we can see our calling God
[8:49] called you look at like Cain and
[8:52] Abel isn't it interesting that God
[8:55] called and laid out the path for both of
[8:57] them just like he laid out the path path
[8:59] for Jacob and Esau but only one was able
[9:03] to recognize the calling and respond you
[9:07] you think God laid out to Esau right
[9:09] just laid it out why don't you do like
[9:11] your brother or or to to to Cain why
[9:14] don't you do like your brother and and
[9:16] and just bring uh but but only Abel was
[9:19] able to actually listen and heed and
[9:22] hear by our
[9:24] Revelation right God called but only one
[9:27] had a calling in both of their lives now
[9:29] brother R said in the infallibility of
[9:30] God's spoken word he said man in his
[9:32] nature is a
[9:34] Castaway he's an alien he's away from
[9:38] God then God by Grace has to draw him to
[9:41] his own side all that the father has
[9:44] given me will come to me no way at all
[9:46] there ain't enough picture shows enough
[9:48] dance halls enough burlesque shows in
[9:51] the country to keep you away from
[9:53] God when God goes to draw back Yonder
[9:57] before the foundation of the world when
[9:58] he put your name down that you'd come
[10:01] you're coming that's all that's all he
[10:06] said now oh you might be a hypocrite and
[10:08] work up and say this that or the other
[10:10] but I mean when God
[10:13] calls now now look think back in your
[10:16] own life I I I sure do remember when God
[10:19] called me it wasn't just some kind of
[10:20] education or theology or something but
[10:22] it was something Supernatural that began
[10:24] to pull in my heart right and you
[10:26] recognize when it when it's when it's
[10:27] different you ain't just going to school
[10:29] and sitting there watching somebody draw
[10:30] on a chalkboard or something but it's
[10:32] something real Supernatural begins to
[10:34] tug and pull at your heart I I I
[10:37] remember sitting there in church one
[10:38] time watching this young man it seemed
[10:40] like just a we were in Columbia South
[10:42] Carolina when I was a young boy and I
[10:45] remember it just seemed like just kind
[10:46] of a boring service and everybody you
[10:49] know you had sleepy people in there but
[10:52] then from the back this young man come
[10:54] up and he was just tears falling down
[10:56] his face and and he it seemed like the
[10:59] preacher wasn't preaching any kind of a
[11:01] special sermon he was just laying out
[11:04] some things and and people on the front
[11:06] robow tired and sleepy but that God was
[11:10] moving in that person's heart and see
[11:13] that's that's the difference that when
[11:15] God begins to call and pull at
[11:17] somebody's heart something is going to
[11:19] happen and it ain't CA mama or daddy did
[11:21] something or it ain't cause you know
[11:23] maybe the preacher said something
[11:25] special but God is the one that does the
[11:28] drawing now see that's the thing that
[11:30] makes the difference is God God does the
[11:32] calling and the Seal of Christ he said
[11:35] some people come to church just for the
[11:37] emotional part some people come to
[11:39] church just to sing some people come in
[11:41] church just to enjoy the good singing
[11:43] That's All Right some people come to
[11:45] church and join church just to hide
[11:47] their meanness make themselves a little
[11:49] better name in the neighborhood some
[11:51] come to church sincerely but don't ever
[11:54] have a touch from God but when God calls
[11:56] a
[11:57] man no man can come come to me except my
[12:00] father draws him first and all that
[12:02] comes I will give him everlasting life
[12:04] raise him up at the last day oh I hope
[12:07] you see it brother it's the work of the
[12:10] Holy Spirit revealing to the
[12:13] individual not upon some emotion not
[12:16] upon something you should do or
[12:18] shouldn't do or this that or the other
[12:21] all those things are all right the moves
[12:23] and works and shouting and dancing and
[12:26] speaking in tongues all those things are
[12:28] all right
[12:30] but the first thing it has to be a
[12:32] spiritual Revelation that God has given
[12:35] the individual that Jesus Christ is the
[12:38] Son of God calling that's right without
[12:42] that brother you're only impersonating
[12:43] only pretending now you think about that
[12:46] how simple that can be you just sitting
[12:48] in church and then God reveals to you
[12:50] that that's God calling you uh that's
[12:54] what Paul's talking about when he says
[12:56] you see your calling Brethren that God
[12:58] can take somebody and pluck them out of
[13:00] the Gentile World out out of that that g
[13:03] that Greek world of wisdom and not many
[13:06] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[13:08] not many noble are called but God ha
[13:11] chosen the foolish things of the world
[13:13] to confound the wise and God hath chosen
[13:16] the weak things of the world to confound
[13:18] the things which are
[13:20] Mighty that's why Paul could say in
[13:22] Romans chapter 9:
[13:24] 16 so then it is not of him that willth
[13:28] nor nor of him that
[13:30] runneth but of God that showeth
[13:33] Mercy in other words salvation is a gift
[13:37] it's not something earned or deserved
[13:40] your calling is not something that you
[13:42] did to get it or that something you you
[13:45] Merit or something that you you you feel
[13:48] entitled to but your calling is a gift
[13:51] like we were you know we a few Sundays
[13:54] ago we were doing that little exercise
[13:55] where I had the envelopes and you know I
[13:58] I had some name names written on them I
[14:00] think it was brother Terrence and Louise
[14:02] and and I forget somebody else um and
[14:06] and I I wrote the name down and then you
[14:08] know give it out call you and then give
[14:11] it out and and that's playing out
[14:13] exactly what's happening in church when
[14:15] as the gospel is being preached it's
[14:18] actually giving you it's actually
[14:20] calling what God thought of before the
[14:23] foundation of the world and when you
[14:25] receive it well there you got your
[14:27] calling there you got it there in your
[14:30] hand you got that envelope with your
[14:32] name on it and so that's what Paul is
[14:34] trying to explain to the Corinthians you
[14:37] see your calling Brethren if you got it
[14:40] and you recognize that it ain't some man
[14:42] or your mama or daddy that called you
[14:44] that that you've got something that God
[14:46] give to you that identifies you with his
[14:49] thought from before the foundation of
[14:50] the world now you so that means your
[14:53] calling your calling is not just
[14:55] education which is what Paul gets over
[14:58] to in the next chapter CH he starts
[15:00] talking about I didn't come to you with
[15:01] enticing words and things but I come to
[15:02] you with power the expression the
[15:05] expression of deity reveal through these
[15:07] words that I'm preaching to you what we
[15:09] need brother Randon would say what we
[15:11] need is not education and you know the
[15:14] reason why he said that he's saying
[15:15] these things that might be sound a
[15:18] little bit confusing but he said you
[15:19] know when I went to school we had uh
[15:22] we'd go to the the the math class or you
[15:25] know the algebra would be real difficult
[15:27] to it math was hard for me it it was it
[15:30] was not easy and and youd get in there
[15:32] and you you maybe not really understand
[15:34] what's being said and the the teachers
[15:37] up there writing on the chalkboard and
[15:39] you look over to your right and there's
[15:40] somebody with their head on the desk
[15:41] with slobber coming out of their mouth
[15:43] you know they're just sleeping you look
[15:46] over to the other side and they're
[15:47] snoozing and they're just not getting it
[15:50] cuz it's just it's just education and
[15:52] they're not really they hadn't really
[15:54] got the vision of what it is they're
[15:56] just they're just there and they're
[15:57] looking up at the clock waiting for the
[15:59] Bell to ring now now y'all know y'all
[16:01] know just as well as I we've all been
[16:03] there where we're waiting for the Bell
[16:05] to
[16:06] ring you're sitting up in class I I hope
[16:09] that they're serving my favorite I hope
[16:11] I hope they're serving that good School
[16:12] lunchroom pizza today or whatever and
[16:15] you're waiting on the bail to ring now
[16:17] now the same thing happens in church
[16:19] though it's you come to church and
[16:21] you're not really getting it and and
[16:23] that's in school you fall asleep because
[16:25] you're you're not really enthused about
[16:27] it and here in church you you come to
[16:29] church and you start falling asleep cuz
[16:31] you don't really know what's being
[16:32] explained and you're not really you're
[16:34] not really you you it's just a bunch of
[16:37] symbols and algebra and things and maybe
[16:40] like in school the drool will be coming
[16:42] out of somebody's mouth next to you or
[16:44] here in church the same similar kind
[16:47] kind of thing can be happening but and
[16:49] and it all becomes just education it's
[16:51] just you're sitting there and you're
[16:53] waiting for the bail to ring and that's
[16:55] why brother Ram said what we need is not
[16:57] education we need the power and
[17:00] demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in
[17:02] the church to demonstrate the power
[17:04] Jesus never said go into all the world
[17:06] and teach he never said go into all the
[17:09] he said go into all the world and preach
[17:11] the gospel and the gospel is to
[17:14] demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost
[17:16] the resurrection now you see when he
[17:18] says that it can be confusing because
[17:19] he's not saying we don't need teaching
[17:22] he's saying we don't need education he's
[17:24] saying we need we need inspired
[17:26] preaching of the Gospel to actually
[17:28] demonstrate it and make it real because
[17:30] that is how you'll see your calling that
[17:33] you're just not educated into it it's
[17:35] not just something where you gather to
[17:37] watch the to wait for the Bell to ring
[17:39] but it's a actually a supernatural
[17:41] calling where God is dealing with hearts
[17:44] and drawing people to himself now
[17:47] brother he would say in Israel and the
[17:48] church in 1953 he said every one of you
[17:51] that held your hand you've been
[17:53] listening in these meetings no one in
[17:56] here could come to Jesus except God God
[17:59] draws him what's doing
[18:01] that what's making that
[18:06] desire God is here God is here now that
[18:11] that's why Paul would say in that next
[18:12] chapter chapter two that I come not to
[18:15] you with enticing words but in the power
[18:17] and administration because the
[18:19] atmosphere of a holy ghost filled church
[18:21] service will bring to people's awareness
[18:24] that God is there and he said what's
[18:26] doing it what's making that desire God
[18:29] begins to draw and begins to pull at the
[18:31] people in the authority of the word he
[18:33] said you can only preach the gospel and
[18:36] let those who will come and no man can
[18:40] come unless God draws
[18:42] him so it all belongs to God and if God
[18:46] has called you and give you a call to
[18:47] come to him you should be very very
[18:53] happy why should you be happy cuz
[18:56] there's that promise in Matthew Chapter
[18:58] 5 that said blessed are they which do
[19:00] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[19:03] for they shall be filled if you got a
[19:06] desire in your heart and I we I say this
[19:09] because I feel like this in this hour
[19:11] that we're living in it's creeping up on
[19:14] the church World until people just don't
[19:15] really care anymore you can actually see
[19:17] well years ago uh you know when the Lord
[19:20] was dealing with me it seems like
[19:22] everybody the the Lord was dealing with
[19:24] everybody but but now it's gotten to
[19:26] where people have just grown wax colder
[19:29] and colder until they just they're not
[19:30] really hungering or thirsting they there
[19:33] and so that's why Jesus actually said
[19:35] you're blessed you're blessed to to want
[19:38] it you're blessed to to something you
[19:40] know I remember sitting in church and
[19:43] and just want wanting so bad to know for
[19:46] sure whether where I was right
[19:48] positionally and just have that hunger
[19:51] and craving to to to to know if things
[19:53] were right in my life and so you you
[19:56] know back then you you look at you think
[19:59] well there's something wrong with me but
[20:01] actually there's something right there's
[20:03] something right if you if you want God
[20:05] so much until you're ready to pray all
[20:08] night until you're ready to get get
[20:10] alone with god with your Bible there's
[20:13] something right with you if you want God
[20:16] so bad you're willing to do anything to
[20:18] get it and there's something wrong if
[20:21] we've gotten so cold and so far away
[20:23] until church just becomes an education
[20:26] thing where we're just watching for the
[20:27] clock to be filled but the thing is we
[20:30] can't make you be different I can't I
[20:32] can't make myself be different it's got
[20:34] to be God that can move on the scene and
[20:37] call and draw and all we do like this
[20:40] quote that I'm just reading here that
[20:41] you can only preach the gospel and let
[20:44] those who will
[20:46] come now you you think about what a what
[20:48] an amazing thing that is that you preach
[20:52] the gospel and then God goes to work and
[20:55] you can't give the ministry any credit
[20:57] you can't give your yourself any credit
[21:00] you can't give your mama and your daddy
[21:01] any credit can't give the deacons any
[21:03] credit it's all God that's what that's
[21:07] what that's what Paul is telling us that
[21:09] no flesh can Glory because it's all God
[21:13] you can't call yourself you can't draw
[21:15] yourself you can't give yourself a gift
[21:17] it's all God but when the gospel goes to
[21:20] be preaching and the power and and
[21:23] demonstration it will it will do what it
[21:25] says it will do brother R will say you
[21:28] can't come there is no need of trying to
[21:30] do anything unless God draws
[21:33] you when God draws you then you'll
[21:36] come and he that comes to me I will know
[21:39] in no wise cast
[21:41] out now now that's powerful right there
[21:45] that when you start feeling that
[21:46] pulsating in your
[21:47] heart and you know that it's God calling
[21:51] you he promised that I will not cast you
[21:55] out if it's God pulling you
[21:59] and it ain't just the minister trying to
[22:00] scare you or something but it's God
[22:03] actually drawing you he ain't going to
[22:05] cast you out amen he said God has to do
[22:08] it it takes the work of the Holy Spirit
[22:11] to even turn your
[22:13] heart takes
[22:15] God someone said I sought God and sought
[22:18] God no no no God sought you not you
[22:22] seeking God God seeks you just like he
[22:27] sought Adam the very first one he sought
[22:30] Adam Where Art Thou he's still seeking
[22:33] people so salvation is not something
[22:37] Humanity achieves or initiates
[22:39] independently it begins with God's call
[22:42] drawing individuals to himself and the
[22:45] call is a desire to be saved that
[22:48] demonstrates that God is already at work
[22:51] in that individual's heart it's that
[22:53] little pulsating down in your heart that
[22:55] says I I need something
[22:58] God begins to work and begins to move in
[23:01] 2 Timothy chapter 1
[23:03] ver9 and we'll be closing here in just a
[23:06] second Paul said Paul told Timothy who
[23:09] hath saved us and called us with an holy
[23:13] calling not according to our works but
[23:15] according to his own purpose and Grace
[23:18] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[23:21] before the world
[23:24] began so he's laying out it's not by
[23:27] your own works
[23:29] but there's a purpose it's his grace to
[23:31] us and it was all planned out before the
[23:33] world even began and that's where your
[23:36] calling starts now that's why that's
[23:38] such a powerful statement you see your
[23:39] calling Brethren if you really see your
[23:41] calling that you know what God has given
[23:44] you was the same thing that he thought
[23:46] of before the foundation of the world in
[23:48] Isaiah 46 remember the former things of
[23:51] old for I am God and there is none else
[23:53] I am God and there is none like me
[23:55] declaring the end from the beginning and
[23:57] from ancient times the things that are
[23:58] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[24:00] stand and I will do my I will do all my
[24:05] pleasure that the word you hear the
[24:08] calling is actually bringing you back to
[24:11] what was yours to begin with but the
[24:13] call and we'll close on this in just a
[24:15] moment is without force or coercion and
[24:19] Jehovah Gyra brother Bram said you
[24:20] believe that the Holy
[24:22] Spirit through this week has proved that
[24:25] he speaks here he asked everybody raise
[24:28] our hands he said there should be this
[24:31] many more or more I feel that
[24:34] feeling there's something wrong yet
[24:37] better come and he said remember I can't
[24:40] force you to come against your own will
[24:45] it's not by force or coercion but it's
[24:48] by that gospel call and glorify Jesus he
[24:50] said you can't desire that God has to
[24:53] make it come to you just think someone
[24:56] setting the holy spirit says this is
[24:59] your time to put up your hand and then
[25:02] you would reject it see that's the Holy
[25:06] Spirit Jesus said no man can come to me
[25:09] unless the father draws him at all what
[25:12] is drawing knocking at your door saying
[25:16] this is
[25:18] it this is it raise your hand now and
[25:24] say oh to think about what a profound
[25:27] thing that God could be knock knocking
[25:28] at somebody's heart to identify with
[25:30] them the present tense word for the day
[25:33] knocking at their heart saying this is
[25:35] it and that's the sign of this end time
[25:37] that in this day the leot Ayan church
[25:40] that God will be put out of the of the
[25:43] church knocking on the door on the
[25:45] outside and and and and and nobody
[25:48] hardly barely anybody will open the door
[25:52] as it was in the days of Noah as it was
[25:55] in the days of lot and so forth so few
[25:58] would actually open up that door till
[26:01] even Jesus would ask that question will
[26:03] I find faith when the son of man
[26:06] returns and we'll just stop there let's
[26:09] bow our heads Lord God we're so grateful
[26:10] Lord that you you've given what the
[26:13] world calls foolish and and just
[26:15] simplistic things Lord to save our
[26:18] simple Humble Hearts and change us Lord
[26:21] to make us conform to the word and I I
[26:23] thank you Lord God that you've given us
[26:25] the ability to be able to see our
[26:26] calling and recognize that we're you've
[26:28] made us different from the world you've
[26:31] set us apart Lord God and we know where
[26:33] we come from and where we're going Lord
[26:36] Jesus I pray God that you'll just Lord
[26:38] we we've got so many things to be
[26:39] thankful for Lord God and I pray Lord
[26:41] that you'll be with us for the remainder
[26:42] of the day the remainder of this service
[26:45] Lord Jesus just bless your people keep
[26:47] us now we pray in your name amen God
[26:50] bless you Saints
[26:54] [Applause]
