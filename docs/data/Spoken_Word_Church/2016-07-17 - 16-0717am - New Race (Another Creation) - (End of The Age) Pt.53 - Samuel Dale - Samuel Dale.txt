scripture today not that we're getting away from the stature of a perfect man cuz we'll still be dealing with it but we're going to go to Malachi 4 and read verse 5 and 6 and we had a good time at the fellowship meeting there yesterday and I think they calculated it was somewhere around 40 of us that was there so we we had a good representation and had a good time it was really a good time in the Lord and the next fellowship meeting will be at brother lores and that will be what uh July August September then the next one will be at uh brother Tom I mean brother Tony's on in November so I'm sure it'll probably work around for us to be about January of next year so we getting everything scheduled for doing but amen hope you you that went had a good time because we did we enjoyed the fellowship together and everything around the word of the Lord just remember the announcements now for the coming Services the end end of this month 31st will'll be brother Royo Serano will be with us

off the road and run down the side and done some things but uh they took him to the hospital everything was okay he said he that they told him it was probably the medication that caused him to just have a temporary blackout and all like that but just keep him in your prayers that the Lord would would reach down touch him because you know we need him and everything else so remember that any other announcements I I know the other announcements has been made about the different meetings and all and just just pray the Lord would bless okay anything else brother Spen word request list last night and uh that's why Gary's not here cuz he's actually having to help her up by the bed yeah right right remember Sister Julie is having in a lot of trouble with her back so you that have had back trouble remember that okay all right father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord we thank you that you are God and you change not and that way we can depend upon Lord what we ask you we know that you will fulfill it because you've always done it down through time and there would be no reason to think you wouldn't come and do now so we pray that you would just bless each one and guide each and every one of us remember the sick among us remember Sister Julie there in her back of hurting Lord be with her brother forny touch him be all with all the other ones that are sick among us CU you

we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives that we may walk in you we love you in Jesus name amen Revelations 3 and then Malachi four and unto the angel of the Church of the lady oans write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness who is he the beginning of the creation of God all right now then we go over to Malachi 4 very familiar scriptures with all of us uh while you're getting there we'll read verse 4 remember ye the law of Moses now why would he sum up all things of the Old Testament and then speak of the coming in of the New Testament you know or the Elijah with this kind of a statement because remember by now all the word that has been written was written not just Ten Commandments the word of God so watch what he said remember and I wrote it like this in my my Bible years ago when coming to the end of all the Old Testament he says consider all the word all right then what does he say remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horb for all Israel with his statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now the uh I'm sure you'll probably hear things maybe more but according to what we've heard off the internet system that Russia is in the process of taking away religious freedom from the people of Russia so you know that's coming to P CU remember brother BR said watch Russia why not we got to watch the Catholics we know that that's the part that hinders us but watch Russia because you see what's happening as you're coming down and we heard that yesterday that they were going to take away the religious freedom and see that's all it takes is an act or a pen or whatever to do to change uh I hope you would catch the idea I'm not a doomsday guy I'm a minister but I wish you would understand my point about it you seen like turkey where they uh had a coupe and it didn't work cuz they caught on you know well see that's all it would take here you so can't happen in America go ahead and sleep you you you're you're saying you know you can say well you know our money is going to be taken away no mine won't well even if you got it in your pocket what good is it when it when you have a coupe do you realize what happens your government is gone that could be overnight church but that's not to try to scare you it's to try to instruct that we be ready and against the day that you you and I are living by what by the opening of God's word to you and I it's not what Russia is doing China's doing whatever is doing uh all of that it's what you and I are doing in Christ all right now we read in Malachi 4 we'll get back to that in a minute more but just remember we're still dealing with the stature of a perfect man and I told you Wednesday what I was doing and you know for you uh that was here I will make the point of what I'm doing because the next few messages we have a little title but we've got a third title to the message and we're really talking about the breach between or the uh you know the Gap as we'll get to it later and call it the lap over and the things and uh doing and showing the point that uh to have a gap between something is great to be able to see it but remember we want something to be built through that you know in that to get over what good is having it you know a road running up to a a lake and you know or a river and you say oh we've got a road up to there what good is it if you can't continue on so then there's got to be something that we're dealing with and I'm trying to get the point to for you to look at it that we're not trying to do away but we're and we're not just trying to build in these sides we're trying to tie these together together in the bases that you don't have to move it and just let this day and the hour be what it is all right because to me it reveals great things all right now we we're dealing in the stature of a perfect man and we went through some services and we went through it this past Wednesday covering a lot about it that how that the prophet says the messenger comes where at the End of the Age all right it's all always at that point see he rebukes prior to him and then he brings his message to his people all right you say well that's well Paul come at the End of the Age so he come over there at the end is winding down of Ephesus where would you get that from how could he bring the message to Ephesus now don't get tied up in those Church ages and things of trying to figure out there is actually one of those men that was not even born in the age that brother brandham puts him as to be the messenger of there's actually one of them that is not D some of them were at the middle age this age or that age but remember what your Prophet said I've got it here if they want to pull it up it's on the list but remember what he said oh you'll have to flop all the way over to the LI because it's the Ephesian Church age and he says it this away now what was the let's let's get this one first uh Ephesian Church age paragraph 76 all right we've got it see it now watch I quoted this to you the other night but I want to read it and then we'll read it again this evening to tie in together but watch at the end of the giving of the Revelation according to tradition Paul had already died a martyr watch it but John was carrying on in his stad exactly as Paul had done in the days of his ministry the death of Paul before the Revelation was given before they went to patmas 95 once does not at all an know the fact that he was the messenger to the Ephesian Church age watch him for the messenger to every age regardless of when he appears or goes is the man who influences that age for God by means of a word manifested ministry Paul was that man right now I tried to make a point the other night and I'll make it again to State it see I thought that brother brandham said it was the Holy Spirit that picked those Messengers that's right do you see how ignorant we are in what we do we could think we're great smart elic people to think well this man right here wouldn't even in the ages you know ages done gone and I thought your Prophet said the Holy Spirit picked it so back up to the paragraph 92 of the Ephesian Church all right now what was the spiritual climate of that age amen it had left its first love now watch we'll get back to this in the message why because Paul came at the end of the age end of what age well it came to end of Ephesus well then how could he bring the message to Ephesus no what's the prophet explaining what he came at we'll get back to that in a little bit it had left its first love is that the scripture that's Revelations 2 and 4 3 and 4 that's the message to the church age in Ephesus leaving the first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost all right living his first love was falling from Pentecost where did Paul where was he at and who was he rebuking that's all we read these things and then you keep that in mind as we're going along that we want to tie together this point until we can find the age we're living the message and how it ties in and you say well what has that got to do with us because it is this hour amen it is this day amen we must know the day we're living how can you know the day you're living if you don't know about the ages prior and what they were I'm talking about knowing in the Bible where you're at that's right I'm not talking about just oh we're in Lady of everybody preaches we in Lady of yeah oh yeah and it'll be around the world today everybody preaching about how that Russia is doing this and that of the other and they're coming after us next well that's all right that's all right that's well and good but what good does that do if we're not in the word right amen see go along with it if we're not in the word to understand what's going on and we'll think it's of God the biggest portion of the religious world is going to do that isn't it well what do you think makes us different well we got the Holy Ghost if we've got the Holy Ghost we'll be in the word for the age is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost the word of this age so we have to get to that point all right remember what we went through in the church ages we I mean in the Statue of a perfect man we saw that they were eight manifestations Faith virtue knowledge temper fa God in this brotherly kindness and love eight manifestations of God but there were only seven ads am the prophet said the age and The Messengers of the age and the I came up the same as the people did all right then we went in trying to get real quick now we went into talking about the church ages and how that there was seven Church ages seven angels but there were eight manifestations of God in those ages all right see then that goes to show you can look at the pyramid about your Messengers and showing that the messenger come at the End of the Age all right as he came at the End of the Age see he is to bring the truth for the age to you and I put brother Brandon back down there at the end of of uh Wesley's age he would be the messenger to Lady OA and he said he was not that he came at the End of the Age all right I'm trying to get you to see something history side of where we can take the prophet's message and bring out the things and see it l in to see where we're at to see where we're standing recognizing your day and his message what is the message of this day I thought that we were to believe that we were the Bride of Jesus Christ all right then we'll see in my point has been a couple of messages and still driving now from my heart to get you to see that it's always been the holy spirit in every age it's always been God Mankind in the AES that we live in and by doing that then every messenger would not be exactly like Paul but they're supposed to pattern after him and if the Holy Spirit picked those ages and wrote them in the Bible you know Ephesians all like that wrote that then you're PR by the same holy spirit that wrote about these ages all right see then we can run haywire and try to figure out this that or the other no just don't worry about it do what he said the Holy Spirit Pi the messenger of the age right because that was the one working for God during that age and no matter what are the time wise you know when I just can't see that because this there you go you don't have a revelation see you don't have a revelation and you're trying to figure out everything and get it to your own thinking all right but see remember this point the Holy Ghost always comes at the end End of the Age the reason it comes that way is to where there's got to be message stand between lady oia and Eternity right right I believe we've had that message I'm not looking for another Messenger to come hour and a half or something on the hour last night on the phone with a brother I think he was trying to present something and I'm just too dumb to fall after it so made a couple of quotes back to him and it's you know it's very easy if you're not trying to be sarcastic but when somebody's talking to you about something it's just just throw them a curve and see if they follow the curve if they don't then you know that it doesn't work too good but I'm not against anybody he was bringing out some good things but I want to know what he was talking about I'm not interested in all of these other things I'm interested in one thing you and I being ready against the day the age is fast coming to a close and if we're not ready then we'll be like the rest now what did I tell you 40 years ago that the biggest portion of these people of the message even borned again would die and go by the grave cuz they won't be able to stand the pressure of the hour they we're facing cuz remember it's got to come from within I ain't worried about the government passing laws I'm concerned about the preachers in the pull pit passing their ideas that's right more than laws you know and doing because that'll get to that point okay but listen what was we talking about Wednesday night when brother brandham says you'll see an age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself he said in the fullness of the baptism but yet there's a lot of people believe that ausus tree had nothing or give them a little bit but not like the book of Acts well I hope this this has called on to you to understand that I'm a firm believer as I said a moment ago that the Holy Ghost is in every age ate down not the Holy See then God can only work according to the amount of word that he has the ability to use so that's why he had to start with Luther and Wesley and Pentecost and remember those were reformers for not restoration amen you said well it was Resto yeah I've got yeah okay I have to Sure Luther was restoration if you'll take it to the just shall live by faith Wesley of sanctification was restoration but the people in time was Reformation yes amen cuz they were reforming all right and that's why it's the age that when you come to isusa Street see then the Holy Ghost came himself that was not my words that's brother Brown's words of questions and answers on the seals that we gave Wednesday night all right remember the messenger always comes at the End of the Age come at the beginning of the age and remember we gave you these about brother Bram and saying when did he start his message remember according to 327 Church age book this messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 dirty is going to do two things first the fathers two reveal the Thunders which is revelation containing the seven seal it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths he said that literally turn us back amen all right what have I said from the beginning the only way you'll get the virtues of the Statue of a perfect man is for the for God to unveil his word CU it's not an automatic ad just because it's you're this that or the other something you amen is Jesus Christ amen in the hour that you and I are living that's right all right see if we believe we're in the last days right then we ought to believe that everything's coming to an end amen right well you know what if everything's coming to an end why can't we see what happen at there because to me way he said to biggest portion of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the last few hours of Calvary right you know fulfill the last few hours well can't we see that in this age is to wind up everything right and you remember I mean you mean to tell me that we're in an age that has wind up everything well yeah we we make it to church yeah know I just I just can't do this can't do we just barely can survive you wouldn't listening the other night when I was giving the quotes from The Prophet when he said what he said the same Spirit of those people that gave their lives down to those Dark Ages is the same Holy Spirit we use daily to just overcome that's right why shouldn't we be the happiest people and more concerned with studying the message of the hour to be prepared against the day that we're living when we know this is the greatest it has ever been well I just don't see nothing Well the reason you don't see it cuz you don't have inside of you the one to see it with that plain enough are you telling me I'm lost no you told me is lost right see don't throw it at me I'll just give it back to you you tell me that I don't see nothing well then if you don't see nothing that means you can't see it because the Bible says it's happening right the Bible says we're in the end the Bible says that this is the greatest age it has ever been when others don't see nothing well then that means you can't got the one inside to see with so you need to get born again that's right I've told you over and over how many times you ever heard this statement well brother random didn't say that he said he'll take them seven unknown Thunders to wake her up back in the bride he said ain't never had a Revival that's right that's right we'll get to it this evening where the messenger of the age and the bride age and the things right because we believe it but see I've been in a Revival ever since I've been in this message Revival to me is not the shouting GL Hallelujah things that you think of a Revival that's right you think it's a Revival that's why I asking you Wednesday night you know when you say holy spirit when you say headstone Capstone whatever what do you think about I thought the Holy Spirit was the word in Spirit made one that's right cuz if it's not you just got the anointing that's right ones but if it's the word and spirit as one together you have the alive word of God sure I'd love to have men alive what's in my brain right but there's one thing about it there is some things that was in my brain that are now in my heart right that's right cuz I'm not going to reject what's here well I just don't see it like that look around the world right they had it on the phone there a while ago where a certain brother I won't call their name whatever was talking about a little girl that she' lost her hire and everything and they prayed and God restored it a lay man I believe that but you know what we've got a little girl sitting back there that when she was four years old three four years old two years old her hair started falling out so much until at 2 years old she become concerned you know what we prayed about it right how many of you remember that we prayed about it and you going to look at her high now she sits down on it see why don't we believe God is with us what do we need well I'd like to see it this way like see it that way like I've told you and I know you don't like it but I'd like for you to do it I want you to read the book of Acts and write down the accounts in the book of Acts of the Holy Spirit and what it done now I know I got sense I know the Bible said all the things were not written right but here comes a prophet to say what he said more in one service than the book of Acts cuz if you counted the the great Miracles and happening in the book of Acts you only have maybe 10 15 20 things how many things has been Among Us that we've seen from the dead raised to the sick healed to to the things amen right all right we see we say we don't see nothing well you can't see because you're blind but listen what did we talk about Wednesday night when did Brother Brandon's message actually begin he said well he begun back there in 1947 right that's you're okay but because that's part of connecting but remember Malachi 4 is to do two things that's right number one we read in the Bible that he would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children all right now back there it came forth but what is that really speaking of the hearts of the fathers to the children it was the new message right faith of the fathers hearts are the Old Testament fathers to the New Testament message right but you know now the Life part of that is to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers why would it be saiding it that way cuz it's showing you that it's going to fall away down Through the Ages the faith of the fathers the revelation of the Apostles was lost during the in those ages right and it come out with Luther of the just shall live by faith see all right see then this messenger is going to restore the faith of the fathers I'm not the one that wrote it in the book he said he preached 33 years before he could preach statue of perfect man statue of perfect man was written in the Bible Peter talked about the statute of perfect man written in the Bible right but yet it took a prophet 30 something years before he could bring what he saw that's right so what's he talking about it took him all of that time to try to get us back to the faith of the fathers see then his message would come right so then it would be like like he says on trying to do God a service we use Wednesday paragraph 10 uh 165 goes on to one one yeah 165 let's just read it I want you to see the truth of what I'm talking about and believe in it trying to do God a service without being his will paragraph 165 through 166 goes into to the bottom he says not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message is that scripture Revelation 10:7 says what the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound he begin to sound his message see where did he where is his message all right go to the Rapture paragraph 1 uh8 and in the seventh Angel's message while he was making his Proclamation his ministry then when he be to sound forth his ministry not when he started out now what does he compare it with Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and thing oh he was a great prophet but when he be to say I my father one was used to do restoration why because it took a prophet that's it that's what I've always tried to get you to see Peter and them had the message that's what they tried to tell the people how to get where they were but when the the message was lost of that you know the word be to to be taken away down to the ages until you come to a dark ages of almost nothing scripturally we would talk about and here comes Luther with the message of you shall live by faith amen ordained of God to fall at the right time to be at that why because that would that's what it would be see the messenger then would come at the end of the age and he would bring that message to the people [Music] because see that would be the lineup of God that would be the way God would ordain it to be see Luther never came out preaching the statue of a perfect man yet he probably preached messages on second Peter is what I said they they didn't understand the seals and the thing but yet Luther probably preach commentaries if you could find it messages about the seals and the things right but it was not the age to come forth it was not the time for God to reveal it that's right so then what would be this last day message what I was trying my best to get you to see I'm keep on trying to here that when that message came you realize now whether you like it or what you realize that God not kept his word and sent a prophet to this age they would no way ever could have been a Rapture there would have been a running out of time and everything and that was not ordained in God's word so you mean a Rapture a change of people only if it's only [Music] two right or one or you realize as the brother was bringing light not about Enoch walk with God and I knew that scripture there and you know but he asked the question or didn't ask the question but he told it the only two people that's ever said that they walk with God was Enoch and who who was the other one Noah we talk about Enoch going up wonderful what he tyed but what about Noah going up riding over and coming back down which was just as much a typ and the Bible says Noah walked with God see the emphasis is laid upon what he's using it for you you realize that that say like uh to show you an example the the Bible speaking of John the Baptist the prophet would speak of him being full of the Holy Ghost from his mother's Wom the Bible says you know 6 months and he jumped and was moving and said he was fil you ever notice the other scriptures about Mary being full of the Holy Ghost about Martha being full of the Holy Ghost about all these people but see it's the emphasis you're making upon the situation right right the others that would be say full of the Holy Ghost would not be counted like John to come forth with that situation or Enoch to walk off the earth but see it says of Noah that he walked with God see we don't read the Bible to have an understanding we just do what we want to with it but listen the prophet said this message he said 62 he he said could not have been preached 40 years ago right you realize 40 years from 62 put in 42 right is that mathematically which would have been 42 excuse me 22 let me get my numbers right you say well no he couldn't have come cuz he wouldn't die no they would was no situation he says it there I gave you the quote what knowing all alone the message was coming I remember one brother said brother Brown told him he knew that he was to be the Malachi 4 and the brother says and I heard him say it he said well why don't you just go Proclaim it he said you can't do that brother Ram didn't jump out there proclaiming who he was he let God prove who he was then he solved the whole problem all right but are you following me see when the messenger comes at the end of the age it's got a reason for coming there now I've told you from the very beginning of I preached this 40 years ago I believe that The Headstone to the message is brother Brown's message I mean The Headstone to the bride is brother Brown's message what else are you going to make it see you want it some great anointing or some great see that's all you think about headstone if the headstone is the Cornerstone then the Cornerstone was a revelation of Jesus Christ am what would be the headstone didn't say it said it's revelation of supreme deity what are you following me now have you been listening to what I've been doing cuz like I said I'm I'm talking about filling this in not to put aide in or do that no but filling in to where that you have no Gap between the body of Jesus Christ and The Headstone you don't lower it down just leave it alone bring the message and let the message just fill it in if you don't believe Red's message was a headstone what do you believe the headstone is going to be right you don't realize you're looking for another messenger see his message was the word when are we going to realize that it wasn't just signs and wonders that's always been in the word of God right the Bible is full of signs and wonders but anointed ones can do signs and wonders but they can't bring a message oh they got their own message you know what I'm talking about you know the one we even gave there was it Wednesday or last Sunday where brother Bron said if it comes forth with signs and wonders and stays in that same old organization see that's why I've never been concerned see I know that these things happened I know that even after brother bradam passed away that there were certain people went to a certain brother that had signs and wonders I ain't calling no names I'm just saying it because they was checking out to see what was he checking out to see see if he was the messenger to take over I guess what else would you go there for but see we done told what we''re done told it don't matter if the signs and wonders comes and they stay with the same message of the ages and things before that has brought forth you know not the truth of it the denomination on said don't believe it that's right I thought we believe where the scripture said we bringing out the other day about that scripture where he said if a if a if a man comes and a Prophet come and he gives you a sign and it comes to that's right oh if it com to we got to believe it no that scripture doesn't say that that's another scripture those two can't be fighting each other right it said if he takes you to another God don't believe him why he said because I send him among you to try you right we don't like that do we we don't think God would do something like that I like the way brother Ram says things and a lot of times it's humorous and a lot of times it's not too humorous but he said God wanted to make sure that he had the right man and Moses before he got down there you know to the Dead Sea or the sea you know now God wanted to make sure now that's yes but you know what you know what God wanted to make sure you what God knows all things when these days I'm going to preach on that when he days I want to preach on does God know everything well yeah he does well how come my sins can go that way into the sea of forgetfulness and he can never remember them then does he know everything like we think about it you know we might find out one of these days the prophet was right when he said that said he want to make sure he had the right man now we hold it and right it is good Moses was really the one he's working on to make sure that he understood okay we go along with that but still remember the rest of it see this message church has brought to you and I why is it that people don't want to study it we've had 50 years since the going of the Prophet why is it that we don't want to this become engu in what is said instead of trying to still figure it out or argue with it you mean this would not be the most important of all ages when everything the Bible said is waiting what on us but what about it Church what about it can you see that the prophet's message where it came out see that's why in the Years prior now I'm not one of these oh he was wrong here he was right here brother brandham was right if it wasn't he corrected is wrong he was the one that done it all right remember even after the seals broke brother brandham made some mistakes in his speech and connections of things which you take you got to say the message was right come on folks he didn't do it until he got on over our later you know that brother randam was teaching 14 I mean teaching uh 14 seals 14 bindings 12 of seven on the outside the book seven on the inside the book until about 64 65 that's what he said he said I believe there were seven on the inside seven on the outside why because he was a human that's why I've always said the messenger the man was not infallible but the message he brought right is infallible amen right there's where we stand what we stand here as people you realize that I don't know why I got on to this I don't drop my notes I'll preach this evening on that you realize that you and I are standing where no one has ever stood we're standing between Mortal life you know living and even with the new birth and coming down all that's wonderful with the soul being Eternal but we're standing in a place if this message is not the message to change these bodies we better find another one right but you see I just ain't been able to find nothing else to tie together any thoughts about it right then you know I don't go after the signs and the Wonders and all these other things cuz you'd be going after some of these guys that you know has got things that happen but see I remember a statement brother Brandon says they didn't come with the message signs and wonders but without a message yep signs and wonders followed this man's Ministry that we talk about with a message followed a message to change you and I from Mortal to immortality or else we better start searching for another messenger well that's what I'm trying my best to preach to you whether you understand it or not talking about the messenger coming at the End of the Age there's not no brother random I got the quotes here where he says that cannot be another age right why who gave him the authority to say that when it can't be another age well we need this Eighth Day guy we need that farun around done preach today right that's what a brother said at my house talking about you you know oh yeah we do this right the other I said why don't you guys tell us something Beyond brother Bram I said he's already preached us to the Future home right he was in my home and asked the question I figured I had a right to answer it I said why don't y'all tell us beyond the future home if y'all are to take over but see the prophet said there's not another age amen it goes from this age of the seven what I've tried to get you to see mathematically the seventh Church age now I'll give you quotes either way you want it the seventh Church Age The Prophet says ends in the Rapture the bride now he'll make that statement but then he'll cover the seventh Church age going all the way through on a seven through the Millennium because it's still a seven right there's time still in the Millennium it's under a number seven but you see if we don't strike a number eight we don't have any hopes you know what comes after the Millennium do you know the order what comes after the millennium the watch your own judgment you want to go there come on I can show you where the Prophet lays it out and Order and Order and order coming down what's the next thing Rapture he said while the tribulation I'm quoting him is setting up in upon you and I for rejecting the message he said Israel is receiving their message he said then tribulation strikes Israel he said the next is a millennium the next is the white Throne he said then you I mean excuse me yeah the white Throne he said then the next is the future home well then it's this message to take you and I into eternal life and that's exactly scriptural what I was trying to bring the other night I what showing it amen that this man stood to bring you and I a message that's scripture right that's where he was telling you to go back in your scripture according Leviticus he said 258 that's 77 is 49 mhm the messenger in the seventh Church age is to proclaim a 50 to be coming if we don't reach a 50 somewhere physically world and everything then we've stopped the Bible right but yeah we got but we just go we just go yeah but see this man that brought the message we don't put that on the man it's not that it's the message that he brought us that's right he's carried us all the way to the Future home what is beyond there there is nothing beyond the future home that's a summing up of all things that's right I sure hope to goodness he don't let it start back over that's silly anyway but I sure hope you don't let it start back over because we don't want more to go over but it wouldn't work so this prophet's message is come to bring you and I eternal life in these flesh well why wouldn't we want to study the message why wouldn't we not want to Devour the message is that not in Revelation where he was told to take the book to not just take the book take the book and eat the book right am why would we have any other thoughts about anything else other than we've got a message and we've got it laid into our lap so where we can study anything we want to on it through the computers and the things right why would we not want to study that message and know the message to the to the letter A man told Brother mo one time brother Mo said something about getting the the tapes and giving them to the people to this certain brother the brother said you don't need to do that said them people know just as much about the message as you do well that's so I love to preach to people amen that know what he said that's right cuz see if you know what he said and I say it that way you're not trying to figure out whether he said it or not that's right but I do a lot of reading to make sure you understand he said it right it's not my idea or my thoughts is what he says L also said this come on I'll talk with any of you anytime on your allos right right but just remember we're going to come back to the na the also show we're going to come back to what he said right and we're going to come back with it in the right order right we're going to come back with it like Matthew 28:19 saying the same thing as acts 238 right right right it's not one saying one thing you never heard the people of the message years ago they said that you know what they said we take acts 238 for our baptism the denominations takes Matthew 28:19 for their I said no way I said if they'd take Matthew 28:19 for their baptism I'll be glad to go along with them because it plainly tells you it is the Lord Jesus Christ Father Son and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ so you see that's why people don't want to talk but the age that you and I are living in see it's this message that will change our bodies well how come you don't know this message verbatim how come you don't spend your time listening to this message reading you know we listen to T that which way you want to go don't get all tied up with me how come you don't know you know it's a shame now listen it's a shame after all of these years that you got to say and read that brother rown said it it's a shame do you mean that I've got to prove that there's one God I thought that we believe they wouldn't but one God I thought we believe they wouldn't but one Holy Ghost I thought we believe they wouldn't but one truth One Faith one Lord one baptism and I've got to prove to you there one God you know the reason I have to do that cuz there's so many proving it contrary amen but that's a shame I don't have no problems with you saying brother Dale where did he say that at if I quote you something I don't have no problem cuz I'll find it you know you ever thought about using gifs in a way of understanding a lot you know that I was sitting there the other night and I knew that I had made a statement to uh say that uh brother Brandon we were talking about the messengers and the thing and that brother bandam had said that it that you know it's not the time or the thing but it's the man who is the most prevalent for the age it's not whether he comes at but he's the messenger to the age chosen by the Holy Spirit I knew that quote was there and I sat there and I thought how can I get it I ran it this way I ran it that way I ran it this way after a while I sat there and I said yeah I know let's see that quote is and I just typ the words in and there it come up we should have a memory of the things of the message is my point I used to go to brother Mo and I'd say brother Mo what is uh where's the scripture that says so and so well he just right I come on folks I have trouble spelling let Al on anything else you ever looked up something in the computer and you spell it wrong first time we hooked up the computer first time I got a hold of it me and Anna was doing it she was putting it in for me and doing cuz I didn't know how to do it and that was the old days you had to put them in took you two days to get it all to come in you know and uh so we got it all done and uh she said well we run a run a check now I said okay let's let's do this let's just see and I put tapped in what I thought was serpant how do you spell it s e r p e n t and I put a n because that's what it sounds like don't it and it come up with a big old Z zero y I said I spent $3,500 and we spent two days running this sucker in and that dummy don't know what I know I know brother brandham said serpent thousands of thousands of times and I said Daddy resell it right you know see if it hadn't I'd have went away probably just trying to send a sucker back where I got it from but listen Church see we don't have to look for something else that's right you don't get nothing out of the message you didn't get nothing Wednesday night don't and don't get nothing they get one thing we don't have to depend on something else we depend upon the holy spirit I've got my book setting brother Mo taught it years ago he had every book we'd carry them in the back of his car and he had every one of them sitting in volumes and I said okay that's the way to do it my mes all of my books are sitting in volumes and all I got to do is take that little old blue greenish looking now book and there it says so and so there it is I go there it is you know I still use them a lot you know a lot of times when I have a question about what brother around say I know I can find it in those books right well I can find in the computer go ahead you take you days but I just have think well brother around said that home future home yep and I just pulled the book out and and there it is underline or most of the time wrote up on the front of it if you seen any of my books what are you getting that I'm getting it one thing I thought we had one message right I thought we had one Messenger to bring us one message I thought that was the order of God's word right to go to the message for the answer cuz the messenger came exactly the way it's supposed to I gave you the quotes where he said this one would stand where between lady osia and Eternity yep first service I preached right here in this building going Beyond man's count that was the first service in 1971 going Beyond man's Camp what you know the Bible speaks of him being outside the gate and it's you're and I are got to go out to where he's at now let him come where we at no we all tried that didn't we we all tried staying in them denominations and the churches we was in and tried to help the people didn't we which is good that's fine but you don't realizing all the whole time it wasn't there right we got to go where he's at see there's not another message to take you and I to eternal life that's right it's either in this prophet's message or we missed the whole time you say well that's putting too much on the man well if you're listening like that you're in bad shape cuz I put every bit of my emphasis on almighty God right almighty God promised to send you and I a messenger in this age and he sent it well you mean all them denominations are wrong if they turn down the word they wrong that's right I like brother Wood's way of saying it he said if my mother is a liar he said that years ago he said you know what said she ain't no difference than any other liar I don't want you tell my mother if your mother's a liar ain't no difference no other a liar what's the difference God is your mother we all love our parents right that's right what if brother Brandon would stayed with his mother when his mother used to tell him about serpent seeds and something like didn't believe and all that stuff when he would come out and started preaching you know she didn't in which you used to tell him that hell was eternal you think she didn't tell him a lot them things he must have he he talked about it but listen when we talk about the messenger coming at the end of the AG now watch it watch your seed and we'll pick it up that means that you got a certain place to put something now my wife is real good at it she's got a place for everything and that's well and good until she gets into my place and she thinks it all ought to be this way and I go looking for it and can't find it cuz it ain't in the place I left it I'm not saying she's wrong I'm saying we just need or reorganizing you know to get everything straight but you see the message is already been brought it's in place what are you and I waiting on that's right I've been playing from day one whatever you're looking forward to out there on the Internet or sitting in here wherever whatever you're looking forward to or think it's got to come remember there's got to be an order before it can come right I can quote scripture you know the children of Israel had to be crying for a deliverer before the deliverer was sent what caused the deliverer to be sent well then getting in this message and getting everything set in order of understanding is a preparation for anything else you could think about that would come that's right that's all I've ever tried to do get us ready then whatever God wants to send he can send it but if we ain't ready where we're going to be that's right amen well how do you get ready getting in the message getting in the Statue of a perfect man and study it to see if we have those virtues if not we'll to work on that right getting into the point of recognizing who we are and what we're doing that's right in the hour that we're living upon the Earth okay yeah see they can't be no more ages and we've got to admit we're at the End of the Age amen irregardless of anything you want to talk about or whatever you want to make we've got to admit We're In the End of the Age amen then according to the prophet God's waiting on you and I is that his words come on we'll get under the message later I got to laying on the Des what there's got to be a Ministry of Jesus Christ on the earth before he'll come back yeah I believe we're looking at the ministry of Jesus Christ go may I say one more thing before closing what we're looking for a lot of times what was it brother Joe was just quoting this morning me and him was talking when you think you got everything figured out just remember you don't have it figured out that's right that's the best way to say it right when you think you got it figured out you know God just does his way and he you know he don't call us up and ask us is it all right to do it he just does it his way and we say well this is figured out well that's that's okay we say it can't be no other way whether you better be standing in the right place when you say it can't be no other way why can't we at least stand on that of the message it can't be no other way of another Messenger to come that's right right it can't be another Messenger to come how long would it take him to go back and preach to these people I me talking about another Messenger to come an eighth day messenger or some kind of a guy that's got how long would it take for him to preach the truth right you you see because your messenger the only thing that he does is he points you to Christ he can't be your Christ amen right may I quote a man was listening to the other day many of May heard I I don't remember the wording but I mean the man's name but he said that uh he said I he was a great F brother R was talking about he said a great friend friend of or Roberts he said I thought if I ever get sick I'll just go to Old Robert and he'll pray for me he said so I ain't going to worry about it he said get sick I go to him he pray and God heal him he said one day he got sick he know well I'll just go to or Robert he goes to or Roberts he prays for him he said he got the feeling better he said okay praise God got it he said a day or so later or something he said he's sick again you may remember the story he goes back to brother Roberts he prayed and he said feel and there to ladies right back and said brother Robert said what you need to do is go to brother brandom and find out something's wrong here so you need to go find out brother brandom said he sat down with a man and went through everything he said I couldn't find no way to tell him what he needed to do he said I couldn't find anything find something to that paraphrase it but he couldn't find anything any answer from God he said the man got worse and worse and worse the man said well what am I going to do I've been to or Robert I've been to brother brandom said What Can I Do Lord said finally he just stopped and he said Lord I just need to turn to you he said he got healed cuz you see God was letting him know what he had too much emphasis upon the man of or Roberts and Billy Graham he needed his emphasis on him all that other was well and good but it won't work when God's trying to get you attention that's right no matter what contacts you've got it won't work if God's trying to get your attention that's right cuz you can pray you can do all you want to it ain't going to work till he gets through with you I want God to come and help me okay why not just yield oursel to him let him take care of it right come on musicians what do we got a message a man has brought the message y we're not looking for another man to come and bring us another message no and according to Galatians 1:8 if a man come to bring us a message that was contrary to this message then according to the Bible it is to let them be accursed right I think this is the way it ought to be I think this what I think it's what I think it's what brother Brown meant that's all right but let him be a cursed what about it folks can you see right where this messenger stands we'll take this afternoon where the Prophet is talking about that he comes in a lap over God Made A Way God made it to the right place he put everything in the right order he says an open door but what we got to do find the door right just remember this statement until probably Wednesday night remember no bride has ever been in an age she's called out of the age into Jesus Christ physically we are still in lady OA right spiritually we're called out into Christ no bride anywhere any age was ever in an age she was in Christ let's stand what we got brother 381 381 in Sp 3 anyone anybody have a need this world just had that on my mind to think about it I'm just are we really thinking about the messenger com laid somewhere beyond the importance we see where he came open and I came at home in this world if he came back under we better get back to Lord you know I have no friend like [Applause] [Music] what to be expected what to be thank God for the truth world anymore they're all expecting me and that's one thing I know I fixed it up with Jesus so many years ago go I know he'll see me through though I am weak and more and I can't feel at home in this world anymore well oh Lord you know could have been very very dangerous could have been death anywhere around but Lord you took care of it now Lord she's coming asking about dog that it messed up to hear him we ask you to just come down and touch the dog now let everything be all right in [Music] Jesus most of you know that last Sunday sister Regina when they got home the cloud came up and all at once lightning struck around the house and blowed out a lot of things she can tell you the things that happened you know and just you know what happens with that it could have easily been death for anybody because when lightning strikes that away it's just everywhere t a lot of things but yet they were all right that was the main thing she said it' have messed up the hearing of the dog that they had his ears and things so we just pray that the Lord will touch the dog and make it make his hearing okay but we thank God for being with them to take care of them cuz you don't want lightning striking around you you ain't talking about 120 volts you talking about millions of VTS striking making damage to everything thank God he takes care of us [Music] right oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angel me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel that home in this word anymore you're dismissed remember the service this evening Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angels backing me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore
