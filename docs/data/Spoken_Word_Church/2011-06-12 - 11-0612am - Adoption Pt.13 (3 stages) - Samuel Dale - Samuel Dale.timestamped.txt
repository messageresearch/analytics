[47:45] about us cuz the new brother pic was
[47:47] coming Thursday so maybe he's listening
[47:49] so that's good then we have a good time
[47:51] in the Lord okay Ephesians 1 verse vers
[47:55] three blessed be the God and father of
[47:58] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[48:00] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[48:01] places in Christ according as he has
[48:04] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[48:07] of the world that we should be holy and
[48:09] Without Blame before him in love having
[48:11] predestinated us
[48:13] unto us unto the adoption of children by
[48:16] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[48:18] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[48:20] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[48:22] hath made us accepted in the Beloved in
[48:25] whom we have Redemption through his
[48:27] blood to forgiveness of sins according
[48:29] to the riches of his grace now I'm going
[48:31] to read a little bit more here wherein
[48:33] he had abounded toward us in all wisdom
[48:35] and Prudence now piled it on us amen
[48:39] right abounded piled it on to us having
[48:42] made known unto us the mystery what is
[48:44] the mystery to adopt us the prophet said
[48:47] the mystery of his will according to his
[48:49] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[48:51] himself that in the dispensation of the
[48:54] fullness of times he might gather
[48:56] together in one all things were in
[48:59] Christ both which are in heaven and
[49:01] which are on earth even in him all right
[49:05] now let's go to
[49:09] Romans what we're going to do today is
[49:11] just kind of like a review of what we've
[49:13] been talking of let's go to Romans 8 and
[49:16] let's start reading with you start with
[49:17] verse 14 let's start with verse 13 for
[49:20] if we live after the flesh for if ye
[49:23] live after the flesh you shall die but
[49:26] if ye through the spirit do mortify the
[49:29] Deeds of the body you shall live
[49:31] now for as many as are led by the spirit
[49:34] of God they are the sons of God that's
[49:36] right for you have not received the
[49:37] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[49:39] have received the spirit of adoption
[49:41] whereby we cry AB by father the spirit
[49:45] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[49:46] that we are the children of God and if
[49:49] children than ours ARS of God and Joint
[49:52] HS with Christ if so be that we suff
[49:55] suffer with him that we may be also
[49:57] glorified together right for I reckon
[49:59] that the sufferings of this present time
[50:01] are not worthy to be compared with the
[50:03] glory which shall be revealed were in us
[50:07] for the earnest expectation of the
[50:10] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[50:13] of the sons of God you may be seated the
[50:16] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[50:18] the
[50:19] word as I said we're just going to kind
[50:21] of review this morning and uh you
[50:26] know just try to cover what we've been
[50:30] preaching on now for uh this is message
[50:33] number 13 on this about the uh
[50:37] adoption and we've been talking about
[50:39] adoption in three
[50:42] stages three stages that we've been
[50:45] talking about all right and in that you
[50:50] know the reason I chose to do that this
[50:52] morning and then this afternoon we'll
[50:55] pick up the and start on the third stage
[50:58] We have basically been dealing with the
[51:00] number one stage number two stage uh of
[51:04] adoption and I know a lot of times when
[51:07] I lay so much in and and I don't if you
[51:10] notice I do a lot of
[51:12] reviewing uh maybe because my mind is
[51:15] getting old you know and I read a lot
[51:17] review a lot but still I think it's
[51:20] needful for each one of us because you
[51:22] know sometimes we forget because a lot
[51:26] of people think a preacher is just one
[51:28] who they'll give you a shot sermon here
[51:30] a shot sermon there a shot sermon there
[51:32] and you don't know how to tie anything
[51:35] together and at the end of a month you
[51:37] know no more about it being tied
[51:39] together than you did when you started
[51:43] but I'm not that way and I'm sorry if I
[51:46] offend you or you know irk you a little
[51:48] bit by being slow and just gradually
[51:52] going and then review because you know a
[51:55] lot of times we forget well what did he
[51:57] say on message number
[51:59] two you know he said well go back and
[52:01] listen number two well I ain't got time
[52:02] to listen number two what did he say
[52:04] well let's just do a little bit of
[52:06] reviewing this morning and that way we
[52:08] can at least know where we
[52:11] are up to the P the position we're
[52:14] talking about all right and uh you know
[52:17] in doing that then we can can follow it
[52:21] better all right as I said we're trying
[52:24] to cover adoption in three stages
[52:27] because that way you can get a better
[52:29] understanding now before you go in your
[52:32] computer clicks and you your brain you
[52:35] know uh not necessarily them out there
[52:37] clicking but uh you know the brain and
[52:41] uh you know I know that brother brandham
[52:44] covers
[52:45] adoption and how he covers it cuz we've
[52:47] already covered it and you know and he
[52:49] basically says you know like position in
[52:52] Christ he'll bring it out and he'll say
[52:54] now your birth is not not your adoption
[52:56] right the your adoption is your placing
[52:59] all right now that's true wonderful we
[53:01] believe that we we follow that that's
[53:04] what we're talking about all right but
[53:06] we're also talking about how that Paul
[53:08] here in Romans see he's covering it to
[53:13] the basis that he says that as many as
[53:16] are led by the spirit of God they are
[53:17] the sons of God now how did we become
[53:19] the children of God Amen oh I was born
[53:21] of this eternal seed in me I always was
[53:23] a Son of God I okay go believe what you
[53:25] want to that's your problem that's your
[53:28] Jo your doings you know but I'm just
[53:31] just oldfashioned enough to believe that
[53:34] you and I were born in sin shaping in
[53:37] iniquity espoused my mother's wound and
[53:38] went forth a liar amen right and that
[53:41] being lost and doomed and on our way to
[53:44] hell right and the prophet of God saying
[53:46] that he was a h he was a hybrid Y and
[53:50] that being because of the sin in the
[53:52] garden any of these statements I make
[53:55] send me a note I'll be glad to send them
[53:57] to you H and in the there in the fall
[54:00] that happened in the garden that brought
[54:02] us into Satan's domain and made us skin
[54:06] folks to the devil you may think you're
[54:09] worth something but you're worth about
[54:11] probably three bucks right now maybe the
[54:13] cost of living up enough used to be a
[54:15] dollar or something but you know enough
[54:17] pot a and petroleum and this that and
[54:19] the other you you really you know this
[54:21] morning you really stood in front of the
[54:23] mirror you know and you you fixed up
[54:25] everything but just remember you're just
[54:27] a a bag of dirt and that's you know and
[54:31] God's not dealing with that bag of dirt
[54:34] very much that's why he's going to
[54:35] change it one day but you know not get a
[54:38] new one cuz we don't believe in that we
[54:39] believe in this body being redeemed
[54:42] Jesus had nail prints in his hands when
[54:44] he raised so my worry about the other a
[54:46] lot of people believe you're going to
[54:47] get a new body it's this body made new
[54:50] you got quotes from brother brandom said
[54:52] new body that's a fine you got different
[54:54] kind of quotes but that's what I'm
[54:56] giving you like adoption he'll give you
[54:59] a statement in one message that will say
[55:02] your birth is not your
[55:04] adoption right your adoption is your
[55:07] placing right all right see now he's
[55:10] giving you an understanding of what he's
[55:13] talking about right see for the the time
[55:17] and the doing so is it throughout the
[55:19] message all right
[55:21] now but see we know then that in the
[55:25] natural story of adoption that we adopt
[55:28] other people's
[55:29] children you know we we we adopt other
[55:32] you know kids that don't belong to us
[55:34] they were not born to us Etc but in the
[55:37] Old Testament as the prophet would be
[55:39] using it uh the the children of Israel
[55:42] they took the adoption actually uh and
[55:46] you might not like this but it is a was
[55:48] really a Roman custom or one of the back
[55:52] before then and they inherited it into
[55:55] to their doings and they started
[55:59] adopting their children all right see
[56:01] because that would be uh you know in
[56:04] other words it wasn't that God looked
[56:06] down and said hey I like that I put it
[56:07] in the word no I was already in the word
[56:09] right it just somebody else coming along
[56:11] maybe before and and and uh coming up
[56:14] with something and and they inherited
[56:17] the thing of adopting their own children
[56:21] and when they get to be about 12 13 16
[56:24] whatever age you want to make if you go
[56:25] ahead they have the bar MIT some way you
[56:29] pronounce that big old word and you have
[56:32] that and they adopted into the family a
[56:35] child that was born into the family
[56:37] that's right all right see and that's
[56:39] the natural story of adoption right all
[56:42] right the Jews in the natural would
[56:44] adopt their own children and then give
[56:46] them the signate of authorities the
[56:48] things that would happen and the code of
[56:50] Many Colors All right but then taking
[56:54] that see you can't lay as I've tried to
[56:56] get you to see you can't lay everything
[56:59] on the
[57:00] natural and try to come over into the
[57:03] spiritual right because when you do
[57:06] you're going to run ground so in the
[57:09] spiritual part of it now see and the
[57:12] spiritual part we have to find a way to
[57:15] become the children of God right amen
[57:18] all right see because God ain't going to
[57:20] adopt it he ain't going to adopt the
[57:21] devil's kids he's going to adopt his own
[57:24] kids has the authority the positioning
[57:27] etc etc you know coming so he's not
[57:30] going to adopt the devil's children so
[57:33] we have to find a way to become God's
[57:35] children how do we do that by the new
[57:36] birth right see then we're born again by
[57:40] the the new birth bringing us into the
[57:42] family of God as the children of God see
[57:46] all right now that new birth then makes
[57:49] us a child of God Amen but Paul in
[57:53] explaining to the Galatians
[57:55] that a son even though he's born a son
[57:59] he's no different than a servant he's a
[58:02] he's typing from the Old Testament or
[58:05] the use of the adoption by the children
[58:08] of Israel and bringing it over though
[58:10] into a new testament understanding amen
[58:13] and and you know and he's talking to the
[58:16] Galatians well the Bible's not written
[58:18] to a
[58:20] sinner it's written to Christians those
[58:24] that are in Christ all right so then he
[58:27] was telling the Galatians that they were
[58:29] born again by the new birth amen but
[58:32] that they needed to come and grow up the
[58:35] stature of a perfect man as Peter would
[58:38] bring out in his teachings because I
[58:41] believe they had those things the the
[58:44] 120 in the upper room came forth with
[58:46] what would be known as the faith of the
[58:47] fathers and as they did then they were
[58:50] the ones to use to teach others and then
[58:53] as like Paul Etc one coming along Paul
[58:56] especially would talk about him he comes
[58:58] in he gets the new birth well he doesn't
[59:00] get the new birth and it were like the
[59:03] disciples did right if you say he did
[59:05] you got a problem you got to get the
[59:07] sewing of the seed right right he got
[59:10] his eyes blinded his eyes were open he
[59:12] received a new birth he goes to the
[59:13] backs side of the desert for three and
[59:15] A2 years right and then he comes out
[59:18] preaching the same thing the rest of
[59:19] them did why God opened his eyes cuz he
[59:22] was a prophet right all right but he
[59:24] show him the grace and he was standing
[59:26] then with the faith of the fathers
[59:27] because Peter would say even that Paul
[59:30] said things hard to be understood all
[59:33] right and they talked about this
[59:36] adoption this bringing into the family
[59:40] right all right and then Paul as I said
[59:42] writing in Romans he starts out telling
[59:44] them that you're the children of God
[59:47] your new birth makes you a child of God
[59:49] Amen all right but it only makes you a
[59:52] baby right there Desiring the sincere
[59:55] milk of the word it's just the earnest
[59:58] of our inheritance are we in the
[1:00:00] scriptures that's right see and then
[1:00:02] when it is we must grow in Grace and
[1:00:04] knowledge up the stature of a perfect
[1:00:06] man to come back where the disciples
[1:00:09] were all right and then knowing that the
[1:00:12] disciples never received the headstone
[1:00:15] cuz your Prophet said it hadn't come yet
[1:00:17] right so if you want to believe that
[1:00:19] that's all right if you don't everybody
[1:00:20] else thinks oh this and was adopted that
[1:00:22] was adopted they were for the time that
[1:00:24] were in right it's like the prophet of
[1:00:27] God said outside of this day there was
[1:00:28] not a time for the manifestation of the
[1:00:30] Sons and Daughters of God direct quote
[1:00:33] amen but Paul and Peter and them were
[1:00:35] the manifested sons and daughters of God
[1:00:37] for their age amen but he's talking
[1:00:40] about adoption coming to the end time to
[1:00:44] bring us to a position we'll get this
[1:00:46] evening to whip right the Redemption of
[1:00:49] the body that's right all right now I'll
[1:00:52] go ahead and tell you and you know it
[1:00:54] cuz you've heard heard me over and over
[1:00:55] say it I'm not concerned about the
[1:00:57] Redemption of the body right the change
[1:01:01] yeah right or go by the grave come up
[1:01:03] I'm not concerned about that because
[1:01:04] that's not what the Bible's talking
[1:01:06] about right the Bible's talking about to
[1:01:08] it to understand right about the
[1:01:12] Redemption of the body right amen all
[1:01:14] right so that's where we're headed to is
[1:01:16] to have an understanding amen and this
[1:01:19] day is the only day we can have one
[1:01:21] because that's the hour that we're
[1:01:22] living all right that's right but see we
[1:01:24] become a child by the new birth amen all
[1:01:27] right then we grow in Grace and
[1:01:30] knowledge in that new birth until we
[1:01:33] come to the place see to where that God
[1:01:36] can use us and we covered how that the
[1:01:40] adoption is in three stages because the
[1:01:43] Lord Jesus went through the stages we
[1:01:45] were comparing what he went through as
[1:01:48] to what we go through correct all right
[1:01:50] see brother brandom talks about how that
[1:01:53] Jesus on the River Jordan
[1:01:55] and all he was identified as a child of
[1:01:57] God Amen all right but Dar you only hear
[1:02:01] this is this is my son in whom I'm
[1:02:03] pleased to dwell right all right cuz
[1:02:06] that was the beginning that was an
[1:02:08] example to you and I he did not need the
[1:02:10] new birth that's right am to make him a
[1:02:13] child of God he was born God Amen all
[1:02:16] right but he was going through that for
[1:02:18] you and I that's right right Amen to
[1:02:21] where we could come through those stages
[1:02:22] see all right so P one he was
[1:02:25] identified this is my beloved Son in
[1:02:29] whom I'm pleased to dwell amen all right
[1:02:32] see then we we we like to make things
[1:02:34] applied to him or something but not to
[1:02:37] us because we we have problems seemingly
[1:02:40] saying that when we receive the new
[1:02:42] birth you realize God is saing I'm
[1:02:44] pleased to dwell amen that's right he's
[1:02:47] identifying you by giving you the new
[1:02:49] birth that's right he's identifying you
[1:02:51] as a child of God he pleased to dwell in
[1:02:53] you am
[1:02:55] maybe not like he wants to I'll agree
[1:02:57] with that now but still that ain't got
[1:02:59] nothing to do with it you know no matter
[1:03:01] how mean our kids get we're still their
[1:03:03] kids right right I've never disowned one
[1:03:06] one of the kids yet you know what have
[1:03:09] said yet but you
[1:03:11] know but see you don't have to worry
[1:03:14] about it they are children and no matter
[1:03:15] what they would ever do they are
[1:03:17] children and that's why the prophet of
[1:03:19] God would cover it then that using the
[1:03:22] Old Testament example that if that child
[1:03:25] never came to a position to be able to
[1:03:28] be trusted he was never adopted into the
[1:03:31] family but it didn't mean he was pushed
[1:03:33] away from the eating table right it
[1:03:36] didn't mean he was thrown out you know
[1:03:37] and left home right no you know no see
[1:03:41] you don't carry you type too far right
[1:03:43] he wasn't throw away just because he was
[1:03:45] a child he still ateed the father's
[1:03:48] table he still had his inheritance as we
[1:03:51] read here see
[1:03:55] even Jacob and what is Jacob and
[1:03:58] Esau they both had an inheritance right
[1:04:01] Jacob just wanted to birth right amen
[1:04:04] see and he could get a double portion on
[1:04:05] those forms but the thing of what I'm
[1:04:07] saying he says in verse 15 that we've
[1:04:10] received the spirit not the spirit of
[1:04:16] bondage again under fear but we've
[1:04:19] received the spirit of adoption amen the
[1:04:22] new birth is the spirit of adoption to
[1:04:25] adopt us into the family of God right
[1:04:28] all right but that doesn't positionally
[1:04:30] Place us that's right that just
[1:04:32] identifies Us in the body as the
[1:04:34] children of God all right Sons and
[1:04:37] Daughters of the Living God to grow in
[1:04:39] Grace and knowledge then being born
[1:04:41] again as the scripture would say all
[1:04:43] right but see the Lord Jesus had a
[1:04:46] identification time River Jordan where
[1:04:48] he was identified amen but then on the
[1:04:50] Mount of transfiguration as we were
[1:04:52] bringing the other night see then you
[1:04:54] hear hear him say this is my beloved Son
[1:04:55] in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him
[1:04:59] amen Matthew 17 see he was adopted into
[1:05:04] the family all right now here's where
[1:05:08] that we we mened a lot too as I tried to
[1:05:11] explain
[1:05:13] there you look at the ministry of the
[1:05:16] Lord
[1:05:17] Jesus right and in his early Ministry
[1:05:20] there were great signs and wonders but
[1:05:22] in the life's part of his Ministry when
[1:05:24] he came to
[1:05:27] Authority he's going to Calvary that's
[1:05:30] right right mhm very little happens from
[1:05:33] there amen but a wonderful thing does
[1:05:35] happen he goes to Matthew 24 and
[1:05:37] preaches those seals right all right we
[1:05:40] compared it with brother brandom's
[1:05:41] ministry right right brother random you
[1:05:45] can argue all you want to about where he
[1:05:46] was adopted at I believe he was adopted
[1:05:49] there in Arizona in ' 63 when the Angels
[1:05:51] come down you can argue the point I'm
[1:05:53] not arguing with nobody because I ain't
[1:05:54] got time I'm a preacher of the Gospel
[1:05:56] not argue the gospel all right and see
[1:05:59] then whatever you say we all would have
[1:06:01] to agree he did come to adoption
[1:06:04] somewhere all right so then not you wor
[1:06:06] about the point where you argue about it
[1:06:08] all right but see brother randam then
[1:06:10] once he comes through he's got a great
[1:06:13] ministry 500,000 people 300,000 people
[1:06:17] great signs and wonders are happening
[1:06:19] all kind of healings the dead raised the
[1:06:21] sick healed all kind of speaking the
[1:06:23] word
[1:06:25] but then when he comes to Arizona and no
[1:06:28] seals is preached he said I'll lose
[1:06:30] thousands of my friends y he wound up
[1:06:33] preaching to 30 people in a trailer out
[1:06:35] there in Arizona y I know the meetings
[1:06:37] he had meetings of pretty good size but
[1:06:39] you know what I'm talking about that's
[1:06:41] right once he came to the position of
[1:06:44] what we call the third pool
[1:06:46] yeah then it seemed to be a whole lot
[1:06:49] less about taking place
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] see it don't look right does
[1:06:57] it I say that because I don't want us to
[1:07:01] get a thing of looking at adoption and
[1:07:04] headstone and things like that it's so
[1:07:06] high until nobody can find it or never
[1:07:08] reach it well let's don't make it so
[1:07:10] easy till everybody in the world just
[1:07:12] stumbles into it listening to brother
[1:07:15] the other day preaching about it and the
[1:07:18] thing Brother Richard but anyhow you
[1:07:19] know people come in the message in 3
[1:07:21] months they know all about the seals
[1:07:23] yeah mhm you know why cuz they read the
[1:07:26] book
[1:07:27] yeah boy that's a lot they they they
[1:07:31] know all about the message in 3 months
[1:07:34] they straighten everybody else out they
[1:07:35] send the message been in it for 40
[1:07:37] years but they straighten You Out Boy
[1:07:40] because they're they're they're well
[1:07:42] that's all right I'm not trying to
[1:07:44] straighten nobody out but me that's
[1:07:47] right I'm the only gu I'm trying to
[1:07:48] straighten out now if you reap the
[1:07:51] benefits from it and let it straighten
[1:07:52] you out that's fine I'm just working on
[1:07:54] me cuz that's the only one I can work on
[1:07:56] I'm not going to beat you to death right
[1:07:59] like most of the preachers do about you
[1:08:01] hire you dress you clothes or this or
[1:08:02] that or the other and never preach the
[1:08:04] truth I'm going to preach the word and
[1:08:05] let the word
[1:08:07] deliver and then if you're a hypocrite
[1:08:09] if you don't do what the word says
[1:08:11] that's where brother Dale gets plain
[1:08:13] when he says things but you're just a
[1:08:14] plain old hypocrite that's right you go
[1:08:16] out and cut your heart and do these
[1:08:18] things sisters then you just prove
[1:08:19] you're lost right ain't no need to
[1:08:21] playing that's right you're lost amen he
[1:08:25] going get saved amen and then it'll
[1:08:27] automatically take care of itself that's
[1:08:29] right see that's the way brother
[1:08:31] preaches but I know I'm not understood
[1:08:32] about that but but now listen see the
[1:08:35] Lord Jesus came to a place of
[1:08:39] authority manifestation
[1:08:43] Authority his name was just as good on
[1:08:45] the checkbook as his father's right
[1:08:47] brother R said God gives you when you
[1:08:49] are born again Christian he said he
[1:08:51] gives you a
[1:08:52] check you got the checkbook you know you
[1:08:55] got everything in Jesus's name is signed
[1:08:57] at the bottom right so whatever you need
[1:09:00] you just sign your name y I mean you
[1:09:04] don't sign you just fill in what you
[1:09:06] need then the next step is what your
[1:09:09] names is good on the checkbook then he
[1:09:10] gives you where you can spill in what
[1:09:11] you need and sign your own name amen now
[1:09:14] that was a prophet's definition of
[1:09:16] showing us Grace and knowledge our
[1:09:18] growth development our child training
[1:09:21] righten see coming up through the the
[1:09:24] statue of a perfect man that's right and
[1:09:26] coming out to show us Jesus Christ
[1:09:28] Living in you CU remember now what was
[1:09:31] our one thought that we kept making and
[1:09:33] kept emphasizing and we'll keep
[1:09:35] emphasizing in your natural adoption to
[1:09:38] Father har as a tutor right which is not
[1:09:42] related to maybe or something but he
[1:09:45] hires a tutor but not so in the
[1:09:48] spiritual the end is spiritual right
[1:09:51] brother R said the Holy Ghost is your
[1:09:53] tutor well now the Holy Ghost and the
[1:09:55] fathers the self-sign spirit are Jesus
[1:09:57] had two daddies now I'm quoting brother
[1:10:00] R so now the Holy Ghost and the father
[1:10:03] is a selfs sameed Spirit then the tutor
[1:10:05] came into you at the new birth which is
[1:10:07] the holy spirit right which is the
[1:10:09] spirit of almighty God
[1:10:12] Amen brother BR says you have in you by
[1:10:14] the new birth what Father Son and Holy
[1:10:16] Ghost
[1:10:17] right it's not that you got a father to
[1:10:20] doing this a little bit and a son doing
[1:10:22] this and the Holy Ghost doing this and
[1:10:25] no that's only for breaking it down for
[1:10:28] dispensational understandings that's
[1:10:29] right but see the tutor is the holy
[1:10:32] spirit which is the spirit of the father
[1:10:34] so when this doing the father is inside
[1:10:36] of you and I right so what what I always
[1:10:38] taught you about adoption most people
[1:10:41] think adoption is the father leaving the
[1:10:43] scene and the son coming on the scene
[1:10:46] you know I've never agreed with that I
[1:10:48] don't believe
[1:10:50] it in spiritual adoption that's natural
[1:10:53] adoption all right but in spiritual
[1:10:55] adoption right or in the body of Christ
[1:10:58] it's the father coming on the scene in
[1:11:01] his children because that's what Jesus
[1:11:02] was right Jesus was God made manifest in
[1:11:07] human flesh right you agree the father
[1:11:10] made manifest in flesh well you ain't
[1:11:12] nothing but Oneness well all right all
[1:11:14] right what do you Tess or Tresses or
[1:11:17] whatever let's get all the NES out of
[1:11:18] the way and go on forget it but
[1:11:22] listen
[1:11:24] Jesus had a river Jordan that's right
[1:11:27] identification brother random had a time
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:30] identification Jesus had a amount of
[1:11:32] transfiguration experience brother
[1:11:34] random had a amount of transfiguration
[1:11:35] experience you and I must have the same
[1:11:37] thing that's right we must have a a
[1:11:40] river Jordan experience of the new birth
[1:11:42] to bring us in to make us the children
[1:11:44] of God The Offspring of God as Paul
[1:11:47] would call it and then we must grow in
[1:11:49] Grace and knowledge till we come to the
[1:11:50] work that we can have the authority
[1:11:53] invest Ed into us it's like we come into
[1:11:56] message we've been there and this
[1:11:57] brother had been in up the church first
[1:12:00] church we were in you know and boy he'd
[1:12:02] get up you know he'd heard brother
[1:12:03] random and he'd get up and he'd say I
[1:12:06] take every spirit in here under my
[1:12:08] control I thought but you sure made a
[1:12:12] chenge right yeah CU that's brother
[1:12:16] random didn't do that in his early
[1:12:18] Ministry it took him a while before he
[1:12:21] ever come to the position of saying I
[1:12:22] take everything in here under my control
[1:12:24] he knew that angel was standing there
[1:12:26] there a reason he could do it that's
[1:12:28] right it wasn't him anyway was it it was
[1:12:30] Christ all right but you understand now
[1:12:33] see but then what we've got to
[1:12:35] do see is we've got to come to the third
[1:12:39] stage of it which will
[1:12:42] be the completion or the finishing of
[1:12:45] the Redemption of the body and we'll get
[1:12:47] on it this afternoon to cover you know
[1:12:50] where we're at but to just look at it
[1:12:54] see full sunship comes into existence at
[1:12:57] Mount of
[1:12:59] transfiguration all right now full
[1:13:02] sunship came into existence matter of
[1:13:05] transfiguration okay then he goes from
[1:13:07] there straight to Calvary as I said very
[1:13:10] little preaching done but the greatest
[1:13:12] of all he preached those seals in
[1:13:13] Matthew 24 right on his way to Calvary
[1:13:16] all right so have we understood the
[1:13:18] seals that's
[1:13:20] right I thought the seals was to
[1:13:23] revealed a complete Plan of Redemption
[1:13:25] amen right is that right amen so that it
[1:13:29] would mean Body Spirit and soul right am
[1:13:32] see this Prophet come to do something
[1:13:33] that none of the rest of him couldn't do
[1:13:35] Paul could tell you about a change of
[1:13:38] the body right but he never attained it
[1:13:40] that's right he can tell you how you
[1:13:42] change the moment twinkle of an ey right
[1:13:43] but he never attained unto it right but
[1:13:46] somebody's going to have to attain to it
[1:13:48] right see even brother Bram didn't
[1:13:50] attain them to it right right see so
[1:13:53] they're waiting on you and I Amen to
[1:13:56] reach a position see to where that we
[1:13:58] can see that we are the children of God
[1:14:02] Amen all now I just gave you some quotes
[1:14:06] because I know that in preaching a lot
[1:14:07] of times I just jump across something
[1:14:10] and and I've tried to make the emphasis
[1:14:12] of the three stages of Grace or the
[1:14:15] three stages of adoption in the basis of
[1:14:19] showing you that it's just a deeper one
[1:14:21] because really I I don't believe in
[1:14:23] three stages I don't believe in three
[1:14:24] works of Grace right you say wait miss a
[1:14:28] minute no I don't believe in three works
[1:14:30] of
[1:14:31] Grace I believe in three stages of
[1:14:34] Grace right cuz if you call it works you
[1:14:37] got a problem
[1:14:38] right three stages
[1:14:41] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:14:44] of the Holy Ghost right three stages of
[1:14:48] your new birth all right now
[1:14:50] justification is the work of the Holy
[1:14:52] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[1:14:53] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:14:56] spirit so it stages of the same thing so
[1:14:58] is your
[1:15:00] adoption you're adopted into the family
[1:15:02] of God by the new birth you become HS
[1:15:05] joint AES amen that's right you don't
[1:15:08] have to grow up to become a joint air
[1:15:11] that's why Paul calls it in Galatians
[1:15:13] say though he be heir of all right
[1:15:18] amen read Galatians 4 there though he
[1:15:21] become air of all but yet he's like
[1:15:25] a servant
[1:15:29] right now that's what I said
[1:15:32] now we we take that as the wrong way and
[1:15:35] that's why I tried to emphasize the the
[1:15:37] Lord Jesus and the great ministry and
[1:15:38] the brother around him in the great
[1:15:40] ministry that he had and then seemingly
[1:15:42] at the end of it when it gets toward the
[1:15:44] opening of the word more that it seems
[1:15:46] to taper
[1:15:47] off but as I said now remember a child
[1:15:50] is born into the family Paul is not not
[1:15:53] saying that he's a
[1:15:55] servant now you ever been up
[1:15:57] to um builtmore house all right those
[1:16:02] were built in slave days and things you
[1:16:04] know kind of in that order and they had
[1:16:06] a brown laundry and then a white laundry
[1:16:09] now you know the difference right the
[1:16:11] white laundry was for the owners and the
[1:16:13] people but they had a brown laundry
[1:16:15] which was for the slaves are the people
[1:16:18] who are
[1:16:20] workers all right so now don't get that
[1:16:22] kind of an idea about being born into
[1:16:25] the family of God right well I'm no
[1:16:28] different than a
[1:16:30] slave that's not what Paul is saying
[1:16:33] slaves don't eat at the master's table
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:38] right slaves eat at their own meals
[1:16:42] brother Brady used to tickle me to death
[1:16:44] when he used were talking about over
[1:16:45] there and helping and cooking and doing
[1:16:47] the thing for that Queen and he said
[1:16:49] there we was cooking that Queen's old
[1:16:51] dog of steak and we was having to eat
[1:16:53] what we could and he finally got even
[1:16:56] with the dog yeah cuz the dog killed
[1:17:00] some chickens and he killed the
[1:17:02] dog but the point I'm trying to get you
[1:17:05] to see if you're a child of God glory
[1:17:11] amen that's right you know God hears

[1:18:42] people get it in their mind well a no
[1:18:44] one got nothing so we just sit down and
[1:18:45] wait on the bus to pull
[1:18:48] up well just make sure you're at the bus
[1:18:51] depot
[1:18:54] you remember the story I told you
[1:18:56] brother P he came in you know and he's
[1:18:57] got these thing down man he can tell you
[1:18:59] every time you move and he can tell
[1:19:00] youever bus that goes from what town to
[1:19:02] what town cuz that's the way they travel
[1:19:04] over there and he came in one day and we
[1:19:06] talking about and he said you got to
[1:19:07] take me to the bus depot I said brother
[1:19:09] because Cas they ain't no bus depot in
[1:19:11] gang I took it to Athens a couple of
[1:19:12] times cuz I knew where the bus depot was
[1:19:15] in Athens and he said no there one in
[1:19:17] Gainesville I said Don sir it used to be
[1:19:19] down at the train station well it was
[1:19:21] the bus depot and the station was the
[1:19:23] same
[1:19:25] place I said no no we got to go to
[1:19:28] Athens he said you don't have to go
[1:19:29] there he said D this number right here
[1:19:31] and find out I di the number I said this
[1:19:34] a bus depot and game yes I said where's
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:37] at you used to be down at the train
[1:19:39] station he said no sir we're no longer
[1:19:41] there he said you know where the tractor
[1:19:43] place is forgot what the name of Holland
[1:19:46] tractor PE mon tractor and I said yes
[1:19:48] sir he said there's the bus depot
[1:19:50] brother Cas said I told you
[1:19:53] but my point is
[1:19:55] listen as
[1:19:58] babies
[1:19:59] children we can cry out to our father
[1:20:02] and he heals us and delivers us and
[1:20:04] guides us it's not what growth
[1:20:06] development healings and things are not
[1:20:08] based upon growth development healing is
[1:20:11] based upon the basis of whether or not
[1:20:13] you can believe
[1:20:15] it see all right but we're born into the
[1:20:18] family of God by the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost and then we can expect to come and
[1:20:22] then and then only can we expect to come
[1:20:24] to a position of
[1:20:27] authority you know but see I just want
[1:20:30] you to read some of the things because
[1:20:32] I'm saying now listen here's my point uh
[1:20:35] I kind of with background a little bit
[1:20:37] but here's the point of what I want you
[1:20:39] to
[1:20:39] see is we we look at authorities we look
[1:20:42] at adoption and we just place it at
[1:20:45] one's
[1:20:46] spot all right and here I'm over there
[1:20:49] you know if I can never get that Yeah
[1:20:53] Boy things going to happen we first come
[1:20:56] into message Morey people would say you
[1:20:57] know they say boy one of these days
[1:21:00] won't be able to speak that
[1:21:04] word I made a simple statement then it I
[1:21:06] still make I said we got to get the word
[1:21:08] before we can speak the word plain
[1:21:12] language that was my point then that's
[1:21:14] my point now amen that's why in the
[1:21:17] Bible you do not see a novice writing
[1:21:19] the scripture right right amen you don't
[1:21:22] see a babe in Christ writing the
[1:21:26] Bible it's those who are tutored in the
[1:21:28] gospel that writes the Bible see because
[1:21:33] you can't trust a baby and and all cuz
[1:21:35] he blabbered too much all right but now
[1:21:38] I want us to just read some things and I
[1:21:41] want us to to not try to destroy in our
[1:21:43] mind a thought but keep a thought in our
[1:21:46] mind that there is an adoption to be
[1:21:49] reached there's a position to be reached
[1:21:52] right there's a place to be reached that
[1:21:54] Authority comes into position right and
[1:21:57] as it comes into position then we
[1:22:00] can see and expect things to take place
[1:22:03] in a greater development than we do as
[1:22:05] when we're just babies in Christ but I
[1:22:07] don't want us to forget the point that
[1:22:09] we're born into the family of God and
[1:22:12] that is God adopting us into his family
[1:22:15] that's why Paul calls it Romans um 15
[1:22:18] 8:15 calls it the spirit of
[1:22:20] adoption because it's the new M then he
[1:22:23] goes on down to the 19th verse and
[1:22:26] talking about the Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:28] God the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:22:31] Daughters of God that the whole world is
[1:22:33] groaning
[1:22:34] waiting now the Bible doesn't tell you
[1:22:37] that the world is waiting for babies to
[1:22:38] be born that's right babies in Christ it
[1:22:41] doesn't say that it's waiting for
[1:22:43] sunship right to reach a position I even
[1:22:46] read you all the other translations off
[1:22:48] of that you know where that they would
[1:22:49] say this the the right of sunship and
[1:22:52] they they they kept the point of of all
[1:22:55] the translators kept the point of this
[1:22:56] adoption to to run into the right
[1:22:59] place but I don't want you to
[1:23:01] forget that when brother Brandon says we
[1:23:04] have something
[1:23:06] now yeah now here's the way it goes you
[1:23:10] know
[1:23:12] now well what that means brother Dale he
[1:23:15] had it nobody else didn't have
[1:23:20] it now well I I kind of like just
[1:23:24] believe what he
[1:23:26] says blessing but I understand the full
[1:23:29] story too and I've tried to express it
[1:23:32] to you just now we're not making this
[1:23:34] thing so easy until you can come in the
[1:23:37] body of Christ today and stumble into it
[1:23:39] and and be so up at The Headstone and
[1:23:41] gone out of here right I've never looked
[1:23:44] at nothing like that you say well what
[1:23:46] about some people might come in right
[1:23:48] sure but they're linked to you and I
[1:23:51] right God can Quicken the word in a
[1:23:54] hurry to somebody true he quickened the
[1:23:58] disciples they had 100 they had uh 3 and
[1:24:01] 1/2 years of ministry he quickened them
[1:24:04] they had to Faith of the fathers right
[1:24:07] he opened their understanding of the
[1:24:08] scriptures that didn't give the new
[1:24:09] birth read your
[1:24:11] Bible he opened a road to a mess he
[1:24:13] opened the understanding of the two
[1:24:15] going to a mess he opened the
[1:24:17] understanding of those that was was you
[1:24:19] know the disciples when they gathered at
[1:24:22] hisory
[1:24:24] with and in doing that when he opened
[1:24:27] their understanding that didn't give
[1:24:28] them the new birth right they still had
[1:24:30] to wait until Calvary was you know the
[1:24:32] phix of Calvary for theirselves dying
[1:24:35] out to theirselves enough and going to
[1:24:37] the upper room to receive you know and
[1:24:39] the day of Pentecost coming all right so
[1:24:42] now we don't do that either so I want
[1:24:44] you to look at some of the things the
[1:24:45] prophet said but notice what he's
[1:24:47] talking about he's talking about
[1:24:48] something already in
[1:24:50] existence do you see that that's where
[1:24:52] people are not looking at it
[1:24:54] right we're looking at it that one day
[1:24:56] we're going to
[1:24:59] come instead of looking at what is right
[1:25:03] well I tell you though if we was you
[1:25:05] know if you had what you think then you
[1:25:07] could just come and deliver
[1:25:09] me if you got what you think you got
[1:25:12] come on come on that's it I accept my
[1:25:15] part of it I'll be glad to pray the
[1:25:17] prayer of faith
[1:25:19] right lay hands on you do anything you
[1:25:21] want to
[1:25:24] but the healing is in you amen it's not
[1:25:27] in me right Jesus said I can't do
[1:25:30] nothing except my father shows me that's
[1:25:32] right right all right see don't blame
[1:25:35] everybody else for our unbelief amen
[1:25:39] let's accept what we've got and then
[1:25:40] move on with it all right right now
[1:25:43] watch what he starts telling
[1:25:47] us how that you're adopted into the body
[1:25:49] of Christ right see
[1:25:53] now get to point
[1:25:55] now spiritual
[1:25:57] adoption the new birth into the body of
[1:26:00] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:03] then we talk about adoption coming to
[1:26:05] where you're
[1:26:07] predestinated unto adoption right you
[1:26:10] know that everybody in the Bible was not
[1:26:12] predestinated unto
[1:26:14] adoption right or else Paul wouldn't
[1:26:16] have said that that's
[1:26:19] right in Ephesians he said predestinated
[1:26:22] to adoption the prophet said that's this
[1:26:24] end time people is the ones that's
[1:26:25] predestinate you remember there's a word
[1:26:27] or seed to be made Alive by every age
[1:26:30] but this is the age for all of the word
[1:26:32] to be made alive amen all right now
[1:26:35] listen to what he's saying in Christ
[1:26:36] 1955 2:21 in Phoenix and through the
[1:26:40] blood you become part of him and through
[1:26:42] the same cell that he came out of now
[1:26:45] what and the Very presence and part of
[1:26:48] God comes into you now that's pretty
[1:26:52] it's pretty good is it I like that into
[1:26:54] the same cell that he came out of now
[1:26:58] that's not talking about blood
[1:27:01] right I'm talking about spiritual
[1:27:03] condition amen the very presence and
[1:27:07] part of God that comes part of God comes
[1:27:09] into you by faith you purchase it and
[1:27:13] that same holy spirit that was in the
[1:27:15] Lord Jesus Christ comes into you and
[1:27:19] then you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:21] adopt by the Lord Jesus Christ into the
[1:27:24] body of Christ amen right
[1:27:28] Hallelujah when you receive the new
[1:27:30] birth you're adopted into the family of
[1:27:33] Christ
[1:27:35] amen the same life that was in him right
[1:27:39] is then in you amen as a baby yes but
[1:27:42] it's
[1:27:45] there DNA and the natural provise
[1:27:47] whether you're children or not right H
[1:27:51] DNA and the spiritual what you do with
[1:27:53] the word where I think Pentecost failed
[1:27:55] 1955
[1:27:57] 1111 oh he's real adopted by the father
[1:28:01] into the fellowship and into the body of
[1:28:04] Believers by the Holy Ghost right and a
[1:28:07] Vindicated Ministry Pro it you don't
[1:28:10] have to talk so much about it God does
[1:28:12] his own talking right let see into the
[1:28:15] body of
[1:28:16] Believers you said well that's only when
[1:28:18] it comes to the final
[1:28:20] adoption it's all right
[1:28:23] I like what he go I love to read this so
[1:28:25] let's read
[1:28:26] it now if we have went to seeking the
[1:28:30] give if we had have went to seeking the
[1:28:34] giver instead of the
[1:28:36] gifts now listen to it I believe the
[1:28:39] church would have been further up the
[1:28:41] road don't you think
[1:28:43] so if we stayed close to God and loved
[1:28:47] him and just kept living for him and not
[1:28:51] trying to push things over just live for
[1:28:54] God and live a pure holy life and live
[1:28:59] and pray every day keep yourself
[1:29:01] refreshed in his presence God will take
[1:29:03] care of the rest of it I like
[1:29:05] that cuz you see that's what I've always
[1:29:07] tried to get you to
[1:29:09] see if I have the
[1:29:11] giver I have all gifts right that's
[1:29:14] right but I can have gifts without
[1:29:16] having to give her right
[1:29:20] y right Satan can pass out Supernatural
[1:29:23] gifts that's what your Prophet
[1:29:26] said the gifts and callings are without
[1:29:28] repentance right that's what the Bible
[1:29:30] says right amen but you see if we just
[1:29:33] sought the giver instead of the gifts
[1:29:36] right right all right that's all I've
[1:29:38] ever tried to do now just do what you
[1:29:40] want to with the wording the way I say
[1:29:42] it come let us reason together 1955
[1:29:46] 10:04 now but we are sons of God like he
[1:29:50] was but adopted sons of God by his grace
[1:29:55] watch by the death of Jesus God's son
[1:30:00] brings us into relationship to God now
[1:30:04] then God with his adopted sons has said
[1:30:09] in the church some Apostles prophets
[1:30:13] evangelist brother Rand can talk about
[1:30:15] adoption and talking about a new
[1:30:20] birth see when you mention adoption to
[1:30:22] people in this message just wh wh
[1:30:24] through you know going on
[1:30:26] up I believe you're born into the family
[1:30:28] of God I believe you're adopted into the
[1:30:30] family of God right by the new birth
[1:30:32] souls in prison 1963 1110 the morning
[1:30:36] service look down to what's underline
[1:30:38] you read the rest of it I just give you
[1:30:39] that to save time there's three offices
[1:30:41] of one God there three attributes of the
[1:30:44] same God you're a part of God and I'm a
[1:30:46] part of God but I'm not all of God and
[1:30:48] neither are you all of God see see it's
[1:30:51] attributes of God upon us as the sons
[1:30:54] adopted by Jesus Christ which God
[1:30:57] himself become flesh to Die For
[1:31:07] Us
[1:31:09] raising jer's daughter 1956 731 talking
[1:31:13] about the Dove and all and how they've
[1:31:14] come together the lamb was one creature
[1:31:16] the dve was another now he's manifested
[1:31:19] in your flesh by being adopted sons and
[1:31:21] daughters to the kingdom of God through
[1:31:24] the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:28] Spirit that's right and you become joint
[1:31:30] ours with the Lord Jesus Christ oh
[1:31:33] Church you got the power if you got the
[1:31:37] faith to use it
[1:31:40] with
[1:31:42] see but if you make everything a way up
[1:31:45] here see way up there him and then how
[1:31:48] are you going to get up
[1:31:50] there that's why I said three
[1:31:53] stages
[1:31:55] justification takes a holy spirit to
[1:31:57] justify you takes a holy spirit to
[1:31:59] sanctify takes the Holy Spirit to give
[1:32:01] you new birth that's right the Holy
[1:32:03] Spirit comes in a new birth and gives
[1:32:05] you adoption into the family of God
[1:32:07] making you a child of God air of all
[1:32:10] things but yet we're under the tutor
[1:32:12] which is the holy spirit until the
[1:32:14] training time comes the second stage
[1:32:18] Authority then we can talk about the
[1:32:20] Redemption of the body but listen you
[1:32:23] got a lot more them I just won't fool
[1:32:25] with it cuz I'm not trying to prove a
[1:32:27] point other than one thing you go ahead
[1:32:29] and read
[1:32:31] them I believe that we're adopted into
[1:32:33] the family of God by the new
[1:32:36] birth but then we must grow in Grace and
[1:32:39] knowledge amen it took the prophet 30
[1:32:42] years 33 I think it was to preach the
[1:32:45] statute of perfect man now that's what
[1:32:46] he
[1:32:48] said y he said I've been all these years
[1:32:50] in 30 years something years and we've
[1:32:53] been 40 something years since the
[1:32:55] prophet left the
[1:32:56] scene and people are going haywired or
[1:32:59] we don't know what to do we don't know
[1:33:00] what's going on we don't have n we don't
[1:33:02] have this we don't have that and then
[1:33:04] somebody jumps up and gets a little
[1:33:06] thing started especially a young
[1:33:07] Minister he jumps up and he starts
[1:33:10] running real good with it and get a
[1:33:12] little move going among the people and
[1:33:13] everybody just flocks after him he
[1:33:15] trying to find something well I thought
[1:33:17] my tutor was inside of me that's right
[1:33:22] I enjoy all of those things too but like
[1:33:24] I've always said leave them
[1:33:26] alone I don't need arguing with them F
[1:33:29] would leave alone they'll run their
[1:33:31] course and when they run their course
[1:33:32] they'll settle down and become good Sons
[1:33:34] and Daughters of god good preachers if
[1:33:35] not they're go on off in the garbage
[1:33:37] skins right right so don't worry about
[1:33:40] it see for 40 something years I tried to
[1:33:43] get you to see who you are right you are
[1:33:47] a child of God Amen by the new birth
[1:33:51] right you know what would be the biggest
[1:33:52] shame and disgrace for them to ask me
[1:33:54] for run to run for president of the
[1:33:56] United
[1:33:57] States that'd be a shame and a disgrace
[1:34:00] y that's right cuz I'd have to step down
[1:34:02] as a preacher a pastor y to become
[1:34:05] president now I'd give up the greatest
[1:34:07] office there is in the world to take
[1:34:08] this cheapest garbage
[1:34:11] can boy you don't no I ain't got no
[1:34:14] problem with Obama he done this as good
[1:34:16] M would have done no different I told
[1:34:17] you that you can argue all you want to
[1:34:20] about this that or the other not doing
[1:34:21] it my Bible says God puts in Kings and
[1:34:24] takes out Kings right that's right
[1:34:28] straight last time I voted was John F
[1:34:30] Kennedy I found out he was a Catholic
[1:34:32] and I had put him in the office I ain't
[1:34:33] voted since
[1:34:35] then you vote do what you want to I'm
[1:34:38] just telling
[1:34:39] you cuz I'm not trying to be no lordship
[1:34:41] of nothing I'm just telling you how I am
[1:34:45] right but you see it wouldn't make no
[1:34:46] difference who they put in the White
[1:34:47] House brother Brown said put a George
[1:34:49] Washington and Abraham Lincoln and there
[1:34:51] office still go amen is that what he
[1:34:54] said he said you couldn't pull it out no

[1:37:47] well life and get ready for the
[1:37:49] test right am
[1:37:51] see things are going to go
[1:37:54] wrong and our father allows it he said
[1:37:58] he would allow someone to say something
[1:38:00] to you to see how you would react
[1:38:03] right I gave you the story about it you
[1:38:05] know remember the the man when brother
[1:38:07] around and spoke to sister had right and
[1:38:08] said you know about the squirrels and
[1:38:10] the things and he had shot that squirrel
[1:38:12] and couldn't find it and that brother
[1:38:14] prayed that night said now now Lord show
[1:38:16] that brother Ram's right said let him
[1:38:18] find that squirrel boy everybody brother
[1:38:20] r everybody read the message everybody
[1:38:23] was upset with
[1:38:24] him but when they asked him about it
[1:38:26] later he didn't realize he prayed that
[1:38:29] way God knows how to train his children
[1:38:33] he knows how to train that Prophet
[1:38:35] right he knows how to train me and you
[1:38:39] child
[1:38:40] training but what does it come out to be
[1:38:42] thank Lord See You and I by the opening
[1:38:46] of the word now this is what I've taught
[1:38:47] you right since about 1980 I've taught
[1:38:50] you one thing
[1:38:52] how do we grow up the stature of a
[1:38:53] perfect man how do we have faith virtue
[1:38:56] knowledge Temperance patience Godly
[1:38:57] brother well I got to have it so I just
[1:38:59] have it and that don't work does
[1:39:02] it right it's by the opening of the word
[1:39:05] amen right
[1:39:07] amen amen that's all I've ever tried to
[1:39:10] preach to you then the word where you
[1:39:11] can make a choice amen right now the
[1:39:14] opening of the word as I said the other
[1:39:15] day the Lord Jesus preached six seals on
[1:39:18] his way to
[1:39:20] Calvary brother brandham preached six
[1:39:22] sealed on his way to rejection by
[1:39:24] mankind right why is the people so
[1:39:28] scared of the seals in the Daniel 70
[1:39:30] weeks and the thing when he said in the
[1:39:33] Daniel 70 weeks if you don't understand
[1:39:35] this you'll miss it in the
[1:39:37] seals but yet nobody wants to know
[1:39:39] anything about those things that's right
[1:39:42] but that's the things that I've tried to
[1:39:44] break down to you to where at least to
[1:39:45] give you a choice of whether you could
[1:39:47] hear the both sides of the story or
[1:39:49] nothing else right what the prop had to
[1:39:52] say cuz you see it's not I'll bring it
[1:39:55] this evening we'll get into it it's not
[1:39:58] the Redemption of the body see that's
[1:40:00] this that's where you're looking at it
[1:40:02] well one of these days I'll be adopted I
[1:40:04] I'll step in that new
[1:40:06] body well we got to get there right see
[1:40:09] it right there because the Lord Jesus
[1:40:11] Christ went to man of
[1:40:13] transfiguration and the next 6 months
[1:40:16] was the most horrible times of his
[1:40:19] life
[1:40:21] you agree amen 6 months 3 months
[1:40:23] whatever you want to make it you know
[1:40:25] what I'm talking about amen when he left
[1:40:28] Mount of transfiguration he's headed
[1:40:30] straight to
[1:40:31] Calvary The Garden of Gethsemane death
[1:40:34] to himself yielding up all that he
[1:40:37] had brother brandom comes along and
[1:40:39] follows the same line right because of
[1:40:43] this on the seventh seal he said
[1:40:44] thousands of my friends Rel
[1:40:49] me
[1:40:51] well don't you think you and I going to
[1:40:53] go through the same
[1:40:57] thing I've never believed in it and I
[1:40:59] never taught you that the bride's going
[1:41:01] through the tribulation you know better
[1:41:02] I've never done it but I have taught you
[1:41:05] that we need persecution right asz a
[1:41:08] prophet says a church always does better
[1:41:10] under
[1:41:11] persecution now that's the words of your
[1:41:14] Prophet when you got a good foot big you
[1:41:17] know got a big old belly full a banana
[1:41:19] pudding you ain't interested in eating
[1:41:23] again
[1:41:25] right about 3 or 4 hours later you're
[1:41:28] want something to
[1:41:30] eat
[1:41:32] right they thank God for the rain we
[1:41:35] just received you remember what I said

[1:41:54] move I don't ask him anymore that way
[1:41:58] sure I ask him for rain because we need
[1:41:59] it but I ask him to let me preach the
[1:42:02] gospel to where some of you can stand up

[1:42:14] rain so I want you to see God right I
[1:42:19] don't have to see him believe him right

[1:42:24] abundance of what most people will ever
[1:42:26] see but
[1:42:28] yet I want to see a bride right that
[1:42:32] will take God's word Y and put our
