Expo seminars in 2000 year 2000 we started doing it I can think of at least a hundred denominational congregations that have been led to the message go to God and just in the last two weeks that's before we came over we have been deceiving updates reports from evangelists but a little solo and the others of whole congregations there's a wave of Baptists and taking place now to the point that better by the way the things that by the solos turned into a it's like a fish now because it's always in the water so praise God so over the years we let a lot of church churches to the message but now it's time to get them established in the word and we're in the process of doing that at least next night we read in the book of Acts chapter 16 verse 5 and so a word the church established in the faith and increased in number daily are we not writing a book of Acts again in our day and then brother branham's desire express it to the insync taking side with Jesus he said get training in your own groups other ministers men that you see that has a calling in their life for the ministry we don't believe in Bible School but we'll even we believe in training training in the message and we train the ones that we already know God has a call in their lives amen huh we don't believe in mama called Papa sent preachers and Bertram said train them young men and bring them here to the elder we're thankful for the elder here I mean medicine which I considered to be my elder and this is what's been happening in our country next slide and it said but Wemmick's expressed this and a church of this faith can be set there and which will be an outpost in India outpost in Germany outpost in Switzerland why right now we should have had them all around the nations where I've been and the message then from there comes to another from another comes another see what I mean he was he was trying to show us how the message would grow and it it's happened all over the world now and it's happening in in a small waste ball away in the Philippines now because different regions in our countries message message churches are sprouting from different denominational groups they they come out of their denominations and received a message next slide please and these are the main men that worked with me I listed the names there I could not do it alone you know brother but a Paget called me a young preacher yesterday I'm not really that young I'm almost 60 year old see the gray hairs and I have health problems and I argue meet with my wives sometimes you know because he doesn't want me to go into hard places no but I just couldn't turn down the invitation this the Lord opens the door and I believe God makes a way for us to open the teeth to enter the game and but I thank God for this young brothers other brothers that have burdened and they have the same vision to propagate the word and see these churches get stablishing in the world next and we saw the other ministers I would say right now I can think of at least 100 ministers that work with me in the missions even next so this is one of the churches in southern the guard Tagalog region one of the biggest church there there are about a dozen churches in the region now and what we did we hold the joint meetings like but we had yesterday in every region of our country we kind of regionalized the fellowship to encourage the churches next and this one is in Nueva Ecija that's a northern part of the zone this is a property it's a four acre property that's been donated to the work of the Lord and you see the blue buildings there those are accommodation houses for the campers the delegates that will come and attend the meetings and the believers are helping out to build this compound here so that we can have a place up north to hold the fellowship meetings and the conventions in our current in that in that part of the country next see brother Edward Seaga Malian a better way met him and his wife but the Edward was a Dean by Bisco when he heard the message and he readily accepted the message and got got kicked out by in this denomination kicked out of the church kick out of their home yeah so we had to hurriedly build him a small house so they can move to a place they are holding a Bible here that was done published by the new tribes mission is an American mission group what they do is they go to a certain remote area tribal areas where the tribes are and they stay for extended amount of time to be able to learn the dialect in order for them to translate the Bible in that dialect and in our country there's at least at least a hundred dialects regional dialects and they don't have access to Bibles they don't have Bibles translated in their own dialects but we thank God for the new tribes mission and brother Edward has gotten in touch with them and we can buy these Bibles for only $2 apiece there amen so we bought a bunch of them and distributed them to the tribes people we just bought a small amount or Bibles because not very few could read in those tribes you know there's very little literacy amongst them but this COPO is helping the tribes of southern southern polite allowing next these are tribal people you can see their you know darker skinned and to reach this place you have to walk 13 hours it's up in the mountain there's no other way to get there but to all next it's better by the edward holding youth meetings next and baptizing some young people next and other new converts in the message next how 2 years ago we gave him this motorbike but now it's broken he took it to the mechanic and the mechanic told him the sad news that he can't do nothing about it can't get it to work anymore you know so you just have to give him another one next by the edward helps build this tribal churches you know the lumber is readily available in this areas and sometimes all they ask is help to buy nails they don't have to buy the lumber but they need nails and i think we helped a couple a couple of churches by nails through this church next you believers being baptized in water these are new churches being established in the jungle their areas of southern allowance next this is the typical tribal church service see the dirt the dirt floor and the benches that's very typical in those areas and brother-and-sister press nelio lead new churches like this like this one in melaka laka it's a place in al-assad in Halawa next here's another mountain tribal church the Church of McDonald mainly unreached tribe of the tower power talk about bateau tribe tower but both times are to announce it but yeah it's it's hard to reach their people because you know having to walk 13 hours with your place next this is the training that we do amongst the it--is you know itís a little pygmies they look like Africans but smaller they come from the Pinatubo area and they come to our church and stay there for about a week and we do extensive training and teach them about the message next now this is the latest convert in Manila area of the mystery Expo seminar is a church pastored by Pastor Augie and it's in in Marikina area the church came out of a Pentecostal denomination four years ago next and these are the brothers I considered to be the leaders meet these are all ministers and there are the ones now helping yet the other churches the new churches get stablish in the world the butter butter Suisun sal de soutien in white shirt here is used to be number two in their organization he came out of the organization and now he fully received a message thanks guys this is an average Church in Palawan church service you see the dirt floor and the pews typical next that's me holding another convention in Pangasinan north of Manila about four hours north of Manila we hold special meeting once once a month for the churches in Pangasinan Turlock and the banget province there's more or less about 30 churches in that area next and this one is in Bicol Region Goa come very soon this one must was held in July of 2018 next yes the same meeting next and this one is in Baguio City or bada ad I forgot his name his surname but he has a big Network he's got a tell vision Network and a radio network that broadcast in the whole of the Sun Island Luisana Sh the biggest island in the Philippines and so he reaches many many people with his radio and TV TV programs and now he's very interested in the message and he wants us to come and minister to his church and video everything so he can he can air it to his television program in his own next now the funds that we used to build this church came from this assembly right here we originally planned to build a smaller Church but migration of 1,000 families into this new village prompted us to build bigger we faced challenges in building this church now number one is a persecution that the workers there get from the denominational churches you know in the beginning when we started out there were they were very willing to cooperate with us in evangelizing the area but when we started building this church they thought we were a big denomination you know Oh getting a lot of a big big support they they don't know what we are but praise God they they became so insecured and so they they met together and came against the message that they are they are fighting our workers there they actually put a stop to the construction of the building they the politicians they talk to them so that the construction will be stopped on the 27th of the month there's a meeting scheduled and our evangelists from our church will be attending and they're gonna be they're going to have a meeting to justified the continuance of the construction of this church so you help them in your prayers pray for them next yeah this this is not glacier this is lahar which is mudflow volcanic ass that came out of the mountain so this is brother hey soos now one of our evangelists and they they traveled to displace us to preach the gospel next this is the kind of road that we negotiate going to the area next this is an ayah chirps used to be Presbyterian church but they every one of them receive baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and they're now in the Messick's amen that's the pastor there to the right connects this is an evangelist from our church by the Gabriele oxalis and it's the recipient of one of the motorcycles that was donated by brother here amen thank the Lord for that so he does a lot of teaching for our aya brethren next yeah this evangelistic goose who got an his name is Jesus Isuzu garden and it travels with brother a bang all the time he helps brother Gabriele in reaching out to eight itis brothers to the eye test brother Gabriele and blood races work in remote areas to some ballast to start new works in the message next now this is a church that I started years ago in the 90s in Mindanao it's a place called char Gow Island it's a tourist island actually and in spite of the mark Marshall rule in the island that's one third of the country it's about one third of the country under marshal rule now because there was a a war worse that place against us in Chi Chi morale we Morales City and there were a lot of Isis elements that are roaming around the area making recruits amongst the Muslim community and so the president declared martial law in this part of our country but in spite of the marshal rule this church which I pioneered in the 90s continued to grow next now this is another Church that I helped start in Dubai its Church in Dubai there are more members in that assembly now over 100 people now in that assembly made up of 120 members from different nations of the world and there is a smaller all-filipino Church in the city there are two churches now in Dubai think about it Dubai is it's just separated by the border into Israel so I'm thinking this church now is represented by many nations of the world the Bible said this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the game in all the world and then the end shall come so after the Gentiles then it would go back to Israel again next now this is the wave of a baptism that by the liter so low but the litter so low is this brother here but a fish so it's in the water this is imbecilic City Mindanao this Assemblies of God Church received the baptism in Jesus name after a series of meetings conducted in their church in surah Gao su Mindanao huh amen I think we should press a lot for this next now all these ministers were giving them tablets these are cheap tablets P buying the Philippines made in China everything's made a child somebody somebody says a minister I heard himself in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the rest is made in China but at least they have a tool that they can use to study the message and they're happy about it you know this ministers they attended the last mr. Expo seminar that but a little solo standing on the right there conducted in mystic city Mindanao 15 of them received baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they went back to their congregation and talked to them about the message and we've been receiving updates that their congregation are ready to receive baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as a whole church amen next next okay this is that's me with butter Molina and by the little solo better by the TonyMoly now we are now doing Expo seminars and follow-up work in Mindanao we're a small revival seems to be taking place brother Molina has started over 60 churches this brother here started 60 churches in the Pentecostal denomination but but then by delito is relative to Belle Alito a cousin shared the message to him and he got gladly accepted the message and now what we're doing is we're taking the rounds going to this to this 60 churches that he has started and presenting the message to each what happened let me tell you as a short testimony about this brother money now let me know huh the minute the Assemblies of God got got wind got wind that but the money now is now preaching another doctrine the message of the hour he was called to a meeting and he was scolded in he was humiliated insulted before the people and the purpose of course was so the people will stay away from him and not listen to his teachings but what they did backfired on them because all these people now sympathized with his brother bail money now and they want to know what he believes so praise the Lord next yeah another group that just baptized that got baptized last week this was last week next and this is another group next and this another group next so but only the soul is looking like official always in the water but passing all these people Amen praise the Lord to that name Amen next yeah that's better Molino and his brother brother francisco molino he now takes care of the church the new newly established Church in Leyte of 20 families thanks more people getting baptized next now this was the Expo seminar that but a little solo did in big logistics City so 15 of these ministers they accepted a message the rest of them they're fighting the message so hard now next now this is the latest harvest this brother along with this congregation decided to be baptized with these members next week so I'm still waiting for the update on this late latest development next this is the church in Hong Kong we have a church in Hong Kong and they're growing as you can see I'm the only male in the picture so when ministers come and piece for us I have to caution them but not to say brothers and sisters if there's no brothers all sisters to see but but there are strong witness for the message of the hour amen this church has become a springboard in reaching countries in Southeast Asia like Singapore Malaysia China Macau Vietnam in Japan next this is our December camp meetings have you been to our meetings better wait no November we've been to the November meetings right okay okay but we want you to come well maybe better some can come and minister to our meetings because about 2,000 believers gather from different churches I would say 30 churches are represented in this camp meeting every December Christmas season next that's the balcony of our church you know we use every space so that the people can can be accommodated they sleep on every space available in the church next concrete yes concrete and well sometimes they use a mat sometimes we use every space available for the campers to sleep next so we built this section in our fellowship area which was used last year by fifty-fifty believers to sleep on they slept on that register that we built next and this is a brother that builds guitars so what what I do I financed him you know by the material so we can build the guitars and we give the guitars away to the new churches that need them you know this brother's name is better cities Mendez from the island of coram palawan he's making guitars for brethren we gave out 40 guitars to new churches this year glory to God amen next that same working and next that's another brother painting the job doing the finishing next I think this is the last light happy recipients of guitars handmade guitars $40 yeah 40 US dollars per piece and so we thank the Lord for all these open doors in our classes it's beyond me you know I don't know how we are able to cope this ministering and helping this little churches in our country that recently visit the message thank you thank you Jesus now that didn't take too long well that took away from the message this afternoon that's all right amen I'm going to Minister about a subject which I call praying for perfection of others it's interesting that Paul made mention of a co-worker in the Lord whose name is Epirus we'll go to it in the next slide cloche in chapter 1 verse 7 to 13 I believe a paparazzi represent the bride of Jesus Christ you will find out data why in verse 7 to st. Paul writing to the Saints in Colossus he said as she also learned of apparatus our dear fellow servant servant who is who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Paul called him a faithful minister of Christ who also declared and to ask them and to us your love in the spirit now listen this is all he did Epirus he declared to st. Paul and the others the love that the collusion people have in the spirit and look at that the effect of it on st. Paul verse verse 9 for this cause because of this report because of what he did for this cause we also since the day we heard of it do not cease to pray for you this is the effect of what a purpose did we do not cease to pray for you and to decide that you might be filled with knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all mine according to his glorious power and unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son this little report prompted st. Paul to do all this for the Saints in colossal amen what a wonderful ministry this is in Colossians chapter 4 and verse 12 Paul said about a paparazzi paparazzi who is one of you it's a believer like just like one of you and said a servant of Christ I just want to be called a servant of Christ salute you always and what did he do he said always laboring fervently for you in prayers this was what I professed did laboring fervently for you in purse that ye may stand perfect and complete in the will of God oh my what a ministry to be able to labor and have that burden for the people that maybe are new in the faith or maybe weak in the faith or maybe are facing all kinds of challenges in their spiritual walk but it doesn't condemn them it doesn't look down on them but instead he Labor's hard in praying for these people so that they can come to perfection oh my what a wonderful ministry a lot of times we think of our own perfection you know this morning we had a great time we understand that we can rest in the Lord Jesus Christ because we are perfect in him right and better Brennan was caught behind the curtain of time he was told that nothing short of perfection can come in there hallelujah therefore you and I need to be perfected in order to be in the rapture you know in order to be in that dimension we're better been was caught up in hallelujah but a lot of times we we tend to be more individualistic so to speak in our walk with the Lord you know it's like to each his own we think of our own spiritual welfare we don't think so much of the other people's welfare and their progress spiritual progress in the Lord but I think a pop press here showed us a very good example because it doesn't think of just his own perfection he labels a lot he prays a lot he was burdened for the people that needed to progress in their walk with God hallelujah amen I believe we should all do that I believe this this this is the mission of the bride now to help one another lift one another up amen help one another in prayer because you need to be perfect to get there I need to be perfect to get there which means you have to help me out hallelujah because even though you reach perfection and I don't and I'm part of the body of Christ as well as you are there's no rupture you're not going anywhere you're not going until I'm perfect so you might as well pay for my perfection and I can pray for your perfection hallelujah thank God for a preposterous use the meaning of the name Epirus the meaning of the name is actually lovely isn't the bright lovely the body of Jesus got the beautiful bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it is actually a biblical baby name believe it or not mother's name their babies a papayas and it has this meaning it has the meaning covered with foam yep a press means covered with foam and I think of baby proofing a room or a house you know what we baby-proof the house we cover everything with foam so the baby will not get hurt so a bad price is somebody that's covered with foam meaning he's not sticky meaning he doesn't hurt anybody I mean it's not an offensive person but he's a gentleman he brings the word in the spirit of love and in wisdom he's a gentle man covered with foam foam pop press also means she knows a pop I mean she knows and later we're gonna coat brother banner were better BAM said she knows what needs to be done with the word the bride knows hallelujah you see we tend to be individualistic in our walk with God but no man is an island we need other people to help us attain perfection even the ones that are seemingly in their walk with God you need them so that your faith can be perfected so it's a challenge to be an a professor to see other people's desire for perfection and labor impair that others may attain it it's not an easy job because Satan will try to derail your every effort to help another it is a lot easier to be selfish and think of your own spiritual growth and perfection it's easy to do that like if we're honest you know when we pray and take the percentage of our prayers where we pray for our own needs we spend a lot of time praying for our own needs it's about time you pray for others also hallelujah now the reality is you can't make it without me well would you like to shake hands with your neighbor there and say you can't make it without me you can't make it without me - well pray for me pray for my perfection hallelujah because Bertram said the bride will be a complete body he knows exactly who will make up the bride of Jesus Christ and it will be a complete body he said there is nobody can add anything to it or take any from it if you would it would be a freak body of God if there's something extra or something lacking it would be a freak body for God of God it would have maybe like six fingers of one hand on one hand and three arms or something to add something or take something away from it and be one arm short or one finger short but it's the complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also and this to our one Christ and the bride they are one Christ as a body he lives in his body and that's us we are the body of Jesus Christ now amen we are we are the mouth the speaks his word we are the feet that brings the gospel to the people hallelujah we are the Word made flesh today his amen hallelujah it means the bride will not be complete without you whereupon we even said God is that complete without you you're special nobody can take your place you know the nose cannot decide that I'm not a part of the body because I cannot see no the nose is needed it's got a different purpose every one of us they we have a different purpose different ministry to accomplish in the body of Christ hallelujah were all needed it's a complete body we need to have the mind that the mind of price in Philippians chapter oh that fat chapter - that's my favorite chapter in the Bible because it says let this mind be in you which was in Christ why because he left his glory in heaven and became a servant hallelujah in verse 4 it says look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others what what is this verse telling us it's telling us to put the needs of others before ours our own needs when you pray spend more time praying for other people's needs hallelujah I heard a sunday-school teacher say when I was a child attending a Sunday School in church no real joy is to put yourself last and Jesus first and the others in between that's Jay or why put yourself last Jesus first and the others in between let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus hallelujah in 2nd Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 for we are glad when we are weak and you are strong this was Paul speaking on behalf of the ministry but we may be weak but that's alright as long as you are strong and this also we wish Paul is wishing your perfection you see Paul was not desiring his own perfection there's nowhere in the Bible he says I desire my own perfection but he wishes the perfection of others and I believe but a better deal that this is the purpose of ministry is to help the people of God amen got to where they ought to be get to their proper place in the body of Christ amen help them mature amen do the best that we can to to minister to them so that they can progress in their walk with God hallelujah better Bentham said you know once you lose the feeling for the people it's time to leave the ministry what's the purpose if you cannot sympathize with the people if you don't have that desire to be able to help other people not help yourself but help other people hallelujah when you belong to an assembly or a church you can't help but be engaged because the church is a community of believers a corporal body enjoying corporal grace there's grace for everyone hallelujah and if you are involved in other people's lives it becomes natural to be concerned and help in any way you could and what better way to help others done by praying for them Birnbaum says eternal life is living for others the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life this is how brother Branham defined eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others I say amen to that it proved it when it came in the when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others once you receive eternal life you start living your life to benefit other people hallelujah you become a minister a minister is nothing but a servant hallelujah and our example is the Lord Jesus as much a 20 verse 28 says there even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister listen and to give his life a ransom for many that's our example ministers and laity alike that's our example hallelujah that's why John 3:16 says for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him will not perish but have everlasting life that's John 3:16 now our part is first John 3:16 first John 3:16 says hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren living for others hallelujah he lay down his life for us we owe it to him to lay down our life for our brethren hallelujah brother Branham said this is the secret of my success he mentioned the success of Billy Graham he said it was prayer people paid for Billy Graham that's why so many people come to his flock these meetings and he was able to go places and brother Brian said the same thing about himself he said when I first started with his claims here I told my church stay on your face and pray God begins to move first thing you know I heard calls coming from Africa from all over the world how did it get there I don't know he said prayer went up pray he says believe when you pray that's it believe this is what the Bride of Christ should be doing praying hallelujah even the prophet of God depended on the prayer of the people he knew he was helpless without the help of the prayer of the people hallelujah in the next slide first thing for life he said that's the success of my meetings he was attributing the success of his meetings into this it's because real godly people pray for me oh my Oprah passes we need them hallelujah real godly people pray for me that's it that's the recent success for the success in my meetings when I come in and introduce these things about the visions and things there's a many old mother and dad sister brother setting out there that believe that with all their heart and the Holy Spirit drops right down them then if they didn't do that I have no way of doing it no matter how great it would be for my so it has to be for you the same we have to do a unit two of us barbam said we have to do a unit together two of us together to make the contact with God he said you as a believer and myself as a believer I like that we're in this together hallelujah it's not just ministers you have a job to do the old sisters that maybe are retired and maybe are of just having health problems and they can go nowhere they have all the time in the world to pray amen all of us we have our proper place in the body of Christ hallelujah and in the same s message thirteen thirsting for life he said we need one another more now than we ever did meet each other is now when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different now listen better band saw this kind of attitude amongst believers when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on dangerous ground right then keeping away from charts hallelujah find the one of your choice meaning a church of your choice assembling where you can come and feed on the word and grow spiritually find the one of your choice and remain there be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a Christian there we've got fellowship and Byram said protection people love you and pray for you they thank God for our assembly this is our protection amen the prayer of one another is our protection hallelujah that's the reason better Branham says when we disfellowshipped we take him out to the protection of the church we don't pray for him anymore we turn him over to the devil because fellowship assembly we thank God for this church because uh our fellowship with one another is our protection hallelujah I propose Paul called him a fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus of course you know what that means a prisoner is helpless he can't do anything but what the what you call it a warden warden tells him to do or allows him to do hallelujah we can't do anything but what the word Christ allows us to do and very Brown said that that day on Calvary it should become a second nature to us the unselfish life and self unselfish life should be should not be a second talk not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so alive in Christ and so walking in the highway that these things are just an automatic thing it becomes automatic to you to become selfless and think more of the needs of other people before your own needs you just do it not saying well now the Lord would the Lord want me to do that it's not that you're just part of him his Spirit is in you and you act the way he acted I do get it we discussed it this morning it's called divine nature it's just in you you don't have to manufacture it if the Spirit of God is in you it becomes a second nature to you and I usually gets a person's spirituality on his selfishness the more self is a person is the less spiritually progressively becomes the more matured you become in the Word of God the more selfless you become all right it becomes an automatic thing to put the needs of other people before your own needs hallelujah it becomes in the second nature to you now here's the code I was telling you about spoken words the original seed burner BAM said here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done be the word the meaning of the name upon us is she knows the bride knows because she's got the mind of Christ the word is in the bride and she's got the mind of Christ to know what he wants done be the word he don't have to be told by a deacon by the minister by the pastor he knows what to do with the Word of God hallelujah he has she has thus sayeth the Lord and then it is germanized so that the Holy Spirit water said until it's grown and it serves its purpose hallelujah were we should not be afraid to pray I should spend more time gray leather bottom said we can eat too much we can fellowship too much but we can never pray too much hallelujah Matthews chapter 7 verse 7 verse 7 through 11 says ask and it shall be given to you 1 what a great motivation motivation to pray and you ask something of the Lord to be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that asketh receiveth and everyone that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom his son asked bread will he give him a stone or if he ask fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give you good things to them that ask him you see a brother that's maybe immature in his Christian life hallelujah you should ask in prayer for that brother to move on with the Lord amen to be - to go a step higher in his walk with Christ hallelujah and if you ask it in prayer you think God will give it to you it's the promise God will give it to you hallelujah we must ask in faith first John chapter 5 verse 14 and this is the confidence that we have in him that we if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us not only he asked and received not because she asked amiss that you may consume it upon your own lusts why do you ask amiss how come you ask amiss John James said so that you can consume it in your own lust you're only asking for your own needs what about the needs of others hallelujah you need to have the mind of Christ you need to know that there are other people that are there also part of the Bride of Christ but there they're not maybe in the same level as you are in the Lord and you can't ignore them you can't be indifferent to their needs you need to do the best that you can to help the brother or the sister because this is the mind of God this is what the bride should be doing you should know what needs to be done with the Word of God help team or frames here we're gonna read crisis the mystery I said don't despise a brother who who is a little wrong if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sisters say Lord let me never have a root of bitterness spring up because it will affect him and it will take Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him run him from the Tabernacle here and it will kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it will do everything see so don't do that the church in his condition bourbon was talking about an arrogant and hostile spirit I think all of us at one time we had this attitude we had this spirit I remember the time when we first conducted the expo back in 2000 and we were receiving very little response a lot of times no response at all and the response that we're getting was rejection because you know in the beginning I gained knowledge I gained a lot of mysteries knowledge of the truth in the Bible and I grew in knowledge but the Bible said you need to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ right knowledge should grow no grace should grow with knowledge hallelujah because but a lot of us we grew in knowledge but not in grace and in effect we became very self-righteous we have taken this attitude of holier than thou and we can't hide it from people you know we were trying to share the message to the denominational people and they could sense it that I feel superior to them you know I didn't even go to a Bible School attend any seminary training but I felt superior to these people because they didn't know the mysteries and you can't win people that way you can't win people we can't we'll win people when they could sense that your attitude is I can't learn anything from you you have everything to learn for me I know it all that was our attitude in the beginning but God was gracious and he asked me as time went on we learned how to be to become one with the Ministry like this brother Molino here he was driving a motorbike the organization gave him a motorbike but he was living on $30 a month stipend from the organization can you imagine that $30 a month and he had to push gas on the motorcycle and his wife was taking care of 40 children in an orphanage put up by the same organization and he was given another $30 a month so the two of them together $60 a month and they're working for the nomination and the spread of Molina was saying you know I'm doing this with all my heart you know I'm doing it for the Lord but no matter how I how I try to deny it I feel that I'm doing this for people I'm doing this for the organization not for the Lord I'm being exploited hallelujah and you know right away when when we say denominational ministers we think they're well supported but they are not well supported not all of them are works well supported like this brother and so when we will realize that we started building our relationship with them we started to become one with them in our purpose of getting the Word of God to the people help them with Bibles help them with finances then they started opening up to us that's when the churches started converting to the message and mass as a whole congregation so now I can think of more than a hundred churches now from denomination that have converted to the message because we change our attitude hallelujah we got down to their level and became one of them and we sympathized with them we felt what they were feeling we understood the challenge that they were facing hallelujah and that's when we gained they gained we gained they gained our respect or that way around hallelujah don't be like they octopus in third John chapter 1 verse 9 to 10 I don't think I have it yeah we're lead us read that first paradigm said God you sweated it out for us the Holy Spirit come down convinced people that they were wrong they were sinning their spirits were arrogant they become hostile Snoopy know-it-all not willing to repent not willing to forgive people that's done things against them there wasn't willing to but today the Holy Spirit took the Word of God and place it right in their gentle hearts and said now do you want to come back to where you was the first time you come to the altar come back to where everybody you love everybody and you love me with your undying love then just rise up he said and come to the altar and they did it Lord oh I want to be an app prappas I don't want to be a deal trapeze the octopus John said of the octopus I wrote in to you the church but the earth Epis who loved it to have the preeminence among them receive it as nah there's somebody that wants to lord it over the other believers he was the church boss at that time self-appointed church boss hallelujah who loveth to have preeminence among them receiveth us not and ver for if I come I will remember his deeds with he do it John was exposing him because he was practically malicious words and not content therewith neither that he himself received the Brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casted them out of the church hallelujah who would you want to be at the Europe s who wants to lord it over the other believers or Anne APRA Paz who was a faithful minister servant of God who labored hard and prayed for the people so that they can be perfected amen amen god bless you a purpose of this day hallelujah let's sing that song make me a servant me the mystery musician come make be a servant today hallelujah I love the door I love this message it changed my life it changed my way of thinking changed my perspective in life hallelujah it may be like Christ hallelujah and that's this is the purpose of the whole thing the whole ministry's the purpose is so that we can all be like Christ hallelujah pray for other people's perfection not just your own perfection but think about this because even though your perfected and the others are not you're not going anywhere we all need to come to perfection make me a servant make me a server humble and me lord help me lift up those who are weak and may the prayer of my heart always be make me a server make me a server today he made me a server humble and me Lal help me lift up those who are we and made a prayer on my heart always be make me a servant make me a servant to day [Music] hallelujah how many of you would like to pray for somebody help my brother help my sister think of somebody you think is having a hard time in the Lord and pray for him right now hallelujah dear God I pray for this assembly you've done so many things through this assembly Lord in a foreign land in the mission fields and I know that you will reward them for what they've done the sacrifices they've been doing and now their hands are raised their hearts are open before you realizing that we have come short Lord we only think of our own spiritual maturity sometimes we become indifferent or people that are not in the same level as we are spiritually but we think of them right now the people that miss church a lot of times people that have backslidden people that are faced with problems we think of the single mothers that are maybe having having to have two jobs just to earn a living for their family and to fight the challenges that they're facing we think of the homeless we think of poor people hallelujah that they're having a hard time to make ends meet we think of the people that have a desire to be closer to you but just can for many reasons but father we pray for them just like a pop press prayed for the perfection of others hallelujah and like brother Branham said may we always give a good report about one another and not to notice all the negatives all the misgivings of the brothers and sisters but to only say good things about each other hallelujah we desire one another's perfection before you door may you help us help the ministry in this church may be with us we thank you Father may your mind may your spirit be in us hallelujah and be our guide and our leader as we await for the day of we return we thank you and praise you know Jesus wonderful [Music] we did all of you would take brother Addison
