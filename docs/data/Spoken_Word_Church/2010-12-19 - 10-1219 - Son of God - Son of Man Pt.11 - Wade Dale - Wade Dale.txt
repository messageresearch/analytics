TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thingy. And oops, that ain't going to work. Yeah, me too. [Music] All right. Help. Genesis 3:15. Look at that. [Music] Ma'am, I hold it this way. I can't see it. All right. Genesis 3:15. Thanks again to Brother Joe for taking over last Sunday while we were recuperating from our long journey. [Music] But in Genesis 3:15, Genesis 3:15, we're just going to kind of run through what we've been doing and and then uh bring it to the season because last time we talked, we were talking about Nimrod in Genesis 10 set up kingdom. But we don't want an earthly kingdom. We need a heavenly kingdom. The earthly kingdoms will all pass away, but this one will not. And that kingdom that was marred in Genesis, God came down in Genesis 3:15 and he didn't say, "I'm going to send soand so to do it." Which we know he did through Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, right down to Jesus, right down to the pro prophets, and right down to you and I. But in Genesis 3:15, God stood alone and said, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, who?" The serpent, and between thy seed, which was what? The serpent seed, and her seed, and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. All right? Now what happened was God knew that the womb that he wanted to come through had become polluted. Eve Eve had had the relationship with the the the beast which was not a snake. He was an upright creature between man and the animals. And uh it was a uh it was a happening that did not it did not scare God. God knew it was going to happen and God alone was the only one because remember over in Genesis it was on condition. If you'll eat this tree everything will be fine. If you don't eat of this tree I mean if you eat of this tree which is the wrong tree then you're going to suffer these consequences. So it was if you will I will. But now in Genesis 3:15 it says look it says and I will put enmity. Satan didn't do anything to the human race except mar the womb of Eve to keep God from coming the way he wanted to come did not stop the plan of God actually unfolded more the plan of God because God right here was God Elohim Lord God right here he wasn't a savior right Right. That's right. That's right. He was. But right here, he wasn't. That's right. You know, the day before this happened, he was not. He was Jehovah, God, God with a family, Adam and Eve, and getting ready to bring all of us forth through spiritual multiplication. Right? He wasn't a healer cuz nobody needed to be healed, right? He wasn't alpha and omega. You take that wrong. I guess maybe somebody on the internet maybe, but but that's the truth. Right. There was no way for him to bring those attributes forth the day before this happened. That's right. Right. The day before Satan done what he did through the beast with Eve. And then Eve took it to her husband and said, "This is the way we're supposed to do it." And he didn't kick her out because she was part of him. Right? So he said, "Well, I'll," In other words, I'll take on your what you did. All right? Not to save her because Adam's not a savior. Right? Now, God has now become a savior. I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed. In other words, I'm going to allow you to come through the womb of a woman born of your parents and between thy seed and her seed. Now, a woman doesn't have a seed. Woman has to be given a seed. Right? Everybody understand that? A woman does not a woman cannot conceive and give birth by herself. Now, in this modern technology, you say, "Yeah, they can." Still takes a man's seed. That's right. Right. Right. She cannot get pregnant by herself. There has to seed come from somewhere in the world that a man has produced to put in that womb. So, so it is not woman alone. There is a man involved. All right. But says between thy seed and her seed. So what's he going to have to do? He's going to have to come down and put something in this person to bring forth himself. Because when he says, "I will put enmity," which is a division. But what's he going to do between thy seed and her seed? It shall bruise thy head. In other words, he's telling the serpent, "And thou shalt bruise his heel." Thou, the serpent is going to bruise the heel of man. But this seed of the woman is going to bruise his head. In other words, Satan, take away sin, take away death, and all those things at the Calvary. That's what he did. All right. So that's the first promise of grace, right? In other words, he didn't say, "I'm going to come down and this will happen if Abraham will just believe." No, he told Abraham, he said, "I'm going to do it." Right? I'm going to do it. Now, God, that's what I said about predestination. Maybe one day we'll preach predestination and turn all the tapes off because actually predestination is there's nothing you can do about it. Right. That's right. Absolutely. There's nothing you could do about it. Tell me how you going to birth yourself. That's right. Right. Tell me how you going to make your way back to God. No way. No way. So God had this whole thing planned out and this is the way it's going to happen. But by fornowledge, knowing what we would do, that's why he could plan it that way. So we do have a choice. But we didn't make a choice getting here. Did you have a choice getting here? No. Uh-uh. It was God bringing you here. You couldn't say, "Well, well, now I'm bride, so my mom and daddy got together and had mem." Come on, people. Millions of sperm and millions of egg during conception comes down. How in the world is that one germ and that one egg going to find itself and bring you? God had to do it. There's no other way. That's why brother Ram said predestination in a in a shallow group of people. Then you would go home today and say, "Well, I ain't got no choice. I can just smoke, drink, do what I want to, and God's just if he saved me, he saved me." No, he knew you'd say that when you got here. Therefore, he could do that. So, predestination is really predestined. It's destiny determined before you even walk in the door. But to an untrained group, that's what you'd say in your mind. Well, brother, you're telling me I just go smoke, drink, cuss, and do what I want. No. If you smoke, drink, and cuss now, you're not born again. God ain't nowhere in your body. Amen. Nowhere. Cuz he will not dwell in an unclean vessel. You come to church all your life. That's right. And die and go to hell. You can actually quit smoking, drinking, and cussing and still die and go to hell. All right. But God has placed a part of himself. He set a part of himself aside right here. I will put enmity and I am going to come down into this woman called Mary and I'm going to create me a body that I'm going to come down and live in. Now folks, that's predestination. That's right. Set, done, finished. Because remember, in God's mind, it's done anyway, right? We're the ones that have a problem. So see that's why brother Brown couldn't in a very untrained group of people he could not say well it's just predestination and that's it. No he have to bring in fornowledge of what you chose to do. Therefore God saw what you choose. So he comes back remember it looks back looks back right to what you were what you had done. And then God looking back to that or to that forward and then coming back and living a life through. He put everything right where he could bring Sister Johnny. He knew she'd want it. So he took this man that probably never knew this woman from California or wherever. It doesn't matter. And one day, guess what? But don't you think God had that in his hand the whole time? The seed and the and the egg he had in his hand the whole time. Now, he didn't place it in there because remember right here it says between thy seed serpent. So we got to be born by sex. We got to be born this way. Amen. God didn't place an egg and a sperm in your mama and you came forth to make you no some special something. No, don't think you some special something. We was all still born in sin, shaping an iniquity, spouse from our mother's womb, a liar. Except for this one man we're talking about. That's right. And that's Jesus Christ. That the world thinks, you know, was born next week sometime. That's right. That's why I kind of brought this in a little bit. But Genesis 3:15. Now, let's go to Isaiah 7. cuz we're still talking about son of God, son of man. Because he's the son of God right here in Genesis 3:15, that's the son of God, right? Because he's not son of man. Son of man is God in human flesh. But now the son of man attribute is in him. The healer attribute, the savior, the redeemer, all that attribute is in this man right here. But he has not displayed them yet. Just like when you and I were born, we were born with the capability of fathering and mothering children. But now at 7 years old, you couldn't do that. Why? your body wasn't ready for it, right? Well, see, Jesus's body wasn't ready yet. We have to look at it that way because remember the Bible says the Godhead can be explained by the simple things we say. We were born withever capacity to bring forth children. But we had to mature to a place to our body could handle it. That's right. Right. Jesus the same way. Jesus could come couldn't come forth right here in the garden. He had to wait all down through these prophets so they could prophesy and say this is going to happen and this is going to happen because brother Brandham said what? The prophets in the Old Testament built the body of Jesus Christ. That's right. Right. Because of what? The word. Not because any sex or any seed or this. No, it was the seed word of God coming down through time. And then he said right here in Genesis 3:15. So all of a sudden way down about 4,000 years later, there was a little girl named Mary. All right. So now Isaiah 7 and 14. Here's the here's the promise. Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Now, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name, Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. See, Jesus had a choice. Excuse me. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou haveest shall be forsaken of both her kings. So, remember God uh Jesus came while they were under rule of uh of Rome. All right? But behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. Now, who is that? That's the son of man, right? The son of God is before he turned. The son of God is where we were just talking about in Genesis 3. So, we're not off our subject. Genesis 3:15, the son of God, that was spirit God. That man did not have flesh on him yet. Not the flesh of Jesus. He wasn't the flesh. He wasn't the flesh man, son of man that come down to die to save the world. All right? He may have come down and spoke to Adam and Eve in a body of flesh, but that wasn't the body that died. They had to be a literal body come and die. I was reading brother Brandham yesterday morning at work and um he said he said that body with our sacrifice just like I've always preached. The body was the sacrifice. That's what came and paid the price. He he said there had to be a sacrifice and he came and that body was the sacrifice. But now that body is the body of God, right? Okay. Now we know it was the body of God from the beginning but it had to develop. See my dad carried me inside of him for for 19 years till one day in holy wedlock I was produced but I was in his body couldn't see me couldn't talk to me but there was a desire for me to be here. That's right. So what did God do? He put them together. He put the man and the woman together. And guess what? Here I am right here. Okay. Then now I've got to make a choice. See, that's the part you got. You got to make a choice once you get here. But God saw the choice you'd made when you got here. So he predestined the whole thing. It's really simple, but it's very complicated if you really don't listen. That's true. Cuz you'd really think you have no choice at all. But no, it all comes from your choice. Right. You got to remember God knew everything and then he backed up and went through it. Right. All right. So it is destiny determined before you get here. But that destiny is determined by what he all what he saw you do once you got here. And there's no way to change that. No way. That's predestination. That's where people say, "Well, okay then. If I always were drunk, I guess I'll No. God, if you say that, then that's what God saw you say. So he didn't have you there to start with." When I look back, I can see my dad died at 14, which put me in another city, which had me the husband I met, which allows me to come to this church. Excuse me. Absolutely. And this is the most important time in my life aspect of what happened in your whole life. Absolutely. That's why it's hard. But the Bible says you got to forsake father, mother, sister, brother. That doesn't mean you deny them. It didn't say deny. Jesus said forsake. In other words, if mama don't come, that don't mean I can't. That's right. If husband don't come, that don't mean I can't. Jesus didn't say do away with them. He said forsake. In other words, you don't have to cling to them if they don't cling to the word of God. Cuz the word of God is the most important thing in your life. I believe if you'll live the word of God, God will give you your children and give you your husband, give you your wife. I truly believe that. Right. Okay. I just got enough grace for that. All right. Isaiah 9. Oh, let's go back to 14 just for a second. Cuz that word Emmanuel, that was God coming down in a baby because it happened through the womb. God had to come through the womb, right? Because the pollution was in the womb, right? Of Eve, right? Mind first and then the womb. So, what does God do? He comes through the womb. But he had to get it in Mary's mind first because remember Gabriel come to her and told her all these things. She had to in her mind she had to accept that. Right? And when she accepted it, it was done. Finish. All right. For unto us 9:6, for unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. This is not the son of God. He's given us the son of man because this man's got to die for us. This man's got to be our savior. This man's got to be our healer. You say a different man. No, not a different man. Same man. Different aspect or attribute is being displayed. Just like I told you before, those of you that's never met me before, you say, "Well, I know you're human. But now, when I identify this as my wife, you'll say he's a husband also." Then when my grandchild, so you don't know me as a grandpa, but when my grandchild comes walking through the door, you're obviously going to know that I'm a grandpa. So what did I do? I didn't change who I was. That's right. He just changed your way of thinking about me. That's the way God is. God don't change. We have to change our thinking. That's why the denominations believe father, son, holy ghost. They believe in three separate person, three personalities, three gods. There's a God here, there's a son here, and there's a Holy Ghost. There's a little floating cloud over here. No, it's the same man, right? Just like me. I'm the same man. And I just told you three of my attributes. And that doesn't matter all the other things you know hunter, fisherman, all the see you display your attributes by what you do. So now he can display these attributes by becoming a son. Unto us a child is born. So he's got to be born in human flesh, born through a woman. Unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and the name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace of the increase of his government. Now, in my Bible, his is it atalicized his government, right? Because Jesus is going to tell Pilate over at the crucifixion, he's going to say, Pilot's going to say, "They say you're a king and you're setting up this kingdom, right?" Jesus said, "If my kingdom were here, right, my subjects would fight." He said, "But my kingdom's not here." Right? In other words, my kingdom's from above. Right? Okay. So that's what we'll we'll stop right there and kind of cut a little short. But in Matthew, that's what we do. We express our attributes because if you drunk or whatever, you're expressing your attribute. But if you're a Christian, you're expressing your attitude. Everybody is going to express who they are. Whether you want to or not. Somewhere along in life, even Christians, even going up the statue of a perfect man, something's going to happen that's going to show you, well, maybe I don't have enough knowledge yet. That's true. And and truly up the statue of a perfect man, I don't believe it's like faith and then you put it in a box. Virtue and then you put it in a box. In other words, I've already got that. You know, I need three I need seven pairs of of of u seven shirts. Well, I got a white shirt. Well, I don't need a white shirt in the morning. No, you going to need a white shirt the rest of your life. Like faith. A lot of people say, "Well, you know, I got faith. I don't need more faith. Let's work on virtue." I think you work on all seven at the same time. That's true. I believe that. And then God somewhere down the line is going to let you realize, click. All right. You got that one. Click. All right. You passed that test. It's like somebody said one time or say, "Whoops. I got to take that test all over again." Because you know that you're you you know you goofed up. But uh let's remember that God didn't wasn't born on December the 25th. I was talking to a girl the other day. She was my auditor and we went out to eat and she said, "What do you think about uh Christmas?" I said, "Well," I said, "We know Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day." And she proceeded to tell me the whole story. She had just went back into history. She's just a rank. She's just a center girl. She don't go she don't go to church anywhere. She said it come from a pagan uh holiday that the Roman Catholic Church set up. And she told me whatever day it was, she'd went back in history. She said it's plain as day that it's the sun god's birthday, the shortest day of the year. And they bring the shortest day of the year in. Well, they wanted when see after December the 22nd, I think it is, the um the next solstice starts, which is I guess the win, but it's going your days are getting longer. See your days get shorter till December the 22nd, right? That what? That's going down, right? Then what? Resurrects. The sun comes up on December 23rd and starts a new time of more hours and minutes in the day. Well, what they done is took the sun god's birthday, which is the round disc, that wafer that they give the people on their toes. She went through that whole thing. And I said, "Sister," I said, "You know more Baptist, right, than all the denominational religions in the world. You know more just by reading history than they'll ever know." She said, "It's just," she said, "Just put in just put in son God and put in son of God. Put in Christmas origin of, man. It'll just it'll just" And she said, "It's a pagan holiday." I said, "I know." I said, "But we do it." I said because you know we I just like this time of the year just the way I am but I like to give things and get things. So um well it says blessed he that gives. So y'all just give all you [Laughter] want. Now I want you to be blessed. Amen. I want you to be blessed. [Music] Hello sister. You better get started. But now that brought the son god see to the son of god which has nothing to do with it. Okay. So we know Jesus wasn't born on December the 25th or whatever they 24th whatever say it was but we know that something did happen when that person was born. He became the son of man. A man that could be God in human flesh and live like a man, die like a man, but be almighty God in human flesh. And that's exactly what he wants this new kingdom to be. He wants a man in human flesh to walk in human flesh to be a human being but to be God made manifest. All right. Okay. Let's turn this off so we don't
