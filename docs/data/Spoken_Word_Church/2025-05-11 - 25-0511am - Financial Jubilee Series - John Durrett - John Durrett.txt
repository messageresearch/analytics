I may need you brothers to get this in uh presentation mode here for me. [Music] See, we will get this. Brother Anderson, I may need you, brother. So, yeah, I want to get this in in presentation mode here. We did it last [Music] time. Yeah, we try that. I do it. I miss [Music] things. It's one minute. We'll get it. We'll get it right. [Music] Okay, getting close. [Music] Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. All right. Well, that's five minutes. We'll go faster. Amen. So, we're going to continue talking about wisdom. We started that last time. The wisdom, wisdom to be free. And certainly honored by God's grace to have this opportunity again to present this Sunday school. And you know, financial jubilee, as as our prophet was just saying that that message that was on, press on. Keep pressing on. And everything that we're doing for the Lord, keep pressing on. Amen. Financial jubilee. Those things that you've learned and heard, keep pressing on in those things. You know, again, as talked about, we have testimonies and challenges that that's right here in this church of of us pressing on as brothers and sisters in Christ. And the pattern that we see in financial jubilee, it's just the same pattern. It's the same application in all areas of your life. The same application, the same pressing on that we need in the areas of our finances. We need that in the areas of our family. We need that in the areas of our faith. We need that in the areas of of fitness, mental fitness, mental stability. We need that in all of the factors of life. It's the same exact principles. And when we talk about wisdom, it's about hearing, recognizing, and acting. You know, that's when you really get into understanding. You don't really understand if you're just hearing. It has to be a recognizing what what is what what are we talking about? And then that has to go further where you're able to act on what you hear and what you recognize. You know, financial jubilee. uh my son, he's a good example, you know, and when God started showing me and my wife about finances and and all of that, you know, we were playing Dave Ramsey on the road and and finding everything we could about managing money. It was new to me and they would hear it. Oh, I'd be so excited. I start telling them about it and they that's all they heard driving back and forth, you know, Dave Rams going at it and I'm like, man, it is I didn't know this existed. And I try to tell them and I'll get ideas. All right, guys. y'all going to earn your chores and you got a glass for saving, one for giving, you know, and um one for spending. And we tried to teach them and they were hearing. Okay. And then, you know, they were doing well until they hit about them teenage years, you know, about 18. John like I hear that, but I hear other stuff, too. I hear that, but I hear this. Daddy, do you hear this? You start hearing other things. So, now he's getting old. He's getting more mature, right? But he's hearing so many different things. We're just one of many, many voices. And it's the same for all of us in all areas. There are many voices speaking to us. How are we going to recognize the voice that we need to hear? So slow enough, he starts making different decisions and you know, just different decisions than I would make. And um still I'm still trying to get it out. Are you hearing? It's going to cost you. It's going to cost you. Can you recognize what I'm saying? Slowly starts making decisions. Things start going differently after a while. First, it's good. It's Hey, it's good. He might be doing better than dad. You know, you know, we used to hear the the older generations used to tell us when we was coming along said, "It took us 30 years to get this." And of course, the young people like, "Uh-uh, it going to take me a year. You watch. See me." You're like, "Okay, okay, young stuff. You'll see. But sure enough, he started realizing and started learning from some of the lessons. And then slowly you see him starting to recognize, wow, financial jubilee does work. It is the way to go. My now he's preaching to me, Dad. Yeah. I heard this guy on YouTube saying, "You just do it with cash. Just do it on a loan. Don't spend your cash. That's foolish." Amen. Amen. It's recognizing and acting. And that's what God wants us to do. When we are able to hear, recognize, and act, we will see God in motion. I thank the Lord that he's he's a God that rewards. He's a God that shows you. He'll show you the next step. If you're able to take that one step, he'll show you the next step and reward you for the step that you took. That's very important because we need to see. We're human beings. We need to see. And if you can do it in finances, he'll do that in every area of your life to show you you're walking right. It's not easy, but he'll show you. Hearing when the trumpet sounded, every man could be free if he wanted to go free. That's the word. It's hearing the word, hearing. But then there's a choice to it. If you want to go free, recognize his lord said unto him, "Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou has been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. enter thou into the joy of the Lord. Why do you want to go free? Why? That's the question. That's what recognizing is all about. You know, back in the slavery time when they came and said, "Hey, you're free." Some of the slaves didn't take that. This is talking about the African-American slaves, they didn't take it. They were used to being on their land. It was a difficult thing to go free. Some of them would say, "Why do I need to go free? I I got my food. I got I got what I need. Why do I want to go free for I don't understand. And many of us when we hear the go word of God, we hear the gospel being preached, we don't know, Lord, what what what do I need to go free for? What is it all about? Well, God being in the rewarding business, he's saying, if you're able to be faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. So, it's about dominion is about what his purpose is. In the Garden of Eden, he wanted us to subdue and have dominion. That's not going to change. You know, there's a song and it says, "Walk around heaven all day. When I get to heaven, I won't have anything to do." Well, I don't believe so. I don't believe that. I believe we're going to have a lot to do in heaven. Because in the Garden of Eden before the fall, he said, "You need to subdue." It was things that Adam had to do. And if we're going to be ruler over many things, there's things to do. So, here is the opportunity for us to get ready for those things that we're going to do. We don't know fully the picture, but it's things to do. Amen. And he's trying to prepare us here. So, it's a goal to be faithful over every area of our life. Faithful in these things that he may make us ruler over many things and enter into the joy of the Lord. Amen. That's our desire. So, that's recognizing why we need to be free act. Then, we need to go on and train and fight. We have to be doers of this word, not just hearers deceiving ourselves. That's it. We want to hear, we want to recognize, and we want to act. God has everything good for us. Everything that he has for us is good. It's all good. But we have to train and we have to fight for it. He says as we hear the word, when we hear this, we are free from sin. We are free from shackles. We are free from habits. We are free from smoking, drinking, carousing because the son of God has raised from the grave and has broke every feder. All condemnation is gone. The debt has been paid. The penalty is paid. The sins are washed away. And we are free. Oh, we are free people. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. And we're free from all that the devil would try to do. We're free. That's the same freedom those slaves heard. You're free. The sun is coming up today. We're free. Amen. Amen. And those who recognize what it meant. My I'm no longer limited to this plantation. The sky is the limit. My generations to come were free. I get to go and build whatever God has for my life now. Not what my slave master has for me, but what God has for me. I'm free to go pursue that and put in the work. Just like Esther, just the same thing. You're free to fight now. You're free. You don't have to let Mori come in and destroy. You are free to go and fight and defend yourself. We're free. We're free to cast down smoking, drinking, carousing these things that pull on us. These things that try to hinder us. We're free. That's God's part. He has done his part. He has paid the debt. We're free in Jesus name. Thank God for his part. Praise the Lord. Our part. And I'd say come, you got something to do. God just don't poke things down your neck. You got to believe it. You got to do some fighting. Amen. We got to believe and we have to fight. That's the only way. God's part again is to sound that trumpet. And it's our part to put it in action. Put in place what we're hearing. This word of God, this is one of my favorite quotes. Covers everything. Clean your lives up. Pay your debts. Oh no man. Jesus said, "Get all things off your hands. Get everything right. Make ready. Get ready. Remember, in the name of the Lord, something is fixing to happen. That's more than ever, my brothers and sisters. We're living in the time. We're living in it. We're living in it. Make ready. Get ready. My, it's so much to say just about us making ready, getting ourselves together mentally, physically, spiritually, everything. Anything could happen at any time. And this is not a a scare tactic to scare us. We have the word. We're special people. You know, God has always sent his special kings and queens, prophets. You look in the Bible, they were there to help them, to tell them, to set them on the right course. And we have the same thing. God has sent us a prophet to us to help us navigate where we are to let us know what's going to happen. We see it happening right before us. Yeah. My my my you know yesterday I was actually preparing for this this Sunday school and it was in the morning praying and earlier that morning you know I was just sitting there thinking about our prophet and I was thinking about California you know I was like my we know that thing is going to sink you know one of these days and I I thought you know how how is it going to be you know we've seen what co did and you know how the world and this big world that we thought was so big can just change in a matter of huh that we never even imagined it could. We thought it was too big that everything could be restricted everywhere, every country. My we saw it and I said, "Man, you know, California, that thing sinks. You know, the internet may be gone. What? We have built an infrastructure on the internet, man. You know, all your money in the bank account, you can't get to it." I said, "Man, all of a sudden, you know, military to go to the store and shop, man, this thing is my goodness." And I said, you know, I want we probably, you know, maybe it'll be a rumble or something. You know, that's what I was thinking. I said, maybe it'll be a rumble cuz, you know, California go down, we might get a little rumbling on this side. And I was thinking about that and then I just went on to prepare the Sunday school a little bit after that. I thought it was my daughter cuz he's upstairs in the room. I'm like, she's up, but what in the world? I said, "Well, maybe it's a helicopter." And I was getting ready to walk outside cuz about 15 seconds, this thing was still said, "Well, man, maybe it's a helicopter. It can't be a earthquake. I never felt that in my life." Said, "Man, I went on bing." Brother Anderson, did y'all feel that? Don't tell me you felt it, Brother Anderson. I said, "Lord said, yes, brother, I felt that." My goodness. I said, "Lord God, man, what what season and time are we truly in, my brothers and sisters? It's it's like it's like, Lord, help us. Get all things off your hands. Get ready. Get everything might right. Make ready." That's just nothing but the truth. That is nothing but the truth. Do all that we can in Jesus' name. Amen. See the goal is for us to be efficient servants. Efficient servants in the Lord. not hindered servants. I love this quote. Our prophet said, "And we ask that you'll be merciful to us today and grant unto us the understanding that we have need of that we might be a more efficient servant for thee." It's our heart desire to serve thee with reverence and with a true heart, and that you might get the very best out of our lives every day. May our walks be so that you'll be well pleased with the things that we did for that day. My Lord, help us to be efficient, efficient servants for the Lord. Amen. That's it. To be efficient, to be ready, not not hindered and caught up in all kind of things. All tangled up, all trapped up, unable to be efficient. The devil knows if he can just keep us hindered, he has us. Our prophet says, "What happened to you?" Paul said, "You did run well. What hindered you?" See, back there you was free from that stuff, but you wanted to be like the rest of them. What's happened? You did run well. What hindered you? It's become so common to you. You believe it all, sure, but it doesn't thrill you anymore. It's so common. God's so good to you and you don't realize it. My my my my my. You can see you can see what the devil is doing to us in this this time. His goal is to hinder us, hinder our walk. You see these two pictures here of this plant and this one plant has a rock on top. Our prophet said a stick or rock something falls on that thing. It it's a real genuine plant. We're real believers. We believe. But the devil has done everything to get our eyes looking at everything else. Everything else to make what we hear so common to us, you know, and yes, this is a new time. We've never been where we are today. I understand that many things have happened over the years and that's part of the journey. You know, I was telling my wife, you know, when God first got a hold of us, how how excited, you know, we were young, young young people and God changed our lives and man, then you start getting responsibilities and houses and cars and kids and different opinions, different ideas. People come, you know, you see a pastor may pass away, a family member pass away. That's the hardship of life start coming in, you know, and and all of a sudden, you know, man, you're you're seeing so many different things. people leaving this word, people questioning the word, all these kind of things challenges you as part of the tests and trials. That's part of this journey to put us through to see are we going to hold on to God's promises or is it just going to become common to us? My goodness, we are seeing the word of our prophet fulfilled in our day and time. We're seeing these things. Yes. Now, we have to keep a balance. Of course, we got to keep a balance until we know. We don't know. And that's just the truth, right? But that don't mean we're not pressing on and doing everything we can. And that's what cleaning up your lives is all about. It's about giving God the opportunity. You can see him in the small things. And he's ready to show us more and confirm more to us. We're ready to handle it. Amen. We have to be able to handle what God has for us. That's why we have to be faithful over a few things that he can add more to us, more revelation that we can handle. Amen. We can't run off and and then we're on the wrong track. The devil is looking for every opportunity to question our credibility in this word. What we don't know, we don't know. And that's just that. But what we do know, we do know. And that's a blessing to know that. And what we have is not common. And we don't need to take it for granted. God is good to us, our families. He's been so good to me more than I could even say. He's been so good. And I thank the Lord for that. Amen. But these hindrance these things looking at the rest of them we got internet temptations and all kind of things that challenges us in our walk so much we can see. Amen. Achen you know he got hindered by lust. Brother Brim said he hindered the entire battle. Hindered the entire battle. The 10 spies they got hindered by circumstances. We're not able to take it. David got hindered by distractions. And us, we're hindered in Lady Osia. We got all of those things, circumstances, distractions, every lust, everything you can name is aimed right at us. Amen. And what we have can become so common. So common. But if we can just reflect that God has been good to us in his wonderful name. That's why we need training. That's why we have to have training to act. We have to have the training to be able to act. Christian training. Colossians. I think this just kind of spells it out to me and what I'm sharing is all about as I shared in the last part one in Colossians Paul says to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colise and then he goes if you read that chapter he's talking about how faithful they are and how loving they are you know they they've heard and they fa their faith in Christ he's talking about that how the gospel came and they're producing fruit he's saying all of these wonderful things about what they've been able to do. But then he goes to verse 9 and says, "For this cause, we also since the day we heard all of these good things, we do not cease to pray for you and desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding." He says, "Hey, I'm praying for you. All of these good things, but it's something more that you need." And I see that for myself. I see that in the churches. I see that that we need more because we need that we might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Verse 10 starts describing why that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. He started telling you a little bit about what this knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual understanding will bring. All the things that we need so we can walk worthy. So we can increase in the knowledge of God. So we can be fruitful in every good work. We can be strengthened with the Almighty. My goodness, that's exactly what we have need of, my brothers and sisters. That wisdom from the Lord. Proverb Proverbs 3 breaks it down a little bit more. says, "Proverbs 3:13 says, "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom in the man that getth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She's more precious than rubies, and all things that thou can desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are the ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone that retainth her. Proverbs 4:5, "Get wisdom, get understanding, forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. Love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principle things. Therefore, get wisdom, and with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her and she will promote thee. She shall bring thee to honor when thou does embrace her. Wisdom is the principle thing. It's the main thing. It says it will preserve us. It will keep us. Keep us from what? Keep us from the pitfalls of this life. Pitfalls. That's the unsuspected hidden danger that's everywhere. That's in everything that we're living in. That's in Lady Yosia. That's what it is. Wisdom will keep us from those things. We need that wisdom in Jesus name. Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. As we kind of close up here, knowledge, it's what gods want. It's the facts and the information from God and his will. Wisdom applying what he wants. It's the skillful applica and practical application of God's will in your life. Your life and understanding is why he wants it. It's the complete picture. is hearing, recognizing, and then acting. That's the full understanding. Wisdom is the actual application. You can watch YouTube. I have watched YouTube many times to learn how to fix something. And I get out there and it's, man, it seems very easy to take this whole piece off of this car. Matter of fact, they did in two minutes. Sped it up. Done. Wow. I'm ready. Get out there with my tool set, man. Fancy tool set. Get in there. getting that screw. Yep. Man, my screw happened to be rusted. My goodness. That's where wisdom comes in. It's practical application. I heard it. Seemed very easy. Five minutes, I'll be done. Saved me about a, you know, good $150. 3 to four hours later, man, it's going to the shop. They got a shop for a reason. Yes sir. My son started speaking to me. Dad, your your hours cost money. You've been out here four and a half, five hours. You could have saved that. So wisdom is the practical application as we apply God's word to our life. The hardships that's there. Your personal situation, your personal difficulties come into place. Your patience, your background, your history, all of that. It's very different from just hearing You have to now apply it. Some of that application may be, yeah, you need a little longer on your knees than maybe that person. You know, that person started with a little bit more than you had. You started with nothing. You started with two of your parents are divorced. They have a history. So, what may seem very easy to them may be a lifetime of prayer for you. Their grandparents could have left them a ton of money. Your grandparents could have left you in debt. Everybody has a different situation. And as you apply it, that's when it becomes practical to you. Lord, help me in my situation. I need your wisdom in my marriage. I need your wisdom in my situation. I need your wisdom with my kids. My kid, all I look at him one time, he'll stop and start crying. This kid, you whip him 10 times, he still ain't crying. He's telling you it don't hurt. You said, "Lord, help me." You need his wisdom in your situation, my brothers and sisters. That's the practical application of what we're hearing. The song leaders, song players can come on up. We just thank the Lord. We We need all that God has for us. Last quote here says, Proverbs 2:6 says, "For the Lord gives wisdom. From his mouth come knowledge and understanding." The word says, "I have taught thee in the way of wisdom. I have led thee in the right paths. Wisdom from God leads us in the right paths of our lives. There's two paths we know is a path of righteousness and it's the evil path. And God has taught us in his word. He's taught us. We've heard the word. We just need his wisdom to apply it. And we need the training to act on these things in areas of our life where we don't have wisdom. The word says, "Thank God for this word. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upgradeth not, and it shall be given him. James 1:5. We can ask God. And I think it's such a time as this to ask God. We've never been here before, none of us. It's time to say, Lord Jesus, give us your wisdom in our whole area of our life and give us wisdom where we are today, this season. everything we see happening. Lord, we need your wisdom how to navigate where we are for our practical living situations in Jesus name. God bless you.
