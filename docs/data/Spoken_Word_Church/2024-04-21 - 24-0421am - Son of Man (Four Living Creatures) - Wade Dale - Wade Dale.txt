bless you good to have you here good to see all of you here we got a bunch out today and um I think um Sunday the ministers took my um what I said the heart I told them I said I'm not going to ever stop them from going out preaching well they're all gone now so and I told the sisters this morning I said all the brothers are gone I said we going to have a sister meeting one day cuz all y'all came to church but um good to be in the house of the Lord we're going to have a baptism today whether it rains we're going to pray that that rain stops when brother John gets done this afternoon when the Lord leads him to to dismiss we going to have baptism we going to pray that the that the rain will not happen anymore while we have a baptismal service but we're going to have it anyway all right after the second service little sister IA June which is named after my wife June uh she'll be baptized um this afternoon after brother John finishes we have brother John with us this afternoon and I told him I said you stay gone long we'll put you to work song leading preaching putting to work just for a moment um if you want to have your seats just a minute I want to U um we had the men's meeting Sunday and and we kind of hash some things out but I just want to go over a few things that I want to uh to let your sisters know cuz some of you don't have husbands and I want you to know that we appreciate all of you and that we will be not there will be no changes as far as anything immediate until July except now brother Bob is accepted the role of assistant pastor of the church so he will be the assistant pastor today starting forward all right I believe you guys are comfortable with him and I'm comfortable with him and I'm comfortable when I'm not here I need to feel some kind of comfort so I and not that the other ones are not well I already talked about all this but um but brother Bob's done a a wonderful job and and um absolutely has grown a lot in the Lord I remember the first time when U I approached him he was teaching Sunday school class and I approached him I said you know you might want to try to put something together you know and and um and this was when Dad was still pastoring the church and I said uh cuz that big man up there may ask you one day if you'd like to say something I said you better be ready and he was like oh he his palms sweat y'all y'all shook hands with him Lord I thought we was going to have a baptismal service right there just off of his hands but he was so nervous but you see he's grown and that's been you know 10 or so more years ago that brother Bob's been preaching the gospel we sure appreciate brother Aaron and brother lis also they're just they're they're good soldiers and I'm looking for another one I need somebody else to step up and we'll have a few more we send you out somewhere else but uh uh we we know for sure that um brother Terence and brother Ryan are are deacons brother Bob wants to step away you cannot um give up your post you can just be inactive so brother Bob uh since he's now going to be the assistant p p and then since he will still be doing Sunday school here he's asked to step away so I'll be looking for a couple of deacons and um Mom and I were talking the other day we talking about deacons brother Brown said deacons have a more stringent qualification than a a preacher a pastor because they supposed to be married and supposed to have children a pastor doesn't have to be but a deacon needs to be married with Children to qualify for being a deacon and apt to teach and take care of widows and orphans that's what the Bible says so um I'm going be looking for a couple of deacons there also Brother Gary and brother Dar our trustees I'm going to be looking for one more there just to take some of the load off of some of them and we know that brother Donnie brother collie's board of directors and Terrence is the president we've set up as a corporation years and years ago so um but just wanted to make sure you understand this and also for your Sunday school teachers brother Bob will not be the superintendent anymore brother Ryan will be the one so if you have to be out you need to see brother Ryan when if you're out now brother Bob will be doing Sunday school here and he will be responsible for getting his own replacement all right but brother Ryan from from brother Michael all the way downstairs you'll need to see brother Ryan about getting you a replacement if you need to be out all right is everybody with me on that all right I'm just kind of trying to go over just a few things just to make sure that that some of you sisters understand that U what kind of went on a little bit and um also we want to make sure that you know that brother Dale's going to be taken care of he's not going to be put out to dry he's going to be taken care of he's took care of this church we're going to take care of him and that's including my mother too okay so we're going to make those decisions though later on in July we're going to wait till July to see um if I run anybody body off or if uh you continue to stay here but I'm going to continue to work I'm not going to quit so I'm going to continue to work and because I have good insurance at the post office and I can get off when I need to and um that will take a burden away from the church because uh at my age my u u insurance would be $1,000 a month and I pay 240 a month at at the post office and it's really good insurance and remember Sister Jun May the 21st she's going to have her hip replaced so remember her for that um and also we've set in place some things that in case I become incapacitated that we know what to do right and um if you need to ask that you can ask the deacons or or the people that were here uh also um let's see we're going to have um addition of leaders and which will be Deacon and um and trustees uh we're going to start having quarterly meetings but we'll talk about all that in July we'll be meeting with the heads if you have any questions any your sisters have questions about anything see one of the deacons or myself or one of the ministers we were all here but we sure appreciate all of you we appreciate your support we absolutely appreciate your support we're going to continue Mission work just that is what I mean just we're we're pretty much staying status quo until July and see what's going on see how we're doing I don't want to U um I alarm anyone but but but seasons change um things change uh so we want to be ready for that to meet the challenge not let the challenge come and we not be ready for it all right and then we also talked about um over all the years brother Dale of course he never took all the tithes so he put money back into church all right and we would build off of it and we would do things with it well we may have to come to the season now to where uh I'd like to have a bathroom in that study cuz that's when you see me go out it's not to do anything but to go to the bathroom all the internet to know but there's not a bathroom over there and we'd like to do a little expanding but we may start a building fund we may start U asking you if you want to put the money in um like I said seasons change with Everything's changed the uh you always well as I do the Heyday of of of of having plenty is about over we could lose our jobs we could be persecuted there's a lot of things could happen that had not happened 20 years ago when we could do things now it is and I want to be very cautious I'm optimistic but I'm a realist okay I understand that that we can't do all the things you know we can't build a I wish we could build a $300,000 uh you know totally renovate the building and have plenty of room and plenty of downstairs and plenty of where you don't have to do that you know up there and the and the The Voice goes out and it hits that thing comes back but we're doing the best we can what we got as long as you pull on the word of God and I preach the word of God and these brothers preach the word of God that's the main goal all right it's the word of God is the main goal all right and as I told them before I have counseled with many pastors about different situations and I um I don't I don't talk to everybody but I do talk to pastors cuz I'm sorry I can't talk to my dad so I brother I pull off of brother Mike IG brother Chris long and brother Claude different ones Brother Scott they've been pastors for 30 years or longer so um I'll make mistakes and I apologize already because I'm human but I'm going to try to minimize them as we keep going on as church and uh as I said before if you didn't vote for me hang on give me a little time and let's see if you you like the word this the word first all right if I keep preaching the word of God then if I if I don't look good I'm sorry okay if I don't preach the way you want me to but it's what it's the content of what you say is is um is important it's the word of God it's and like I said before it I admonished all the people with with a job in this church be here be on time make an example set yourself to high standards because all the others are looking at you everyone is and looking at me too and I'll read you a quote here in just a little bit uh from the scripture yes from the scripture about a Good Shepherd so let's stand to our feet and God bless you uh remember July 19th 20th and 21st I know we got all these other meetings but we're going to start putting a um a thing up on the board and and like I said before we're going to try to find like a big Airbnb or something and then you may have to pitch in going to pay a little bit um to go but that's going to be at brother Andre heads it'll be Saturday Friday night no service it'll be just um food and fellowship if y'all went last year you you know what we're doing the 20th will be our youth service there brother um Joel Brown will be speaking for us at the same place at the Methodist church and then Sunday I'll be speaking at brother uh Andre just keep us in prayer if you want to go absolutely we'll do the best we can to pay what we can but if we ask you to pitch in a little bit like I said before um ask you to pitch in a little bit and help okay but we would love for all of you to go and um I don't know what we're going to do about service here I don't know who's going to can brother Bob had to come back and preach Sunday last year I'd like to maybe either find somebody or either put that one online up there and y'all watch it here we'll we'll we'll worry about that later but that's in July but we'll start looking at um places to stay and and food and all that so we just have a real good time of fellowship with him we appreciate him we appreciate brother Andre he's been down here twice um and he always stops bying and sees brother Dell so and they really appreciate him so just keep that in prayer let's bow our heads do heavenly father thank you Lord one more time we're able to stand before the greatest people that ever walked on the face of the Earth and father you told us that if we would we would listen if we would open our ears open the eyes of our heart as the song says that Lord to hear from you take take all the emotion and all the I don't like this and I don't like that but Lord you give us a word you give us a Bible you gave us the word of God it has never been changed it's plain and simple and father I pray that that plain Simplicity will be here today that you'll anoint us to do the things that we're supposed to do anointed this church Lord to hear from you father the great Shepherd as we're going to see in a minute the Chief Shepherd that's who we're looking for Lord I pray that you'd bless the ones that are not here all the ministers that are out in different places ministering ones that are not here that are sick different ones Lord doing different things father I pray that you'd bless them and bring them back together Lord later on this week father I pray that you be with us in the baptismal service that someone else may may come forward Lord and not just be little sister Iva but maybe there's a there's another one there that's thinking about it father well we pray that you would anoint their hearts Lord to uh to come and be baptized in your precious name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's who you are we love you Lord and thank you amen I like these two quotes I understand once again that the greatness of God always reveals itself in the simple things always we're looking for these great big things with fireworks and all that simple life lived is the greatest thing against the devil he hates a life that live for God he hates it and life with God is Not immunity from difficult right I've already said this before it's not an immunity from difficulties but peace in those difficulties we all go through them because we said before we looked at Smyrna and we'll see it in a minute that it means death and that there's just all kind of persecution going on in these different Church ages listen you've never had to fight to get here to a church service through policemen through a mob through a crowd and have to lock the doors to have service not yet these people had to these people in the Dark Ages if they just said we're a Christian they would be put to death amen but now we're able to be safe at the moment and be able to uh to listen to what God says to us but today we're going to kind of review and then go over something I want to talk about is four living creatures all right let's read Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest wrest in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and the age we're living in now leosa and I turned to see that voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlestick one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle and we know that's bride form all right Revelations 4:6 and you can be seated Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like into Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne now this is Revelations 4 this is this is after the Rapture remember we go up in 41 the bride does and this is a scene that John saw there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf or an ox and the third Beast had the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word now we understand that this is John after the Rapture took place in heaven a scene and he sees these four beasts with Lion they had a head of a lion calf or ox man and an eagle all right but we're going to read in Ezekiel where Ezekiel talks about the wheel and in the middle of the wheel and we'll see where he talks about the same identical thing he sees the same vision but he has a little bit different angle to it and we'll get to that just a little bit cuz I know all of you if you're Bible studiers and you know the the message of the hour those four Beast are the Holy Ghost that's the guards to the temple guards to the altar that Holy Ghost today is what guards you from doing wrong it where's the throne the throne's not out there Thrones in here there's no more wheels in the middle of the wheel wheel with the middle of the wheel was those going through the 40 years in the wilderness with the Ark on the on the cart the ark's not there anymore that ark's inside of you that's right all right is everybody with me so that lion ox man and Eagle those characteristics are in the Holy Ghost that's in you today but each age as brother Brown tells us we'll get to it maybe later on that in every age there was one of these Beast or one of these came to the Forefront I know brother Ryan asked many many years ago and he'll remember because it says there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now we'll look in in Ezekiel Ezekiel says that they never went backwards right all right okay and if you take a box which is you know lion ox man and Eagle it looks like they're going if if the man was going in this Direction all these other ones would going be going backwards the one behind but you got to remember God is so fast he's Eternal he's an eternal being and this is eternal these are living creatures and every time you need something that head turns will it turn so fast till they're never going backwards never going backwards they're always going forward and we'll read that in the Book of Ezekiel and clear it up maybe if you look and say w I don't know how that happened well if God wrote it in the Bible there's a way for it to happen all right so we have to depend on that but now let's remember that we'll go back to the church ages just for a moment we look at the mind of God today as we were as all of you this week were studying on the word of God I hope somebody did a little study and sometime during this week or thought about God or read a scripture or heard a message or or or read a quote or I'm sure you did from everybody else I ain't going to say Netflix I did but did you think about God if it was God that you were thinking about that was a mind of God coming to you I didn't need to be there the other preachers didn't need to be there you got to get this for yourself remember brother ran said it's not the preacher's fault cuz you don't make a Rapture it's your fault all right so don't blame it on the preacher all right everybody with me don't be calm let's have some excitement today so that message was sealed up though for all those three eternity and all of a sudden some kind of a a way God comes down and he steps forward and we're a able to understand him and it's called the logos or the speech God begins to speak but remember when he if he speaks there's got to be something said I mean there's got when God speaks there's got to be an action me and you we have what Idle Words half the stuff we think about half the stuff we talk about what never comes to pass that's right everybody with me that's right how many times have you formulated a a thought and you're like this is it this is it this is it that ain't it well God don't waste his time once he thinks and says it it's a piece that matches he's got somebody on Earth that's going to hear it but now not just one man though that's right like I said before even Columba when we get to that middle age Columba died before the age even began so somebody had to listen to what he said the message he had and was given from God somebody had to listen to that and it Quicken and carry on all right so we'll see that in the lion Ox of man and the eagle the first three Church ages are the lion are l i o n not lying lion Church age all right there was a lot of lying going on but that was on the other side so the Mysteries unfolded there was there was a mystery that was hid even from Paul come on somebody the hidden Mystery was the seals coming up here in lay out of s Paul didn't have a a revelation of the seals being open he could see things but he looked through the glass doly he he could see things but he couldn't see clearly cuz it wasn't time for him to see clearly now you and I in this age we must See Clearly that's why we must be held to a high standard all the time sir not just part time that's right all right and if we fall B that's Grace and you know who to find it from and where to go and all the steps to get Grace brother rown priest marage and divorce the grace of it for a purpose we needed it amen we needed it that's why he preached it cuz we needed Grace I'm glad it wasn't left up to me and you cuz we wouldn't be preaching Grace we preach condemnation judgment well praise the Lord anyhow thank God for Grace thank God he sent a prophet cuz God knew that we listen if if he sent Paul if he sent Moses let's go well back if he sent Moses to GR a writing of divorcement I'm not going to preach on marriage divorce just sit still but I make a point Moses the people must have needed it or God wouldn't give that Grace to Moses CU remember God don't do something frivolously he doesn't do something without a without a plan and a purpose so then Paul Paul comes and he says look at all these people you know he comes into Corinthians and he sees this this boy living this man living with his uh stepmom he said oh no wait a minute that ain't right right but he got a Grace because the boy got right and come back into the church amen oh boy we wouldn't we wouldn't like that would we huh thank you Lord but brother brandham comes God knew we'd get in all kind of Scruples and scrapples as brother R would say he says scrapples and he knew that we would need Grace to carry on cuz we got in brother R said misinterpret the theology right yeah coming from where right here that's right all those years that well that's okay and then no we need to somehow some way keep this thing clean yes sir but you got to have Grace cuz we're all messed up I don't care if you've never had a problem in your life you born messed up something had to die for you to get born again that's right that was the old you that older damic nature you were born with that's right so God sent Grace in every age but really in this last age he really sent Grace because this is the whing up of it no time to play no time to go to another another we don't look for another Messenger to to to straighten up brother brandham no that messenger came from with the mind of God just like we said that message was proclaimed and it was a distinct and declared message brother B tells us he says look he says uh in um um spoken words Original Seed he said I thought I preached it all I thought you know I thought I was just here to restore the gifts to restore order brother and then the Bible says or Bible then brother um Bram said the Holy Ghost said pick up your pants said as of yet Mal for has not been fulfilled in other words the seals have not been open the greatest Grace it was ever given to us is the seals when they open I said when they open not greasy Grace to do what you want to but if you get the seals right brother Keith Reed called me yesterday he's coming um the last Sunday in July before camp meeting but he had just got back from Uganda he had been there almost two two to three weeks and uh he was telling them about uh he I had went over there in 2007 I think it was and preached a week week long series on the seals how it was the Plan of Redemption not that it was just a white horse rider with the Antichrist and all that and he said still had those notes and he said I took them over there and he said them pastors when they got finished he said they told me they had to go back to their church and repr preach a lot of stuff we don't know what God's given us and I didn't preach it myself I got it from Brother what brother Dale had already preached back in the 80s 80s some of you wasn't even born in the 80s you see what God's done Among Us he's G us a message but this message goes everywhere it just doesn't right it's not just right here it's for everybody brother Keith always told Brother Dale he always told Brother Dell he said brother Dale you're not only preaching to those people in in Lula he said you're preaching of the world met people over there in Uganda that was that had listened to Us online so praise God thank you Brothers in the back I know we got we've had a lot of issues but thank God we've got what we got all right and we're working on some stuff to keep this all this from uh from not happening anymore so the true word of God it become there's a spiritual war now there's a spiritual war there's been a spiritual war in every Church age all right because it's true word versus false Doctrine it's not it's not whether you believe you know you're a Democrat or Republican it's the true word versus false Doctrine and we're going to see in these Church ages that in the first three ages it was the lion the boldness they would stand up and Proclaim there's only one God I watched somebody yesterday online it came up on YouTube it says Pastor explains to Trinity Heavenly days he held his hand up right here he said there's Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in the godhead he said then God made Adam Eve and children I said that proves the godhead everybody was how false can you be but you know what misinterpreted theology that's what did it that's why in the first church age that's why in the second Church age Third Church age you had Paul irenius and Martin that knew there was only one true and living God and that's what they preached but then you had those other people the false people that was trying to preach the same thing listen during Paul's age I may not get anywhere today but we're going to get this far Paul's age he would he preached about a an out resurrection and and then a group of people started preaching the resurrection had already happened according to what Paul preached right remember what Martin Luther remember in the movie you know they're burning churches and dragging uh people BR dragging the preachers out and burning the churches up and Luther say what are y'all doing they said we're doing what you said they misinterpreted what the messenger said have we got that in the same age now messed up the message is not messed up it's the people that are messed up that's in the message all right but it's always true everything even when even when Satan was created and he preached a false Doctrine to those angels every how many billions of years back listen you got to remember one thing eternity goes as far backwards as it does forward right we're talking we're thinking about oh and you know no it's always back there too but there's a time when Satan was created well when Satan was created he preached a false Doctrine to Angels they accepted him and it's been War ever since till today but today the battle in this age the battle ends yes right the battle will stop when the bride goes up in the glory for us for the Gentiles we think about these wars in uh Ukraine and Lebanese and the syrians and all these people I hope that doesn't frustrate you I hope that gives you a calm feeling that we know what's going to happen and we know who's going to be involved right brother Brown said watch Russia Russia and Iran are just like this that's right who do you think's fun in Iran Russia it's later than we think so the messenger then is laid away or taken off the Earth and we either accept it or reject it and then that brings a judgment or a plague like it did to the denominations when brother Brown said they're just lodges now if we believe brother R was a prophet then they can't go any further than being a lodge now they're filled up that they're filled up uh Joel Olstein 15,000 members um 6,000 members 4,000 members you know that's huge and they believe what that guy says absolutely that's how deceived that Satan has become remember where Satan seed is it's either in you if you're not born again you're not born again it's in you Satan is sitting right there today if you're not born again sorry it's either truth or false one of the two there's no in between that's right you could be heading toward something which I pre I I pray that we're all heading towards more of God yes sir all right don't just be discouraged you could be Sanctified you could be justified and Satan's still be there but you know that you can't stay that way you got to continue on things I used to do I do them what no more I wanted to oh I'm sorry I wanted to y'all didn't we're fine and that thing still pops up every once in a while that's right oh well pray for me okay well they many shaking their head but me and you just a couple of us so shake you you know amen a little louder shake your head just a little bit louder but we're all in that though we're all in a journey this is a journey this is a this is crock pot this is not microwave right we're in a we're in a but we're moving toward something don't give up Don't Stop well I don't thereare be care just just keep moving right what I tell you check the boxes come amen check the boxes you say you're too legalist check your box you can call me whatever you want to call me but I believe and if you're going to come to church you need come on time cuz you bring every devil in the world with you in here I wish there was a little water thing running down where just wash it all the way and we just walk in when we wanted to reach over and pinch yourself you are not in a dream you're in a fight all right but that mystery you and I have we've got a mystery that came from gone to a little Prophet so that so that brother randam would be not he'd be the one where wouldn't mess it up they wouldn't be three or four and they all get up and say well I don't believe no they sent us a prophet yes that Prophet told us what God the mind of God he told us that mind of God and you and I have got a responsibility to either do it or not there's your spiritual war but that mystery is unfolded and Paul tells us what part of the mystery is is Christ in you the hope of glory yes so then there was an age of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell that Lion of the tribe of Judah that first beast of the four creatures everybody with me it fell on the day of Pentecost and they come out of that what they were they were behind the door had everything shut for fear that they would be they W going to be persecuted by the come on people the Romans were not persecuting them it said for the fear of the Jews the Jews wanted them dead listen the people out in the world don't want you dead but religious people are going to kill us all if we don't take a Rapture I mean a body change religious people religious is what put Jesus on the cross absolutely Rome uh well he tried to not brother John he tried well I can't find no fault in this guy crucify him crucify him crucify him he just happened to yield to the will of the people which were Jews right so the Holy Ghost fell on a group of Believers and what's the first thing they did they bust the doors open as brother R said they run out into the streets and they're like man these people are drunk well 15 minutes earlier they were cowards there you go yeah so the whole Holy Ghost gave him boldness to speak the word of God Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ that was the beginning or the precursor to the Gentile Church age called Ephesus because remember there was an age of Pentecost Peter was a spokesperson there was no messenger the messenger was the Holy Ghost to the people all right it'll be important later on when we get to this the Ephesian Church age we know that Paul was the the um founder there at Ephesus at the church he pastored a little while and then he went and did Mission work and then John comes back John the Revelator he passers there until he dies we saw all the the characteristics of the Ephesian the very city of Ephesus is just like us now Rich increased with goods and all different things and Paul died around 6467 and the church age went on to 170 somebody I hope somebody get somebody had to carry that thing on and they didn't have MP3 YouTube they didn't have um recorders amen the only recorders they had was scribes and they I ain't never seen a scribe right that fast they get to preaching the Holy Ghost had to Quicken what you heard is there any different now no no well the only difference is is no wait a minute you misquoted that I got it right here not on this one but y'all got Apple raise up your hand if you got an Apple Watch raise up your hand if you got an Apple Watch don't be looking up quotes in church but I mean that's what you can do now but what about if you didn't have that what if you what if you what if me and brother Dar brother Dy brother Kylie listen to what brother Dale said for all those years and then we go sit somewhere and and we don't have the mind of Christ we we we formulate our own opinion I believe that brother Dale meant this well I believe brother Dale meant this well I know he meant this somewhere the Holy Ghost had to put that thing together regardless of paper right regardless of tape yes regardless of MP3 Apple phones that you can look up quotes regardless of that God's got to Quicken what you hear faith comes by no it doesn't come back Apple watches so all y'all are lost except in five people raise your hand up no faith comes by hearing do you ever ask the Lord to reveal what that man saying to you I do man when I first come back to church there in the late 90s dad was laying it hard and heavy and I'm like Lord I got to catch up but if you'll open up your heart not to YouTube but if you'll open up your heart to God and say God I am right here I'm not going anywhere I want to understand what this man's saying that's why a lot of people can't understand brother Dale they don't open their heart or they don't have the Holy Ghost right sorry cuz remember if the Holy Ghost is speaking then there's got to be a holy ghost to to respond ab and if you don't have the Holy Ghost how you going to respond now you can do like brother Luis he's not here today but he'll tell you he sat here he said for 6 to8 months and he just absolutely was brain dead right he never heard these things before and like those Brothers in Uganda they never heard the seals preached like that before we heard it in 1982 they never heard it this is 2024 and they got a listen voice of God don't need even print books anymore they sold all their printing presses they print zero books it's all in digital form now so but but that's great CU it's available to anybody we used to remember those little ebooks we used to buy and they were outrageous but you would take them and they'd wear them out cuz they really wanted to listen to what God Said through the prophet then they went to mp3s and then they went to that uh message Hub where you could print books out of one computer and that was great but now everybody's got them I mean those people overseas they're not behind I'll promise you that you know why cuz they're different than us L out of seean Americans they [Music] study a lot CU that's all they got don't don't ever don't ever go to a foreign country and think they don't know what you know but it took somebody like brother Keith though to place it together to show them that the seals is for the Redemption of their body and how the brother Dale preached it there in the ' 80s and we were absolutely fortunate to do that in 2007 I want to ask you a question remember when brother Dale used to give us quotes yes well everybody just hang on a minute you still got them you ever read them you even know where they're at I figured you did Brother Kylie some of you did too but but I preached that in 2007 in Jamaica and I took everybody a copy I went with a whole um suitcase full of what I had run off here it was like 15 pages cuz I did quotes charts graphs went all the way through the the statue of perfect man went through the four horse riders went through a little bit of Daniel 70 weeks and then got into the seals and it took to me it took six nights preaching 2 and 1 half hours a night they didn't care there we get to church at 7:00 that s till 8:30 most of y'all already asleep by then you're asleep now then we'd start service and i' I'd go and they' just say keep going keep going keep going and it'd be midnight when we get finished then they had to drive it I had to drive an hour Keith did an hour back home and they filled the church fall I'm not saying nothing about me I'm just saying listen somebody kept those notes right and they used them for the glory of God they didn't put him up somewhere they didn't tear him up they didn't throw him away it's like brother Keith said and I'll tell you just playing he said we don't realize what we've already got remember what brother um Andrew Glover said and it's a quote where brother B says I don't think we are sufficiently impressed with what we got and it's in the pergan church age I think we're we're we're not we're not impressed that this message is is just for a group of people that God chose before the foundation of world that we would hear this message and respond to it yes right we're not impressed I mean you but you can get a big head over here on this side let's don't do that let's be humble that God was that God saw that you would try yes I just want us to try to live the a good a good life and check the boxes and and stand still and wait on God Amen you read that thing right there y'all can see it I can't be still and know that I am God do you know he's one God do you know where he's at do you know what he's doing are you sufficiently impressed with what you got wow but God's give us a shepherd He that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth the Sheep hears voice and he cth his own Sheep by name he called you by name and led you out and when he put forth his own sheep he doeth before the goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice today I want you to hear the voice of God it's not going to do us any good to hear the voice of brother Dale the voice of way Dale the voice of brother Bob listen to what's behind that voice listen to the essence of what's trying God's trying to get to you I've always said this message is not in 1100 sermons written on a piece of paper our on magnetic form are now in your digital pocket it's the essence of that message that's going to live in a group of people amen and then that's going to turn and carry us in a Rapture but he's got to turn from you and carry it to the Rapture that's it how can you hide it under a bushel how can you hide it in Earthly vessels now God hid it in Earthly vessels which is me and you but remember who was it Gideon or somebody told him God told him put the candle inside the Earth and Bethel and when you got up shout and hit that thing and knock it out and the light would shine and they think there was hundreds of thousands of troops there was only 300 of them and they whipped like 50,000 fistin or whoever it was they were in a battle with because they broke the Potter and let the light shine you know I read a quote the other day where it went from Brother brown but was somebody else that said your light only really shines through the scars right amen your light only really shines through the scars you make a scar and there's light inside of you how did we get out of the side of Jesus a Roman spear cut him open and brother Brown said water and blood came forth he said that was the bride the releasing of the Bride praise God and it stayed open so that we can get back in remember Adam's got sealed up Jesus has still got the he's still got the scar and through that scar shines me and you through our scars shines the light to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out and he wh when he put putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers Hebrews 13:20 says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep so let's just take say today God is The Shepherd of all these sheep all right he's the great Shepherd he's the one that doesn't make a mistake through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant look make you perfect in every good work to do his will will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to him be glory forever and ever amen 1 Peter 5:2 says feed the flock of God this is where he's talking to pastors as myself and his brother Dale different ones feed the flock of God now watch which is among you taking the oversight thereof there's got to be listen we got I was talking Sunday there we're not an organization we're an organism an organism has moving Parts but there's got to be somebody that's got to be held accountable that's right then the next person held accountable then the next person held accountable everybody with me that's just the way God set it up he gave some Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelist for what for the perfecting of the Saints all right now look not by constraint but willingly not for filthy looker but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock amen and when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown not him you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away listen we're not going to be walking around with a bunch of crowns on her head right a symbolism of what's inside of you in your intelligence you know listen God knows whether you want it or not you just got to figure out whether you want it or not so let's look at these amen just for a minute we got a Pentecostal age Ephesus smna pergamus now I'm going to skip real quick because I want to I don't want to be too long today um but we we've seen the church ages we've seen Ephesus we've seen Smyrna Smyrna meant what bitter death I still want to read that cuz look in Ephesus look at all that light that was the preaching of the unadulterated word of God coming straight from Paul and Peter and James and John all the different ones right from Jesus the chief Shepherd had had just left am and it was fresh on their mind it was fresh in their heart they had not had as Paul said Grievous wolves had not come in right at the first it was a pure age a lot of light then look at the next stage a little bit more dark a lot of people accepted false teaching a lot of people accepted false Doctrine look they didn't accept it and say hey there's nobody I know of that says hey my Doctrine is different from yours mine's false and yours is true hello somebody they always say my Doctrine is true and yours is false amen everybody wants to be right but look at the next age the pergan church age the light's getting getting dimmer then in Columbus it almost goes completely out and we'll look at that in just a minute but I want to talk about the the U lonox man and eagle but the Smyrna Church age means bitter so what in Smyrna what happened brother R said look there's a twofold significance found in the name of this age it was bitter filled with death look the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on part of the false listen there start to be more and more persecution right yeah and who persecutes who Christians so-called persecute Christians that's why I thank God uh he sent us a prophet that said look bride will not persecute bride you can't persecute the Holy Ghost if you got it inside of you now if you don't have it you will persecute death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine now look even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God everybody with me that's a good quote you're no more alive you're no more stronger than the word that you take in that's truth now you take in garbage it makes you weak hello somebody garbage in garbage Gage out what we always say in the world garbage in garbage out that's seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament we saw that organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made rituals and that age started at 170 to 312 the messenger was irenius we know that let's just keep going here real quick now listen when we get to this when we talk about this morning the church age there is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back persecution no no he does not I know your tribulation not I'm going to get you out that's but the present suffering Paul said of this time is not to be compared to the glory absolutely amen whatever your flesh desires today will go away it'll either burn in hell or be changed one of the two amen absolutely amen we still believe in a burnt hell okay but what a stumbling block it is to so many people that's why that this Prosperity Doctrine and all these different things that yeah they got their place why because they don't have the Holy Ghost to combat it the only thing you got to combat false Doctrine is is the Holy Ghost absolutely the four creatures the four living creatures and listen we're in the end time all four Hallelujah are at our disposal the lion Matthew Mark Luke and John or or Matthew in that first church age they couldn't be an eagle they could have an eagle anointing God has dispensations we know that but you know have you ever thought about this though the reason we have the the reason God's segments this put something segments or dispensations is for me and you to understand it if he just flowed through and like you know I'm just no he says all right understand this that's why that's why I love these Church AG if you just keep reading them just keep reading what God Said in the scripture but that's what brother Bram said read what God wrote to all these and he gave that message he said this is a way you're going to act lukewarm BL to see blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it that's what he said every age got the good and the bad but remember in the Lan age we don't get any good it's all bad but he may commit you to death come on now he may commit you to death as he did Paul that's right he may commit you to suffer as he did job that is his prerogative for he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration I want to add that confusion also and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strengthened and settled yes listen I believe brother ROM said and I'm going to bring that quote where he says that when the doors of the Gentile Church Clos he said God will anoint a church then and God will do in one year what theologists has tried to do in 2000 look what we got coming amen there's going to be a time just for a moment just for a moment brother Joe God's going to show the world the bride that's right he didn't have to show her all down Through the Ages cuz they weren't as dark as this age right most deceiving worst day is this day and we're getting ready to go home and I believe God's going to uh you know we we've all got issues we all got things we got to work on but if you'll get in the right place at the right time be at the bus station have your bus ticket have your bus ticket not at the airplane counter be at the bus ticket check all the boxes yes ask God for Revelation yes amen God is going to show the world you and I just for a moment amen he's going to say there's where I've been there's where I live there's where I spend all my three and 1/2 years preaching so I could be in that group of people right there praise God and we know he's going to go to the Jews but remember they turned him down that's why they turn around and they say oh Lord we're in trouble cuz you know what those two witnesses are going to do they're going to go hey you see what that group there was a group fresh on their mind cuz we just go up in a Rapture don't you remember that group that called fire that group that had many people that were limping in the church didn't limp no more many people didn't have limbs brother R said limbs would be restored but it's all done for a purpose he said for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compare with the glory which shall be what revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made listen we are spoiled brats if we don't get corrected who said that's it who said that that's exactly right brother that's it we know for a fact if we had no control come on somebody I'm talking to Christians today if even if we have no control what will we do that's why I said you wait till you think it's lawlessness now and they'll just ride over anything turn cars over and you know destroy Walmart and all kind of stuff just over somebody saying a racial something you wait till the Holy Ghost leave and there's nobody in the United States that has the Holy Ghost in their soul I'm just talking about the United States I ain't talking about over under nobody will have a restraint Dog Eat Dog they'll shoot and kill each other they'll steal your food and not think a thing about it you said I said that's Christian so so-called you know what's holding the wrath of God away me and you cuz he's not going to pour wrath that he says he's going to pour out on them that don't believe him he's not pouring it out on them till he takes you home moves us over in a Master Dimension to let this thing clean off we're going to step right back into this Dimension we're going to be a marriage supper though we're going to take communion for 3 and A2 years and and find out who who made it who didn't talk about our Lord he's right there wipe all of our tears away the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne he wants you to sit right there with him in his throne not on his throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be what revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that's what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we're all tried and chasen his sons not one but goes through it the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God he I believe brother B was a prophet right okay all right the church that's not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God I'm going to continue on we'll let's get to this just for a moment I'll back up but I want to I want to talk about just for a minute talk about these four creatures just for a minute okay now what I want to show you is is we've come now we we're in we're almost getting toward the fourth Church age so we're almost in the middle of the church ages getting ready to come to where we have a whole lot of information with Luther Wesley and and Pentecost and brother brandom we don't have a whole lot from their back but thank God for a prophet that found it somewhere in the history and was able to pick the church age Messengers but what happened is God released these four creatures watching The Book of Ezekiel we'll go through this real quick and I'll get back with it next week I won't cover it all let's read right here Ezekiel 1 verse four now this is Ezekiel a prophet all right ezekiel's a prophet he's he's told to to he's going to go into these visions and for him to come out and tell the world or tell his people all right they with me and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire infolded itself I I was sitting here yesterday and and I don't say I got caught up in the vision but I've never seen it like this before where you just literally get it get caught up in this and that's what Ezekiel is looking at now listen Ezekiel don't have a revelation of who Jesus Christ [Music] is never seen him before knows a messiah's coming knows Jehovah's with him but never seen him before does it really know it's going to be in his people he just says Israel that's it but we know it's more than that and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great Cloud fire and folded itself and the brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof was a color of amber out of the midst of fire same amber colored light that was over brother brandom is the same Pillar of Fire with them back then but watch also out of the midst thereof now look out of the midst have we we've been preaching on in the midst of the golden Candlestick one lik un to the son of man but I want you to look at this real quick also out of the midst I want you to get caught up in this Vision don't look at words you're Ezekiel you're standing there and you're looking out into space and you see this Amber glow in this fire all right everybody with me all right also out of the midst thereof came the likeness now watch you got to really have a revelation to understand what he's saying right here out of the midst thereof came the the likeness of four living creatures hold on a minute lion ox man and Eagle that's what it's going to turn into but watch what he saw when John turned to see The Voice he saw seven candlesticks and in the midst of that candlesticks was like one lik un to the what son of man all right so here's Ezekiel in the Old Testament out of the midst of came to likeness of four living creatures so he looks and sees the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man son a man but he saw the lion ox man and Eagle cuz it says right here came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man yeah you and I today have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have those four living creatures inside of you but I see a man and sisters but I see a man and everyone had four faces and had four wings and their feet were straight forward straight feet and the soul of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass what does brass mean judgment and they had the hands of a man here we go back to that same man again under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings now remember let me stop here just a minute we all know the number three is what Perfection number seven is completion five is Grace and brother Brown calls four an Earthly number right right but now it's not a bad number right right that's right it's a number of redemption LS man an eagle justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word right and they had the hands of a man under the wings on the four side and they had their faces and their wings their wings were joined how about I did I cried when I saw this I was going to bring it down there but I didn't their wings remember I told you what the church Ages were they weren't apart they intertwined each other the real true picture should be that every one of them are spread out and they're all standing there in order one One Wing touching the other Wing One Wing touching the other wing wing One Church AIDS touching the other Church AIDS and there's your four beef and we'll see in a minute that you got lion ox man an eagle all right everybody with me all right so let's see if I can find this back down here again but I never really stopped and read this about Ezekiel till just the other day but when I when I looked at that picture their wings were joined one to the other they were in harmony they didn't have a break in their Doctrine their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they had four had the face of a man face of a lion on the right side talking about on the right side they had four had the face of an ox on the left side they four had the face of an eagle all right these were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one that were joined one to another and two covered their body and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went all right and they turned not that's what brother Ryan was asking how how can they turn not and there's four faces and this looks like there because if you if you'll remember the Ark of the Covenant set in one place right then you had you had three tribes here three tribes here three tribes here three tribes here you had Dan and the different ones and one was the face of a line one was an ox one was a man one was an eagle but in the Revelation you got to understand God's so quick he can turn and you never even know it cuz God don't go backwards and listen these creatures are not just attached to God they are God but it's where me and you can understand it amen listen sometimes I can't understand the Holy Ghost I don't know about y'all pray for me right I can't understand what he does sometimes but I depend on him telling me what he's done right you know what I ask him to God make me a part of that don't leave me make me a part of that if you're moving make me a part of that movement amen is that your desire make make me more like thee don't separate my wings right don't separate me from the Holy Ghost don't separate me from love if you got a problem get the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost depend on him who else you going to depend on give me a name that's what I thought somebody say Biden somebody say Trump garbage if they don't get born again they'll never see Heaven I don't care if they're the greatest people ever walk on the face of the Earth they're lost that's right and they have Mind of a lost person yes right and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was liken to burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps and it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning up and down Jacob's Ladder remember he saw angels ascending and descending ascending and descending am and the living creatures ran ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning we pray for somebody we we say send the Holy Ghost well by the time we say send he's already there hold on the Holy Ghost is a person y'all know that don't you okay all right he's in spirit form but he's still Jesus Christ all right okay I just want know if I lost you there for a second and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as I beheld the living creatures now here's Ezekiel looking at this scene behold one wheel upon the Earth by the living creatures with his four faces now he brings something else in he brings a a card in with wheels cuz that's his interpretation of Jesus Christ right amen the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's right as they travel along remember when brother briam said he said that brother but that God went and knocked on the door of of paradise and said Abraham opened the door and said Sarah that's the calf that's the man we fed the calf to he said Ezekiel looked over his shoulder said hey that's a wheel in the middle of the wheel his Revelation was though that he was in that Ark and the Ark was being carried by Wheels exactly and the living creatures were around him now now that's been done away with right we don't have oxcart it's inside of me and you that's why John didn't see that in the Book of Revelation he saw four living creatures we'll get to that just really quick and we'll get we'll touch it again next week the appearance of the wheels now there's an appearance the appearance of the wheels and their work was lik into the color of burl we'll get into that I don't have time to talk about that and they four look and they four had one lightning there's only one God that's right there's only one way to do this yes and their appearance and their work was as it was a wheel in the middle of the wheel what spinning God's moving all the time they might have stopped their wheel in the desert but God's still turning right when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went as for their Rings they were so high that they were Dreadful and their Rings were full of eyes round about them four and when the living creatures went the wheel went with them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the bride was lifted up too Lord listen what's Jesus coming back after he's coming back after himself he's coming back after himself made manifest in another form called a bride but is coming back for himself amen whatsoever the spirit was to go they went whether there was their Spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creatures was in the whe Jesus Christ when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in those Wheels and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creatures was at the color of a terrible Crystal stretched forth over their heads above now if you go back to Revelations 4 John saw what a sea of Crystal right it's pretty much the same scene it's just a higher Revelation coming from the Old Testament to the New Testament John saw Jesus he knew who Jesus was he knew Jesus was the Messiah Ezekiel didn't know that right but he was looking at the same pretty much the same scene all right and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other everyone had two which covered on this side everyone had two which covered on that side of their bodies and when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of Great Waters as the voice of the almighty amen the voice of speech sometimes all we hear is Wings fluttering but the there's a voice behind that if you're bride there's a voice behind that move listen and what are wings Wings are Made for two things to fly you right and for movement if they didn't if they didn't flop they wouldn't go nowhere so it's movement and when they when they went I heard the noise of their wings now here's Ezekiel he's probably heard thousands of birds fluttering but he heard something different he heard a noise he Heard a Voice the voice of speech as the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings and there was a voice from the firmament over their head when they stood and had let down their wings and above the firmament what is it above the sky that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne now that's what John saw right as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likess of the throne was the lightess of the appearance of a man the same one John saw one sitting on the throne in Revelations 4 Ezekiel Saw one sitting on the throne in the in the Old Testament and I saw as a color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within from the appearance of his loins upward and from the appearance of his loins downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about as the appearance of the bow he saw seven different colors he saw seven different colors as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance look every bit of that he sums it up right here in one sentence this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and you were included every bit of that whole scene is that Holy Ghost working through you through the lion ox man and eagle let's stand to our feet I'll I'll start again next Sunday but man you got Revelations 4 that we saw that and then you got uh I want you to remember this I know most of you know this but if you look that word up living creature are the four Beast that is a zoon are a living being all right now if you go on a little bit further it talks about the beast in chapter Revelations 1113 to 17 that is interpretated as a theion beast or a wild untamable Beast which is going to be the beast in the end time so we'll get to that later we'll we'll we'll stop right here though God bless you
