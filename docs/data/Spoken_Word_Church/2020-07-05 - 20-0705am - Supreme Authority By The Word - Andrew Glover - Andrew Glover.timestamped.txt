[28:19] name of the Lord Jesus by what a what an
[28:23] atmosphere has been created in the

[28:26] before the believers arrived here there
[28:28] was no God here this God don't dwell in
[28:30] sheetrock and carpet but he dwells in
[28:32] the hearts of his children I believe
[28:33] this morning he's here a man if you have
[28:36] your Bibles today we'll go straight to
[28:38] the scripture to the Book of Numbers we
[28:41] want to look there in the 14th chapter
[28:43] numbers the 14th chapter and while
[28:45] you're returning there we want to take
[28:47] this opportunity to say we have sure
[28:49] enjoyed being here with you this weekend
[28:51] and sure pray that something was said
[28:54] yesterday to bless you and help you the
[28:56] young people in the meeting and I sure
[28:58] appreciate the vision and the burden to
[29:00] have the meeting for the young people as
[29:02] we said with all the camps and things
[29:03] been canceled because of the things
[29:06] going on in our land today amen I think
[29:08] it was special to be able to get
[29:09] together with young people again amen
[29:11] just to worship the Lord and sure when I
[29:13] say we appreciate brother Sam and he's
[29:15] allowing us to come and minister to you
[29:17] this weekend and met brother brother Sam
[29:19] and brother Wade several years back in
[29:21] the ministers meeting and I was a young
[29:25] feller then still young but just reeling
[29:27] thing I really admired about brother Sam
[29:29] was every time I heard him in those
[29:31] ministers meetings he was promoting the
[29:32] message and I thank God for elders that
[29:35] are here standing promoting this message
[29:37] and you see the morning you see this
[29:39] morning the fruit amen of a pastor that
[29:41] will promote the message we man we we
[29:43] want to say god bless you brother Sam
[29:45] we're doing that somebody that will just
[29:48] say what a prophet said and not change
[29:50] it or water it down but say it the way
[29:52] he said it and I admire that in your
[29:54] brother and I appreciate it so god bless
[29:55] you this morning and we just want to
[29:57] look here in the Book of Numbers the
[29:58] 14th chapter and the 41st verse and
[30:03] before we read this one acquiesced by
[30:04] our hearts together we pray over a
[30:07] natural mill and ask the Lord to bless
[30:09] it and we know this is a spiritual meal
[30:10] so let's just ask the Lord to come and
[30:12] speak to his heavenly Father Lord as we
[30:15] gather here this morning we do not come
[30:17] here out of ritual we do not come here
[30:19] out of tradition father but we come here
[30:22] because there is a deep calling to the
[30:23] deep on the inside of our hearts and
[30:25] Lord we know that your word has promised
[30:28] us that where two or three would gather
[30:29] in your name father you said you would
[30:32] come and be in the midst of them and I
[30:33] believe here this morning that you're
[30:35] here in the midst of the church I
[30:37] believe that you're here in power
[30:38] I believe you're here in authority I
[30:40] believe you're here in reality this
[30:42] morning and father we know that as
[30:44] believers come together
[30:45] Lord we all come from different walks of
[30:47] life different Lord trials different
[30:50] situations we're all in needy people
[30:51] here this morning but father we know
[30:54] that your word is still a discerner of
[30:55] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[30:57] and Lord as your prophet has taught us
[30:59] that the gift of the of a preacher is to
[31:01] be able to get himself out of the way
[31:03] and I pray this one in O God that you
[31:05] would come and you would help me this
[31:06] one and Lord to get myself out of the
[31:08] way father you see what I've looked at
[31:10] and prepared and studied but father I
[31:13] know that you know if there's a need in
[31:14] this building Lord you can lead me away
[31:16] from these nodes Lord you can lead me in
[31:19] the direction you would have me to go
[31:21] father and I just ask you this morning
[31:22] to help me Lord to be sensitive to your
[31:24] spirit father may you anoint me Lord but
[31:26] I ask you not just anoint me as the
[31:28] speaker but O God may you're not the
[31:30] people as the hearers father Lord may
[31:32] you Lord anoint them to pull and to
[31:34] receive this morning near God and father
[31:36] is we have come this morning we know
[31:38] their sickness in the land
[31:40] we know there's discouragements there's
[31:41] bondages there's trials but I pray this
[31:44] morning Lord that you would send a grace
[31:45] this morning from the Word of God that
[31:48] would cover your children today Lord
[31:50] father I pray you at bond the hand of
[31:52] every enemy that would try to torment
[31:54] them near God you would bind the hand of
[31:56] every spirit that would try to hold them
[31:58] this morning Lord and father may they
[32:00] hear that jubilee trumpet this morning
[32:02] sounding their God they can go free
[32:04] father I pray you and bless them this
[32:06] morning
[32:06] anoint us afresh today God and we'll be
[32:08] sure to give you all the praise all the
[32:10] honor and all the glory Lord we asked
[32:12] you to forgive us of our failures and
[32:13] our shortcomings or may when we leave
[32:15] this service today God may we leave
[32:17] closer to you than we were when we come
[32:19] and we'll give you all the praise all
[32:21] the honor and all the glory for it's in
[32:23] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[32:24] Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[32:27] believers said a man and a man in the
[32:30] book of numbers here the 14th chapter in
[32:32] the 41st verse the Bible here says and
[32:37] Moses said wherefore now do you
[32:39] transgress the commandment of the Lord
[32:41] but it shall not prosper go not up for
[32:45] the Lord is not among you that you be
[32:47] not smitten he says before your enemies
[32:50] for the Amalekites and the Canaanites
[32:52] are there before you and ye shall fall
[32:55] by the sword because you are turned away
[32:58] from the Lord therefore the Lord will
[33:00] not be with you now here Moses is a
[33:02] vindicated prophet of God speaking to
[33:04] them telling them this is what's going
[33:07] to happen this is what's going to
[33:08] transpire and they presumed to go up
[33:11] under the hilltop nevertheless the Ark
[33:14] of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses
[33:16] departed not out of the camp and then
[33:18] the Amalekites came down and the
[33:20] Canaanites was dwelling that hill and
[33:22] smoked them and disken fitted them even
[33:25] on to her ma we asked the Lord this
[33:28] morning to add the blessing to the
[33:30] reading of his word as you may have your
[33:32] seats here for just a few moments this
[33:34] morning by the help of the Lord I'd like
[33:36] to if I can to minister to you here out
[33:38] of these scriptures and for those of you
[33:40] that study the message and listen to the
[33:41] tapes you're very well aware of that
[33:43] this was brother brems text for the
[33:45] message presuming and I want to speak to
[33:48] here for just a few moments here on
[33:50] supreme authority by the word supreme
[33:53] authority by the word when you begin to
[33:55] speak about authority we all know that
[33:57] brother BAM tells us we don't have any
[33:59] power he says but we have authority he
[34:02] said they don't take power someone said
[34:04] you got any power no but I've got
[34:06] authority that's right he said you take
[34:08] a little policeman standing out there he
[34:10] wears
[34:10] uniform his hat is too big for him sits
[34:12] down over his ears he hasn't got power
[34:15] to stop nothing he said but let him walk
[34:17] out there in a car coming down the
[34:19] street with 300 horsepower engine let
[34:21] him raise up that hand and watch the
[34:23] brake slide he said why he hasn't got no
[34:26] power but he's got Authority and when a
[34:29] man or woman is anointed with the
[34:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost he may not be
[34:33] able to read his name in bockscar sized
[34:35] letters with education but he has got
[34:37] authority from God and that he is a son
[34:39] of God and let him take his authority
[34:42] and stand and say stop he meant and
[34:44] Satan's wheels will slide brakes will
[34:46] something will take place because he's
[34:49] been given authority by the Holy Ghost
[34:51] amen
[34:52] then my name they shall cast out Devils
[34:54] that's it sure he don't have to have a
[34:55] DD D or a PhD he has to know Jesus and
[34:59] know what's been given him there he
[35:01] stands yes sir so amen I think this
[35:04] morning that we're aware amen that the
[35:06] hour were living in is a day in time
[35:08] amen where everybody is right Amen
[35:10] everybody is right nobody is wrong amen
[35:13] but I'll just say this we have come to a
[35:15] time Amen that we've got to take a stand
[35:17] they men we've come to a time they meant
[35:19] words it's not going to work just to be
[35:21] a church member it's not going to work
[35:23] amen just to say you believe a prophet
[35:25] and to believe you ain't meant to go to
[35:26] a certain church but there's got to come
[35:28] a time than you as an individual
[35:30] Amen take a personal stand upon this
[35:32] message now admit when you speak when
[35:35] you speak about the message of the hour
[35:37] amen you find that there are many
[35:39] opinions they meant on the message of
[35:41] the hour but I'll say this
[35:42] amen I believe that the message is
[35:44] Christ amen and I believe he meant that
[35:47] Christ is the authority Amen therefore
[35:50] Christ is our authority this morning now
[35:52] Amen I'll just say it this way the
[35:54] message has come with a purpose they
[35:56] meant Amen God didn't send this message
[35:58] just to send another idea amen up on the
[36:00] Bible or send another prophet he meant
[36:03] but he sent it that this message would
[36:04] take our churches and would make them
[36:06] churches of authority amen he sent this
[36:09] message that our homes amen would become
[36:11] home as if Authority our young people
[36:13] him it would become young people of
[36:15] authority Amen to think this morning
[36:18] that we are not here amen based upon a
[36:20] Creed we are not here based upon a
[36:22] tradition
[36:23] amen but we are here because the Bible
[36:25] says we're serving the carcasses and
[36:27] then there the Eagles will be gathered
[36:29] together and what is that carcass this
[36:31] morning it's the word amen and we have
[36:34] come here around the word this morning
[36:36] amen and I'll say there is a power this
[36:39] morning amen there is an authority this
[36:41] morning in the house of God that you can
[36:43] stand up amen and whatever devil is
[36:46] pushing against you you can tell that
[36:48] devil it's time to stop and it has that
[36:50] police officer couldn't stop the car

[36:54] authority he said stop in the car stop
[36:57] amen and I say this morning there is an
[36:59] authority in this message Amen that you
[37:01] can tell the devil Satan you gotta back
[37:03] off a mint we are not just another
[37:05] Church Amen but we are a people of
[37:08] authority Amen to think that the message
[37:10] of the hour this morning it's not a
[37:13] message of presuming amen amen if you
[37:15] listen any tapes at all you'll know but
[37:17] the man was not a presume her he meant
[37:19] he was a prophet of God amen and I'll
[37:22] say it this way the message of the hour
[37:23] is not a message of presuming a meant
[37:26] but the message of the hour is the
[37:28] authority to the church by the Living
[37:30] God amen I'll just lay a foundation here
[37:32] Bible says and the unveiling of God he
[37:35] said think of it the same pillar of fire
[37:37] Amen that come upon those men that wrote
[37:39] the Bible is the same pillar of fire
[37:42] here interpreting the Bible a man he
[37:45] said how we think him for that same
[37:47] water comfort amen what an
[37:49] identification I am so glad amen to be
[37:52] identified in that I don't know what to
[37:54] do he said I'd rather be identified in
[37:56] that than all the Baptist Methodist
[37:58] Presbyterian Lutheran all of the rest of
[38:00] them identified in that word were the
[38:03] Shekinah glory and revelation lays they
[38:07] meant then where is the Sakana glory
[38:09] it's in the word admit where is the
[38:11] revelation it's in the word Amen seek
[38:13] the pillar of fire then appeared visible
[38:16] among us identifying that the message is
[38:19] right timid like he did at the mountain
[38:22] signing I remember before the true
[38:24] message come forth
[38:25] Moses preached and he led them out of
[38:27] Egypt but before the real Commandments
[38:29] was laid down and I love that he says
[38:31] his brother Dale
[38:32] he says the seals was Brawley and he
[38:34] said see God came down before
[38:36] the people and prove that Moses he meant
[38:39] was sent from him that's right in a
[38:41] pillar of fire Moses had seen in a bus
[38:43] had talked to him and in the last days
[38:46] he meant to see the same pillar of fire
[38:49] he meant right among us speaking the
[38:52] same word not only that he meant but
[38:54] interpreted it by making it manifest and
[38:57] proving its the truth they meant see
[39:00] when did Moses meet the pillar of fire
[39:02] he met the pillar of fire before the
[39:04] Exodus
[39:05] he met now come on church he met winded
[39:07] the pillar of fire come to brother
[39:08] branham it didn't come in 64 a minute
[39:11] didn't come in 65 it came before the
[39:14] opening of the seals Amen to identify
[39:16] him as a voice of authority in the age
[39:20] that we're living in my I'll take it
[39:22] this morning
[39:22] amen it does my heart good amen to know
[39:25] when there's so many voices in the land
[39:27] there is a voice of a fire that it's
[39:30] come from this prophet of God amen you
[39:33] say bilenda you get excited about it it
[39:35] excites me amen when I think about a
[39:37] world of confusion Amen when I think
[39:39] about a world when churches don't know
[39:42] what to do Amen preachers don't know
[39:44] what to do Amen we have heard a prophet
[39:46] of God say you've come past this
[39:47] mountain long enough it's time to turn
[39:50] and go northward Amen see brother
[39:52] Branham is showing us them they meant
[39:54] that the hour that we're living in the
[39:55] world
[39:56] it's presuming now amen it was not only
[39:58] that though we're always presuming a
[40:00] member he was showing you every
[40:02] denomination was pursue me even know
[40:04] what were they do and they were able
[40:05] they were assuming Amen that they were
[40:08] right and then they were presuming God
[40:10] was with them Amen they were assuming
[40:12] that they were right then they were
[40:14] presuming that God was with him
[40:16] Amen now see the only way Amen that they
[40:19] could become confidence in the thoughts
[40:21] that God was with them is when they left
[40:23] the word see the Prophet God said I just
[40:27] love to read the word he said because I
[40:29] know that the word is what we stay by it
[40:33] must always be the Word of God or we'll
[40:36] go on the wrong road season without the
[40:38] word Amen were another church they meant
[40:41] without the word were another gathering
[40:44] but when the word is revealed then it
[40:47] brings a meaning to the gathering of the
[40:49] people and then think this morning how
[40:51] many churches amen are gathered in this
[40:53] area
[40:53] amen it's a building they've got music
[40:56] they've got pulpits amen they've got
[40:58] thousands of people they met but they've
[41:00] got no meaning in the gathering because
[41:02] they're presuming amen but here we are
[41:04] this morning we may just be a handful of
[41:07] people ain't meant but in the house of
[41:09] God this morning it's some believers
[41:10] that didn't come here hope and God was
[41:13] going to be here amen but they come here
[41:15] knowing God was going to be here because
[41:17] if his where it is welcome then he is
[41:20] welcomed by the think this morning Amen
[41:23] that the word of the Lord Amen comes to
[41:25] the Prophet now Amos 3:7 even the Bible
[41:28] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[41:30] but he revealeth his secret Amen unto
[41:33] his servants the prophets revelation 10
[41:36] 7 in the days of the voice of the
[41:37] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[41:40] sound he meant the mystery of God should
[41:42] be finished as he hath declared to his
[41:45] servants the prophets
[41:47] amen see then a prophet comes along and
[41:49] says what is a prophet he said a prophet
[41:51] is a diviner of the word see he's not a
[41:55] diviner of your feelings he's not a
[41:58] diviner of your emotions or sensation he
[42:00] meant but he is a diviner of the word
[42:02] and he says seek then there's no higher
[42:05] order they meant to reveal the word than
[42:08] a prophet Amen I'm just laying a
[42:11] foundation here Amen we're just kind of
[42:13] getting to know each other this morning
[42:15] amen outset this way I'll set the way
[42:17] the Prophet said notice not when he
[42:19] starts on but when he begins to declare
[42:21] his message see the first pull healing
[42:25] Amen the second pull prophesied Amen the
[42:28] third pull was the opening of the word
[42:30] he said the mysteries revealed no higher
[42:33] order amen to reveal the word than
[42:36] prophets but the only way the Prophet
[42:38] can be vindicated is by the word amen
[42:42] see the third pull I love this amen and
[42:44] remember the third pour was the opening
[42:47] of him seven seals to reveal the hidden
[42:49] truth that's been sealed in the
[42:52] word Amen I think of this this morning
[42:54] there's three pools he meant there's a
[42:56] first pool which was healing there's a
[42:58] second pool which was prophesy and
[43:00] there's a third pool he said which was
[43:02] the opening of the word not now watch
[43:04] this you are a triune beam Amen your
[43:07] body you are spirit and your soul amen
[43:10] now listen friends you know as well as I
[43:12] know that first pool
[43:13] Amen was dealing with the flesh Amen it
[43:16] was dealing with the flesh source of
[43:17] sickness there he meant that second pool
[43:19] was dealing with discernment which broke
[43:21] into the spirits amen but when you come
[43:23] to that third pill it is dealing with
[43:25] forward which has got to be not in your
[43:27] flesh Amen not in your spirits Amen but
[43:30] the word is got to be anchored in your
[43:32] soul and I say this morning church if
[43:34] the word is not in the church this is
[43:37] just the building and Devils can have
[43:39] their way amen but if the word is here
[43:41] we can stand up and say Satan in the
[43:44] name of Jesus Christ by the authority
[43:46] for the word of the Living God
[43:48] we take jurisdiction over the church my
[43:53] what an honor to be living in and then
[43:55] what a time when the word has come back
[43:58] to the church amen we are not here this
[44:00] morning
[44:01] amen just reading the Bible and then
[44:03] your pastor has not been preaching all
[44:04] these years just reading scriptures amen
[44:07] but there's an authority behind this
[44:08] pulpit amen what put authority behind it
[44:11] the message of the hour and then I feel
[44:16] good this morning amen you find then
[44:18] what happens is is when a prophet comes
[44:20] amen demons begin to tremble they met
[44:23] when a prophet comes hell gets nervous
[44:24] they met when a prophet comes on the
[44:27] scene amen now let's just preacher for a
[44:29] second Amen because the idea of a
[44:31] prophets greatly changed from Bible
[44:33] times till today admit when a prophet
[44:35] showed up in Bible times amen it wasn't
[44:37] a happy go lucky day and then it wasn't
[44:40] God's gonna bless you in the bank
[44:41] accounts gonna when a prophet showed up
[44:43] God meant business amen and I thank God
[44:45] that in the last days when the world had
[44:47] fallen under an error
[44:49] Amen oh what a prophet is he would send
[44:51] a prophet among us that would not be a
[44:53] Hollywood evangelist amen but he would
[44:55] be a pillar of higher anointed man they
[44:57] meant to stand and take the Bible which
[45:00] was a symbolic book and reveal it in
[45:04] I'm just going to and then I'm just
[45:05] going to give you a disclaimer here when
[45:07] I get in this area I get happy payment
[45:09] because under a profit symbols become
[45:12] revelation Amen under a profits Amen it
[45:15] removes the element of mystery and opens
[45:18] up the reality of what was behind that
[45:21] mystery see in the fourth seal he said
[45:23] the book has actually been closed all
[45:25] the time it's there but it's still in
[45:27] symbols they seen it John even saw its
[45:29] Amen the announcement when the first
[45:31] come forth he said a white horse went
[45:33] forth he had a rider on him see he might
[45:35] stumble Amen it was just in a symbol he
[45:38] said as far as any man upon the earth
[45:40] that's all he could say he could only
[45:41] say what he saw oh brother
[45:44] ain't never brother Sam I remember one
[45:45] time I just started preaching and I was
[45:47] a preacher guy and I stopped preaching
[45:49] us I've been studying that seventh seal
[45:51] the third pull Amen the only word and it
[45:53] was just it was bubbling in me you know
[45:55] y'all know how it is
[45:56] Amen and I was preaching away and I said
[45:58] praise God Amen that flirt pull is here
[46:00] and it's in effect in the church my
[46:02] brother sitting over he got all bolt
[46:03] blowed up you know after service she
[46:05] said brother you better you better leave
[46:06] that alone there ain't no authority in
[46:08] that Amen you need to leave that alone
[46:09] he said you can't preach sides Amen I
[46:11] said brother I said me ask you something
[46:13] do you preach holiness he said of course
[46:15] I preach holiness I said you know why
[46:17] your preaching is because you see it
[46:18] Amen and when you see something you
[46:20] can't help it when you see it
[46:22] amen come on when you see it it's gonna
[46:25] ignite a fire I pray this morning Church
[46:28] at the same God ain't been that opened
[46:30] the eyes of Paul Heyman would come in
[46:32] this building today and he would open
[46:34] your eyes and you would see more than
[46:36] just a church you would see more than
[46:38] just a preacher but you would see there
[46:40] is a reality to this message and then I
[46:44] will go a step further and say when you
[46:45] see it you can't unsee it ain't it when
[46:48] you see something you can't unsee when
[46:50] you hear something you can't unhear it a
[46:52] minute I think God him in the car
[46:54] preached this morning I think God there
[46:56] is some people in this land today that
[46:58] has seen this message they have heard
[47:00] this message it is clicking the inside
[47:03] of their soul amen and the
[47:04] that they can turn away from it now
[47:07] they've done been behind the veil
[47:09] they've done laid in the Shekinah glory
[47:11] they've done eat the shewbread amen it's
[47:14] done become real to them my he might
[47:17] stumble he might stagger amen but when
[47:19] he sees it Amen he might hit here and
[47:22] hit there but when he sees that we find
[47:24] out that in the book of Revelation at
[47:26] the seventh angels message
[47:27] he says the mysteries all the mysteries
[47:30] of it should already be revealed by that
[47:32] time amen now let's just preacher this
[47:35] morning
[47:35] and then you don't know what a blessing
[47:37] it is to be preached to the church that
[47:38] you know they believe the message a
[47:41] minute let's just be honest and then
[47:43] people get scared to death of the word
[47:44] mystery a minute let me just tell you
[47:47] the reason why they get scared it's not
[47:50] because what brother Branham done with
[47:52] it because of what men behind him done
[47:54] with for it like the thunders Amen you
[47:56] say seven thunders and everybody gets
[47:58] halt or Amen but let me remind you
[48:00] Amen before there was a false teaching
[48:02] of the thunders there was a vindicated
[48:04] prophet preached in the seven thunders
[48:06] he meant before there was a false
[48:08] teaching on the seven seals there was a
[48:10] vindicated prophet preaching the true
[48:12] teacher seat then we've come to the time
[48:14] a meant were the backbone of this bride
[48:17] is those divine revealed mystery truths
[48:20] see that it should be revealed according
[48:23] to that time now in Daniel 12:4
[48:25] the Bible says but now lo Daniel Amen
[48:28] shut up the words and seal the book even
[48:30] to the time of the end for many shall
[48:33] run to and fro and knowledge shall be
[48:35] increased even now if you go read like
[48:37] the Book of Daniel you read the book of
[48:39] Zechariah the book of all the Old
[48:41] Testament prophets you're constantly
[48:42] reading symbols when you read the book
[48:46] of Zechariah he's gonna talk about
[48:48] golden candlesticks and lampstand you're
[48:50] reading about symbols amen see tonight
[48:53] as long as it's in symbol form amen then
[48:56] there's no threat to the devil
[48:57] amen because there's no understanding of
[49:00] what the symbol is in the message of
[49:03] seven churches Church age is how the
[49:05] book of Revelation how it's made up and
[49:06] he says see how Daniel tiles with it he
[49:09] said Isaiah ties it with it all the Old
[49:12] Testament ties in with the book of
[49:13] Revelation he said it's the book of the
[49:16] relationship Jesus Christ he said seeing
[49:18] mark the beach 54 remember all the
[49:21] revelation is in vision and symbolic he
[49:24] said all of it has a meaning Amen so you
[49:26] have to watch closely
[49:27] Amen read the prophets Amen see what the
[49:30] symbols men then compare it over here so
[49:33] that you'll know what the symbols really
[49:35] mean Amen in the pen then you say the
[49:37] Bible amen the Bible actually itself is
[49:39] a natural symbol do you realize that the
[49:43] cross Amon is a symbol
[49:45] Amen although the Bible's full of
[49:47] symbols they meant but what it's going
[49:49] to make it real to you is when the
[49:51] spirit that put the symbol there amen
[49:53] comes up on your heart and click ins the
[49:56] symbol you're looking at see in the
[49:58] message look he said what are you
[49:59] looking at what do you see it we must
[50:01] see Jesus and the only way we see Jesus
[50:04] is see the word Amen see this the Bible
[50:07] is the natural symbol of the Spirit you
[50:10] know what I mean it's the letter the
[50:12] spirit clip-ins
[50:13] see the letter then the Spirit quickens
[50:16] the letter and makes it a reality
[50:19] amen so then you find that there's
[50:21] actual order amen of how the reality
[50:24] comes or the revelation comes its first
[50:26] a symbol in heaven amen the symbol is a
[50:29] symbol in heaven amen men the reality
[50:32] comes in that symbol up on the earth are
[50:34] you with me this morning and then I'll
[50:36] catch this and then look at those three
[50:38] stars that lined up that was a symbol
[50:41] Amen that three major eyes who looked at
[50:43] the whole world could see those three
[50:45] stars amen but to the world it was
[50:47] symbols amen but to those major eyes it
[50:50] become a reality because the spirit that
[50:52] put the symbol there was the spirit that
[50:55] come upon them and said go find him that
[50:58] is born King of the Jews Amen see the
[51:00] symbol will not move the church but when
[51:03] the reality of that symbol comes it'll
[51:06] move the church it'll put a fire oh come
[51:09] on church it is the rising of the Sun he
[51:11] said you can polish it he said you can
[51:13] get it the best but the best cards he
[51:16] said like that train out there he said
[51:18] but what's wrong with it he said there's
[51:19] no gas in the engine room and then
[51:21] there's no fire in the engine room and I
[51:23] say this morning Church we can hang the
[51:25] pictures up we can memorize
[51:27] so close we can get everything just
[51:29] right amen but if the spirit doesn't
[51:31] come it's just a symbol but if the
[51:34] Spirit comes it becomes a reality this
[51:37] morning oh this should be the name of
[51:39] the Lord and then the Prophet says is it
[51:41] strange Amen that these stars were
[51:44] exactly in line for three men he said
[51:46] nobody else saw it Amen see just exactly
[51:48] in line and then they you realize you
[51:50] can look at something and not see it no
[51:54] doubt other people could look up there
[51:55] remember sewing you that they could see
[51:57] it but they couldn't see it Amen see and
[51:59] when those stars
[52:00] becoming unity they United themselves
[52:03] together in this constellation and three
[52:05] men a men were also anointed at the same
[52:07] time they meant so when God puts a
[52:10] symbol in the heavens he unites the
[52:12] people on the earth they meant to
[52:14] receive the revelation of that symbol
[52:16] are you with me he said you can be so
[52:18] United with God in his word until these
[52:22] things become realities and you see them
[52:25] and you know they are truth he said see
[52:28] signs of the time you might look right
[52:30] over the top of it and say our nonsense
[52:33] a ment but if there is a seed if there
[52:35] is a pull if there is a crime your soul
[52:38] and then God will give you the reality
[52:41] now you just got to realize this morning
[52:44] Amen I'm the older preached me and I'm
[52:46] trying to lay a foundation but get
[52:48] something John wrote the symbols they
[52:50] meant Daniel wrote the symbols amen
[52:53] Zechariah wrote the symbols amen amen
[52:55] Moses wrote symbols amen but as we said
[52:58] symbols must be revealed and the
[53:00] revelation of that symbol is what makes
[53:03] it a reality a minutes in the seventh
[53:05] angel of revelation 10 now what is he
[53:07] going to do he is going to unseal what
[53:10] has been sealed round now let's just
[53:12] take for one here in revelation 6:1 he
[53:15] said I saw when the lamb opened one of
[53:18] these seals and I heard as it were the
[53:20] noise of thunder one the four beasts
[53:22] saying come and see and I saw and behold
[53:25] a white horse and he that sat upon him
[53:27] had a bow and a crown was given unto him
[53:30] and he went forth conquering and to
[53:32] conquer now if it's okay to sit this way
[53:35] at one point but the man preached
[53:36] revelation 6 as a symbol when he
[53:40] preaches the mighty conquer
[53:41] what's he doing he's preaching it under
[53:43] a symbolic revelation that there is a
[53:46] bow there is a wild horse but then the
[53:48] Spirit comes in the seals and says no
[53:50] that is not Christ that is the
[53:53] Antichrist that is the deceiver and he
[53:55] said see it became real and then seat
[53:58] when the Spirit come it brought it from
[54:00] symbol to reality and then now the first
[54:03] seal he picks it up and says let's just
[54:04] read a little bit further
[54:05] he reads revelation 6:1 he said when the
[54:08] lamb broke that first seal he set a
[54:10] thunder roared
[54:11] he said now that's got a significance
[54:14] it's got a meaning and he said nothing
[54:16] happens without a meaning alright a
[54:18] thunder a thunder roared wonder what
[54:21] happened he said see wonder what that
[54:23] thunder was he said now listen here he
[54:25] said we won't have to wonder no more
[54:29] brother that makes me want to put my
[54:31] shouting shoes home when a prophet says
[54:33] we won't have to wonder no more
[54:35] what is John 12 the hour has come that
[54:39] the Son of man should be glorified see
[54:40] you're at the end of an age there his
[54:43] ministry is ending he said see the hour
[54:45] has come that the son of man should be
[54:47] glorified what about the hour has come
[54:49] with his bride must be taken away when
[54:52] the angel has come that time shall be no
[54:54] more
[54:55] he said the angel is ready to set one
[54:57] foot on land and the other on sea where
[54:59] the rainbow over his head over his over
[55:02] him with his feet and say time has run
[55:04] out and besides that he raised up his
[55:06] hand and swore that time would be no
[55:08] more when this happened how perfect is
[55:11] it
[55:11] it is a sworn affidavit to the church
[55:14] now my soul trouble he goes on to read
[55:17] here in paragraph 146 then when the lamb
[55:20] opened took the book and the broke the
[55:22] first seal God spoke from his eternal
[55:24] throne to say what the seal was to be
[55:27] revealed but when it's before John it
[55:29] was in symbol they met now think of this
[55:31] when it was before John it was in symbol
[55:35] when John saw it it was still a mystery
[55:37] amen why it wasn't even revealed right
[55:40] then it cannot be revealed until what he
[55:43] said here at the end time but it comes
[55:45] in a symbol now
[55:47] morena loud clapping noise of thunder is
[55:50] the voice of God
[55:51] alright then we won't talk about thunder
[55:52] let's talk about it he said it's the
[55:54] voice of God he said that's what the
[55:57] Bible said
[55:58] it's a clap of thunder they thought it
[56:00] was a thunder but it was God he said see
[56:02] notice the first seal when it was open
[56:04] in the symbol for me thunder I love this
[56:07] now what about when it's open in its
[56:09] reality form Amen see if it thundered
[56:12] when it opened in its symbol form he
[56:15] said then it'll thunder when it opens in
[56:16] its reality form since all right he said
[56:20] see it thundered as soon as that lamb
[56:21] struck back the seal and what did it
[56:23] reveal not all of itself Amen see first
[56:27] now notice to notice the three-fold
[56:28] unfolding of a symbol Amen first it's
[56:31] with God then next it's with symbol then
[56:34] it's revealed three things it's coming
[56:36] forth from the throne first it can be
[56:38] seen or nothing can't be seen or nothing
[56:41] it's sealed up they may not now kind of
[56:43] preached here for a second amen if you
[56:45] were coming in this building here this
[56:46] morning and there was no lights on in
[56:48] here and you just walked up the aisle
[56:49] there was no witness it was completely
[56:51] dark and you're walking along by the way
[56:53] and all the sudden you trip and you keep
[56:56] on walking and you turn around and you
[56:58] walk back in your trip again and then
[56:59] though you say brother brother what no
[57:01] Road am i tripping over alright there's
[57:03] no light they meant there's no way to
[57:05] identify the object amen so I say
[57:07] brother Sam what what was brother Wade
[57:09] tripping over and brother Sam says well
[57:11] I'll tell you what I think he tripped
[57:12] over
[57:12] I think somebody left a vacuum in the
[57:14] middle of floor so then I said brother
[57:15] real Aaron what did he trip over a
[57:17] menace I'll tell you what I think he
[57:19] tripped over I think you tripped over
[57:20] your big shoe brother Andrew Amen now
[57:23] I've got to I've got two opinions amen
[57:26] of one symbol are you with me then I go
[57:28] to brother Louise I said well at least
[57:29] what what did what did brother Wade try
[57:31] what did he what did he trip home Reese
[57:33] well I think what it is is a piece of
[57:34] wood okay now we've got three opinions a
[57:37] mint of one symbol and which one is and
[57:40] then he says it's this he says it's a
[57:43] shoe he says it's wood he says it's a
[57:45] vacuum Amen you've got all these voices
[57:47] talking about the same thing Amen but
[57:49] what's going to separate amen all the
[57:51] voices is when there is a man here who
[57:54] can turn on the lights
[57:55] let's see then when the light comes home
[58:01] when the light comes on the light is not
[58:04] going to change what is laying there the
[58:07] light is only going to reveal what is
[58:09] laying there Amen don't you see this
[58:11] morning predestination was laying there
[58:14] seven seals were laying there and then
[58:17] the oneness of the Godhead was laying
[58:19] there but they were tripping over it's
[58:20] amen but there was a voice came it was
[58:23] the voice of the seventh angel and said
[58:25] this is what it is it's not a church
[58:27] it's a bride I'm not gonna call your
[58:31] church I'm gonna call your bride to
[58:35] think this morning it's only revealed in
[58:37] the last day when this actual seal is
[58:39] broken broken to who not to Christ but
[58:42] to the church see Christ knew what it
[58:45] was all along when John was looking at
[58:47] it in symbol Christ knew what it was
[58:49] when Daniel looked at it in symbol
[58:51] Christ knew what it was Amen but when
[58:54] the symbol become a revelation it became
[58:56] real to the bride Amen you simply under
[58:59] what do you why did you take so much
[59:00] time
[59:01] amen to speak on symbols because I want
[59:03] to say something to you this morning
[59:05] let's go this morning Amen from symbol
[59:08] to reality you said with Ana is it
[59:11] possible he says here in my little
[59:13] Bethlehem oh come all ye faithful we've
[59:15] been singing come to Bethlehem he said
[59:17] Lord let them see that it's not go to a
[59:20] little city under that once was in a
[59:22] symbol but let's go to the reality Jesus
[59:26] Christ God's bread and water of life
[59:30] how many will say this morning I want to
[59:32] go to reality amen I just don't want to
[59:35] sit here looking at symbols Amen come on
[59:37] young people as long as this message
[59:39] it's nothing but charts and pictures and
[59:42] books and tapes it'll only be a matter
[59:44] of time and then before you leave it
[59:46] amen but when it becomes a reality to
[59:48] you it becomes more than a Sunday School
[59:51] lesson it becomes more than a doctrine
[59:53] it becomes a fire
[59:55] becomes a fire that will consume and
[59:57] then the zeal of your house Oh blessed
[1:00:00] be the name of the Lord what an hour to
[1:00:02] be living when the reality of the word
[1:00:05] he said now the return of the Holy
[1:00:07] Spirit is bringing the word in us and
[1:00:10] it's abiding in there then it's not you
[1:00:13] that speaks it's the word itself coming
[1:00:16] out see then what is your authority
[1:00:19] spoken word church it's not your
[1:00:21] building Amen it's not your pictures on
[1:00:23] the wall your authority is this pulpit
[1:00:26] has been dedicated to this message and
[1:00:29] it has become more than symbol it has
[1:00:32] become reality Oh to think this morning
[1:00:35] man ain't meant to presume anything it
[1:00:38] means to venture without actual
[1:00:40] Authority amen or take for granted now -
[1:00:43] Vince without actual Authority or to
[1:00:45] take for granted to do something before
[1:00:47] you are authorized to do it without the
[1:00:50] actual authority to do it and then I
[1:00:53] think of something this morning the
[1:00:54] problem of God is going to introduce to
[1:00:56] us a term and he's going to call it
[1:00:57] scriptural Authority he's going to say
[1:01:01] see they have gone off without
[1:01:03] scriptural Authority they've got an
[1:01:05] authority but it's not a vindicated
[1:01:08] Authority now you think of this morning
[1:01:10] how then it comes around December time
[1:01:12] amen air back starts presume and that
[1:01:14] Christ was born on December 25th Amen
[1:01:17] see they have no they have no actual
[1:01:19] backing to base that but what they've
[1:01:21] done is because they've not found the
[1:01:23] reality it's still in symbol form Amen
[1:01:26] to them it's just as real as it is to
[1:01:28] you that he was born in April
[1:01:30] Amen see but why is it real to you
[1:01:31] because a revelation has come now you
[1:01:34] find them that probably go on and say
[1:01:36] that they actually have New Year's
[1:01:37] parties he says see what they're doing
[1:01:39] this they're celebrating presuming that
[1:01:42] their sins of the old year is gone and
[1:01:44] then I think here what this presuming do
[1:01:47] he said presuming actually produces a
[1:01:50] blanketing of the mind now when you
[1:01:52] study that you'll find that people
[1:01:54] actually practice what's called a
[1:01:56] blanketing of the mind now what it is he
[1:02:00] says as they blink in their mind and
[1:02:02] they let it become a Dale or become idle
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:05] whatever comes in is what comes in he
[1:02:08] said see like whisky is actually a
[1:02:11] blinking of the mind he said actually
[1:02:13] makes the mind become idle when it comes
[1:02:15] into that system now see the world calls
[1:02:17] it a little clean fun Amen but you got
[1:02:20] to remember that we are not commissioned
[1:02:22] Amen to let our minds become idle amen
[1:02:25] because when your mind becomes idle then
[1:02:28] demon powers can come in but the Bible
[1:02:30] said that we should meditate upon the
[1:02:33] word both day and night see he said see
[1:02:36] you just open your soul to Satan and
[1:02:38] he'll give you something he said but if
[1:02:40] you open it to Christ if he should come
[1:02:43] in here with all the intelligence he got
[1:02:44] he said closing the mind they come to
[1:02:46] him every promise in the scripture he
[1:02:49] said keep your mind alert when you come
[1:02:51] to Christ don't let it go blank the
[1:02:53] devil will make you do anything see
[1:02:55] he'll give you a sensation but you won't
[1:02:58] an experience Amen something that the
[1:03:00] Bible teaches something that's real then
[1:03:02] you find where the churches come through
[1:03:04] this morning is the problem of God since
[1:03:06] we've come to another Kadesh Barnea he
[1:03:09] said we've come to another another
[1:03:11] showdown where we're either going to go
[1:03:13] on or we're going to stay here amen
[1:03:15] brother brother waiting for fellowship
[1:03:17] and yesterday last night about it see
[1:03:19] the polygon said there was a service 3
[1:03:21] or 4 death messengers amen that eating
[1:03:23] that tree of life down he said there
[1:03:25] were four life messengers that restored
[1:03:28] that tree back he said see the pond worm
[1:03:30] the caterpillar the cankerworm and the
[1:03:33] locusts eat it down amen but he said
[1:03:35] Luther Wesley
[1:03:36] Pentecost for life messengers he said
[1:03:39] see now watch the fourth is the word
[1:03:42] itself justification made way for
[1:03:45] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:03:48] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:50] said see and the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:53] Ghost made way for the person himself
[1:03:56] amen to come into the church but let me
[1:03:59] say this morning church we are not amen
[1:04:02] a Pentecostal age we are not a
[1:04:04] Pentecostal baby this morning amen the
[1:04:07] Prophet screamed as plain as I can
[1:04:08] he said see get out of the shucks and
[1:04:11] let's go to the seed there's where the
[1:04:13] life is
[1:04:14] I say this morning's hurts your kadish
[1:04:17] Barnea it's not necessarily going to be
[1:04:20] going from justification to save the
[1:04:21] vacation
[1:04:22] it's not gonna be going maybe just from
[1:04:24] st. vacation through that didn't Holy
[1:04:25] Ghost but a lot of the kata smartears is
[1:04:28] to go from the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:30] into the person himself Christ the word
[1:04:36] now when you see that the Prophet God
[1:04:39] said see what you're gonna do is read
[1:04:41] they're gonna go on brendham Tabernacle
[1:04:43] he said you're gonna go on
[1:04:44] amen to a real revival or you're gonna
[1:04:46] stay here eating the melon the leek the
[1:04:49] garlic all those things he said seat
[1:04:51] you're gonna go on are you gonna stay
[1:04:53] here
[1:04:53] he said judgment begins at the house of
[1:04:56] God now think of this who was saying
[1:04:59] that a vindicated prophet then you find
[1:05:03] that the overpowering and the
[1:05:05] overshadowing presence of Almighty God
[1:05:07] is stronger than the power of the evil
[1:05:10] one to stop you from going on see let me
[1:05:13] sit this way we will go forth in the
[1:05:16] message of the hour
[1:05:18] amen there is a people in the earth
[1:05:20] today what will their news so and so's
[1:05:22] fallen and so-and-so squit that doesn't
[1:05:24] change the facts amen that there's going
[1:05:26] to be a bride that's going to come out
[1:05:28] of the shock she is out of it shut this
[1:05:31] morning and she is in the presence of
[1:05:33] the Sun and then to think this morning
[1:05:35] their numbers 14 the Bible says that
[1:05:38] Moses would give them all together now
[1:05:40] what was Moses he was a prophet and
[1:05:43] Moses would gather them together and he
[1:05:45] would say now look here's what's gonna
[1:05:46] happen
[1:05:47] here's what's gonna happen you're going
[1:05:48] to go up and you're going to presume
[1:05:50] it's what is exactly what's going to
[1:05:52] happen and they said oh no a minute let
[1:05:54] me just read it to you this way here
[1:05:56] israel presumed that they were all right
[1:05:58] he had been a real good god he said he
[1:06:01] had been a good god he went down in
[1:06:02] egypt brought them out of bondage sure
[1:06:03] he was a good god why even Rain Man out
[1:06:06] of heaven upon him God God God a good
[1:06:08] God see it was very well but then when
[1:06:10] it come down to the time that his word
[1:06:12] was beat to fulfill see that the battle
[1:06:15] comes when the word becomes fulfilled
[1:06:16] when it comes to Kadish Barnea and the
[1:06:19] spies come back with the evidence of the
[1:06:22] land beyond then they presumed they
[1:06:24] would be alright if they would bypass
[1:06:25] that
[1:06:27] and God was angry with him and I think
[1:06:29] of this here what they're doing is
[1:06:31] they're bypassing a vindicated voice
[1:06:33] they're taking a vindicated voice and
[1:06:36] saying no Moses Noah Moses listen here's
[1:06:39] what's gonna happen
[1:06:40] we're gonna do this so we're good and
[1:06:41] we're going to carry on and Moses says
[1:06:43] but no here's what's going to happen is
[1:06:45] you're going to go up there and the
[1:06:46] Amalekites a men are going to bring you
[1:06:48] down and paraphrase said amen and what
[1:06:51] happened brother amen exactly what Moses
[1:06:54] said is what happened
[1:06:56] amen and noticed us grief notice the
[1:07:00] heartache they could have spared the
[1:07:02] cells had they listened to a vindicated
[1:07:05] voice but they bypassed that voice and
[1:07:08] said no it'll be this way it'll be okay
[1:07:11] and I'm gonna bring that to today they
[1:07:14] meant what what a bunch of grief you
[1:07:15] could spare your home let me just let me
[1:07:17] aim it I'm just going to preach for a
[1:07:19] second let me just take liberty here
[1:07:21] remind you
[1:07:22] amen that the pastor behind this pulpit
[1:07:24] it's not just his job he's not just here
[1:07:27] studying and preaching just to entertain
[1:07:29] you amen it is a vindicated voice of
[1:07:32] authority to your life
[1:07:34] a voice of authority to your home and
[1:07:36] when that man of God tells you something
[1:07:38] you shouldn't count it that's just
[1:07:40] something another idea or just another
[1:07:42] opinion but you should take that man's
[1:07:45] advice if he's a vindicated voice which
[1:07:48] he is by the message of the hour you
[1:07:50] should take it and heed to it say it
[1:07:54] make it make it tight here but it won't
[1:07:59] be the first time it's gone tight when I
[1:08:00] was preaching amen but come on church
[1:08:02] when a pastor tells you don't do that
[1:08:04] and you say oh what's he know and then
[1:08:07] what's he know about admit but he's
[1:08:09] telling you something to spare your
[1:08:11] heartache how many troubles and trials
[1:08:13] could you avoid in your life have you
[1:08:16] listened instead of presumed oh brother
[1:08:20] Andrew I don't want to I don't want
[1:08:22] instructions Amen well then what you're
[1:08:24] going to take his emotions amen and if
[1:08:26] you take emotions let's see what the
[1:08:28] Prophet said he said follow instructions
[1:08:30] not the emotions the instructions if
[1:08:33] Moses would have followed the emotions
[1:08:34] of the people they've been
[1:08:36] all over the mountain screamin Pharaoh's
[1:08:37] army when I got him but they followed
[1:08:40] the instructions then what then what
[1:08:43] brought victory amen to Israel
[1:08:46] why was Miriam dancing we won't talk
[1:08:49] about dancing let's talk about dancing
[1:08:51] why was Miriam dancin she was not
[1:08:54] dancing amen because of who she was she
[1:08:57] was not that her dance was not produced
[1:08:59] Amen because of a feeling her dance was
[1:09:02] produced because somebody had a voice
[1:09:05] and it was a vindicated voice and they
[1:09:07] followed instructions
[1:09:09] brother sister I'll tell you what you
[1:09:12] want to shout start following
[1:09:13] instructions amen you want to dance
[1:09:15] start following instructions amen you
[1:09:17] want to see revival amen start following
[1:09:19] instructions you say then you're making
[1:09:21] this legalism no I'm not in an age where
[1:09:24] nobody wants headship if you raise up
[1:09:27] and say don't do it they'll do it in
[1:09:29] your face
[1:09:30] Amen but here's the mystery of it there
[1:09:32] is a bride on the earth that is
[1:09:34] recognized headship by the mrs. Baur
[1:09:37] oh brother sister we've come to headship
[1:09:41] this morning
[1:09:42] amen seat than what this presuming come
[1:09:44] from presuming comes from fear the
[1:09:47] Prophet said see he said borderline
[1:09:49] believers actually paraphrase that are
[1:09:50] actually presume errs they come so far
[1:09:53] and they think well I'm okay I don't
[1:09:55] need to go no further but they're
[1:09:56] presuming they are okay admit not now it
[1:09:59] amazed me when he preaches presuming he
[1:10:01] actually turns it and he says now you
[1:10:03] take a young lady in the church and then
[1:10:06] I'm not going to take time to read it
[1:10:07] here because it's right in front of me
[1:10:08] if you wanted but he says see he said
[1:10:10] you take a young lady in the church and
[1:10:12] he said maybe she leans a little bit
[1:10:13] towards the world he said then there
[1:10:15] should be elder women in the church that
[1:10:17] she can look to as an example now here
[1:10:21] in an amazing and I mean let me let me
[1:10:23] just let me share some within isn't
[1:10:24] amazing you can have a church full of
[1:10:26] young ladies you can have a church full
[1:10:28] of women you can have you can have a
[1:10:30] sister in there brother wait she prays
[1:10:32] three times a day she listens to tapes

[1:10:44] amen always behind the word always
[1:10:46] helping the church she can be there for
[1:10:48] years amen and young girls looking at
[1:10:50] her and never one time want to be like
[1:10:53] her but you let a girl a woman come in
[1:10:57] church it gets an old lust spirit owner
[1:10:59] and she made me a deacons wife or she
[1:11:01] may be a trustees lifer or some position
[1:11:04] of life and she puts on a pair of high
[1:11:06] heels and then she trims ends of her
[1:11:08] hair puts a little makeup on and every
[1:11:10] girl in the church will start looking at
[1:11:11] that and say you know what we can do
[1:11:13] that and you know what they're doing
[1:11:15] they're presuming you know why well
[1:11:17] she's a deacons wife she can do it and
[1:11:19] if she can do it so can i but let me
[1:11:21] tell you something charts let's get away
[1:11:23] from presuming and let's get back to the
[1:11:25] word and then for the word is our
[1:11:28] example the word is our standard I don't
[1:11:32] care what you do you shouldn't care what
[1:11:34] I do
[1:11:35] it's what the word says Amen and if what
[1:11:38] we're doing is wrong then let's do what
[1:11:40] a prophet said and humble ourselves and
[1:11:42] come back to the word and say God what I
[1:11:45] was doing was wrong but your word is
[1:11:47] right they've been see what brother and
[1:11:49] ER they can do it and they're still
[1:11:51] blessed of God let me remind you that
[1:11:53] the blessings of God is no sign let me
[1:11:56] step this way the blessings of God has
[1:11:58] been reduced the sign of God's blessings
[1:12:00] has been reduced to sunny skies being
[1:12:03] the son of God's approval and cloudy
[1:12:05] skies being the sign of God's
[1:12:07] disapproval but do you realize the very
[1:12:09] day is will disbelieve it still rain man
[1:12:12] out of heaven the very day that they
[1:12:16] went against the word the manna fell
[1:12:19] just the same so because you're getting
[1:12:21] blessed does it mean that you're in the
[1:12:23] will of God amen because you're getting
[1:12:25] blessed doesn't mean that you're that
[1:12:28] you're in the approval of God you got to
[1:12:29] come back to the plumb line which is the
[1:12:32] word and then I think of what David says
[1:12:34] in Psalm 37 37 he says mark the perfect
[1:12:38] man and behold the upright for the end
[1:12:40] of that man is peace and then see young
[1:12:43] people if I could share something with
[1:12:45] you that help me
[1:12:46] man it's marked somebody amen mark
[1:12:49] somebody that you see in this message
[1:12:51] mark somebody that you see this faithful
[1:12:53] don't mark people that show up when they
[1:12:55] walk - well let's have church we got up
[1:12:59] and got ready we might as well Amen
[1:13:01] don't mark people that church can't rely
[1:13:04] upon mark somebody and say God whatever
[1:13:06] they've got that keeps them going when
[1:13:09] the world is against them whatever
[1:13:11] they've got Amen that causes them to
[1:13:13] praise you is what I want in my life in
[1:13:17] my heart in my family I don't want to be
[1:13:19] a presume and believer I want to be a
[1:13:22] vindicated scriptural authority believer
[1:13:29] he says what we need today to be
[1:13:32] spiritual as a person that will humble
[1:13:34] themselves before God if they haven't
[1:13:36] got a penny they will pray to that
[1:13:39] spirit within them is satisfied with the
[1:13:41] goodness of God and the revival takes
[1:13:44] place only inside their heart that
[1:13:46] changes their attitudes and atmosphere
[1:13:48] that they live in now think of this
[1:13:51] Sampson was born under an hour's arrival
[1:13:54] but you realize what Samson done Sampson
[1:13:57] he began to presume when he lied to
[1:14:01] Delilah each time Sampson lied
[1:14:04] he had the false blaring nothing's going
[1:14:06] to happen nothing's gonna happen I'll
[1:14:10] just keep on lying I'll just keep on
[1:14:12] going and before long when they come
[1:14:14] time for power there was no power there
[1:14:16] you know why because the Prophet said
[1:14:19] Sampson presumed that he could just do
[1:14:21] anything and just get by with it
[1:14:23] why is the church world in the condition
[1:14:26] they're in this morning is because they
[1:14:27] presume that we can do what we want to
[1:14:29] and just get by with it but that's not
[1:14:32] coming from a voice of authority then he
[1:14:34] turns and says the same thing the church
[1:14:35] had when Samson arose and shook himself
[1:14:38] he found out God wasn't there let me see
[1:14:42] this one in church God does not presume
[1:14:44] but God consumes amen they'll say for
[1:14:48] our God is a consuming fire see it's
[1:14:51] consuming and you are God's sacrifice
[1:14:54] then how the supreme authority come to
[1:14:57] believer
[1:14:58] comes by the word or or listen or two to
[1:15:02] the believer with faith to receive the
[1:15:04] things that we pray for let's look here
[1:15:06] at mark 11:24 the Bible says therefore I
[1:15:09] say unto you what things you so ever you
[1:15:12] desire when you pray believe that you
[1:15:14] receive them and you shall have them now
[1:15:16] look at what this word receive means I'm
[1:15:18] I'm watching time something will be much
[1:15:19] longer will it cure what the word
[1:15:21] receive means it means to take with a
[1:15:23] hand to lay hold of any person or
[1:15:25] anything in order to use it to take up a
[1:15:27] thing to be carried to take up on
[1:15:28] oneself to take in order to carry away
[1:15:31] see it without the notion of violence
[1:15:34] now I just said this way our strength
[1:15:37] Amen lays in the full assurance that the
[1:15:40] God who made the promise is able to keep
[1:15:43] the promise that now Holy Ghost reveals
[1:15:46] himself to you by keeping his promise
[1:15:49] it's not shouting it's not dancing
[1:15:52] though we believe in those things so we
[1:15:54] love those things the Holy Ghost reveals
[1:15:57] himself to you by keeping his promise
[1:16:00] the brothers said through the Holy Ghost
[1:16:02] he said when there comes a time that God
[1:16:05] through the Holy Ghost reveals Christ
[1:16:06] back in the church with the power and
[1:16:09] demonstrations of healing the sick and
[1:16:11] making signs he said what if all the
[1:16:12] believers come to pass then Satan turns
[1:16:15] over in his bed he does something about
[1:16:17] it
[1:16:17] until that time Satan don't care how
[1:16:20] much church you join he don't care how
[1:16:22] much you do when Christ reveals to you
[1:16:25] cold-cut when Christ reveals to you that
[1:16:28] he is the son of God and the works that
[1:16:31] he did you do also not some other words
[1:16:35] but the same works
[1:16:37] seaton an authority comes by the
[1:16:39] identification of the Holy Ghost you say
[1:16:43] well Andrew nobody in the church will
[1:16:44] give me any time when that went well am
[1:16:48] I am i holding too long can I kind of
[1:16:50] few moments hey little brother Andrew
[1:16:52] I'll tell you what glory to God I got
[1:16:53] before somebody was demon-possessed and
[1:16:55] I looked him in the eyes and I told him
[1:16:57] Satan kind of and nothing happened if
[1:16:59] you ain't got the Holy Ghost the devil
[1:17:00] ain't scared of you
[1:17:02] if you ain't got the Holy Ghost it down
[1:17:04] you can you can throw Bibles you can put
[1:17:06] oil you can stomp you can spit I was

[1:17:59] things he said but bear what no one of
[1:18:01] them got the victory over us he said

[1:18:07] there was one raised up in a young man
[1:18:09] and he said there were people down there
[1:18:11] screaming and they were a holler and
[1:18:12] they were they were throwing all they

[1:18:23] and I walk down there and he said I
[1:18:25] looked at that boy that was had that
[1:18:26] demon in him and I looked him in the
[1:18:28] eyes and I looked at that demon and I
[1:18:29] said go and he said when I said go the
[1:18:32] boy fell limp and can I testify to you
[1:18:34] today that same boy it's still delivered
[1:18:37] and it's not how loud you holler it's
[1:18:41] not how much you throw it's an authority
[1:18:44] and the devil recognizes if our young
[1:18:47] people you want to do something the
[1:18:48] church get the Holy Ghost you want to
[1:18:51] change the atmosphere
[1:18:52] get the Holy Ghost it'll bring in a fire
[1:18:55] it'll settle a peace in your heart my
[1:18:59] what is supreme authority amen supreme
[1:19:01] authority is an office that someone
[1:19:04] holds that is superior to all others
[1:19:08] Amen don't get mad at me but if you got
[1:19:10] the Holy Ghost this morning you are more
[1:19:12] superior than Donald Trump
[1:19:14] if you've got the Holy Ghost this
[1:19:17] morning you've got more authority come
[1:19:20] on church we saw that manifestation of
[1:19:23] authority over in Finland when the
[1:19:25] doctor said he was dead and the
[1:19:27] paramedics were there and a prophet
[1:19:29] knelt down and said I'd been here before
[1:19:31] I'd seen this intervention brother BAM
[1:19:33] didn't run around jumping screaming
[1:19:35] aiming to kick in the boy a man pulling
[1:19:37] cars over
[1:19:38] he said Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:19:40] Christ I assure you and I called for
[1:19:42] life amen to come back in this boy's
[1:19:45] body and the boy got up come on church
[1:19:49] brother wait I love to tell that story
[1:19:52] but you know what brother Dale my
[1:19:54] favorite part to tell about that story
[1:19:56] is when the problem that God said you
[1:19:57] could line to every devil in hell up you
[1:20:01] could line to everyone including the
[1:20:02] devil himself and you still could have
[1:20:06] not stopped that boy from raising back
[1:20:09] to life oh then spoken words hurts may I
[1:20:13] tell you this morning let ever demon in
[1:20:16] Hell let ever imp inhale let ever dark
[1:20:19] spirited hell surround itself around
[1:20:21] this building but if the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:23] here this morning the devil don't stand
[1:20:26] a chance
[1:20:31] oh I'm rejoicing this morning to know
[1:20:34] there is no limits on God amen all power
[1:20:37] is given unto me in heaven earth go you
[1:20:39] therefore teach all nations baptizing
[1:20:42] them in the name of the Father the Son
[1:20:43] the Holy Ghost and teach them to observe
[1:20:46] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:20:48] you and lo I am with You alway even at

[1:21:16] act upon his authority he said see he
[1:21:18] stands behind them that's you this
[1:21:20] morning what brother and are the only
[1:21:22] person with authority was those seven
[1:21:23] messengers but get this there was not a
[1:21:26] Holy Ghost that Paul had and then a
[1:21:28] different Holy Ghost for the Ephesians
[1:21:29] and that the same Holy Ghost that Paul
[1:21:32] had was the same Holy Ghost the
[1:21:35] Ephesians had and I'm going to bring it
[1:21:37] to today the same Holy Ghost that
[1:21:39] William Branham had it's the same Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost young man you gots they then the
[1:21:44] same Holy Ghost is here this morning he
[1:21:48] still heals the sick for the Lord he
[1:21:50] still casts out Devils
[1:21:51] he still gives the Holy Ghost he still
[1:21:54] changes hearts he still restores
[1:21:56] marriages I say this morning that the
[1:21:59] same pillar of fire come in this
[1:22:01] building and dry that area and believe
[1:22:03] in spirit and watch God give you an
[1:22:06] authority over that spirit against you
[1:22:10] there's a voice of authority coming this
[1:22:13] day that said no need to look back look
[1:22:19] up
[1:22:21] don't look back to Alan and Cole and and
[1:22:24] schambach oh no look up aint better look
[1:22:28] up amen because the same God that was
[1:22:31] here with William random it's the god of
[1:22:33] the larger dead is the God of Elijah
[1:22:36] dead Elijah's God is not dead he's here
[1:22:39] this morning their authority headship
[1:22:46] leadership direction has come my you
[1:22:51] love him this morning a man we're not a
[1:22:56] headless body this morning
[1:22:58] we got a direction we're not going in
[1:23:01] circles this morning we know who we are
[1:23:03] we know what we believe
[1:23:05] Rylander how can you say that Amen I'm
[1:23:08] just gonna I'm just gonna go ahead go
[1:23:09] here even because I believe we're here
[1:23:11] this morning you look at revelation
[1:23:13] tenth chapter I'm gonna close with this
[1:23:16] here revelation tenth chapter in the
[1:23:19] first verse we are that body but without
[1:23:25] a head a body is going nowhere without a
[1:23:29] head the body does not function without
[1:23:32] a head
[1:23:33] there is no operation but when headship
[1:23:36] comes Authority comes look with me in
[1:23:39] Revelation 10 1 and I saw another mighty
[1:23:43] angel come down from heaven a man
[1:23:45] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:23:49] upon his head and his face was as it
[1:23:51] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:23:54] fire
[1:23:54] now how many knows but I was going to
[1:23:56] come in 1965 and preach a message called
[1:23:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled now
[1:24:03] it amazed me brother Dale is that real
[1:24:05] event actually preaches that in Arizona
[1:24:06] in January then he comes to
[1:24:09] Jeffersonville in February and preaches
[1:24:10] it again now if you listen to it in
[1:24:12] Arizona for the way sometimes I listen
[1:24:15] to that about cry you know why because
[1:24:17] the Prophet is preaching the word and
[1:24:19] they're not saying man it's like it's
[1:24:21] like it's just going out and falling
[1:24:23] that you don't hear no response amen but
[1:24:26] notice what he does he takes that same
[1:24:28] message back to Jeffersonville and he
[1:24:32] takes a Luke the fourth chapter
[1:24:34] he said as it was the custom of the Lord
[1:24:36] Jesus he went into the temple on the
[1:24:38] Sabbath and he found the place that was
[1:24:41] written and he read notice where Jesus
[1:24:44] when he went back remember subscription
[1:24:46] of compound meaning rights he went back
[1:24:48] to the place he come out of Jesus went
[1:24:51] back to the place that probably
[1:24:53] ridiculed him the most was the very
[1:24:55] place that he had dinner fide himself
[1:24:57] from the word as the Messiah they didn't
[1:25:02] tell me the RAM in Arizona that
[1:25:04] Tabernacle is going to be a car garage
[1:25:06] but in Jeffersonville they said in just
[1:25:08] a few days they meant that that car grab
[1:25:10] that building will be a car garage amen
[1:25:13] but a prophet comes back and he says but
[1:25:15] around the world from this pulpit has
[1:25:17] gone a message that is built revival
[1:25:20] tires up on every hill and he takes
[1:25:23] Revelation 10:1 and he says and another
[1:25:25] mighty angel comes down
[1:25:27] now how many knows that actually
[1:25:28] happened in 1963 I went back and asked
[1:25:31] the brother if he could give me that
[1:25:33] picture before but when when it first
[1:25:36] appeared in Life magazine when you see
[1:25:38] this here and then I'm gonna close with
[1:25:40] this but I feel good whew but when you
[1:25:45] see this picture here it appears there
[1:25:47] in Arizona and the font of God said they
[1:25:49] took pictures of it he said they studied
[1:25:51] it he said kids was let out of school
[1:25:53] now what is this brother it's a symbol
[1:25:56] it's a symbol there's a symbol here rub
[1:25:59] em said see he said it appeared there he
[1:26:02] said now it but but if you look at it
[1:26:04] it's a symbol what does it mean nothing
[1:26:06] mean here's ever heard of a name brother
[1:26:07] Ed hunter for that hunter is actually
[1:26:09] out of money in the end he's a pastor
[1:26:11] they're retired now the brother Ed was
[1:26:13] actually from Texas and he followed
[1:26:14] brother brems meetings he would drive
[1:26:16] from Texas I live here him and sister
[1:26:18] Billy talked about it let's say we had
[1:26:20] to go from Texas all the way to
[1:26:22] Jeffersonville and back brother had said
[1:26:24] now people won't drive the six minutes
[1:26:25] to go to church heesu we were driving
[1:26:27] about 16 hours he said but there was he
[1:26:30] said there was such a quickening power
[1:26:31] there there was such a fire coming he
[1:26:34] said well Andrew he said I remember
[1:26:35] after this picture was taken he said
[1:26:38] that it began to get among the people
[1:26:39] member amen they made copies of it now
[1:26:42] what I love about this is brother had
[1:26:43] said they had pictures on the morning of
[1:26:45] the rising of the Sun 1965
[1:26:47] he said they had pictures out front I
[1:26:49] actually went out and sit down with him
[1:26:50] I super then I want you to tell me
[1:26:51] that's the way your memories
[1:26:52] he got happy telling it again he
[1:26:54] surrendered he said they had pictures he
[1:26:56] was all out from the tabernacle he was
[1:26:58] all looking at him he said people was
[1:27:00] running around there saying do you see
[1:27:02] that angel he said then one run over and
[1:27:04] say do you see this he said everybody
[1:27:06] was out there he said they were turn it
[1:27:07] this way and that way and look at he
[1:27:09] said they were looking every which way
[1:27:10] and they weren't seeing what they were
[1:27:12] supposed to see he said so we all came
[1:27:14] in the tabernacle and he said brother
[1:27:16] Evan gets up and says now there's a
[1:27:17] picture gotten out what was taking place
[1:27:19] there he said I went to Jack Moore and I
[1:27:22] said Jack what is this he said man
[1:27:24] that's Jesus Christ his glorified body
[1:27:26] he said that bit and ring a bell you
[1:27:28] know why because no offense but Jack
[1:27:30] Moore was a theologian but the word of
[1:27:33] the Lord comes to a prophet he meant the
[1:27:37] revelation of the word comes to a
[1:27:38] prophet and the Prophet said and I went
[1:27:40] back in my room and then he came he came
[1:27:45] and he said now take that picture and
[1:27:48] turn it to the right he said no when I
[1:27:51] turned it to the rides there it is and I
[1:27:53] love these next words he says that's our
[1:27:55] Lord up there
[1:27:57] hey that's our Lord up there and what is
[1:28:00] our Lord our Lord his headship come on
[1:28:04] church when you see that oh brother they
[1:28:07] can call it smoke they can call it a
[1:28:10] cloud they can call it a fiction of our
[1:28:12] imagination but there is one and then
[1:28:14] there is one young guy here in front of
[1:28:16] you this morning that they will never
[1:28:18] talk me out of that because it has
[1:28:20] become more than a symbol it is headship
[1:28:23] I love what he says he says and since
[1:28:26] the revelation come our home has not
[1:28:29] been without one over the Ender that's a

[1:28:43] but to the bride its headship
[1:28:48] it's Christ it's our Lord its direction
[1:28:57] it's a prophet announcing the days of
[1:29:01] presuming is over presuming days are

[1:29:28] what is it
[1:29:30] direction is coming let me just leave
[1:29:33] you at this this morning message
[1:29:35] churches are not just churches they're
[1:29:41] the only place left on the earth that
[1:29:44] there is still a thority when it comes
[1:29:50] to Christianity brother Andrew you're
[1:29:55] getting pretty you're getting pretty far
[1:29:56] out there with the message well I'll
[1:29:58] tell you why because if it never becomes
[1:30:00] a reality to you somehow I'll talk you
[1:30:03] out of it I've been there I've been
[1:30:08] there I get my heart Lord I was nine
[1:30:10] years old nine years old started
[1:30:12] preached when I was 13 raised in the
[1:30:14] message brother I heard tapes all my
[1:30:17] life heard the message I knew it I heard
[1:30:19] it but there's gonna come a time you got
[1:30:23] to make a stand
[1:30:26] brother now I had this idea that we
[1:30:28] preach and travel when the Lord called
[1:30:30] me Gras
[1:30:30] I never could come to concept that what
[1:30:35] I heard on those tapes
[1:30:36] if you preached it people disagree with
[1:30:38] you really I couldn't wrap my mind I
[1:30:43] thought my lord is a vindicated prophet
[1:30:45] it's coming from the scriptures man when
[1:30:48] I heard him say you're the sinless
[1:30:49] spotless bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:30:50] couldn't wait to get to a pulpit and say
[1:30:53] and it's a church do you know what a
[1:30:54] prophet said about you he said you the
[1:30:56] bride you don't have one sin against you
[1:30:59] well berliner you gotta be careful yeah
[1:31:02] but here's what I've come to and this is
[1:31:04] where you've got to come to a revelation
[1:31:06] in your heart but if the closest person
[1:31:10] to you tries to talk you out of it
[1:31:13] you'll say you're not taking my
[1:31:14] authority you're not taking my authority
[1:31:19] this message is our authority probably
[1:31:21] God close sisters Jesus Christ is in
[1:31:23] this building tonight
[1:31:24] he said perform miracles but he does it
[1:31:27] through his churches people they shall
[1:31:29] lay their hands on the sick and they
[1:31:30] shall recover in my name they shall cast
[1:31:31] out evil spirits is that right the
[1:31:33] Commission's given to the church that's
[1:31:34] what the matter with the church today it
[1:31:36] doesn't know its position if you know
[1:31:41] positionally who you was and what you
[1:31:45] are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble
[1:31:47] person in here in the next five minutes
[1:31:52] that's right the thing of it is you're
[1:31:54] looking off into a millennium for
[1:31:56] something to happen when it's already
[1:31:58] here now we are the sons of God not we
[1:32:04] will be we are right now when this not
[1:32:06] right now this minute we were seated
[1:32:07] together and handle their places in
[1:32:08] Christ Jesus so if you'd only recognize
[1:32:10] that and the supreme authority and the
[1:32:14] supreme aside less a supreme authority
[1:32:17] that Jesus Christ has given to every
[1:32:20] believer anything you have desire of
[1:32:24] need of only thing you have to do is ask
[1:32:28] and then run around and jump and holler
[1:32:31] and try to figure out we believe in
[1:32:34] those things but a prophet said ask and
[1:32:37] receive it what several things you
[1:32:41] desire when you pray believe I say this
[1:32:45] morning Church let this message become
[1:32:49] more than a symbol
[1:32:51] let it become a reality let it let it

[1:34:15] change one thing in that picture when he
[1:34:19] turned to the right he didn't change one
[1:34:21] detail in that picture what changed the
[1:34:26] way he was looking at it the position of
[1:34:30] it I know this is simple and I know
[1:34:32] you've heard this hundreds of times
[1:34:35] remember Eber I'm talking about that
[1:34:37] sculptor he said he was all looking at
[1:34:39] it couldn't see it they were looking at
[1:34:41] and looking at and looking at it and
[1:34:42] they couldn't see it they couldn't see
[1:34:43] it they're trying to figure it out he
[1:34:44] said man come by he said my brother he
[1:34:46] says actually what you got to do is you
[1:34:48] got to get down he said then you got to
[1:34:50] look up he's problem was they were
[1:34:52] standing up looking down he said had to
[1:34:55] get down look up
[1:34:57] don't you thank God for a simple profit
[1:35:00] just get down and look up oh brother I
[1:35:04] don't understand all this I don't

[1:35:21] lady that's actually look at it holding
[1:35:22] his standards if she's looking at it
[1:35:25] from standing up looking down she's
[1:35:26] gonna argue with it when she gets down
[1:35:30] humbles herself to the word it says Lord
[1:35:34] this is your word I humbled myself to it
[1:35:37] I believe personally this morning a
[1:35:43] great victory in a lot of hearts and
[1:35:45] lives could be a good dose and baptism
[1:35:50] of humility humble myself humble thyself
[1:35:56] in this something really Dale where the
[1:36:00] paper says the cry of the ages I'm wrong
[1:36:03] when everybody's screaming I'm right I'm
[1:36:05] right I'm right that probably comes
[1:36:07] along and says but what you should be
[1:36:09] saying is I'm wrong I'm wrong her two
[1:36:14] brothers say one time it's always stuck
[1:36:15] with me it's become real to me he said
[1:36:18] sometimes I'll get down the study or sit
[1:36:19] in my office to study he said one thing
[1:36:21] I realized I do is I do a lot of
[1:36:22] repenting a little bit of studying yeah
[1:36:25] I'm wrong but Bertram's right I was
[1:36:28] looking at it wrong but that's right you
[1:36:32] want to fall in love with Jesus again

[1:36:52] Holy Ghost take the symbols you're
