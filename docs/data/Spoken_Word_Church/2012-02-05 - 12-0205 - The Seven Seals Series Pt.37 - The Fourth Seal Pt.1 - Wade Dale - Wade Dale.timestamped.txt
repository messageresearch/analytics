[0:38] thank brother
[0:39] bob for

[2:04] yeah ryan's in there
[2:06] i don't know we're just we're saving him
[2:09] he's a rookie silver you know he's
[2:10] picking on bob right now we red shirted
[2:12] him we red shirted him be the freshman
[2:17] and uh
[2:19] i gotta still pick on bob i can't start
[2:21] picking on ryan yet so
[2:24] but we're going to try to take this for
[2:26] seal and go through it pretty quick
[2:29] and
[2:30] not spend a lot of time on it maybe a
[2:32] couple of two or three
[2:35] time so revelation chapter 6
[2:38] when opened the fourth seal i heard the
[2:39] voice of the fourth beast say come and
[2:41] see
[2:43] look and behold a pale horse
[2:46] and his name that set on him was death
[2:49] and hell followed with it
[2:51] and power was given
[2:53] unto them
[2:54] over the fourth part of the earth to
[2:56] kill with the sword and with hunger and
[2:57] with death
[2:58] and with the beast of the earth now
[3:00] let's turn to matthew
[3:02] and catch the uh
[3:05] where jesus was talking on the
[3:09] speaking on the seals itself
[3:13] matthew 24.
[3:16] we know that verse
[3:18] four and five is the first seal six is
[3:20] the second
[3:22] seventh verse is the third seal
[3:25] and here we are in the fourth seal which
[3:26] will be verse nine
[3:31] matthew 24 9.
[3:34] then shall they deliver you up to be
[3:36] afflicted and shall kill you
[3:39] and you shall be hated of all nations
[3:42] for my name's sake
[3:44] all right there's the fourth seal now
[3:46] let's get our symbols
[3:48] real quick
[3:51] the fourth steal of course we got
[3:52] matthew 24 9
[3:54] powell was given to him to white to take
[3:56] to kill with a sword and hunger death
[3:58] and the beast symbol was a pale horse
[4:01] which is what white red and black mixed
[4:03] together
[4:04] all right
[4:05] he had a name his name was death
[4:08] he was not named now remember he was
[4:10] death back here
[4:12] in the first seal he was death in the
[4:14] second death in the third right
[4:17] but in the fourth steal he gets a name
[4:21] all right the combat beast is the eagle
[4:23] and the eagle anointing is the only way
[4:25] that this
[4:26] person can be brought to light
[4:30] or be
[4:31] exposed
[4:33] in the end time
[4:35] because no other wesley luther
[4:39] they never could they couldn't preach
[4:40] the seals and know that the cells were
[4:43] the very antichrist that was working in
[4:44] their own in their own system
[4:47] all right but god had a true
[4:49] he had a true
[4:51] bride through all those church ages
[4:53] but in this age which is the seventh age
[4:56] is the parallel the fourth seal because
[4:58] why
[5:00] what was the combat beast eagle after
[5:02] the eagle is there any other combat
[5:04] thing
[5:06] no no more combat beats
[5:08] so brother branham knew then he see he
[5:10] was on that fourth seal when he gets to
[5:11] the fifth seal he looks back on the
[5:13] fourth steal
[5:14] showing that the rapture takes place on
[5:16] the fourth seal
[5:18] all right now people go bonkers and
[5:19] cuckoo over there but just let's keep it
[5:21] in line
[5:24] four combat beats
[5:26] four
[5:29] writers
[5:30] white black white red black and pale
[5:34] they ate the word down so much
[5:36] right
[5:38] go back to joel
[5:40] joel says i will restore
[5:42] what the cankerworm palm worm
[5:44] caterpillar locust which was the four
[5:46] beasts
[5:47] or horse riders
[5:50] that rode out in opposition to the four
[5:52] that was going to
[5:54] bring it back
[5:55] all right
[5:56] which was the lion the ox the man and
[5:58] the eagle
[6:00] all right everybody got that
[6:02] so
[6:03] i mean it ought to be we ought to know
[6:04] these things but that's okay we got a
[6:06] lot of new ones so
[6:07] so we need to go slow we'll we'll go a
[6:10] little bit slower
[6:12] but
[6:13] you don't see any more combat beasts
[6:15] because we're going to maybe next sunday
[6:16] we're going to go into the book of
[6:17] ezekiel
[6:19] and watch what they did
[6:21] and watch what happened those those
[6:23] combat beasts went up
[6:25] and you see a man
[6:29] son of man
[6:30] all right he said well how do you get
[6:32] four
[6:33] if if four he did it down four had to
[6:35] restore it he said well what's the four
[6:37] you know brother that was hitting on it
[6:39] he's making quotes because he's headed
[6:41] towards him he's making comments
[6:43] justification sanctification the baptism
[6:45] of the holy ghost and the word
[6:48] the word had to be restored the holy
[6:50] ghost was restored to a degree
[6:52] it was a down payment remember the
[6:54] earnest of our inheritance in ephesians
[6:56] the baptism of the holy ghost is your
[6:58] earnest
[6:59] but that's not the full
[7:00] possession the full possession is when
[7:02] we all get nothing when the fourth
[7:05] or the eagle comes on the same
[7:09] reveals
[7:11] god
[7:12] to the people
[7:13] like never before
[7:15] and shows that we can take a body change
[7:17] the other ones couldn't do that
[7:19] but it shows the eagle had to go higher
[7:21] to see things to show us
[7:24] what all these names are and how they
[7:26] all fit together
[7:28] so the rapture takes place in the fourth
[7:30] seal but it takes all seven to go in the
[7:32] rapture
[7:34] right
[7:36] with the change of the body
[7:39] takes all seven
[7:41] one two three four the rapture
[7:44] justification baptism holy ghost and the
[7:46] word
[7:47] that's full restoration back
[7:49] to power all right
[7:51] but then there's five six and seven
[7:52] which we'll get into and that's why i
[7:54] want to get to four and then i'll have
[7:56] this
[7:56] gap where i'll be you know teaching some
[7:59] on sundays upstairs
[8:01] on a different subject but i want five
[8:03] six and seven is very important seal
[8:06] very important seal
[8:07] so we may take and just take a little
[8:09] time and let's coast a little bit and
[8:10] let these other brothers come in
[8:12] and they're all doing a wonderful job as
[8:14] far as i'm concerned
[8:17] teaching you sunday school that's what
[8:18] this is sunday school not preaching this
[8:20] teaching sunday school class and they're
[8:22] doing a very good job but then we'll
[8:23] start when i get a little more time
[8:25] maybe in april when i'm not going
[8:26] anywhere
[8:27] we'll take three four five
[8:30] maybe months
[8:31] and go through five six and seven but if
[8:33] you get one two three and four let's get
[8:35] those down because that takes us
[8:37] interactive
[8:40] the thing of it is the holy ghost was
[8:42] not yeah
[8:44] the holy ghost was not eat down it was
[8:46] the word right then you don't eat the
[8:48] holy ghost it was just
[8:51] covered up because there wasn't much
[8:53] word there but it wasn't eat
[8:56] it was the effect the word had on the
[8:58] people the word has never been
[9:01] less powerful
[9:03] but satan can infiltrate and water it
[9:05] down through all these white red what
[9:10] deception
[9:12] that's what satan does he deceives eve
[9:14] like we were talking about last night in
[9:15] the bible study you know he deceived
[9:18] he deceives that's what he does he does
[9:20] have some truth the tree of knowledge of
[9:22] good and evil satan come tell you some
[9:25] things that are true that's right
[9:28] he told eve everything that was true it
[9:29] said one word
[9:31] not
[9:32] he quoted
[9:33] the very thing god told eve he just put
[9:36] that word not because god said you shall
[9:38] surely die
[9:40] you watch in the bible say it says you
[9:42] shall not
[9:43] surely
[9:44] die
[9:46] same word that god
[9:48] spoke
[9:49] added one word to it
[9:51] one word caused the whole follow this
[9:53] whole thing we ought to know that
[9:56] the word not you shall not surely die
[9:59] and then she took that in and it became
[10:00] part over so that was where the fall
[10:03] happened that's where all the satan
[10:06] started injecting himself in the human
[10:08] race
[10:09] and
[10:10] then you see down through the ages after
[10:12] jesus came along jesus
[10:14] jesus was the seals so he was walking on
[10:17] the earth with the seals
[10:19] but then he had to allotted out to each
[10:20] church age he had a seven groups he had
[10:23] to talk to
[10:25] remember revelations two and three
[10:29] and to the church of and to the church
[10:31] of and to the church he was giving a
[10:33] part of himself out to that church age
[10:35] but it wasn't the fullness
[10:38] because satan was riding started riding
[10:40] in that first church age right along
[10:42] with the holy ghost
[10:43] in opposition so he was he was keeping
[10:46] the people it's like it's like mama said
[10:48] it's not that the word became less
[10:49] powerful
[10:50] satan just sugar coated it
[10:53] you know that
[10:54] and in in
[10:57] plant life just for an example
[10:59] you take a you take a plant and we do
[11:01] with our food plots we have to uh
[11:03] there's a ph balance in the soil
[11:07] fertilizer is good for
[11:09] plants and good to grow stuff right
[11:11] fertilizer everybody knows fertilizer is
[11:13] good to grow things
[11:14] but you know if you throw that
[11:15] fertilizer out and your alkaline your ph
[11:18] level is high
[11:20] actually that alkaline takes that
[11:23] takes that little ball of fertilizer you
[11:26] see
[11:27] didn't hit me
[11:28] it took that little ball of fertilizer
[11:30] that you see
[11:32] and it actually encapsulates it with
[11:34] alkaline
[11:37] fertilizer does no good
[11:39] none whatsoever
[11:41] you can put 2 000 pounds
[11:44] per acre of fertilizer
[11:46] and no lime
[11:48] to drop your ph
[11:50] and you've wasted
[11:51] see that's what it is about the word of
[11:52] god the word of god has been put out
[11:54] there and it's it's for our soul but if
[11:56] you let satan take in and just put that
[11:59] little
[11:59] put that little alkaline on it put that
[12:01] little acid
[12:03] that's what he does right he fills us
[12:05] with acid the prophet said he'll come in
[12:07] they'll fill you with acid
[12:09] put you in a congregation and fill you
[12:10] with acid
[12:12] and then you know what you've got a
[12:13] dysfunctional church so
[12:16] that's the same way you can see in what
[12:18] we do in a natural
[12:20] but if you throw the lime out there drop
[12:23] the ph of the soil
[12:24] once you put that fertilizer down it
[12:26] automatically starts breaking down into
[12:28] nutrients
[12:30] but if you don't same way with the word
[12:33] you can throw the word out
[12:36] but if you haven't got something to
[12:37] water if you if you ain't got that ph
[12:39] level down
[12:41] you know if you haven't got if you
[12:42] haven't got some spirit to go along with
[12:43] that word
[12:46] you're just casting your you know you
[12:48] can't you know that's why i said don't
[12:49] cast your pearls before it's
[12:51] that's why you don't do that you know
[12:54] but that's the same way with with the
[12:55] seals
[12:57] the seals have always been here
[13:00] brother they'll prove the seals were in
[13:02] genesis we preached it many times where
[13:03] the seals was right there in abel and
[13:06] kane
[13:07] showing exactly how that the the four
[13:10] horse riders were right there in in
[13:12] genesis chapter four
[13:14] right
[13:15] so the seals have been here since
[13:16] genesis
[13:18] it's just been what satan has
[13:21] made it of known effect you know what
[13:23] the scripture says you have made it the
[13:26] pharisees you've got the they had the
[13:27] very word handled the very word of god
[13:30] but they made it of non-effect by what
[13:32] their traditions their their traditions
[13:34] just went and encapsulated that word and
[13:36] would not let it out
[13:39] so that's the way it is with you and i
[13:41] but somewhere down the line
[13:44] everything's got to balance out we come
[13:46] up here to this eagle age and
[13:47] everything's going to balance out
[13:50] simply because there's no more ages to
[13:52] go there's no more people to come why
[13:55] haven't you been a problem that's why
[13:56] that eagle had to fly higher and be and
[13:58] be able to see all the way to genesis
[14:01] i see luther could have preached genesis
[14:03] but he could not have preached it and
[14:05] broke the seals down in the book of
[14:06] genesis
[14:08] sorry
[14:09] the revelation was there it's just satan
[14:12] had a hit
[14:13] right
[14:14] satan had it here
[14:16] in a white righteous church that
[14:18] everybody thought was good and
[14:19] everything was going great but no satan
[14:21] was sitting right there and he was
[14:22] eating
[14:23] same way with you and i that's why these
[14:25] seals have got to release us
[14:28] when you come down to here when you come
[14:30] down to finish up with a pale horse
[14:32] which is nothing but what we've talked
[14:34] mixed together
[14:36] that's the highest form right
[14:39] what we've taught about the first three
[14:41] white righteous church red killing the
[14:45] people and death killing the people
[14:46] killing people physically in the red the
[14:49] second seal then killing people
[14:51] spiritually
[14:53] in the third seal and then we've come up
[14:54] to here to where now
[14:56] is going to be a beast
[14:58] which is satan incarnate in a human
[15:00] being
[15:01] but we've also come to the to the place
[15:03] to where god
[15:05] can be
[15:07] manifest or
[15:09] incarnate in a human being
[15:11] that's what god always wanted
[15:13] he just couldn't do it down through the
[15:14] ages because they just they just had
[15:17] little bitty
[15:18] little bitty holes they could see
[15:19] through
[15:21] you remember the story brother around
[15:22] home
[15:23] about the boy looking through the
[15:24] knothole he just see a little bit of the
[15:26] circus
[15:27] but what happened when that other boy
[15:28] got on his shoulders and looked over the
[15:30] fence my saw the whole circus this
[15:32] little boy was just watching one in the
[15:34] light well that's what luther was doing
[15:35] he was looking through glass
[15:37] a little bitty glass
[15:38] wesley was looking through a little
[15:40] bitty glass
[15:41] pentecost was looking through a little
[15:42] bitty glass but when brother brown came
[15:44] the holy ghost came himself
[15:47] at pentecost but they stopped the holy
[15:50] ghost didn't they stopped the holy ghost
[15:52] kept riding into into brother branham
[15:54] just say that i don't don't mind saying
[15:57] that the holy ghost kept riding got off
[15:59] you know he rode on and he got on
[16:01] brother brown
[16:02] took the message of
[16:04] the water baptism and
[16:06] one god what happened in the garden of
[16:08] eden and all that they believed that
[16:09] some of them back in the in the early
[16:11] 80s but he took it on to something else
[16:14] something more he opened that um he
[16:17] whipped that top off of that pyramid
[16:19] remember and opened it up and looked
[16:21] down in there and he said there was
[16:22] writings that man had never seen well
[16:24] see luke had never seen it wesley's
[16:26] never seen him pentecost had never seen
[16:27] it in that fullness why he was an eagle
[16:30] he could fly up here look down at the
[16:32] things where man had to be a certain
[16:34] distance and if he saw a big old
[16:35] mountain he can't look over it
[16:38] so he his revelation stopped
[16:41] lying
[16:43] can just barely see over the grass as
[16:45] powerful as he is though he can't see
[16:46] over the grass
[16:48] ox is a little bit higher he can see a
[16:49] little bit he can see over the grass but
[16:52] he can't see as far as man can
[16:54] and man can artificially climb up things
[16:56] but an eagle can go way up higher than
[16:58] that
[16:59] go completely outside you know so here
[17:01] here we see a title that god showed us
[17:03] through animals
[17:05] how he's bringing the church back
[17:08] through the line the boldness of the
[17:09] line the the labor of the odds how we
[17:11] all labor with each other you know we've
[17:13] been around a long time we've still
[17:15] labored the man we gotta have
[17:17] intelligence
[17:18] for the word of god and then the eagle
[17:20] which is
[17:21] the one that sees everything and that's
[17:23] the anointing that we have now we're
[17:25] under the equal age anointing
[17:27] and
[17:30] for that to happen
[17:33] there had to become a prophet
[17:34] that's why brother brown had to come as
[17:36] that kind of prophet to see above
[17:39] everything and come back and show it to
[17:40] us he didn't just see it for himself and
[17:42] leave
[17:43] he saw it for himself and then brought
[17:45] it to the people that were still back on
[17:47] the earth
[17:49] per se in our revelation we were still
[17:51] earthbound he was heaven-bound
[17:54] but he was what he wasn't he didn't say
[17:56] well this is what it is and then he flew
[17:58] off no he called us eaglets
[18:00] he called us little messiahs little
[18:02] prophets little priests
[18:04] told us to come up that's what john said
[18:06] there
[18:07] and saw in
[18:09] revelations 4 come up higher come up
[18:11] hither
[18:12] in other words after the church ages so
[18:14] the church age ends
[18:15] on the seventh i mean on the fourth seal
[18:17] of the church agents because this is
[18:19] parallel with the church age
[18:21] the wicked one
[18:22] how much have we seen death and hell on
[18:24] the earth
[18:26] nobody's ever seen it this bad before
[18:28] nobody
[18:30] there was there was things in back you
[18:32] know in the ages that were you always
[18:35] had prostitutes but they were always
[18:36] under the table you may have already
[18:38] always had
[18:39] gay people but they were always under
[18:41] the table but look at it now that's
[18:43] right
[18:45] it's actually hell on earth i mean this
[18:46] is what hell's going to be
[18:49] in a perverted form not where we're at
[18:51] now it's going away it's going somewhere
[18:53] else because we're going we're going to
[18:54] reside on this earth
[18:56] but look at death and hell on earth and
[18:58] that's exactly what it is
[19:01] but if we don't take a body change the
[19:02] death is right here
[19:04] you ain't got to worry about looking at
[19:06] a naked woman or or somebody that's
[19:08] that's uh you know
[19:09] doing things wrong like sodom and
[19:11] gomorrah you better worry about this guy
[19:12] right here
[19:14] because we're all if we're all born
[19:16] again we're all going into rapture
[19:17] that's right
[19:19] that's a given right
[19:20] we're born again we're all going to go
[19:22] on a rapture that's why i got that those
[19:24] uh names back there i want those people
[19:26] to go on a rapture
[19:27] i want those people to be
[19:29] born again christians
[19:31] not just say i hope i'm going to go
[19:34] right
[19:35] not just say i hope i got a chance to go
[19:39] that's why you know dad told and i'll
[19:41] tell you tell them up front too if
[19:43] you're embarrassed because your kids are
[19:45] on there then you've got a problem
[19:46] yourself that's right
[19:48] i say you're not born again yourself
[19:51] why i want my kids saved whether god
[19:53] saves me or not i want my kids say
[19:57] and some of some other people that put
[19:59] their name on the list that i would say
[20:00] is born again but they want to make sure
[20:03] your wife
[20:05] gary atkins
[20:08] but they want to make sure
[20:11] make sure
[20:12] that they're born again
[20:14] whether you whether you understand the
[20:16] seals or understand this or understand
[20:18] that
[20:19] people were born again and didn't
[20:21] understand
[20:22] harley water baptism
[20:25] all right
[20:27] peter preached a sermon
[20:30] he said repent and be baptized in the
[20:31] name of jesus christ and the bible said
[20:32] the holy ghost fell on the people i'm
[20:34] sure they went and got baptized
[20:37] but
[20:39] they went got baptized but they weren't
[20:40] baptized you know we think
[20:43] the water baptism sometimes i think we
[20:45] think that cure is a cure-all it's not
[20:49] you'll be baptized and go to hell
[20:51] in the name of jesus christ every day of
[20:53] your life that's right
[20:55] we baptize a lot that we baptize the
[20:57] name of jesus christ
[20:59] that we never see again
[21:02] so guess what
[21:04] their fruits prove who they were
[21:07] that did not change that's what i was
[21:08] telling a
[21:10] a girl it worked there
[21:13] i said if i baptize you the bible says
[21:15] you're supposed to change
[21:17] walk in newness of life you read listen
[21:19] to the scripture daddy reads when he
[21:21] baptizes somebody
[21:22] the scripture is you go down
[21:25] you lay everything out you're dead
[21:28] that's why that third seal was death you
[21:30] lay that thing out first you got to die
[21:32] first and when you come up you come up
[21:34] in newness of life you're not supposed
[21:35] to do the things you did before they put
[21:37] you under that water
[21:38] because that person's supposed to be
[21:40] dead
[21:42] completely empty
[21:45] not just baptize somebody and then
[21:48] you don't see them ever again
[21:52] you know me
[21:54] be a waste of time
[21:58] want to talk to somebody i baptize
[21:59] anybody wants to be baptized but i sure
[22:01] would like to sit down for about an hour
[22:03] and just really talk to him
[22:05] and then say do you really still want to
[22:06] do this
[22:08] because you're we're supposed to see
[22:10] more of you once we baptize you not less
[22:14] right
[22:15] isn't that the truth
[22:17] policy
[22:18] yeah it's not an insurance policy you're
[22:20] not guaranteed to go to heaven if you
[22:21] baptize the name of jesus christ
[22:24] it's not a guarantee that's right the
[22:26] bible says repent
[22:29] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[22:31] christ repent means to what
[22:33] around going another direction right
[22:38] i was baptized when i was a little kid
[22:39] but you know when i come back to the
[22:40] lord that's the first thing i want to do
[22:42] is be baptized again
[22:44] you know why
[22:46] my conscience wasn't clear then i didn't
[22:47] come up a good boy when i was baptized
[22:50] at 12 years old
[22:52] when i was when i was baptized at 38
[22:54] years old
[22:56] i came up in newness of life because
[22:58] everything around me changed
[23:00] i didn't have the same of course sure we
[23:02] were babies and we still made mistakes
[23:04] and all that but you got that's that's a
[23:07] good conscious but it actually supposed
[23:09] to push you towards something that's
[23:11] right same way with these seals i'm
[23:12] making a point i'm not really off my
[23:14] point that's what these seals are for
[23:15] they're pushing you to a point
[23:18] of a body change we've never had that
[23:20] before but these seals are pushing us
[23:23] toward
[23:24] if we don't have justification forget
[23:26] about
[23:27] seal
[23:29] two through seven forget about it get
[23:31] justified
[23:34] if you're not sanctified
[23:36] forget about seal
[23:38] three through seven
[23:40] i'm just that way i'm just i i just see
[23:43] some people that talk about the lord all
[23:45] the time and then they like brother
[23:46] claude said they live a hound no wife
[23:48] don't talk to me about the lord
[23:51] if you live a hound all life
[23:54] get your life straight
[23:56] i'll help you get your life straight
[23:58] then we'll talk about the lord
[24:00] but you talk about the lord and level
[24:01] and live a life contrary to what you're
[24:03] talking about
[24:05] i guess that's just something
[24:07] i just ain't been able to take it right
[24:08] you're supposed to have brotherly
[24:09] kindness
[24:11] and you're supposed to hang with people
[24:12] but maybe i'm right at that point to
[24:14] where i'm maybe i should i know dad's
[24:16] got a lot more grace than i do
[24:18] with uh with the people but
[24:20] but live the life first
[24:23] if that apple tree
[24:25] i can go outside today and i got five
[24:27] trees planted down in the yard
[24:30] and i know whatever one of them produced
[24:32] why
[24:33] because in the spring when they
[24:36] blossom
[24:37] they look the pear tree looks just like
[24:39] the apple tree
[24:41] but give it about another month
[24:44] it will start the apple tree will not
[24:46] have pears on it
[24:48] my three apple trees by their fruit i
[24:51] know that they're an apple tree because
[24:53] an apple starts growing on the end of
[24:56] that vine
[24:57] and then my other two pear trees i know
[24:59] they're pear trees because pears start
[25:01] growing on the other on the end of their
[25:02] vine why by the fruits you should be
[25:04] known
[25:07] and that's the same over the seals
[25:10] we got to get the life right first get
[25:12] justified get sanctified get full the
[25:14] holy ghost get into the word because
[25:16] that's the first four
[25:18] that gets you into glory
[25:20] but that's not the requirement of this
[25:22] age right that got people into glory
[25:24] from from the first church age to the
[25:26] seventh church age
[25:28] without knowing a thing about the seal
[25:30] without knowing a thing about a lot of
[25:32] things a lot of them went in being
[25:34] baptized in the name of father son holy
[25:35] ghost
[25:36] because that's all they knew
[25:39] but god winked at that and said hey this
[25:41] is a sincere heart i know
[25:44] because see he couldn't go over the book
[25:46] of joel
[25:48] joel saw the vision
[25:50] of that tree being eaten down
[25:52] right read restoration of the bribery
[25:54] sometimes really good book to read
[25:56] and then he saw the restoration of that
[25:58] tree
[26:00] so so jesus couldn't come and preach
[26:02] anything different than what he saw
[26:04] in joel because he's when he wrote what
[26:06] was in john
[26:08] through joel he was one that wrote it so
[26:09] he couldn't say anything different he
[26:10] said you must be born again
[26:13] actually it's born again b-o-r-n is not
[26:15] born you're born again
[26:17] because what you bear something that
[26:20] means it's born
[26:21] from you he said you must be born from
[26:22] above
[26:24] millions of people were born the other
[26:26] way billions of people have been born
[26:27] the other way
[26:28] you understand about this other day
[26:31] a couple days ago
[26:33] seven billion people in this world
[26:37] and there was probably 100 of us here
[26:40] i couldn't figure the percentage what
[26:42] percentage of that is
[26:44] of what's out there in this world
[26:47] doing the things of the world
[26:49] even being just living good lives and
[26:51] then coming closer and living a good um
[26:54] what we call a
[26:55] nominal christian life and then coming
[26:57] down to us how little of a group
[27:01] compared to the billions of people in
[27:03] this world
[27:04] that will never hear the word jesus
[27:06] christ
[27:07] never hear the of the revelation that we
[27:09] have
[27:11] kind of makes you humble doesn't it
[27:14] if you got a little part of it hold on
[27:15] to it that's right
[27:17] hold on to it you got just a little
[27:19] spark
[27:20] hold on to that spark but see if you
[27:22] don't get the spark first there can't be
[27:24] a fire that's right
[27:26] you can't build a fire without spark
[27:28] you got to have a spark first i don't
[27:30] care if you got this great big blower
[27:31] this big there's something there goes
[27:33] what
[27:34] and when it does what happens one little
[27:36] spark shoots out and if you got 25 000
[27:40] btus behind it all of a sudden you got
[27:42] that flowing out of that chamber just
[27:44] from one little
[27:45] spark
[27:46] so get the spark
[27:48] that's why i said about those kids back
[27:50] there i don't want them just in church i
[27:51] don't want to fill a few we'll have to
[27:52] build a new church well then 80 people
[27:54] come back
[27:57] but i want i want us to be functional
[28:00] christians right i'm gonna be speaking
[28:02] on that some functional christians not
[28:04] just christians functional christians
[28:07] god speaks of us as being his body right
[28:10] sometimes i believe some of his bodies a
[28:12] little on the dead side
[28:14] paralyzed maybe not dead but paralyzed
[28:18] you know
[28:20] it would be good to get maybe just a
[28:22] hallelujah
[28:24] every once in a while
[28:26] you know praise the lord
[28:29] move a little
[28:31] we don't have to be fanatical but you
[28:32] know what
[28:33] god's body is a moving body remember
[28:35] brother brown said when man stood still
[28:38] god kept moving right
[28:41] because man would would be in the work
[28:43] of god in the in the in the baptist and
[28:45] the presbyterian and all that god had to
[28:47] work in all those but what happened when
[28:49] they
[28:50] stopped
[28:52] he just moved on off and kept on going
[28:53] because god's a moving god we'll read it
[28:55] in ezekiel those four combat beasts
[28:58] never stop
[28:59] they're always moving
[29:01] always moving always going all those
[29:03] those angels
[29:04] in heaven they're not sitting on on
[29:06] their seats going
[29:09] no they're praising god and just moving
[29:11] all over the place and then we got them
[29:13] all down here with us to help us
[29:16] so you got movement god's in move god
[29:18] you know god's in movement he's not in
[29:20] he's not in dead letter this is a living
[29:23] word this word is alive why
[29:25] all this was about people
[29:27] and why do we come up to the end time
[29:29] and think we're anything different
[29:31] we are a special group of people but
[29:33] we're not different in that we got to do
[29:35] something
[29:36] extraordinary no let's just start doing
[29:38] what the bible says first
[29:41] get the holy ghost get the baptism of
[29:43] the holy ghost then you birth start
[29:45] becoming a functional christian
[29:48] somebody read your bible and pray
[29:50] do things right in life
[29:53] don't say oops so much
[29:56] we gotta quit you know i was telling i
[29:57] told him at brother doug scott's and i i
[29:59] believe in a hundred percent
[30:01] you know the quota brother realm says
[30:02] we're living below our privileges
[30:05] that's been 45 years ago he made that
[30:08] quote
[30:09] we're still quoting it
[30:12] quotes will kill you
[30:15] we have no excuse bro bob
[30:17] why do we keep saying we will we living
[30:20] below a privilege
[30:21] no one day we gotta come up to that
[30:23] privilege
[30:25] and start living that privilege
[30:28] you hear preachers i do too and i say it
[30:30] sometimes myself we are living below our
[30:31] privileges but one day we gotta meet
[30:33] that privilege somewhere
[30:35] if we keep living below our privileges
[30:37] we're going to let this thing right here
[30:38] take a hold of us
[30:40] and it's not spiritual death if you're
[30:42] born again
[30:43] but it's natural death
[30:45] looking at every one of us i got older
[30:48] rebecca's got older older
[30:52] joyce got older who else had a birthday
[30:54] in january
[30:59] mr kathy much older
[31:04] and you know every birthday coming up we
[31:06] get one year older so thank god thank
[31:09] the lord and that's the good option
[31:13] you know somebody said something to me
[31:14] the other day about that i said well the
[31:15] other option let's talk to a believer
[31:18] somebody over in dutch's church i guess
[31:19] it was
[31:20] talking about birthdays and they and i
[31:22] said well you know the other options not
[31:23] that good you know before being you know
[31:25] being dead and they look to me and said
[31:27] well no that'd be good for us to get out
[31:29] of here and i thought for a second and i
[31:31] said no
[31:33] you're looking at it wrong
[31:35] the bible says there's going to be a
[31:36] group here that says we which are alive
[31:38] and remain
[31:40] i'm not going to confess that i'm just
[31:41] going to take that other option
[31:45] i still have birthdays for god changes
[31:47] me that's right abraham just continued
[31:49] having birthdays till he got changed
[31:51] he wasn't looking at death when it come
[31:52] to that you know i'm sure he died
[31:54] naturally but we're not going to do that
[31:55] that's not promise to us
[31:57] so the other option is not the greatest
[32:00] option if you think you're going to be
[32:01] here for the change because if you're
[32:03] dead
[32:04] you ain't gonna be here for the live and
[32:05] remain i'll promise you that
[32:08] but on this four seal let's put
[32:09] everything everything's gotta come
[32:10] together everything that we talked about
[32:12] everything that we have looked into
[32:14] white because if you take white red and
[32:16] black put it in a paint can and swirl it
[32:18] around
[32:19] you're going to get do it sometime
[32:21] just take food coloring and swirl it
[32:23] around you're going to get the palest
[32:25] awfulest
[32:27] dullest
[32:29] kind of a gray like you see these
[32:31] zombies that they have on tv and all
[32:33] that stuff you see this dead look
[32:35] well that's what it is if you still got
[32:37] all three of them working in your life
[32:40] you're gonna be a pretty pale horse
[32:43] you know i like puzzles i don't get to
[32:44] do them but i do like puzzles when i
[32:46] collect them and there's one
[32:49] that i noticed in a book i'm debating
[32:50] about it's the apocalypse
[32:52] and the way they drew it is a pure white
[32:54] horse and they're really running like a
[32:56] gallop
[32:57] a pure white horse and then a red horse
[33:00] and a true black
[33:02] and then this gray it looks like a an
[33:05] appaloosa is that what they're called
[33:06] yeah it's a gray horse like an apple
[33:08] gray it's pretty but
[33:10] when you know what it means yeah
[33:12] yeah well hey all this is pretty to the
[33:15] world he's got them food they're in the
[33:18] beauty of the world but that pale horse
[33:20] means death to us we know that's what i
[33:22] mean you know
[33:23] even looking at the picture because
[33:24] brother brown said hey
[33:26] john looked at that church and had my
[33:28] and admired her as a beautiful church
[33:32] but she was dead hiding behind all that
[33:35] so read some more on the fourth seal
[33:37] read your book read the fourth seal that
[33:38] brother brown talks about we'll make a
[33:40] few comments next sunday
[33:41] lord bless you
[33:43] thank you
