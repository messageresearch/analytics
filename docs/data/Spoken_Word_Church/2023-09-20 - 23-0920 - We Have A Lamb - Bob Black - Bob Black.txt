atonement tonight Lord Jesus we just claim your blood Lord Jesus and lay all of your promises Lord At Your Feet that will remind you of the things that you've said unto us Lord we ask the Lord to just move upon the scene for them there they're in the hospital Lord and find them a room Lord and just lay the path out clear Lord just everything will work out exactly the way you should Lord Jesus you'll be with them Lord and give them a special blessing give us a special blessing here tonight Lord Jesus as we look into your word Lord Jesus said as we study these things out with God as we lord as we speak these things Lord God surely Lord we lord we would we would be lacking something without you to move Among Us Lord Jesus without your spirit to Quicken these words to us Lord Jesus and we just ask the Lord God that you'll just bless it now to us Lord and this little place Lord Jesus we we're reminded of your promises Lord but you said where the twos and the threes are gathered together in your name that you would be there in our midst so Lord surely we know that tonight Lord you're in our midst as we look into your word Lord Jesus we have confidence Lord Jesus with all the promises that you gave to us we have confidence in what you did first Lord Jesus and we have confidence in what you're doing now Lord by the by the power of the holy ghost moving in our lives and moving in our midst Lord Jesus we just ask your blessing upon these things now in your name amen now I was I was kind of thinking what to what to talk about tonight maybe this maybe this will be just a little a little brief lesson and but I was I was thinking about um I certainly enjoyed brother Andrew's message on Sunday and and I maybe just really want to continue that thought I think there's a short all right okay okay sounds good that'll do it thank you so uh just want to continue uh what brother maybe uh the kind of thought that brother brother Andrew was bringing out on Sunday Sunday morning and just speak to you this morning at the topic we have a lamb and read from Revelation chapter five uh now tonight aren't you glad that we've got a lamb yeah uh we've got a lamb that that died for us that that paid the price for us when we weren't worthy when we couldn't do it we've got a lamb that we can look to that's right so in Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 it says and I saw on the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open up the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth and neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders saith unto me wheat not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the woman of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof he may be seated the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word now you really you think about what a Sublime scripture that is that there's nobody worthy to open up the book oh you think about really what that means now when you think about it now that if that if if you can read the Bible and understand it and if you can read and understand as we're supposed to be able to do in this day the Seven Seals and understand all these deep Mysteries then that proves that something spiritual has happened it's something supernatural has happened and maybe we'll just take our time this morning and just talk to you Revelation as we were studying these things out the last few times that I preached from revelation of chapter four in Revelation chapter two and three uh John John saw uh he's looking at all the the church ages laid out and then in Revelation chapter four he got he hears that voice calling them up and he sees the that that uh that scene laid out in front of him one sat on the throne one sitting on the throne and he's seeing a a a of the vision of one sitting there on the throne and then in Revelation chapter five you see the lamb come forth from the throne and and take that book and and and here we're reading this uh as we read these scriptures it's talking about it's asking the question the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy who is worthy to open up the book and brother Brown will say now you speak about unworthiness that there's not anybody on Earth that's worthy to open up that book and even or even look at it not even worthy to look at it now he said you speak about unworthiness not even worthy to look at it no man nowhere no man nowhere that you could find anywhere that's worthy to look at that book so if if you want to understand it some something's got to happen right something's got to happen something's got to take place for you to be able to look at these things for you because somebody's going to be able to understand it right somebody's going to be able to understand these things and brother Ann will say if there's no one that is worthy how can we ever hope to see what is written in this book now you see what a Sublime thing this is that's laid out for us that John was concerned you know you look across the land today and it seems like there's not really that many people that are concerned anymore I think John could we could learn a lot from John that he was he was really concerned oh he began to look and see that there was no man worthy to open up that book and he began to grieve and began to cry and begin to weep that no man was open worthy to open up that book and you think you know brother Branham and even brother Dale when he preached the seals and things it would kind of belabor the point that what John had to walk with Jesus John had been there on the day of Pentecost he knew he was born again why would he weep like that now you think about that all these things that are laying there in the scripture that that John knew that there was something special tied in tied in with the opening of the seals that they had to be open now think think this morning think why the seals have to be open we've got all these we've got all these uh loved ones that have gone on can you all hear me okay all right no just I see some weird looks I just want to make sure you can you can understand [Laughter] what was I saying we've got many loved ones and things that have have passed on and going beyond the grave and and if something doesn't happen then if oh you look around the world and you see all the uh the garbage heaps that are piled up and all the uh the trash that's going into the ocean and the filth is uh all all in all the cities all around if something doesn't happen then there's got to be something happen to clean off the Earth there's got to be something to happen to bring the dead Saints from the ground there's got to be something happening in in the lives of you and I to give us confidence that we are going to go in the rapture give us confidence to give us a place where we can really stand and tell the devil boo to know that the devil is nothing but a bluff to see the end of iniquity and all these things to really see the path that God has taken us on to bring us to a place where where these things can be opened to us and we can have an understanding now brother Brandon would say and he's he'd say in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he say you know envisions you cannot reveal things until you are permitted to reveal them now now let's just let's just meditate on that now there Comes A Time there comes an old all down through the history people have probe and really wanted to see these things but it just wasn't time yet but then there Comes A Time a time after after oh you think maybe uh like the church has been moving like the when Ezekiel Saw the four cherubims with the wheel in the middle of the wheel rolling and that brother brother Adam said that was them traveling traveling on a journey but there Comes A Time at the end of the journey when the thing the thing that's in the boxcar can be revealed what's really in the boxcar what's been sealed in there after the travel after the journey and see what brother round is saying here he said the breach between the seven churches and Seven Seals he said you know in Visions you cannot reveal things until you are permitted to reveal them how many times have you all heard me say go into a house perhaps a hat be laid here and this certain child or so forth will not be healed until that is laid over here I cannot tell them or neither can I move it there it's got to be moved in some other way somebody else has to take it and move it and everything in order then it can be revealed I see everything's got to be in order that's why you know sometimes it perplexes us in our mind when we see what we know that our mature Christians that have come to a place and yet there looks like they're going down in their body and and maybe maybe the Lord will take them off to say oh wait think about brother Branham we know he we know he came to adoption that's what we believe and and they were standing there at his grave watching him be lowered his casket lowered in the ground and you wonder well how could this be a man that came to maturity adoption well come on now let's catch it we've all got to come all of the Bride got to come to that place of maturity adoption we've all got to come to that place oh and then we all come to that place then something's going to happen so let's don't get discouraged whenever you look around and you know I was thinking about brother Perry green uh telling about uh how discouraged it seemed like everybody was when they were watching brother Branham it looked like everything was over think about the disciples when it looked like everything was over when when they lowered put Jesus in that grave and rolled the tomb over it oh but that wasn't the end of the story that wasn't the end of the story why why do I know that it's not the end of the story because we got a lamp we got a lamb they can open up the book and it's not based on our worthiness it's not our worthiness that we're standing here that we're coming to church tonight but it's his worthiness he is the one that has made us Worthy now you you see there's somebody he said somebody else has to take it into a little hat and move it and everything in order then it can be revealed like that time that brother Branham was in that uh that little sister's house that he went to pray for early on in his ministry and he he he he goofed up and and and he had to wait for that hat to be placed exactly where it needed to be and see how that's what he's trying to get us everything's got to be in order so let's rate wait like Paul said we're running a race we're running a race let's be patient and wait for things to fall in order I think where we're waiting on we're waiting not waiting on Jesus Christ but we're waiting on one another for us to fall in order for all of the different ones all around the world to fall in place to to get right in position with the world to be in subjection with the word where God has just totally claimed our lives and there's a time there's a time when the thing can be revealed but we got to wait and be patient and keep moving right but when the time comes when the time comes it's time for the revealing now that's why all you think now this is really an encouraging thing to say that's why we come to church because we're wanting Revelation that's why we come to church that's why we through life we put up with things that's why we we deal with things we deal with one another we deal with fake people at work and different things we're we're there's a goal in front of us that we're trying to achieve that's why we press on that's why we don't back down or turn around that's why we keep moving forward like Paul encouraged Us in the book of Hebrews you keep moving forward toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and don't give up and don't back down and let's be zealous like John was when he began to see you there's somebody's how could somebody's got to be able to open up this book I need somebody that's worthy I think maybe tonight that's what our hearts should be crying out for I I need a lamb and if you need a lamb you've come to the right place because this is where we talk about a lamb we talk about the lamb that was shed for us once for all and there's a promise laying in the Bible that the time will come for the lamb to take the book the time will come for that lamb to take the book now you see we're not waiting now we're not waiting for a date on the calendar as the years go roll by and the months Roll by it seems like the older you get the faster the years Roll by it seems like it just gets faster and faster doesn't it we're already at the end of this year but we're not waiting for a date on the calendar we're waiting what are we waiting on he said we're not waiting on Jesus where God is waiting on us we're waiting on growth maturity so that's what I'm talking about tonight when when these things are opened up to you it is a sign that something is taking place in the church it's something that's taken place in the bride something takes it's supernatural has taken place in your character in your life now that's what I'm talking about tonight that God you come to a place where God is confident with your character that he's confident with what he sees in you that you've been inspected like that boxcar that's got to be inspected it's got to be inspected before it can be sealed up your character your Revelation grows and grows precept upon precept line up online here a little there a little until God has confidence in you oh think this this afternoon we're not here this afternoon just to for personalities to to see one another we're not here in this building for for religious order to see stained glass windows or something we're not here for Comfort or for wealth we're not here for plus season tailored worship and coffee coffee pots and big names and buildings but what we've gathered here this afternoon for is for revelation that is the most important thing in the life of any Christian any born-again Christian that's really that's really you oh you come to a place where that's all you want is a revelation oh that was what John wanted when he saw that there was no man worthy to open up that book that's what he wanted he wanted to look at that book he wanted to see what that book said because that book had something to say about his Redemption it had something to say about himself and I tell you what it had to say it had something to say about his Lord and Savior the only one that can open up that book was the one that wrote it oh you see if you can read that book that shows that something has happened to you that you've got a relationship with the one that wrote it and the only one that corroded has revealed it to you and the revelation of Jesus Christ he said brother and said oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I am not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and he said and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit now that should encourage us all tonight to know that maybe if we're in a place where we don't see things clearly if we don't see that like we're looking through a lattice like Solomon talked and we and it's like we things aren't quiet in perspective yet that there's a promise here that God wants to reveal his word to us now now you go back and you listen to how brother brother Dale used to preach these things and he would compare he would compare your adoption time when when you were first seeking the new birth you didn't come haphazard and say well I'm just going to it's got to be my way or the highway but you come groaning and grieving and on your knees and standing praying at night and pacing back and forth and listening to this preacher and listening to that preacher and you didn't just come haphazard but you were after something and you're not going to come to a place of adoption on just some kind of haphazard it's going to be something within you crawling and it's something our children something won't God more of God is something where you you've got to have more of God like John looking at this place I need it I need God you you think you're going to come to a place of adoption just kind of haphazard going into church and sitting there and just falling asleep all the time and that will produce nothing but you've got to come sincerely sincerely wanted something from God and expecting that God will reward you oh it's the hour for that my freaking it's the hour where God wants to see it sincere zealous Hearts somebody that's labor and crying in the middle of the hour somebody that knows that God is able to reveal it and brother Adam said this seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10. he said in Isaiah chapter 40 he said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength for they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint who those that wait upon the Lord because this seven sealer book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10. so the church has been waiting for that time now I believe I believe the time is here just generally for the bride but I believe that time is for here for for you specifically those of you that have been labored in the message for years and decades oh surely surely the word is continue to be opened up to you the word has been building and building and you see oh you see God has put a place a promise in the word where maybe you've wondered for years and years if exactly where you are in the scripture but there's a promise here in the Bible that when these things open up to you oh that'll that will give you confidence you see that's that's why we're pressing on toward the seven seal the Seven Seals must be open to the bride in this day because that will give you confidence that you know where you stand with God that you know that you have been born again and something that's taken place in your life and you know that oh I'll say I'll Echo the words of brother Dale from years ago when when the Seven Seals are really open to you you will know that you are not going to die that's why the seals must be open to you and we're speaking this afternoon about a book that is promised to be opened it is promised to be open We've Got This Promise laying here that this book can be open and we'll be open to the bride in the in the in the end times it was open in Revelation 10. in Revelation 10 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet his pillars of Fire and he had in his little hand in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the Earth now here in one place in Revelation 5 it was closed here and sealed but here in Revelation 10 it's open it's been opened and he said since that time of the ceiling we're getting into tonight now the book's open now really what we're talking about tonight how did it open If no man was Worthy how did it open If no man was worthy because you got it before you can look at it before you can understand it you got to understand how did it open how is it going to open up to you how did it open brother Adam said well if we read in Revelation 2 chapter 10 if we just keep reading I'm just going to read some scripture here and just walk through the scripture he had in his hand the little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not now he brother Brown would say now that's what we don't know that's yet to be revealed it's not in holy script what them Thunders say when he was preaching it he said we don't know what he preached the preach sermon and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up His Hands to Heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the heavens and the things that therein are and the earth and the things therein are and there should be time no longer watch here's a verse I want to get to brother Adam said within the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he gets declared to his servants the prophet now it says when he shall begin to sound now brother Brown preached we believe that he is the seventh angel that he's talking about he preached and he preached and he preached but the seven of the seals will not open up at the beginning of his ministry they were opened up at the end when he began to preach and to fulfill what God has commissioned Malachi 456 that his message would turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers when he should begin to sound now when he shall begin to sound means when his ministry his message begin to sound not when he started to preach but when his message began to sound the mystery of the seven seal book will be revealed of the sounding of the seven Church Angels message not the brother around would say not the years in preparation not them those years back in the beginning when he was he didn't really understand things not when he was just a little baby we'll say not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message when he begins to sound the message what didn't occur at the beginning of his life but at the end there at the beginning of that last three and a half years when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries then will be revealed the seventh angel begins to sound and there's the messages wrote out there and we got it and tape and book form now if the message if the Seven Seals were revealed there at the end of his life at the culmination of his life the crowning of his life what about the crowning of your life not the end of your life like that right before you go down in the grave or something like that every problem you go back through every promise in the Bible right there after Abraham walked with God for 25 years and hung on and there there at the end something happened he he met Melchizedek and and Melchizedek lingered with him and began to open up these things and showed him all these promises oh you follow every promise in the Bibles there oh David David was anointed by Samuel there at the beginning but there at the end he went through three anointings he was anointed by the tribe of Judah and there anointed by all of Israel there at the end something happened there at the end something happens there at the end what what end are you talking about I'm talking about your adoption adoption time when you grow and grow and there at the end God opens up something special to you not at the beginning of his ministry was it opened up but at the conclusion oh what was open up to him The Complete Book of redemption what was up so that you so that he could preach it to you and I and you and I could see what he saw what is this book of redemption that we're talking about tonight brother I'm going to say Jesus Christ the son of God is the book of redemption he was the word and he is the word and that's bound to be him you see so this is the whole book of redemption which is Jesus Christ fitly put together by God with the promises of redemption and healing and everything for the human being that's why Revelation is the most important thing to a Christian because Revelation reveals Jesus Christ it's all about Jesus Christ when you read the Bible you see more of Jesus Christ that's the evidence of the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ when you as you walk you see more and more of him and that gives you confidence as you as the word is revealed to you it transforms your life it changes your character and as the word is revealed to you and it opens up to you it's actually claiming your life as the word is revealed it's opening up more and more to you of who Jesus Christ is that's what brother Brown said the new birth he said what is the new birth then you'd say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see not you joined a church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built on oh where is this in the Bible brother Bob in Hebrews 11 1. it says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen I I think this afternoon maybe if that confuses you a little bit we can take Faith and swap it for revelation we could take Revelation and swap it for faith faith is a revelation Revelation is Faith and those two things are really the same thing so if you've got faith is because God has revealed something to you and what did he reveal to you he revealed himself to you when you need healing he reveals that he is a Healer and that you've got the thing that you were hoping for and now you've got it because it's revealed to you you and that becomes a substance it is a substance because it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you you see him when you read the Bible is transformed be caught Beyond just something that's in your hand some head knowledge and now it's in your heart and you know it because he's shown it to you that's what I'm talking about when I'm preaching about the Seven Seals when God reveals it to you you've got it it's something that passes beyond all hopes oh that's you say well brother Bob what is the difference between Hope and Faith Faith is not something you're just looking for faith is when God reveals it to you and you've got the thing that you were hoping for because God has revealed it to you that's what Jesus said in John chapter 5 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has the everlasting life he that believeth he that understandeth when God reveals it to you and you understand because God is personally shown it to you the author of The Bible has revealed it to you and shown a big old flashlight on it then you you know that it's true then oh that's the evidence that you have passed from Death unto eternal life so that's why Romans chapter 10 says faith cometh by hearing now listen to the way this is worded Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that you can sit there in church every day of your life and hear the the word will be preached but unless you hear it it will never bring Faith so the question is do you hear what the spirit is saying to the churches you'll never be able to hear without that lamb that I'm talking about you'll never be able to hear without an atonement applied to your life where you have accepted what Jesus Christ did for you and accepted it and believed it and had it applied to your life like they did there in Egypt where they applied the blood over the little of their door and they believed what God had done Faith cometh by hearing can you hear can you hear oh when you when you hear the preaching of the Gospel does it excite you or does it bore you when you hear the preaching of the word do you really can you hear between the letter between the lines do you hear God actually speaking to you and opening it up to you do you hear what the spirit is saying to you can you hear because if you can hear oh if you can read the Bible in a different way read it by the lens of the Holy Ghost then you read different than the whole rest of the world can read because you've got an ear you've got an eyesight you've got that the veil has been pulled away from your eyes where you can read you're reading it different Revelation chapter 3 the promise to the laodicean church he that hath in the ear let him hear what the spirits saith unto the churches promise to all the church ages he that hath an ear because if you can hear if you can hear that will produce faith this book will be understood at the end brother remember said this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery who winds up all of the Loose Ends that these fellows probe that and the Mysteries comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God oh look at this pattern at the end at the end when every mystery is finished when every mystery is finished in the church Ages Every loose end is tied up when every mystery is tied up in your life when all the loose ends are tied up all the things that you wondered about is it a trinity is is there such a thing as eternal hell how do we be how do we how should we be baptized when all these things are tied up all the Loose Ends the book of redemption will be understood I'm talking about understanding tonight because an eagle will understand oh you realize that promise you you got to be like that eagle that looked down at that little squirrel just to chatter in a way the days of Miracles are passed the days of Miracles are passed like brother Ram said and what does an eagle do what's an eagle's response to that I don't care I don't care what you say and the ego oh you can you go through all the life of all the the bullies and all the picking and all the different things people saying well you're prideful people saying this and that people making fun people saying well I don't think you got the Holy Ghost I don't think you really believe the truth I don't think that you really have to dress the way that you dress I don't think that this and that and all those things oh but God's bringing us to a place of perfect rest and peace in him why where does it come from from Revelation revelation brother Adam said we see that this seven sealed book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God he said the Seven Seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those Seven Seals has sealed in we're only presuming them things we are sure to miss the thing unless unless it is absolutely genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit and Vindicated the same so what we can understand is that we need we need God to understand these things there's no way to understand without God there's no way to understand but if you do understand that see that's the that's the thing God wants us to understand and when the book is opened then you can have confidence that something supernatural has happened we need a lamb the book is completely sealed up brother Andrew said the book is absolutely sealed do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book until the Seven Seals is broken it is sealed up with Seven Seals what's sealed up what is it all about what is this book about well that's sealed up how does the book open that's sealed up what is redeemed what is the thing that's redeemed is sealed up how is it redeemed it's sealed up what takes place it's sealed up who did the Redeemer how did it work how how did all these things fit together it's all sealed up he said it was closed here in Revelation is the fifth chapter and in Revelation is the 10th chapter it is open and brother Brown said in the message to breach he said now we're going to see what the book says about how it become open now surely that tonight that Peaks our attention wouldn't we like to know how the book became open he said it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book see the Lambs got to take the book it's he is the Lambs got to take the book if it's his book and he's the one that wrote it and is sealed up and no man is worthy he's the only one that can take the book The Lambs got to take the book that's why we need to lay them the lamb is the only one that's worthy that's why we got to have a lamb we need the lamb brother I'm going to say we're depending on him and we will see later it is at the end time when time has run out no denomination has a right for the interpretation of the book no man has a right to interpret it that's why when we stand up behind this platform this Podium we don't come with our own ideas we're coming straight to preach the word not our own ideas and our opinions our our politics and some grievance that we have some petty grievance against somebody in the church or some idea that we have but we're coming to preach the word of God that because why would come for Revelation you know that's what draws people to church is revelation that's why we've come here is revelation it is the Lamb who interprets it and the lamb is the one who speaks it and the lamb makes the word to be known by vindicating and bringing the word to life but in the last stage all these Mysteries are to be solved and handed out now that's a pretty big promise that all the Mysteries are to be solved and handed out and the seals are to be opened by the lamb and revealed to the church and then time is no more what what is a seal anyway a seal when you seal up a letter it shows where it came from a seal shows ownership a shield oh oh when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost it shows that you are gods ownership that in Ephesians chapter 1 it says and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise and that proves that God has done something in your life he's cut off all your sins he's he's he's forgiven you of all your sins he's cleaned you up and he's sealed you in he sealed your soul to show that your soul the Redemption process of your soul is finished it's done and it shows that he's claimed you your soul is his which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession it's the it's the down payment until everything is accomplished in your life until the Redemption of the whole purchased possession until the praise unto the praise of his glory the holy spirit is a seal and to that individual when he receives the Holy Spirit and his time of groaning is over see because it is the finished work no more groaning when you're sealed oh there's a lot of groaning and crying when you're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost but when you're sealed when God seals you in through the baptism of the Holy Ghost all that groaning and striving is done and now you're resting in him you're resting like Ruth did when she was resting Boaz got up and Ruth laid down Boaz got up and went to work and you're just resting and and you're resting in what he did you're resting in the fact that he's the only one that's worthy and you don't have to do anything you're resting like a boxcar that gets sealed up it's still it's inspected it's packed in it's sealed up and it's sealed up to its destination now at the end at the destination they look and see what's on the inside the inspector shuts the door and the inspector places a seal upon it and then nobody can break that seal that boxcar seal until it reaches its destination and brother Brown said that's what the holy spirit's been doing see he goes and he inspects that's the reason you can't have these things and you say I spoke in tongues and I shouted and I danced in the spirit that don't have nothing to do with it see the Holy Spirit inspects that person until he's thoroughly satisfied I knows that they are then they are sealed until their Eternal destination there's not nothing can ever break that seal so what's that seal he's talking about the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit seals you and he says when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of God that sealed in these mysterious seals is finished until the day that seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it if the man's wondering now listen if the man's wondering what's in that boxcar you say it's supposed to be such and such is supposed to be a real born-again believer that's what it's supposed to be but if you're just presuming he says presuming but when the seal is broken and the door is open we see into it then and see exactly what's in there and that'll only be done at the end time well what a great thing to know what's in that boxcar oh you see why the seals had to be opened up the seals will give you Rapture and Faith the seals have to be opened up to you to the bride for the dead in Christ to rise from the ground oh that's why oh in this hour we are predestinated we are called to preach the Deep things of God it's it's great to go into a camp meeting and and preach you know just kind of nice a good come to Jesus meeting where where people come to the Lord and give their hearts to the Lord but there's going to come a time where the church doors were closed and there won't be any more coming in but the bride will be preaching then to the totally lost and will be coming to a place oh we'll we'll I believe surely by then we'll we'll know where we stand with Christ we'll know this book is sealed and you are sealed with a book until the day of redemption and something that's what we're groaning for that's something in US is groaning and crying for that full Redemption oh brother Ram said I'm gonna uh well I guess we kind of got time in Romans chapter eight he said for we uh Paul said in Romans chapter 8 for we know that the whole creation groanth and travaileth and pain together until now like now like did you notice that was brother Andrew was preaching on Sunday well you're groaning and when a child you're grown something's being delivered now when your deliverance comes then you're happy you can now you can rest you can hold the baby the baby's there but before that your groanings you're grown and what are we travailing for we're travailing to see Christ fully made manifest in us before you're born again and sanctification you're groaning and travailing to see Christ manifested you want to be him see him born in you and now as we grow in Grace and knowledge up that stature of perfect man we're groaning and travailing again going through a higher form of sanctification something is growing in us as the word is being manifested in US pushing out nature but around and said nature is groaning we are groaning everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right oh oh surely we can we can see that we're not right yet there's something not right and the only way oh now listen to this the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been New Life coming here that speaks of a new world foreign oh that proves that something supernatural has taken place in you when you are zealous for the word when you want that word oh I remember when I first come to the Lord I'd sit in church meetings and I'd get a headache and the devil would attack me I wanted it was so bad I would sit there and I'm not saying this to be both for myself it's a fact I wanted it I wanted the word and that's how any born-again believer should be you want the word and that's how any preacher should be too you want to preach the word not to stay down in like little pity Patty things but to grow up where you can preach the real that's what I want to do I want to preach some real meat because Eagles want real meat that's what the eagle wants they want some real meat and the meat that I'm talking about is it's adoption time meat me meet what we come and we begin to realize where we are positionally placed where we can realize that the devil don't have any weapons that he's a bluff well we can see the end of our iniquity that we're talking about well we can see with that sword in the hand of that second ride it really symbolizes well we can see what these four beasts really symbolizes now that's the meat that'll give a real bride confidence in where she stands in the hour that she's living here now brother Brown would say you don't groan unless there's a reason for it there's a reason for our grown and he said did you ever notice how a tree struggles for life it wants to live and you notice an animal how and death how it's struggles you notice a human being everything nature is growing we and ourselves are groaning we know that there's something wrong we see from these verses that something has been lost both the man and Earth creation of all time because we're gonna this Earth is going to be redeemed so that we can come and live on it but before this whole earth holy redeemed our Earth is going to be redeemed and that is the mystery that's laying there in that seven seal book he said we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life I know it's Wednesday night so y'all just listen with your eyes closed it's fine I I don't I really I don't mind just just as long as you listen just listen close your eyes and relax and just listen that's fine a tree he said a tree never died before Adam an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God but when we die to sin we sold out our Birthright and crossed this Chasm now we're beyond the reach of God on this other side of the chasm Adam had completely Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the Earth he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to see but when he did that when he just took what what the serpent told Eve and listened to his wife when he did that he lost his inheritance now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God now that's that scene that John is looking at in Revelation 4 One sat on the throne the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to which the original owner God himself so God himself has the title deed to your Redemptive rights every Redemptive right that you can have the promise of to be to be what is to be the god of the earth a god a god of the earth like Adam they could speak and the winds would be still to speak in a mountain be moved that's why these promises are laying here in the scripture that if you say to a mountain and don't doubt in your heart why because that is what you were predestinated for from back in the back part of God's mind that's the kind of person that God wanted you to be a faith-filled person that when you speak to a mountain that it obeys you when you speak to the winds and the waves that it obeys you that you could speak by faith and believe that God would stop the rain from falling and it would obey you that you could lay your hands on your wife in the dead of night and pray for her and the sickness would leave that something would happen when you pray because of faith and what is Faith a revelation because God has revealed to you for some aspect of himself brother Ram said there he sits on the throne with it in his hand he sets on the throne with it the title deed he said oh that makes me feel religious friends now you when these things really sink down into your heart that will make that's what will make a Believer cry in the car and Shout in the shower and praise God whether going on a walk in the morning is when God begins to reveal himself to you and open up to you the things that are just laying here on the page oh that's why we need the spirit because the spirit is what gives the essence of the word did you realize even as I'm speaking to you the spirit in which it's conveyed gives it the meaning the spirit is what gives it the essence of the meaning and when God's spirit quickens to you it's revealed to you by the way I said what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we're getting to now he said we'll watch this fella sitting on the throne what is this book of redemption it's this abstract title deed an abstract shows the lean history ownership history all the problems with being able to claim it all the encompasses and what else it said an abstract deed shows us it shows the details of it I I thank God when God reveals to you his word it shows all the details of what you've got access to it shows every detail laid out there how it works how it happens and brother Adam said it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost that's what is in this seven seal book that everything that they lost is given back to you all that that should make that should make anybody want to shout right right that everything they lost is given back to you when you can see it when you can understand he said that possession of that deed Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he needed Redemption himself so he could not do it now we're getting we're getting to the close how does the book come open ah he couldn't do it but the law required a Kinsmen Redeemer what's a Kinsmen Redeemer somebody to buy back everything that was lost a kinsman redeemer to bring you back to your possession to make you holy to cover you like Boaz did oh all of Ruth's all the history all her past when when Boaz threw that covering over her it covered all of that to cause you to rest to cease from your labor so that's why we need lamb tonight that's what I'm preaching about that's why we need a lamb we need a lamb and when you've got a lamb then the lamb makes you Worthy the lamb makes you worthy to read the book the man not your own worthiness not your own righteousness but it's what he did he's the one that paid the price for you he's the one that give you the Holy Ghost now come on now when he give you the Holy Ghost it wasn't just for to just to play around with but he gave it to you for a purpose to understand these words to understand him to have a relationship with him to know him oh we've got somebody that paid the price for us we've got somebody that covered us that paid it offer us to change us that's why brother Rand preached those messages about being changed that this word the the revelation of Jesus Christ will have an effect in your life it will change you and make you different and sanctify you and he said man was without a way back and there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer and the person of Jesus Christ law required it and Grace Grace met its requirements God's law required an innocent substitute but who was innocent everybody on Earth was born of a woman there's only one man well Adam was born without sexual desire but then he went away from God's word and caused all of the mess that we're in but there was only one man Jesus Christ that was born like he was virgin born and that's what brother Rams said every man had been born sexual after sex everyone and the only one that wasn't had forfeited the rice now now you think well just go for just a few more minutes every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals The Mystery of the whole book is in themselves that's why when the mystery is open you can trace every mystery all the way through the Bible That's why when you find out that you need a lamb you find out Abel needed a lamb too and when when Cain saw that his sacrifice was accepted that's where he he got real upset because Abel by Revelation knew he needed to lay him and when the lamb met the requirement it covered all of Abel's sins and it will cover all of your sins too and make you worthy to read the book not in your own word now listen if you're drawing back on me I will I've got a quote from Brother Dale where brother Dale said these exact words the lamb makes you worthy so don't draw back on me I'm telling I'm preaching what's been preached I'm preaching what Andrew Glover preached I'm preaching what brother Dale has preached for years I'm preaching what's been laying in the message for years I'm preaching I'm preaching the myth history of these things that the lamb was sufficient to make you Worthy in Revelation chapter 5 it says I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book who is worthy to open up the book John said there was no man in heaven found worthy no man on Earth found worthy no man beneath the Earth that ever lived and died was found worthy no man was found worthy but John wept because if no one was worthy and it could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost you realize what that means If no man was found worthy to open up that book nobody's coming out of the grave none of those saints that have gone on are ever going to live on this Earth again they're stuck where they are the Earth is stuck going off into chaos with all these Sinners living on it that maybe drop bombs on it years from now or whatever and and there's nothing that can remedy the situation that the Earth is in all creation is lost if the seals are not opened up unless the lamb come forth and took that book and broke those seals there was no hope no and brother Branham said that John represents the church so he said if John here had to cry and weep and he represented the church because he was going up in the Rapture then the whole church was concerned here looking for a lamb and I think that behooves us all to be concerned this afternoon and one of the elders in verse 5 said one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof the lion has prevailed but when John turned to look he saw a lamb he saw a lamb that had been in battle you could tell he'd been in battle he'd been slain but he was alive again he had been in battle why why was he in battle why did he die on the cross so that you could be righteous holy Worthy if there was any worthiness it would have to be in that lamb where did it come from it come from the Father Strong now I know we're getting a little bit late on the Wednesday night service but I'm just I'm gonna just get into this a little bit more y'all probably be upset with me by the end but just bear with me a little bit long that brother Bob he always goes along John hadn't noticed this land before here you know he hadn't been missing before but we we need to we need to understand where the lamb come from to see this scene correctly where did that lamb come from where did he advance from in the vision he come from Glory where he's seated at the right hand of God you know when Peter on the day of Pentecost he come from out of that out of the upper room and he began to preach in Acts chapter 2 and he began to quote Old Testament scriptures talking about that God was now seated somewhere for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith un himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand on the day of Pentecost God took a seat in the Old Testament there was that Mercy Seat why was it called a seat because that's where God would sit in Hebrews chapter 1 he said who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins after he cleaned us up then he sat down he sat down and where did he sit down in Hebrews chapter 10 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God he set himself down in Ephesians chapter 2 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places so now when you're born again your soul is actually in Heavenly in a Heavenly place and has seated together with Christ we're seated with him in Revelation chapter 3 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame in him sat down with my father in his throne he sat down in his father's Throne now but one day he'll take his own Throne as the son of David I'm so glad this afternoon that Jehovah God that Jehovah the Old Testament can come and set down in a man's heart and claim him and change him and sanctify and fill him and sit down and take rulership over that man and sitting down sitting down on the Father Strong in a man's heart isn't it strange isn't it strange that a a simple lamb had to take our place that he was the only one that was Worthy he had been on his mediatorial work back there but now he comes forth comes forth from the father's Throne to take the book I'll be I'm closing in just a moment brother Adam said remember he'd been on his mediatorial work back there but remember these seals are ready to be opened and the lamb come from the sanctuary of God Advance forward there's no blood on it no more for the blood-covered lamb has walked away he said he's the one that holds it God's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out boldly I am their Kinsmen I am their redeemer I now have made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them I've come to claim their rights and that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and I've paid the price oh brother Don't It Make You Feel religious not by Good Works which we have done but by his Mercy it's his worthiness that we're depending on as as the musicians come forward I'm going to read what brother Dale said about this just to clinch the matter let's let's put the period on this brother Dale said it's what he makes us it's what he does he's the one that makes us worthy to read the book only through that Holy Ghost that you'd have would you be able to read this book and understand what's being said then he makes us worthy to do it I'm not worthy myself to take that I don't care how good you live or how clean a life you live or what you do you're not worthy to do it but he comes and makes you Worthy he comes and lives in you see then he can read the book oh you think about what a profound statement that is that he can read the book when he makes you worthy oh when you study these things out you'll find out when the lamb comes forth from the throne that is that super anointing that the bride has been looking for when the lamb comes forth from the throne you begin to be identified you can read the book different what what that's that story that brother is written there in the Bible where Jesus Took The Scroll of Isaiah and read from the book and identified himself when you can read from the book and identify himself that is that super anointing that we've been looking for where you're resting on what God is revealing to you as he shows you where you are in the book aren't you glad this morning as we stand to our feet are too glad that the price is paid aren't you glad that you've got a lamb let's Worship the Lord [Music] upon life's boundaries I fixed my hope in Jesus plus anchored up my soul When Trials of fears assail me storms are gathe I rest upon is Mercy trust him more I make good in Jesus the storms of life are brave a
