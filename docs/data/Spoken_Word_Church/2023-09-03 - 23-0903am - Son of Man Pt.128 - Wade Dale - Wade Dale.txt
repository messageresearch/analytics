and Terrance got about the same thing they've got a little stomach problems stomach issues so let's just remember that and remember them also also praise God I don't I I haven't been to the doctor yet but I did get my my chart my chart's pretty accurate I would think yeah well the nurses that would too that we have are shaking their head yes but all all 14 biopsies we're benign that's right that's what we were looking for that's what brothers uh dirty saves what we were looking for but there was two concern areas and they um all came back but none so we sure appreciate that appreciate the Lord giving us Grace a man giving us grace and mercy but we sure do appreciate doctors I you know why I was thinking back there there used to be a thing called exploratory surgery right a while back long time ago they'd have to cut you open and find out what was wrong with you I thank God that somebody created a machine MRI CT scan ever how they got to go up or down they can find out what's going on without them cutting you open like a like a fish but I appreciate the the whoever it was I don't care who it was whirly guy or whoever it was these MRIs and CT scans are are well better so the doctors can can help us I sure believe in doctors I know y'all do too we're not against them none whatsoever so but we sure do appreciate the Lord though because the great physician is the one that we look at and we see that by his stripes were already healed so let's go to Lord in prayer we're gonna kind of deviate just a little bit today because there's something I want you to I want you to praise God about today where the elect we're the bride I want us to show that let's bow our heads Lord thank you for being with us today already Lord in song and worship and I pray this should be with us in the word father you said you sent your word and healed us the Lord May the healing power go from the front all the way to the back and Lord reach out into places like sister Freedom mom and dad and sister Johnny and sister married and all the different ones if I forget somebody in the Lord forgive me but you know who they are Lord that needs you right now and sister Tootsie too the sister Freedom Tootsie being sick we pray that you should touch them Lord and raise them up out of that father we thank you for all things we give you praise and honor that you've even let us live another day that we can breathe and breathe freely and live in a country that for now we can Lord be free and and be able to stand In a Pulpit and be able to congregate together but Lord there may be a time when that's not going to happen so I pray now Lord that we as you told the prophet that we would put things in our storehouse today Lord may we fill up our storehouse as we brought it Lord an empty vessel to use this Lord for your honor and glory and bless your people bless the congregation bless the ones in the Foreign Fields Lord our foreign Brothers Lord we pray that you touch them Father today just ever be with us in Jesus name we pray amen and we do have a few that still that's going out on vacation and we've got some that's going on vacation so we we want to keep them in prayer may have been some horrible wrecks out around the community so we just want to uh prayed Lord's Mercy on all of us in the beginning was the word this is 128 and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory of the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth Jesus answered and sent to them verily verily listen listen I say unto you except the man be born again he cannot see or understand or be a part of the kingdom of God but he's made provision that you can this is what I want to get to today Revelation is 19 6. and I heard it as it was the voice now we look at all these voice it's one voice not voice says and I heard is a word the voice of a great multitude and of the voice of many Waters and as The Voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord omnipotent reigneth in other words every voice said the same thing every boy said the same thing went to different places thundering Waters but it all came down to one place it's saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice not be saddened downtrodden no let's be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come that's your new birth remember that happens down here and his wife hath made herself ready down here all right and to her was granted that she should be arrayed we'll look at that word of raid or or clothe or or a garment thrown over us and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness the righteousness it doesn't say of God it says the righteousness of saints you may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's continue on now we know that we've been talking about being born again and and uh some of you have sent messages that they've had a good time with this and I really appreciate um the positive comments sometimes you think man you're preaching on a new birth again brother Dale's preached it for 30 40 years and here we are at it again well you know what somebody needs it I may need it I need a refilling so I need I need being born again all right seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again that word being means be God again to produce I like that to produce again you've already produced a new birth God has produced itself now what you got to do you got to produce you got to produce produce Christ in other words you've got to produce if there's oranges in your the life of the orange plant you've got to produce oranges all right so if you got the life of God in you we are going to have to produce the life of God not just on Sunday and Wednesday not just part of our life uh and you know our graph shouldn't look like this our Christian our Christian walks we sure it is but it shouldn't look like that our Christian experience should be that it carries us through everything and even though we have a bad day or a good day it really doesn't matter we're heading in another Direction being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible what is a seed that is the word of God so it's being born again by what nine non-truths cannot produce a seed of God all right and non-truth is not of God we'll get to that in just a few minutes down in the church ages there was a lot of non-truth that was not God but he allowed that to happen in Luther's age Wesley's age even in Colombia and different ones he allowed that to happen but he said it would come back to Incorruptible it would come back to full word in the end time and we'll get to that in just a second by the word of God so how are you being born again by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever like I said that word means to produce again be born again are born anew in the message you must be born again brother Brown said look God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning to Jesus's first Doctrine now what was his first Doctrine you must be born again that was his first Doctrine and we find out that there's so many different meanings that people put to it that's what we've been talking about nearly all churches say You must be born again there's not any religion that says well you just need to just know there's a there's a method I guess you might say to some people that to get born again but it can't be a Creed it can't be a dog man it can't be false Doctrine all right it's got to be the word of God nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretations what it means to be born again now remember to be born again as we were saying before it's not got anything to do with the feeling with an emotion it's an experience you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God all those Creeds don't change you all your coming to church don't change you listen to the tapes don't change you let her killeth Spirit given life that's what we'll look at here in just a few minutes because because when we uh in this statue of a perfect man it's got to be the spirit truth everything's got to come together all right for everything to come together we've got to be as the prophet of God told us to be honed all right and then and then um iron has got to fit iron iron can't fit rubber so you got to have the same in other words The Life of Christ is what's growing up and guess what's coming down as a headstone it's the Life of Christ all right so we need to get if we have to let's get back to that let's live the life of Christ all right then all these Mysteries that we're talking about and the voice that we're hearing will be the one that will take us out of here you're still what you were until you actually born again of the spirit of God doesn't change you your Creed joining Church change your idea or good intentions although as good as that might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen remember brother Brown tells us he said that Lutheran Wesley could in other words couldn't get full word because they were reformers now churches that don't have uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost they are reformers can you nod just a little bit louder it's rough Bob you you're supposed to plow this field before me there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place so something did happen in Luther's age but yet God still had to wink at his ignorance when he said we still need to be baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost because that's what the mother Church said and we don't know any different we're going to come out the just shall live by faith we don't have to live by Creed we don't have to live by the um by the Catholic church or the dogmas but then Luther said okay well that's it then but God said no listen that's not all of it that's not full word that's part of the word you got to move on further and then brother Brown said what they all cabbage down he he talks about the Pentecostals they all cabbage down they all stopped as brother Joe was talking about the Wailing Wall if you'll look at them I mean they're moving why because God's in motion God's moving all the time listen in the Garden of Eden when the Masterpiece I'll read it to you in just a minute brother Ryan said when the Masterpiece fell on its face he said God immediately began working to get that thing standing back upright again so praise God that he's still working on me but it's a new birth it's an experience something that takes place so it is not that that brings a new birth in other words decrees and dogmas now the different churches say well except this or believe this I don't want to accept anything Satan can get you to accept anything but when God comes in and burns that old you out and you say oh what a change in my life amen I have new thoughts oh yeah those old thoughts are still there but I've got new thoughts the word has become more alive not like y'all that is a hammer something ought to be sparking inside if it's not sparking Inside by now then we need we need more than walking all over we need to get over get over ourself everybody's looking around at everybody else saying well he's not saying amen so I'm not going to say Amen that's never bothered me one bit Hebrews 11 verse 39 said all these having attained a good report talking about the Old Testament listen we're standing here in a real small microcosm of of this plan of God right I mean we're right here in the moment 2023 we're standing here September whatever it is third all right now we are standing in a day where you say well it's you know it's good weather outside and we got tomorrow off and y'all ought to be praising God just for that those of you that work those of you either don't praise God anyway but we're standing in this this one little day but every believer this is what I want you to get today this and another thing I want to bring out today every believer every powerful Paul irenius Martin Colombo think about this Luther Wesley William Branham is that a place waiting on us to come to a place even the Old Testament Saints because they received not the promise now the ones I just told you they received the promise but they didn't receive full promise because it wasn't in their full time to have it you and I are in the full time that that voice is what's going to call us out of here not out of a denomination or out of a Creed but out of this world and they're not going without us God having provided some better thing listen folks this is the better thing that they without us should not be made perfect brother Brown says now and blaspheme misnamed so I believe the reason that there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit now look if there's a confusion it's about the Holy Spirit all right because if you don't get the Holy Spirit and you don't get the new birth inside your soul Daniel's 70 weeks the seals will never open to you never open to you without the new birth you will never get a correct revelation of these end-time truths or Mysteries without it without the new birth we're nothing we are confused there's so much confusion today about the holy spirit it's not correctly taught that's why I believe that baptism is taught says just a baptism in other words just throw it out there it's a blanket thing it's not listen it's the life of God yes sir that changes your whole life your own nature don't just throw you away and hide you somewhere now he kills it when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that and we've been talking about it for the past several weeks there's a lot goes with that because here in Ezekiel thank God again for a prophet that told us about this new heart that God's going to give us a a new attitude he's going to give us a new way of thinking if he's going to give us come on I mean he said he's taught he went right to the heart yes right to the thing that if it quit beating you're done doesn't matter how sharp the rest of it is you have a heart attack you're gone right okay without some medical help or what more so a new heart will I give you and a new spirit see God was he's he's the one that have you ever thought about this there's nothing new Under the Sun right there's nothing new there's nothing that man has come up with that God of the devil hadn't already thought of and I want to put him in there too amen so these MRIs CT scans all that stuff they can do outside your body without opening you up God's been doing it since the dawn's time God's been Wireless forever he's never he's never needed a connection he just needs you to be what be a willing receptor he's healed people and never even make an inch cut so nothing you under the sun man has just what tapped into God's laboratory and said hey we can take these unseen waves compress them together or what more are these Mac you know if we're a light and magnetic images and they come up with all and that's great fine with me that's okay like I said better than cutting you over the open like a fish and said oh there's nothing wrong so you back up but I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh has he done that has he softened us up I want you to think about you I'll think about me like Bob said judge yourself now if we judge ourselves righteous then we can judge because we are going to be the judge it's like brother Dale's always said if he was if he was standing at the point of casting the first stone he'd have to cast the first stone like why judgment starts where House of God all right but you're going to take the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh in other words something he can work with and I will put my spirit within you now there is the holy spirit there is when God burns your old nature out and what vulcanizes his soul hello somebody his soul with your soul the Master Creator that's the man that can produce anything that he says he's inside of you today about the new birth or he's not and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to want to come to church cause you to want to read your Bible cause you to want to do right we're going to read here in just a minute where we've been we've stopped at it for many many times about this statue of perfect man there in second Peter we'll read it if we get to it maybe this afternoon it'll be this afternoon sorry but we're a brother where brother Peter says that if you do these things it'll make you make you you can't help it that's what I want I want why I can't help it why do you praise the lord I can't help it why do you shout I can't help it there's something inside of me that says amen there's something inside of me said let me out and show the world go ahead because the world sees enough junk so I said before even even out in the world be kind to people be nice be nice this world is like Rob's head so cruel it is the most cruel wine because there's no spiritual Rudder there's no even in the churches there's no what they call Christianity Today would have never made it in an old-timey Church Never Would Have Made It they'd have called you a dog and a devil for what they call Christianity now are we caught up with it though are we cut up the same way and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry in ascended Jerusalem or Tarry wherever you want Terry Terry here until you be endued or put on like a garment now what did it say in Revelations 19 the bride has made herself ready in other words she has clothed herself listen the arbor meat packing guy did not come and close that woman that he went to pick up that's right she called herself she was waiting ready on the porch oh he's coming ah yeah y'all just as as mom was talking to somebody a doctor one time a doctor friend of hers and she's a a good Pentecostal lady but she said oh and this is to me just listen to what I'm saying she's looking at Mom and sees the Holiness and she sees that that Mom she's and she's supposed to be a Christian herself and she says oh you believe all the Bible foreign don't you believe are you a Christian but that's what the world is they look at you and they go oh you're from that Old Testament Bunch are you from that Old Pentecostal Bunch well praise God they saw a difference some of y'all maybe they won't even see a difference in but praise God if they do until you be endued or clothed with power or dunamis from on high and that dunamis is God's power and that dunamis is an inherent power it's something you get and keep now remember he gave them power see he gave Luther power he gave Wesley power come on people he even gave Columbus power he gave them power over evil spirits now this is a disciples before the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and Judas was standing there with him he gave them power or exosia which is a temporary power give it to you take it away from you give it to just like an anointing anoint you to do something and then take it right away from you cast out Devils heal all manner of sickness and all minor diseases he just he just laid the blanket out and said hey go and Judas was right there with him but Judas didn't carry on he didn't believe the word to its fullness but actually see a power will give you Authority all right but like brother Bob was saying man we've read it many many times but if you really just break it down that Pro that brother Brown said power without character so see God's not going to give you a whole bunch of power if he knows you're going to start zapping people out of the way you know cars would be driving by themselves I mean never mind do away with him Lord they cut me off and here goes the car with nobody in it my boss oh he's gone see that's power without character but Power with character you pray for the person because they don't know no better they haven't been taught have you ever invited them to church now you can you can get because you can't say Amen to that hmm have you invited them to church my enemies yeah remember I got two gay guys living beside me and I have invited them to church but you shall receive power after because remember before you're powerless you may have this great strength in this great ability Berkeley but without receiving power from on high or dunamis power you're just a wimp now look right let's see this right here and this is where I want to kind of I want to talk to us just a few minutes kind of a little side note and I'll read you a statement that that I believe the lord gave me while I was cutting grass brother Ryan I'm back on the lawnmower again but it's my personal one so I'm cutting my own grass but but the lord gave gave me a powerful statement and I'm gonna go ahead and state it to you and then I'll read it to you in just a minute but you know I was thinking I thought the devil's been doing this you know working in our communities and in our bodies making a sick making us backslide but do you know one thing's for sure I'm gonna read it to you after I read all this I'm gonna read it again read that and you're looking at us never never since Jesus Christ was on this Earth that Satan never had such a formidable opponent we have his answer yes sir he don't know how to deal with us but never before that's why it's a headstone message that's why the message had to come it brings Jesus Christ back to Earth in a bride not coming on White Horse that's Revelations 19 that's after everything's over with but anyway let's go back over here and then I'll read it to you again but I'm going to tell you how brother Brian said look Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts you say by the way what's this got to do with the Statue of perfect man has everything to do with it you got to realize who you are and what you're doing here you got to realize that God is working through your life bringing these virtues into your life not another group that's coming oh we're just setting groundwork listen there was somebody that did say one time I'm just setting groundwork this is the building this is not the groundwork this thing has come off the foundation and it's a building how to let the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless we see it everywhere listen listen revelation of Jesus Christ now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is God Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there's three gods but it also takes a revelation to make you understand that truth all right so it takes Revelation all right I mean how can you see this God that can be everywhere do everything be a father Son and Holy Ghost and be one person because see I can be a father a son and a human being but I can't be inside of you or I can't be in California I don't want to be in California I can't be in Alaska right but God can because he uh omnipotent I'm I'm the president omniscient he's all those he's God but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one he takes a revelation to see that the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth Satan crept into the church and when they were blinded to it which means they accepted it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are We Done Yet no watch this Resurrection 1953. see I don't want to blame you people it's the pulpits where it started no wonder that the damnation tree got in the pulpit it's the truth failing to preach the unadulterated word of God and the word of God will produce just exactly what it said it would do but we explain it all away I'll watch it for some other day ours for some other group hmm Masterpiece 1964. listen to this this is a good one now notice then this is my piece when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver he broke through the walls and he marred this masterpiece we know what he did because that that's the way he did it what how did he do it I'll go more in detail of it remember he's talking about the serpent Seed doctrine how he done it this masterpiece was wall by the by the word that's word and the masterpiece Excel itself of the family was fortified by his word all right remember Eve was Adam's bride in tight being the bride of Christ right she fell because she got out from behind the word of God but the broken part that was broken off of the original he's talking about Eve went out beyond that wall now we're talking about a church now not exactly just Eve we're talking about church went out beyond that wall it gives Satan a chance tomorrow and now as you know what I believe on these things to my serpent seed but watch but the great Sculptor thank God for a prophet he didn't leave us out somewhere he didn't throw us out in the ditch didn't leave us out on the limb no he gave us some rope to pull it back watch but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruined he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated I'll clap anyway be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again into his own image a man now we know who that man was it was Jesus Christ all right now look Harvest Time 1964 the prophet of God says then Eve met her failure so did the church now watch so did the Tea keeps saying church so did the church so did the church gave away the denomination rules of man to be ruled by man not controlled by the spirit no more she went away from the word and accepted dogmas who can say Amen congregation says amen but do you know even the Protestants accept as many dogmas as they got I'm talking to the message Believers today when we ask Ed this word or take something from it Satan got her with his same old technique he did Eve compromising that's where he got it and something different from the said something different from the word a Creed or denominations pergament Church age how can you tell the spirits apart so much of two spirits in the framework of the church just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one pay attention as the evil one deceived the first two Brides you said who is that Eve and Israel got it even Israel he had a divorce he had to put he had to put Israel away to get me and you now what have we done with it he will try to deceive the pride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds are just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah took the woman told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said we ought to cry that sometime when she did as the word said the proper sign came to the word first and then watch the Miracles the seed word is energized by the spirit How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him praise God his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who call them Vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture the Royal seat of Abraham was like Faith as Abraham will hold on to the word with him for they are predestinated together now in the first seal now he's coming to the seals now he's getting ready to the seals are getting ready to open and watch what he says now watch he said it would be known in the last days but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they though know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church he keeps saying church but now watch notice oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands this he want to mean you people he stops he stops something strikes him and he says I'm going to call you Brian that you'll understand it I'm gonna call you Brian in other words I'm gonna separate you from all this I've been talking about a church because out of the church will come abroad I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it well who's going to understand it just the bride Christ's mystery God reveal listen this then we stand justified in the presence of God as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the statement stainless that ain't no more how many believes that you better than you still got your sin it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropping the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ never to be remembered God forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God Amen and amen now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now we are redeemed now listen to this we have Satan's answer yes sir there's your answer we're an opponent that he can't stand but we're an opponent that's not going to fail God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to This Promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here talk about the opening of the seals amen Christ the Risen Lord is hearing the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer Oneness 1962 love this sermon the kingdom of God is the word of God made back in power we look for all kinds of the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is the word of God Made Back into power so that's my statement I was thinking I thought never since Jesus Christ was on Earth has Satan had such a formidable opponent he swept a lot of good people sorry that all those people are waiting on us some under false Doctrine hello but they're waiting on the perfect one well see remember the Old Testament was waiting on the perfect one too right Jesus Christ well when he showed up there was the perfect one so now where is he at now oh no he's stealing back there in the church ages or he's in heaven or he's over there somewhere no he's in his bride he's not in a church he's in a bride all right so never had Satan had such a formidable opponent then the Bride of Jesus Christ do you believe that I did I did circles in the yard when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you can't get a splutter or sputter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad that there's a ten thousand octane power the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up you gotta have the two and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life our woman's life or into a church that shoved that Cadillac down the road under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waived over the people at the day of Pentecost that's 2000 years ago making him the same yesterday today and forever yes sir that was the first Chief come up from all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of all Prophets we quoted this many times but I believe it more and more today there have been churches churches Brides Brides there's been a bride in every age all right it's been a bride and every age seven of them Seven Ages is already almost passed the seventh one Brides brides churches Brides brides has got to come one there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride that one that has not only mechanics but Dynamics makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection I pray that that's our our goal our goal is not to sit in a garage Hallelujah and rust and rot until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do the Polish the hubs in other words what good does he do for you to come to church if you're not going to do what the word says and the ones of you that don't come to church every once in a while you get born again what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right their highs got to be a dynamic to make it work Revelations 10 7 says but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared in other words a voice has declared to his servants the prophets and The Voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again The Voice to this message this message has give us a voice there's been many voices many brides many churches many denominations but there's one remember that's why it's a mystery you got to hear the voice to get the mystery all right everybody with me because you got to take let's take Paul for a minute we've we've went through this many times but Paul goes and he's getting ready to just destroy the Christians he's on his horse he's on his high horse and he's heading towards on the Damascus Road he's heading to put Christians in jail and to cause them to blaspheme to kill him right all of a sudden there's a bright light knocks him off his horse but there's a voice that speaks to Paul Paul or Saul he said at the time saw Saul why you persecuting me now the Bible tells us in several scenarios same way with Jesus when there was a voice from Heaven said many heard the Thunder many Saw the Light many heard something but they didn't hear the voice Paul heard Paul heard the voice listen others heard other things is that what we've been doing for 60 years hearing other things because I remember we're out here in Revelations 19 there was a promise that that voice was going to take us and make us the bride mature bride all right so in a sermon or you watch or listen to a tape it doesn't matter no matter how loud I can scream only the elect is going to hear the voice of God as we've said before many people y'all all set in meetings and I told you we said well I don't mean meetings I mean right now there's you're going to get 15 minutes of sermon you're going to get your 15. everybody's going to get there different what you need of a sermon but how many people hear the full word of the day and it impacts them that way you think about it you don't have to hey man you can owe me all you want to if you won't do that that's fine but only a few hear the word for their day others just hear a voice a voice it says in the days of The Voice you and I have heard if you've heard the word of God for the end time you've heard the voice of God why did we need it we needed it for maturity Brides brides voices voices voices voices but there's one you better decide whether you're hearing the right Voice or not it doesn't matter if it comes from me brother Bob brother Aaron doesn't make that the vessel at that moment doesn't matter and I heard it as it were the voice of a great multitude now John is typing who the bride he hears a voice and then the voice of many Waters and then the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness of the Saints listen to this real quick 1961 the comforter we have a great heritage a great sacred Trust that's been given us you might wonder now brother Brian you're talking about sunshine great Sunshine of God's glory to make Healthy Spirits to make us strong Christians that's what we're here to find out tonight in other words how do we get these things how do they come where do they come from what are they show me what it is brother Brandon can I buy it at the drugstore what kind of a vitamin is it you don't buy this in a drugstore but there is plenty of it right close to you if you'll just receive it it's just knowing the formula how to receive it there'd be drugs in a drugstore which has got to be a doctor you don't just walk in a drugstore and say hey give me some you know on that wallet give me some of them pills no you have a prescription right what is that prescription that is your protection because the doctors diagnosed your case he has found out what needs to be done he writes not 45 different voices I mean prescriptions uh right usually they'll just give you one per cheap right so that's what you've been given and watch there'd be drugs in a drugstore but there's got to be a doctor to diagnose the case if he didn't it might kill you so therefore you've got to have a diagnosis of the case you just can't go and take a center and give him the Holy Ghost he's got to repent first he's got to be washed his sins away he's got to be prepared for this vitamin that's going to be given him now we have a sacred Trust you know what a trust is we have an inheritance a Heritage that we inherit as believing children it's a sacred trust and that sacred trust and our sacred heritage look it's the word of God that's not been given to Luther but it's been given to us the full word of God the word itself is the vitamin the word itself God's word that's where a reason I'm so dogmatic as I would call it on standing on this word no matter what anything else says if it's not with a word I don't believe it see if you want to believe it that's all right but to me it takes the word because heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail therefore it takes the word then we're coming to the Token because we're coming up statue of perfect man and we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and our token that all that we have need of is already purchased by him yes we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token now he's going to tell us what the token is the word assures us of that promise the token is the sign what is the token the two pieces of paper you in the two pieces of paper fit together they fit right back together just like that all right the token is to sign the purchase has been made for us full obedience watch this is where my thought was talking about the full word of God full obedience to part of the word of God that's not entitle us to the Token of the end time but full obedience to the full word of God that's why we don't live in the Old Testament we live in both of them the full word of God yes what happened in the Garden of Eden we know what Abraham did body change we've got all these great Revelations what are we doing with it you sit here half asleep that's what you're doing with it grief you're setting up your favorite Netflix would that brother say series was on no other way is there that you could ever look be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word fully not what somebody has put into it and add it to it but what what God said about it when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back then shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done boy he's pretty plain isn't he it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to your first big and Life to your second being it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ and if he be divine then we be the branches the life that's in the branch is in the vine it bears the fruit amen so I want to ask you a question today let's stand our feet y'all can't stay awake we'll just close and it came to pass it while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you started believing this message and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether they be a Holy Ghost you can't say that you can't say that Ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be kind one to another as brother Bob had that list up there it's just a reverse of what people are in the end time I mean a total reverse of this world and even their thinking all right be put away from you with all malice and be your kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even for even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you then I'll stop right here musicians come on possession the enemies Gates brother Brown said now be real Reverend everybody now just be a real reverent we've been we've already read this quote and we'll read it again because I I believe in the moving of God but I believe in the movement of God as brother Branham believed in the moving of God be still be quiet let God Speak see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid Holy Spirit just any little interruption bothers him you won't bother the Holy Spirit interrupt him every once in a while we'll talk about the rest of the gifts going up the statue of perfect man but I want you to see Paul even Jesus you know the song Heard it thunder some heard many different things some saw many different things but God didn't specif didn't come down and just you know if you would have been uh they probably now I say this just probably Moses is walking home with his stick in his hand he's 80 years old he's walking home through the desert and he looks out there and there's a bush and it's just burning red it's just like it's burning up well they may have been Shepherds and all kind of people around different places and they may have looked at it and thought man this is that thing's going to burn up and turn around walked off but Moses something drew Moses Moses got close to it and the bush spoke to him nobody else heard that voice to Moses take off your shoes right then you know when somebody tells you to take your shoes off that's somebody in Authority that's not somebody just hiding behind the bush that's God and he did everything God told him to do take his shoes off not remember brother round said God would have never spoke to Moses if he said now now Lord It's Hot this this Sans hot I think I'll just take my hat off no God said take your shoes off you take your shoes off God tells us to do the things of God we should better start doing the things of god let's sing a song God bless you we'll start this afternoon right here [Music] [Music] oh gee Jesus [Music] me hey baby around [Music] for the lighthouse [Music] King Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] see if it wasn't for

there's rocks right here as far as you can see don't come closer [Music] do we pay attention to the lighthouse because if you don't pay attention to the lighthouse you will have a wreck and we don't want to be a wreck listen this life is hard enough as it is let's don't make it any harder but you're the bride you've been called not a church anymore you've been called a bride you've been called to be clothed you've called to be special now not that we make ourselves special but God said I read you everything brother I'm saying everything he said in the Bible it's pointing toward a word-born bride as brother Ram talks about a full word born bride not just pieces and parts this is going to be a full unit that's going to leave this place and Satan ain't gonna know what to do with us he

praying for me then you see it then then Satan he out of left field as you may say Satan feels that power coming to smacks him right upside the head because he's looking at you but there's Saints All Around the World praying and here comes the Power here comes the healing power and I knocks him flat on his face I thank God for that I thank God for the power he's give the bride that we can pray and be confident not just pray but be confident that he's going to do what he said he would do let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day thank you for the time that we have the coming together
