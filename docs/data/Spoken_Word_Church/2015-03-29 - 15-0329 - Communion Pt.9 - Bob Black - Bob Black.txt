========================================

God bless you all and greetings to you so we've been talking about communion the last uh many lessons and that's what I kind of want to I'm going to try to bring it to a stop coach to a hall and then uh brother Ryan I'll take the next Sunday school lesson and I believe or the Wade's gonna start up after that so um just kind of finishing up at the culmination which is the cloud so we'll talk about that with us a little bit this morning hey you'll notice in that scripture we just read Numbers Chapter 11. that Moses got to a place where he's like I can't do this alone I need some help and you know that's really the kind of place that every Minister brother Dale is is trying to get the people where we don't rely so much on the ministry but every person in the church should be led by the spirit we we hear the word and and and of course that's why we come to church so that we grow in Grace and knowledge and we grow to a place to where we're more and more and more and communion with God but we're the the whole church is supposed to be the lead of the spirit that's right and then Moses God said I'm gonna I'm gonna put the spirit that's on you into amen all of these 70 men that's right and then they can take they can they'll they'll be in community they'll know what to do they'll understand what is going to happen what what I want done right and when God did that did you notice he came in the cloud because the cloud is in the presence the cloud identifies that God is on the scene now I'm getting ahead of myself so let's let's go back and look at Matthew 19 3 6. because you know you read through these scriptures that we've read for years and years and and we looked at it one way but now we're talking about communion so maybe just kind of steer your thinking to look at it a different way the Pharisees also came unto him talking about marriage divorce attempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put his wife or his wife for every cause now when we read this let's think about Christ and his church not so much you and your wife are the different problems that we know of and things like that but we're talking about Christ in the church right because whatever what if God put us away every time we stumble and fail you know my goodness can we feel no harm no horrible but and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female right and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall what cleave to his wife I love it join himself together Christ and his bride until they are who understand they're together and John turned to see the voice and it was a it was God and bride form he heard the voice the bride speaking the same thing this is Christ in his bride or the R1 for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and Nate twain shall be one flesh whether they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put us under when God gives you the Holy Ghost there is not one thing in the world that can tear you apart from the love of God and what did God do he came down he left it all he left all that glory on heaven and came down to get us to bring us back into fellowship with him and it's really as simple as that which I think many times we try to make the gospel way more complicated than it really is but God didn't came down to Glory from Glory that stone that came out to put himself in us to tear out all the all the the draws and everything to bring us into fellowship with him that's right so we can go in the Rapture that's all that's how it works of course you know and what I'm going to talk about this morning is a minister can get up and and tell you exactly what it is you can read it on the books and the tapes but until the spirit comes and quickens it it won't come to life in your life that's right and that's the goal get not just listen to Somebody talk about it but getting communion with God because communion is the whole basis for the Christian walk it's the whole basis for everything the gospel is based on old communion and comedian is bringing together bringing two things together two things that are at enmity where there's a girl fixed and bringing them together so there's not anything between them anymore and this is that that uh sermon that last time I was talking about is so uh dear to me what was the Holy Ghost given for and if you if you go back and listen to this brother random clears up a lot of things about the Statue of perfect man he just goes through uh lots of different topics that are are wonderful God poured himself into Christ correct Christ pulled himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you at that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions he gives his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then they'll come and even he'll take his church back to where it left him and back to an Eden again there where where it fell now that's where it made its first start of fall that's where it'll be taken right back with every Clean Slate of redemption now that's what that's the goal that's what God is trying to do right welcome sister glad to have you will so we're talking about communion this morning and your that bringing together starts at the new birth and and it's a little bit easy to talk about let's go brother Wayne's it's been a whole year talking about the journey from faith and communion and and and that joining together how's the New Birth start well first you hear the truth and then the spirit comes and quickens it that's right and makes it alive you take these two things the truth and that all down through the Old Testament they heard the truth they Moses told them the truth uh Joshua all down all the prophets but uh what the Jews had turned it into was just do's and don'ts right a legalism of a washing of pots and pans and I suppose I can't drag carry his dick on on the Sabbath further than this amount of yardage and whatnot and but it what needed to happen was the spirit needed to come and and and Quicken that truth that's right then you got because you know to get a seed you gotta have two things you got to have uh the male and the female and it joins together and then you can have something that's reproducible something that we can reproduce and that's why minister is not supposed to minister until they have that truth Quicken on them so that it can reproduce so that the gospel can be spoken and you can give it out because that's you know that's what brother Brown said the Greater Works that the church would do would be to impart eternal life and how can you do that if the spirit has not quickened the truth and is living inside of you that you can give it out and virtue so in John chapter 4 23 and 24 we kind of touched on this last time as Jesus was talking to the woman of the world the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth that's right it'll be a quick and Truth it'll be something that's alive for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and then Ephesians 1 13 and we also trusted after that he heard the word of Truth first you heard it the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise that Holy Spirit came on that truth and quickened it and made it come alive and now you're sealed you're part of God that's because that's Spiritual Living That's right The Same Spirit just like that story we just read in Numbers Chapter 11. Jesus is standing there like Moses I I want these people to have the same Spirit that's in me and that same Spirit came down in a cloud and in part of itself when little licks of fire on everyone there in that room as as they were they were praying they had they held the truth they had heard the truth for three and a half years and then the Spirit came down and made it alive and then it can grow right that's why the new birth is so important right and we can talk about the statute of perfect man and and all these deep things the third pool and The Headstone but if you don't have the new birth because it's not uh a a ministers can hammer on you all day long but until that word becomes quickened by communion with a personal relationship with God and that Spirit comes down and makes it alive that that's what makes makes you move up the statue of perfect man that ladder of God is God doing it that's right it's not a work that you do that's right but it's God doing it that's right you've got to have that consuming fire living on the inside to bring it to pass now here's what brother Ryan said in message Oneness what happened I said all right I want to ask you something the woman has no egg she has no C he said not only he said I see and she had no seed it takes a union to make a scene is that a right doctor it has to be if you got a whole lot of dirt pulp out there out here didn't have no life in it and planted it out here it would never come up lay there and raw and you couldn't plant the life without having to poop so you see the whole thing as a human it starts from a unit being born again first you you get a union of spirit and Truth at Faith and all the way up being born again like Peter said all the way up you need some more true and the spirit quiz that and you get some more true and the spirit quick as that's man up and up and up and up until you're getting closer and closer to God Amen and and and believe in this word I'm trying to tell you now about Christ and the church it's a union see if the woman is the seed of herself and she doesn't need the mail she can have her baby herself but she can't be she can't have the bathing until she's been with a male because it takes the two together to make a sleep is that right plan to see you with no life in it see what will happen It's gotta be it's Gotta Be dermatized and when we know uh many many that have have heard brother Dale preached you know first there's a gene an attribute in the God and has to come down through that germ to a seed and that's the progress the process Gene germs seed and then it can grow the seed can reproduce itself and so communion bringing together in the mark of the the mark of the bees 1956 brother uh brother Branham said uh it'll never take life until a germ of life has come to it and then he kind of goes through that process that we many of us know also too well the word comes into the mind there's something to consider you know I I feel like many times I you know I I know a lot because we've been studying for for years and we've been listening to the books of the tapes but we got a lot of stuff up here and I know brother brother Dale's mentioned that a lot too that there's a lot in our minds but if that could just drop down in our heart and become real yeah so that's what brother Ram's talking about here you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right well the Bible says so I believe it down into the heart again and then it's a woman then the male sex we are the bride the woman the city goes into the church then the male sex which is the blood cell the blood of Christ is applied and in the blood comes a journal of life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying Abba Father Abba Father my God my God why did I ever do those things my God my God there you are so see it's a you in the whole way up but when you get where this you're standing at believing the world in the head and that's what in this in this church age in this day something's happening that can never happen God the head can come down and Unite with the body join with the body and that's what's going to take us in the Rapture and that is represented the bottom is represented by the cloud the top is represented by Cloud because when you get born again it's the cloud of this presence coming the coming of the Lord and at the top is the cloud of his presence that comes and identifies that he's here to take a church in the direction feel good offset the invisible unit of the bride of Christ he said the first life or your first Union you were joined in at Birth by Nature a natural act a natural human being associated a man a woman together Associated together and sexual Affair which brought to your first life here and that's associated with death sin and death how can you miss seeing the serpency because you were first joined to the devil and God he came down and died on the cross so that you could be he could separate you from get the devil out that's right and join himself to you that's right and begin join unite himself with you you your your first husband had to die right so that you could be married to Christ and and your first Union was all messed up so we've got to be joined to Christ and you're joining him by the new birth of receiving the truth and let that truth be quicker and that's what Jesus was taught God was talking about in Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 to 15 the Lord God said on the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed to belong Callum but every beast of the field for my belly shout thou go and dust shout out eat all the days of our life and I here's that great promise I wonder if this promise has really been quicker than how hard what this is I will put in it I see there when they when they when they took one word off they divided their self they separated themselves from God says there's empathy as Paul explainers in between between man and God because of what they did they're divided now what he's telling the devil is I'm going to put enmity between you and my bride I'll put enmity between thee and the woman then between Nazi the serpency and her seeds the seed which is Christ it shall bruised our head and thou shalt bruise his heel what does the word enmity means if you look it up in strong skin Corners the N word enmity means enemy and now by the new birth God is joining us to where we don't we don't uh we don't fellowship with the things of the world we Paul said it's not we shouldn't even talk about the things that are done in the world it's become uh something that we don't long for we don't long for the things the world we're used to we we uh you know did all the all the bad things and whatnot but now he's made those things an enemy to us and by the by eating the word by feasting on his word we become closer and closer with God those things are are becoming further and further away use the men as an empathy with god with their sin so we were first at enmity with God and now he's bringing us at enmity with the devil and his works First Corinthians 15 25 26 now that word enmity in Greek is translated all through the New Testament as this word and and you you can uh well if you have strong support it's only all that little table out you can search it through but uh this word is the same word as enmity for he must Reign till he accept all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death that's what we're doing on the Statue of perfect man destroying God is destroying the enmity does that make sense I want everybody yes yeah yeah I wish I could just put it put it straight in but you know and that's that's what he did on the cross he came down from his glory to start the process so communion is is bringing together on the River Jordan the Holy Ghost descended and body shaped like a double point and the voice Came From Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son and me I'm well pleased and he was going through the Journey of a Christian of the new birth on up to where uh the cloud appeared on not Transfiguration and said this is my blood son of hearing him now he says speaking conditions why would you expect me to hold a bright Cloud overshadow them on Mount Transfiguration Behold a voice out of the ground we said this is my beloved Son and whom I am well please hear him through gods joining in both at the new birth and at the Capstone and what happened at Sea brother random in the Harvest Time 1964 he's kind of he's typing what happened on the River Jordan with what happens in your life he was Sanctified to begin with by the father then he raised up his hands and here come the devil upon the lamb what was God doing when he put the dove on there he claimed that part of life that was part of the earth the Jesus Seafood like we have in natural okay it was a lot more I think I need to move a little faster and when the man goes into God complete now say what he's trying to do is he's trying to reflect himself that perfect man or woman living by the word see that's that's the Earth that's cleansed he's trying to get himself reflected on a Perfect Bride and remember over in Revelations 21 he said I'll show Thee the Bride of the Lamb's wife and he carried him me away in the spirit to John to a great and high mountain remember last time we looked at how the symbol of a perfect Church a perfect person a perfect City it's all this mountain they're all they're all uh and when he looked at he said I'll show you the Bride of the land's wife and then he showed me in his mouth and he had all the foundations and things that that uh the the church being built upon the word and built upon the apostles and Prophets and all those different things and and look what nothing's going to come in this church in in this city in Revelations 21 27 and there's really no wise enter into it anything that defiles whatsoever worketh Abomination or make us a lie for they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life why because now the church has been purged the church has been purified there's there's no uh all that false Doctrine there's Purge and nothing nothing's going to come in but only God's truth and remember said if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you miss something and it covers the whole plan just like this mountain of God as revealing his words revealing we should be able to see Christ's word manifest in our own life that Spirit come to that truth come to life and and in in the church and in that New Jerusalem just so that all you can't even get a razor blade between what you believe and what what God's word says last time all right so in the Old Testament this is kind of what I'm getting to so we've got 15 more minutes so we're doing good the cloud in the Old Testament was a symbol you know when when Balaam looked down and he saw he saw the children of Israel down there and there was a they had the all the different components of worship but they had this Pillar of Fire in the cloud because it was a symbol that God was in their midst and it knew all through their journey in the in the in the wilderness they just stayed right behind that cloud and that's what the bride is doing today stay right behind that Vindicated message where we've got a prophet that had the pillar of cloud a picture of it over his head we'll just stay right behind that word and not to deviate to the right of the lift it'll lead us to the goal which is to take a body change and whenever a vote around on the greater than Solomons here in 1963 he said now Jonah knew that when Solomon dedicated the temple God Vindicated his presence at the temple by coming in as the pillar of the cloud and went in and went over behind the holy Place upon The Mercy Seat never the ark and uh how much more we deny under our little circumstance right in the midst of the presence of the great God himself where we see people healed save and fill the Holy Ghost because God pulled out all the stops in this day to show that God was here that God was that's one of the hardest things to convince people that God is still the same yesterday today and forever that he's still alive he's not he's not changed he's still in our midst and second chronicles 5 13-14 is the story of of as the retelling of what happened when solemn dedicated the temple they came to pass it came even the passes the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord I feel the house of God had come to fill his Temple and you know Jesus went in a cloud and asked 1 7 11 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and a cloud received him out of their sight I'm kind of skipping over this they said why didn't stand you gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken up from it from you into heaven she also come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven and then we read I look he said I'll not let you talk about the coming of the Lord I'll not leave you comfortable and that's why I was trying to get that together with numbers 11. well that spirit that was on Moses was given out to the people now here's what he's doing he's he's that spirit that was on him to give him power was giving out to the people and it started it started rolling through seven churches that confuses a lot of people when you say well well on the right of that statue of perfect man that said Paul Arenas and Martin Columbus because look what God's doing is down through seven Church ages he's building up a church right and also individually he's building you up that's right that whole process started back then when at the day of Pentecost he came and lived inside began the process of becoming the Lord will you say well the coming of the Lord was supposed to be when when uh God comes back to think of Bride In The Rapture sure he'll come to the Lord is at the bottom and the coming of the Lord is at the top that's right and he came in a cloud numbers 11 12 24 25 and Moses went out and told the people we just read this told the people the words of the Lord and gathered again of the owners of the people and set them around about the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it under the 70 yards and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon him they prophesied and did not cease now here's here's kind of a quote I'm getting at the bottom and the Samaritan Church a brother around said they call themselves Pentecostal and Full Gospel let them prove it at Pentecost the fire came in a cloud is separated over each of them like a tongue and fell on each one and then he goes to explain it and talk about why where is the fire today and and and things but see it started off that fire came at Pentecost in the cloud to identify that he was there he was coming in his church to give them power and it kept rolling down through seven Church angels and then in Exodus 24 15 Moses what went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mouth and look what happened Cloud covered the mouth for like seven days and God didn't speak and people wonder why how was brother Branham out there when the cloud came when the cloud came and then brother Branham went like eight days later and got the message well the same thing happened back in Texas Moses went up into the mountain the cloud cover the mountain the glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered at six days and the seventh day he called into Moses out of the mess of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gathered him up into the mountain and Moses went in the mouth 40 days and 40 nights so what happened up in their mouth that's when God began to impart to him exactly how to build a tabernacle why why did it build a tabernacle so God come and live in that and make his presence known to the people and that cloud came down and lived inside the Tabernacle now what's God doing now because what we read last week with red Colossians 126 27 that this mystery that was hidden from the Gentiles is now revealed that God's trying to put himself inside of people and tired himself Tabernacle himself inside of our flesh and when he went up in the mount that he came down from the mountain and and he he laid everything in order about exactly how that Tabernacle should be placed now everything should be built and then God gave the Ten Commandments and and uh put that testimony in the Ark of the Covenant and you know they uh through four thousand years they they tried to live the Ten Commandments by by truth they had the truth but you can't to really live the spirit has to come and Quicken The Ten Commandments now those Ten Commandments that they have they can really be written in our hearts and we can be written Epistles known and read of all men and if you keep reading through a few more chapters this that those Ten Commandments remember were written by the Finger of God what writes those Ten Commandments on the tables of your heart as the Finger of God it's not it's not something you could do just like it wasn't something that Moses did if Moses didn't write them if uh it's something that God right and scribes into the table of your heart and what did he do there I will meet with thee what was the whole purpose of Moses coming out from the mountain and getting the Tabernacle ready and getting everything straightened out so that God could communion with his people and I will commune with thee from above the mercy from between the two Charities which are pulling the Ark of the testimony of all things which I'll give the in commandment unto the children of Israel so that God could live with his people and tell him what he wanted to be doing which is what we're talking about uh well I should have just read these live and he gave him to Moses when he had made an end of communing with him under Paul Mount Sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the Finger of God see at the temple brother Brown said he announced this coming with a great cloud what was he redoing here he was revealing himself in another fashion this is from the uncertain Sam what was again a glorified transfigure Condition it's coming the way he's coming a glorified Christ transformed his Arabic Shine Like the Sun he's talking about on the mount Transfiguration they were looking at him it's raining shine like the sun he stood in the cloud and he's Conan The Clouds Of Glory overshadowed by Cloud not a little white Thunderhead up the honor but the cloud that he comes in has a Cloud of Glory all these angels women Hallelujah that's the way he's coming and coming in a Cloud of Glory that nobody will see except for chosen people that understand and can know what God has done it's not going to be a great big show that's what everybody's expecting and I remember uh brother Brown there were there were six people in this church I believe that had different visions and stuff leading up to that Capstone Revelation that said of the the birds the uh uh Eagles and trying to recall from memory but said go go out west and this was the first one was brother Jackson's dream that said uh talked about he said all of us here is the way you put it the brother from George and all around we were all around standing in the lit together listening to you interpret that mysterious riding on the stone on that mountain because Brotherhood came and he like opened up the top of this mountain and uh the sun he talked about the Sun the light has never shine on this before looking on this watch this look upon this light has never come upon it before and and then he's revealing these Hidden Mysteries are in this mountain we talked about the stone that came out of the mountain and all these different quotes that we read before and so God this this Cloud came down to open up this mystery so that we can go in the Rapture and and this is the and I want to kind of identify bring out a very few State and looked on to what I had told them very few will stay and listen and and and really count what brought around God has brought to a prophet as something so precious because it's it's this is what is going to take us into the Rapture is the reveal word of Malachi 4. and I'll stop right there that's what that's why I was doing thank you thank you
