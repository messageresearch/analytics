TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised their for spraying their even of one and him as good as dead Abraham ninety nine Sarah close collects they made so many as the stars of the sky in multitude as the sandwich by the sea shore innumerable that's what came from that Union right these all died in faith not having this of this not having received the promise that what is the promises God's going to enter into a group of people and have a brother that's the promise when god in genesis 3:15 that's the greatest promise i'll put enmity in other words here they're living in they're living in they're living in a sinful world they're living in a post eden world where you have to be born of sex you have to grow up and die just the way this and if we don't have any you know what hope do we have like brother george Quinn and I were coming yesterday he said you know you see people and stuff like being in China in different places Indonesia and he said they just walked like zombies he said I had 100 dollar bill in my pocket and he said I was going to give up huh twenty dollar bill I want to give a twenty dollar bill to the first person that smiled at me he said I still have my 20 dollar things went right through the Steve Indonesia he said smile I'm sure that's my god he didn't you know go over Lee god blessed year of hey but he smiled at people he said not one person even from the kids up didn't you smile at me one time put that toy meal that in the park so I see they're just they're moving through life with no promise but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them now what were they persuaded of paper l saw I've been reading in the book or shirt I've been reading in a book of Isaiah now I am kind of interesting brother George Quinn just come back from from Israel with his life and they have the not the original book of Isaiah but the old hold-hold manuscript of Isaiah they have it on display well brother I've said that's the 66 chapters is the 66 books of the Bible it's a complete commentary of the Bible in the book of myself if you'll read the book about that it keeps talking about Redemption Redemption Redemption Israel to be redeemed well yes we're gonna be redeemed but you got to read yourself in that table Isaiah where it says who have believed our report who they are my lord talk about Jesus Christ all right therefore sprang there even a 1 and him as good as dead so many as the stars it's got a multitude established by sea shore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises now the promise the promise genesis 3:15 i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and you hope the seed of the woman will breach the head of the serpent and in other words bring this thing all back together again right that's the promise the promise was to me the promise was is that Adam and Eve we're going to repopulate or populate not repopulate populate the world with us with that Genesis 1:26 man that God said let us create man in our own image in our likeness you heard me that's my favorite scripture that I preached on many many many times that's what comes to you to new birth but what happened with Adam was I haven't had to give all that back till he sinned and when he said he couldn't produce mm-hmm there was no clean womb for him to produce God lived and God wasn't one to produce him a female one oh you know the loins hey this is the womb that he wanted to produce the spoken word is the original see Abraham get the thought and Bob black the thought went to Eve you can see just like what happened to Mary don't say it but spoken word begin unto me according to thy word he would say and then here would come oh boy just so simple but remember what happened was Satan you they to Satan do that so he blocked it he blocked it and got him close one back up the natural one and the spiritual one believed closed it backed up so she couldn't get revelation anymore I don't have a revelation I'm just I'm just this way when Adam and Eve got throw down the Garden of Eden Adam did not quit being the son of God okay so the Bible said he was the son of God now remember his body started getting older he lived nine hundred some years but his body started getting older but I'm telling you he had to be the doctor the nurse the herbalist the physician the pharmacist he had to be the keeper of the land you understand what I'm saying they like nobody but Adam and even the two boys and one of them got killed Abel so Adam still was the god of the earth sorry that's just way I say it they still had to go to Adam I believe to get things natural and he could tell them what happened in the garden cuz he wasn't one to did and then Adam was the one that remember Adams when he sold us out of money he didn't sell us out of Adam soldier side all right but what happened was Adam sold us out thinking he might could get even bring her back into the garden but remember brother Brown said he tried he went out to get even said God wouldn't let him back in yeah cuz remember and you've heard this preach many times before about Adam putting natural seed in the savor mind or that's that's not even that's horrible actually to even think that revelation was a revelation Adam seeds what polluted the earth not made it better great its natural seed no man's natural see you say well what do you do well this is my song the whole thing is he knew what the beach today and he knew he had Adam being the god of the earth he had watched the animals we're never gonna get finished for this channel the animals he saw what they produce what they they they produced actually right and he knew the wound would close up at a certain length of time well he knew he didn't get to Eve that the whole race she he had to kill he would have to do away with her because she would have Steve in the Beast and then that was wound would be closed and he not tell her but he took her to his self and not to save her really my thoughts on it was the save himself so that was his lineage then he's trying to save he's not trying to save that be splendid keep trying to save his lineage being guarding her he knew all these things but he didn't have sex with Eve saber he never stayed he planning to stay in her no he didn't he did it because not to save her no he did not you can't have a setback in salvation period pricing that's what killed us huh that's why we're dying that's why I Adam but to preserve life to preserve his lineage he knew he had to do what he did not to say berkos remember he went out and did that and he didn't get to go back in the garden comes remember Adam I've been the god of the earth but he was not the Savior there is one Savior next Jesus Christ which came without saying and you and I are going back to being without sex in our new birth the new birth wipes out remember brother Graham said it zeros out the sex act that brought you here Oh preach that mother yeah anyway so stop there but true I mean it's and I heard so me all the way many so it's wrong if there's right it's wrong it's not even back to me that's vulgar to think that in your mind then Adam would have to have sex with levy saver well number one your one on one do they man because they're so anyway but be careful you know why until some big-name preacher preached it yes some big-name noted preacher preaches the same identical thing and then all you know what you do you don't study now you say it just because somebody else said actually me another Georgia talking about you know we all my life in the Baptist Church you know Mama's walking on the streets to go with Jesus you go try to tell them people attacks a lot you must keep your mouth shut or they'll be doing your funeral the next week you know why would that storing grain and the people why don't you burn it over but it's um it's I know I don't have the exact believe the saver there is no salvation in say Amen sorry then that's one guy so problem to start with but I don't couldn't listen Adam couldn't kill Eve because she was literally a part of him not like man kids know she he was lit they were literally one person and he could same way with Christ if you see how the the Christ though being our Savior can come to this earth but never have a sick day he goes through the womb of your mind to give you the new birth makes love to your mind not be dirty it makes love to your mind and that's what it is implants the seed word in your mind you see why this is why that meaning many preachers brother Brown shouldn't you be careful with money women and popularity become with this other day why because your plan see a preacher every Sunday is planting spiritual seed well if you don't have enough spiritual out of it spirituality about you and let your flesh take over it won't take over the whole ego but that's why you see many preachers commit and dr. Klein women are attracted to that good morning that's right that's why you have to be careful brother Graham said money women popularity that's the three things everybody wants to be popular yes yes any money is included all that but remember the Brian Jesus Christ we were when we were born again we were made we're being made love to by Jesus Christ but it's not the very thing that we're we all got here that's why we're dying so how in the world late we had them do anything to make her raise her up no he had to go out with her and he had to start making sacrifices no okay but yeah so let's go get caught in that trap because Moloch over our name friends our name brand person told us that's not true I've done I keep those clothes I don't have a living where brother man I said Abraham's natural seed is what the luthier and you remember that remember evening how see a woman doesn't have the scene right you can only repopulate the world with a man see and that's what's killing us so how can that be a Salvation issue no sorry people that's what gets us in trouble is hey you can't be one word off and take a funny thing you cannot be so everything's going to be riding back to where they can't be up and you know what when one brother Dale preached that several years ago about against how about what I'm just saying somebody had preached that in our church from the same country and have it correct him so you just can't sorry it's just because one big-name person went over there 10 or 15 years ago and preached it and we heard appreciate group so just you know just cuz your big name person don't that's the money women popularity park you better go check out what brother Dale says - yeah that's less whatever or me says to you that's why your best but that's not that's right cuz you know you don't want to sway the thought through faith often say let me read this name ago they'll receive strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful to that promise then what now the promises now look the promise wasn't that Abraham that Adam and Eve was going to have babies sexually they were going to have babies by the spoken word that's right okay because brother brown preach the spoken word is the original seed anytime you hear by the seed if you're a Christian you should not think of man's seed but the Steep Word of God the storm went toward to so see he was so into good seed remember and other one was the other kind of Steve well it wasn't sperm okay let's just be honest it was see the word this is the seed and you got a plan and once you plant it you gotta let it grow so they didn't receive the promise but they looked and saw it everybody let's go everybody since the dawn of time who was waiting on this time [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're on this Hebrews 11 been on it then only we had got to but verse 4 so let's just continue on this get through this all right so next day next Sunday well do the next Sunday and then somebody's got you at the next Sunday Hey but what happened we're leaving and going to the brother bridge nights next weekend then Sunday but I'm not gonna preach morning because he asked me to preform the next weekend so he's gonna be gone and he hasn't nobody preached so I don't know we're going up and going service with him next Sunday but then the next Sunday I'm going back up to preach 125 right all right so by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous now listen Cain was a righteous and a degree like we're talking about he was right because he did the right thing it was revealed to him that it was blood not cantaloupes and oranges and potatoes because his brother Joel always said how can God blessed something that's cursed and that's what all Cain brought him with all the gifts of the earth and God had already cursed earth right so God testifying of his gifts what to gift the offering of the Lamb and by it he being dead yet speaketh now will may talk about that a little bit more because out of the ground Abel's blood didn't speak but one spoke was is the testimony Abel had Abel was killed for what he believed all right and he was killed by another religious guy named Kane so brother Branham was talking about the end time where you don't have to physically feel people anymore you can just kill their influence and you kill that person right and we see that a lot especially in the message too so just be careful with that by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God that brother Brown said he pleased God was wrapped in faith Enoch had faith to believe and he walked with him for five hundred years okay he walked through God for five hundred years remembering it was he was then part of all them remembering that son with Methuselah we have known in 69 years yes well anyway you got all those genealogies looks like in the Bible just there and I may be wrong I think it's so important they're eating at the food we're all Kenda they're all kin to each other go there what many of them in not will never than that okay it was translated that he should not see death tight brother Brown stop talking about typing Enoch that's the end time bride that's going to take a body change and then remember he types Noah which is Kenda this is great granddaddy know up wrote over the flood but remember that was sin when he got to the end of it but not with Lena so ain't no tops Doubront raptured bride it's going to be raptured before because remember Enoch was taken up before the flood so he didn't have to deal with the flood for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God look what mom said though but without faith it is impossible to please him lose him God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is what did he have done brother George and I were talking a few minutes ago we're talking about the Mormons and all the different ones he'd been in contact with and he was talking about a certain religion that was talking about God and Jesus will see that and it's public notice I mean I'm not saying something I shouldn't say on the internet the Mormon violence begins by saying that Maroma had these tablets but that Joseph Smith was what had an audience with Jesus and God at the same time few people Jesus and God appeared to Joseph Smith I said well I just handed them back the Bible I said here I said I can't go with that it's false to anything after that my brother George didn't say after that's false if that's where it came from it was a lot all right you know sorry about that but still people even one true and living God Jesus and another man can't appear to you and yet be Jesus and God okay so yeah but millions upon miss what we were talking about millions upon millions believe that they're Mormons anymore into the second largest religion in the United States the richest besides Catholic Turkey so they must believe it somehow that the course of people even a Trinity you have them popping up all over the place right so well we know we know that's what we become invalid or comment but by the scripture and by the prophets message we know we don't have to guess we know that if it's not by the word is false my brother Graham told us over and he says he said it if you've got two people one's got to leave the devil and one's gonna be gone because can't have two guys standing in front of me so for long she'll be saying but without faith it is impossible to please him who God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently what we've been talking about diligently seek Him alright that's what we've been talking about is what I've been talking about brother Dale has been talking about even brother oils and the different ones that come by and little notes in there about doing good doing the little things and doing what you supposed to do read your Bible study go to church go to Bible study and you wonder why you know some people wonder why they're not getting anywhere well are you doing the ABCs if you're doing the ABCs then you need to work on something else to me when you get in this message then you see that what set in stone that can't be changed is what the word says alright and if it's a word and it says in here I'm doing it then see you're out of the work so you'll immediately you go what I need to do in one hand go away and I like even brother Branham the other day some additional quotes up nobody with a problem and somebody's talking about something you know brother Brown told us how spiritual is this brother Browns issues if you're standing see start giving stuff away right he just say going to prayer closet and start praying to God to change it he said you're stingy start giving stuff away he said do the Bible verses you look that word path diversity says four thousand old mansion but most of the time is that if you're this do something else then that's just kind of really too simple you say oh brother I need a lot I need a lot to come down into the room and I need somebody to prophesy over brother ground did I prophesied over the whole bride told us what to do you still like a cross I didn't go that's just too simple i faint no one no watch but faith Noah being warned of God of things not as not seen as yet now remember Noah grew up in a civilization just like we're in them but they had never seen rain never never read your Bible the ground the ground itself was actually the water table was so that the top of the ground that the water table would raise up and it would make the crops grow close really to be real I need to be real scientific it doesn't matter how much it rains on the leaves the roots have to get now sure there's a little bit of soaking up but they soak up the sunlight not the water because the water drips off the leaves and if you don't understand being a hunter I like all my fruit trees though you put out your fertilizer you don't put it out next to the tree trunk you basically don't spray it on the leaves you go out to the what they call the tap roots which is now to your youngest root is at the very end of your longest branch you know why because when it rains guess what that's your first sucking umbrella that's your first part of the brain that's going to hit the ground is right there with your fat roots need so same way with with God we see that Noah never saw anything called rain it wasn't they couldn't do --gel they can google rain it was not a word I could have a Google they are Google now they've gotta have something back then you never know you know and yes it's already enough rain the rain it had to be Janice's after the flood or at the flood because before the flood the ground is what the mist coming up from the ground that's what fertilized earth or whatever you want to call it because you know remember the water table was God made it that way that's the original way it's gonna be because remember when we go back to the Garden of Eden we're not will have rain will they tell me of a home I'll be on this guy though they tell me tell me of a nun cloudy day it won't be clouds in the sky brother laptops many times won't be clouds not even be just and that's one but what I'm saying is look at the faith Noah had to have Noah had to walk out to the world to the United Nations and present his program it's gonna rain and they go like that words not in here right yeah what do they write things not seen as yet move with fear thou not fear is in but he knew God had talked to him and told him to do something dad I'm sorry yes that would be a rebel you look at that deal I see what that means hmm hmm you bet cheap not given cheap he prepared an ark for the saving of his house in here and no ago now it gives him a big field contain impossible is no doubt getting him a big field buys him up you know 100 acre feel a hundred acre field and he said I'm gonna build a boat and the people are going be over 80 what is that come boats not even in there maybe you know maybe not back side of a boat I'm sure there was water but not either thing rain coming right prepared an ark to the saving of his house but I remember by the which he condemned the world how did he come down the world he condemned the world by doing one God said he condemned the world by building the boat no bills the boat saved his family but condemning the world is 120 years brother Brown said he preached it will rain it will rain it will rain and I'm sure everybody brought their quote book to the minister meeting and told him that wrong he was no I said already he became heir of the righteousness which is by faith those remember Noah became heir of the righteousness which is by faith he just believed same way with this next guy right here by a vase Abraham he believed when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for America oh babe that's our that's our whole deal right there oh babe and he went out not knowing whither he went so that's what faith will did faith will take you somewhere that you think man I don't know about this but like the in doing we're talking coming up the road I'm talking about life faith man you gotta take you take it by faith and then like I've always told you God's nose or the best edges you'll ever get so if you put athletes before the Lord or if you say Lord I wanna buy this car or whatever counts and the deals just keep falling through well that's God telling you no and you can say praise the Lord but I won't that no you gotta obey God listen those that have the Spirit of God in them should be led by the Spirit oh that's right okay now I know as human beings listen we make terrible mistakes a lot of time did you know what it is we overrode what gods told don't die now anybody else in the world you call it luck out there if you want to but I just don't believe in luck right right I don't believe that I don't believe Abraham was what the only bloke Noah was lucky no he did what God said right and they're not eating fried they're not even children of God hello they weren't born again they had an anointing they know when no one come out of the ark and first thing he doesn't built a vineyard and started getting drunk so it showed that he didn't have a lot of salvation but he was saved but he didn't have the new birth all right same way with Abraham Abraham being the father of my face gave His life away twice were tried and laugh to God so thank God doesn't look at all that of us either he just wants it what our end will be the faith he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise now remember when Abraham first started this journey saying will you put yourself in this position when you first start your journey you really don't it's being a Christian it's like I told you before you're the bride of Jesus Christ and everything so hunky-dory and God gives you whatever you ask I know six months or so into my new burger God would just you answer my prayer you know why was the baby and he didn't want me to fall down and get hurt a whole lot so he just kind of held me alone but then after that he went on vacation and I want anybody home but you know what he wanted you to he wanted you to believe when he's already saying you don't have to come back and tell us this again you don't have to it's already been say it and God's just waiting for it like we were talking about the other day the vision that God saw were just waiting for it to materialize right and that's the same way we label him Abraham called the vision of God that he was gonna have a child now remember he he went through a journey a pretty hard stop he went to Egypt he went to he went to different places and they got him a wife or not wife died in the concubine to you concubine and had a child by it but that wasn't that promise Ishmael wasn't a child but he won the promised child right video now we're gonna go around doing dumb things but those who endure to the end she'll be safe somebody over there so let us say that's going on but he had an inheritance now remember Abraham didn't know it when he started out you don't know what totally what your inheritance is but actually kept knowing God kept saying okay everywhere that your stroller your feet walks I'm giving it to you as an inheritance now you didn't tell him that at first he just said Abraham get up and go see that's justification that's the same way it is in our journey we were babies we have to be led and God leads us to a place but then he finally leads us to the place and he said okay all right I mean you now dress for sin silent that's our problem we don't we we don't trust him so much that way alright so by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country that's thinking about this other day but my Walmart and seeing the idiot I don't know don't call me it's they're human they just humans that are blind it they're blinded obviously there is no more mirrors in people's home cuz when they walk out the door oh my lord you know he's like a bouncing ball now you go oh oh oh you kind of have to thank God wants to look up be careful when you look up if you're in a two-story house but I'm telling you though they don't see nothing wrong with us or what they're blinded they're literally blinded man I hate that because every one of them could get salvation and get cry and be right but their choice is not that way I was thinking the other day and think about this what just makes you wanna cry Bill Gates is a multi-billionaire with all which we had some money like him he's gonna have to stand before the wife I'm gonna peek and I'm going again and I'm not all the Clinton name of all name of all all the great man poo one day Jim he doesn't get born again he's gonna have to stand before this guy that we're talking about which you and I are not now that don't make your head swell up that makes you humble to believe that God has give us something that the great men of this world you know you think who I wished I was a great but we've all said that wish not the great baseball player I was the highest office in this world is the biome in that's the highest offices in the world not Supreme Court Supreme Court justices are the apex of the land thus far is saying yes this is right another but you know what they get it wrong abortion and all these different things that they they and they've done the best they could I'm not saying anything against them but one day those great judges are gonna have to stand if they're not born to get you hear what I mean fair not born again they're gonna have to stand before the greatest judge and it's not just Jesus Christ it's us it's Thrones when they open that book there's Thrones what you and I have been standing there and all the great men of the world the greatest you talk about Henry Aaron in Muhammad Ali and all these great people that people look up to and admire and the reason I'm saying this is because Elvis died 42 years ago to life so there's no was Presley the greatest man in the world at that time though but you know what we know what his problem was brother Brown said he sold his soul for a fleet of Cadillac so you know the greatest man in the world you know maybe maybe went Judgment Day comes they'll open up a an aisle for Elvis to walk down but I'm gonna tell you something he's gonna stand before a god and a group of people that's gonna judge that man but what he did if he's not born again I keep saying that just in case there is there is salvation at the last moment all these things I'm telling you what I'm saying is look this promise that he gave Abraham he gave it to us because you and I everywhere we walk that's why I believe Jesus told him said go preach the gospel into all nations baptising my name you follow something when you've done that the end will come why because we need a foot sitting in Japan where they hadn't been a believer they're in now they've got they got messy churches and never was one China Russia Indonesia every country in the world some believers don't have to step foot on that piece of property I just believe that so that's what Jesus was saying going all the world dispersed and wherever the sole of your foot I don't care if it's Antarctica where there's not 500 people living on that basic continent its place anywhere that a bride puts their foot that's the position of the whole whole earth is for us that's the inheritance so listen have faith then it doesn't matter about all these great people that we look up to and we do we honor the president we honor because it's an office all right we honor that because it is an office as an office that man's come up with and you know you're gonna deal with it but one day that person if they're not born again they're going to stand before the judgment seat and be just right or wrong where you're standing there in the righteousness of God and when it's all wiped off and over and done with we're going to step right back down here today we don't okay that's right that's why we don't judge why the Bible really says let the word judge now we know that the word does good written really come on people the word judges you every day you don't have to have a preacher standing in your ear every day you shut down the Holy Ghost in your ear every day that's it all right I feel a little check oh well now you know turn a little bit let's don't do that right and you know what he's still timid till we go on and do it anyway remember you said well that never happened to me it happens a prophet yeah twice never got telling him to go out on a failed Heath because of his mother-in-law and his wife he didn't when you see what he cost me right they went in Africa with those brothers and they said we'll go on this waste and all the Lord says not then you know member brett.lavender vision was God drew a line in the sand don't go any further well guess what they talked him into going so you see what a man you can you can be careful with with stepping over the will of God because remember it wasn't that it was a success as far as people get healed and stuff but they all pay for it so till we pay for it we just have to be careful what we're doing it the same way it was Abraham by faith Abraham didn't have a quote book everything he didn't have a Bible he had no self-help book he had no Joel Olsteen to the look at her whatever you want call it her or nobody zero it was just Abraham saying 'we would know him nobody didn't have anything to go on abraham had a little bit more to go on noah had nothing to go on rain waiting rain it's not even you can't google rain not before the fall I mean before the flood but now they for him received an inheritance he obeyed and that's the same way with us when we get an inheritance by obeying the Word of God right right by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country remember you won all these different places Egypt Canaan career he went to bill read the Bible and I used to have a little and maybe in the back to some of the old Bibles the journey of Abraham you watch ReWalk I mean he covered the whole like Middle East Iran Iraq Israel Egypt tanning the different things where Abraham wall to see God said where every soul you feet and he left tell me later on wherever the stole of your feet stats that's your inheritance he said Abraham looked up can you count the stars look down can you count the sand he said no he said well you're in arrogance they're your people will be as that sand of the sea and thank God were included in Wehling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God now he didn't look on a map but v was waiting where he was waiting for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker done because remember Abraham was living in a time where he did journey he dwelled in the tabernacle of tents different different places he didn't have a city if you'll look Abraham I had no city that he was related where they just said he was from the earth shall be then he got up and went to this town and God wanted this city even got onto this city then in the plains of Mamre wherever that is it's where he met no kezzeme all right now God met God in human flesh free look for a city which hath foundation is built or make her gut now what's wonderful to me Abraham look from this city his whole life because he knew there was a promise that he was going to live somewhere but the problem was his he didn't have enough revelation at the time but thank God we got a prophet that came in the end time and he said the very spot now brother Ram had to get a revelation he had to get a vision that the very spot that Abraham took communion with Melchizedek he said that's where the city's gonna push up and the city he was looking for was right up under his feet he didn't know it but see we know that though somewhere over there in Israel wherever he was standing that there's a pyramid-shaped mountain it's 15 miles this way in this way in that way lay this right under their feet and when this is all over with it's just gonna push right straight up MA I believe it's there already I don't believe it has to be created I believe it's there mm-hmm because whatever happens to the rest of the earth it's not gonna matter that's down under the earth and then the city the pride of the city is going to come right down on top of that mountain what a beautiful picnic it won't be a vision when it happens so the city he's looking for we've already found we know exactly where it is and we have a prophet come in the end time thank God to give us that vision of that insight that's why I said we're prophetic people because prophetic people can put these things together you can read my neighbor Hammond and Stevie that you're looking for then when brother Brown says right where he met Mel Cassidy took communion needs to right there under his feet that's where that thing's gonna push up when he's the only window that geologists don't know that nobody else knows that they what no other preacher would over them say anything about them but we have a spiritual Einstein that could see something that we can even see through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed
