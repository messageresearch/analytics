Revelations 1 John 8. remember now to a few of you that won't be gone this next weekend or this coming weekend Bible study will be at six o'clock so remember that come let's Fellowship together and then as Terence says maybe his announcement will we do them where make sure you get it on the internet and people want to hear or come and be with us now remember our Easter time together will be on the 18th we had originally said it would have be the 25th but we couldn't get the building so we'd have to drop it back to the 18th that's on Saturday he's made these announcements and things of what to do and then you know the doing now the Lord willing we're going to have a service here on or have a time here together on the 4th of July which that will be on Saturday all right so it'll follow it perfectly for us to have a time together and hot dogs hamburgers or something whatever you want to cook we'll have a time together and in the afternoon and then have our Bible study at six o'clock we always do be here now the the Fourth of July will be here that the Easter one will be down at Gillsville at the park but just remember that and is as of right now it looks like that we can't make it permanently steady but brother Vernon is supposed to be with us for that weekend the Lord willing so we're going to try to work it out to get him to come over and be with us from the 4th of July that will be our time together you know when we can celebrate kind of our our time that we've had because we started here on July the 4th 1971. so then we can I think this will be my 40 years as Pastor be coming up this time they kind of thought it was last year but it wasn't it's this coming time so remember that okay any other announcements I generally forget something but anyhow okay all right if you'd like turning your scriptures Revelations 1 and John 8. the heavenly father we thank you for your love your grace your time your opportunity to allow us to be able to come together because it's not our opportunity we didn't have anything we didn't want anything we were not desirous of the things of you but you were desirous to fellowship with us and now you're able to do that through the blood of Jesus Christ we just ask you now to have your way with each one of us as we come tonight and try to speak a little bit about you we ask that you would guide each and every one of us in your love and your grace as what to be said Remember the sick among us you promised it that we believe you we thank you for being with brother Benny there today bringing him through the operation now this make everything else to fall in line till it all will be totally well and no problems we love you we thank you father in Jesus name all right Revelations 1 where we've been reading and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle now we've been aiming to get to that scripture for now for 20-something sermons but we're headed that away so the Lord willing we'll try to get there eventually but you know we don't know what that really would be meaning back there if we did I mean be meaning in there of what to see unless we see what was back there to bring it to pass so that's what we're trying to do John 8 and verse 30 and through 32. as he spake these words many believed on him then it said Jesus to the Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and ye shall know that indeed means without any limitation that's it you know that's that's a great statement and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word then you shall know the truth now not know about truth see which ye shall know that word no is a a great understanding when job said I know My Redeemer liveth he wasn't saying I hope or maybe so or whatever he was making a very positive statement so then I believe and I want to do a little bit different tonight in what we're going to to try to bring and all but I thank God for the truth that has been brought to us in this last days now even if we miss it we should be happy about what we've seen what God has allowed to be open unto us of just the natural things I mean you know when I say natural I mean the things that are not even revealed unto us but to be able to read the Bible and think about things that we used to be so massively confused about in our thinking that it is gradually come becoming more clearer and you know we used to question well why did God say it that way you know he should have said this or that or whatever but see we're finding out that he couldn't say it any better way there was no better way of saying it because one thing he was saying it to hide it from the wise and prude it but on the other he was saying it that way to reveal it to the babes which would you know listen and learn all right and that way then ye shall know the truth there's never been an hour on the face of the Earth to me that there has been the amount of truth of the word of God that is here now all right I believe that even in the time of the Lord Jesus there was no writings you know there wasn't a lot there to be able to study or to talk about you could hear about it or or things like that and what brother Branham one time made a an outstanding statement of like I forgot what it was but we'll call it one thousandths of a hundred percent even knew about Jesus Christ it was a great majority of the people never even knew anything about him all right and see then down through time look what we've had and now even though the bad part you can still go on the internet now and and pick up the end time message and be able to read it now that's a marvelous thing and to me it is now it may not be to you but the many questions we had that's why I write in my Bible a lot of people said I ain't going to write in my Bible That's the holy word of God well that's true but my memory is too short all right so they say that the shortest pencil is better than the greatest memory well I write in my Bible what brother random explain that scripture as to be you know and I then when you come along you know we we're doing some things in Bible study years ago and Josh had my Bible Well you know uh they they wouldn't let him use my Bible because they called it to cheat cheats you know because he had the answers to what something we would the question would be asked he could read it off the page of of my Bible so they they say you can't use that tonight but you know to just be able to do like we do on the um Bible study time you know we just simply are going through the book of Romans and we just take a few scriptures we read a few scriptures and then we just comment around that an understanding of that and then we have open to where they face questions about other things we bring that in also but to the majority we just take the scriptures read it and talk about it you know expound on it what's the words you use you know not that we're any good but just talk about it and see we can say well thank God Sinners for Prophet amen amen and to be able to understand all right now we've been quite a while in the Book of Genesis and getting kind of everything laid in order and I want to if I can tonight to pull us through the scriptures and speak about some things and then maybe pick up a little further into bringing it more down to our time and all like that throughout the you know in the following services so we want to that's the the goal anyway all right now you remember how we went through in the garden and we talked about how or the way that Eve was deceived by Satan's sceptility you know his deceptive points that he could do and he's still doing that today but brother Branham says on the unveiling of God that this bride is going to be tried like Eve was but said she won't fail well he was looking at to the end of it to see you know where it's at and you realize that even just to think about uh that's what I'm talking about the truth just to be able to think about what we what we can read and comprehend you know and all like that and and she's not to be deceived but it's going to take the truth to keep her from being deceived now part truth you can be deceived all right I didn't say lost we ain't talking about none of that when he talking about whether you're born again or what's he doing we're talking about that you could be deceived but a random one time even said like this he said frankly it would get the bride so confused you know deceived if you want to use the point he said God would have to cut to work short now what he means by that I don't know none of my business but I do know that's his words all right but see we've seen those things because we were able to read the Bible for ourselves and then take the message that was delivered unto us and let that be the answers to the previous questions that we once had all right then that way it's not exalting a man or or anything like that it's putting it in order of saying thank you Lord for what we have received all right see in that way we we don't we believe that the messenger was not you know infallible because he was a human being right well he made mistakes and things but the message is infallible all right I believe that now I contend that away and would be glad for anybody to try to come and show me now that I know so much but uh you know come and show us if you think that that the prophet didn't have the truth all right don't take the things that are where he himself made mistakes and I'll take the message that comes through and that way you'll have the truth all right see because this message is the truth all right not part truth it's the truth all right now so let's just take a little time and do something that I love to do and all and uh you know I love to just read the Bible and to just you know just read it and just think about what I'm reading you know I love to do that I love to just just think about it and you know and sometimes you get caught up in wording I realize that because that's the difference between the the uh writings and the the things and and I go back and I look up a lot of words and things and uh write the definition you know I'll go into Strong's and I'll pick up the definitions and Webster the definitions of the words and and I'll write them in my Bible right beside there where you know that when I read that then I have it I don't have to go back the next time you know and look it back up but you know to just be able to read what a blessing just to hear let alone that being revealed to us you know because the world is massively confused over the word of God right you know it's massively Mass confusion to just say well I think it's this and I think it's that well that's what gets me in trouble I guess because I'm not too much on what you think because I'm not too much on what I think all right I like what one brother said about it one time he said he told his man said my church don't care what you think said my church don't care what I think he said is what the word of God says well that's that's the way I want it all right now so let's do something a little bit different tonight instead of preaching and and reading quotes and now I will be quoting all the way through because you have to do that to tell where you get what you're talking about because we definitely uh start number one we did we definitely didn't know the answers right of the things that are now the Simplicity of just reading and saying I understand that you know it was mass confusion and it's still confusing sometimes of the wordings and the things of the Bible because it was written to be revealed it was not written like a newspaper to be just well this means this and that means this and you know it wouldn't that away it was meant to be revealed all right but to just read it so let's do that now we'll just start off and I want to just read the scriptures and then just we'll just simply walk through the scriptures you know one by one and trying to uh understand what has been brought unto you and I as the ability to where we can believe and be able to read so let's start off with it and we're going to be basically in the in the Book of Genesis but it'll be on the board here to us but go ahead and start number one and we'll just read these scriptures and think about the things that you and I know that is really amazing what did you used to think about when you read in Genesis God made man his own image and well I guess he might look like you know well I didn't know because I think God is just like a glob and just floating around and just you know see we didn't it wonderful to be able to read the word of God and to be able to think and know what we know about it and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them not him one see them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the iron and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth see you think that I I guess sometimes you think I bore you maybe I do with it but see I could stop right there and preach the half a dozen sermons because I believe that's me and you all right if you don't believe that mankind is supposed to have the the ability to lead the animals just remember they're still afraid of you in the natural but then you know some people have an ability with animals to just walk up to them and just the meanest of all and just no problems and see look at the prophet and like I said there for a moment in time nature saw its Master when a man could stand and tell the Beast to go back or tell the bull to go and lay down I believe that's for every one of us I know what the quotes are from the people and some have made it they said they didn't believe that that the third pool was for nothing just for brother Branham and the Lord Jesus well then why write it what was the purpose of having anything written and brother Reynolds said it was for the bride and the church unto the totally lost that doesn't mean anything brother Dale I've I believe well see that's where we put our understanding all right so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now we understand the him and the them don't we if you ever remember when we read it and we had a hymn and of them you know him and of them and and it just keeps falling backwards and forth and we we couldn't understand about why it was saying those things now we understand that the first man that was made was what he was made male and female all right it was a them it wasn't him it was with them see all right we understand that because he made them male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them watch now back in the spiritual condition because we know in knowing that Genesis 1 26 and 27 and through there is a spiritual man being made in the image of God because this is not the image of God in the bases of of our physical part in that much even though he did come down and I believe he looked like us but yet still the image you're talking about is an exact likeness or a repeat remember how we brought that out that that's not a second person Adam and Eve wasn't the second person that was God made manifest in another form of the way that he wants us to be all right and see then it would come down and even in the spiritual condition he says to them and brother said Eve you know heard that and that's why Satan could talk to her see Satan heard those things too and he said eve don't you remember you were told to multiply and replenish the Earth well see we can all we don't under we don't get into that you know what we get into be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth well there must have been another world before this one you ever heard that was people more people were created other than Adam and Eve well I just go back to one scripture that Eve is the mother of all living and that solves a problem but see that people don't want that they want to know what why does it say replenish go and get your Regional and read it it says plenish it doesn't say replenish replenish seems to mean you've had it once you're going to have it again all right well see we don't look at it that there's going to be a spiritual reproduction right I thought we believed in spiritual reproduction in the bases that the seed comes through the body and that you have spiritual reproduction by sowing the seed of the word of God and it being revealed that's some you know spiritual multiplication I thought we believed in that but that's just just to take some points that we've left out upon what we're doing but didn't bring it on through but let them have dominion our Dominion is this Earth God's Dominion is heaven that's quoting brother random all right what she said and God said behold I have given you ever herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the midst in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me now that's while they were in the spiritual and God showing them that he was going to put them in the natural right they were in a spiritual condition which you did not need to eat right you don't eat in a theophany it's not you don't have to do that it's not dark all right but see knowing that then we see it and we understand what was taking place okay going to the next one number two which drops us up to Genesis 2 7 because we know this spiritual man that was created all right then he was placed into natural flesh you know made created all right then Eve was taken from Adam and look what it says in the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul all right we've seen from the prophet that that was eternal life breathe especially into Adam which went as we've studied and brought it in About Eve and how that she came forth with eternal life we gave the quotes you know to show him to what it's doing so anybody on the internet if you want these let us know all right but look and God Lord God formed now uh not spend too much time I guess I wish you would get down some days and get that down and understand that there's capital l o r d there's a lowercase that here you know back in the where is it I'm looking at scripture today and it says he talking about God brother Maloney he didn't like those terms because he is a you know is a pronoun instead of a noun and he didn't like the word he or it speaks in the Bible of the Holy Ghost and calls it an it well it can call him a he with little bitty letters but the only thing I've asked you to ever remember you remember that that when you see that little G the little L and it'll be in the same verse a lot of times remember one of them was speaking of the Great capital L O R D is the Lord God Of Heaven the other is speaking of the form that he moved himself down into to be able to reveal himself to hear that's just like in in the New Testament there when it says God is a spirit you say you got to start off a a sentence with a capital it doesn't start that with it with a great capital but over in Hebrews it says God in Sunday at times in diverse manner check that one out that's a great big old geode in a capital letter it means a lot maybe not to you but it does to me because in that way what I do is I look at it as to think about brother Branham standing out there and the great God of Glory descending to a human being are the prophets or the people and to see that they would call it Lord you go back and check where brother Randall says look at where there are of who is this male charity he said Abraham called him Lord me not just a little l-o-r-d the very capital l-o-r-d it means a lot see that's what I could have went through a lot of things but I just want to take verse by verse and just put it through but he said in the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed now he's he's still in there he's not separated out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that he promised while ago he would do when he would be put over you can eat of the the trees and the thing every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden watch and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now it's a funny looking tree why can't science figure out things why can't great Scholars read you know I mean it if if they can't see what took place it's because of their unbelief because it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right now the prophet said there was two trees in the garden they said the tree of life with Jesus Christ he said the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he said that is Satan yep all right two trees you could have eaten of every tree now like I was saying the other day what if sin had not entered the picture then we could have come forth the way God had intended for it to come because why because the tree of life was in the garden and remember in a minute when we get on down to the scripture they were put out to keep them away from not just going in the garden but away from the Tree of Life all right you see then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil if the tree of life is a person which is Christ didn't he say I'm the way the truth and the life all right see then Satan is trying his best to enter the human race some way right because he knows he's defeated the way he is and he's trying but he's a tree of knowledge and that's not an apple tree in a pear tree but they were actually told if you'll go back and study it they could eat of the trees that's what he started off we'll get to in a minute they could have aided the tree of life he said well I don't know about that well then God sure did goof up when he said put them out lest they partake of the tree of life but look how specific we'll get to it in a minute he said put them out lest they partake of the tree of life and live forever he didn't use the word eternal life he used forever because you can't be in it for an eternal sinner all right just the points that we've not used along the way all right the tree of life was in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right Christ was there but so was Satan all right so it wasn't two apple trees or you know one walked up naughty looking tree and one good one or whatever you know or some pomegranates or whatever it had to be something else and being that then look what it was all right two trees jump on over we got two verse 9 going up I'm leaving a few scriptures out because they're not taking so much verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree now this is before Eve was created you know physically before she came into flesh he's speaking just directly to Adam of every tree of the garden I may ask freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thy shall surely die now you can think what you like but I believe that Adam had a great knowledge I don't think he was worried about Eve climbing up into a crab apple tree and biting off some bit or something or a prune or a you know I think he may be understood a little things you know because he would probably as I said one day tell Eve said eve it's not time it's all right you put what you want to but listen but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil don't eat it don't touch it because you'll die you see like brother Ernie makes the the illustration where the Villanueva you know that they put on aprons to cover their nakedness well if it was Apple you should have put one over the mouth and and put you on some mittens on your hand you know to cover that part of just apples and things but yet see we know those things now and we know the truth because we never thought about these things until the Prophet come to bring us the message we read the Bible and we could pick out certain things because I used to read of the writers as much as I could and I enjoyed Scofield and and a lot of his writings and a lot of schofield's writings are true but after finding the truth of the message of the hour we can put a little X across that one and say that's not right you know but yet he still had truth on a lot of things you know he knows if you're reading your your Scofield bible right down in his footnotes about the Beast that he knows that that was not a snake but it was made a snake he says it you know he he knows that part because that's that was the understanding because he said it's not to be taken like a snake but it says an upright creature all right but see the knowledge tree of knowledge but around and said they could take a tree take a bite off of the tree of life and he said you can live forever but he said you take a bite off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and he said it'll destroy you every time he said that's what science is doing is eating off of the tree of knowledge amen and the Bible says you know there's nothing withholding from the imagination of man's mind you know what he could think of he could bring out a lot of you ain't old enough to remember going to the old movies and things in the in the late 40s and you know and seeing Buck Rogers as interplanatory travel in a spaceship with ray guns well it wasn't even thought of hardly back there in the scientific Realm and then from that time of the 40s to the 90s we went to the Moon you know because that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil remember it is good I like air conditioning I like heat I like to ride in a good car you know right we were life in today then at the hospital and and uh sister Brenda was saying something about some shoes I said yep my time we had one power that lasted all year and I said that was your Sundays and your all during the week time you know was that one pair of shoes you didn't have two power and you'd you know you went barefooted until it got frost and then we were in swimming but time we got hit the month of March and and you know and things like that and running without her shoes because we knew we were going to wire them out and we didn't have any you know because that was just life as we lived but all right but listen the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I didn't spend much time on that having it so I want to just drop a point or two do you realize this message as Paul said to let her killeth this message without the Holy Spirit to reveal it will destroy you exactly all right amen amen without the Revelation it will destroy us even though you can quote everything amen amen and say well here's the scriptures here's the things I got it written down I know what was said if that's not revealed then where are we do you understand what I'm trying to illustrate that this message without a revelation is part of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I ain't talking about what happened back in the garden I ain't talking about all that I'm talking about the plain truth of the Bible that this message will do nothing but destroy you you know I really enjoyed what Wade had to say about the the where they knew they would run up that on the uh the people you know in that Mr Expo would be texting and running up brother Branham and and getting all of the first ones are the real bad things you know and he gave them an illustration you know that that they didn't agree too much with John the Baptist back in the days of their computers and uh you know they didn't agree with the Lord Jesus because they took him out and killed him you know because of their doing but see that was the tree of knowledge because lest we be beguiled as Eve was through his septility I wish to God I had revealed in my heart what is In My Head by knowledge I don't claim to have it revealed all of it but I do claim one thing I will be glad to discuss anything that's been revealed to me now some of the things that hadn't been revealed it's going to be my opinion and yours no brother I've got the profit well okay that's the tree of knowledge because this knowledge is what's killing us destroying the people with knowledge right you see why I try to preach by Revelation to get you to see it where I was listening today coming back home to brother Branham where he was talking about how he said I've tried my best to get to Branham Tabernacle to get away from just being little kids let's grow up you know he said because that's been my desire to see the church grow in what in Grace and knowledge you know that knowledge is on the pyramid but now that's not the tree of knowledge there that's Holy Ghost revealed knowledge the Holy Ghost reveal knowledge will not destroy us it will carry us forth and that's why I keep pounding on a half for 50 years now about this message because I believe this message is is the part that we need revealed all right that's why I fought so hard to try to keep the truth in this little building to the bases that you know I could have been very popular and accepted among a lot of the things but I don't want popularity I want the reveal truth regardless I've got to walk by myself I will walk by myself in it because that is my goal and my desire and I'll you know and everybody says well that's my desire too well all right let's go let's sit down and talk about the word you know we were listening what was last night where brother Branham was today I was listening because I hear in good many take where he's talking about that your experiencing this today on on the Hebrew series one he said you know people would ever put everything on an experience he said I don't put it on an experience he said I put it on the word because see you can take your experience and do anything like the Bible says Judas went and hung himself and you go do likewise that's two scriptures but that is the word of God huh but you see why that we are eating a lot of time off the tree of knowledge even though we're reading the Bible and saying the Bible said it right how many of us believed in a trinity don't raise your hand just remember it how many of us believe hell was eternal how many of us believed all of these things until we heard of the message well we swore by it didn't we before the Bible said it will come find out that wouldn't want it was saying that's what I'm talking about you shall know the truth you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free revealed word is what I'm talking about revealed word is to truth to me you say we've got the truth all right the brothers you know they're good about doing it say well you put this one out here and you line up with that and that back here well that's real good and I understand what they're talking about and I understand but around them and lining up but also understand what he says he said if you move one Higher he's a shooter of guns at hundreds of yards or an eye out of a squirrel at 50 yards that he would not even shoot if he couldn't do that you move it one Higher in a hundred yards you can miss a long ways so holding it up so we got it lined up well you know the way I've got this holding it I'm holding it because I can't just stand the paper up well this is doing pretty good but I got that one bent to hold it now where am I going to shoot I can't illustrate it that way to the Natural where am I going to hit but we got the word the revealed word is the only thing that's worth anything I don't care what you think I don't care what I think I care what is revealed all right now that's what he was saying about an experience if you get something that's revealed to you that is your experience that's the experience I want then you can have all of the manifestation of gifts and signs and wonders are wonderful but if it don't agree with the word yeah but the Lord told me what does this say what does the prophet say this is what the Lord said I don't care what me and you think about it let's see if we could get hung up in a lot of things and stay a long time all right but let's move on where'd we get to pull up number three about Genesis 2 16 17 but we'll go to 20 where we want to go to and watch what it says and Adam gave names to all cattles into the fall of the iron to every beast of the field but to Adam there was not found and helped meat for him now remember it doesn't say mate says meat because meat is more closer to togetherness whereas mate can signify just two men or whatever you're talking about so the word is perfect Lord God calls and and you'd be surprised how many people quote that is m-a-t-e even though the Bible says in me too and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh and stood thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now remember what brother Branham said of what we were bringing out in the stories we were coming through that there was no help meet for Adam and brother and said he was lonely now he was in flesh in the garden leading the animals and and doing all the things but said he was lonely there was no help meet for him if you remember what he said he said because part of him was still in theophany and said that would make him lonely because part of him was in theosomy and part of him was in flesh all right that part that was in theophany was Eve right all right you see Eve then finally was separated after the rib situation and they're bringing forth and she was brought out of Adam and placed in a flesh and called woman see now you'd be surprised how many of us will say and she was called Eve and we know what we're talking about that's sensible but the Bible doesn't call her that the Bible called her woman because that's what she is she comes from man she did not get the name Eve until the fall because we'll get to that in a minute Eve means the mother of all living we'll see it this situation she was not so her name was not Eve her name was woman now brother Maloney used to try to explain that in the Hebrew Greek or whatever to me and and I could see what he's talking about but I didn't understand those things uh but he said that the word woman means that a man has a wound you know a w-o OMB not meaning he's a mixed up pervert but when it happened with Adam and Eve coming from Adam then there was an ability brought forth to reproduce Adam so it was really would mean a man with a wound need to bring forth all right and I thought well that's good that's I don't know but you know but he made a woman and brought her unto the man and said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh Who Shall be Called woman and that's why I argue so much or hollering screaming to people about the byproduct the byproduct I know marriage and divorce I know what he said I know where he used the word byproduct but I know a lot of other things he used to buy products about this people don't want you to read word that God didn't go somewhere else that he took from Adam in the original creation Now Eve was in Adam in the original creation right I guess he just decided a while well that rib right there looks like I'll use that rib no no Eve was in Adam they were even told to multiply and replenish the Earth while in their spiritual condition okay see we're learning the truth that can take away the questions or should you know but she's made a woman and brought her into the man and said and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man all right therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh that's what marriage is supposed to bring unto us a situation of one flesh and the way you treat your flesh yeah I mean that that woman is part of you know I guess the situation develops it we think we didn't get the right flesh so I need to go out and try to find my other part you know that don't work too good either but that's what mankind thinks well it is it to the point that we think well she just flushed and I'm the great and no supposed to be one a man and wife is supposed to be one loving and kindness to each other right not hateful and you know me I get too much okay all right let's drop on over just reading a few scriptures jump on over to we'll start in Genesis 3. I don't think we need to spend a lot of time explaining the literal act in the garden as much as we spend upon the time of the spiritual condition and the the uh what caused Eve to go wrong in her spirit in her memory reason conscience affections whether you want to call it Soul or whether you want to call it spirit it's always in the memory reason conscience and affections but see that takes away a lot of things from me to just know that you know brother Branham did explain Body Spirit and soul you know at one he spent it Body Soul spirit and then later he would come and say Body Spirit and soul that would be bringing together things in the word of God that you're you're too Soul people and all of those people use those quotes you know of a quote in in the 50s but they didn't want nothing after the 50s you know I told him one of them one time I said well you know you're talking about Soul being the nature of this period I said brother said on on souls in prison that the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how can a nature be a nature I remember you standing right there in front of the old voice of God Recordings I said I don't know why don't you ask him is he because he wasn't going to listen to anything you can take brother Ryan's message and make it say anything you wanted to say but if you take the message now the letter of the page is you can do it but you take the message and it won't declare nothing but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever remember where I was quoting a while ago where brought around said that this eve would not fail he said the first original Eve was he was deceived on Hebrews 13 8. yeah you said well he didn't even know Hebrews 13 now she didn't believe him to be what he was either all right but think about it the serpent was more subtle so we know at the time that we're getting to that Eve had already been removed from Adam things has been taken and made and they're there in the garden all right then we know now see the serpent was more subtle than any Beast now we know that there's a difference between a serpent and a beast and we know that he was a beast upright walking around because the Bible says that we don't have time to get to it that upon thy belly shalt thou crawl so we went some other way before then so it was an upright Beast he was made a serpent by the curse that was placed upon the Beast because of of what happened all right and he said unto the woman you have yeah hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and like I said if she'd went and said Okay hold it this is beyond me now what did Brother random explain he said now if you come up to a question about something sisters and says you're talking to somebody said um paraphrasing it but it's pretty close said the thing to do is say now wait just a minute I need for you to talk to my husband or my pastor you know because see she was you know he's saying you're you're going to get caught because the Bible says she's a thousand times easier deceived you know than the man and he approached her remember how we're bringing it out he approached her and she began to preach to him she's a good woman preacher he began to preach to him well her first sermon should have been Hebrews 13 8. at her first sermon in Hebrews 13 8 it would have ended the whole rest of the situation so you see why she doubted it and got to that point which says we may eat or the fruit of the trees or the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die she began to explain to him the word right men women are preachers may I put it that way all right I was with a brother in a certain place one time and he was answering questions I saw immediately that they had him pinned and uh you know but it was his presentation it wasn't mine but I've seen immediately as he began to squirm and draw up a little bit and Stam her around and uh he kept looking over towards me I said would you like for me to take it he said I certainly wish he would well because see I knew the answers that they needed in the word of God but my point is it's hard to get preachers to depend upon preachers you know well I know I get in trouble with my mouth but have you ever thought about a woman preacher have you ever thought about a man with a woman preacher spirit that makes you think don't it brother boy a woman with I mean a man with a woman's preacher it means you're perverted it means the inability to receive and accept the truth so then you're right back where Eve was all right see that's what we could have went through on a lot of it but we chose not to using it a little bit tonight we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden with the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die if it's just eating you've got a problem there because you ain't supposed to touch it either all right and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die because we say you know it's not to it around him would say see he added only one word and see you've got two or three words changing but it means the same it means where she said ye shall not uh he said You shall not surely die she said we shall die all right and it's doing it but now look God doesn't know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil remember it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right and the Wonder Woman saw that the tree was good for food that's where we lock down on that part and that it was pleasant to the eyes now watch though and a tree to be desired to make one wise even if we went with the actual Act that we believe the sex act that took place in the garden between Eve and the Beast how would it be something to make you white wise yeah all right she took of the fruit in our oven did he even gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and their eyes were open and they were there the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold what fig leaves all right and what happened and made themselves aprons now you know what wrote around said about thick legs he said that's a religion but have you ever thought about why it says fig leaves because any fig that I've ever seen I know over and Israel will have thick trees we have thick bushes but in Israel they have fig trees I mean they're tall trees the one we saw it though uh foreign the one we saw there was a tree about maybe yay big around and probably 30 40 foot high but any of them I've ever seen has the same form about them the leaves are really uh scratchy why would you want to put on a fig leaf why didn't they take a maple or an oak or popular or a uh one of them things in their swamps uh Palmetto uh you know why don't you take some kind of big old Leaf thing to put it on you know it took a little time to sit there and sew together even though you make a small maybe but they put fig leaves isn't it odd have you never considered the point that Eve still being the woman preacher that she was still anointed because brother Brown said your religion is your covering and he said they made them a covering you ever thought about Israel being called a fig tree might have been a little bit better understanding back there than what we think that it was a fig tree and Israel is called a fig tree not called an apple tree a pomegranate or maybe she had a little understanding remember she wasn't uh a dummy okay up to you they heard the voice now you'll have to take this one his brother Brian saying it because he said it like this he said see they were back in the bushes having Church remember that one right they were back in the bushes having Church with their fig leaves on see they thought they had the covering right their thought their religion was okay and watch it and they thought everything was all right and they were having Church now what would you be doing having Church no he's still preaching right you just didn't tell me you didn't tell me the whole story I remember when we were in theophany that God said multiply and replenished here said the Beast just explained how that was to take place she brought around me I quote him she was deceived the Bible said she was but said Adam was not when Adam loved her now think about it brother Tatum I used to get to tickle at him he used to go around to a lot of the meetings which he was in some of the different ones but he'd tell about old Jack Cole he was pretty rough about his wording in doing and uh he he just took somebody's glasses off and he's going to pray for her he'd take glass off just stomp him let's crush him somebody come up with got a cancer in my stomach he just hit him as hard as he can hit him right in the stomach he said go on you'll be all right said blood just squirt praise the Lord healed we said Sometimes some of those people would use a little bit of discernment and call out things and brother Brown and remember in his early days did a lot of that and he said he felt checked and didn't do it as much my point think about it Adam and Eve was going to church having a good time done got it figured out they wasn't as bad off as they thought they were they had them in good covering until God Walked In The Crowd when God walked close to their Church they got afraid brother Branham and some of them Jack Cole to call them out so you're running around there's no hear nothing's running around that in but around said I quit he said cause that can cause death you know but my point is our religion a lot of times is pretty good until we face the truth let me say it this way why did those 42 children get killed because they were out making fun of oh bald head right well you know where they got that from was Mom and Daddy sitting at the table talking about old bald heads why don't you just go on up forget it and you know what the kids begin to talk about it you know whose fault it is a lot of times about our kids and the way we say things you know it's our fault you know that a lot of you on the way home sometimes are talking about you didn't agree exactly what brother Dale and you know what your kids are laying in the back listening to you oh no okay see our religion is okay another random fuel to read just keep reading something you hear him explaining and said you know they had a good religion but this is his wording he said religion is okay but said it will not save you you need that quote I got it laying right over here religion won't save you so that was Adam and Eve rejoicing look at the world today rejoicing over their religion and what are they doing feeding the poor sending money to the world I'm looking at the paper today where they've taken up for overseas or they're not even religious but you know I'm sure mohammedans and religious people three point something billion dollars that they'd already made up to send to some country and see we're just sending millions of billions of dollars a year to feed the poor and all like that and thinking that's going to get us to heaven you ever notice nobody goes to hell anymore you don't hear any preachers say that I had Brothers a good brother he put two dollars an offer and play well all right religion what do we got religion or salvation me all right well see salvation will keep you and listen you are not afraid why did Brothers say it like this he said you're to see the faces on those people when they know they're going to be exposed what about it do we have religion or do we have salvation this message is religion without it being revealed that's all it is it's a covering no more than any other organized religion well you're not talking like that about is it the truth have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth about it you know what I'm getting at I'm not thrown off on the message I spent half the service of bragging about what we had to because of us happy but when it comes down to it is it just quotes and ideas can you explain your revelation without having to quote brother random and I don't mean that you don't quote wrote a random because that's all right I'm just asking you could you do it like wading them was having to do it with Ernest Brothers is going to convince them that the Bible shows that Elijah's coming shows all these great things that are happening without bringing brother Brown's name into it until they bring them up to the date and the times and get them in you know into thinking of what the Bible say is the truth man you know they didn't know the Bible said that 10 years ago or something like that but it didn't change the Bible you know that brother Brown didn't have no books to quote right amen you know what I mean he quoted a lot of books a lot of brother Brown's things as quotes out of books he was a well-read man now when you're talking about reading about what is it the uh Macbeth and things like that I ain't never read nothing about MacBeth and don't care nothing about it but he evidently had read some about it because he knows some things about it you know all right well read okay you know but look now let's take that verse 8. and their divorce of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God were amongst the Trees of the garden now physically we've got a little sense okay we got a little sins okay there were a lot of trees there and they had their church over the bushes because it's free to come out all right but what about the trees that's when God had to run him out he said cause that partake of that tree of life and they they was getting very close right getting very close thinking about how good it would be and what it is and what's going on all right amongst the trees well you know if those trees were trees alone as the Bible says which is talking about man as John was seeing it uh I wonder if we was back there kind of hanging around in the bushes get off come on Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou now brother Branham said he didn't know where Adam was he said or why else would he call or aren't they now we said with the omnipotent the omnipotent God knows everything okay I'll be glad I'm glad you thought of that because that brings me back to where I was while ago this l-o-r-d when it's capitalized he knows all things this Lord God Lord knowing all things but then it puts God with it in a little form or middle case because that way God that part doesn't know everything now brother Brown I'm like come on you got a quote he said Jesus didn't know everything he said God father didn't reveal it to him okay you understand what I mean that's the reason it'll use those lower cases a lot of times because it means God can actually be down here with you and I fellowship and right here and sin can be right over there and him not know it but he could know you and what you're doing right see because he lowers himself in another form you want to call it an angel it's okay because the Bible will say the angel of the Lord and Abraham was called him Angel the Lord said it was God all right but he said warrant thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself now the religion will hold you Adam you're in the presence of God won't hold you people will walk away from the presence of a real god-called person women men istors whatever they'll walk away from you and talk about you but they won't talk while they're in front of you people notice that could it be they know better than to talk while they're in your presence but when you get away from you you know I'm in the Lord Jesus down there and raised the Dead and oh man hey oh yeah we're Believers because it's not where we started with it and many believed but as quick as they got to their self they quit believing him right see we think our religion will cover us but just remember it's got holes in it why did he say I because I was naked you know it had to have something to do with the Mankind and his doings and we know what that means and what took place see when they engaged in the act that they did then they become naked they didn't know they were naked until then that's the part of knowing the Good and Evil right and he said who told me that thou was naked now God asked him the question hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said to woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I didn't eat all right I'm gonna pass it off right around and said Pius the book you know pass the book he said then she turns around and said the Beast is what caused the problem he said pass the buck anything we can do to try to get out from under the pressure right and Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat he defiled her we know what happened we know what took place the Lord God said unto the serpent now remember he made that serpent yet but it's interrelated because this serpent is the main serpent it doesn't talk about the seed of the Beast it's the seed of the serpent serpent is Satan Beast was an upright creature no problems that's why he'll call him serpent and then they'll call him Beast when you know it's not right in saying that he's a a serpenter and a beast but he's a beast and then made a serpent but it will go ahead and call him a serpent why because this is Satan God's dealing with this ain't that poor little beast he couldn't help it it's the main guy the one that had was having church with him while they were in the bushes the one that was telling him it was all right remember what we brought out the act that they physically done is a manifestation of an attribute the unbelief is the real wrong that serpent was there the whole time talking to Eve through the Beast right the beasts no problem with nothing and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go now he's made a snark Serpent and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life but I love this one and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman not to be East in Eve there's no enmity between beast and Eve come on be sensible the Beast with nothing it was what he was just used I'll put enmity division separation between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed not the Beast sure we know the Beast seed was planted into Eve we know that but that's not what God is dealing with he's dealing with the serpent Satan because Satan's seed was what was planted there right but you know what I love about it I'll put enmity between thy seed now enmity according to Paul and the third is the carnal mind now we're right back where we've been for a while on the Eve in her memory reason conscious affection is where the problem took place right and that's where ours has taken place where Satan deals with but see that's the first promise of the coming Messiah that's the way rhodaram explained it I'll put in between I see now to actually Define this you've got to move this scripture way down to get it in the right order because he really said it this way brother random said it he said when they was going out of the garden foreign he said God looked down and couldn't let it happen he said he cried out I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman as they were leaving the garden he gave them the promise all right look now watch let's get to this and we'll quit and of the woman he said I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception sorrow shalt thou bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband because she ate apples I hope we're not that carnal anymore because you ate apples well now when it was pomegranates well I don't care if it's peaches grapes and thy desire shall be to thy husband and watch and he shall rule over thee because of what she done now if you want to get natural with it just for a second and thy desire shall be to thy husband there's what the difference between the man and the woman that's the part that was put there but the difference between Eve and the animals because her desire can be at any time okay but look and unto Adam he said because thou Hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree which I commanded cursed is the ground that I say my point ending it up on what brother Branham said God never cursed Adam God never cursed Eve he cursed the Beast made it a serpent he cursed the world but he never cursed Adam and Eve you need that quote I got it laying right over here he never cursed Adam and Eve just put it under a conditional situations and problems her desire is going to be to her husband and she'll have trouble with y'all bearing we'll let her let you know what the regional sin was all right but then his part was not cursed but it was put to the point that you'll have to make a living I had it all fixed where you didn't have to work I said now you're gonna have to work make a living not cursed as cursed all right we've got it as we're going through but we won't go through it I'll just say it for a little bit and state it see then when Cain he comes along he kills Abel and God puts a mark on Cain and people want to say that's blackness you know Darkness may I quote the prophet he said if that happened it would have ended it to flood because after the floods you had the sons of ham salmon you know the sons of Noah he said that would have ended the curse if you said it would be in black or a black person a negro as we would say African he said that won't work we were up at a meeting in the Carolinas and they were having questions and answers and these two really top-notch Elite guys was handling it and they asked the question said what was the mark put on somebody did what was Mark put on Cain and both of them stated they did not know well you know what I didn't either as smart as I am I didn't either nobody was coming back down the road and then a certain little brother sitting outside of me he used to be little he's a little bigger now and uh because he lost a little higher on top of the head too and a few things old brother Cauley was coming down through there and we're talking about that and I said well brother I really don't know the full answer I mean I could give my opinion he said I know what it is I said what is it he said I just listened to a tape the other day said brother Branham said to mark of the beast that was put on the mark of the beast was what was put on Cain I said well Glory Hallelujah because that's the truth it wasn't a Blackness mark it was the mark of the beast which was rejection and turning away because you keep on reading and it says Cain went out of the presence of the Lord it doesn't say God drove Cain out the only thing he'd done he put the swords are turning the way to guard the way of the Tree of Life that they couldn't get back to there and live forever but it wasn't no Mark of a Blackness or a certain way of doing this and the other it was the mark of the beast because he rejected God don't you remember God even said Cain if you'd done what was right and you want to approach from the prophet where he said Cain had an opportunity it was offered to him right but he wouldn't do it so it turned out to be the mark of the beast thank God for the truth right they don't always unto thee upper echelon elect and I say elect I'm not making no lie to nobody sometimes it comes to the little simple not saying brother Carly simple he just released in the tape he'd heard the prophet I told you about sister birds that time and I preached all night long on about that he said I come from God and went to God and I've done everything I could to get the people to see it and sister Birds going on home and and she she never would even have a vacuum cleaner she'd know how to turn the thing on we went and bought her a stove one day and she looked around all them things she said no it's got to be one to just a button she didn't want nothing else because she didn't handle nothing else and we were going down the road going home and she said brother Dale I see it I said okay well good she said he's come from God and he went to God said he's God the whole time I said sister ought to let you preach tonight I said I spent two hours trying to explain that you put it in simple words he was gone all the time because it's simple isn't it thank God for the truth come on brothers thank God for the truth that you you and I can just read the scriptures and understand things that we never was able to understand to see the truth unveiled before our eyes of God's word and then see why that you see if it wasn't a sex acts in the garden you know the thing that took place why did Jesus have to come by the wound of a woman why couldn't he been spoke out on a rock me you could just spend years of preaching on the things I was thinking about it today on what brought around was explaining the Apostle Paul and and talking about he went for three years and he said no way would he put his uh anything on his experience he said he had to have it on the word he said no Bible scholar would put it on experience he said he had to have it on the word you know what I got thinking about her I thought wouldn't that wasn't that wonderful you just think of three years now Paul knew because this is where I just thinking Paul knew certain scriptures about the Messiah they were looking for him he knew the the things that were said of that he could tell you about Isaiah and the promise and the things he might have been able to even told you of that in Genesis that I'll put enmity because I've always believed that those Pharisees and those people knew about the serpent seed I've always believed that ever since I heard brother Ryan tell what it was I've always believed that those Pharisees and time because why would they tell Jesus we weren't born a fornication like you you know what they were telling me you can't preach you can't be a preacher because we know who you know but think about it Paul out there for three years he'd say he's saying Lord I know about this and the promise and the things and then he'd drop back and he would read the scriptures and he'd read and I said just let my mind roll you know and he he'd read of of Joseph and he'd read about how that he was you know the coat of many colors and the many things and remember brother random didn't say you could see Jesus in every verse what did he say he said if you can't see Christ in every verse see brother Paul could pick that up and he'd say oh there it is there it is there's the Christ and just roll in my mind through a lot of the scriptures as brother Branham was talking of how that Paul began to see those things and he he let me write that down in for three years 24 hours a day seven days of the week I think Road around actually come on I think really is technically says three and a half years but what about all of that time in getting this Revelation from the scriptures that as he would read through the Bible he'd say well that's what that means that's why Moses was told to build a the Tabernacle exactly like this and how come Noah would build an ark for the saving of the household and he said I can see Christ you know I just thinking as he was saying those things about the great time Paul was having on the back side of the desert now nobody to argue with nobody fussed with all he had was the Scrolls need just sitting there reading them no wonder he could explain when he got over in what it is seven verse 7 of Hebrews about Melchizedek because see when he come across that in his mind he could see Abraham and the promises and the unconditional Covenant and then he would come down and see Abraham talking to Melchizedek and he'd look at that and he'd say there he is again revealing himself right through the word as it unfolded he didn't have no books to read other than the Scrolls right what do you think about it listen what do we got brother 96 in his final thank God for the truth that we can read the Bible for ourselves and I begin to arrive and it's my mind think about it the same Gods it was back there it's the same God that walks ashore to Galilee the same God they come down Through the Ages and we'll get into without worse the glory of its person we'll see the background from all the way coming down I hear the call do you he's Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday a day and forever they were shut out in the woods foreign what about it he was wrong I don't ever spoke to your heart or revelation what's the difference in speaking to a prophet and speaking to you oh yeah with the same God lays the same one it spoken the prophet is the same one and speak to you I feel the poor I hear the calls I know his spirit's moving thank you for the word that you've given unto us the time that they've had together and I pray that you would just continue to open your word to reveal yourself for 15 years things has been unfolding and it'll never stop amen we love you father we thank you in Jesus name amen and amen amen think about him he speaks to me you've heard me tell about the time we were going to have to discuss marriage and divorce with a theologian in a ministered meeting and I'd always prayed about that scripture in Deuteronomy and where it says of you know a woman make Obi another man's wife you know and I'd always wondered well why does it say it like that I had no answer but I for some reason I had to burying the sitting in the corner right over there that's praying we come up on Friday night we were leaving Saturday to go to the meeting and uh I don't know you know I know the Lord was telling me that what is going to be brought up but and have no way of knowing and he dropped down and answered me that that night and he said that doesn't mean that I'm okay and for her to do it that just means she will go do it right so don't give her a ride don't don't do that I said because of the rest of the scripture where he can't take her back well then I had the scripture to answer my point you know because why couldn't he take her back if she's free and that when we got there that was the question well you know I felt pretty good oh brother said that night up there he said I hate for a man to ask the question when he's the only one in the building had the answer well I'm not bragging I just the answer was there and once the Theologian made his charges I just answered from the scriptures I said now let you Theologian verify whether it's okay for her to remarry or not he wouldn't do it I said he won't move but there's one thing about it this tape will verify it you get up and tell me I'm wrong come on I should eat of that or you shake your head he finally shook his head because see he knew he couldn't argue with that scripture because it did not say it was okay for her to do that that's what we read well see there you don't have no fear you understand when God reveals something to you I mean are you afraid of somebody coming along and convince you that water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is wrong well if you do you got a problem you know somebody come along and take the the Bible and prove there's three gods you got a problem if you don't have a revelation if you've got a revelation you don't worry do you because you'd already give you the answer I love it that way Lord Jesus we thank you for tonight we pray that what we've done has been what you wanted just kind of what we felt like doing Lord I pray that as we kind of move now out of the garden and get on into other things that Lord that you would come and speak to our hearts as we go along the way and guide each one of us be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey and let your loving grace be with each one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Jesus the light of the world person
