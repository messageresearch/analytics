========================================

the world Listen The Whole World's waiting on somebody to live those virtues whether they know it or not whether they're the most ranked Christian I mean rank Center in the world they want somebody to be different they want somebody to say thank you please remember what would come about when we first started this even in our human life we should make this world better you know I just started by going through Walmart like you're talking about you know I go through Walmart and they start playing on the floor I think if I put it back up I'm trying to make it better than when I left it well you know what somebody may see that right you never know somebody may see that and then say well there goes the Christian or there goes somebody that really cares you may never know that but hey at least you didn't walk by and do like most and kick the thing out of the way I don't this is the state for me the worst part of of this whole thing is the regrets I have of people seeing and knowing things that I was supposed to be a Christian friend there's really nothing you can do about a bag of feathers you can't go get it yourself I have more right the best thing you can do is right there right not give them another excuse to think the same thing let me leave you with that don't give them an excuse to think the same thing go way out of your way the other way to make sure they go violated yeah you may be right on the borderline well you don't want to be on a borderline isn't that where we should react to God that's correct yes make it right right then you know Brothers Satan had a podcast yeah um um yeah okay thank you foreign foreign okay all right all right brother Royal Soriano is out of the hospital he is home now okay all right thank you Lord he's not out of the woods though still facing open heart surgery when they can get all these other things set them down in his body so so just keep him in prayers he's not out like I said no I would get Plus for those of you that don't

our website there's a link that goes to his he's got a page set up for brother Korean open so donate that's the next thing facing him because he's going to be you know thousands of dollars in debt when he gets started so just keep them in your prayers Lord to take care of all those things yeah never seen his righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread so so he will welcome I told the told somebody the other day maybe this was the Lord telling him to slow down because your body can only take so much to tell him to slow down because he goes all the time so let's keep him in our prayers in our daily prayers you know we hadn't heard a thing about the I know there's thousands dead now so they said it was the worst storm I've ever hit land yeah so we haven't heard and then I looked on the in the paper this morning and uh they said all of their media Outlets were down so there's really no way to um to get in and find out but there are a lot of message Believers there a lot of our churches there yes it was over 10 000 because I said it was in the clouds so the beginning of Sorrows well I don't know if your brother coming right then and he was screaming you know right right or whatever I don't know if he was 300 miles okay all right so we're on the Lord's time now all right turn to let's go to Peter and let's read that we haven't been reading it let's read Saint Peter we've been on the Statue of perfect man now 28 Parts here and we're on almost the temperance yeah we're on Temperance here and I want us to now remember we're going to read today for brother Ram said that's not quitting drinking that's your ungodly temper so anyway let's read this Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus Christ it's on but I don't have one thing on I'm fine we're okay Simon Peter servant the Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious face or something that we obtain we've already been through all that something we obtained and um we were standing outside and I'll tell him because he'll be he'll be watching the guy across the street brother Buster he's watching this series so okay okay come up on his golf cart and he said I'm sure I'm enjoying I said I've been wondering about the second perfect man he said I like the way you draw that chart but if you're listening or watching in that it's not my idea that comes from Brother Brown that didn't come from me we wasn't smart enough to do that but he is watching in so we're gonna we're gonna really you know dig down and and see how that this is going to have to be it's a requirement the model required these virtues brother Brown said it was a requirement so Peter didn't just put it in the Bible to fill up his face these are requirements these are things to be a perfect man we must have these verses all right and like Roselle was talking about Wednesday night which is so true to get to seal of God in your forehead this is the city of God in your forehead this is the Seal of God in your heart everybody do you understand that we need to know if you didn't that's just about the simplest way in your plant this is a seal of God in your heart baptism of the Holy Ghost got it in yourself okay this is the Seal of God in your forehead which is not it's not all this but it's all this combined this is the synagogue in your forehead around here this is the statue of a perfect man or it is the Apex or the Seal of God has never been in an individual except for I say Jesus Christ from William Brandon because those are the only two that's reached adoption on the earth so they come to a full stature where the Capstone comes down and they have the fully revealed word all right so that's what brother Dan was talking about that's why it says the Seal of God in their forehead all right and uh I'm sure he'll expound on that much more so let's read this though so to get that seal of God to make that scripture come to pass and by what look at me to make that scripture come to pass you've got to have these virtues working in your life because you won't have the seal the guy in your forehead without those virtues working in your life God's not going to seal in something that's going to break over here or break over here right all right he's not going to seal that in he's going to seal it in when you become a complete package or a complete stature of a perfect man how do we get perfected fivefold Mastery you're going to hear it today all right they have light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God you're there knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according against his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness so what we're talking about here in the Statue of perfect man we're talking about natural life and godliness the natural life we live is affected by that and the life we live with God should be together but remember we live a natural life and we live a spiritual life everybody understand that say amen amen you don't you don't realize that you're in bad shape all right so we realize that all right whereby are given unto us exceeding exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust besides this in other words besides this receiving of the new birth all right and to your faith and what I've always told you add to what you believe you can't add something that you don't believe sure you're looking unto something but you got to believe that God's going to give you virtue you got to believe that but you can't be like a lot of people like long now we're talking coming home yesterday we're talking about the third pull and the third pull ties into this but the third pull is a manifestation of the word but it's not something that we're gonna everybody's saying oh when it comes oh when it comes but when it comes and you ain't got it here you're not going to understand it there at that spot we got to have it now see we can't just one day say well oh one day we're going to be a perfect man there's someday in your journey you got to start that and then you got to work your way up to it all right you can't say oh when that third pull comes into manifestation it is to somebody but it's gonna it's going to be in manifest manifestation of somebody that can handle it power without yeah power without character is satanic but Power with character the prophet said it's fit to rule all right so here we go the third pull is is very dangerous very dangerous if you have it and you don't have character you can zap your boss out of existence you know if you're having a bad day you see God's not going to give you that that's right you got to have the character first and then the third pull is just going to be a manifestation it's going to be a happening of what you already have so we can't say well the statue of perfect man's to somebody else or it's to somebody that's here or somebody who's to you if you have the new birth you are in that pyramid City because all with a new birth is going to be in the city right right all right so if you got the new birth you're in the city but there are things in that city that you can have like I told you before my illustration with a pill the pill is wonderful the pill is great the pill has everything inside of it that you need but it's got a coating around it you got to take that pill put it in the environment then what's inside that pill is going to do you good so what you got to do is just do just like we were talking about the other day you got to make yourself available for God to be able to reveal these things to you all right I can't reveal one thing to you brother today I'm going to Claude nobody can reveal anything to you we can spark your interest open your eyes or or brother Brown said knock the scales back so that you and God can talk to each other that's why as message people we become we've become Catholic brother Dale go get it for us and we'll just believe what you say that's Catholic priest go get it for us you intercede sure he's an intercessor but he's not the intercessor he's a brother Branham absolutely yes ma'am absolutely sister you're exactly correct brother Brown is not he was he sure he was interceding for the people that Moses did but it was Christ in brother Branham interceding for the people sure sure but brother Branham is not my stand between between me and God that's right there's only one the Bible says amen intercessor between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus now if we preach Jesus Christ see then that's where Jesus can come down question the the out the third pole the opening of the word which brings us to that place where we can change exactly because the Capstone has to come down on brother Brown says that the city comes down on a redeemed entire Earth so that's the way the city is is the way you and I are we're going to have to be ready for this thing to come down on us everybody got that that's what we're talking about the Seal of God in the forehead see where it says holy spirit that seals brother Brown we'll get to it one of these days we'll get up that high where he said it seals all these virtues in then God has a moving breathing stature of a perfect man which is himself this is all that God's working that's correct what do I play you make yourself available okay you cannot manufacture any of that run around we'll we we probably have already skipped through it but he talks about the peacock feathers and the and the crow what's going to happen is what's going to happen is the same way with me and you because it's happened to me remember I've told you many times before about Temperance and and the things that that I used to have a temper and I used to be able to spot off at the mouth and just you know cut you to pieces with my with my mouth but then I came up one day and and I was on the phone with a friend of mine and I said the word s-h-i-t many times sorry and it was free and it just flowed and it just did it just happened and I was talking to him and the word AWS all those things that we always said before well you know you still got the human mind but God said he remember him said God's obligated to help you because you can't help yourself like you said you can't help yourself I was on the phone with him and I was going to say those words just as plain and I've been a Christian for just a year or two maybe still in my you know young journey and I was on the phone with Ken and I we were having a conversation and I was going through and I just when I come to those words that came into my brain brother Danny before they got to here it was like something took its fist I was driving down the road called something hit me right here and just knock the breath out of it so I couldn't say it see God was saying that's where God's going to show you hey that's over hey that's over I'm not going to slip up and say that anymore God's going to protect me because he knows I used to say those things to people and it really hurt them and I don't want to do that anymore see God knows that desire in you if you say well I can't do nothing about my temper I'm not going to do anything about my temper you know what you've done you've just cut God off you've cut the preacher off you cut the word off you said I can't do nothing about my temper well you know what you're going to keep your temper and you're going to stay right there at 10 person you're not going any further right yes it's like just like Kane and that's what's coming up take it early what you're doing you're saying God I can't well now you can say you can say God I can't do nothing about it you can say that but when you say I ain't gonna do anything about it you cut yourself off God can't help you he will not override your free moral agency your Primal agency doesn't finish or end at the new birth that's right right you're a free moral agent to the time you passed away or your body's changed your Primal agent but as far as the rapture the ride as far as the bride um do you have to be the full statue no your bride as soon as you're born again as soon as you're born as soon as you get the new birth that puts you in the body totally inside that's correct but now there's one thing that will happen you'll never go huh you'll never go on with God any further there'll be a lot of promises that God will not keep and doesn't have to keep listen you understand what I'm saying no there's promises that God has for people that goes on up further that he don't have to keep if you say I'm just born again and then you just go lay down on the bed I know you don't I know you know I know you don't but I'm just for others for other people you know it's not like if you're born again you're just as Eternal as God is in your soul but God's still working on that outside guy but he's not gonna remember what I said Power without character satanic that doesn't mean you're of Satan it means that you will use it wrong and he's not going to give it to you just like the car keys my son was my son when he was born but now at five years old I didn't have any parking but he was my son Josh was my son read in the Bible the Bible a son is always a son charm what son was born into the body son and daughter born into the body of God you've got all the promises of God but God doesn't give you the keys to the Statue of a perfect man and just say here take off no you have to grow the Bible says in what Grace and knowledge being born again okay go ahead the Holy Spirit at the top he said is that's what Seals Everything in that's what makes everything work correctly a seal of God is in your forehead that's what the Bible says it's your knowledge it's nothing to say is it is it like like yeah that means you can understand more okay you understand more of God but what as we get further I'll explain it to you more because brother Ryan explains it very well he says see you get all the way up here and temperatures one of them he'll tell you you get right up here and you may fall off well that doesn't mean you fall from eternal life that just means that something in your temperance that you can't handle or you won't let God handle you people know as well as I do there are certain things in your life in my life that we like I'm talking about yourself there's certain things in yourself yes come on people there's certain things in ourselves that we're like that's just me well you know I said to me it's a cop-out if it's wrong that's right right that's right I mean I'm not gonna sit down next Sunday and say I'm not gonna say anything anymore that was not your why I heard that was another one with a straight face yeah I just want everybody to know you know outside when you giggle your hair balances I'm up here just shoot at me but no there's things in our life that we are that is molded into our character that we can't do anything about but we can take that and let God use it for the glory of God see like me I like to talk and that when I was out in the world I talked about things that were horrible that were not good I used the words out of my mouth to destroy people with well now I hope and pray that God takes that same characteristic molds it into this and lets me have knowledge have Temperance have patience with the people that's what brother Brown said you have patience you have patience see okay and I fall and I fall on a lot of these things but there are certain times that you've got to say hey God I know I got a temple and I want you to get rid of it for me not me trying to get rid of it because remember we're not reformers right Freda we're not trying to reform people we're trying to transform because she when Jesus walked on the earth he drove people out of the Temple he had a small temper the Bible says Don't Let the Sun Go Down your wrath it doesn't say don't have don't have anger he just said Don't Let the Sun Go Down you got to have a temper you're right you've got to have a certain amount of people but let me tell you that's correct if you ask God to get ready get in your temper he's going to sing you situation that's how you grow well see that's what's going to happen just be ready what's going to happen is is God's gonna test you and try you remember he tests and tries all his children he don't test the devil's kids he knows what they're going to do he tests his own children now look not for his good because the more I think about that that day when I was driving down the road and I hear people people struggling about you know things in their life that they used to do and that God helped me get through that because he knew I didn't want to ever do that again I don't want to ever say a bad word I don't ever say a bad word in my life I don't even want to say somebody says well I let one slip no I'm a witness that if you put your mind to it mine you put your mind to it and you say God I don't want to ever say another bad word even if Satan comes in and brings a thought I mean it was just like somebody went punched me right here and my breath went and Ken said what happened and I started to say well you wouldn't understand but I went ahead and explained it to him because he knew what kind of life I'd lived before you know we were we were friends of course he just kind of chuckled and laughed but that's okay that's fine but God wouldn't let me say those words they were coming out they were coming I was getting ready to say them and it's like it's just like somebody pushed me right here and all the air went out of my went out of my mouth and it was just like and that was it but you know what that got me through that and I know thou then that I can testify that if you have had a bad temper mouth whatever God can take care of it if you'll ask him that's right he knows your heart that's what I mean he knows what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of remember doors and doors brother Brown said even though you let God in the door of your heart there's still this door here this door here this door here and you know what brother Branham said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he will not go in there unless you ask him to go in all right see he didn't make these little illustrations just for fun he when he said the Holy Ghost was timid the Holy Ghost was a gentleman well that's what he wasn't meaning by this the Holy Ghost is not going to pour these virtues on you sure he's sitting there waiting he's waiting to pour these things out on you but he's waiting on you to say hey I want that door open and I want that part of my life cleaned out you know we all got those things but as we go with this statue of a perfect man maybe what we're trying to do is it just make us aware that we need virtue we need knowledge we must have that to survive to the Christians especially in this world because you know what we got two hundred thousand thousand demons that's trying to get us to slip up that's what they're given for right to drive us back to the Homeland what's the Homeland it's got you a perfect man to me that is the city that comes down and we're part of that City she had her hand up firsthand too well my question was on this reader at three we have a lot of people who believe in about choice but they don't go on that's right correct what about those people maybe they never really got born again if you're born again you have a new life in you and it will pull you toward right but what she's saying is they truly believe and see you don't how you know that no no no you got to remember if they truly believe they're going with God if it's just a natural human belief they never got the new birth you can't have the new birth and set home exactly you can't have the new birth and then go do the same things you used today you can't do it no way your fruits will show what you got or not that's right if you got the new birth then you are changed right just like me those words still came into my brain and when I didn't have the Holy Ghost I had that blackness in me which should go ahead and say it there was no filter there I just went ahead and he just came right on out just as easy as me talking to you now but when you come down and there's a stopper in there brother Brown said the Holy Ghost will check you right he said he'll you'll feel that little I should have done that well now we're human we do those things but you know what with Temperance we're not we're gonna may not get into all of it today but in Temperance we all have a certain amount of temper we all have a certain amount of switches that controls that temper you know some people said well I can I can tolerate this and I can't tolerate this well this is what you got to work on then don't work on what you can tolerate well that's just human Toleration right but you work on this over here the rough part that's the rough part you got to work on and work on it you mean pray about it absolutely we'll have to catch it real quick next time you make yourself there you know there's not a um I got in trouble one time for saying message 101 but there is a well I mean that's just the simple part baptized name Jesus Christ there's no eternal hell uh you know there's only one God and you know you need to go to church you need to read your Bible That's message 101. that gets you started but if you don't do message 101 are you born again no you're not even in school yet well I mean even if you it's not a desire if you just keep doing it I have found that it becomes a desire yes I keep doing the one-on-one yeah sure wait what that has to be is when you come to Faith that's the new birth that's the baby form now your baby form not God but nothing I ever made it for me I understand everybody knows that but it's your baby form you have it in a baby form you must feed it to nurture it remember what brother Brown said the the old uh the old Indian said when me born again may have now white dog and black dog well see remember he had black dog to start with when he got bored again he got the white gold so now there's two in there fighting it's not too in the soul you understand what I mean it's that it's New Soul not new as far as you understand we know that it's not too sold or killing One Soul it's this soul with the nature change well you still got a nature of Hamish nature still got the nature of safety sorry you did brother Brown said we were born between Satan and Eve so we have an adamic nature that we have to get rid of and it keeps what brother Brown said this is going to be sticky until the day weekend out again so you're fighting this thing where brother rounds says the old Indian said me now have white dog black dog and you don't remember the guy said well which one wins he said the one I feed the most that's right the one I feed the most so if you feed the white dog you gotta come to church you gotta study you gotta read your Bible do the little simple things of God all right then you will see a result to me that's the results right growing in Grace and knowledge to me the Statue of perfect man those virtues are the result but now I'm telling you a lot of times I'm telling all of you you see somebody comes in here and they get baptized and they and they they lock a house on fire daddy said on a windy day most of the time about six months later they'll burn out and go home well they never got the new birth because the new birth will never do that and God's not an Indian giver he won't give it to you and knowing you're going to lose it if you get the new birth you're gonna start you might not hit first you're going to stumble and follow your child that's right but you're going to gravitate towards the things of God because surely we gravitated toward the things of the world before we started but now if we and even if we are still doing some of the things of the world you understand what I'm saying yes there's a check there there's something that's saying you're guilty of that yes and you feel you feel bad to me I felt bad even though I didn't say that I felt bad but then I then I was crying actually going down the road saying well thank you God I know that part's over with all right say and I won't have to worry about that again because if God will ever check you one time he'll check you the second time with her whatever he'll keep you from that now there's a lot of those things I need but that one thing I'm sure you're not going to say well I slipped up and said a bad word the other day no I don't I don't agree with that but tech support and you got on your side I'm too blessed to be stressed so when you pick up the phone you're so Grandma will answer the phone and so you start you listen to the person talking what's going on because I'm not going to get angry I'm going this is what I have to say I need to listen when you're listening so wait a minute please uh you called me for a problem once you decide if you have a problem call me back thank you hang up your phone and then you start talking to God you know
