[0:54] opportunity that we can come to you and

[0:59] believe that you you Lord will speak to
[1:01] each one of our hearts and lives and

[1:19] by thine understanding hand and keep us
[1:22] Lord and as we read your word you come
[1:24] and you speak to our hearts in Jesus
[1:26] name
[1:28] amen Ephesians 1 we've been
[1:36] reading verse three blessed be the God
[1:38] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:40] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:42] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:46] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:49] before the foundation of the world that
[1:51] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:52] before him in love now remember he chose
[1:55] us that's it all right so just keep that
[1:57] in mind cuz that's what we're still on
[1:59] all right having predestinated us unto
[2:02] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[2:04] to himself according to the good
[2:06] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[2:08] the glory of his grace wherein he hath
[2:10] made us accepted in the Beloved and whom
[2:13] we have Redemption through his blood the
[2:15] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[2:18] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[2:20] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[2:22] Prudence having made known unto us the
[2:24] mystery of his will according to his
[2:27] good pleasure which he ha purposed in
[2:29] himself
[2:30] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[2:32] of times he might gather together in one
[2:35] all things in Christ both which are in
[2:38] heaven and which are on earth even in
[2:40] him now keep that in mind is to be
[2:43] gathered in him to be gathered into one
[2:47] amen now this is a many membered body of
[2:50] Christ but remember we're
[2:53] one all right keep that in mind and then
[2:56] it will help us to understand in whom
[2:59] also we have obtained an inheritance
[3:01] being we have obtained an inheritance
[3:04] being predestinated according to the
[3:05] purpose of him who worketh all things
[3:08] after the counsel of his own will that
[3:10] we should be to the praise of his glory
[3:13] who first trusted in Christ now let's go
[3:16] back and we'll read from John verse
[3:20] chapter
[3:22] 14 we'll begin reading verse
[3:26] 16 and I will pray the father and he
[3:28] shall give you a another comforter that
[3:31] he may abide with you forever even the
[3:34] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[3:36] receive because it seeth him not neither
[3:39] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[3:41] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[3:44] will not leave you comfortless I will
[3:46] come to you yet a little while and the
[3:48] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[3:51] because I live ye shall live also at
[3:54] that day now the prophet said that's
[3:56] this day okay so at this day
[4:00] ye shall
[4:02] know that I am in my
[4:05] father and ye in me and I in you you may
[4:10] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[4:13] the reading of the word as always say we
[4:15] can look back and we can see and say
[4:17] well I believe that he was in the
[4:23] father
[4:25] okay I'm put it in back
[4:30] the paper will be laying in the back
[4:32] back there wait it to for you to do
[4:34] because people will be getting them and
[4:38] you make sure and get it to be right
[4:39] there where the priority Quest or things
[4:41] is at all right but as I said now it's
[4:44] easy to be able to in this day to
[4:48] comprehend and believing in one true and
[4:51] living God that we can say that I in my
[4:55] father all right and then the it's easy
[5:00] to say it I in you because you know by
[5:04] the new birth it can be I in you all
[5:09] right we see he was in the father then
[5:11] we can see now he's dwelling in us but
[5:14] what about ye in
[5:16] me ye in me now that's uh a little
[5:21] different to what we we think about you
[5:24] know what we're trying to consider but
[5:26] we've been on the word predestination
[5:30] and you know trying to cover uh some
[5:33] things of
[5:35] predestination and uh
[5:38] seeing that we've come down this is
[5:40] about the 12th message then we've come
[5:44] down to begin to talk
[5:48] about a possibility or a
[5:53] probability of us having
[5:57] existence before the world
[6:00] all right and uh we say oh no we didn't
[6:03] we didn't exist we W this that well
[6:06] there's a lot in the Bible and a lot in
[6:08] the prophet's message it talks about it
[6:10] so by that we can uh go back and see
[6:14] those things but now remember one thing
[6:18] please we are not talking about bodies
[6:22] you know human being bodies mortal
[6:26] beings now that's a Mormon Doctrine of
[6:30] pre-existence that's right all right and
[6:33] we don't believe in that we don't
[6:34] believe in the existence of human beings
[6:38] before the world right all right now and
[6:41] in being that then we don't believe in
[6:44] uh perverted bodies perverted Spirits
[6:48] perverted Souls Lost you know Etc we
[6:53] don't believe that was back there before
[6:55] the world see and that's what everybody
[6:57] wants to go to because you watch their
[7:01] doctrines and and I've watched this
[7:03] closely over the years of of the the
[7:06] time being in the message and you get
[7:09] all of these seed doctrines and and
[7:11] ideas and and two souls and and all of
[7:15] the different things like that and and
[7:18] it'll always lead right out into where
[7:20] the F the um beginner of that message or
[7:25] whatever winds up into uh some form of
[7:30] polygamy that's right or or adultery you
[7:34] know or whatever then you can see that
[7:38] man is looking back at his flesh and
[7:41] trying to make something out of that
[7:44] that's right yep and uh you can do all
[7:47] you want to you can go down and you can
[7:50] get that face lift and Tommy tucked and
[7:54] and everything build up and do all you
[7:56] want to and I'm not saying nothing about
[7:59] it I'm just saying my point you can do
[8:01] every B of that and you can take your
[8:04] little peel bottles and claim you're all
[8:06] Soul filled as you did when you was 20
[8:09] and you can talk all you want to but
[8:12] you're just looking in the mirror
[8:14] messing things up you know just go ahead
[8:18] and say hey I'm getting old and I'm
[8:22] enjoying this it's what I told him last
[8:24] night about at the fellowship meeting I
[8:26] was talking to this brother outside and
[8:27] he said you know he said I had seen you
[8:30] which we didn't we were missing the the
[8:32] last couple of Fellowship meetings you
[8:33] know one because we were out in in
[8:35] Kansas preaching and one because of the
[8:37] snow and things so the brother said I I
[8:39] haven't seen you in a long time I said
[8:41] yeah that's right brother we need to
[8:43] start seeing each other more I said
[8:46] because you know the older we're all
[8:48] getting is we're getting to where we
[8:50] can't remember who people are and I said
[8:53] first is you can't remember who other
[8:55] people are then you get where you can't
[8:57] remember who you are you know and all
[9:00] like that so you can do all you want to
[9:02] to take your younger and live out of
[9:04] your peel bottles and do what You' p and
[9:06] and take all of your herbal tonics and
[9:08] all that's good amen right but just
[9:13] remember you're getting older that's
[9:15] right you're going back to the ground
[9:17] that you come from so don't never think
[9:20] that this body here will will touch just
[9:23] a man thing today of when we're talking
[9:26] about it on the body and and you know
[9:30] just kind of drop it in and leave it for
[9:32] later on and all
[9:34] because in the word
[9:37] redeem now I gave you these Wednesday
[9:39] but I gave them back today to where we
[9:42] could look at it and uh the word
[9:46] redeem
[9:48] see it means that to be brought
[9:53] back all
[9:55] right it means to bring back yep all
[10:00] right it means to be brought back from
[10:03] where you once was right all right now
[10:06] I'm reading what brother Brandman say
[10:08] scanning down over the things and you've
[10:10] got them 1 2 3 4 uh of your
[10:13] notes it means to go
[10:16] back to redeem anything is to bring it
[10:19] back to its
[10:21] original
[10:23] place all right so
[10:26] now if we're looking at a human mortal
[10:29] and things like
[10:30] that we're to have enough common sense
[10:33] as I was trying to express to be able to
[10:36] realize
[10:38] that these bodies are not
[10:41] Eternal right all right so then we're
[10:46] trying our best to get it to a place to
[10:48] where not as everybody keeps saying you
[10:50] know I'm going to get me a new body and
[10:52] then the people this message see they
[10:54] kind of leave it dangling because
[10:56] they'll say we're going to get a new
[10:57] body but then you question them and
[11:00] they'll run backwards because they don't
[11:02] want to really Express what they're
[11:05] meaning by it and see you know you say
[11:08] well brother I believe in this body here
[11:11] being made new and oh yeah that's what
[11:13] I'm talking about
[11:16] well I don't think that's what they're
[11:18] talking about before then but that's all
[11:21] right that's their business but I don't
[11:23] believe that your body was ever Eternal
[11:26] right right see now we'll show where was
[11:29] at when the prophet covers it in a
[11:32] little while in the message you know but
[11:35] that body is not Eternal but one day
[11:38] we'll be made Eternal because we're not
[11:40] going to get a new body it's this body
[11:43] made new or made Eternal am right all
[11:46] right see then that way you know it will
[11:50] catch up with us at a time all right see
[11:52] then I don't believe that your spirit
[11:55] part of you or that Satan can tempt and
[11:58] work with us and do things like that I I
[12:01] don't believe that's Eternal right you
[12:04] know and and I believe it's still in a
[12:06] condition of God working on it but it's
[12:09] not Eternal right now but see the Soul
[12:14] by the new birth is eternal amen all
[12:17] right now in that then we can talk about
[12:20] redeemed then but not talk about redeem
[12:24] in the the bases of the body and not
[12:28] talk talk about redeem in the bases of
[12:31] our spirit right part but we can talk
[12:34] about redeem in the bases of the Soul
[12:37] right all right because now that way we
[12:40] can see it
[12:42] better and uh that's what we were trying
[12:44] to get across our Wednesday of how that
[12:47] the word redeem it means to go
[12:51] back see to where you come from right
[12:55] all right now so then as far as our body
[12:59] IES can go we'll read it in a minute the
[13:02] prophet said they was in this world y
[13:04] That's Right CU I I tried to tell you
[13:08] that and tried to prove it over and over
[13:10] throughout many many messages where the
[13:13] Prophet we even put a couple there where
[13:15] he had the question you know if you have
[13:17] eternal life right the eternal life you
[13:20] have always was eternal am but there was
[13:23] a time we didn't have
[13:25] that and see this plain common this one
[13:28] little simple illustration should make
[13:31] every one of us consider if if brother
[13:34] brandom is saying that we came into the
[13:36] world with eternal life well he said
[13:40] it I believe that you
[13:43] know right but he he's always saying in
[13:47] the same message the future home where
[13:49] he said you come into the world with
[13:50] eternal life you always was eternal you
[13:52] wouldn't saved on no certain day he uses
[13:55] that statement if you have eternal life
[13:57] that's right you always was eternal all
[14:00] right now because if you have eternal
[14:05] life now then why do you talk about
[14:09] Redemption
[14:11] right what's the purpose amen right you
[14:15] know amen and you would have an eternal
[14:19] sinner right see but everybody wants to
[14:22] to do something with a seed you
[14:25] know well well that's all right because
[14:28] we've been through it and through it the
[14:31] prophet covers about being born with a
[14:33] seed in you but then he covers that as
[14:36] being what your representation of predes
[14:39] from predestination or to
[14:41] predestination right or far whatever you
[14:44] know it's it's not something that you
[14:47] said but I come into the world with this
[14:48] little spot in me what are you trying to
[14:53] say right you're doing away with
[14:56] salvation
[14:59] just shoot the people everybody goes to
[15:02] heaven y that's what I told him with the
[15:05] two
[15:07] Souls that's what I told the people that
[15:09] was teaching the two Souls that's 40
[15:11] years ago I said all we need to do is do
[15:14] like the Church of Christ man said you
[15:17] baptized people I told him I've told you
[15:19] before I talked to one I said I'll meet
[15:20] you on Lake ler we'll fill up the
[15:22] kingdom is Sunday if all it takes is
[15:25] water baptism
[15:27] right we'll just go out to there and
[15:30] everybody that's there don't matter they
[15:31] got bikinis what they got we just put
[15:33] them in the
[15:36] water well he well you
[15:39] know I said of course we're going to do
[15:41] it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:43] Christ oh
[15:45] no it's Father Son and Holy
[15:49] Ghost I said you Church of Christ get
[15:51] you baptized correctly right but you see
[15:54] we try to put something there and that's
[15:57] what I told the two so
[16:00] people I said if you was born with
[16:03] eternal
[16:05] life and the devil in there together my
[16:07] Bible says God won't dwell in an unclean
[16:10] vessel I said where you at right I said
[16:13] all we need to do is just kill the
[16:17] person well they didn't like that
[16:21] right you they didn't like the ideas
[16:24] that I had a lot of people don't like
[16:26] the ideas I've got you know you said
[16:30] well we got laws for this I I've told
[16:33] you what I believe some man goes out and
[16:34] rapes a young girl or or a baby or
[16:37] something like that just casorate the
[16:38] sucker you'll take care of the rest of
[16:40] his life put him in jail and leave him
[16:42] there that's right people don't like
[16:45] that but that's plain
[16:48] language and they don't like for you to
[16:50] talk like that but it's
[16:52] true and I believe in the gospel like
[16:55] brother said last night it's about time
[16:56] to start doing things you know I think
[16:59] it is it's about time to say it like it
[17:01] is and forget it you know people don't
[17:04] like it don't worry about it they ain't
[17:05] going to educate me none and they ain't
[17:07] going to pay me
[17:09] nothing no ain't going to worry about it
[17:11] but you see I believe in being able to
[17:16] redeem back to where you came from right
[17:20] amen right but if you redeem too
[17:23] far you're going to redeem yourself out
[17:25] of existence
[17:29] and that was not the
[17:31] plan God's plan was to have children
[17:35] that's right his
[17:38] offspring y but he was going to bring
[17:41] them in a basis to where that he could
[17:43] display himself and I'll get to it more
[17:46] this evening he could display himself as
[17:48] a
[17:50] father amen you know if he was a father
[17:53] we we l real good on the Healer part
[17:55] right that he's a Healer savior Etc but
[17:58] what about laying the emphasis on that
[17:59] he's a father well if he's a father he's
[18:01] got have children am that's right does
[18:05] that need a big light book turned on you
[18:07] know right does that mean something I
[18:10] got to do something to make you really
[18:11] think about it a father means he's what
[18:14] he got children
[18:17] right me and my wife got married I
[18:20] wasn't a father I was just a
[18:22] husband you took my wife to bring in to
[18:25] the point of being a
[18:27] father well see it actually the way God
[18:30] wanted to be a father it took the fall
[18:34] right to bring it into condition right
[18:38] that he could be the the father he
[18:39] wanted to be right he created Adam as we
[18:43] covered the other day sure gave him
[18:46] eternal life in his soul right but his
[18:49] body and his Spirit wasn't Eternal
[18:51] that's right but he was looking at
[18:53] something that he was wanting to take
[18:55] place in the whole human
[18:57] race but still of that we sin in my
[19:01] pasty but see then if we can see the
[19:04] part of
[19:07] redeem then I'm like this you say but
[19:10] but you're walking on thin eyes Brother
[19:11] D to walk back and do the way you do or
[19:14] you know as long as I can say what the
[19:16] Bible says and what the prophet says I
[19:19] don't worry about the thin I right I'd
[19:21] he rather be out on the thin I and be
[19:23] standing on the bank saying we can't do
[19:26] it we can't do it you know I just don't
[19:29] want to get confused I don't want to get
[19:32] all tied up in
[19:34] doctrines we'll read one in a minute
[19:36] where the Prophet said this is the
[19:37] oldest Doctrine that's ever been he said
[19:40] this not a new doctrine the oldest one
[19:42] that's ever been what the Plan of
[19:45] Redemption all right but you see there's
[19:48] no way to do it and I've got one in here
[19:50] get to it in a minute where the prophet
[19:51] of God said God didn't come to redeem
[19:54] the devil's children that's right amen
[19:58] he come to redeem his
[20:02] children see then what are we we was
[20:05] born I
[20:08] thought now that we were born kin folks
[20:12] to the devil
[20:14] right I thought he was the closest King
[20:17] in the Book of Ruth
[20:19] right I thought that was
[20:22] Bible but yet we don't want the Bible we
[20:25] just want something to tell us how to
[20:27] make us feel good and just
[20:29] well that's
[20:32] wonderful but remember feeling good you
[20:34] won't face the devil with it either you
[20:36] can shout around the devil all you want
[20:38] to and he just laugh at you that's right
[20:40] am he ain't going to move but he going
[20:42] to move when the word comes cuz that's
[20:44] the one thing he can't handle that's
[20:46] right all right now so then get what
[20:48] we're talking
[20:50] about if we talk about
[20:53] redeemed and redeem being able to go
[20:56] back
[20:59] to a place position condition whatever
[21:01] you want to make it make it is to be
[21:04] able to go back to a
[21:07] place
[21:09] where you came
[21:12] from all right now we covered last week
[21:17] or this past
[21:19] Wednesday the point and I gave it back
[21:22] to you where we we'd have
[21:24] it on the uh number five of you notes
[21:28] that brother randam was talking about
[21:31] and who is this
[21:34] mzd that Jesus Christ the son of God now
[21:38] not Jesus the
[21:40] flesh Jesus Christ the son of God the
[21:44] Christ the anointing the Loos the
[21:46] theophany the the all in all came in a
[21:50] word formed
[21:54] body stood there in that body and was
[21:57] able to create the world Etc the many
[22:00] things it was brought into being all
[22:03] right in a word form are IM morphe
[22:07] body
[22:09] okay but he said we bypass
[22:12] that to come straight to the Earth
[22:15] that's paragraph 67 who just melt
[22:18] Jes we came straight to the Earth to be
[22:21] tempted by sin
[22:23] amen all right now so we never came like
[22:27] he did
[22:29] no all right see we didn't come in that
[22:34] word formed body right now I kept trying
[22:37] to say that Wednesday and I hope you get
[22:40] it and then you can see how we
[22:43] came all right
[22:47] now he came in that word form he stood
[22:50] there in a body y you said what kind of
[22:53] a body was it no it wasn't 16 elements
[22:56] it was better The Prophet it one time
[23:01] y he said a better hand a better eye
[23:04] better ears better than what we are he
[23:08] stood there in a
[23:10] theophany word formed
[23:14] body all right but he said we bypass
[23:17] that that's right and we become that
[23:20] here upon the Earth we become the word
[23:23] here all right but here's the way people
[23:25] preach it and that's what I told you
[23:27] that they're not saying it correctly you
[23:30] read what the prophet
[23:32] says people are say see there we byass
[23:35] the
[23:37] word well then brother brandham said if
[23:41] you wasn't part of the word before the
[23:44] world you never will be amen so now what
[23:48] are you
[23:51] saying well I don't know I just believe
[23:53] we byass the word see now you won't
[23:56] answer me and one thing about this old
[23:58] boy you look at I tell you what I
[24:00] believe I don't play around I don't try
[24:02] to trick you into anything I don't tell
[24:05] you I'll try to tell you both sides of
[24:07] it and at least you know what I believe
[24:10] but about 90% of the preachers in this
[24:12] message you'll never get them to tell
[24:14] you what they believe they'll Bice every
[24:17] way they can to get around it but then
[24:19] let say we don't believe like you yeah
[24:22] my wife and I talking today coming up in
[24:24] other words if you tell me so now
[24:26] brother Dale
[24:28] you may not agree with me about what I
[24:30] believe it means exactly that you you
[24:32] got some idea right you got a concept
[24:36] that you know I don't believe or you
[24:38] wouldn't be making that statement
[24:40] right right right but see why don't
[24:44] people just tell what to believe right
[24:46] am I believe Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[24:49] not the flesh now I say Jesus Christ and
[24:51] you know why I say it Jesus is the only
[24:54] name God ever had who was that back
[24:56] there that created the world it was God
[24:59] in another form called a son right you
[25:02] agree that's right or else you're
[25:03] trinitarian
[25:05] right that was God Almighty in another
[25:08] form called the word are the Son of God
[25:11] Amen Son of God is not God in two forms
[25:14] or three I mean you know another God
[25:17] right that's why I believe that we if we
[25:20] have the new birth today we are the
[25:22] children of God Amen called the Sons and
[25:25] Daughters of God but we're only called
[25:28] at because of the element we live in but
[25:31] we're really God made
[25:33] manifest yes
[25:35] sir in a form called
[25:38] son well now that's going a little bit
[25:40] too far now I think it's about time to
[25:42] say it like it is amen right well you
[25:45] think you're God I didn't say that your
[25:48] Prophet said it amen the Bible says it
[25:50] so you go argue with them then I'll say
[25:52] it so if you want to get me with
[25:55] it I believe anybody that's Born Again
[25:58] believer that have eternal life that's
[26:00] God dwelling in you that's right now you
[26:03] tell me it's not am if it's God dwelling
[26:05] in you who are you your God in human
[26:07] flesh again upon the Earth
[26:09] right well that's just a little well see
[26:12] there that's why you don't believe
[26:14] it you don't believe what the prophet
[26:16] said you don't believe what the Bible
[26:17] say but you say they'll say we B pass
[26:20] the word now what do you mean brother R
[26:23] said if we wasn't a part of the word
[26:24] before the world we never will be a part
[26:26] of it that's right
[26:29] you believe those quotes is Right amen
[26:32] all right so then what did we do we
[26:35] bypass the word formed
[26:39] body right see that's the way we should
[26:41] have
[26:43] come he came in a word formed body and
[26:46] stood out there we should have stepped
[26:48] out there in that same
[26:50] way right but yet it would have never
[26:53] brought a fall into condition it would
[26:55] have never brought the fatherhood in
[26:57] condition that he wanted to be
[26:58] you know wanted to really be it would
[27:00] have never brought the Savior the Healer
[27:02] the deliverer it would have never
[27:04] brought his attributes so it wasn't
[27:05] going to happen
[27:10] right but don't think you become the
[27:12] word here right
[27:16] see cuz you wasn't the word there if you
[27:19] wasn't part of Jesus Christ when he was
[27:21] on this Earth you never will be a part
[27:23] of Jesus Christ am all right that's
[27:26] simple that's right you see that's
[27:29] eternal life amen now see if you have
[27:32] eternal life eternal life never had a
[27:34] beginning right amen but there was a
[27:37] time we didn't have it that's
[27:41] right there was a time we didn't possess
[27:44] it oh but brother Dale I just believe
[27:47] down inside of me with that eternal life
[27:49] and I believe that quote of the Prophet
[27:51] what is a prophet saying is he contrary
[27:54] to the
[27:56] Bible then you don't need to be born
[27:58] again
[28:03] right you just need to
[28:06] die cuz you'd automatically go to
[28:09] heaven but that you know I mean I'm
[28:11] sorry I get on to that and that's just
[28:13] the way I talk and that's PL language
[28:15] but see but is it true or not that's
[28:19] right I believe you must be born again I
[28:22] believe you must receive eternal life
[28:24] cuz I believe you was born in sin
[28:25] shepher of iniquity spouse your mother's
[28:27] womb and went forth a li doomed and lost
[28:30] and on the way to Hell amen that's what
[28:32] I believe amen and you must receive
[28:35] eternal life amen Prophet said you begin
[28:38] it right here at the
[28:39] altar all right that's where it came to
[28:42] you
[28:44] amen but if I wasn't a part of that
[28:47] eternal life before the world I can't
[28:49] have eternal life today except by like
[28:52] the foolish virgins Etc one of these
[28:54] days will have cuz they'll have it by
[28:56] just an impartation for amen that's
[29:00] right Y and actually Adam himself was
[29:04] just by impartation he didn't go through
[29:06] a new birth that's why you and I must
[29:09] have the new birth we must go through
[29:10] that to receive eternal
[29:14] life all right then it always was
[29:16] eternal what the eternal life you
[29:19] have that's simple to mean now it just
[29:22] you know it but get to point of what I'm
[29:25] saying Jesus stood there in a word form
[29:28] body yep that's
[29:31] right when he appeared over to
[29:34] Moses brother Rand said it look like a
[29:39] man that's right I believe the one who
[29:41] stood there and created the world was
[29:43] not a spook or or something it's a glob
[29:46] or something no it was the man Christ
[29:49] Jesus that's right that Ste from an
[29:54] eternity down into that and it's
[29:59] not you go back and show me let's see if
[30:02] it's
[30:04] right brother Brandon would call that
[30:07] theophany like a baby playing before the
[30:10] father's door
[30:12] right but what if he
[30:17] mean he was like a
[30:22] baby
[30:23] oh like a
[30:26] baby when did he grow up
[30:31] right that's an example folks that's not
[30:34] a point that he was just a baby laying
[30:37] there and his goo goo gaga and a 4,000
[30:39] million years later he finally got to
[30:41] crawling and then he got to finally
[30:43] coming up and he got to you know and
[30:44] they finally become a man
[30:47] no it's it
[30:50] describing
[30:52] right it was just like a child playing
[30:55] before the father's door cuz you know
[30:58] what I believe as much as we get of
[31:01] eternal life on this side we're just
[31:03] little
[31:05] babies I don't care who you are and how
[31:07] much you think you know about the
[31:08] message and whatever it is we just still
[31:10] little babies that's right amen we're
[31:13] still playing with
[31:15] Rattlers sucking our thumbs you know and
[31:18] pacifiers as far as spiritually speaking
[31:21] right get off of that brother DL okay
[31:23] thank you now so let's go take some
[31:29] illustrations in the Bible in the
[31:31] prophet's
[31:33] message and let's see how far we can go
[31:39] back but we covered then Wednesday night
[31:43] that if we can believe that we was in
[31:46] him when he stood in that word formed em
[31:49] morphe body and if we don't believe we
[31:52] was in
[31:54] him we cannot be redeemed because the
[31:57] prophet said it's only the predestinated
[31:59] is considered in Redemption that's right
[32:02] all right that's in one of the quotes up
[32:04] and down in front of you right only the
[32:07] predestinated so we can't look and see
[32:09] that we had to be in him all right now
[32:12] that's how we can be redeemed that
[32:15] far but I'd like to ask you a question
[32:17] there I wrote my own a note for express
[32:21] it to be able to redeem us back to a
[32:24] place where he stood there you know in
[32:27] one word one
[32:29] body all right he stood in a
[32:34] body okay right now we had to be in him
[32:37] so we certainly know we was not people
[32:41] right mortality Etc because at that
[32:44] position he wasn't an immortal body
[32:47] either right that was a theophany right
[32:51] am a word body that was a whole lot
[32:55] greater than this old nasty garbage can
[32:57] we love to fix up you know and do
[33:00] everything
[33:04] you all right do we believe we was in
[33:07] him then how was we in
[33:12] him how was we in him and the prophet
[33:15] said if we don't believe we was in him
[33:16] we never will be there how was we in
[33:21] him we had to
[33:24] be a part of his own life that's right
[33:27] amen
[33:29] yes that's right and then the fall
[33:32] brought us into this
[33:34] condition of lost and doomed and thing
[33:38] but to redeem can bring us back to the
[33:42] place of his
[33:44] life now see here's where that you know
[33:48] I try to explain something to you that I
[33:51] see and I know it's
[33:53] hard but see when people say redeem we
[33:57] want to run away over
[33:58] under you
[34:02] know you know when that day that you
[34:05] receive that new birth and that Soul you
[34:08] know that soul is redeemed future home I
[34:12] think it's
[34:13] 49 the prophet said your soul is
[34:16] redeemed right he said but you're
[34:18] waiting Redemption of the body right
[34:21] right so now don't worry about the body
[34:24] it'll take care of itself later we just
[34:26] worri about the other if you you have
[34:28] eternal
[34:29] life the eternal life you received was
[34:32] what was in him amen that's what I
[34:34] trying to get across wi to see that's
[34:36] right all right now I'm looking at
[34:40] Redemption right here right
[34:44] amen so I believe the change of the body
[34:47] is going to be right here amen that's
[34:49] right it's not going to be we got to go
[34:51] up into heaven somewhere to be changed
[34:54] it's going to take place here we become
[34:56] Eternal bodies spirit and soul right
[34:58] here and go meet him in the air that's
[35:02] right that's the plan of redemption so
[35:05] don't when I'm talking about Redemption
[35:07] now keep it to the place that I'm
[35:09] talking about here is where we received
[35:12] eternal
[35:13] life if you have eternal life today you
[35:16] receive that eternal life one
[35:19] day there was a day you didn't have
[35:23] it God was looking at you and saying
[35:25] he's got it but we looking back at God
[35:27] said I don't have it that's right amen
[35:31] all right but one day see it got caught
[35:34] up with us amen the day you receive the
[35:37] new birth your soul was redeemed that
[35:41] day as redeemed as it will ever be
[35:44] redeemed amen is eternal as it'll ever
[35:48] be Eternal
[35:50] amen that's right because we receive
[35:53] God's own life amen that's right thank
[35:56] you Lord amen amen now so let's talk
[36:00] about Redemption
[36:06] here but I thought we going to be
[36:08] redeemed back
[36:10] there well if we can't see it
[36:14] here right you got problem trying to go
[36:17] back there that's
[36:19] right right but you
[36:22] see you say I always was eternal the
[36:25] eternal life you have always was eternal
[36:29] amen that's a simple statement amen all
[36:31] right now putting that into a mortal
[36:35] human being gives that human being Soul
[36:39] eternal life that's right
[36:41] amen so we're not waiting to Redemption
[36:44] of the Soul if you have the new birth
[36:47] it's
[36:47] redeemed
[36:50] right now this growth developments is
[36:52] all kind of things cuz we're not through
[36:53] in Ephesians we' got to go into adoption
[36:56] we got to go into the to the The
[36:57] Inheritance we got to go into the to the
[37:00] things with it when we get through what
[37:02] we're trying to bring but I'm trying to
[37:03] get us to see that see we we we want to
[37:06] look back
[37:10] there you know or we want to look over
[37:12] there you say well brother D you was the
[37:14] one that told us thank you if you can't
[37:17] go as far that way in your Redemption
[37:20] forward and you can't go back as far in
[37:23] Redemption to meet eternity then you
[37:26] don't know what eternal life fish all
[37:29] right now but you
[37:32] see if we can look back up into what we
[37:34] would call
[37:36] heaven and we would see it in
[37:40] heaven all right then we know for a
[37:44] certainty that as the prophet would
[37:47] say we were not Spirits we were not
[37:51] anything what were we he said we in the
[37:53] mind of
[37:55] God now the mind of
[37:59] God is the mind of God
[38:02] Eternal you got to agree it is amen but
[38:06] everything he thinks of is not Eternal
[38:09] right amen but everything he thinks
[38:11] of is eternally set that's right
[38:17] right all right that's the difference
[38:19] amen but now
[38:22] listen so let's go
[38:25] back and we see we can go back in our
[38:28] Redemption to where Jesus Christ stood
[38:32] so we got it all in him so we're we're
[38:34] right with the scripture that the Bible
[38:36] says that we just read in Ephesians that
[38:39] we were chosen in
[38:41] him before the foundation of the world
[38:45] that's right now is that what he said
[38:47] amen all right chosen in
[38:51] him before the foundation of the world
[38:53] right all right now if we can see that
[38:56] we were chosen in him then it's not
[38:59] really us trying to deal very
[39:03] much it's only coming to the basis of
[39:06] accepting that he had already accepted
[39:09] us right right amen all right now if we
[39:13] can do that then we can go back now to
[39:16] another situation existence position
[39:20] Etc that we can talk
[39:24] about so let's go back and let's read it
[39:27] now go to Job
[39:37] 38 Job 38 is a beautiful part of the
[39:41] scriptures
[39:43] okay you like me that's hard to find so
[39:45] you get Esther turn on over get over
[39:49] right before you get this TW Esther and
[39:51] Psalms and you could find it you got a
[39:53] scoffield Bible it's
[39:55] 594 all right
[39:59] now while you're getting there we'll
[40:00] start in verse one 38th chapter then the
[40:03] Lord answered job out of the worldwind
[40:05] and
[40:06] said who is this that darkeneth counsel
[40:09] by words without knowledge in other
[40:11] words he'd been up there talking about
[40:14] the things he had been talking even
[40:15] about God if you go back before and he's
[40:18] talking about all of the say you know
[40:20] and the clouds and the the all of the
[40:22] things right so who is this that darken
[40:26] the counsel by words with without
[40:27] knowledge G up now thy loins like a man
[40:30] for I will demand of thee and answer
[40:32] thou me where was thou when I laid the
[40:35] foundations of the earth declare if thou
[40:39] Hast
[40:42] understanding okay see of course today
[40:45] we've got all that
[40:49] understanding
[40:51] Bless but now just remember come
[40:55] on verse two says who is this that
[40:57] darkeneth counsel by words without
[41:00] knowledge
[41:02] right job was the smartest man in the
[41:05] world and he said and people come and
[41:07] sit at my feet and listen to me talk
[41:10] that's just paraphrasing it you know he
[41:12] could explain this and explain that and
[41:15] and all and the stars and the moons and
[41:17] the skies and the things right people
[41:21] just sat down and listened to him
[41:22] because just marveled at his great
[41:25] understanding so God just asked as him a
[41:27] simple
[41:29] question where was thou when I laid the
[41:32] foundation of the world declare if thou
[41:34] H has
[41:37] understanding letting us know and he was
[41:40] not he wasn't being derogatory to job's
[41:43] understanding because job's
[41:45] understanding come from
[41:46] God Amen you know about the things but
[41:50] he was just simply saying do you think
[41:52] your understanding can get this all
[41:53] figured out right that's it that's all I
[41:56] say to you and me or anybody else just
[41:58] listening well listen way I believe it
[42:01] bless God I believe it you ain't going
[42:02] to change me I agree with you I ain't
[42:04] going to try that's
[42:06] right just click off your computer turn
[42:09] off your tapes and forget it cuz I'm not
[42:10] going to try to convert you
[42:13] right cuz only God can give
[42:16] understanding that's right we can't do
[42:20] it as human Mortals it won't work all
[42:22] right so watch you answer me now if you
[42:27] you got to Great understanding who has
[42:29] laid the measures thereof if thou
[42:31] knoweth or who hath stretched it
[42:33] stretched the line upon
[42:36] it where upon are the foundation there
[42:38] are fashion in other words where where's
[42:40] the foundation of the world fashion
[42:41] we're out here in the space we're
[42:42] floating around
[42:44] around where's it all fing I guess it's
[42:48] on a
[42:50] Skyhook but now listen are who laid the
[42:54] Cornerstone thereof
[42:58] now so when this Cornerstone I notice
[43:01] verse
[43:02] six are who laid the Cornerstone there
[43:05] of when the morning Stars sang together
[43:09] so when was the Cornerstone Lake right
[43:12] exactly something took
[43:17] place now is he talking about the
[43:18] Cornerstone of the world or what's
[43:20] Cornerstone he talking
[43:25] about when the morning Stars sang
[43:28] together now the morning Stars according
[43:31] to page 48 of why we're not a
[43:34] denomination stars are angels so the
[43:37] morning stars are angels okay right all
[43:41] right now notice what they
[43:44] do when the morning star sang
[43:49] together all right and
[43:52] conjunction and all the sons of God
[43:55] shouted for joy
[43:57] all right now the morning Stars I said
[44:00] are
[44:02] angels okay so now the prophet said the
[44:05] first celebration and that's what we'll
[44:07] call this message
[44:10] celebration he said the first
[44:12] celebration was in
[44:16] heaven
[44:18] right the first time Angel sang there
[44:21] was in heaven when they were sing
[44:29] then the next time they sang was when
[44:32] Jesus Christ came on earth right you
[44:34] know the angels singing all right so now
[44:37] the angels we know who they are they're
[44:39] the the created beings and at this time
[44:43] see Angels had already been created at
[44:47] this
[44:48] position that God is speaking
[44:51] of because they begin to
[44:54] sing okay so Angels would was the first
[44:57] ones created right right and then from
[45:00] there came the other creations coming
[45:03] down see so he told him said g up
[45:07] yourself he come down in a in a
[45:12] whirlwind and he says job was deflated
[45:14] in other words he got where he seen the
[45:16] fact that he didn't understand right
[45:18] right I think they're getting a little
[45:19] too cool way everybody's raing up
[45:22] so but the first time Angel sang was at
[45:26] a c celebration right and it was in
[45:32] heaven so
[45:34] now we can go back that
[45:37] far right
[45:40] amen because the Bible declares it
[45:44] amen that there was
[45:46] a time position condition existence
[45:50] whatever you want to college you just
[45:51] put it all together I don't have the
[45:54] education but there was a place there
[45:57] and a Time took place and the Angels
[46:00] were singing mhm that's
[46:03] right now but then the sons of God were
[46:07] shouting for Joy so remember Angels Sing
[46:11] son shout
[46:13] amen all right
[46:16] right all right
[46:19] now brother brandom are you trying to
[46:22] preach some form of new religion
[46:27] now remember the
[46:29] story that is behind this that brother
[46:32] Ram in his early Ministry he runs into
[46:35] the uh Oneness I guess Jesus name people
[46:39] and he he's just a young Baptist you
[46:42] know and he goes there and he listens
[46:45] and he said here they was and he said
[46:47] these preachers and said this
[46:49] wonderfully marvelous he going through
[46:50] the scriptures and showing you know
[46:53] Jesus and the things and he
[46:55] says said they said well we going to
[46:57] have Elder so and so preach this evening
[47:03] and he said they brought this old man
[47:07] out black man had a big old long cat on
[47:13] right now I invite you to go look at
[47:17] this because see sometimes you know we
[47:19] have
[47:21] thoughts and uh you
[47:25] know you know
[47:27] somebody's preaching and we have
[47:29] thoughts
[47:33] right well you don't run around
[47:37] stalk brought this old man
[47:40] out he said he had a little white rim of
[47:42] hair around the big old Overcoat on he
[47:44] wasn't making fun of him he's describing
[47:47] him and
[47:50] uh he said now what in the
[47:55] world with all of these these young
[47:57] preachers is out here
[48:00] right why in the world would they put
[48:03] that old man up here now if you'll
[48:06] notice he tells that in almost every
[48:09] time cuz I looking the other day and I
[48:11] looked at probably 10 or 12 of them and
[48:13] every time that he'll tell it he'll say
[48:15] and I thought why in the world did they
[48:19] bring this old man
[48:21] up yeah said why didn't they get them
[48:24] young
[48:25] preachers to bring the message you
[48:28] remember the old brother he theyve all
[48:31] been preaching on Earth about what it
[48:32] took place in Jesus on Earth and Through
[48:35] the Bible and showing him said the old
[48:36] brother took his text over here in job
[48:38] and said where are you when the morning
[48:40] start saying together and Shout sons of
[48:42] God shouted for joy and he said there he
[48:44] come and his he brought him in his down
[48:46] the horizontal rainbow and he brought
[48:47] the second coming he just he just
[48:49] covered you could take that what he was
[48:51] saying there about the old brother done
[48:52] he done a wonderful job preaching you
[48:54] know said in a little while said he
[48:56] jumped up and clicked his heel and run
[48:57] off the platform said you ain't got
[48:59] enough room up here for me to preach
[49:02] brother random statement was then see it
[49:04] changed him pretty quick what did he say
[49:07] he said Lord if that can do that for
[49:09] that old man what could it do for me you
[49:13] know right well see he he was bragging
[49:16] about it but the point was like I said
[49:18] you don't ever have thoughts while
[49:20] somebody's preaching to you but see he
[49:23] turns around and he brings it right all
[49:26] right right but see people asked brother
[49:28] brandham in what he was preaching said
[49:31] is this some kind of a new
[49:34] religion he said no sir right he said
[49:37] this is the oldest religion there ever
[49:40] was
[49:42] amen all right that's number seven
[49:44] probably number eight along in
[49:47] there he said this is when the Morning
[49:49] Star sh together and the Suns of God
[49:51] shouted for Joy millions of years before
[49:54] the foundation of the world right
[49:57] he said the oldest religion y there's
[50:01] ever
[50:04] been little lady was asking him I like
[50:08] to tell things not bad about brother
[50:10] bandom but I like to tell them because
[50:12] we're we don't think brother randam was
[50:14] human
[50:16] yeah how many of you
[50:18] remember and you'll go over to number 14
[50:21] and that's not the only one that's on
[50:23] but if you look at number 14 of your
[50:25] notes you'll find brother brandham
[50:28] saying that he was in the hospital he
[50:30] had to get shots for going overseas and
[50:33] the nurse comes in and says sir do you
[50:35] want me to rub your

[50:47] over and let him rub his back
[50:52] y brother brand yeah
[50:58] it was just a human just like all of
[51:00] us you know I'm
[51:04] sure that 90% of you women sitting 90
[51:08] 101% of your women sitting here would
[51:12] get offended if you went to the hospital
[51:14] and found a nurse rubbing your husband's
[51:18] back
[51:20] right anybody going to do that I'll do
[51:24] it but you know brother Brandon that's
[51:27] not making him to be where that you try
[51:28] to De demote him no he's just human
[51:32] that's right you know he's just a
[51:36] human you've seen the videos of him
[51:38] where he's out there with his pistol
[51:39] swinging it around you know and do it
[51:41] got the alligator by the tail you know
[51:43] running it
[51:45] around and this he was just a human
[51:47] being that's right but it was God's
[51:50] Prophet amen that brought the work amen
[51:53] see people don't want to bring him down
[51:55] to that point they think you're making
[51:57] him too low no I'm making him what the
[51:59] Bible says about Elijah that he was a
[52:02] man of like passion as we are all right
[52:06] but listen the oldest religion in the
[52:12] world now that's what your Prophet had
[52:14] to say about it look at number eight on
[52:16] your notes there they said brother
[52:17] brandom that's that new kind of religion
[52:20] it's just a new case of the old religion
[52:22] is this old time why God asked job where
[52:26] was you when I laid the foundation of
[52:28] the world when the morning started
[52:30] saying together and the sons of God
[52:31] shouted for Joy before the foundation of
[52:33] the world that was ever laid this ain't
[52:36] something new it's something old it's
[52:39] the
[52:42] beginning the oldest religion that's
[52:44] ever been in the world started in heaven
[52:47] I
[52:49] right when the Angels
[52:52] sang and the sons of God shouted
[52:57] that's right now the devil's children

[53:01] there foolish virgins ain't there right
[53:05] people that have to be given eternal
[53:06] life is not there that's
[53:11] right this was a special group of people
[53:14] that's
[53:15] right well brother

[53:31] scale
[53:35] right what was back there so wasn't her
[53:42] body this is not a bodily form that's
[53:45] right
[53:48] amen wouldn't our
[53:51] spirit cuz it's surely not a perverted
[53:53] messed up thing that's right
[53:56] and this is not our mortal human
[54:02] soul I said that in a minute exactly
[54:06] what it said not our mortal human soul
[54:09] that we received we'll get to that this
[54:13] evening just trying to get a point to
[54:15] see that we were there to see we were
[54:18] there in the right way
[54:21] right well the the people preach this

[54:28] because I've listened to
[54:31] him I said not your body Brother Gary
[54:34] not your spirit and not your mortal
[54:36] human being
[54:43] soul but if you have eternal
[54:48] life the part of you that has eternal
[54:52] life was there yep right amen that right
[54:58] amen cuz remember
[55:00] now we've already brought it down to
[55:04] Jesus standing as a
[55:08] one word form IM
[55:13] morphe the
[55:16] theop so if we brought it down to there
[55:19] and you start becoming this way then if
[55:21] we back up into the mind of
[55:25] God don't try to back up with garbage
[55:27] can
[55:30] St
[55:32] right you know what I mean by that don't
[55:35] get your own ideas involved just just
[55:37] relax and
[55:38] listen and then ask God to reveal
[55:41] it all
[55:45] right so now brother
[55:49] brandom what was back
[55:54] there said it wasn't my body
[55:59] you said well I don't know about that
[56:01] well let's just read number nine on your
[56:04] notes while we are not a denomination
[56:06] 1958
[56:08] 927 and then before there was one Speck
[56:11] of Life on this
[56:14] Earth
[56:17] listen our bodies were laying
[56:20] here hallelujah
[56:22] amen before one drop of moisture ever
[56:25] come on the Earth we were laying here
[56:29] when Adam walked up and down in the
[56:32] Garden of
[56:33] Eden I was laying there amen yes sir Oh
[56:37] Glory when the Cherub
[56:39] beams the morning Stars sang together

[56:47] Breath of Life to
[56:50] come I was here he made me here had my
[56:54] body laying here yes sir it wasn't where
[56:57] you come from listen now it
[57:01] wasn't now they should have changed that
[57:04] and put periods and question mark
[57:06] something because read the
[57:07] statement the statement is totally
[57:10] confusing if you read it like just plain
[57:12] if you read it yes sir it wasn't where
[57:14] you come from M how did it get
[57:17] here see if you if you read that you're
[57:20] not getting what he's saying in other
[57:22] words he's saying yes sir if it wasn't
[57:25] another words you if your body
[57:29] wasn't in the
[57:32] world where did it come
[57:36] from huh you get it right you say but
[57:41] you added what he saying Heaven help you
[57:45] too in other words he's saying if it
[57:48] wasn't here in this world where did it
[57:50] come
[57:52] from how did it get here
[57:56] God had it laying here God made
[57:58] it we're made out of 16 elements
[58:02] petroleum said we were laying here okay
[58:04] now that's what I said we touched that
[58:06] about the body so they're showing the
[58:08] body is not up there
[58:13] right while the shouting was going on in
[58:16] heaven a world could be
[58:20] created our bodies were laying in that
[58:22] world if not where' they come from
[58:30] where did they come from if they wasn't
[58:31] in the
[58:32] world so when the world came our bodies
[58:35] were down why because of 16 Els that's
[58:38] right I like the one let's see I'll get
[58:40] it in a minute but I know where the

[1:04:07] church before the foundation of the
[1:04:11] world all right serpent seed page
[1:04:14] one de God the Great and Mighty God who
[1:04:17] formed All Things by the power of spirit
[1:04:20] and has brought Jesus Christ his only
[1:04:22] begotten son who freely died for we
[1:04:24] sinners the just for the unjust to
[1:04:27] reconcile us back into this marvelous
[1:04:29] Fellowship that we have again with
[1:04:32] God and as we are taught in the Blessed
[1:04:35] word that we had fellowship with him
[1:04:38] before the foundation of the world when
[1:04:41] the morning Stars sang together and the
[1:04:43] sons of God shouted for Joy way back
[1:04:45] before the foundation of the world how
[1:04:48] do we know that that wasn't at the same
[1:04:51] time that the lamb was
[1:04:53] slain that when God in his great
[1:04:56] thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing
[1:04:59] in our
[1:05:00] Salvation through
[1:05:05] Jesus so if I can shout here about my
[1:05:09] salvation they me I shouted there right
[1:05:13] you understand right now let me make
[1:05:16] this
[1:05:18] statement if you're listening you'll
[1:05:20] follow it real
[1:05:22] close everybody awake listening
[1:05:27] so if we brought it back in our last
[1:05:29] message trying to hurry if we brought it
[1:05:32] back in our last
[1:05:35] message that there was a
[1:05:38] time that the great
[1:05:40] Eternal Elohim self-existing almighty
[1:05:45] God stepped down in another form called
[1:05:48] a
[1:05:49] word not another God the same God
[1:05:53] stepped down in a form called the the
[1:06:00] word and he began to
[1:06:04] create and if we wasn't in him at that
[1:06:07] time we will never be there
[1:06:12] right the but the eternal life that he
[1:06:15] had is now in Us by the new
[1:06:18] birth so we're just as Eternal as he
[1:06:24] is all
[1:06:29] right
[1:06:33] then don't try to
[1:06:37] go back any
[1:06:41] further as little bitty
[1:06:47] pieces cuz we were in him
[1:06:55] so this existence that we're talking
[1:06:57] about where the morning Stars s together
[1:07:00] and the sons of God shout it for
[1:07:05] Joy there's only one
[1:07:08] God there's only one Elohim there's only
[1:07:11] one self-existing
[1:07:13] there's only one eternal
[1:07:17] life so the eternal life that you're
[1:07:19] talking
[1:07:24] about exist did before the
[1:07:27] world he was standing there now listen
[1:07:32] watch it tie together
[1:07:34] now when he was standing there before
[1:07:37] the world in that word form the
[1:07:41] ofing he was a many membered
[1:07:52] body right because we were in him
[1:07:56] amen he was a many membered
[1:08:00] body but there was only one person
[1:08:02] that's right
[1:08:08] right a many membered body stood
[1:08:13] there and was one
[1:08:17] person I thought we believe that ever
[1:08:20] that David could
[1:08:22] have a th wives
[1:08:26] orever have many
[1:08:29] had but none of them wives could ever
[1:08:31] have another husband right cuz that was
[1:08:35] a type of
[1:08:36] what Christ and the
[1:08:39] church and Christ and the church is a
[1:08:43] what a on membered body amen with many
[1:08:48] members one body with many
[1:08:53] members is that what we're talking about
[1:08:55] that's

[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:37] Redemption have went back there and
[1:12:39] tried to put something back there that
[1:12:40] wasn't
[1:12:41] there you when we get to the next
[1:12:44] message you're really going to have to
[1:12:47] think may be about 2 hours this evening

[1:12:51] you want to go home go
[1:12:53] ahead I want to finish what I got it
[1:12:57] took me 4 hours to
[1:13:01] write but
[1:13:05] listen in no form or whatsoever can you
[1:13:08] go further
[1:13:11] back as
[1:13:15] people than to go back
[1:13:18] there and get ourselves out of the way
[1:13:22] and back up into eternal life
[1:13:26] and realize the eternal life that you
[1:13:28] have was that word formed body word
[1:13:32] formed body that body that
[1:13:35] word that Bible that you
[1:13:37] are that word that you are by the new
[1:13:42] birth was what was in God before the
[1:13:45] world and it was there as one person
[1:13:50] right so
[1:13:52] now you can be redeemed
[1:14:01] he said well if you do then you're going
[1:14:02] out of existence now that's where you've
[1:14:04] missed the whole
[1:14:06] story see because here upon Earth we
[1:14:11] become the word right you agree that's
[1:14:14] right amen here upon Earth we become the
[1:14:17] Sons and Daughters of the Living God you
[1:14:19] agree that's right and here of on Earth
[1:14:23] we become a one
[1:14:27] many
[1:14:29] membered body of Jesus
[1:14:36] Christ you get
[1:14:38] it here on
[1:14:40] Earth we become identically what was
[1:14:44] there before the
[1:14:46] world wouldn't that be redeemed
[1:14:50] then you see we had took oursel out of
[1:14:52] existence CU I told you redeem go just
[1:14:54] as far one way to goes the other so if
[1:14:56] you go too far back you went too far
[1:14:59] back stay within the realm of eternal
[1:15:03] life I thought we believe that we were
[1:15:06] member members of his body I thought we
[1:15:09] believe the scriptures I thought we we
[1:15:11] believe that we were the sons and
[1:15:13] daughters of living God a many membered
[1:15:17] body that was dwelling on Earth that
[1:15:21] each member in particular supplying what
[1:15:25] they have need
[1:15:26] of and I thought as I said that David
[1:15:29] had many wives but they couldn't have
[1:15:31] but one husband
[1:15:35] right so how many wives did David have
[1:15:37] one
[1:15:39] right it's just many members of
[1:15:44] it how many brides does Jesus have one
[1:15:47] of them just many members of
[1:15:50] it we're members in particular one of
[1:15:54] the other
[1:15:56] y we have eternal life come on Brothers
[1:15:59] just sing a verse we have eternal life
[1:16:02] tonight today than that eternal life
[1:16:05] always
[1:16:06] was that's
[1:16:08] right so we're standing now back on the
[1:16:12] portals of life and looking
[1:16:17] down and see as we stood there in
[1:16:21] him now I'm going to say it so you go
[1:16:24] ahead and do what you want
[1:16:27] to he revealed his plan of what he was
[1:16:30] going to
[1:16:36] do to his little Min membered
[1:16:42] bride that's right I thought we read
[1:16:45] what the prophet
[1:16:47] said that's right see are you reading
[1:16:51] what he said amen we shouted for Joy
[1:16:54] when we seen the Plan of
[1:16:57] Salvation so if I can shout now then I
[1:17:00] know I shouted
[1:17:03] then but you see we want to make it
[1:17:05] little bitty people running around up in
[1:17:07] there that's the point I've tried to
[1:17:09] bring there stood one man almighty
[1:17:15] God the creator of all
[1:17:20] things and we had to be in him
[1:17:26] if not we can't get eternal life
[1:17:29] today we could be given it somewhere as
[1:17:32] a foolish virgin existent later on but
[1:17:35] you don't have it
[1:17:38] now but if you're a member of the body
[1:17:40] of Jesus
[1:17:41] Christ why would we want to go any
[1:17:44] further than where he
[1:17:47] stood there's where we were shouting is
[1:17:50] when he revealed that plan and he told
[1:17:52] us what he was going to do you want
[1:17:55] scripture for
[1:17:58] it Abraham is called what the friend of
[1:18:02] God but you know he's just a servant
[1:18:04] right
[1:18:05] am but he thought so much of Abraham
[1:18:08] till he said can I withhold anything
[1:18:11] from Abraham seeing he's the heir of all
[1:18:15] salvation and he come right down and
[1:18:17] reveal the whole thing to Abraham right
[1:18:20] right y can he withhold anything from
[1:18:23] the body of Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ no there's where we were shouting
[1:18:29] for
[1:18:30] Joy he let us know what he's going to
[1:18:34] do that we were going to
[1:18:40] fall but we could be
