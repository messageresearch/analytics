have some trying times and uh the trying times that we have means that we buckle up just a little bit tighter and if i don't want to i don't i don't like promoting other ministers because people get all yeti at you about it but uh there's brother chad lamb from llama ohio has a sermon that he preached about giving caesar what see caesar and god what's god so would be nice if you wanted to watch that he does a real good job he was a very hard-liner about not wearing masks and being this and that and the other and you know um but the lord kind of changed his attitude a little bit when he would read quotes for brother brown said my arms are sore from taking the malaria and taking all the different things that getting ready to go overseas he said that brother brown said i know i'm not going to get malaria he said but i'm going to satisfy caesar and do what caesar asked me to do but i'm going on for the glory of the lord so that's kind of what we're doing with our mask wearing and and hand sanitizing and all these things we're we're trying our best to uh to make it through i we've got up here on the board um if you want to in when you're home while you're home take a screenshot of this um and this will be the way that we will be um we don't have wednesday service up there we have wednesday at seven but uh sunday ten to ten and one this will be phase one back to what we were

will be created and announced at every service now listen if you don't hear your name called or if you need if you have a question go back to this that's why we archive these sermons go back to it and look and you can hear what i say um and you can get clarity i know a lot of people you know get confused about things but if you'll come back and listen to the sermon you ain't got to listen to the whole sermon just listen to the first part of it we try to um simplify this mess okay so mass will be worn when exiting your vehicle this would be just the ones that come to service to look at number one a list i'm fixing to announce the list right now you'll be the only people come to services masks will be worn when exiting your vehicle you'll be allowed to remove it in the sanctuary and we'll be distancing just like we've been doing keeping our distance and then when we get ready to leave the service put your mass back on you can congregate downstairs and talk if you want to try to keep a safe distance there won't be but 10 or 12 or 14 people here so but you need to make sure you wear your mask until you get ready to leave and go home all right this will be carried out until we announce that we will go to phase two now i'm not going to tell you what phase two is because you'll think that's phase one and then i'll get all these phone calls about the confusion this is what we're doing right now nothing different until i announce our brother dale announces that we're going to phase two right so we're gonna stay on phase one for a little while and i'm gonna announce the people that's going to be here on wednesday night now brother aaron is gonna be speaking wednesday night so obviously i hope he shows up all right then myself brother terence brother joe canada brother bob black brother luis yorego brother richard roberts brother tony smallwood brother gary krantz brother john duret brother anderson marunga brother josh dale and brother donnie falbush so right now that'll be the ones and we'll rotate that the ones that i didn't call some like brother ryan and brother kern and different ones they work in the evening so they're usually not here so i'll let them come on in somebody else's place on sunday but we pray the lord bless each and every one of you uh we're only going to have one service today but we will go back to this right here starting wednesday night all right so that's what we're going to do starting on wednesday night will be this list here what i just announced and this is the way we'll do it here until we decide to go to phase two which we will announce ahead of ahead of time all right also today is brother tony smallwood's birthday god bless you brother tony um we'll sing happy birthday to you when everybody's here that can sing so so we'll we'll forego that for the moment but happy birthday to brother tony uh known him for a long time he's a good brother and uh and got a a wonderful family there with uh we've known sister cleta for a long time also and sister asked herself god bless you um by way of another any other announcements brother dale those of you know he did not test positive so he's test negative but he's taking care of mom and mom tested positive for the coronavirus so she is quarantined at home and um she's doing better she had a rough night i think dad said at a point a little bit last night but we're still praying that the lord will bring a complete healing and um um you know i was i'm just going to tell you this it's i'm i'm human as much as you guys are um i was having a pity party yesterday you know why in the world why in the world why in the world and i just got finished reading the book of job and the lord said uh you need to read that book over again because we got no symptoms what joke job was just living a happy life job was wonderful he was a good christian at the time doing his sacrifices and doing everything he knew he actually went above and beyond and god said have you considered my servant job he called the devil's attention to job that was sitting over there in his rose garden sipping his iced tea and living in an air-conditioned house and then about a month after that he had no children no house his wife was telling him to curse god and die he had balls all over him and if you read the book of job job does wonder a little bit what's going on you know and then the then the the three accusers come they're really trying to help him but but they really don't do much because when that fourth man when elihu comes on the scene now buddy that's when elihu just rebukes them all and says shut up stand up job get off your pity party and this is what god has done for you and then job just really comes down to a place he said look he says i should have never been born he said but i'm here and then elihu said look at the end of this it's going to be better than it was than it was at the first he got a double blessing so we're looking for a double blessing we're not looking for something worse we're looking for a double blessing of what god's going to give us so let us not have our pity parties you know brother branham he had a few of them so we're i don't think we're allowed to have them we're supposed to trust god and go on but we as humans question a lot of things but god will give you the answer i'll promise you it'll be in the lives of the people in the bible and it'll be in the lives of the believers of today um we've got some good reports brother ron spencer's doing better um and you'll see that you can see that online where he's now um doing a lot better than they thought this virus has got in a lot of churches uh brother richie douglas and some of the different ones they've had it and we just keep praying that this will be something that is going to help us to not destroy our faith because a lot of people will it'll destroy your faith if you don't just say well i can't change anything you know god but god's in control god's the one that loves us he knew this was going to happen before the foundation of the world and he allowed it to come on us for a reason and we need to take the reason and not be a reason of having pity party but a reason said lord what's next what's next the believer the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord so you and i need to just keep on walking so this is where we're going to walk for a little while until we see something different i'll be speaking with brother dale we talk every day so we will um let you know when that changes so uh if you want to uh at the end of the service brother joe can put that back up um so that we can be clear on what we're going to do from this day forward all right we only have a few here today just four of us so we're going to go through now the feast of the trumpets if you pull leviticus 23 23 and i'm gonna try to skip through some of it um and get to the feast of the trumpets and not be very long even though we are 10 15 in the morning um we can uh we can get through this so leviticus 23 verse 23 let's bow our heads dear lord we come to a day father that has set aside lord to for us to worship you lord honor the resurrection lord i pray today that there'll be a resurrection in all of our lives lord of the message of the hour and while we're living here and what we're doing and realize why we're here and what purpose that we have in your great plan as brother dale's been talking about you having a plan and a purpose well i believe we were all included in that plan and i believe that we're not ever as being the bride of jesus christ this is one thing we can be sure of is that we're never written out of the script we're never written out of the play we're never written out of the plan we were part of the plan actually i believe the plan was purposely designed for your bride lord so that we can see and be overcomers in this age father we pray that you'll be the ones that are sick we know all the ones that we try to call lord to list is getting long father we pray that we'll that lord you'll hear our earnest prayer and that we will truly only believe because all things are possible there's nothing formed there's nothing there's nothing that man can come up with in the evilness of their heart or their mind whatever this virus wherever it came from we know lord that you are the king and you have no one above you and lord you love your bride because we stand by your side and lord we know that nothing will come upon us lord that is not gonna this that's going to hurt us yes and the footsteps really are the righteous our order of the lord so we're all lord as we saw job walking through his life lord he did some checking up to make sure everything was okay and lord i believe that's where the prophet got the quote that we always quote where brother branham tells us he says when you've done all you can do stand so job did all he could do he did everything he could do and he just stood and finally lord you came on the scene and you told job exactly what was going on through elihu the young one father we pray that you do that today come among us in a way that that we can understand you and your blessings will be upon us father in jesus name we pray amen leviticus 23 23-25 when the lord spake unto moses saying speaking to the children of israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets on holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord all right so let's um if you want could you pull that chart up for me um brother joe we can be seated and lord add his blessing instead of going through all the different ones let's just do it on the chart and we may just skip all the way down i may just highlight a little bit but i want to get to the feast of the trumpets because i want to bring a little something out that um that i believe the lord showed me yesterday on those trumpets so when we were starting our our um i guess you might say series on this um the feast i wanted you to see israel's part of this but i also want us to see that it's for us if it's the feast of the lord then it's for all of us all right it's for everyone that's here that we have to go through we we have to as a christian we have to go through these yes amen because israel had to go through these it was required now a lot of times they didn't do it a lot of times they forgot to do it and all these different things but you and i receiving the baptism of the holy ghost puts us to where we are aware of all these things that are going on we're aware that we have to that there there had to be something die for me i couldn't die for myself but luis couldn't die for me brother bob nobody could die for me and then transform that life into me to give me eternal life all right there was no animal there was nothing but a man had to do it but but to show in simple form god allowed the sacrifice to be done with animal blood to show that he's coming to be the ultimate passover lamb not just a lamb that you bring in and he's all perfect he's not broken bone and all these things are are fine but you're getting ready to kill that lamb yeah all right so the perfect lamb of god came on the earth god with skin on him john testified behold the lamb of god takes away the sin of the world showing that he was going to be that passover lamb that he was going to have to wait several years though and and grow up and all those different things to come to a place of calvary to where he's going to be the passover lamb as they were killing the lamb in the temple the lamb of god was dying on the cross for all their sins they turned him down they didn't care about him he was just to a roman soldier he was just another guy that they were going to crucify and throw him in a ditch you know they were just going to throw their body over in a pit put some lime on him and be forgotten and never know this person ever again and that's the way that was but now we know for a fact that that's not what happened that joseph of armathea took that body and put it in a tomb according to what the bible tells us that he was in the belly of the earth so many days and so many three days and three nights and then while he was gone the feast of unleavened bread began the next day they got all the leaven out of the house jesus christ's body was laying in the tomb his leaven was there he was doing he was down in the in hell preaching to the souls in prison in his theophany but his literal body was right there in that tomb it didn't go with him it stayed there in the earth and then what happened was on the day of first fruits that theophany comes back up and attaches he's the bread he's the bread of life he tells you many times he is the bread that come down out of heaven but remember that wasn't unleavened bread that's right it was a loaf when he fed the five thousand he fed him loaves he didn't feed him the the unleavened bread because it's like somebody asked that well where'd you see this leaven come back listen they always use leaven this is just the time the type of unleavened bread is is take those seven days clean yourself out in other words get rid of all the false doctrine get rid of all the sin and all the things in your house all right for those seven days or for those seven uh virtues or for those seven whatever you want to call it seals the seals to me is unleavened bread all right because it's the word of god the word of god's unleavened bread the word of god but jesus was standing in his leaven he was stan he was the bread of life which was a loaf as brother brown said we we didn't read it but brother brown tells us many times he said wow he said just think about a man reaching and get a loaf of bread that had been that had rose and been baked in an oven and as he was giving it out another piece just pops back on there what kind of power was that jesus didn't have a little convection oven sitting beside of him that he know it was being made because he was the bread of life and it was connecting to him he said you keep eating this in other words you eat the flesh of the son of man drink his blood that's what he said but we got to get the unleavened bread out of our soul out for our sin that we have in our house and even as we go up the statue of a perfect man there's still things that we need to get out the trash that's what this symbol is but it's just seven days so after this seven days they go back to eating bread with leaven in it so it's just a symbol of those seven days or seven church ages or whatever sevens you want to type it with is a time that you and i set aside it's a time that god set aside that he quit dealing with the jews started dealing with the gentiles dealt with us through seven church ages got all the 11 out of the people in each age yes each age had 11 which was what the doctrine of the pharisees doctrinal issues is what jesus was talking about so get that unleavened bread out now that doesn't mean that you put see you've got to watch your type that doesn't mean that after seven days you put the you put the 11 back in but you have to put 11 back in because of the feast of pentecost because you got to live in this thing christ had to live in this thing christ says i'm like i said he said i'm the bread of life not that little small matzah no he was the bread he was the full loaf of bread that came down out of heaven my the manna that they ate in in the children of israel here it comes down and just falls down every day and it's already cooked or whatever it needs to be done and it's little wafers and the bible says it had everything they needed and he made their clothes stay on you know stay clean and everything else so so god really took care of them like he's going to take care of us so there's the next day the 14th day of the first month is the passover the very next day starts unleavened bread and then what happened when christ was killed on the cross it just so happened that all those three days lined up together because the first fruits is the moral ab after the sabbath which that was the sabbath all right that saturday was a high sabbath because you had unlimited you had to pass over unleavened bread and then that monday was the feast of first fruits or that sunday sorry that sunday sunday right there look sunday was the feast of first fruits and then that feast of first fruits is what you go get your mature most mature plant you bring it to the priest the priest waves it before the people and says hey this is all good we have the first fruit now but that means that you can go out and gather whatever you got and remember that spring feast that was a barley harvest not a um wheat harvest the wheat harvest is right here in the feast of weeks the wheat matures after the barley so we mature after christ matures christ had to come to maturity first but he was just common barley he was just a common man common people hurt him gladly he was not understood but i believe this is what i believe that god has put focused all his attention on the bride right the wheat the sustaining life the wheat harvest is when he came on the day of pentecost which was 49 day you had you had to count 49 days seven sevens 49 days until what until the next day which was the feast of penta are 50 days after christ raised yes that's why i said before brother brown you know he's 30 to 40 days after his resurrection see we come on in here to the he he goes up and ascends and about 10 or 11 days later is the day of pentecost he said go and wait in jerusalem until you're endured with power on high so that's the same way with here what happens with us when we are harvested or when we come to a resurrection we're going to have 30 or 40 days before we are raptured because jesus was raptured about 40 days after his resurrection then he come what he couldn't be here at the same time the holy ghost is here because it's two people the same person came back on the day of pentecost and didn't just cover the people he went in the people and when the day of pentecost was fully come the bible tells us and thank god we had a prophet that could sit here and tell us as we were talking about before when we were talking about the passover god sent us a vindicated prophet he sent us an angel or a guide the holy ghost and what did brother branham come to do i was thinking about this the other day if you want to put it all in a nutshell why did he have to come he came to tell you you were sinless his whole message is to tell you that you're the sinless perfect bride of christ that's already been spoken in the bible it's been preached on for generations but this comes to the full part of when we get over here we'll see that in a minute but we have to come we come to a day of pentecost where we receive the baptism of the holy ghost you didn't and and don't click off but you didn't need a prophet to tell you that okay you didn't need a prophet to tell you how to get the new birth you wasn't supposed to now brother brown did but on the day of pentecost was peter james john not really prophets you might say major prophets the holy ghost fell on believers all right then paul a prophet comes on the scene he gets the baptism of the holy ghost so here you see that take 1906 azusa street when they had their pentecost it didn't take a profit it didn't take a man to walk out and say hey you need to be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost no brother brown said the holy ghost came himself and baptized them into the body with signs and wonders and all these different things and then just as paul came on the scene a little bit later after their pentecost 1906 here comes brother branham in the 30s and the 40s and he's telling these people that now god is telling you hey you got to be justified sure you can speak in tongues sure you can have these evidences but you got to go back to the beginning true pentecost when the holy ghost fell 2 000 years ago to where those disciples you say disciples there's 120 in the upper room they weren't all disciples but they were in the upper room and they were tutored by the lord justified and sanctified walking in that direction jesus breathes on him and says receive you the holy ghost but it didn't happen until the day of pentecost but when it did it fell on the people that had walked with the lord himself for three and a half years so now but then remember from right here in type in type from from the day of pentecost 2 000 years ago everybody got that say amen inside say amen all right 2 000 years ago there was a long period of time there was seven church ages from pentecost to the feast of trumpets in type everybody got that in tight wasn't exactly seven years or it wasn't exactly seven months it would but it was this is your longest gap pretty much from your fall fee or from your spring feast to your fall feast so same thing with you and i in 1906 azusa street god came on the day of their pentecost in 1909 1906 azusa street they had their pentecost but they were speaking in tongues shouting and all these things but what did it take it took from 1906 to about 1912 to bring in the jesus only water baptism but then you got 1933 and then up to 47 it was a long period of time from that 1906 azusa street experience for god to bring a prophet on the scene to sound the original trumpet that israel's been going through the whole time because remember a trumpetism is is is something that speaks it's something that listen if you're standing out in and well we don't congregate anymore but if you were standing out in a crowd and one man had a little horn and he might have been 300 yards from you but if he goes what does that do that turns everybody everybody gets quiet and they turn their attention to see what that noise was all about so god wasn't silent for all these other church ages god wasn't silent from 1906 to 1933 or 30 whatever time you want to think say that brother brown got his commission but we know in 1947 is when we started listening to the message all right whatever he spoke before that was fine and it was his growth period but he sent a prophet to sound a trumpet and i know it's kind of getting a little off of my order but you know what this is what it's all coming to this is the whole this is a like daniel 70 weeks this is daniel 70 weeks this is to the jews and they get a natural happening listen they get natural they don't get a natural trumpet but the trumpets in revelations 8 and 9 are real but that's not the feast of trumpets the feast of trumpets we'll read in a minute it's a blowing to get it's a blowing of a noise to get your attention because what they're gonna do is and we'll look at it in a few minutes the trumpet is sounded on the first day of october all right everybody got that it's kind of strange luis is the only one sitting in the building and i'm looking over here where brother danny sits and all the different ones so um and oh i forgot brother danny if you're listening i said brother donny but brother danny's right behind that you want to come to all right but we come here to the first day we'll read it because that's what the bible says but now remember there's nine there's 10 days and we'll read it the bible tells us but i'm going to read you what they do in israel because that trumpet is blown to in other words wake the people up from this long time of slumber they've went to work they've done their job they've paid their bills i'm talking about natural natural israel has done all this through the summer heat of the summer right now we're in the heat of the summer right now probably we are in the heat of the summer of our christian christianity our heat part of our journey but what happens during that heat part is when things start maturing amen all right and the bread starts rising all right i need to go get some water i forgot i'm getting water excuse me all right so now we've come to in type they've waited this whole summertime and then what's going to happen right here these fall feasts are a little bit different from these now all right you've had a a harvest here of barley you've had a harvest here of wheat now remember their cycle is different from ours israel is in america you know we do all of our planting in the spring and we usually finish by here but now there is a fall crop and i'm fixing to plant a fall crop that we've probably never done before in our family but a fall crop until we come to the time of frost when i watch there's only one more there's another one right here another feast another harvest i mean there's three harvests here here and here and what's god doing he's heart he's bringing the first fruit he came on the day of pentecost to bring us what sustaining life he brought us that bread that jesus was talking about right so you look at and you see on the in the feast of pentecost what happened you bring in two loaves of bread out of your habitation you baked it in your oven amen you baked that in your oven and it was your responsibility to bake it with what you had oil and flour or wheat that was ground up and you made the loaves and you put them in the oven you baked them to a certain temperature and then you presented them to the priest all right so what are we doing now that's what happened on the day of pentecost peter james and john and all those in the upper room they were standing there and you can type this all the way through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost because god didn't send us a prophet after this long period of time to proclaim or to announce the trumpet to get back to what to get back to the original faith of the fathers which is justification sanctification and that's what they were telling he was telling them that's why they started kicking him out a little bit later he said look speaking of tongues is good but the devil's speaking tongue right you can live a good sanctified life he said that's just good he said but you've got to be justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost and look at everything the pat look at your life and all the things that you do well what the there was a gospel trumpet sounded in our time just like we're going to see this feast of the trumpets that's why you know that's why brother brown didn't preach the seven trumpets that's all to israel he had already preached them in the sixth seal because the sixth seal is going to happen to israel when we're gone those trumpets are gonna if you'll read we might read them later on but not today each trumpet had a different thing that they poured out and it wasn't good okay it's under the judgment time that you and i are not here see you and i go through all this we're harvested on this last feast of tabernacles because god's not just gonna take our soul that's right he's taking this too this tabernacle is going and then when it does then the revelations 8 9 and the trumpets seven trumpets are gonna sound through those two prophets which we're not gonna be here but what are they gonna call them back to they're gonna call them back to that day of atonement amen all right we'll get into that when we get into atonement they call them back to the day atonement not that christ has got to be killed again everybody got that say amen christ has not got it they not got to back way over here and say jesus christ because see they're looking for him to come they're looking for their messiah to come right israel the jews not the whole maybe we say the religious ones the orthodox jews they're waiting on something that's already happened correct so what the two prophets are going to do is god's going to give them the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen after we leave he's going to fill them too with the holy ghost and they're not they're going they're not going to relive this in other words christ is not going to come back and die again they're going to come to this feast of atonement now what we're going to get to the feast of atonement what it does it shows you it's a morning m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g not a.m but you're mourning for something that's already been done all right so they're going to turn them back to and say you miss this because this happened 2 000 years ago and you missed it then what they're going to do is excuse me they're going to get the living out of their house they're going to receive the holy ghost just like you did justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost all right not to make them bride because see the bride age is already over everybody got that the bride age is over we're gone right so there's no more bright age gentiles are bride only everybody got that right now there's some jews scattered in there and different ones but i'm talking about he will not he's not even dealing with israel until we leave that's right now don't get it in your head that god's not dealing at all he's working over there right now remember god's in motion all the time he's not waiting for me and you to leave and you know doing this no he's working but he can't do what he said he would do in the bible while we're still here so you and i had to come through let me run through this one more time because i'm getting ahead of myself but i want you to see why i'm i'm not preaching this just to tell you what israel's doing this is for me and you because this is what god does he shows us that he died get the unleavened bread out we got to come to maturity get the baptism of the holy ghost and then you got a journey you got to go through months and months of journey but you may be there one day you say well i heard one sermon or i heard two sermons or and that's okay you can get the holy ghost without hearing the prophet that's right amen without hearing of william branham you can get the baptism from the holy ghost because he didn't come to bring the holy ghost to us like it was taken away no the way to get it was taken away it had been falsely taught so much until it took a man with a message a trumpet to not change see that trumpet doesn't change any of this that day of atonement doesn't change any of this it's a we'll read it in just a minute it's a realization of what god's done already all right so you and i had to hear a gospel trumpet we had to hear a sound john heard a noise there and sound in revelations one he said i heard a sound of a voice as of a trumpet and i turned to see the voice well he wasn't looking for somebody standing you know trumpet over there out hanging in mid-air he knew that voice that's right so that's what you and i did we knew that voice now we may have been born again somewhere else that's okay i don't mind you can say that if you want to but you had to hear to become a bride of jesus christ under this church age messenger right you had to hear a trumpet amen you had to hear a blowing you had to hear a trumpet sound in your heart yes because why does why does the world why have you i've heard many of you and myself to you you talk to people about god sending a prophet and all these different messages and the way he brought it and all this and and some people just it's an uncertain sound it has no ring to it but what about the ones you see though that you've told about the message and it just transforms everything that they think because it has to that when that trumpet sounds of this message of the hour see it changes and when a trumpet sounds you remember there was a trumpet to go to battle there was a trumpet to retreat there was a trumpet sound to move left there was a trumpet sound to move right because that's what everybody depended on so we depended on a true certain sound that's why brother brown preached you know if the trumpet has an uncertain sound the bible tells you that don't listen to it but how do you know it's a certain sound because you know it's characteristics you've been taught all right now see you can you can get the holy ghost and hear the trumpet at the same time but some have come through other denominations even through the pentecostals and i believe if you receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's fine but when you heard that trumpet when you heard that little man say good morning friends or when you hear a tape or hear somebody talking about the prophet of god it's a different sound to that that's right but now when that sound comes and it's a true sounding in your heart you will gravitate to it not run away from it because if you hear that true sound it says charge do you hear the calvary you know that there's a i just got this there was a command from above there was a command from a general that was looking over the battlefield he had the high ground that's right he had the high ground and he could see what was going on and he said oh we need to charge over here because the enemy's getting ready to be defeated or there's a weakness in this line right here he says sound the alarm charge in that direction well those soldiers had confidence in that sound of that trumpet not just the sound of the trumpet that the notes were perfect right right no it was the authority behind that trumpet that they had been trained that you hear this certain key this certain noise you go in this certain direction and you charge because there's a general that knows what he's doing standing up there watching over you that's right i hope you're running around in the living room there's a general that knows what he's talking about and he has give the command to charge and you put your whole confidence listen they put their whole life in it that's right because what if he was saying retreat the enemies built up a great big camp over here and they're coming in this direction but this other preacher over here come on there's no i think we need a charge he hits the charge sound they're gonna die that's right but this general has enough confidence says hey pull back so i like what general robert e lee says he said let's live to fight another day and that's what we're doing now with all this stuff going on we're living to fight another day we'll have our day brother donnie fall bush and i were talking yesterday the devil can laugh all he wants to but the bible says we look at that man and say is this the man that caused nations to fall he's just like a sock drunk on the side of the road so we're not going to get the last laugh but we do read the book and see who wins so the devil does not win but see we know we have confidence in the general though when he says charge then the full authority of that army is behind that and that's what we were looking at here when we saw a little prophet come on the scene we saw the authority of god behind him so much to when he would speak things would happen amen and that's the same way that we're coming to with you and i that's why brother brown talks about coming into speaking condition where you get a message and a messenger we know the messenger is true we've just got to get under that message that's right to be the final voice of the final age we've got to get under that general but we've got to carry out what he said quit fighting about it if he's wrong here and the dates are wrong and this is wrong and he's wrong here and i heard somebody tell me the other day that a certain individual's not coming to this church anymore because i said brother branham was wrong i never said brother brown was wrong i said he made mistakes just like we make mistakes and in the daniel 70 weeks he didn't make a mistake he was right what he was saying we just weren't interpreting exactly what he was saying because you got to go back to the bible go back to daniel 9 and read the three periods you say but brother brown said hold on a minute you're listening to an uncertain sound you hadn't got you you hadn't got lined up with your general right you get lined up with a general he tells us what to do and we go do it right excuse me so here so now we've heard that sound we as believers so what's happening in natural israel natural israel has went through all this they've had their feast they had to wait 49 days and on the 50th day they had a feast feast of pentecost all right a one-day feast that's why everybody was gathered in jerusalem when the bible says the day of pentecost was fully come in the book of acts then they had to wait for a long period of time several months to have a trumpet blow now what they're doing now is they haven't had this yet in the two prophets sure they're doing this naturally you understand what i'm saying there if you look online but what they've done they've turned it into like a festival okay where they they do a lot of natural stuff they eat this natural bread and they they they hide leaven so they can make a game out of it why because they don't think their messiahs come so they're just they're saying oh this is the old testament this is the torah we've got to do what it says it's just become a ritual to them just like brother uh just like brother brown just like god said you these have become these feasts and these sacrifices have become a stink in my nostrils because you're just you're just going through the motions all right because remember this is when jesus went into the temple right before passover if you'll read your bible and i think you'll see a quote where brother brown says that's he was in the temple before the passover and the priests were selling animals birds and doves and lambs they were selling it in the temple so that they could put it up for so many days and then have this feast of passover not that they went out there this is why jesus was mad number one they didn't go out there it tells us to find a lamb go out in your find the first fruit find the firstborn put him up for so many days check him out in other words you do have something to do with this that's right okay you have nothing to do with parts but this part you got something to do with and what they were doing was they were just going up and saying hey joe i need a lamb here's five dollars give me this lamb and the priest says everything's fine yeah we've checked him out and probably they had not because they wanted the money and the money was going on inside the church and jesus stood there and watched them and i believe it boiled inside of him yeah the bible says he got angry or whatever you want to call it that's right because you know why i believe it's been revealed to him that he was the passover lamb and that they were doing to them what they were going to do to him because that's what they did they killed they killed the passover lamb and just he hung between two thieves he was just another person to the to the romans he was just nothing he what didn't have any power he was just he was really a weakling yeah but all no god hiding himself in simplicity but he got a little bit ill with them charging money just like what happens in the catholic church you pay money for novenia's you pay money for a priest to go and do his whatever to bypass telling christ i'm sorry to bypass repenting to jesus christ for what you've done you just tell that priest and he says oh pay me five dollars stay for hail mary's and everything's fine well see jesus christ if he was here standing on earth he'd do the same thing to them that he did to the ones back then all right so but we see the natural feasts are done every year they just keep doing them but you and i see and jesus christ christ at that time writing this was writing this for them to do to remember him to remember jehovah at that time he was jehovah to remember jehovah because remember these are the feasts of the lord that's right all right remember the feast of the lord what you're supposed to not look at the priest or or look at joe or somebody right beside of you or or whatever you're supposed to look to christ this is showing the christ being the first fruit that he was gonna bless them on this day of pentecost that he was gonna blow a trumpet for them to come to a place to take 10 days and to really check yourself out all right then the day of atonement to remember that back here in the spring of nissan 14 there was a lamb guy that died amen for your sins that's right amen even in the natural when you say that by louise even in the natural that makes you feel you feel man you take that one day and the lord brings back to your memory that there was a little bitty lamb that got up on that that you threw up on the altar cut his throat and he died you went through all these things sure but you come right here to this day of atonement you realize what christ has done for you see that's the same way with you and i what really brings us close to god is is this message of the hour has totally rided the ship we've been denomination and all this and father son holy ghost and all these questions and all these seals and daniel 70 weeks god brought us a true trumpet to right the ship so that we know what direction we're going in we have a what we look back to our spiritual rudder you always got to look back to your spiritual rudder that's why that it bothers me when we talk about daniel 70 weeks and and uh some of you brothers were there when we had the minister's meeting there was 20-something ministers that didn't even have the book they wanted to come there and they want you know they had their tablet with their number one quotes on it but they never studied it out never read the book probably even never listened to the tape why they've always been told to stay away from it right some of them didn't have the book some of them might have had the book but it looked brand new all the hours look worn out because you go it over and over and over again but you know what we studied to show ourself approved we heard the correct trumpet now i'm not listen i'm not saying those ministers didn't have the holy ghost by no means but they don't have they didn't have a true teaching or a true trumpet sound we know what the general said daniel 9 24 there's three distinct periods a one week another a 62 7 69 and then one more weeks left after the rapture i don't care what anybody says yes right the bible says that when he shall make a covenant with many for one week who is that the antichrist listen we're already gone by then amen but he makes a covenant with these jews for one week after we leave and that one week will finish 70 weeks because 69 is already determined right you just read your bible you got to make the quotes fit the bible you can't make the bible fit the quotes because we know what the general said amen all right jesus christ is our general brother brown was not our general but he's right there what he's right there that it was a voice that god spoke to a vessel a trumpet that god spoke through to get us the right sound when we needed it and we needed it in this end time we needed a correct sound why because we're going to take a tabernacle change we're not we sure we took everybody millions of people have took a spiritual change everybody got that millions there's going to be millions of bride that takes a spiritual change but there's only going to be one group that takes a natural change and not have to see death that's it and that's the feast of tabernacles that brother brown said you and i are now feasting under it's the feast of tabernacles where they go set in the booth correct amen we'll get to that but see that's your last harvest that's when the reapers are going to come and they're going to harvest and that happens in the fall one day day number one of october day number 10 of october and then day number 10 through 15 and 15-20 we'll get to it and we see that they go then for a period of time they sit in the booth but see you and i spiritually though we go through every one of these i want you to realize that that every one of these you and i have to go through we have to go through a time of pentecost and because we're going to read about your trumpets in just a minute we got you and i have to realize we've come to a day of pentecost that we've received the baptism of the holy ghost all right and then we've got this long journey now you say well now i heard this trumpet back over here that's all right but the feast of the trumpets is when you come to one day or one time in your life where you say that ain't nothing but the truth amen yes haiti wright was a born again believer she had probably heard brother branham since the 30s 40s maybe she went to church but one day she come to a place of a third pull to where it wasn't it wasn't brother branham speaking it was him saying hattie you've come to a spot because when she said that ain't nothing but the truth what she was doing was vindicating that that was the truth what the trumpet was sounding that's right everybody got that so that's what you and i must come to that we know that the truth of what sounded when we say that ain't nothing but the truth it changed the world for two kids for two guys two kids two children so that's what it needs to be for you and i that's why we talk about coming to speaking condition and then we come to the day of atonement because i believe we truly got to realize and see you gotta look back when they come to that day of atonement look what they do they back up all these months and realize way back over here in the beginning of your journey something died for you so don't ever forget jesus christ don't ever forget calvary don't ever forget this man died for you but you and i have come through all these feasts and we've come and we're coming around this way and we're heading to this right here but let's stop right here and let's read just for a minute i know we got to skip through brother joe all the excuse me all the quotes down to the very last one here somewhere where it talks about the feast of trumpets if you can find that brother joe it says trumpets and it's right at the almost the last two pages where we're going to talk about just for a minute you'll be fine we'll just talk about it defeat because the feast of the trumpets is not it's a one day of blowing of the trumpet all right so they went through that long period of time like i said we've labored all these church ages we've labored through all these uh listen folks we're gonna have a glorious time because look the same trumpet that called you here what did you tell brother charlie cox he said the same sound same voice that said turn around is one day gonna say come up amen yeah we're good see the same voice so it's not gonna be you're gonna hear a sound here and it's gonna be different here that's right the same loud voice the prophet says that raised lazarus the same trumpet that raised lazarus from the dead is the same trumpet that's going to sound through a group of people and bring the dead out of the ground because jesus christ won't be here see remember he left he left right before pentecost and he's not seen again until he comes back in two witnesses now sure he's in his bride but he's hidden jews think we're still dogs we're still dogs to them we have no oh yeah you got religion and you got you know this jesus man he was a good man he's a prophet and then you've got the group that says well muhammad was a good prophet and this one buddha was a good prophet and then you see what i mean see when somebody starts sounding that's why when i was with those two mormons and nothing against the mormon doctrine i i just i just can't it's not a familiar trumpet sound but you hear what their doctrine is now to them that's a trumpet but it's not blown in the right way their general was not the general okay we've got to believe that the right general sent the right message and we're hearing the right trumpet because when we hear other people talk about uh especially if you have you been sitting in a room somewhere i remember we were sitting uh years ago at a certain meeting with five or six hundred people this brother was preaching away and all the hell that we you know basically when we were babies there was eternal life in us and i mean all the people were just up and shouting except for about six or eight i was brother richard wilson was there and all my family some of the people from church were sitting down this row and we just sit there because i don't believe that right i believe you had representation i believe god gave you an angel because he knew by foreknowledge where you would go and what you would do and where that seed would land but you weren't born with eternal life in your soul it wasn't but one person and that's jesus christ period yeah and adam but adam wasn't a baby adam was full-grown all right so what happened they were hearing a sound right they were hearing a trumpet they were hearing someone speak bringing their view and probably 550 of the 600 people or 590 of the 600 people were shouting their you know their shoe hills off what we always say and we didn't why because it did it was an uncertain noise and i don't say that belittling but sometimes you just hear noise because when a trumpet sounds from god it always has a meaning remember he doesn't do anything forever he doesn't just stand up and say and then there's nothing behind it no whenever god sounds a trumpet right there's something going to happen all right so that's what's going to be with us here excuse me we heard the trumpet sound of this message and then we've got to realize that it is the true sound of a trumpet that's right now listen but be careful you say well i heard luther's trumpet because it was right it was right for his day it was right for his concert his concert was different from ours his concert was justification would take him into a uh receiving of the baptism of the holy ghost because that's all god required he required this sheet of music for luther all right now wesley he required another sheet of music now not doing away with this sheet of music because this was included in it right amen but then you come to where we see pentecost they blew a trumpet god blew a trumpet but remember god kept moving on he turned the page to another sheet of music so you and i in the bride age but look you know where we've come to look here where we've come to that's the last sheet of music there's nothing after this so there's no other sound that we get now we know that sound goes to israel that trumpet goes to israel and they hear the sound of those two witnesses which calls them back to the day of atonement we'll get into it later on the day of atonement where they mourn and zach around all the different places they separate from their wives they go and mourn because they had killed their messiah and didn't even know it right but god said oh stop don't worry about it this is done to preserve life i was going to get a gentile bride out of this and then you're still coming in amen so here we go trumpet here we are at the trumpets we'll just for a few minutes and the lord spoke unto moses and said speaking to the children of israel saying in the seventh month all right the seventh month in the first day of the month you shall have a sabbath all right there's your style you have a sabbath it doesn't matter if it's the seventh day it's a special day what was the special day you heard the trumpet you got to have one well i just heard no there was a special day when that trumpet sounded like i said before and something rang different from any other sound you heard you've been hearing messages from baptist and luis come from baptist into pentecost and then up to the message there were sounds going off everywhere there's sounds going off all in the world but there's one true trumpet and when israel come to that one day that one day the first day of october the first day of the month they had a blowing of the trumpet everybody stopped and i'll read the commentary about what happened because the bible really doesn't tell you anything it just says you shall have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord all right let's go to isaiah 58 1. this is kind of uh and actually this is the scripture that that the lord called me to preach on right here uh i was reading isaiah 58 getting ready to do a sunday school class and i read this and i said june read this right here and see what this says and june read the scripture right here and she said god's calling you to preach so this is it right here but look cry aloud and that's me that's tony i'm allowed cry loud spare not lift lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins and then it continues on down talking about more of the blowing of the trumpet and telling different things but this is look a voice like a trumpet so a voice has always been compared to a trumpet and we'll next sunday if you go to revelations 1 john says i heard a voice that sounded like a trumpet talking to me so there's your symbolism he didn't hear two truths he said he heard somebody say john and when that voice rang in his ear he knew that was that man he had seen on the shores of galilee he knew that was that guy that said you know um some of you will not some of you will not die until you see the lord coming in his glory well see that john to john that was a trumpet he knew had no uncertain sound because when he turned i don't listen remember when he turned he saw seven golden candlesticks and one like the son of man in the seven gold candlesticks his surprise was is when he turned to not just see jesus standing there all right but he saw jesus in the seven golden candlesticks in those seven stars messengers that brought these people because remember without people you have no church ages you got to have believers in every church age you can't just have seven stars and oh these are great men but these great men right here were nothing without somebody hearing that sound that message that trumpet i mean what would be brother branham if he just came and preached in 1947 and 20 people heard him and nobody believed him and why he just you know he just went out of existence he did just you know because many have done that but no he had a message and it corresponded with the holy ghost that was in those believers oh now some got for the fishes and loaf some got caught for the healing but remember brother brown said that was the bait on the hook it was bait but the hook was a message there was only a certain other group that had took that page from pentecost and had turned it to the message of the hour amen and then he goes off the scene and all these a lot of people they leave i didn't believe to start with but they leave but here you and i we've made this long don't pull the chart back up but from from that long day of pentecost all the way down to this last church age me and you have heard a trumpet sound and it was a voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression in the house of jacob their sin ezekiel 33 verse 2 son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword now watch this watch this right here this is happening in this day as we speak you have got to determine everybody with me you got to determine whether your watchman is telling you the right thing or not watch son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword what is the sword sword is the word when i bring the word upon a land and if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set him for their watchmen their pastor you might say if you want to are there prophet you can go on all the way up there too if you want to if when he seeth the word come upon the land or the sword what this is listen excuse me let's back up for a minute what what is this there's a watch tower that's why they call it a watchman on the watch tower brother brown preached watchmen what of the night good sermon to listen to but that watchman is there's one on all four corners of the city and their job is is to stay up and they didn't have binoculars back then but they had real good eyesight and they were way up here above everybody else that sound familiar and they had an eagle eye and they could watch a long way away when they would see maybe a light coming then they would see dust hear horses they would scream down the army's coming the enemy's coming or he had to make this is what i like he had to make the choice whether that was army or a friend or foe because it could just be a bunch of your own people coming in you don't want to shoot them all right so the watchman had a lot to do now watch when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people when we see a false doctrine when we see little things in our lives little things that we do god sends us a pastor that's why we need a pastor we need somebody with some leaven on him yes that's right that god can speak through amen listen god spoke to a prophet no doubt but you can't take out there we go back to the bible we can't take out ephesians and we can't take out the two loaves which is christ in the bride all right you can't take that that god's not gonna use and look you can't take this right here away either then whosoever watch this now now look the watchman's job is to warn the people now it's the people's job to listen or not right everybody got that yeah then whosoever people in the city you know you got you got them standing outside you know and they're talking and they're of course social distancing and they're they're talking about work and they're talking about this and they're talking about that and and then all of a sudden they hear the noise of a warning to warn you the enemy's coming that was the watchman's job then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning oh that's just old brother dale up there he's just blowing that trumpet again yeah just keep blowing the simul trumpet preach the same thing over and over again brother bob up there why he's up there meddling all the time and brother louise brother oh they're just now look if the sword come our false word come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head but he heard the sound of the trumpet and took no warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul amen but if the watchmen see the false doctrine come or see the sword come or the enemy come and blow not the trumpet oh i think that that's just a very small army i think they'll just you know they'll just they're going to turn in another direction there this old fox doctrine about this thing and another this thing and another i don't worry about it no it's it's an enemy it's an enemy but if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman's hand easy i'm telling you folks everybody wants to be a pastor come on that's right you read that right it's required what i've always said people bicker number one they're not here but people bicker about the pastor taking tithe listen excuse me the bible tells us to pay our tithe you got the monkey off your back when you pay your tithes you've done what the bible says god will bless you you will have not have to stand before the lord and say i didn't pay my tithe you pay your tithe now what abc what what a does with it pastor whoever does with it he's got to talk to god about it right so it's not your job to bicker what he's doing with it it's not you've done your job when you do your job you leave it alone that's right because you start bickering it's going to come back on you amen but look that's why we need to if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet so see how important the blowing of a trumpet is or the sounding of a message is and a sounding of the correct message now see dwight moody was good brother brown said he took millions of souls into heaven okay but they're all dead now laying in the grave waiting the prophet of god now he comes up and he blows his trumpet now he's one of the seven stars he's not just a trumpet blower he's not second chair and third chair if brother paul was here and looks like he left it he must be coming back he left his horn and his and his flute here so amen what a sign anyway so if but if he's sitting here though and excuse me goodness and uh he hears a sound that's not familiar listen if you hear a sound that's not familiar don't immediately cut it off but you gotta test it with your with your spiritual angel the one that was given to guide you the one your holy ghost because sometimes you may hear something but then a long time after that you see it come to fruition we listen we're instant people we like instant gratification instant answers we like instant this and we like instant that everything's instant we got to have it today we got to have it today but remember from the feast of pentecost to the feast of trumpets there's several months in there there's a period of time that god is allowing us to go through things and to hear you know dwight moody we hear we we say okay that's great but god moved to another page of music okay he moved he brought the concert up and if brother paul was sitting second chair and third chair well see that means you're sorry your second best and third best but when you set first chair you're the best of the best so brother branham set first chair remember the conductors of jesus christ but brother branham said first chair because he knew exactly what that conductor wanted done so he played first chair the the sound that we should hear you say well you just said he made mistakes he made human mistakes but folks when it comes to doctrine he cannot make a mistake that's right no way could he make a mistake because then god couldn't require us to come to full adoption if we only had peace or we had something missing sometimes we don't know what we have we have the pure unadulterated word just like jesus christ standing on the earth two thousand years ago in human flesh and him speaking to the disciples we have that same message and if jesus was wrong we're all wrong yeah and when we go to judgment we can say you were wrong and he can't judge us but if we were chosen in him brother dale's been preaching we've chosen in him jesus christ has been judged the righteous one the true conductor the true trumpet sounder the true watchman now he has delivered now watch this though he has delivered though bible he has delivered that message but some pick it up and go well i think he's three now that's not jesus christ sounding the trumpet man has come in and added a note yes so if you add a note i don't know much about music but if you add a note though and the note's not added to the whole everybody else playing flute and trumpet and all these other or all the other things and you've got one note missing or you've got one note added what does it do it ain't right it messes everything up so what we've got in this day folks is we've not got just a hit and miss we've not got just a second chair or somebody that might miss a note every once in a while we have a star in the hand of him in revelations one of those seven stars was the spirit that was with william branham in william branham and telling us what god's mind is how can somebody say let's go back in the back part of god's mind when he can't go in all in the whole and get it 100 right right he'll say let's go back into peace sure the back part is a piece but that's your thinking that's your intelligence but if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned and if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman's hand and then we'll read a little bit more but now they don't you don't have this so i'm going to read it real slow excuse me got some congestion today forgive me this comes from um the internet sorry but i was looking at it because sometimes you you know the lord just says we're gonna have one day of blowing the trumpets and then that's all it says but you have to get the history behind it and the jews have the history behind it of what they god wanted them to do because this has been repetition for them for listen to this jesus has been gone 2 000 years right moses was 2000 years before so for four thousand years the jews have been going through this so they must have something right we know they're going through it in symbol form but man you wait a little 144 000 realize that they've been going through that for 4 000 years and then them two witnesses go there's jesus christ the passover there he was laying in the tomb as unleavened bread there he was the first one out of the out of the grave as a first fruit and on the day of pentecost remember in your history jews remember in your history something happened on that day of pentecost in 80 30. something happened because uh it was noise abroad that something happened now y'all might have shot it down and but now see remember in 1870 god promised he's going to destroy it all so he just dispersed them everywhere but listen to this what is the feast of trumpets i'm going to read this from gotquestions.org but i really like it because remember this is as we said before listen to me their religious calendar started on nissan or abim or march april everybody got that say amen amen all right that's their religious calendar that's the one god told them to go by right because he said to moses this will be the first day of the month for you which will be the passover so they that's their yearly calendar for religious services are religious feast but their civil calendar what they go by now their civil calendar starts in october which is what we're talking about now we're talking about uh sivan or i can't remember the name of it but we'll get back to it in a minute but listen to this the feast of trumpets marked the beginning of 10 days of consecration and repentance before god so it really doesn't tell that in the bible but it does you read between the lines if you'll bring that chart back up brother joe excuse me goodness i picked up a frog somewhere that's no covet frog hush so you got right here which is tishri 1 all right so now we're here at tishri 1. now from history 1 to 10 the bible tells us on the tenth day there should be day of atonement but watch what they do in between there now watch what this now you and i you and i come through this we heard a trumpet sound something's going to happen because see there was a long time in here but a trumpet has sounded an alarm right right because there's three more feasts that's got to be done in the year everybody got that and these are happening boom boom boom you know pretty close together long period time and then boom boom boom that's why i say now you say well brother wait we've heard the trumpet if brother brown's message of the trumpet i'm talking about the 100 the number one chair trumpet believe that number one chair trumpet all right which now is fivefold ministry apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists if we stay as brother brown said if we stay under that star right under her messenger she'll be the final voice of the final age under her messenger under her star because see he's he's the star star of the show all right we know jesus christ is the star but he sent a message because he had seven stars in his hand we got a picture of it back there seven stars in his hand and those people if you get it you're gonna get it from them seven right amen but now remember i want to ask you a question here for those of you that that that believe that we need to just listen to tapes i got a question for you columbo was the messenger to the fourth church age correct according to brother branham say what's on tape columba wasn't even in his church age that's right he died before his church age began he was actually in martin's church age but columbus message now how can a dead man preach because listen luther was here luther never had a denominational bone in his body he brought the pure unadulterated word for the time one of the seven stars that god depended on to bring the message but when he died some carried on the truth some carried it to denomination columba he must have preached we know brother trevor had went over there and i liked the little snippets that he that he sent back to us about how that columba was a messenger of he had light around him the whole time there was light everywhere he was at there was all kinds of lights and different things but remember if he died before his church age began his people he was a star he died well then who took them through 1500 years of dark ages the preachers the ministers that caught the message of columba caught that message and didn't even have a tape recorder or books to put it on it was by memory but god by the holy ghost give them enough memory to remember what columbus said and they carried 1500 years by the preaching of columba and him not even being in the church age so if you want to listen to tapes all your life that's fine with me i you know i just like i said i ain't here to fight about that i didn't hear that trumpet sound right amen amen i didn't hear that trumpet the trumpet i heard was was from a fivefold ministry that was sounding the true watchman that was sounding the truth that was coming whether it be enemy or whether it be friend friend or foe all right that's why i said we need to align ourselves with the truth amen so but watch this but so the feast of trumpets so they went through this okay let's say we're now we're jews for a minute okay we're jews for a minute we we celebrated the day of pentecost we had this great big feast we we gathered all the wheat in we got it in the garner we're we're making our bread we're making our this we're we're just having a good time it's hot yeah we're trying to make it through the air with air conditioning or not we're trying to make it through and all of a sudden we know that come october the 1st are history the 1st there's going to noise come that noise wasn't before but on this day and i'm going to try to get it i had it one time and i cannot find it maybe my my brothers back there can find it bro louise somebody can somebody sent me a video showing me the literal day of the feast of trumpets in israel and how many of them horns that whole city you can't hear nothing but horns and they got the little shofar which is the one i think the one that we call that joe got us back here the rams horn then they've got them great big old things that curl around and i'll get it they curl around and go way up there high some of them have to sit it on something to blow it or they have to sit it down to blow it but man what a noise but what does it do hey something's fixing to happen that's right something's coming we've had a long time of just slumbering and sleeping and going through the message of the hour but i believe that you and i now have come to the feast of trumpets amen because watch it's beginning of 10 days of consecration and repentance before god it is one of seven jewish feasts or festivals appointed by the lord and one of three feasts that occur in the autumn now we know that just leave that chart up there its name the feast of trumpets began on the first day at the new moon of the seventh month its name comes from the command to blow trumpets in leviticus 23 24 and numbers 29 1-6 it is also called rosh hashanah which means head of the year which now that becomes their civil calendar that the civilization runs off this is their first day of the year and they go this way all right everybody got that because it marks the beginning of the jewish civil calendar during this celebration no kind of work was to be performed but burnt offerings and a sin offering were to be brought before the lord in the leviticus passage the word trumpet blast are a translation of the hebrew root hebrew root were a word teruah that's what that says yam yam teruah which means listen to this a shout are blowing a shout out the shout the voice the trump amen the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a huh shout he said brother what about right brother that was back in 1963. it was to brother brennaman 1963. but was it to you you got to have your own that's right trumpet sound your own shout your own voice to come to a place because watch it appears that the shofar or ram's horn was to be blown at this time as it was on the other new moons that's in psalms 81 3. i'll see if we can post this next sunday afternoon or yeah sunday afternoon brother will be here wednesday jewish tradition indicates that both the ram's horn and the priestly silverhorn the hazazaria zera hazaria were used in the feast of trumpets the feast of trumpets listen to this was important for several reasons first it commemorated the end of the agriculture and festival year because see that's the last month that's not the last day there's a there's a feast there's three more but they happen boom boom boom just like this happen boom boom boom right so they know that listen remember we're natural israel we come to this day and the whole city is nothing but blowing trumpets you don't do anything you just grab your trumpet and you go to blowing your trumpet well that's in the natural but they know that 10 days later they've all got to go into their house and be sorrowful for one day that's what the atonement's for then they get happy again a few days later because they got to go get in their little booth and they make their little flowery things and we'll get into that a little bit later and i'll show you some pictures of it a little bit later first it commemorates the end of the agriculture and festival year the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout a voice a trumpet when the trumpet of god shall sound time shall be the mourn all these different things when the voice voice trumpet see we've been through this message for all these years we've got the baptism of the holy ghost we've been through all this but there's going to be one time that you and i are going to hear a shout that's it it's not the shout to get in the message come on all right it's the shout to get out of here because this is the last push this is the last harvest there'll be no more gentile harvest after this right here amen now sure there'll be tires i'm talking about wheat but now remember wheat got harvested here what gets harvested here fruit that's right fruit gets harvested oh we'll get into that it's really good because i am the vine here are the branches where's the fruits fruit on the vine nope fruit's on branches amen so he's and what's he gonna do he's gonna harvest your fruit we'll get into that it's really good all right now look also the day of atonement fell on the tenth day of this month and the festival festival of booths begins on the 15th day the blowing of the trumpets on the first day of the month heralded a solemn time of preparation for the day of atonement so that was the beginning it was just a one day blowing of the trumpet but you realized something's fixing to happen amen the blowing of the trumpets on the first day of the month heralded a solemn time of preparation for the day of atonement this preparation time was called the ten days of repentance are the days of all awe the trumpet sound was an alarm of sorts and can be understood as a call to introspection and repentance so we've been through this long church age we've been through this long time of being in the message the prophet's been gone for 60 years almost we've heard trumpet right we've heard the gospel trumpet but remember when you get over there in them other trumpets when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and the time shall be no more and all these different things that's different right not a different horn but he's not blowing it through the one guy anymore he's blowing it through the people amen because maybe we can find that but lord what a noise well now one person can't make a lot of noise you put one guy in the middle of two million people or 10 million people in in the city of israel and he blows some little like a little flute like this right here who's going to hear yeah no but when the people when the people pick up the message and they begin to blow a trumpet they begin to proclaim liberty remember a trumpet had to sound to proclaim liberty in that 50th or jubilee year amen the feast of trumpets along with the other six festivals of the lord foreshadowed certain aspects of the ministry of jesus christ the prophets linked the blowing of trumpets to the future day of judgment and i read this one but i didn't bring it blow the trumpet in zion now who are we we're the dollars of zion we're going design sound the alarm on my holy hill let all who live in the land tremble for the day of the lord is coming it is close at hand that is joel 2 1 and also zephaniah 1 14-16 in the new testament we see that the lord's second coming will be accompanied by the sound of a trumpet amen amen we know that first corinthians 15 51-52 and first thessalonians 4 16-17 and we'll read that next sunday to begin right there at the feast of trumpets and go to the feast of atonement but listen to this because we'll read these you can't do you can't rule out revelations eight through nine each of the judgments in revelations eight through nine is signaled by a trumpet it's going to take two witnesses to go over there right and sound a trumpet to release the seven trumpets that's right amen we'll get into that but now look you got to remember something the feast of trumpets is different from the seven trumpets but there has to be a blowing of the trumpet to me and you first before it can go and be a natural seven trumpet judgment to the world through the two witnesses everybody got that that's why brother branham wanted to preach the trumpets preach the seven trumpets preach the seven trumpets preach the seven vials remember he was pushing he was trying to get a building he was trying to do that and then god told him finally told him he said god finally told me the other day he said i went into the room and said god why he said they're not to you they're not to the gentiles remember he's a gentile prophet he said they're not to you he said there to the jews and you've already preached them supernaturally in the sixth seal that's right wow he'd already preached him he didn't even know it he was a prophet ah he learned just like you and i learn but when it hit him look at the then he goes and preaches the feast of the trumpets and he brings the feast of the trumpets in talking about the lord coming the day of atonement so will the trump of god call us to heaven and warn the world of coming judgment so brother brown preaches feast of the trumpets he said i wondered all my time why them seven the seven trumpeters are not to us because they're plagues and they're to israel but the feast of the trumpet is what hey that's right get ready amen you're coming to a place to realize where you are yeah and what you're doing here that's the feast of atonement to make israel realize that there was a lamb way back over here to us 2 000 years ago to them several months ago that they remember that that priest put that lamb on the altar slit his throat the very next day they went through and cleaned all the leaven out of their house eat unleavened bread for seven days then they started into a barley harvest and they had to bring a first fruit into the priest priests had to wave it before they could eat come up to the day of pentecost which meant to them it's another festival something to eat because they're wheat harvesting see that's all natural then like i said you got all this time that really nothing's going on and then all of a sudden god says hey wake up amen got a little work to do because i'm gonna make you realize as a human being god helps us to realize what he's done for us we come to that day of atonement listen jesus christ don't have to get it back on the cross again that's right we just got to realize that he did get on the cross and that he died for me then what's going to happen here that's going to move out to the feast of tabernacles where there is a joy because this is the final harvest god's going to finally harvest all of his fruit and the fruit of my labor and your labor and everybody else's labor brother dale's labor the fruit of the labor is going to be harvested and we're going to be taken to a marriage supper praise of the lamb let's stand to our feet those of you that are home god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's just bow our heads and say a prayer be dismissed um you have you have your own service or prayer service or whatever you need from the lord he's present to give you what you need he's in your tabernacle you don't have to find the booth to get in he found a booth one day and it's you that's right and he wants to show his fruit through me and you amen the fruit of the harvest is now it won't be long we've been through this long i was thinking the other day you know we we as young people younger people haven't been through what brother they own some of their brother pageant i was thinking about all them what they've been through and how they've seen people blow on certain sounds blow other trumpets and and them have to get up on the tower and have to warn people of it you know some people say why do you have to warn us about i just read to you why we have to warn you i have to warn you about these false things because you know what it's required of you if you don't do it that's why i said we i don't it's just hard to say that everybody wants to be pastors it's a big responsibility and brother dale's shouldered this load for a long time and god's helped him he's standing right there in the middle of that virus and doing just fine so we we ask the lord's protection on him and on us and all the ones that are that are sick we pray that um that the lord will sanctify them wash all that out clear this thing out so we can get back to church but brother joe while we're praying if you don't mind bring that phase one back up again and then we'll be dismissed god bless you we'll see you wednesday night seven o'clock uh we'll have a regular service um for singing uh so you'll be leading singing and we'll have a few musicians and the others will be here and and just have a regular church service so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord just pray we've heard a shout we've heard the trumpet we're here in the trumpet now to get the last bit ready so that we can look at what god's done for us and that's what they did in israel you look back a solemn times it you look back and you look at job and job was human and he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost but he did have an anointing of god but he could sit one day he said though god slay me and i'll trust him oh i don't even wan i wish i had died before i took a first breath that's what he said before and my mother when he said i wish i'd never even come to this earth he said but i'm here and he stood up one day and he said i know my redeemer liveth in other words i gotta have somebody i'm in a bad place i got to have somebody to bring me back he said i know my redeemer liveth and in the end days there'll be a trumpet blow and the dead in christ shall rise first and we'll take off and job said in my flesh i shall see god amen so what a and it's not a hope we hear people say oh this is a blessed hope it's not a hope it's a reality i don't hope that god's going to change my body if i pass away or if i live to the change he's going to change my body one way or the other he's going to change all the people down through them seven church ages they're going to hear a trumpet and it's what's he going to do brother louise it's going to say hey we need to go back there we need to come back through here we need we need to come back we're they're ready they're ready for us now we're ready to come back and get we've had to shout had the voice i'm right here waiting on just that last little bit last little bit to come in little brother baptized sunday god bless him and the different ones that we see god moving in their life and brother zach and sister nyla and different ones lord just really dealing with them and we didn't see that a year ago two years ago you know but it's their time and then the next time i i pray that if you are watching in that that it'll be your time next it'll be your time to receive something from god so let's buy our heads the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray lord

we need to get us out of here it's the things that we need to line us up for this last push to get us out of this place where there'll be no viruses lord there'll be no sorrow no pain no agony lord we

recipient of that trumpet that sounded when we turned lord one day you'll sound that trumpet and the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain will be changed and we'll all be caught up lord it's not a hope it's not a blessed hope it's a surety a reality lord the ones that don't have that reality yet we pray lord today that you would touch them as we speak even the
