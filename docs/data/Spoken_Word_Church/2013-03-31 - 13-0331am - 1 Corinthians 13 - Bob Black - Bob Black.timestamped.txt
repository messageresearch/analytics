[0:00] all right here we go we're live
[0:09] Sunday morning
[0:14] good morning
[0:17] so brother Wade's traveling Nanny's not
[0:20] feeling well
[0:21] um let's just let's just start off with
[0:24] a little prayer real quick just to pray
[0:25] for everybody Lord Jesus thank you God

[0:54] with her Lord granted Lord that you'll
[0:56] open the word through our hearts in your
[0:57] in your name we pray amen
[1:01] all right now I wanted to uh
[1:04] read from First Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:07] this is just a little chapter
[1:09] and just kind of talk about some things
[1:11] that might pertain to this um Easter
[1:15] morning
[1:16] foreign
[1:17] you know there's a uh you think about
[1:20] that Christ has Rose he rose 2000 years
[1:24] ago but what's the proof of that how do
[1:26] you how do you know now you could say uh
[1:28] let's get on the internet and look at
[1:30] this picture of a tune uh across the sea
[1:33] that um we're kind of almost speculating
[1:36] that that is the actual tune and uh we
[1:39] can look at different things that people
[1:42] say and and do but what what is the real
[1:45] evidence of what the resurrection is and
[1:48] uh I think that's kind of what First
[1:51] Corinthians chapter 13 was talking about
[1:52] now first first Corinthians chapter 12
[1:55] you know Paul was he was laying down to
[1:57] the church uh kind of getting things in
[1:59] order telling them what the
[2:00] non-spiritual gifts are to to quicken in
[2:03] our in our lives
[2:05] to cause us to realize that God is in
[2:08] our midst the nine spiritual gifts are
[2:10] the gift of Prophecy when somebody
[2:11] raises up and start starts speaking in
[2:13] tongues or
[2:14] um or prophesying or the gift of wisdom
[2:16] comes up and starts telling people
[2:18] things that uh in their lives and
[2:20] different things like with Solomon then
[2:23] it causes us to realize that God
[2:27] amen amen
[2:31] but in the
[2:33] at the first verse the last verse of
[2:36] chapter 12 Paul said now now those are
[2:38] all good things the nine spiritual gifts
[2:40] those are wonderful things but covert
[2:43] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[2:45] unto you a more excellent way now come
[2:48] on up with me a little bit higher I want
[2:49] to show you something that you can
[2:50] really base your Christian experience on
[2:52] that well you can that that proves the
[2:54] resurrection that proves the
[2:56] resurrection in you
[2:57] know I speak let's start at verse one of
[3:01] chapter 13. though I speak
[3:03] with the tongues of men in the rains and
[3:06] have not charity I've become a sounding
[3:08] brass
[3:09] or a tingling symbol now we know that
[3:12] there's
[3:14] there's so many different ways you can
[3:16] go with each one of these little
[3:17] scriptures that you can take this though
[3:19] I speak with the tongues of men and of
[3:21] angels now he just got through going
[3:22] through the nine spiritual gifts and and
[3:24] laying out how the God gives a gift of
[3:28] speaking in tongues in the church and
[3:30] how we you know that's the the early
[3:32] Pentecostals put all their faith in that
[3:34] that that that is that is my evidence
[3:36] that I've got the new birth is because I
[3:38] speak in tongues and it began to cause
[3:40] impersonations and things you know uh
[3:42] somebody
[3:43] somebody here was telling me of a
[3:46] Pentecostal Church they went to where
[3:47] everybody was slain in the spirit and uh
[3:50] the the minister went around laid on
[3:52] hands and everybody fell out on the
[3:53] floor under the uh under the anointing
[3:55] and and then one of the people on the
[3:57] floor
[3:58] feet
[3:59] to see if everybody else had gotten up
[4:02] see it causes uh because it wasn't
[4:05] genuine something and you know brother
[4:07] Branham said that if that's what you
[4:08] need if you need to uh if you if if
[4:11] that's what you're you're kind of basing
[4:13] your experience on that to speak in
[4:15] tongues and he will actually let you
[4:17] speak in tongues so that you can you can
[4:20] rank hang on that but uh Paul's saying
[4:23] let's let's go up a little bit higher
[4:25] I'll show you more excellent way that
[4:26] you can base your experience on and uh
[4:29] that what Paul is talking about here is
[4:32] charity and I'll we'll get it in a
[4:34] second what what charity really is and
[4:37] it really is given to the poor
[4:41] though I speak with the tongues of
[4:43] meaning of angels now brother Brandon I
[4:45] was listening to a sermon he spoke on
[4:47] about um
[4:48] uh the Corinthians the book of
[4:51] Correction the the book that uh uh that
[4:54] sets everything in order right because
[4:56] the little Corinthian Church needed to
[4:58] be they had a lot of problems you know
[5:00] they had that uh that brother that was
[5:02] um living with his father's wife and but
[5:04] you know in second Corinthians chapter
[5:06] seven it tells it everything ended up
[5:08] all right he he was restored to the
[5:10] faith and lots of other things in in
[5:12] First Corinthians that Paul is just
[5:15] trying to correct and um
[5:17] and you know brother Brandon got talking
[5:19] about how he was on he was listening on
[5:21] the radio to uh somebody talking about
[5:23] uh that this this uh this fellas got
[5:27] started talking about the book of Psalms
[5:29] and he was reading these scriptures and
[5:31] it just sounded so wonderful now now
[5:33] keep in contacts they'll all speak with
[5:36] the tongues of men and of angels that's
[5:37] what that's what I'm talking about and
[5:39] uh it sounded so wonderful what he was
[5:41] bringing and everything was true but
[5:43] this was a it turned out to be uh I
[5:46] never heard of this fella Jimmy Osborne
[5:48] who was a rock singer back in the day so
[5:51] uh his his life didn't match up you
[5:53] could you can talk but talk but if
[5:56] you're not walking the walk
[5:59] that's that's uh that's what this
[6:02] chapter is about I am become a sounding
[6:05] brass or tinkling symbol and that's what
[6:07] that fill ended up being on the radio he
[6:08] was just he was just uh rattling his
[6:11] gums so to speak it it uh he could um
[6:15] he could read the scripture and uh say
[6:19] what somebody else was saying but when
[6:21] it came down to him to to the life being
[6:24] made manifest in him it wasn't happening
[6:26] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[6:29] and understand all Mysteries and all
[6:31] knowledge now there's a big one if I can
[6:34] understand all Mysteries now now uh uh
[6:37] last Sunday we're kind of looking at a
[6:40] few Mysteries
[6:41] Mysteries that are open up like like
[6:43] Paul started looking up the mystery that
[6:44] the Gentiles would be part of the church
[6:46] what about the mystery of who God's name
[6:49] is the mystery that is there's just one
[6:51] God instead of three the mystery of
[6:53] water baptism all these Mysteries that
[6:55] are opened up and you can understand all
[6:57] these Mysteries and repeat after
[6:59] somebody but if if God's not living in
[7:01] you then then uh you don't have that
[7:04] surety of the Resurrection on this
[7:07] Easter morning though I have the gift of
[7:09] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[7:12] and all knowledge
[7:14] I was reading about how that uh that
[7:16] there used to be two thousand years ago
[7:18] there used to be this library in
[7:19] Alexandria that had all of the books for
[7:22] the ancient world and they had uh and
[7:24] when that that Library caught on fire
[7:26] and it burned down and uh you know all
[7:29] these historians and Scholars were so
[7:32] upset because all this ancient knowledge
[7:34] was lost and we kind of think uh well
[7:38] that's that's how my Christian
[7:40] experience should be I should have this
[7:42] whole library of knowledge inside of me
[7:44] but what about God living inside of you
[7:47] manifesting himself you can have that
[7:49] you can understand it all these books
[7:51] have all these books on your on the
[7:52] bookshelf of your mind but if it doesn't
[7:55] drop down in your heart and become
[7:56] manifest and live out through you then
[7:58] if it doesn't um that sorry sister back
[8:00] I don't mean to be staring at you I'm
[8:02] just picking somebody out
[8:10] oh
[8:11] so uh
[8:14] so uh
[8:15] not not just talking talking to talk but
[8:18] but living the life and though I bestow
[8:21] all my goods to feed the poor now this
[8:24] is a good one because because that's
[8:26] what most people think that charity is
[8:28] about going out and going to the soup
[8:30] kitchen and and uh feeding the poor and
[8:33] it is it is given to the poor let's
[8:36] let's look at that for a second that's a
[8:38] second later it's not it's not going out
[8:40] and doing good deeds it's not uh um
[8:44] you're trying to do a work like the well
[8:48] not to throw all of them but the
[8:49] Catholics you know they believe that uh
[8:51] that you teach that if you push a penny
[8:53] with your nose for a certain distance or
[8:54] walk up these steps on your knees and
[8:57] and or or in the Philippines you know
[8:59] how they'll Thrive until they're uh
[9:02] believing that that that is what their
[9:04] salvation is based on
[9:06] though I give my body to be burned I was
[9:09] I saw in the news the other day there
[9:11] was a fella in overseas a Buddhist monk
[9:14] that went out in the street because he
[9:15] was uh he uh
[9:20] he was fighting for but it was so
[9:23] important to him that he went out the
[9:24] street and dashed himself for gasoline
[9:25] and set himself on fire now that's an
[9:29] admirable thing to do that's that's
[9:31] wonderful but and I you know many many
[9:34] stories of people that have given their
[9:36] lives for a call they're giving their
[9:37] lives for I was reading a story last
[9:40] week about how these when the Chernobyl
[9:42] nuclear disaster there was three
[9:44] Engineers that gave their lives they
[9:46] Dove down into the nuclear waste and and
[9:48] to open up a valve so that the whole
[9:50] city would not be destroyed but they
[9:52] gave their lives for it but um now if
[9:54] you don't have something that's that's
[9:57] wonderful and those are wonderful Deeds
[9:58] but we we want to have an assurance the
[10:02] only assurance of of uh we need an
[10:06] eternal Insurance what this chapter is
[10:09] about they'll always throw all my
[10:11] goodness to feed the poor and though I
[10:13] give my body to be burned and have not
[10:14] charity it profiteth me nothing now what
[10:18] are all those people that swung down at
[10:19] the bottom of the
[10:20] yes sister
[10:27] you skip who I have all faith I had a
[10:31] question on that yeah yeah I'm gonna get
[10:33] to that because the last verse is is
[10:35] faith hope charity these three but the
[10:37] greatest of these is Charity why why is
[10:40] Charity the greatest
[10:42] so hold on a second
[10:46] it profits me nothing all right now
[10:48] charity suffered alone
[10:50] now let's hold on a sec before we uh
[10:53] keep moving I want to talk about what
[10:55] charity is and read a few scriptures
[11:02] now now some some say that you know love
[11:05] is is uh you know brother random told us
[11:08] that charity was love and and that it is
[11:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost God living
[11:12] inside of you
[11:14] um
[11:15] and and you know some people look at
[11:17] love charity is is uh universalism like
[11:20] it doesn't matter really what you do but
[11:23] um that you all should be we should
[11:26] embrace you and just pull you into the
[11:27] fold and that's that's actually where
[11:29] the World Council of churches is gonna
[11:31] end up everybody's we can all take
[11:33] Community together everything's it's all
[11:35] good uh just coming together in our
[11:37] circle of Fellowship but but real love
[11:39] it looks to satisfy God's requirements
[11:42] because real love only comes from God
[11:43] because that's what in the beginning God
[11:45] was a fountain of love
[11:47] he was he was the Fountain of love and
[11:49] if that same Fountain of Love is in you
[11:51] then it will try it will match up with
[11:53] his requirements and your desire will be
[11:55] according to his desire and
[11:58] um so it's not you can't have that kind
[12:01] of love and say what uh everybody come
[12:03] on in I I'll agree with whatever kind of
[12:06] of trash is rolling by
[12:09] um now
[12:11] when you say well well love should be
[12:13] real sweet and that is true but now you
[12:17] know Paul actually he named names and I
[12:20] was looking through some of the names
[12:21] that he named in first Timothy 2 20 he
[12:24] named hymenius and Alexander of philitus
[12:26] and he said you know how many is this
[12:28] how many US is denying the resurrection
[12:30] he said uh uh these people are leading
[12:35] you astray and what I means was doing
[12:38] this was he was preaching up this is
[12:40] this kind of ties into this Resurrection
[12:42] morning he was preaching that that uh
[12:44] when you get the new birth then then
[12:47] that is the resurrection now that is
[12:50] true in a way but uh we're looking for
[12:53] we're looking for a resurrection when
[12:54] the dead and Christ will rise and we go
[12:56] we go in to be with to be with Jesus
[12:59] where these these uh what the faith that
[13:01] we're looking for is made is made
[13:03] perfect it's swallowed up in Victory and
[13:06] uh
[13:07] and Paul named you know well you say
[13:10] well he named uh these unbelievers
[13:13] hymenius Alexander in philitus but then
[13:16] in uh Galatians chapter two I'm not I'm
[13:19] not advocating naming names or anything
[13:20] I'm just saying that what we what we
[13:22] might think of Love is is maybe not uh
[13:26] love is corrective and uh so Paul name
[13:30] in Galatians Chapter 2 he named Peter
[13:33] and Barnabas
[13:34] because you know Peter Peter was sitting
[13:36] Peter was sitting with the uh the Jews
[13:39] and and kind of making a little uh
[13:42] ostracizing the other believers trying
[13:44] to trying to put on theirs and say well
[13:46] I'm a I'm a Jew and going to sit down
[13:48] with with them instead of the the others
[13:51] and then he led Barnabas along with him
[13:53] so he he was leading Barnabas Along by
[13:56] his air and Paul corrected that
[13:59] um so what is love
[14:01] let's turn over to Matthew chapter 10
[14:04] verse 8.
[14:25] actually let's start by about verse five
[14:28] and read down to verse 8.
[14:32] these 12
[14:33] .
[14:35] yeah
[14:36] these two LG's are set forth and
[14:38] commanded them saying go not into the
[14:40] way of the Gentiles and into any city of
[14:42] the Samaritans enter you not and we're
[14:45] talking about charity now what is
[14:46] charity but go rather to the lost sheep
[14:49] of the House of Israel and as you go
[14:51] preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[14:54] at hand
[14:55] heal the sick
[14:57] cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast
[14:59] out devils
[15:01] freely ye have received free to give
[15:04] so it is giving it's giving to the poor
[15:07] giving to the ones that don't have
[15:09] anything spiritually
[15:10] it's not given a soup kitchen but now to
[15:13] have charity to give charity you first
[15:15] got to have it you gotta have it before
[15:17] you can give it out and and uh
[15:21] you so uh
[15:24] and you know you remember the in the Old
[15:27] Testament uh or let's see in
[15:30] when when the
[15:32] Paul and Silas were going to the gate
[15:34] beautiful they got there and said they
[15:36] said uh the baker was asking for money
[15:38] it didn't have any money
[15:41] but he said what I they said what I what
[15:43] we have will give to you what they had
[15:45] was the power of God being made manifest
[15:47] in their life not just a bunch of words
[15:51] not like in the verse verse one where he
[15:54] said though I speak with the tongues of
[15:56] men and of angels you can have all the
[15:58] words in in the world and speak but if
[16:01] the power of God is not living in your
[16:03] life that's that's what this is talking
[16:04] about charity and then when the power of
[16:06] God is in your life then you can give it
[16:09] out
[16:10] verse 4 charity suffereth alone
[16:14] in his kind
[16:16] now maybe a different way of reading
[16:17] this instead of reading charity is to
[16:19] put in the word Jesus
[16:21] Jesus suffers along
[16:24] and it's kind Jesus doesn't Envy
[16:27] he vulnerth not himself it is not puffed
[16:31] up
[16:32] does not behave itself unseemly
[16:35] seeketh not her own is not easily
[16:37] provoked thinketh no evil
[16:40] rejoiceth not in aniquely but rejoices
[16:44] in the truth
[16:47] and and then now if you have charity you
[16:49] can put your name in here that you
[16:52] suffer a long time now all of these all
[16:55] these attributes of Charity are are
[16:57] descriptive of
[17:00] you know when you when you read through
[17:01] the Bible and look at kind of uh from
[17:03] like almost a theological perspective of
[17:05] placing different things
[17:07] um that's wonderful but then when it
[17:09] really gets down when the rubber hits
[17:10] the road and you have to live it that's
[17:13] uh eat eat the book that's what becomes
[17:15] bitter when you got to live it now you
[17:18] can sit in your little study you know
[17:19] and well like I I said in my little my
[17:22] little prayer clause and and pray over
[17:24] and things to pray for things that I'm
[17:26] reading but then when you step your foot
[17:28] out of your house right that's when
[17:30] that's when things really become known
[17:35] see it charity suffereth long and it's
[17:38] kind charity envious not now think about
[17:41] these when you're dealing with your
[17:42] brothers and sisters and how how first
[17:44] how first God dealt with you that he
[17:47] suffered a long time with you while you
[17:49] were uh running around disbelieving his
[17:52] word and and then you can take his grace
[17:55] that he showed you and apply that to
[17:58] others you can now you got that charity
[18:00] and you can give it out charity
[18:02] suffereth along in his kind and chair
[18:04] doesn't envy and charity and phone with
[18:07] the knot itself is not puffed up like
[18:09] all these other things that Paul was
[18:11] talking about about knowledge out with
[18:14] man look out how much I've got all this
[18:16] library of information I've got look at
[18:18] look at all this thing all these things
[18:20] that I know and you know Paul even
[18:23] struggled with that he said because of
[18:25] the abundance of Revelation that I have
[18:27] God actually you know it was a great
[18:28] blessing that he gave me my thoughts
[18:30] because if he hadn't given him a thorn
[18:32] in the flesh then he might have uh uh
[18:36] gotten real big headed and everything
[18:38] because of all he knew
[18:40] but God knows how to deal with
[18:43] charity vote with the knot itself is not
[18:45] puffed up doesn't not behave itself
[18:48] unseen it knows how to act you know but
[18:52] we're going to talk about the people
[18:53] that would fall uh smitten in the spirit
[18:55] in in the Pentecostal meetings and then
[18:57] their dresses would fly up and things
[18:59] now God don't act that way God God knows
[19:02] how to say he's a gentleman he's very
[19:04] polite you know that's why uh in the
[19:07] church service you have to be very
[19:09] careful because God the holy spirit is
[19:11] so Meek that he won't come to a place
[19:13] that he's Uninvited so uh you know you
[19:15] definitely don't let our kids run around
[19:17] any sanctuary and uh you know eating
[19:20] bologna sandwiches in the back or uh
[19:22] just different things you know you have
[19:24] to be very respectful because think
[19:26] about those angels that uh cry holy holy
[19:29] holy in the temple now that and then
[19:31] somebody go running and do a cartwheel
[19:32] down through there those angels crying
[19:34] holy so we want to create an atmosphere
[19:36] not do anything unseemly
[19:39] seeketh not her own is not easily
[19:41] provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice is not
[19:46] an iniquity now that was what I was
[19:47] talking about with if the spirit of God
[19:49] is in you you're going to line up with a
[19:51] word you're not gonna uh well we can uh
[19:54] it'll be all right if we you know do a
[19:56] little a little bad thing or or get it
[20:01] get away away from the what we should be
[20:04] doing just for a little bit but Rejoice
[20:06] within the truth to beareth all things
[20:08] believeth all things hope with all
[20:11] things endureth all things
[20:13] now that's an odd way of Paul for Paul's
[20:16] saying but to sum up uh those four
[20:19] beareth all things believeth off they
[20:21] believe all things does that mean if
[20:24] somebody tells you alive you're just
[20:25] supposed to believe
[20:27] hope with all things endureth all things
[20:29] let me sum this up for you a Believer is
[20:33] an optimist
[20:35] that's what they're saying you look at
[20:37] somebody that's uh uh you know
[20:40] just hard to Bear but that that that
[20:43] spirit in you just the Bears with them
[20:46] and keeps on patience believeth all
[20:49] things somebody you know you you trust
[20:51] one another you know if brother Danny
[20:53] told me something I I'd believe him if
[20:55] you told me a fish was you caught was
[20:57] that big I'd you know I do my best to
[20:59] believe it
[21:07] hope with all things
[21:09] uh because hope is an expectation you're
[21:12] hoping you're looking at one another
[21:14] maybe uh somebody one of your family
[21:16] members that uh is is struggling to
[21:19] believe you're hoping you're expecting
[21:22] that one day they'll come to the to the
[21:24] knowledge that they'll they'll accept it
[21:26] you're hoping and and the same thing
[21:29] with us we're hoping we're expecting
[21:31] that one day we'll see him as he is face
[21:34] to face endureth all things charity
[21:38] never fail us but whether there be
[21:40] prophecies they shall fail whether they
[21:42] be tongues they shall see whether there
[21:44] be knowledge it shall vanish away now
[21:46] this is why true is it better than all
[21:49] these other things because if you put
[21:51] your faith in Prophecy or in in a gift
[21:55] of knowledge or a gift of wisdom those
[21:57] things could all pass away if you don't
[21:59] have that assurance and you that the the
[22:02] charity which is which is God in you
[22:05] charity never faileth but whether there
[22:07] be a problem they might they they shall
[22:09] fail to be tongues they shall cease
[22:12] but uh whether there be knowledge you
[22:14] shall banish your wife or we know in
[22:15] part and we prophesy in part but when
[22:18] that which is perfect he's come then
[22:20] that which is in part shall be done away
[22:22] now he's comparing these these gifts
[22:24] with a new birth and he's comparing
[22:27] where we are now in our spiritual
[22:28] journey with where we'll end up when we
[22:30] when we when we arrive in heaven all of
[22:33] these things that we see in part will be
[22:35] done away and we'll see everything in in
[22:38] profession but when that was just
[22:40] perfect just come to that which is in
[22:42] part shall be done away when I was a
[22:43] child I speak as a child I understood as
[22:45] a child I thought as a child but when I
[22:48] became a man
[22:49] I put away childish things for now we
[22:53] see through a glass darkling
[22:55] but then face to face now I know in part
[22:58] but then shall I know even as also I am
[23:00] known now the you know how the scripture
[23:03] says that the word of God isn't like a
[23:06] mirror that you can look in and examine
[23:07] your own life we look into this mirror
[23:09] of God's word and see all these
[23:11] representations in the Old Testament you
[23:13] know where they were well they went
[23:14] through the uh when they were eating the
[23:17] lamb and the before they took their
[23:19] Journey Through the Wilderness they
[23:21] probably didn't realize what was
[23:22] happening and so they were looking at
[23:25] looking into the glass Darkly they
[23:27] couldn't really
[23:29] perceive exactly what those
[23:31] representations meant what this
[23:33] showbread meant what The Mercy Seat
[23:36] meant all these different things but now
[23:38] things have become more clear and and
[23:40] even now we're still looking at things a
[23:43] little bit dark you know that we can't
[23:45] we can't fully comprehend the things
[23:47] that will comprehend when we get over
[23:48] there
[23:50] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[23:52] but then face to face now I know in part
[23:55] but then shall I know even as I is also
[23:57] I am known and now abideth faith hope
[24:00] charity these three but the greatest of
[24:03] these is charity and the greatest of
[24:05] these is Charity because
[24:09] Faith and Hope are looking for something
[24:13] faith is is a you know
[24:16] brother random always or in the all in
[24:20] the in the Bible faith hope and charity
[24:21] were always grouped together uh when uh
[24:25] when uh Jesus went to pray for jairus's
[24:28] daughter he told everybody get out
[24:29] except for Faith open charity Peter
[24:31] James and John because Peter James and
[24:33] John represent Faith open charity now he
[24:36] could you can believe for something
[24:37] faith and you can expect something to
[24:41] come but when charity comes it's there
[24:43] the charity is the love of God it's it's
[24:45] right there is that help answer
[24:55] I have all Faith so that I can
[24:58] I could remove mountains and it made me
[25:01] think of the denomination some people
[25:03] there they do have faith sure
[25:06] and then I got to thinking is that Faith
[25:09] any different from the faith we speak of
[25:12] over here
[25:15] because if they start right
[25:17] well now this is faith that comes from
[25:20] the new birth that's right that is our
[25:22] foundation based on a new birth you know
[25:25] that you can have faith for a time until
[25:26] you get that New Birth that that is the
[25:29] foundation stone so you know brother
[25:31] Brown talked about how you could have
[25:32] faith in your pocket knife would show up
[25:34] in your pocket and he said a lot of
[25:36] magicians and things will actually can
[25:38] actually do that they can believe that
[25:40] that you know a spoon will bend or
[25:42] different things they can and it will
[25:45] actually be in that's a type of thing
[25:47] because you know he said uh in prayer
[25:50] lines when a little girl with cross-eyed
[25:52] cross eyes would come up before him he
[25:54] said now my faith can uncross her eyes
[25:56] and he would say he would believe and
[25:58] her eyes wouldn't cross but then he
[26:00] would say now now her eyes will cross
[26:02] back but now watch when he comes on the
[26:04] scene her eyes will stay crossed
[26:06] uncrossed and God would come on the
[26:09] scene and uncross uncrossed out but by
[26:11] his faith he could move Ah that's that's
[26:14] uh that's pretty deep in this
[26:17] yeah that's pretty amazing and uh
[26:21] you know according to what she said it
[26:24] does say even though I have faith to the
[26:27] mountains which is another a person who
[26:30] does not have the new birth I think
[26:39] exactly right and uh you know we uh
[26:44] there was a testimony about a sister
[26:46] overseas that um that there was a
[26:49] mountain in the way of a school you know
[26:50] and they prayed and the bulldozers came
[26:53] and removed the mountain and uh now
[26:55] that's that takes Faith to believe that
[26:58] something will happen to that mountain
[27:00] but you can have that faith that
[27:02] justification sanctification but when
[27:04] you have that that Foundation Faith then
[27:07] then the uh you believe you begin to
[27:10] believe God's word everything against be
[27:12] put into place and you when you have
[27:15] that Faith you can't say well uh you
[27:18] know uh I'm not sure this Prophet was a
[27:21] you know what I'm saying like that I'm
[27:23] not sure
[27:24] that God really sent a prophet and
[27:26] different things like that
[27:27] I hope that's his requirements yeah
[27:31] you're right you'll meet his
[27:32] requirements
[27:33] now um
[27:38] I want to read one more let me find this
[27:40] this was really weird just to finish up
[27:44] foreign
[27:54] John chapter 21.
[27:56] because the the word of the shoes for
[27:58] charity and in First Corinthians 13 is
[28:01] agape which um
[28:06] you know uh brother Wade and different
[28:08] ones have brought out all the different
[28:10] Greek translations of
[28:13] the Greek word for love
[28:17] and there's agapo which is God's love
[28:20] and Ophelia which is the Earth is kind
[28:22] of love
[28:24] and I think this just kind of really
[28:27] this little conversation between Jesus
[28:29] and Peter just really drives home the
[28:31] difference
[28:33] now agapa was an eternal kind of love
[28:36] that you know by someone I can slap you
[28:38] in the face but it doesn't matter
[28:39] because that agape love is not
[28:41] conditional you could um
[28:44] it doesn't matter whether somebody
[28:46] returns that love or not that Agape of
[28:48] Love is giving so filio love is the love
[28:51] that it's just a natural Earthly Love
[28:53] Now verse 15 so when they had died Jesus
[28:57] saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas
[28:59] love us without me more than these and
[29:03] the word he uses loveth not me is agape
[29:06] and the Greek he's saying Agape Agape
[29:10] Simon son of Jonas love us love me more
[29:13] than these he saith unto me a lord thou
[29:15] knowest that I love thee but Philip uses
[29:17] the word
[29:18] filio filioce
[29:22] y'all know us that I love it he says
[29:24] unto him feed my Lambs he saith to him
[29:26] again the second time Simon says you
[29:28] almost love us thou me agapeless mate he
[29:31] said Lord thou knowest that I love thee
[29:34] he saith unto him feed my sheep
[29:36] now he's asked him two times do you
[29:38] Agape do you love me with that love
[29:41] that's unconditional it doesn't matter
[29:43] whether I love you back or whether
[29:44] somebody treats you just right and Peter
[29:47] keeps responding with the feeling of he
[29:50] said to him again the second time Simon
[29:52] son of Jonas loveth tell me say the name
[29:54] of yea Lord thou knowest that I love
[29:55] thee but he's not saying it the right
[29:57] way they say it unto him feed my sheep
[30:00] he's saying unto him the third time now
[30:01] this third time uh you can't see it in
[30:04] the English but in the Greek Jesus drops
[30:07] it down to feel him do you even love me
[30:09] with filio love
[30:11] Simon son of Jonas love us without me
[30:14] Peter was grieved because he said unto
[30:17] him the third time love us thou me
[30:19] philia with filio love and he said unto
[30:23] him the Lord thou knowest all things
[30:25] thou knowest that I love thee Jesus
[30:29] saith unto him feed my sheep so now when
[30:32] you have a real charity you know uh
[30:33] brother round told that little story
[30:34] about how your um your wife can meet you
[30:37] at the door when you come home and give
[30:39] you a kiss but is it just a kiss or is
[30:42] it is there something behind it is there
[30:44] a connection behind it and and he kind
[30:47] of talked about how that that's how the
[30:49] real charity love should be we we don't
[30:52] love God we don't take it set aside time
[30:54] uh to pray and and read our Bible and
[30:58] set aside time with him just to meet a
[31:01] requirement that maybe a deacon has said
[31:03] or something but because you really love
[31:05] God and that's what real charity is
[31:07] agape love not and Peter Peter couldn't
[31:10] Peter wasn't grasp on what Jesus was
[31:12] asking and uh maybe sometimes we don't
[31:16] quite grasp either but God wants us to
[31:18] love unconditionally with that Agape
[31:20] that only God can give by the new birth
[31:22] and let's stop right there
[31:25] thank you
[31:30] foreign
