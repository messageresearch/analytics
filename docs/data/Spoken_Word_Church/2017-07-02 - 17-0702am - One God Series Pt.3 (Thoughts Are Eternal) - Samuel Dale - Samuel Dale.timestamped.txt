[7:16] journey back to us that we can all be
[7:19] together in you we love you and we thank
[7:21] you and just have your way guide us now
[7:24] as we read your word you come and speak
[7:26] to us in Jesus name Amen
[7:33] John 1:1 is a very familiar scripture
[7:36] with us says in the beginning was the
[7:39] word and the Word was with God and the
[7:42] Word was God the same was in the
[7:44] beginning with God all the things were
[7:47] made by him who by the word all right
[7:51] and without him was not anything made
[7:53] that was made in him was life and the
[7:58] life was the light of men and light
[8:00] shyness and darkness and the darkness
[8:02] comprehended it not you may be seated or
[8:06] that is blessing to the reading of the
[8:08] word so we're down a lot of people are
[8:12] out visiting and going to counts and
[8:15] different things today but you know the
[8:18] Lord be with each and every one of them
[8:20] okay now we've been trying to speak on
[8:25] we started a little series or a thought
[8:28] of talking about God revealing himself
[8:33] or making himself known and to mankind
[8:37] because I believe that was the very
[8:41] purpose of the creation of man was the
[8:44] fact that God would want to reveal
[8:47] himself to the man that he
[8:49] created all right and it would take all
[8:51] of these years to unveil himself down to
[8:57] this very present hour that you and I
[9:00] are living to understand the one true
[9:04] and living God we spent a lot of time
[9:07] talking to to try to get everything
[9:09] right to where we don't believe in a
[9:11] Trinity and stuff like that because
[9:14] that's not even in the scriptures and
[9:16] then see you'd say well no man has seen
[9:19] God at any time but then the scripture
[9:21] says Jesus said if you've seen me he
[9:24] said you've seen the father well see now
[9:27] as those two scriptures contradictory
[9:31] one to the other
[9:32] all right now it just needs
[9:35] understanding and we were talking like
[9:37] not in the Bible study not Jordan where
[9:40] brother Branham said as far back as far
[9:43] back as the human mind can go is to go
[9:46] back to where it said in the beginning
[9:49] because that's you know even in the
[9:53] prophets said even in theology that's as
[9:56] far as I can go so you see why that I've
[9:58] constantly said that even the scholars
[10:03] and all the feathers ii go back in their
[10:07] thoughts is to say Elohim and they
[10:11] derive that as to the point of being
[10:13] self existing all right so then in that
[10:16] word Elohim we see that God was - making
[10:22] himself known and that's what he's been
[10:23] doing for all of these 6,000 years is
[10:26] unveiling himself to where we could
[10:29] understand but as far as we can go back
[10:31] in the human mind is to say in the
[10:34] beginning you know because it said in
[10:37] John we read in the beginning was the
[10:40] word it says in Genesis 1 you know in
[10:43] the beginning God created the heavens in
[10:45] error but that's as far as our human
[10:47] mind can comprehend but then the Prophet
[10:51] said we go then by revelation you know
[10:55] by further than just to say a beginning
[10:59] point because you know that would be the
[11:02] the place of going all right and in our
[11:05] studies we've talked about how that as I
[11:09] said God the great eternal one who
[11:11] covered all space-time and eternity all
[11:14] of the things you know that he was but
[11:17] he's been trying to reveal himself well
[11:21] he's not trying to reveal himself it's
[11:23] just some spirit yet we use that
[11:27] scripture Lee you know Scripture that
[11:29] God is a spirit well that's true your
[11:33] spirit the everybody in here is a
[11:36] different spirit that's just to say in a
[11:39] spirit part of it it's not defining each
[11:42] one of us have different natures ways
[11:45] and time because that is the point of us
[11:47] being spirit all right and God is the
[11:50] spirit but he's not to just say well
[11:52] he's just a spirit he just floating
[11:54] around we've been through that he's not
[11:56] at me after anything if he was just like
[11:59] the wind are floating around and now no
[12:01] form to him then he'd be a myth right
[12:05] in other words he'd be something you
[12:06] could try to think up but God is real he
[12:12] said well how do you know he's real are
[12:14] you real
[12:15] what would you mind reaching over and
[12:17] pinching yourself to see if you hurt
[12:20] what do you mean well that means you're
[12:23] real you're at least you're not dead if
[12:26] you can feel that within how much more
[12:28] real is the one who created all of this
[12:32] and much more real is God than what the
[12:36] creation is right sees in that we're
[12:40] trying to understand the eternal God by
[12:44] human words and that's hard to do it's
[12:48] hard to think about that before this
[12:51] world ever began for anything whatsoever
[12:55] existed that God existed alone because
[13:00] he was the self existing woman as your
[13:03] God is I've emphasized over and over how
[13:06] real is your God oh you want him do it
[13:10] you talk about him being a spirit
[13:14] but now Jesus said I and my father are
[13:17] one and he said if you sing me he said
[13:25] you've seen the father
[13:26] what well because we son always comes in
[13:30] the father's name right alright let's
[13:36] see then we know and believe that there
[13:38] is just one true and living God and that
[13:41] he's trying to reveal himself to the
[13:45] people that he created alright and as I
[13:48] said a minute ago each took six thousand
[13:50] years already
[13:51] so we see it unfolded down to where we
[13:53] are now we ought to be able to now think
[13:57] about how real God truly is and how he's
[14:03] not just a myth or a thought see there's
[14:05] people that teach it like that that God
[14:08] is the good thoughts you have and the
[14:11] devil is the bad thoughts you have well
[14:14] that's just that's according to who's
[14:17] who's on the thoughts you know that has
[14:20] no definition or thought to try to
[14:22] comprehend God we see the one who
[14:27] created us is trying to reveal himself
[14:30] to us that's his purpose that's what he
[14:34] was wanting to do in the beginning and
[14:36] man sinned and and broke away that
[14:39] understanding and all of these years
[14:41] he's been trying to restore that as I
[14:46] said we we talk about spirits within is
[14:51] that what we think God is really just a
[14:53] spirit we've heard that all of our lives
[14:56] that's been the thoughts of mankind why
[14:58] because that's the only thoughts mankind
[15:01] could have if you just say well God is
[15:06] the spirit well does he have any form to
[15:10] it
[15:11] just remember then the Bible said he
[15:16] created you in His image well
[15:24] kind of think we look like people what
[15:28] don't you think then that would be what
[15:29] he would look like what what are you
[15:33] wanting to look like you know what are
[15:37] your thoughts about God that's what I've
[15:39] encouraged you to to sit down and think
[15:42] or read the Word of God and study it to
[15:44] try to understand what easy to you it's
[15:48] not what he is to somebody else that's
[15:51] their part but what is he to you how
[15:55] real is your God now if we were 2,000
[16:02] years ago back see then we would look
[16:05] and see a man walking on the earth and
[16:10] his name is Jesus and we know that was
[16:12] real well why can't we believe that
[16:18] that's out real he is now and if we can
[16:22] realize that he is now real then my
[16:25] points been for weeks now is to get you
[16:28] to see if we can realize that he's real
[16:30] here then you realize he was just as
[16:32] real before the world and you realize
[16:34] he'll always be real this is not going
[16:39] to disappear let's get up to heaven one
[16:40] day and when we get tired there'll be a
[16:43] little thing over here to represent the
[16:45] father and little something over here
[16:46] for the son a little something over here
[16:48] for the Holy Ghost because Jesus would
[16:53] be wrong when he said if you see me he
[16:56] said you've seen the father see then
[17:00] what are we going to do when we get dire
[17:02] well I don't know I ain't worried about
[17:04] that I'm just worried about getting
[17:06] there
[17:06] well I you might wind up getting in the
[17:10] wrong place by your thoughts you say oh
[17:14] that's impossible no no we know I we see
[17:17] mankind always tried to make something
[17:20] to understand God why would not he want
[17:26] to think about him being real that to me
[17:28] is the first point no matter what
[17:32] religion you are or what you're talking
[17:34] about it our denomination or thoughts or
[17:37] whatever
[17:38] if God is not real than who are we I
[17:42] mean are we something more greater than
[17:45] he has no he created us all right
[17:52] he brought us into being all right then
[17:55] we ought to want to realize how real he
[17:57] is the Bible calls him our Savior our
[18:02] healer our Father our leader our
[18:05] advocate
[18:06] he's the Rose of Sharon and lily of the
[18:09] valley the bright morning star the Alpha
[18:11] and Omega you got tons of statements
[18:17] made throughout the Bible to try to get
[18:20] us to understand him what you see that
[18:23] was the problem that was covering the
[18:25] other way then why did they kill Jesus
[18:30] they were looking for a messiah though
[18:35] they had read the word and studied the
[18:37] word they are today that you today is
[18:40] looking for the Messiah but he just
[18:44] didn't come to way that they saw do to
[18:47] come who could it would be that way
[18:50] today could we be trying to worship
[18:53] something that is really not a reality
[18:56] to you and I know no brother till I
[19:00] worship Jesus I know who he is you know
[19:04] like always illustrate we say oh I know
[19:06] the presence of God because it's sweet
[19:09] and it's wonderful that's true but what
[19:15] if he comes in correction to talk to you
[19:19] you might not be too sweet it might be a
[19:23] little Stern he might tell you to sit
[19:24] down and shut up right but see we think
[19:29] we've got it all figured out
[19:33] but what would happen if God walked
[19:36] among us right now how would you know
[19:38] him well we said well with we'd see him
[19:46] cause he looks like Hoffman
[19:49] true that's the point no but how would
[19:54] you know that that is real and not some
[19:58] thought of your mind or something
[20:00] because he Satan can give you thoughts
[20:02] and ideas what is it then what do you
[20:09] think about God how real and I keep
[20:15] making that statement how real is your
[20:17] God well we can't understand them
[20:22] defense what's deep about understanding
[20:24] God he spent six thousand years trying
[20:29] to get us to understand him he's
[20:34] appeared in many forms in many ways then
[20:38] he appeared in flesh see now that same
[20:43] God is supposed to be living in you and
[20:46] I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost well
[20:51] then why would we not believe that he's
[20:54] a real person you have a person that
[20:57] just makes it to - you're trying to get
[21:00] it - tangible I went to God I could get
[21:03] it tangible enough - we could believe it
[21:05] that's my goal that's my daughter's to
[21:08] preach God enough until we could see and
[21:12] know who he is what he looks like
[21:15] his nature his ways is doings and
[21:19] understand it but how would you know him
[21:23] the only way you could know him is
[21:25] whether or not he's courting - the word
[21:27] well what if you don't know the word -
[21:34] what if you don't know the word how are
[21:39] you going to know God now go out to the
[21:43] world today and ask them about God and
[21:45] what do they got him a God in three
[21:47] persons Blessed Trinity co-equals in Co
[21:50] eternal there's no such thing that ain't
[21:52] even human thinking how could you have
[21:55] God in three persons personality a
[22:00] person - personality personality
[22:02] individual individual two-person so that
[22:05] means you got three gods whatever you're
[22:07] saying I know I know educational got a
[22:09] little since these in is he just one of
[22:14] those persons how real is your God and
[22:23] what do you think about him and what
[22:25] he's trying to do we're trying to stay
[22:31] back before the foundation is why we
[22:34] keep reading John one and going back
[22:37] into God's mind enough to be able to
[22:40] understand him to be able to comprehend
[22:44] what's taking place I thought the whole
[22:48] purpose of the Bible was to reveal God I
[22:50] thought the whole purpose of life
[22:53] everything was to understand God and be
[22:57] able to fellowship with him see then as
[23:04] we think about it it says that in the
[23:06] beginning was the word as we were
[23:11] discussing this life not when you use
[23:14] that word in the beginning you're
[23:17] signifying a starting point of something
[23:20] no matter what you're dealing with oh
[23:23] there was a time that he wasn't married
[23:28] you got married your wedding and you had
[23:32] a beginning in your marital situation
[23:36] right so there's many beginnings it just
[23:42] simply means that you're trying to
[23:44] define a starting point when you say in
[23:47] the beginning so in the beginning was
[23:51] the word all right I see then what was
[23:55] it before it was word me
[24:03] do you not agree that God had thoughts
[24:11] do you not agree according we try to get
[24:14] to it after a while that all names it
[24:17] was to be written would be written in
[24:18] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[24:19] foundation of the world we see we don't
[24:24] give God that credit to understand that
[24:27] he would know every person and ever be
[24:29] in this world and would be able to know
[24:31] their name their personalities what they
[24:34] are and then go further than that to
[24:37] know everne at that would ever be in the
[24:40] world and every time that and that would
[24:42] bat it's off you mean your God doesn't
[24:48] know that much then you don't believe
[24:52] he's infant and we were given that life
[24:55] star Wednesday night see then the word
[24:57] infinite cannot be defined in human
[24:59] terminologies how can you understand in
[25:04] human terminologies what infinite means
[25:07] it just means no beginning no end no
[25:11] connection to life
[25:12] nothing to control it nothing to have
[25:18] anything to do with it it's infinite how
[25:22] can we understand that but we'd have to
[25:25] agree God is and four there or what is
[25:27] your God you mean your God doesn't know
[25:32] all things what about our thoughts in
[25:36] heaven being lighter than their words on
[25:38] earth you know we run our mouth a lot
[25:41] what about what in that God would know
[25:44] those thoughts before the world ever
[25:45] becoming will you try to make God real I
[25:53] want him to stay a spirit I wanted to
[25:57] say there's something you know that I
[25:58] can just take about I want him to say
[26:01] something that's not real no I want him
[26:03] real I mean the old ending at least he's
[26:09] got the totem-pole rasa at least he
[26:14] won't something real
[26:18] any any religion as you find you know
[26:24] it's got some kind of an image you
[26:25] remember Paul on Mars Hill and he comes
[26:28] up and they got all of these different
[26:29] things to represent all of their
[26:31] religious beliefs and gods and then they
[26:34] got one setting over there there's just
[26:37] in case they missed you know so they've
[26:41] got a little thing set in our box we
[26:42] call it and it says the unknown God well
[26:48] that would be to mean that means to me
[26:51] you know this is just in case that
[26:54] there's one more left over see in India
[26:57] brother Christ will tell you they got
[26:58] like three million gods and goddesses
[27:03] with each one of them's got an image or
[27:05] a thought or an idea a concept they said
[27:10] in the Indian he makes a totem pole this
[27:14] one worships this animal this worship
[27:16] that animal they put that animal on a
[27:18] you know on a symbol point to work the
[27:21] tur belief and they believe their God is
[27:24] real but yet we religious people we just
[27:26] want them two steps period we don't want
[27:29] him as I said Wednesday are we scared of
[27:32] him are we scared to think that God
[27:38] could come down and dwell with us is it
[27:43] that we don't want him to come down we
[27:48] wanted to set spirit and like I've
[27:51] always said and I don't make light of
[27:52] nobody's religious belief but sometimes
[27:55] it would be a pretty good thought to
[27:57] have a Trinity a Father Son and Holy
[27:59] Ghost because somewhere in between there
[28:01] he might lose me and forget about all of
[28:04] my doings
[28:05] he said that's carnal that's right but
[28:08] it's it gets your point across don't it
[28:11] it would be nice some time to think that
[28:14] one of these three was taking care of me
[28:16] the word that I didn't have to answer
[28:19] before God as long as you keep him in
[28:23] the spirit realm I don't understand that
[28:25] that's that's my point
[28:29] to me
[28:30] to make God a spirit realm would be
[28:34] greater than all of the physical rooms
[28:36] you could make because he would be your
[28:40] very thought he would be everything if
[28:44] he's just the spirit he's just floating
[28:46] right but when you try to bring him down
[28:48] to the human looking race and we think
[28:55] that our little there was little God
[28:57] little Emmanuel laying in a cradle
[29:01] crying
[29:02] laying in a cradle do we believe that
[29:06] was God the Bible said it was no but see
[29:13] we come up with a smart aleck smaller
[29:15] but but who was running the world while
[29:17] he was laying there as a baby see we
[29:20] thought over what we strayed that out
[29:21] didn't Lee we're smart we straightened
[29:25] that one out who runs the world right
[29:27] now when he's over here over though only
[29:30] I do speak knows it he just spoke at one
[29:35] time in world's gonna run till he gets
[29:37] ready to stop it because that's his word
[29:41] do you understand what you see like
[29:45] holding up a papers but brother Dale I
[29:48] get the idea to you you believe God is
[29:52] real I believe he's a whole lot more
[29:56] real than piece of paper I've got here
[29:59] what about you I kind of like what the
[30:05] old boy said I when it comes to time of
[30:08] troubles you know I like a God with skin
[30:10] them when troubles start coming my way
[30:15] I don't want to try to deal with no
[30:17] spirit to wonder about it because it
[30:20] might even but if I can realize how
[30:22] close he is to me mean God's close to
[30:27] you will mark woe to scripture I'll be
[30:33] with you all way
[30:37] it doesn't say always because he ain't
[30:40] going to go into a sinful situation with
[30:43] us he's going to stay out and let us do
[30:47] what we're doing
[30:47] so it's alway it doesn't say always
[30:50] there he said I'll be with you always
[30:53] which means I'll be with you from here
[30:56] to there always and I'll be there when
[31:00] I'm needed but I look it I like that
[31:02] idea
[31:02] I like the idea of a god that's real you
[31:09] teach your children a spooky story of
[31:12] Santa Claus when you ask what he is well
[31:17] he's just the spirit now you got the
[31:21] children thinking about God just being a
[31:23] spirit and they can see Santa on the
[31:27] corner it might be like one of the guys
[31:32] over and Guilds with our one time he he
[31:35] was you know working being Santa Claus
[31:37] up in Gainesville and he was sitting in
[31:40] a little igloo you know the kids have
[31:42] come in and said on his knee and his
[31:46] little son came to to see Santa College
[31:49] well he walks into the igloo and he
[31:52] looks and he says daddy what you doing
[31:56] in here
[31:58] he seen his shoes and he knew that was
[32:01] his daddy he said daddy what are you
[32:04] doing in here well I pulled a little kid
[32:06] to wrestler life what do you think about
[32:10] what you see I'm trying to get you not
[32:13] to think about how real God really is
[32:16] that's my whole goal that's always been
[32:19] out my Romola that's been my goal back
[32:21] when I was in the badness Neverland
[32:23] I wanted to know about God I wasn't able
[32:28] to go get an education to get a scholary
[32:31] degree out of something so all I could
[32:34] do was just sit down and read God's Word
[32:36] I read it and I read it I read it then I
[32:42] heard this message and this message
[32:44] brought the God that I believed in
[32:49] I couldn't explain it I had to explain
[32:53] it like we taught it God in three
[32:54] persons Blessed Trinity but I knew
[32:57] better than a lot of the things that men
[32:59] come taught about him I knew better than
[33:04] that then why because the word didn't
[33:06] declare that you think I can quote
[33:09] scriptures now I could quote almost into
[33:12] our Bible back then because that's all I
[33:14] studied I didn't come into this message
[33:19] to learn that God in Christ are one we
[33:22] already knew that by the scriptures but
[33:25] we just didn't have the right
[33:28] understanding to occur it all the way
[33:30] well why not now you mean you don't
[33:35] believe God is more real today than you
[33:38] did 50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years
[33:41] ago there's something wrong way if your
[33:44] God is not getting more real to you it's
[33:47] not to understand him it's not to know
[33:50] all about that no it's to believe it I
[33:55] don't understand how a brown cow eats
[33:59] green rice and use white milk I don't
[34:04] understand that there's no mechanical
[34:07] situation to explain that but that don't
[34:12] mean I'm gonna stop drinking me up I
[34:14] don't care what's a brown cow or green
[34:17] care or blue cow or what color the
[34:19] callee is it don't change the milk well
[34:23] why are we not like that with God and
[34:25] our thinking see if you don't believe
[34:30] God is real then who come and died for
[34:33] your sins who died for our sins 2,000
[34:41] years ago on a tree I think he must have
[34:45] been pretty real don't you if we'd have
[34:49] been dire we realize I really was
[34:51] because they beat him and they've done
[34:53] all the things and hung him on a tree
[35:01] why don't we believe God to be that real
[35:04] now then it'll do away with all of that
[35:09] thoughts in your mind or that God don't
[35:14] understand everything's taking place
[35:16] have you ever noticed it this is one of
[35:18] my happenings in my life I guess one of
[35:23] my pet peeves you thought you ever
[35:27] thought about when you're praying how
[35:29] you tried to explain to God just in case
[35:36] you don't know it Lord yes come on
[35:43] the minute you'll start giggling because
[35:45] you realize that I don't hit you in the
[35:47] head with it we all tried to explain to
[35:50] God what the problem is right and then
[35:56] we really can't understand when a
[35:58] prophet would come and say why don't you
[36:01] sometimes you're set down there and sit
[36:03] still and listen and let him talk to you
[36:09] but we're always trying to explain
[36:12] everything especially we get into any
[36:15] trouble with somebody or something we
[36:17] try to explain to the Lord why we've
[36:19] done that you don't do that when our
[36:25] Lord you know my heart and you know I
[36:28] didn't have any any ill feelings against
[36:31] that brother or sister you're trying to
[36:34] explain to an eternal God who knows ever
[36:37] thought and ever reason for doing those
[36:39] things and you're trying to win your
[36:41] peanut brain to explain to him
[36:50] you might be fine sometimes they sit
[36:53] down shut up listen listen I told you
[36:56] over and over I do that sometimes I'll
[36:58] get up and I'll pray and then I just
[37:00] said to her you don't ever think about
[37:02] communicating communicating is to people
[37:06] talking we talk to him all the time but
[37:11] we ever listened to him talk you know
[37:18] what he might say something to us that
[37:21] we think he's not even God himself
[37:23] talking to them but what we going to do
[37:26] how real is your God when he's just the
[37:33] spirit
[37:39] but he's supposed to be becoming more
[37:41] real to us each day of our lives
[37:46] the base is that we can come down to see
[37:50] how real God truly is and to realize
[37:56] that we can talk to it have you ever
[38:04] called the Lord up on the telephone and
[38:07] found out he give you a busy signal you
[38:10] know what I mean
[38:11] have you ever prayed and you talked to
[38:15] you prior didn't get through because
[38:16] maybe the Lord was tied up somewhere
[38:18] because if not what are you going to
[38:20] explain it he's never done things never
[38:26] busy he's never he knows the prior
[38:31] before you ever pray it well I still
[38:34] have to pray then now you're in
[38:36] carnality and really got it going good
[38:38] that you don't have to pray Jesus said
[38:42] one day said look at the feel of the
[38:44] harvest hour he was the god of the
[38:46] harvest right and what did he say
[38:48] you pray but the lord of the harvest
[38:50] which he was will send workers into the
[38:52] field you pray god loves to hear our
[39:00] prayers but sometimes he wants us to
[39:04] shut up and listen to him
[39:11] well I just I've never heard from God
[39:14] why don't you try reading his word why
[39:21] don't you try reading the Bible like
[39:24] this that that's God speaking to me
[39:33] you don't think about the Bible like
[39:35] that but that's God speaking to you well
[39:41] I don't know I don't know and I said now
[39:43] like you said a minute ago then and
[39:45] there's many voices and never speak
[39:48] contrary to the words that's how you
[39:51] know whether it's the voice of God or
[39:53] not he'll always pick a quarter word but
[39:56] you better know the word you don't know
[39:59] the word how do you know what he said
[40:03] come on be human with me I'd like to be
[40:07] with you I have set down a many a time
[40:10] and I have read chapter after chapter
[40:15] after chapter in the Bible and get up
[40:21] and walk away not having any thoughts or
[40:26] whatever that God was speaking to me in
[40:31] other words not getting nothing is that
[40:33] a better word or saying in few human
[40:35] mind it's not getting anything but then
[40:42] I've been walking around or doing
[40:44] something or being at work or something
[40:46] being just all kind of things taking
[40:48] place and all at once here it comes and
[40:52] he speaks to you like I've always told
[40:59] you the prophet of God I love the way I
[41:01] love to express it the way he said son
[41:03] he said a minister is nothing in the
[41:05] world but a gift from God
[41:08] to try to break Satan's spell over your
[41:11] eyes some of your wondering what you're
[41:13] going to have for dinner some of your
[41:15] wondering did you leave the iron on at
[41:16] home some of you wondered it just happen
[41:19] or does that happen you got all kind of
[41:20] thoughts what am I going to do tomorrow
[41:22] and we're gonna have a fourth and we're
[41:24] going to do this with you know what I
[41:31] get tickled at when I say that a lot of
[41:34] you grin because that's what you're
[41:36] doing
[41:36] we ever thought about the word is a
[41:39] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[41:43] the heart
[41:45] you ever thought about we're reading the
[41:48] Bible will discern out what we are no
[41:52] it's got to be a profit on the word
[41:55] comes to the profit I'm talking about
[41:58] reading the Bible to understand that God
[42:02] is speaking to you let's see what we
[42:08] want to do is like brother tell him I
[42:09] used to get tickled with him come you
[42:11] know like when we first started hearing
[42:13] of the word and he knew about and had
[42:16] heard about water baptism you know
[42:17] believe it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:20] Christ instead of the Father Son and
[42:21] Holy Ghost that we were taught all of
[42:23] our lives and he said he used to read
[42:26] that and he'd get over to acts 2 and he
[42:28] said I just turned over real quick he
[42:33] didn't want to read out why it was
[42:36] condemning him he knew something was
[42:39] wrong
[42:40] what about all of the Word of God why
[42:43] can't we believe God is speaking to us
[42:45] no he was speaking to them back tyre see
[42:49] now that's the same thing as you said
[42:50] God is a spirit / benevolence some work
[42:52] and nothing realities to us he's just
[42:55] floating around he did mm-hmm he's right
[42:59] here he's right here with us all the
[43:04] time okay we believe it like you want to
[43:10] know what God wants to say to you why
[43:12] don't you read the Bible you know what
[43:17] you might find out he's talking to you
[43:21] you know there's things in the Bible if
[43:23] we would believe it you know it didn't
[43:25] change because of anything hell we were
[43:27] talking about it life's not on the basis
[43:29] and at home I think but when the Bible
[43:31] says says you'll be there with your
[43:34] offspring well you know what I read that
[43:39] one day and it jumped off the pages into
[43:41] my heart it was no longer letters on a
[43:45] page that just said you'll be there with
[43:47] your offspring it was God speaking to me
[43:53] and when they did I've set right there
[43:54] and claimed all of my children I don't
[43:56] care what you do I don't mean that wrong
[43:59] now I don't care what you do I do
[44:01] but you ain't gonna never get away from
[44:03] you need to get away from what he's
[44:05] called if he's called you and then I've
[44:08] had people to try to explain that to me
[44:11] sue because you know I'd say well I took
[44:13] that claim and I believe wait without in
[44:14] the world and sin and I would come right
[44:18] here to the pulpit and say you do what
[44:19] you want to he's coming
[44:23] the Lord has shown being wife that he's
[44:26] coming he's coming and then one day I
[44:29] walked into her and I said there's more
[44:30] of the story now she said what I said
[44:32] he's not now this is before he ever came
[44:34] back to the Lord I said how do you know
[44:36] the story I said not only wait coming
[44:40] back but he's going to be a minister and
[44:43] the pulpit with me
[44:45] well he didn't know it and he wouldn't
[44:49] like for me to told him that when I
[44:51] forbid my wife to tell it and we never
[44:53] told nobody until wait come back to the
[44:55] Lord and still didn't tell him
[44:57] I guess so tickle I fight about brother
[45:00] Gary Atkins you know he'd say roses
[45:04] elder the Lord tell you in Zion saying
[45:06] okay and she'll tell you when it's
[45:10] supposed to be or something like that
[45:11] we just know it wasn't comical but with
[45:14] just a point I told him something happen
[45:19] was going to happen one day he said why
[45:21] didn't you tell me that before I said I
[45:23] couldn't do I said God didn't fluence
[45:26] you the way it would turn out so had to
[45:28] let you do it
[45:29] treadle that way go Junie will tell you
[45:33] I would look at her and say he's got a
[45:37] hard road to hoe
[45:38] I said he's coming but he's got a hard
[45:41] road to hoe I can't help him hold the
[45:43] road me so why don't you claim your
[45:48] family like that out of a scripture then
[45:51] I've had people to try to explain to
[45:53] them and say well do you think every one
[45:56] of your children
[46:01] why would I want to leave one out what
[46:06] would be the purpose of leaving one out
[46:08] well we're human beings one of your kids
[46:11] might belong to the neighbor so you got
[46:13] your child
[46:13] I've had people to tell me stuff like
[46:15] that trying to ditch then you know just
[46:18] discourage me about the word when I
[46:22] don't give a hoot if every one of them
[46:23] belong to the neighbor you know what I
[46:26] mean the neighbor be every one of them
[46:29] daddy I claim them for my children why
[46:31] can't you claim your family that away
[46:37] Willie might not be mine I'd be claiming
[46:40] somebody else's children
[46:41] oh you Urschel crime why don't you
[46:47] believe God you know that's our problem
[46:52] he'll speak to us and we don't believe
[46:53] him well my brother Dale maybe maybe two
[46:59] thirds of your family will be safe he
[47:02] didn't tell me that so I have no right
[47:05] to speak that he said you'll be there
[47:09] with your offspring
[47:10] has he ever spoke to you personal well
[47:13] why don't you believe it what did you
[47:15] listen when I told you before too that
[47:18] it was a situation years ago and boy I
[47:20] was down and out and I was crying and
[47:23] just old man I was gonna be I had a big
[47:25] big old period that we called P party I
[47:29] was havin me a great one I was crying
[47:31] and praying there one Ellen I Drive out
[47:33] to the road and I think it was waiter
[47:35] Terrence wanted to then so he going on
[47:37] something that's going driving I'll be
[47:40] back and I started to Maysville and I
[47:43] was going down the road and I was crying
[47:45] out to God how bad everything was and I
[47:49] was telling him how rough it was I was
[47:51] explaining to him what was going on and
[47:54] about that time he stopped me and he
[47:59] said who do you think you are and what
[48:04] do you think's going on do you think
[48:07] your little pity party is worse and I
[48:10] went through for you to get you where
[48:13] you are
[48:14] I turned around I was crying more coming
[48:20] back up the road but it was joy in my
[48:23] heart
[48:23] to realize that he was not there with me
[48:26] in that trouble and he'd work it out why
[48:32] can't we believe God is real like that
[48:36] brother branham I'm not the one it made
[48:38] these statement he said God allow some
[48:40] people to see things where he's
[48:41] explaining to other people you've heard
[48:44] me over my testimony for many of the
[48:46] years and I've seen a lot of things
[48:47] happen I've had a lot of things to
[48:49] happen a lot of supernatural things to
[48:52] happen but that supernatural is not
[48:55] going to get you anywhere you gotta have
[49:01] it it's got to be real to you God has
[49:05] got to be real to you not real to your
[49:06] daddy your mama water you know he's got
[49:08] to be real to you
[49:17] he's got to be to work it's your God
[49:24] it's not your daddy's God I've never
[49:28] said my kids would be saved because they
[49:30] were my children I've never said that
[49:33] you think I did want to go no they're
[49:35] going to have their own salvation that's
[49:38] what I mean they may have a rough road
[49:42] and a hard time but they're going to
[49:45] have their own salvation some worry is
[49:48] going to get them it may be in the bed
[49:49] somewhere land flat on their back that's
[49:51] weight about it help this one probably
[49:54] back in the times and all of the kids in
[49:56] times you know always was healthy but
[49:58] then one day he was hunting mom and
[50:02] daddy
[50:02] the only day we didn't take the
[50:04] telephone the end of the old cabin up in
[50:06] the mountains we'd always take her cell
[50:08] phone we didn't have a landline we take
[50:10] her cell phone in was working on the
[50:12] cabinet we had up there
[50:13] and he comes down with symptoms of a
[50:16] heart attack and he's trying to find us
[50:22] why because he believes in our priors
[50:28] then he turns around and he said when
[50:30] the Horde I guess I can't find them
[50:32] coming between me and them and you
[50:33] anywhere between me and him Lord all
[50:36] right that's what God wanted that's the
[50:39] way he wanted to get in touch with him
[50:41] he wanted something real
[50:42] he wanted to him to real I realize how
[50:45] really is what about you admit I know it
[50:52] that some people never had great
[50:54] experiences of things why not take or
[50:59] what a little bit you got you might find
[51:03] out you got a whole lot when you sit
[51:06] down and analyze things and think about
[51:08] it and where you are and where he's
[51:11] brought you and what you're doing who
[51:15] took care of you and all them car wrecks
[51:18] and all of this that in the early or all
[51:19] the things around you that could have
[51:21] blown you to pieces and all the things
[51:23] that could have happened you don't ever
[51:27] think about how he you don't ever
[51:34] consider I really you don't never think
[51:43] about that you're eager God he's your
[51:45] Savior he's all and all and if he's not
[51:49] reeling one thing that he's not reeling
[51:51] in right if he's not real of this part
[51:57] of him being real then maybe he's not
[51:59] real here maybe this is just a story
[52:02] maybe this is a standing clothes idea
[52:07] maybe after all these 2000 years it's
[52:10] just somebody thinking good or whatever
[52:13] trying to make people want to act good
[52:17] you know if I was the ruler of America
[52:22] as a ruler or one part I'd want
[52:24] everybody in America to be Christians
[52:29] you know why go dr. trust all of them
[52:33] they'll have to worry about the rest of
[52:34] it
[52:35] they're all a bunch of crews I got
[52:36] problems with it what if they're all
[52:38] true Christians we'd have a wonderful
[52:41] world that's how real I think God is
[52:50] that's that's the point of how really is
[52:56] and you realize before not just a minute
[52:59] of the thoughts and we'll quit you
[53:03] realize that back before this world ever
[53:05] begun that God existed don't you believe
[53:08] it anyway whatever form you want to put
[53:11] it in a spook or a floater our cloud or
[53:14] whatever you want to make it don't you
[53:16] realize that God is real and that he was
[53:20] real before the world ever started or
[53:22] did he have some kind of beginning what
[53:32] done don't you realize that before this
[53:34] world ever begun we read it in Genesis I
[53:36] mean read it in John in the beginning
[53:38] was the word
[53:40] now that's far as you can go back
[53:42] because you back up to Genesis 1 and it
[53:45] says God created the heavens and the
[53:46] earth so that's as far as you can go
[53:49] humanly speaking well what was it before
[53:54] it was ordered
[54:00] you don't think about God before this
[54:02] world every begun that he knew ever not
[54:05] everything that would ever take place in
[54:06] this world he knows why you do
[54:09] everything you're doing never thought
[54:11] ever idea because he was dwelling along
[54:16] with this talk he hasn't spoken
[54:21] he's dwelling along with his thoughts
[54:23] that's his attributes that says he just
[54:26] hired to be a savior a healer or a
[54:28] redeemer he desired all of those things
[54:31] but he dwells alone but you know what
[54:35] once he spoke the word he'll never dwell
[54:37] alone again I love that I may die and go
[54:40] to hell I may do everything in the world
[54:41] but for me to realize that there's some
[54:44] connection of a human beings that we
[54:47] have that some way we are the products
[54:50] of what God desired for us to be we are
[54:56] his offspring and those thoughts are
[55:04] eternal God Cain how when you thought he
[55:10] came that one thing today and something
[55:12] tomorrow that's us he can't do that
[55:15] his thoughts are eternal and a part of
[55:19] him like the Prophet said it's not like
[55:21] a blueprint see you build a building
[55:24] you're going to do something house or
[55:25] something you go get a blueprint made up
[55:27] and you get everything put in place and
[55:29] you you do all that and then you go
[55:30] build a house it's not that away with
[55:33] God he didn't have to have no blueprint
[55:40] in his thoughts he knew what he's going
[55:43] to do is it simple that he would think
[55:53] about what he's going to do
[55:54] how may I say it and this will form for
[55:57] you to think about if there is a God I
[56:00] like to say it that way cuz I like to
[56:03] leave it in your lap for you to think
[56:05] about God not at me I'm not concerned
[56:08] it's already settled but if there is a
[56:11] God you mean to tell me you don't think
[56:13] that
[56:14] God would be capable of understanding
[56:15] all things then what kind of a god have
[56:19] you God you've got a total Pole
[56:21] you got something of mankind in these
[56:23] thoughts and ideas to try to make you an
[56:27] imagination in your mind to make you a
[56:29] better person or better this or better
[56:32] that or some worship idea but what about
[56:39] God's thoughts God's thoughts are
[56:44] eternal now what he thinks of is not
[56:47] always eternal cuz he thought of what we
[56:50] really thought of this he thought of
[56:51] that in this it comes into being but
[56:54] what about I don't want to stay on just
[56:56] add I want to see his thoughts I've
[57:01] always said it this way I don't want to
[57:04] be just a thought in his mind cuz he
[57:07] told you to said scary and what he would
[57:10] do am i right
[57:12] he thought of Judas Iscariot and how he
[57:15] would be the one to do what he done
[57:19] selling my house well I don't want to be
[57:22] just a thought in his mind when I
[57:27] brought it was wonderful be just think
[57:29] about just being a thought in God's mind
[57:31] that's not good enough for me that might
[57:34] settle it for you but he might have
[57:37] thought I like what brother Branham said
[57:42] he went into beyond the curtain of time
[57:46] right it saw the people but he also went
[57:50] to the regions of the law and saw people
[57:52] he saw all of you there he said now
[57:54] which word DC oh whoa no no no there's
[58:01] another that's it that's where you're
[58:03] gonna lose me you might have seen you
[58:07] definitely
[58:12] did we got to find out which ways
[58:13] thinking is I doubt what kind of a God
[58:18] do you serve I don't want to be what he
[58:23] thought of now here's the answer to it I
[58:28] want to be part of the thinker right do
[58:35] you understand the difference in being
[58:36] what God would think of that he would
[58:39] think of the world he think of the
[58:40] people and think he'd have to destroy me
[58:42] think of Hell he's got to do this he'd
[58:44] have to do that he would think of all of
[58:45] those things and how he'd blow this
[58:47] world apart so you do all of the
[58:49] different time and Judas and what he
[58:52] would do but what about being part of
[58:56] the thinker
[58:59] maybe that strange language to you but
[59:03] it just simply means why don't you think
[59:05] about you being part of God he gave you
[59:09] his own life the new birth salvation he
[59:14] gave you his own life right the
[59:19] scripture said his Christ in you the
[59:20] hope of glory the Bible said we were
[59:24] chosen in him before the foundation of
[59:27] the world chosen in him it didn't say
[59:32] chosen of him because that makes it like
[59:34] he's gonna pick this one and leave that
[59:36] one but it's chosen in him why can't we
[59:42] think about our salvation and our lives
[59:45] and and knowing that Jesus Christ come
[59:48] and paid the price for you and I but to
[59:50] know that we're part of that when it
[59:53] done to thinking in it that's a whole
[59:56] lot of difference and it being a part of
[59:58] what he thought of it to be a part of
[1:00:01] him to vary him himself may I quote
[1:00:05] brother branham he said God gave Moses a
[1:00:10] thought now watch him he said it ain't
[1:00:16] word yet now come on I can quote all
[1:00:21] right What did he say
[1:00:25] he said it ain't word yet he said he
[1:00:27] gave Moses to thought he said it was
[1:00:30] Moses his talk but he said then Moses
[1:00:34] poking it become words well what if he's
[1:00:38] waiting on you and I better way you know
[1:00:45] what if his come I thought we were
[1:00:49] supposed to come out to adoptions from
[1:00:51] designs you know speaking the word I
[1:00:53] thought that I thought that 50 years ago
[1:00:55] and I still think it today that I
[1:00:57] believe it but what he's waiting on you
[1:01:03] and me
[1:01:10] knowing and realizing that God is real
[1:01:13] is not all your salvation
[1:01:19] don't save you just because you know God
[1:01:21] is real salvation is when you accept
[1:01:26] Jesus Christ as your Savior and realize
[1:01:31] how really is and then when he accepts
[1:01:34] you is your salvation that's why the
[1:01:37] world is like it is so you've got a lot
[1:01:39] of confessions you've got a lot of
[1:01:40] people go to the altar I confessed my
[1:01:43] sins I believe in Jesus Christ then you
[1:01:45] see them right back in the world
[1:01:51] they made the confessions they done what
[1:01:53] they're supposed to do but they didn't
[1:01:55] continue on within when he didn't
[1:01:57] continue on God didn't have to confess
[1:01:58] they're saved
[1:01:59] we had to confess there was you know the
[1:02:03] Bible says you ever thought about this
[1:02:05] career he makes one intercession upon
[1:02:08] what now on your confession if you say
[1:02:15] you're saved God can save you but if you
[1:02:17] don't say you're safe God can't save you
[1:02:19] he can't override your free moral agents
[1:02:22] didn't make you decide that's why the
[1:02:25] scripture says that a man believers in
[1:02:27] his heart
[1:02:27] romans and confesses with his mouth the
[1:02:34] Lord Jesus Christ see then that way it
[1:02:37] can come to salvation because you've
[1:02:39] done what he said you believe it in your
[1:02:42] heart that's wonderful but when you make
[1:02:44] a confession and watch now what I'm
[1:02:46] saying
[1:02:46] toward you'll understand what it means
[1:02:49] that that he must accept you see if you
[1:02:55] don't say back to him the correctness of
[1:02:57] the word why we have to accept what
[1:02:59] you're saying did that click you
[1:03:06] understand if we don't say what he says
[1:03:09] why would he say what we say well Lord I
[1:03:16] believe you saved me because I didn't do
[1:03:18] this and I didn't do that I've been a
[1:03:20] good person well now he ain't got no
[1:03:23] welcome
[1:03:25] because all of it would be against him
[1:03:28] it's wonderful to be a good person but
[1:03:30] that's just a good neighbor but what
[1:03:34] about accepting him as your Savior but
[1:03:39] no one realizes if you don't accept him
[1:03:41] you're going to die and go to hell and
[1:03:43] miss the whole thing
[1:03:46] you might find out one of these days
[1:03:48] your word does mean a lot more once you
[1:03:50] think because if that scripture is right
[1:03:53] it says confess with the mouth not just
[1:03:57] believing in heart what I believe in you
[1:04:00] remember the story brother around told
[1:04:01] about the lady said I believe I received
[1:04:03] the Holy Ghost like not don't tell
[1:04:05] nobody
[1:04:06] now he said if you receive the Holy
[1:04:09] Ghost it's like a house on fire on a
[1:04:11] windy day and no way to put it out you
[1:04:14] ain't gonna be ashamed of it you're
[1:04:17] gonna tell everybody I like brother moat
[1:04:18] the way he said it
[1:04:20] he was you know probably rough feller I
[1:04:23] guess in his life and he got saved when
[1:04:27] he started around the neighborhood
[1:04:28] telling everybody about him getting
[1:04:30] saved well you know what they try to
[1:04:33] have him as he was they'd rather have
[1:04:36] him as he was as a sinner than to have
[1:04:38] him as it was then coming to Christ
[1:04:40] because you know why because he was
[1:04:42] going to be tempered it was he was going
[1:04:44] to condemn them he was condemning him
[1:04:46] right there because they didn't have
[1:04:47] what he had we get that time to be
[1:04:50] Christians he says something that's
[1:04:52] really hard he said I just didn't want
[1:04:57] him to talk about the Lord maybe they
[1:05:02] didn't know the Lord what about it
[1:05:07] God's talks are eternal it can never
[1:05:13] have a new thought their eternal and
[1:05:15] part of him his thoughts was before it
[1:05:21] became word he thought it and spoken it
[1:05:23] became a word maybe you need to say
[1:05:27] maybe you need to confess your salvation
[1:05:31] maybe you need to do what have you said
[1:05:34] believe in your heart
[1:05:37] that God have saved you and then confess
[1:05:41] it well I don't want to say it because
[1:05:43] the neighbors ain't gonna like it
[1:05:44] cuz I start living there doing different
[1:05:47] doing some well then don't worry about
[1:05:51] it you're not saying I'm sorry that's
[1:05:55] human
[1:05:56] yeah but you don't understand I'm saved
[1:05:58] I'm going to happen I just don't want to
[1:06:01] live too good while I'm here that's
[1:06:04] doing pretty good isn't it
[1:06:06] I've gotten why I supposed to do I've
[1:06:09] had people look right at me I'd done
[1:06:12] what God told me to do and he's got to
[1:06:14] save me now you're demanding it you're
[1:06:18] not accepting it and letting him work it
[1:06:20] out you're demanding that he do it
[1:06:23] because of what you've done that ain't
[1:06:26] gonna save you it's when you accept what
[1:06:30] he said and go confessing it the talking
[1:06:33] to sister there's one about healing the
[1:06:38] biggest portion of my healing has not
[1:06:39] been an instantaneous healing I've had
[1:06:42] that I've been delivered instantly from
[1:06:44] all kind of things you've been with me
[1:06:47] you've been there my eyesight my blood
[1:06:50] type change totally from a positive to a
[1:06:54] negative medically proven it means not
[1:06:57] something to argue I had a lot of little
[1:06:59] signs but you know what I get most of
[1:07:01] the time I'm hurting and I start saying
[1:07:06] by stripes I'm healed and every time it
[1:07:11] hurts I said by stripes I'm healed you
[1:07:17] see I don't say I'll say it when he were
[1:07:21] delivers me that's what most people say
[1:07:23] about faith they think that when you
[1:07:24] prayed for that he delivered you then
[1:07:27] you say you're healed that ain't Bible
[1:07:29] there ain't no scripture for that the
[1:07:32] scripture is you must confess before God
[1:07:35] can make it come to vice sometimes you
[1:07:41] got to just say thank you going
[1:07:44] every time that hurts that much more you
[1:07:46] say thank you Lord it hurts more and you
[1:07:49] said thank you Lord we're human beings
[1:07:53] we believe in going to doctors and
[1:07:54] taking medicines and doing things like
[1:07:56] that we're not contrary to the medical
[1:07:58] realm but I'll sit down with medical
[1:08:02] doctors many of them anytime I change
[1:08:04] doctors or whatever I do I sit down with
[1:08:06] them and explain to them one of the the
[1:08:09] doctor I'm here is that you help me I
[1:08:10] want you to give me what you can to help
[1:08:13] me and you try your best to help this
[1:08:14] old body but you ain't going to heal me
[1:08:16] or nothing because God's the only healer
[1:08:18] there is if you don't believe it that
[1:08:21] way then this let me go I'll go find me
[1:08:23] another one you know what you find some
[1:08:27] good doctors like that and you know what
[1:08:31] you'll find out they won't forget it
[1:08:35] when you go back to them they'll be yeah
[1:08:39] I know yeah we're Christians we're
[1:08:43] Christians what because they know that
[1:08:50] you're telling it lie which used to
[1:08:52] bless God I'm not going to take no
[1:08:58] medicine well why are you going to
[1:08:59] doctor pond you're going to take what it
[1:09:01] says where you going to well I need to
[1:09:04] go find out what's wrong with I know
[1:09:06] what's wrong with I mean you're hurting
[1:09:12] all over and you want to find out what's
[1:09:14] wrong we've well can go take no medicine
[1:09:17] well you won't find out what's wrong
[1:09:18] with right there's be sensible but say
[1:09:27] what God says God says your heal yes but
[1:09:32] if the Lord would ever just tell me that
[1:09:33] the Bible says by His stripes I am
[1:09:38] healed let me go say that until he knows
[1:09:44] it's a reality come on musician until he
[1:09:46] knows it's a reality in my heart and
[1:09:48] then he'll make it manifest and fall
[1:09:51] right in line it's never failed me yet
[1:09:53] so what I need to worry about anything
[1:09:59] but see we like I said we wanted to be
[1:10:01] delivered then we'll confess it I told
[1:10:04] you before about it we had services here

[1:10:35] home and rest I never would give him
