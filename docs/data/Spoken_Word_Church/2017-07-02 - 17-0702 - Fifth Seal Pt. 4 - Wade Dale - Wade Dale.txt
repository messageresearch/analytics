TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and up what prices up well the wind is not here either there is no there there visiting his father well it was Kim oh they got after Canada I got there yesterday by Revelation chapter 6 verse 9 we're on the big deal and I hope you finish early I just said I didn't bring my bottle immediately okay that's all right that's why we got it right so when you get over the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the words on testimony 1910-11 stepfather okay it does all this work okay so rho v feel now last time we when we ended we let will come up last night and bob study there's a purpose for everything that we do this person several things I hear that the purpose for him to write it in the word my contention is the same way with the property guy brother ground preached it then it's open for us to understand and be able to preach there's not a mystery I thought he would come revelation ten seven says in the days of or settle name it when the mystery is to be revealed so the mystery should be revealed on the voice of the seventh angel he spoke it and then guess what happened we take that and deliver it to the people all right and then in turns you have to your filter of the Holy Ghost to make sure that we're telling you the right thing make sure that it's exactly what the Prophet said and like I said before like last Sunday there is doing the brand quotes the will do this is probably one of the churches do Brent's the most quotes to the table but we have to and I'm not saying waste your time but do we have to make sure that brother Brown said no that's my job didn't study to make sure he said my brother L said he said try to tear down what I'm just preach so if he tries to break me down and if he can't break it down do my own brand bring you to the people if he is for the profit can't bring it down after bottle can't bring it down then it must be part of what the Bible is and what the Prophet said the brand preach to us you don't have to say brother I'm said right okay you can and it is your own revelation because if we just keep quoting what he said then you know 50 years more from now most of us in this room will be here right that's what somebody else saw somebody else here but if you can take it when I study I know before they were 30 we already know some of those quotes in our mind we don't have to go look them up okay it's like I've always did hardly anybody know what's in it hardly in it because of this I guess hardly anybody in this message had to be added to the list they just it cemented and we go to church and it's quotes and we believe program with the Prophet and hair and dress and clothes and yeah but me and brother Joe Kennedy was talking about he hurt somebody Norton in Indiana so my going he was a good Peter wolf he said hello he might be a good elementary school teacher our kindergarten school teacher buddy preached no doctrine and he did not use one quote when you talk about living a good life and doing this and doing that the dude with the dome and all right that's not even teaching to me yeah the bottom program strategic places you in the body even Paul in the book of Ephesians he knew he could talk to those Ephesians different than he could the crankin right why because he come to a place that he knew what God said out of the Old Testament and he took three his filter and give it to the agents up the day he laid a mistake in front of them without when he went to the correct in here some mashed potatoes and green beans and probably that mash them up a little bit you know he gives everything yeah in other words what he didn't want to work down but he just didn't choke them with it either he gave to them as they needed it but now you've got to remember one thing I think about this other day the properties I've told us that the congregation is what dictates what you preach so somebody's got to be maybe there's nobody in that church that wants a choir read that let's just you know don't name it let's just say they or know what to steal it's been such a measuring the biosuit well maybe that's why I warned up it stimulates my not stimulate my thigh man it stimulating my vision one place this man you know or know these things here and I say what we either breath same way with all of us we have come to a place that we have a spiritual appetite that surely can I live in Green Bay I love magical have some an idea for a brain look even green beans for Mullingar which inaudible have them and we'll help remember to make do it again right some will have that go in it I ain't don't have this painting and potatoes what is that that is Tommy if I say been converted that to me to sometimes might be but how will need to go with it you know thanks man shut your stop it forever son right you want something you know you want the reason say hit is when gone broke this field to the profit watch what happened he he quoted many kind of sold under the altar and you'll read the fifth seal and then all the other sealed he tells us he said now I know what this seal was he said my thought was totally different than that see he come to the thinking when he heard read that took his old nose and he pries sold under the altar which was the ones in the sixth dimension that he saw in 1960 well this is not conceited very and they going to reveal to him that look he's reading they cried how long how long dispels judge and avenge our blood and out that struck brother branham he didn't have to have a quote his Holy Ghost said that can't be a born-again believer listen I don't believe that angel sit there and verbatim told him everything that we unseal he gave you a little point he gave him a little point he gave a little point and run around by because it was his revelation remember that angel that was liberal around never did give him a revelation now we know that Christ came to do this we know that but still brother on how to get it right through his filter they said hey that's not us I know nothing to do with a bribe because avenge our blood will call out vengeance when we call mercy Jesus did call out vengeance and call mercy right so further I said okay now the other lights to this a little bit more then we see that that's the fifth seal Jew all Jewish nothing to do with jihad or any other nation because honestly he came to the Jews they were jacking him they turned him down but he said I'll not forget it so that in other words he's got to go back and get him and I'm gonna say that and this is where most said he caused them to not know any further God caused them not to go any further yeah played you like you then he had you know mother because that's just expression yeah that they just got to me that's why did did not bring a higher form of justification not just that he chopped off their past and he never saw these people sin if he ever saw that fish-filled youth end he could give me I can do it so I said this is justification time - this is the higher level of justification did they never did that in here not okay come you have to judge them if you did but he's not need to look and white robes were given unto every every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow-servants I'll do it that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so you fit seal is coming out of the listen to me is coming because remember they're given white rope so we're not given what route we're given what Road here when we receive the baptism of those that is our white rope so we receive it here they've received it after they had now that's not true to a Gentile except for the 50 of you I'm sorry the Buddhist version and the ones given eternal life's cup water my name they'll be given my rope echovox on judgement these don't go to watch on judgment they're given a white robe right here during this time so see that's a whole nother situation but it says but it's the justness of God to be just he's gotta be a judge and he actually judged himself I called that don't you think obvious hurts what a man they did I all that and I have a problems left more foundational world world he called it you know but to but to have continuity to his plan like I said last night I'll keep saying over and over again there's no other way we can understand except by this Bob no way I mean sure man's going to run their hair the ologist have a good idea over here isn't gonna but right there everything happens in that we're going to show me who does it and we and you know what he didn't write it he did write it to hide it from the Bible proof but not uh that would be able to learn it because oh well he said lobby agent everybody walk you know period well one just up he can't just you then we can't judge you now he can judge you by everything he wrote now he can judge you but all he's got to do is go let go okay this this this is this is the part you missed I don't have to in other words like saying when we get to the washroom gentlemen we're not going to be lawyers they have to go back in and go back in the bathroom and go this way right what I will have to let those oh no will know instantly and that person I believe will know - nothing three terms on them right you say well how long will it take you know here we go again Louis take out that technicality how long's it going to take that you in here will buy the able to live right there if they just let that walk through and do anything to be over will hired us where you darling you I know what the matter but then people blast on many times if you talk about your lives and talk about what a meaning I can run through the laser things in my life in a minute you're probably like it real back and so now when they come up out of that ground they stand before Judge know if you think everything's gonna be opened differently actly so what I'm saying we're not to have to eternal have to preach to live another word they got briefed to over here here you don't have to preach to a level that yes that does one like resurrected once you die whatever way the three lanes that's a way of offering if you die on you're not a Christian then you know rebuilt if you die you're with Christians and you know what's going to happen that's what I like about the Word of God tells us all these things but if I see that this is not just a justification just just didn't chop off their past census this eradicated ever sin that they have a committed it had to to thinking what wrote that the hurry they got to be clean in here lives and his judgment says I did this to get run I did this to get u-turn looking at us to get us he blinded their eyes so therefore I don't have a problem with them get some I shouldn't know much everything problems done but yes there's no problem with white robes were given unto them we in there while I work Jews they were teach kids mongers you know they were thieves that's not something good yes why Rome's given they're one of them this then that did that fifth field you don't be giving her life and I have no say-so to that okay but I can glean out of that that not only were they justified they didn't do God I bit into never brother Bible will bring it out next Sunday we're brother and sister is a higher form of justification as the harmfulness a magician if that that you did it we've covered this before you did it you did it you know you did I wish not going to raise my mind things I do but when I became justifying though glory off that off and mice labels as clean as this right here right of my past then right but now three weeks later I was still doing the same thing that I was doing see this is all white now this is still goes back to smutty black because my soul your black hello you're justified it only jumped off you pass in here if you know if you if you live years without repenting or without anything changing you're going to help look Judas was trained to fight anyone else and he comes through justification right so that justification chopped off the past in but now the next thing other have said is this as if you never done it and then the third one if the real you didn't I just want I'm trying to get us to see that Genesis 1.6 money God burns out all nature is you out that Inge is one point six moves in and you become a new creature a new creation you're tied to the turtles you're just as eternal as audience there's no man confusion no land killing why you had all that burn out not just burn out and tomorrow I got I'm telling you folks if we're still two plays that we're fine of alcohol and drugs and cousin and running around and and all that stuff we're fighting it then you just have the case justification that's all you're gone then you know you think about it and I'm you're many people in the evenin its message well why have to hold those because I don't smoke no more I don't smoke them off the fire at the hodo that's not true could be true sorry could be true but don't beat on that could be true but brother Ram says justification he said the sins gone from your past the desire is still there you're still going to do it Michael Anthony she can't get hold of bill woman over your pants well if you are passing you know electors okay you still coming you got hotel but why don't we dealing with these things now because people are not taught they just think they come in here and sit down and give it just feeling anywhere I'm not coming here anywhere now a good feeling got to the profit I've done a mystery that you don't know I don't something you don't have or I have something you don't know and they said there and that's why you see now what this is manifest in town so even the preachers with your number one the preachers never got the Holy Ghost good if you've got to hold goes you'll never leave this man so here we go again that free trader Holy Ghost he lead to message and denies it sure now he might be interested illusion let me back up but if he continues all in that direction you know one thing for sure God didn't burn that old nature of them yet that own danger talk about death and said I got something now they didn't probably got that's Adele I got something Barry thought all right and I got some very Gaga at the deli that dented 1.6 money I eat we're not saying if we see that that Genesis 1.6 man there never was up but our soul has done it why not the Holy Ghost and buyer will read some today I think maybe we'll get it that fire burns got out and I just burned out what happened when it heard it out then we spirit goes out of a man Walton drop ways and see red last night what comes back let it work but what if you took that void and brought the jinns is 1.6 man quit me in a minute you're done you're done yes that's eternal life which bobbling you burp you received you guys say it that way the Genesis 1:26 never had a new birth okay the Genesis 1:26 is not a new birth the judge is 126 coming in perfect insulting you is the new birth Johnson is one which is not a bucket nut that you don't have the perfect justice is 1.6 men all the time okay know what it does you know till the jumps is 1.6 man is about pizza mother holds up besides all the other thing to this but if the new birth it be if the effects of the new birth because the new birth is what you weren't birth right the first time so the judge is 1.6 men makes you reborn are as halted regenerated the genetics of Genesis 1:26 man is not in me and my soul never again will a bit of my natural earthly time you'll still have a part of your nature right okay when I get to heaven you're not over when I get must a heaven when I get to the future home y'all don't have to find me hidden under a rock we talking like citizens barber are are are not talking like this apart but you know what though that's refrain characteristic and are likely so it's okay exactly right right but you might have to find her she may be whispering over there I don't think so but all things are better but we still keep that you know how codes are like that I will get over this later on and it does cuddling this fit seal because there's fish still to me is great the probably got any traditional and bread this he's a master builder he's a master designer how do you get here think about how you doc it I think he wants Carol I am sure he does did you gotta grow up he loved bro he uh scotland's be little Ellen sue because there are there were only we're only different but what I'm saying is that jess is 126 ma'am changing your nature of the things of the world program busy when I don't want to get any change so much before that morning in East I still like the know that I didn't change that the major part if you keep okay because like we're talking about this afternoon me if we get to it is back to that to live to likes and life TX we didn't get to the lesson look for two lights falters a lot that I know it I live but the favorites undone but over he didn't train home now I'm just a walking zombie no now God has burned out why I used to be put into Genesis wonderful Anders Genesis 1:26 ma'am it holds unique makeup comes from Word of God a whole DNA makeup if you you have a sheet if you have your blood tested now they put you in a Saturday your your DNA that is in a database somewhere everybody and that will show the imprint that you were the daughter of your earthly mother father and your grandfather and you grab on and you very careful that take a trigger bummer Santa in Genesis once we see now as why that that you know programs of heat it like that song it's a nice salt his royal blood now flows in my veins no it does now I still got the DNA what mom on mom and a game but when I'm changed when it's outside person change it will be changed to what a body like his glorious body which came right straight from the word ago so the DNA of God is the word of God if you want to see we want to go back to the pattern of one of your black why you got a different I different mouth wait don't you know the do's and don'ts with your body that's in your genetic power of your staff in your strand all the same thing here I can tell a Christian night and run around you know he said give me two minutes and somebody knows I tell you where these are holes open on I don't believe it discernment tree I deserve it but they're sort of things that you can say that people or even hear that people say and you know they do something well something going on something I why because the characteristics of this genetic made us has not come in and vulcanized I like that word vulcanize because most people don't know how to explain well enough well can i did you trade rubber and rubber you don't take rubber metal you don't a brother in plastic now pipe lack get the part of rubber but plastic melts to the floor temperatures in rubber does but if you say rubber rubber so you had to have that predestination come from God right and then when God comes in he takes and burns that's why the Holy Ghost and fire he burns out that old nature and when you take them and when you remelt something even plastic you remelt it you said two things like this plastic here and this plastic here and you put them in a pot and melt them you'll never separate next planet you can't find the separation because it's the molecules of this plastic or rubber has vulcanized with this plastic or rubber and it's so intertwined but when you can see the past now in a natural aspect we can't see the past because I know Joel knows know some of y'all that we used to ride bicycles man you get a whole new bicycle you ain't got your rubber potty you can do plastic water a metal one you got a rubber packet you took them help you can you just--can you get something from an off of the smoke you can get a splitter hit like this bit the one it flips over you know and you said then you heat that thing almost it melt it be almost boys then you put a little bit good on it we pass on it well it becomes one but you can see that but not in God and God you can't see this the scenes when you come together when that Genesis one man comes in now that's what do you want either chocolate he just took us around the world to get that you see it took us it just comes up coming in human flesh to have that come into it but these are and see that's difficult this is not a new birth this is an impartation of eternal life this is not a new birth trip the 50 of you does not receive the baptism of the holy goat like we do because you've got to be alive right to receive the holy up to be reborn you got to be alive these people are dead most of them I mean it's more coming but these people are already dead and then when the white rope has to be given to him God has been part eternal life which you can do anytime you want to but this group of people has a meaning to me though more than that is Grace in this second stage of justification even if they didn't do it and you're not going to look at these people when we get the glory no it's a pit filled view that made it to them you'll made it under under the door you know they just barely know you know why you will hug your neck so they're the hands of into them the implanted right we want to make in you and that's why I was getting Mac right now look at it now that way thought that is a special group and that special group II told you so it gives me faith for that justification because you know what there's no worse than I was another Center I turned the Word of God down I did to think that what that I listed what are them to men that yeah I was a Gentile how was it I love that blinded by the maker I was over here in another group given a choice exactly great grace on both sides Amazing Grace on both sides amazing grace to see this is a part of the plan of God and just even I was a part of planning ugh but if it hadn't been for that part of the plan I would be okay amen so let's don't think let's don't belittle this fish till geologists they know what they're doing then does bears amaze know they were any plans off they went a plan purpose of God vision part of the condescending of God because I see mounds that more very slimming than ever before that God gets grapes he integrate you didn't just give great history so until your fifth seal now grace justification comes to you which is a higher all right because look let me tell that then we'll go the first justification you can be justified and still down go ahead the second part of this justification you cannot die know that so we got that higher form you've already been born again those double bring you back out and make me start over again no this part of justification is what what I said the first revelation for the body change I start to get into my memory reason conscious affection imagination I have got to get that Genesis 1:26 man to take over that next realm then you ought to know I did I was there when I did but the real we didn't do the real one that says that that the real one that motivates me now was that that's why I don't that's why I don't see how people can believe that they came there with eternal life how can you come here with eternal life in your soul and do the things you did yeah I don't care if you lost a bit of lobster or a nunnery yeah never touch your carmine is what killed him these carnal honey one killed her it wasn't her body function that was the part you let in here so we're all born in sin Satan iniquity but yeah I did that representation yes but he wasn't here while the brother I say the Holy Ghost the fire comes in at the new birth burns out the old nature well he was already in there why did he just do the work while he's in there no I'm born in sin I just like to believe the old fashion I would love and if I had known God I went ahead but by the foreknowledge of God knowing that I would want it at a point he would meet me and I would say okay I said that and then now means that it was that far in justification now him accepting me okay here's the next part so he's gotta accept me here after I'm born again here they said why because we're going for a change we're not going just for our soul become it's already turned we're going to where you got to get that outside man not this man not this not the place maybe the black is just nothing but a robot it just is just where everything is by some I did the other day your bones are just to hold you muscles together you mustn't let it hold you both together and all their oh your and keeping fall down basically but the firing mechanism inside is mixed together with what we ought to worry about that's why I can have a heart transplant from somebody that's a dead loss center and that don't hurt my soul at all that don't change me but now remember like though they'll always did they've never done a brain transplant why because that's where that fire mechanism in that for that memory reasoning concentration imaginate all that company right easy remember you all over this exact thing are here up here right your mind is your mind well a thank you brain memory reads an angry reads you reasonable you body no conscious all your conscious and subconscious this control volume and affection come from here remember always be you know the greatest be own the greatest organism art your large ordination can put your grass or it in your brain because if your brain stops you're done okay intervention your fashion doesn't come from though this part of your heart you know you it comes from here why because it all connects for your burning your brand what tell you what to do when to do it how you guys and that you did it that way before right so that's why we can't do brain transplant the soul is not in your brain but your branch is that firing mechanism I was looking yesterday you know we're dealing with with Jim's mother heaven and you take a brand of a normal person which is you know solve it you see all these call them ridges and everything in it then you got the court day you lose your dress daily and it's not black it's actually milky living but at all times patient that's the way their brain looks and this part right here is totally black it's rotting from the inside out those nerve endings if I go they'll fit you know when you learn how to ride bicycle your nerve anything's go together and that's your memories that route that reminds you with how ride Liza all right go to store or how to Greece's radicals you what my brain goes is here right my brain don't do right but now in Alzheimer's patient they start actually rotting from the inside out and that's what was what the brain looks like a big like a watermelon with the inside hold out and it with this black there in other words there's no life there's no firing mechanism as there well to me that's always saying is that's the same way we have so much sin in our in our not in just our natural brain goes remember that don't go through that you can go through that gray matter but you send when you soak you're sending from the deep dark inside of you you can't what I'm saying is you taste that well my brain if there's my brain I born with this brain no you bring order but there's a firing mechanism I'm the organ and it's called a theophany our soul and your soul is the real Youth Center our thing that's why that we can be good and an animal can't be do an animal can't be good for what they do right but we're just and that happy day what there are going to be just as God did something to that group of people and said I'm going to blind them I mean my one that we talked about last night what about Jesus came in every way of Bible settings no come remember that for me just for a moment there was no he sent no Manuel is not asked before they had the Torah and maybe some of the little books go remember the little boats come later they definitely had the Torah that Moses stroke you know make it work mode we're moved to we know that I am only talking money but you take that and you look and you see that that Jesus came exactly the way about what all it was you come the old emergency bring for the child adult any language you know where Jesus to me I be so frustrated I walk into a temple none go what part of this did I miss you know I break won't book got him all under life I came as a virgin no you didn't you were born forked I came as this I came to this and they kept going no no kitty he's not he's pretending to be God but he came just the way God said he won't come that's the blindness then and let it blood be on us and our children right here our children which is coming up to now but God said okay but I'll not forget you I won't forgive you I'm not gonna forget you but I'm not gonna let you where I had you in my position is why you'll not be my life anymore you're going to be serviced but you're going to get eternal life cause I blinded your us so that you couldn't see the great Messiah I'm standing before you so what a great comedian fifty was just well as head for the apex is head towards the look there is nothing in this that's filial up you know well naughty people feel your love is like this all of my husband all the time you are not feeling well now job a lot of takes over and you love your husband if you're born again and they're born again then that's one of the other boxes to can't walk if they don't agree because you're going to be it's like II do a lot of well all you want to fill you up it's only just say I mean it's not even you can't see it aim on the picture comes up a little but there's not much great in filial love come on people you can imagine uh big man who I woke up for three whole days it was your fault I goes out there and then your fault anemia if you come there fall then you blame your kids your kids did it right that's not filial I mean I thought agape love that's agape love yes right they hated me get on the low enough giving her one they hated me they they denied me and turn me balance it you're not even say you are so let's take this grace and embrace it because once we get to right here this divine love does not go from memories and conservation imagination it works through it it works really you always don't have to work through your brain Blackey telling you you got it right so you built on the whole ego you got to run it through your memory reason on suspense amazing all right let's active I love is the doctor love it we don't understand because what's going to happen is is from filial love this body can well so there is no live it up right that one is dead Robin on his way to hell so they come from except to keep love but now when I guess is 1.6 man which to me is I got below when it moves in and takes over then it turns out all the other I love my wife more now because under standard for what born-again Christians we don't always know mountain so might only one down these it takes to madly to make one metal thanks to Valley tomato out so you go out a lot of this but in the valley and you alright so keep that off there so then let's make it so much they always yeah Wow well get the level and I'm getting for it but hoping my letters ok let's go yes I know and after some a Leo that's just a human [Music] pleasure my last corneas let me make this point the reason I can take a body change is that I can realize that God overcomes everything that they did to give them eternal life so does going to overcome everything I do to give me one chance so don't think you would do our jumping left hand does not know hand they thought this right they got this figure mystically know an animal just does not move away can you comment pregnant for the hounds are out control that's why no we need to get that yet better time worker truck is no she is taking animal extra in my eyes and it's just about the wife of our gala bottle to bring order to the name of Jesus Christ to make this organ orders extend hearing me talk about you lord played just does not that he cannot stand you learn to be spoken so that was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the word well we believe are standing here we review their thing and even one of time that believer and everything will be fine we are on board thank you a decent game basically [Music] [Music] why do you know how to handle it oh you got this buildin number 14 I mean third thing you need to involve [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] forty-eight oh great laura mercier how we go forward
