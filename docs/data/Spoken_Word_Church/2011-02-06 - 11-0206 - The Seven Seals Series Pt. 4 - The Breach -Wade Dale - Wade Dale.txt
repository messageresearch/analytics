========================================

let's read that part luke 17. luke chapter 17. and here we go we're going to start at verse 20. what i want to do is get you to get you in into the part where the son of man is is something that you really i want you to think about because if you're born again today um i didn't hit paul no you're not gonna really need to steal a book today but i want you to get in the habit of bringing it okay it's kind of like when we were in football you know if you fumbled the week before guess what you did you carried the football the whole next week during class and everything never happened to me because i didn't care the football but apple did a lot of the quarterback and running back and if you remember you were in home ec they gave you a five pound bag of flour or whatever sugar that's what an egg that's what i want you to do in the steel book because it's going to be much more important than any egg or a bag of flour i hope so just get in habit of bringing it get in the habit of bringing the seal book and when we start reading in it you'll have it you won't fumble but we're going to start in the breach but i want to read this first because this is for background before we look at what we saw from the son of god to the son of man what we were doing down here and the son of god if you're born again today the son of god should not be a mystery to you that should be that new birth that's inside of you the one that's leading you and guiding you and bringing you revelation of the word correct right that's the son of god not to say that the son of god is not important but if you're born again you have the son of god all right you have the son of god revelation because it had to be revealed to you that you had that all right but the son of man is what the mystery is all right so now let's read luke 17 20 and even scofield didn't pick this up but you know usually he says he shows you a reference point this does not reference matthew 24 but it exactly is matthew 24 like what we were reading in a bible study last night all right because in matthew 24 and 25 it says that uh if you say low christ is here and don't go because he's not there you understand what i'm saying so in luke watch what he says and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you that's the baptism of the holy ghost that's the son of god the new birth the creator god the one that was before the foundation of the world and that's what you have inside of you is in your birth it's a revelation of who that person is all right now jesus does not finish he continues and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one see that one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it now they didn't see it naturally because he knew they weren't going to live long enough to see it but spiritually let me just put it to you this way the son of man never went out of existence right because brother raham said it was son of god through the seven church ages well that doesn't say that the son of man was dead and gone somewhere else it was the revelation of that son of man was always there in the bible it always was in the teachings even of paul because what do we get the son of man revelation from what's in the bible but they didn't have the revelation to give to the people like this end time prophet did when he saw the revelation of the son of man when the son of man actually was made flesh right there in that man through that man now brother branham was not god he was a son of man revealing the son of man he was that trumpet he was the one that was giving the voice that or god was using his voice to get to me and you all right you will see what you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it why that flesh jesus christ ascended and he has not come back yet nobody understand that the son of god came back on the day of pentecost in the hearts of the people and it made god in human flesh right here just like we are now but there's a time that the son of man is going to come back in power in manifestation not that the son of man went somewhere on vacation and came back in the end time no it had to be we were talking about last night with somebody you know um teaching somebody how to to show that a prophet had to come in the end time there was a lot of mysteries that was not revealed you got baptist mystery methodist pentecost and all these things now and they were not made known as like i said we're not going to be we're not going to heaven with confusion someone had to come you had there had to be a prophet a word prophet come in the end time because luther came and and he did a little bit of work of restoring back because he brought faith back to the people back in the in the middle age or fourth age it was dark ages they put their faith in the catholic church do penance do this do that works exactly works so now here's martin luther bringing a group of people out that says we've got to live by faith well now that's what paul preached i live by the faith of the son of god so so so uh martin luther was bringing the people to a realization that they didn't need to do work they needed to have faith in god but now yet martin luther still had things about him that he had followed some holy ghost baptism i'm sure he was trinitarian he still had roman catholic ideas but god was using what that man to bring a group of people out to see part of the word well now that's restoring but it's reformation they call it reformation because it was reforming the people it is an act of restoration because it's bringing everything back up the trees growing back again all right two shoes but in martin luther's teachings he didn't tell the people not to smoke not to drink not to you know do the things that the catholic church does why he was reforming alcoholics known same thing that's reformation you're reforming somebody when you restore somebody back with which in in this day and time you can never do that unless you have the holy ghost right you can go to alcoholics anonymous and they'll tell you you are an alcoholic until the day you die that's what they tell you right right you're an alcoholic accept it realize you are and stay away from it well some do some don't that's reformation that's why martin luther could smoke a pipe and drink beer because he was reforming the people out of an age he was coming to do a part of restoration because it was restoring the people back but it didn't go to full restoration because it didn't restore the people back to gifts things of the flesh not to do sanctification stuff like that but god liked that that was what god wanted that was all the people could stand so he took martin luther birthed him into the body put a group of people in the ground and then raised up a man named john wesley now john wesley was also a reformer because he even said drinking tea was not profitable to your body so it was a sin so he told about what drinking tea well see that's reformation you can't get that out of restoration that's reformation that's reforming that's alcoholics anonymous but yet they had the new birth for their time all right but see if if you take and restore somebody see that means you take this is original and during the ages or during a certain length of time it got put to this well it's still the same twist height all right but something's happened to it so i'm going to reform it that's reform because it never went anywhere but now what is what is this that's restored back to its original condition so i want you to get reformation and restoration the difference in reformation to reform somebody is they might do it again right martin luther could smoke a pipe and drink a beer and and do the things like that and and still be a son of god but be a son of god in his time right that's right like that but he was still like that okay excuse me i think what you're saying is you restore something through reformation when you reform something it's going in stages right to restoration which is the final project you had to have reformation reformation is not bad you know brother branham saying well they were just reformers the reason they were reformers they weren't word prophets if they were word prophets as soon as that word struck their heart it would have be and then with the holy ghost it would have said baptism in the name of jesus christ no eternal hell no trinity but it didn't martin luther was coming through reformation he was reforming the people but it was an act of restoration because what do you do when you put in matthew or john where it says the seed must go on the ground if it doesn't die to buy it alone well now did he come back up and look like a corn no started out with two little things that didn't even look like the seed two little green shoots sticking up but somewhere in those two little green shoots was the life of that seed that you planted when jesus planted that seed on the day of pentecost that was the life but see he said it has to go back to that original grain not the whole plant right so now you got martin luther john wesley all right the stalk coming up what are you doing you're still reforming people right now we drink tea if martin luther i mean if john wesley would have seen us drinking tea to keep us out of the church that's reformation right that's reforming somebody right but when brother branham came the holy ghost came on the day of pentecost to restore the gifts that give a platform for the prophet to step out on what if brother branham would have came in right at the end of wesley's age when we were still riding horses and and brother branham comes on the scene and he starts blasting no eternal hell and and all the things that he was he was preaching people couldn't stand it but you had reforming joshua led by faith let's all live a sanctified life oh now we've got a holy ghost here and we're speaking in tongues we're doing just like the book of acts said to a degree they still had fathers and holy ghost baptism that's why they were still reforming but see when the grain comes back again that's what had to come back was the grain had to come back then that was what went in the ground which was restoration restoring it back to its original condition and that's what brother branham did from 47 to 63. he brought a restoration back to the original word got all the loose ends tied together and then like we were talking about a few weeks ago then he brought the son of man message not to say the son of man wasn't in there because he talked to the son of man even back in the 50s he said in the beginning was the word words with god and he said that was son of man that was the son of man would not cut our hair and wear dresses and that kind of thing would that be reforming that would be that would be reforming if you did it because you had to right alcoholics anonymous says if you don't drink you'll be okay but now restoration is i was a drunk one time which i wasn't but i cheated all my life from 14 years old to until i was 39. every day my life but when the lord brought me to a state of sanctification it was from one day to the next day and i've never wanted it again sure boy it smells good sometimes that's the old flesh man right right that's right see we're still we're still trying to restore this guy the restoration is what was inside but see it keeps this outside guy under control right all right and that's what's happened down through the ages is that thing inside of you called the holy ghost i can call it a thing because the bible called it a thing he told mary he said that thing in you and be conceived of the holy ghost all right that's what's keeping you clean but it did not take away the sin curse right because you're still dying right we're still getting older things we got problems and things are going on we're still putting people in the grave that was under the sun god dispensation people are going to still die just like we said before right but somebody had to come back and preach a message and show that god was coming back in human flesh again not by himself but in a group of people he's had a bride but from 47 to 63 that's what brother branham was trying to get us back to where paul said the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god that's what he was trying to get everybody back to and then he had a message to bring past that right all right so let's listen to that do i thank god they didn't reform that that's right because we wouldn't have been restored thank god they didn't restore back then yes if they didn't if they had restored back in the when the holy ghost fell see because the holy ghost fell on a group of trinitarians so that wasn't full restoration right even f f bosworth one of the greatest brother brown called him the greatest faith healer of his time he never saw the message of the hour he was under that age of coming out of that holy ghost 1906 through the street and he was a faith healer to a degree that was you know rivaling brother branham i would say but he was not a word prophet he was he was he took the word of god and he lived it the best he could the son of god lived through him and did the healing everybody understand that but he never accepted the message he never said he was still a trinitarian he's still baptized as far as i know in the name of father son holy ghost see so that was back in that time when that was happening and brother branham was trying to get him out of that or hit god through brother branham not brother branham but god through him was trying to get him to a place to restore back just to the faith of the fathers down at that bottom that's why i said we read malachi 4. but there's something else because remember we read then matthew 17 where the son of man has to be risen again son of man rose 2 000 years ago on easter sunday we didn't nobody killed him except we killed the effects of him doing anything in during the church ages as the son of man all right but now at the end time with the word fully restored back and then christ coming down in revelation 10 7 just like he promised he would and he would take all the mysteries and time all together and listen this is god in simplicity this is the simplest form that god will ever be in is right now because he said you won't see me no more the world he said but you'll see because i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's the son of god but the son of man has to come back in power in the end time everybody's saying so man son of man and son of man well let's see verse 22 and he said a disciple the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and he shall not and ye shall not see it all the way through the church ages you know he said and you shall and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them or follow them for as the lightning that lighteth out of the one part under heaven remember we read that last night the bible says the light and come from the east to the west so shall the son of man well what did son of man start he started in what jerusalem the east where'd he end up in the west brother brown said he went all the way around cities at the west coast now which was california he's going to china now in our time and brother brown said he had to end back up in what the east again right because they're going to see this they're going to see the son of man one day the whole world is they're going to see jesus christ in human flesh but they're going to see him in judgment that's not going to be what they think it's going to be because they're going to miss the coming that we're talking about right now for as the light the lightning that lighteth out into one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation what was he saying that's when the first son of man is going to be buried going to be put down right there he was the son of man he was the son of man with the son of man ministry standing on earth right there but he told them that though when the son of man raises again so there's another part coming and as it was in the days of noah so shall also be in the days of the son of man what did they do they did eat drink they married wives plural wives marriage and divorce many wives they don't mean polygamy so much that means they married and given and married married married married divorced married and divorced they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed we know for a fact he was not revealed back then they did not know who that man was oh peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god all right they knew god was inside that man but they did not know who that son of man was in that day he which shall be upon the house top and his stuff on the house let him not come down to take it away and he that's in the field let him likewise not return back remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it talk about us and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one she'll be taking the other one she'll be left what's he talking about let's talk to resurrection or talk about the rapture i mean all right two women shall be grinding together one be taken one left two men should be in the field one taking one left and the answer to send it to him where lord where is this going to happen and he said unto them wheresoever the body is neither will the eagles be gathered together just like it's when the carcass is getting like we read last night this is the same this is the same scenario if you look in the bible matthew mark luke and john doesn't always put everything in order together the same one's got one view of a different thing luke this is exactly what we read last night in matthew 24 and 25 exact same thing but this was luke's interpretation of it more of the man intelligence of whatsoever the body is whatever the carcass is there shall the eagle be together now like daddy said and that's true you take scripture has different meaning that scripture means when everybody's killed and the carcasses are laying dead all over the ground the eagles or vultures are going to eat them up but in a spiritual sense since the son of man is coming back in this day wheresoever the word carcast the word whatsoever the body is this will the eagles be gathered together all right so that one this one wants you to see that the son of man was on the earth at one time he died ascended sent the holy ghost back on the day of pentecost as the son of god to give the people the holy ghost you don't see him again he said you'll see me no more but you'll see me again in the end time all right like in matthew will the son of man be risen again now let's go to revelation 5. well you know whoever hears this or sees this or all you people sitting here i want you to understand one thing 90 of the people in this message do not understand they cry son of man solomon they do not understand who some man is they do not understand why he had to come they do not they just say he's here i don't think so he's got to come in revelation first then he comes back to get a group of people truthfully truthfully we're not going to see him until we see him in the air that's right the son of man the physical that's right flesh one you can touch because he's going to be where in you and i because we have to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh sure we're married to him by the son of god ministry we're married to him by the holy ghost that's inside of us but he doesn't only just want that like sister trudy was was talking we were talking just a minute ago when god took that book we were talking about this book here in revelation just for a second when god took that book back from adam satan came down and he was brother brown said he was a squatter he had a right to your body because it fell he caused it he interjected himself into the human race through this through the beast he interjected his seed into the human race not his natural seed because look people satan don't have a seed satan cannot reproduce itself right he has no power right he has no life he had to go into god's laboratory break into the god's laboratory and see that well if this goes here god will have to give it life so he took that beast which he knew he was a master scientist himself closest to god right he wasn't a dummy closest man to god there is still is that's right he knew that seed would mingle with her seed so he got that beast to do what he could and he knew god had to give it life because remember brother brown everybody says well uh the bible says i got a man from the lord brother ramsay sure the lord's only one that can give life satan knew that satan took god's word kind of deep satan took god's word and made it work right see that's what they're doing now that's what anointing one's at the end time is doing they're taking god's word and making it work but yet they're the devil that's right because they've never been born again on the inside faults anointed one they're false but the anointing has to be true because if you get healed it's got to be from god you cannot believe right but he entered into god's laboratory saw that and knew if he could get energetic himself that he could take a claim on this right here and then by the nature of the fall he could get into you and cause you to do things that were wrong then he knew that god would have to judge you that's not a dummy but he thinks he can get enough on his side of this or whatever to defeat god because that's what maybe he wanted a better kingdom than michael and he still does he didn't he didn't stop because he got beat you know the first time but here in revelations 5 we see a book that book come from god almighty it was a book of names it was the bible all right everybody understand that book of life book of names all right and it was sealed up now you're going to hear maybe it sounds a little contradictory but this bible wasn't sealed up to the degree that man didn't know anything when man opened this book god opened their eyes to certain things right because the book wasn't sealed and nobody knew nothing until the end time that's what a lot of people think in the message that martin luther didn't have anything wesley didn't have anything because the book was stealing the book was sealed but man could open the physical book and by being born again the holy ghost inside of them could coincide with the part of the word that they could see for their time so they can open the book right you know we can physically open this book and still be clothed that's right right that's right we can physically read this book you many people in denominations they're reading this book now they're going to baptize people hundreds of them probably today in the name of father song holy ghost they're going to get it out of this open book right physically open book but spiritually it's close to their eyes they can't see the part that they're supposed to see all right so let's not see that when this book is closed and then it's open that is something that's physical and everybody's going to be able to see the only time every eye is going to behold is when when he comes in judgment that's the only time everybody's going to see him every knee is going to bow every tongue is going to confess that's way over there away from from from what we're talking about here all right so now why why was there no rapture in the other ages because the son of man ministry was not there the ability for man to have a body that can be restored not reformed because you can you can reform your body you can make your body that people make their body every day do things right right that's right i mean but that's reformation see to restore me back to my original condition when the book was in the hands of the one that was supposed to brought me out adam that's been lost right and then we've worked in permissive well now that's right god's permitted these bodies to come he had to because he said let every seed bring forth of his kind and there was no way he could take that back once he said it see once he said it satan heard that and said hmm that seed will mix with that one all right and i'll get in the human race right there well god knew that but still it's the perfect plan that's right well that's it still everything's gonna bring forth his kind spiritual or natural right all right so that part that god had for adam to bring us into the world with a flesh body put that genesis 126 man in there and us live eternally our bodies becoming eternal somehow somewhere adam's body wasn't even eternal it was just being renewed every day what the prophet said we must believe that you can't explain it just believe it because we're not going back to that condition that's right we're going back to the condition where that that body wasn't brought out of the womb of a woman because that genesis 1 26 was not brought out of the womb of a woman he said multiply and replenish before they were ever put in a human body spiritual multiplication that's right the spoken word is original seed that's what brother brown really started seeing i believe when what his message was all about in the spoken words regional city because when when you know the angel said as of yet malcolm 4 hasn't been made known in you then something was coming that was more or greater or better than what he had preached before all right but to fully restore somebody back you got to have the ability to get back to restoration restore i will restore i won't reform reform is going to happen but i will restore the years that all this thing happened and then we're going to be restored back to a garden of eden conditions so let's read just a few verses and then we'll just a few minutes and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals all right and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now what now is the importance of the seal john was standing there if you'll read your breach john the baptist john john the revelator was standing there with the holy ghost in his soul knew he was an eternal creature that's right he didn't have the holy ghost that was 1890 he got the holy ghost in 80 30 because he was in the upper room he had to hold those for 60 years he's probably 80 or something years old you know he was a little bitty boy when when jesus brought him into into the uh the disciple here he is in his old age and in verse four he's weeping wife's done weeping he's born again he's going to heaven he's got it made pretty much i mean just in human terms he's he got a free ticket if you're born again today you got a free ticket you may have to die that's true but you got a free ticket to heaven if you're born again why do we strive for the rest of this and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man now if you're reading your book brother brown said there was michael was there gabriel was there he said but it took a man not an angel took a man and no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on right and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look their own brother around said all the prophets were there so it's going to take something mightier than just a prophet but why was john weeping why was he weeping he was a born-again believer he was seeing things he'd never seen before he was writing things that he that man had never seen before why was john crying you ever thought of that now this is the breach the breach is between the church ages and the seals bringing out of the church ages because in the church ages is the son of god ministry right so we had to come out of the son of god ministry out of the church ages there had to be a breach to show what happened all right because i always look at it this way revelations 4 brother brown said the bribe goes out in revelations 4 and i'll see you in revelation 19. right but now in a spiritual aspect we get everything in between right in revelations 4 we went in a rapture and in heaven this is what we're going to see just what four describes that's the first thing i believe we're going to see when we get in heaven right now verse 5 he's going to tell us how we got there because in revelation 5 if revelation 5 don't come into view if if somebody doesn't stand on this earth and take a body change none of this is going to happen but since it's already been written somebody's going to come to it and it's going to happen that's right so we just got to believe that besides okay all right but in revelations 5 we see how it happened why was john weeping verse five and one of the elders senator me weep not behold the line of the tribe of jude in other words one of them was worthy to not just loose the bands of satan on your soul because john had already been loosed from that john had been loosed from the bands of satan in his soul but john knew if somebody didn't take a body change none of this was going to happen that was in that part we're going to see next sunday because we need to go we'll see how john i believe he saw a little something we got to read between the lines just keep reading revelation 5 and keep reading the breach about three weeks i should ask everybody next week everybody hold their hand up
