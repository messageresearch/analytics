[34:33] and laid him at your feet lord jesus
[34:34] knowing and confessing lord jesus that
[34:36] you're still able to to come and meet
[34:38] our knees lord jesus you're a need
[34:40] answering god
[34:41] lord we know that the answer to every
[34:43] need that we have is laying here in your
[34:45] word lord jesus and i pray god that
[34:47] you'll just let it rise from the pages
[34:48] lord jesus to meet every need that we
[34:50] have this afternoon in the name of the
[34:51] lord jesus christ
[34:53] amen
[34:58] it is a little bit hot up here i'm gonna
[34:59] go ahead and take this off
[35:02] joshua chapter 10
[35:07] and it says
[35:09] then speak joshua to the lord and the
[35:11] day when the lord delivered up the
[35:12] amorites before the children of israel
[35:14] and he said on the side of israel
[35:16] son stand thou still upon gabayan or
[35:20] gabon
[35:21] i did look up the pronunciation and
[35:24] believe it or not it's gabon
[35:26] [Music]
[35:27] and thou moon in the valley of agilent
[35:30] and the sun stood still and the moon
[35:32] stayed until the people had avenged
[35:34] themselves upon their enemies
[35:36] is not this written in the book of
[35:38] jasher so the sun stood still in the
[35:41] midst of heaven
[35:42] and hastened not to go down about a
[35:44] whole day
[35:45] and there was no day like that before or
[35:48] after it
[35:49] that the lord hearkened unto the voice
[35:51] of a man
[35:52] now think about that
[35:54] that the lord hearken under the voice of
[35:56] a man that a man would speak some words
[35:59] and nature
[36:00] would have to obey what that man spoke
[36:04] for the lord fought for israel
[36:07] and joshua returned in all israel with
[36:10] him unto the camp to gilgal you may be
[36:12] seated the lord has a blessing to the
[36:14] reading of the word
[36:17] so
[36:18] so
[36:19] that's maybe a an odd topic to take out
[36:21] of that scripture the miracle of life
[36:23] but i want to
[36:24] i want to uh
[36:26] maybe take it just kind of thought a
[36:28] thought for a few minutes on on what a
[36:30] miracle is and and you know how life is
[36:33] a miracle and you know we live in a time
[36:34] when when people don't believe in
[36:36] miracles anymore it seems like uh maybe
[36:39] maybe you sitting here this afternoon if
[36:42] kind of like brother aaron was preaching
[36:43] on this morning the devil begins to put
[36:45] thoughts in your mind and you begin to
[36:46] kind of lose
[36:48] lose sight of the fact that god is still
[36:50] a miracle working god and and there's
[36:52] more to the message than just learning
[36:54] things that we but we believe in a
[36:55] miracle working god we believe in a god
[36:57] that can affect change in our lives we
[37:00] believe in a god that can change your
[37:02] family that can change your home we
[37:03] believe in a god that can come on the
[37:05] scene and heal you and take whatever
[37:08] problem you've got whether it's
[37:11] problems with your hip or problems with
[37:12] your feet or problems with your head or
[37:14] wherever wherever your problems are and
[37:16] your body that god can touch touch those
[37:19] problems and meet that need because he's
[37:21] still a miracle working god
[37:24] and how do we know he's a miracle
[37:25] working god because he's still the same
[37:28] and we we know that's one of the most
[37:30] profound scriptures that he's the same
[37:32] yesterday today and forever
[37:34] because we know that if he if he the way
[37:38] that he acted when brother branham was
[37:41] here the way that he acted when jesus
[37:42] was here the way he acted when joshua
[37:45] stood and spoke to the moon and the sun
[37:48] we know
[37:49] that he's still the same today that he
[37:51] was back to you
[37:54] yeah excuse me i feel like i tapped into
[37:56] something
[37:58] now now brother branham when he preached
[38:00] the sermon the paradox and and he began
[38:03] to talk about how he kind of started off
[38:05] that sermon with he talked about how
[38:06] there was his brother that he kept
[38:08] coming for interviews with him and he
[38:10] kept he he wanted to be delivered of
[38:12] cigarettes now you think about that now
[38:14] he was coming to church and he had a
[38:15] problem with smoking cigarettes but they
[38:17] knew god was a miracle working god but
[38:19] yet within himself he just could not get
[38:22] rid of the cigarettes and brother
[38:23] branham said that he had like
[38:25] i think brother brown said he had like
[38:27] 50 interviews or
[38:29] you know he kept coming to brother
[38:31] branham over and over or trying maybe it
[38:33] was trying to schedule an interview he
[38:35] tried over and over to get an interview
[38:37] and time after time he couldn't get an
[38:39] interview but he knew that if he could
[38:41] just get get to brother branham
[38:43] why why get to brother brown
[38:46] because brother branham
[38:48] had a way that he could talk listen i
[38:50] want to just lay this out to so many
[38:52] times we think that brother branham had
[38:54] something that we don't have access to
[38:56] today
[38:57] we still have access to that same god
[39:01] if we can believe today god is still a
[39:03] miracle working god despite the fact
[39:06] that brother branham is off the scene
[39:08] despite the fact that we don't have
[39:09] access to jesus in the flesh we still
[39:12] have a miracle working god
[39:14] even though
[39:15] he's still the same
[39:17] now now
[39:19] his problem was he just needed to
[39:21] believe and when he finally got that
[39:24] audience with brother branham and he got
[39:25] sat in there and i don't know what
[39:27] brother branham told him but he fought
[39:29] brother mum said after trying all the
[39:31] psychology he finally got his miracle
[39:35] what was his miracle his miracle was he
[39:37] had tried and tried and tried to lay
[39:39] down the cigarettes and finally the
[39:42] cigarette problem was gone you see what
[39:45] a miracle life is when when the life of
[39:47] christ takes hold and you it change
[39:50] it'll change you it'll take those
[39:51] cigarettes and take all the drugs and
[39:53] take the alcohol and take the bad
[39:55] attitude and take the take the horrible
[39:58] spirit and take the argumentative stuff
[40:00] and take it all away from you and change
[40:02] you that's what a miracle life is that's
[40:05] what a miracle the life of christ is and
[40:08] it's a miracle when your chains are
[40:10] broken when you're chained down by
[40:12] depression and and agony and you think
[40:14] nobody cares about you and then life
[40:16] comes on this life the life of christ
[40:19] has set you free that is a miracle and
[40:22] brother adam said it's appear it's a
[40:24] paradox when something incredible
[40:26] without a reasonable explanation happens
[40:29] it seems incredible but yet it's true
[40:32] and you know what a paradox is it's a
[40:34] statement
[40:35] that is seemingly contradictory or
[40:38] opposed to common sense and yet is
[40:41] perhaps true and it's a paradox to think
[40:44] that the life of christ can come into a
[40:46] person and make them lay their
[40:48] cigarettes down and never pick them up
[40:50] again make them lay their bad habits
[40:52] down to change somebody from some being
[40:55] a horrible backwards person to somebody
[40:57] that's a real christian coming to church
[41:00] wanting to serve god that's a paradox
[41:02] and you can't explain it by reason you
[41:05] can't explain it by scientific you can't
[41:07] explain it by by making a list of all
[41:10] the things that you know with your own
[41:11] knowledge but it's something that's past
[41:13] understanding past finding out when god
[41:16] comes on the scene with his life changes
[41:19] the situation
[41:20] that's what a paradox is
[41:22] brotherham said now according to webster
[41:24] a paradox is something that seems
[41:26] incredible but it's true
[41:28] therefore a paradox then would be the
[41:30] same as a miracle a paradox is the same
[41:33] as a miracle
[41:35] a paradox is when something that seems
[41:37] like it just couldn't be the knowledge
[41:39] of the human mind it's all together
[41:42] incredible but yet it's proven true you
[41:45] see why christian you've got to have
[41:46] faith to believe in a miracle you can't
[41:49] you you're looking to the unseen you're
[41:51] looking past the things that your
[41:53] natural eye can see we believe in
[41:55] miracles i still believe in miracles and
[41:57] if you need a miracle this afternoon
[41:59] there's a way that you can get it
[42:01] there's a way that you can get whatever
[42:02] you have need of because we believe in a
[42:05] miracle-working god a god that can touch
[42:07] you with he's touched by the feeling of
[42:09] infirmities and this god can touch back
[42:12] he touches back by his word he speaks
[42:14] back and he can reach out and heal you
[42:17] whatever your need is whatever your
[42:19] problem is this afternoon he's he's
[42:21] still a miracle-working god he said now
[42:24] a miracle would be the same thing for a
[42:26] miracle cannot be explained
[42:28] a miracle is something that happens and
[42:30] you cannot explain it that makes it a
[42:33] paradox it's incredible but yet it's the
[42:36] truth
[42:37] and you are you are a miracle see now
[42:40] look looking out on the audience here
[42:42] that i'm looking at a lot of miracles
[42:44] it's a miracle that you're even here
[42:46] because you didn't come here by your
[42:48] reason or by the your knowledge but you
[42:50] came here because the life of christ
[42:51] called you and tugged at you and moved
[42:53] you tugged at you like hiding rights
[42:56] when hattie wright spoke that word over
[42:58] her children and the spirit of the lord
[43:00] began to move on her kids and tugged and
[43:02] removed them
[43:03] you're you're here because something got
[43:05] a hold of you and put you in this pew
[43:07] you heard the word preached and the life
[43:10] of god came on the scene and moved over
[43:12] your life and caused that seed that you
[43:14] received to come up and moved moved you
[43:17] into this pew and that makes you a
[43:19] miracle you say well brother bob i don't
[43:21] know if god does miracles anymore but
[43:23] you're you're proof that he still works
[43:25] miracles you're proof sitting here that
[43:27] god still works miracles
[43:30] brother abraham said i believe that
[43:32] every born-again member of the body of
[43:34] christ is a paradox in themselves
[43:36] i believe each one of you methodist and
[43:38] presbyterian and lutheran that never had
[43:40] experienced the baptism of the holy
[43:42] spirit was in some formal church
[43:46] listen how he puts this was some formal
[43:48] church that did not believe in the
[43:50] genuine new birth and has now received
[43:52] the baptism in the holy ghost
[43:54] that's a perfect example of a paradox
[43:57] because something happened to you that
[43:59] changed your whole being and anyone
[44:02] could look at that and know what a
[44:04] paradox is a miracle you think about
[44:06] that anybody can look at somebody that's
[44:09] been changed and know that they come out
[44:11] of drug addiction no they come out of
[44:13] their religious dogma know that they
[44:15] come out of their denominational system
[44:17] look at somebody like that and know that
[44:19] there's a miracle that took place in
[44:21] that person's life because god got a
[44:23] hold of them and changed them to be
[44:25] changed is a miracle if you've been
[44:28] changed this afternoon god has worked a
[44:30] miracle in your life that's a miracle
[44:32] being worked
[44:35] it's a miracle that the holy ghost can
[44:37] take a center and change them it's a
[44:39] miracle that god can do that a miracle
[44:42] because you you can't do it your own
[44:44] self you couldn't lay down your
[44:46] cigarettes and lay down your old life
[44:48] and make yourself change only god could
[44:50] do that it's only something that the
[44:52] holy spirit can do
[44:54] brother abraham he told this story about
[44:57] he was counseling this young young
[44:59] german man that he wanted to marry this
[45:01] little girl and he he treated her wrong
[45:03] somehow brother brother said there was a
[45:05] fine young man very fine boy he was
[45:07] going with a little girl
[45:08] very fine little girl out of a fine
[45:10] family and this boy all of a sudden come
[45:12] up with some kind of an idea and he just
[45:14] walked away he did something wrong to
[45:16] the little girl and as much as promised
[45:18] her to do a certain thing and then
[45:20] didn't do it and instead of coming to
[45:22] the girl and apologizing like a
[45:23] gentleman should do he it just wasn't in
[45:26] him to do it you see as much as you try
[45:29] to do right if it's not in you to do it
[45:32] it won't work and you see this young man
[45:34] that brother brown was talking about
[45:36] using as an example here he wasn't
[45:38] equipped with what with the life with
[45:41] the life on the inside the miracle work
[45:44] in life the kind of miracle work in life
[45:46] that would change you see he wasn't
[45:48] changed yet and because he wasn't
[45:51] changed he couldn't go to that girl and
[45:53] apologize he couldn't go to her and make
[45:56] it right you see he wasn't a you see
[45:59] why brother branham laid so many times
[46:01] down why how important it is to be born
[46:03] again first before you're married before
[46:06] you're married because once you get
[46:07] married and you're not born again you
[46:09] won't be able to apologize you won't
[46:11] you'll be all stubborn you'll have all
[46:13] that pride and stuff and it'll just make
[46:15] everything miserable you've got to be
[46:17] born again before you enter into
[46:18] something like that
[46:20] he said therefore the boy was a
[46:22] christian he was a christian as far as a
[46:24] believer
[46:25] he had repented and had been baptized
[46:27] and had his position among the believers
[46:29] but yet had not received the baptism of
[46:31] the holy spirit no matter how much he
[46:34] thought he had no matter how much he
[46:35] thought he had yet the life
[46:37] was not there
[46:39] the life that would make him live the
[46:41] life of a christian that would that
[46:44] i'm talking about the life that would
[46:46] make somebody stop living in fornication
[46:48] or adultery that life that would make
[46:50] somebody stop drinking life that would
[46:52] make somebody stop crowds and i'm pretty
[46:54] i'm coming down to the home level
[46:56] tonight i'm preaching about do you have
[46:58] that kind of a life in you tonight do
[47:00] you that kind of a life that will make
[47:02] you straighten up no matter how much he
[47:04] thought he had it yet the life was
[47:06] lacking in him and he said the father
[47:08] raised up and said my son went to the
[47:10] altar he was baptized correctly listen
[47:14] to the father is making all these
[47:15] excuses that's how so many times the
[47:17] parents will do the parents will jump in
[47:19] and say well yeah but my son was
[47:21] baptized yeah but my son goes to church
[47:23] yeah my child my child this and all that
[47:26] the parents
[47:27] if we'll get away if we get out of the
[47:29] way sometimes god can do can do
[47:31] something that's
[47:33] like i was saying this morning that's
[47:34] why i like camps
[47:37] because you know you can get these kids
[47:38] to go to camp and then mama and daddy
[47:40] ain't there to interfere the kids can
[47:41] make their own decision they're not
[47:43] going up the scene because mom and daddy
[47:44] forced them to do it they're not they're
[47:46] not going up to the altar because mom
[47:47] and dad pushed him up there but they're
[47:49] there to make their own decision mom and
[47:52] daddy are out of the way so they can do
[47:54] something many times mom and daddy gets
[47:56] in the way it just messes everything up
[47:58] and he said the father raised up and
[47:59] said my son went to the altar he was
[48:01] baptized correctly in the name of jesus
[48:03] christ excuse me in the name of jesus
[48:06] christ in water baptism in the pool
[48:08] you see sometimes sometimes you can't
[48:10] rely on what mama and daddy says you got
[48:13] to have your own experience you got to
[48:15] have your own experience he said i know
[48:18] my son has come to christ
[48:20] brother adam said that may be all right
[48:22] all the outward motions he might be
[48:24] identified as a believer with the
[48:25] believers but until he is regenerated
[48:27] born again
[48:29] i did now listen to this
[48:31] i know this hurts i know a lot of people
[48:32] disagree with this but he said i advise
[48:35] that young man to never marry a woman to
[48:38] never marry a woman he'll make hell on
[48:41] earth for her until that gentle
[48:43] sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes
[48:46] in now you're going to have people get
[48:48] married but he said he going to make
[48:49] hell on earth for it's going to be hell
[48:51] on earth for somebody to get married if
[48:53] they're not born again because their
[48:54] life is not there the life that has
[48:57] changed him from an old carl or somebody
[48:59] carl a man that wants to look at every
[49:01] woman on the beach that walks by a car a
[49:03] woman that wants to not not serve her
[49:05] husband and not do what's right a
[49:07] carnality god the miracle-working life
[49:10] of the holy spirit will take all the
[49:12] carnality out of you
[49:14] that's what being a real christian is
[49:16] about
[49:17] he said then that will be a paradox in
[49:19] itself to take the very nature of a boy
[49:21] that's bred between father and mother
[49:24] and yet in his intellectuals he is
[49:25] trying his best to overcome it he can't
[49:28] do it
[49:29] he'll never overcome it christ will have
[49:31] to overcome it when he lets christ in
[49:34] then he's already overcome then it'll be
[49:36] a perfect paradox when a man is born of
[49:39] the spirit of god
[49:41] do you realize what's happening when you
[49:42] get born of the spirit of god when
[49:44] you're born of your natural birth you
[49:46] come into the world with your with your
[49:48] natural genes of your mama and daddy you
[49:50] come into the world with your natural
[49:51] genes and and you're going to act like
[49:53] this german boy did he had all that
[49:55] stubbornness and pride like like his
[49:57] german ancestors did he had all that
[49:59] stuff that came down from his parents
[50:01] but when you get the new birth god gives
[50:04] you a different set of genes he starts
[50:06] aligning your character with his genes
[50:08] he starts taking over your life he
[50:10] starts claiming your life by the word
[50:13] the more word you hear is like god's
[50:15] staking something on you and saying this
[50:17] is mine and this is mine and this is
[50:19] mine and this is mine until he totally
[50:22] takes you over he takes you over that's
[50:24] what he wants to do is swallow you up in
[50:26] himself swallow you up until you're a
[50:28] living tabernacle of jesus christ christ
[50:31] made manifest in your members you see
[50:33] he's taken you over by his genes another
[50:36] set of genes you see that's the problem
[50:38] with you know a lot of ministers have a
[50:40] problem with people looking at
[50:41] horoscopes for that reason we're going
[50:43] to look at horoscope a horoscope might
[50:44] be good for your flesh or whatever if if
[50:47] it work i don't even believe there's no
[50:49] good in horoscopes to be honest i don't
[50:51] believe they're no good but if they're
[50:53] if if there were any good maybe it might
[50:55] be good for your flesh but we don't care
[50:57] about the flesh as christians
[50:59] you want to find you want to find out
[51:01] about your mama your way the genes from
[51:03] where you came from go look back to the
[51:05] word the word is what tells you how to
[51:07] live it tells you how to do how to dress
[51:09] how to clothe how to walk how to line up
[51:12] with god what god wants you to do
[51:15] horoscopes my
[51:17] horoscopes don't do nothing for a
[51:18] christian what good would a horoscope do
[51:20] for a christian what good would a
[51:22] horoscope do for somebody that that's
[51:24] not born again trying to figure out who
[51:25] they should marry or when they should
[51:27] get married when they should do all this
[51:28] kind of stuff look into the word of god
[51:30] and find out find out what the word of
[51:32] god says about things
[51:35] listen i
[51:36] i know sometimes that's hard preaching
[51:38] but it's it's the truth it's the truth
[51:41] we got to get back to the word to find
[51:42] out what the word says
[51:45] so many times we lean upon our own
[51:47] natural self we lean upon what our own
[51:50] our own natural genes can do i want to
[51:52] know what the spirit of god can do in my
[51:54] life because i believe in miracles i
[51:56] believe in a miracle working god a
[51:58] miracle-working god that can come upon
[52:00] the scene and take a sinner and make a
[52:02] saying out of them take a sinner and
[52:04] make a preacher out of them take a
[52:06] sinner and make somebody that god can
[52:08] tabernacle himself in and walk and use
[52:10] so make somebody a deacon a song leader
[52:13] somebody that's a real upstanding
[52:15] citizen in the community
[52:19] brother said i've seen critics staying
[52:21] stand off and make fun and carry on of a
[52:24] holy ghost revival and after a while god
[52:26] get a hold of that same man and change
[52:28] him
[52:29] and here he stands right in the pulpit
[52:31] preaching the same thing that he once
[52:33] hated
[52:34] it's a paradox how that god can take the
[52:36] unbeliever and make a mirror a believer
[52:38] out of him and make a believer out of
[52:40] him that's a miracle friends that's a
[52:42] miracle he said something
[52:44] something happened to you
[52:46] something happened to you that changed
[52:49] your whole being
[52:51] something happened to you that changed
[52:52] you
[52:53] and anyone could look at that and know
[52:55] what a paradox is
[52:57] a miracle
[53:00] why all because the word got a hold of
[53:02] your life
[53:03] now brother brown said i'll pray it's a
[53:05] paradox that the word holds everything
[53:06] together
[53:07] in hebrews 11 it says through faith we
[53:09] understand that the worlds were framed
[53:10] by the word of god so the things which
[53:12] are seen were not made of things which
[53:13] do appear
[53:16] brother brown talked about how you could
[53:17] look out on the and if you could look
[53:19] out in the galaxy and go like 150
[53:21] million light years and just go and go
[53:23] and go and then come back at 100 another
[53:24] 150 million years back we'd be going he
[53:27] said we'd be going from the earth 50
[53:29] years and how can our little how can our
[53:30] little minds understand something like
[53:32] that our little ant brains
[53:34] i put pictures in my notes just to kind
[53:36] of jog my memory and i got a picture of
[53:37] a little ant brain here
[53:40] because that's that's our little ant
[53:41] brain is trying to understand things how
[53:43] can your uh ant brain understand how
[53:45] that how that god can change your life
[53:47] how does he do it how did we probe at it
[53:50] and try to figure it out but it's a
[53:51] paradox because you can't explain it by
[53:54] scientific understanding you can't
[53:56] explain it by your reasoning all you
[53:58] know is that something got a hold of you
[54:00] and changed you and one day you were
[54:02] like this and the next day you were like
[54:04] this or maybe the next year or however
[54:05] long it took but something changed you
[54:08] and you're a miracle he said he talked
[54:10] about they talking about looking out
[54:11] into the galaxies and everything he said
[54:13] they broke in to find out eternity they
[54:15] say that john glenn the astronaut that
[54:17] went around it never taken one second
[54:19] off of his life
[54:20] even the speed that he was traveling
[54:22] about 1700 miles
[54:24] so then see we broke into eternity we're
[54:27] an earthbound people that knows just
[54:28] inches and so forth when you break into
[54:30] that unknown you can't fathom that our
[54:33] minds are not comprehensive
[54:35] our little minds are not comprehensive
[54:37] enough to understand we we couldn't we
[54:39] couldn't fathom what it means to get
[54:40] into that but we know that it's true
[54:43] we know what's true we don't understand
[54:45] all the ins and outs of how it happened
[54:46] but we know it's true and that's what a
[54:48] paradox is
[54:49] he's so something something beyond our
[54:52] comprehension is what framed everything
[54:54] up something beyond what we can imagine
[54:57] is what's holding the world together the
[54:59] universe together something beyond what
[55:01] is it it's the miracle of life what life
[55:04] god's life eternal life life is holding
[55:07] everything up that life that's holding
[55:09] everything up is the same life that can
[55:11] come and change an individual
[55:14] he said einstein said there's only one
[55:16] sensible thing to say about the world by
[55:18] faith we understand that god framed the
[55:20] world together see and the world
[55:22] standing there at space it had to come
[55:23] from somewhere
[55:25] now this is what einstein really
[55:26] literally said he said every scientist
[55:28] becomes convinced that the laws of
[55:30] nature manifest the existence of a
[55:31] spirit
[55:32] vastly superior to that of men
[55:34] somewhere out there he said i don't
[55:36] understand it but there's something out
[55:38] there where everything came from
[55:40] this firm belief in a superior mind that
[55:42] reveals itself in the world of
[55:43] experience represents my conception of
[55:45] god and einstein said behind all the
[55:48] discernible concatenations there remains
[55:50] something subtle and tangible and
[55:52] inexplicable veneration for this force
[55:54] is my religion to that extent i am in
[55:56] fact point of fact religious so einstein
[55:59] with all his scientific knowledge had i
[56:01] had to acknowledge
[56:02] there was something out there that was
[56:04] holding everything up that's something
[56:06] out there that's holding everything up
[56:08] that's that thing that got a hold of
[56:09] your life and changed you
[56:11] how it stands in space
[56:13] how everything stands in space but we
[56:15] find out here that joshua
[56:17] joshua was stopping the sun
[56:20] joshua stopped the sun with his word now
[56:23] that's a paradox
[56:24] he said it's a paradox but god did it
[56:26] anyhow what by a man not a god not some
[56:29] great angel coming down from heaven a
[56:31] man with faith in the mission that he
[56:33] was given to take that land the word of
[56:36] god was behind it i give you this land
[56:40] and everywhere the soles of your foot
[56:42] shall set upon that i give you
[56:44] it's yours
[56:46] now how did he do it
[56:48] how how did he unleash the power of life
[56:51] that miracle working power to stop the
[56:53] sun
[56:54] now brother branham lays he lays an
[56:56] outline out for us that we can follow
[57:01] i'm laughing because you know sometimes
[57:03] in the middle of the sermon everybody
[57:04] takes a nap and then they wake up later
[57:05] that's all right
[57:08] that's all right get you get your rest
[57:10] out
[57:14] no we were talking to a minister that
[57:16] one time and he said you know sometimes
[57:18] people fall asleep because you know they
[57:19] they have a hard time at home they have
[57:21] a hard time sleeping the night before
[57:22] and they get in church and there's a
[57:24] peace there there's a comfort that you
[57:26] can't find anywhere else maybe sometimes
[57:29] people need need that little place where
[57:31] you kind of
[57:32] get you get
[57:34] so i give grace a little bit
[57:39] but the achievement listen listen to how
[57:40] brother brown lays this out he said the
[57:42] achievement he was trying to do see he
[57:44] had he he was trying to do something
[57:46] his enemy now if you go back and read
[57:48] this bible story about how how this
[57:50] happened he uh there was a city named
[57:53] gabon that had ally themselves with
[57:55] israel because honestly they got a
[57:57] little bit scared and they said they saw
[57:58] israel destroying all these other cities
[58:00] and all these other places and they said
[58:02] okay we're gonna you know what we're
[58:04] gonna ally ourselves with israel don't
[58:06] please don't attack us then another king
[58:08] rose up and he's he came after gabon so
[58:11] here comes joshua he comes he's go goes
[58:13] to defend gabon and he comes on the
[58:15] scene and god begins to work up a mighty
[58:18] there you can read the story about how
[58:19] they were they were striking the enemy
[58:21] down and they were driving them out and
[58:23] god began to rain hailstones down on
[58:25] them health stones big enough to you
[58:26] know a lot of times we go out in the
[58:28] yard and we're worried about the in our
[58:29] insurance claim because it might dent
[58:31] our car a little bit but these hail
[58:33] stones were knocking people down and
[58:35] killing them and and and joshua began to
[58:37] look on the situation and he saw them
[58:39] running for their lives and but yet the
[58:41] sun was going down so he knew he knew
[58:44] that god had given them that land for an
[58:46] inheritance and and defeating those
[58:49] enemies was part of the promise that god
[58:51] had given him so he looked at that in
[58:53] other words he had he had a purpose in
[58:55] his mind it wasn't he wasn't just
[58:57] randomly speaking to the sun but there
[58:59] was a purpose he began to look with
[59:00] desperation the sun's going down and the
[59:03] moon's coming up
[59:04] and something's something's got to
[59:06] happen otherwise we're going to loot
[59:07] we're going to go into the next day
[59:08] where they're going to be able to hide
[59:10] at night they're going to be able to get
[59:11] away we got to kill these enemies
[59:15] he wasn't he wasn't willing to let one
[59:18] of the enemy go get away he wasn't let
[59:21] think about how that's how we should be
[59:23] without without all of our our cancer
[59:25] problems and our problems with our
[59:27] eyesight and things if god said it let's
[59:30] pursue it let's if you've got the if
[59:32] you've got the promise of god backing
[59:34] you up
[59:35] let's have the faith that joshua did if
[59:38] god said that you can have it like i was
[59:41] thinking his brother aaron was preaching
[59:42] this morning as he was talking about the
[59:43] children of israel going through the
[59:44] wilderness if god if god was able to
[59:48] heal them as they went through the
[59:50] wilderness to give them everything that
[59:52] they need whatever what about us god
[59:54] wants you to be healed in your body he
[59:56] doesn't want not one of us to be in the
[59:58] firm in our body he wants us to go into
[1:00:00] the rapture believing and
[1:00:02] change he wants us to be he wants you to
[1:00:04] be healed so you can serve him he wants
[1:00:06] you to he he don't want ministers with
[1:00:08] vocal cord problems so that you can't
[1:00:10] preach he wants you to be able to preach
[1:00:12] he wants you to be able to think he
[1:00:13] wants you to be able to serve him with
[1:00:15] every capacity in your being so when you
[1:00:17] come like that that's how joshua came he
[1:00:20] knew that god had laid the promise out
[1:00:22] there and it was god god wanted him to
[1:00:24] defeat the enemy and that's why he was
[1:00:27] able to speak
[1:00:28] because he knew what god wanted done
[1:00:31] with the word
[1:00:32] you see why it's so important to come to
[1:00:34] a place where you know what god wants
[1:00:35] done with the word
[1:00:38] i believe that bride is coming to a
[1:00:39] place where she knows how to get born
[1:00:41] again what the born-again experience is
[1:00:44] what the word does to you what what
[1:00:46] effect the word has what what that life
[1:00:49] in you that's been doing all this time
[1:00:51] what that is she knows what's taking
[1:00:53] place and she knows what god wants done
[1:00:55] with the word that's why joshua was able
[1:00:57] to speak
[1:00:58] he said the achievement he was trying to
[1:01:00] do see his enemy was routed and he knew
[1:01:04] if the sun ever set them kings would get
[1:01:06] together and they'd come back upon him
[1:01:07] with double forces
[1:01:09] and brother baum said whatever god did i
[1:01:11] don't know
[1:01:12] but the sun stood still
[1:01:14] the moon over agilent because a man
[1:01:17] a human being
[1:01:18] a human being
[1:01:20] was in the line of duty
[1:01:22] now now see the point is nobody maybe
[1:01:24] nobody can explain that but it happened
[1:01:27] it happened joshua probably didn't even
[1:01:28] know how it happened but he knew it
[1:01:31] happened because they fought and they
[1:01:33] fought another day while the sun was
[1:01:35] standing up now maybe you have some
[1:01:37] maybe you can find some quotes to
[1:01:38] explain how it happened but you might be
[1:01:40] missing the point it's not that you know
[1:01:43] how everything happened it's just that
[1:01:44] you believe god's word and trust in him
[1:01:47] and and believe that there's a miracle
[1:01:49] working god that can change things
[1:01:51] you see so he had he had what he had a
[1:01:54] reason he had a reason for doing that
[1:01:56] brother brown said of course you got to
[1:01:57] have a reason for it you can't have
[1:01:59] faith unless you've got some reason as i
[1:02:01] tried to say last night some people's
[1:02:02] faith is in their textbook some people's
[1:02:05] faith is in something else but depends
[1:02:07] on where your faith is me and brother
[1:02:09] curtis were walking through a christian
[1:02:10] bookstore the other day and and they got
[1:02:12] there's all kinds of books that you
[1:02:14] could look and say well i got faith in
[1:02:15] this book i got faith in this man that
[1:02:17] was a book on elijah i got faith in this
[1:02:19] man's interpretation of elijah
[1:02:22] i wouldn't i you know i got faith in
[1:02:24] brother branham's interpretation of
[1:02:25] elijah i got faith in what this bible
[1:02:27] says about elijah i got faith in this so
[1:02:30] having faith in a textbook is one thing
[1:02:32] but having the faith in the word of god
[1:02:34] here's your reason the reason is god
[1:02:37] promised god he said
[1:02:39] he promised that he would heal you he
[1:02:41] promised that he would save you
[1:02:44] so if you have a reason
[1:02:46] and is it his will and he said i want to
[1:02:48] believe god's word what he says is true
[1:02:49] then i've got to see whether it's his
[1:02:51] will or not
[1:02:52] his will and his will is his word like
[1:02:54] romans 12 2 says be not conformed to
[1:02:56] this world but be transformed by the
[1:02:58] renewing of your mind that ye may prove
[1:03:01] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:03:03] perfect will of god
[1:03:05] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:03:07] mind how by the word of god to prove his
[1:03:10] will to prove his will out what we have
[1:03:12] is will the bible says in psalm 33 the
[1:03:15] council of the lord his word standeth
[1:03:17] forever the council of the lord standeth
[1:03:19] forever the thoughts of his heart to all
[1:03:22] generations we've got the counsel of the
[1:03:24] lord
[1:03:25] do you realize how perplexing that is to
[1:03:26] people
[1:03:28] you you want to find out the will of god
[1:03:30] and you and you go and you and you pray
[1:03:32] you might pray and and maybe the lord
[1:03:34] will send you uh something supernatural
[1:03:36] maybe he'll give you a dream but that
[1:03:37] dream might be of the devil maybe he'll
[1:03:39] give you maybe he'll let you see a light
[1:03:41] but it might might be false maybe it
[1:03:43] might be false you see you've got to
[1:03:45] take everything back to the word you've
[1:03:47] got to compare it because his word is
[1:03:48] his will and somebody say well i i
[1:03:51] believe the lord is leading me to do a
[1:03:52] certain thing but yet they're not coming
[1:03:54] to church and they're not they're not
[1:03:56] doing what the word says the word is his
[1:03:59] will
[1:04:00] that's why jesus said in matthew chapter
[1:04:02] 7 not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:04:04] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:04:06] heaven but he he that doeth the will of
[1:04:08] my father which is in heaven the will
[1:04:11] the will of the father is his word and
[1:04:13] if you're walking in the word you're
[1:04:15] walking in his will
[1:04:17] one of my favorite stories in the bible
[1:04:19] is in first kings chapter 13 where the
[1:04:20] prophet comes on the scene and he god
[1:04:22] tells him to go down and to prophesy his
[1:04:25] prophecy is that one day a little boy is
[1:04:28] going to born
[1:04:29] will be born named josiah and he's going
[1:04:31] to tear down all the altars of the lord
[1:04:34] and he said
[1:04:35] during his prophecy he's prophesied that
[1:04:37] the altar that he's prophesying over is
[1:04:39] going to be rent whether they're
[1:04:40] worshiping false gods and he makes his
[1:04:42] prophecy and you can go ring it read it
[1:04:43] in first first kings chapter 13
[1:04:46] lots of different things happen and they
[1:04:48] get upset with him and go fight him and
[1:04:49] then on the way home god told him don't
[1:04:52] turn to the right hand or to the left
[1:04:53] hand you see he had the will of the lord
[1:04:57] god told him his word what to do he said
[1:04:59] don't you turn to the right hand or to
[1:05:01] the left hand but you just go home
[1:05:03] and out of the bushes comes another
[1:05:05] prophet and says i the lord told me the
[1:05:08] bible says he's told him a lie he said
[1:05:10] the lord told me to tell you to come to
[1:05:13] my house and he had maybe a see you
[1:05:16] can't look at supernatural vindications
[1:05:18] necessarily you got to take everything
[1:05:21] back to the word
[1:05:22] everything has got to go back to the
[1:05:24] word even if even if a prophet comes out
[1:05:26] what if a prophet were to tell you you
[1:05:28] don't need to go to church no more what
[1:05:29] if a prophet were to come out and say
[1:05:31] well well we don't believe in the
[1:05:32] five-fold ministry anymore
[1:05:34] what would you take would you take would
[1:05:36] you rip ephesians 4 out of your bible
[1:05:38] would you rip all the scriptures out of
[1:05:40] your bible that talks about the forsake
[1:05:42] not the assembling together of
[1:05:44] yourselves even as you see the day
[1:05:45] approaching would you take that by that
[1:05:47] part of your see say yeah you got to
[1:05:49] take everything back to the word even if
[1:05:52] a prophet comes out of the bushes and
[1:05:54] tells you something contrary you take
[1:05:56] everything back to the word it's all it
[1:05:58] all goes back to the word and so brother
[1:06:01] brown in the message perseverance he
[1:06:02] said you must first find the will of god
[1:06:04] before you can do the will of god you
[1:06:07] must first know what his will is in the
[1:06:09] matter and then don't turn it loose
[1:06:12] and in the token he said now let me tell
[1:06:13] you by his word he cannot go contrary to
[1:06:16] that word he's already purchased your
[1:06:18] desire if it's according to his will and
[1:06:21] his will is to heal his will is to give
[1:06:25] you your desire
[1:06:27] so if you know what his will is his will
[1:06:30] is for you to be healed in your body
[1:06:33] even if you're maybe slumbering this
[1:06:34] afternoon and not not paying attention
[1:06:36] to the words that are being spoken but
[1:06:38] yet it's still the truth the truth his
[1:06:40] will is for you to be healed his will is
[1:06:42] debut for you to be filled with the holy
[1:06:44] ghost his will is for you to be for your
[1:06:47] for your nature to be changed to be like
[1:06:49] him
[1:06:52] then you if you have the right motive he
[1:06:54] said then if his will if his will i got
[1:06:57] to go check out my objective to it and
[1:06:58] my motive in doing it
[1:07:01] if i do it because i say well i'm going
[1:07:02] over the mountain here there's a
[1:07:03] mountain before me there's a million
[1:07:05] people on that side perishing
[1:07:08] i got a hundred million over here i'm
[1:07:10] preaching to
[1:07:11] well if i can't get over around or under
[1:07:13] the mountain or nothing and yet
[1:07:14] something in my heart keep telling me go
[1:07:16] over the mountain go to them
[1:07:18] now jesus said
[1:07:21] they shall move this mountain
[1:07:24] if god wants you to go to the other side
[1:07:26] of that mountain and your motive is
[1:07:28] right and your reason is right and
[1:07:30] everything's lining up you're going over
[1:07:32] that other side of that mountain so it's
[1:07:34] time to speak the word speak the word
[1:07:36] what are you talking about brother
[1:07:37] brother i'm talking about say by his
[1:07:39] stripes i am healed
[1:07:41] by his tribes i'm healed and speak it
[1:07:43] what are you speaking you're speaking
[1:07:44] what god already spoke
[1:07:46] you're saying what he's already said and
[1:07:48] you're when you speak it you're you're
[1:07:51] following your confession your body will
[1:07:53] follow your confession and to what you
[1:07:55] say speak it and watch the kawasaki come
[1:07:57] to pass say i believe that my body is
[1:08:00] going to be changed speak it and walk
[1:08:02] into it
[1:08:04] now the first thing i'll have to say
[1:08:05] brother i said now if your motive is
[1:08:07] money if i go over here this sign can
[1:08:09] only pay me so much and over there see
[1:08:11] my motive is not my right my objective
[1:08:14] is not right or what if i say what i
[1:08:16] don't care about money but if i go over
[1:08:18] there they're going to be
[1:08:19] they'll build me up a big monument a big
[1:08:21] old statue and i can look
[1:08:23] you know he said brother i'm the great
[1:08:25] missionary this then still my motive is
[1:08:27] not right if you're looking for
[1:08:29] popularity if you're looking for money
[1:08:31] or those kind of things but if your
[1:08:32] motive is to seek god's word fulfilled
[1:08:35] then speak it and go forward speak it he
[1:08:38] said but when i don't care when i don't
[1:08:41] care if they ever know who went over
[1:08:43] there to the other side of the mountain
[1:08:45] well i don't care about my popularity or
[1:08:47] my reputation when i don't care that all
[1:08:50] i know is he's just in my heart then
[1:08:52] i'll speak to that mountain and it will
[1:08:54] happen
[1:08:55] then i'll speak to that mountain and
[1:08:57] it'll happen it will happen
[1:08:59] it will happen why because that will
[1:09:01] unleash the life of christ it'll unleash
[1:09:04] the miracle working god god can move
[1:09:06] then when somebody that's filled up with
[1:09:09] christ speaks his word
[1:09:11] something will happen he said see your
[1:09:13] motive and your objective depends on who
[1:09:15] you are and what business he said that's
[1:09:18] where the church misses it so far they
[1:09:19] get worked up in an emotion
[1:09:22] and first thing you know in enthusiasm
[1:09:24] you don't stop to check it back here
[1:09:26] again
[1:09:27] check there
[1:09:28] stop to check it back here again
[1:09:31] check there for sure
[1:09:33] then it's thus saith the lord see
[1:09:36] whether it's right you see what god
[1:09:38] god's molding us into he's bringing up
[1:09:40] building us up precept by precept word
[1:09:43] by word into a place where we know what
[1:09:45] god wants done with the word we know
[1:09:48] whether god wants us to go to that mount
[1:09:49] the other side
[1:09:50] we know whether god wants us to be
[1:09:52] healed or not god wants you to be healed
[1:09:55] god wants you to be healed and he's
[1:09:56] still a miracle working god
[1:09:58] he said if you have the right reason the
[1:10:00] right listen the right reason
[1:10:02] the right objective and you know what
[1:10:05] his will is
[1:10:06] the mountain will move
[1:10:08] if you got the right reason
[1:10:10] and the right objective
[1:10:12] and you know what his will is and you've
[1:10:14] got his will the mountain will move
[1:10:18] joshua had a commission to go over and
[1:10:20] to take that land and god caused the
[1:10:22] great paradox because all of those
[1:10:23] things were met he had a reason he had
[1:10:25] an objective and it was god's will and
[1:10:27] he knew it now listen moses had a
[1:10:29] commission to bring those people out of
[1:10:30] egypt to that mountain there it was in
[1:10:32] the line of duty moses began to cry unto
[1:10:35] god when he said that saw the pillar of
[1:10:36] fire hanging up there and there come
[1:10:38] pharaoh's chariots and he cried and god
[1:10:40] said why are you crying to me i
[1:10:42] commissioned you to do it speak and go
[1:10:44] forward it was god's you remember well
[1:10:46] if you go back and read the sermon why
[1:10:48] christ speak
[1:10:49] or listen to it that whole sermon
[1:10:51] brother brown is building up to the play
[1:10:53] he's building all the background of
[1:10:55] moses all the things that happened in
[1:10:56] his life and finally he got to the
[1:10:58] culminating point
[1:10:59] aren't don't you know what i called you
[1:11:01] for and then moses is crying and he said
[1:11:04] don't cry to me just speak because he
[1:11:06] had a commission and a commission is an
[1:11:08] instruction a command or duty given to a
[1:11:11] person or group of people a formal
[1:11:14] written authorization to perform various
[1:11:16] acts and duties and we've got a formal
[1:11:19] written authorization to perform various
[1:11:22] acts and duties this is our
[1:11:24] authorization what kind of authorization
[1:11:27] we've got the authority that in my name
[1:11:29] they shall cast out devils
[1:11:31] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:11:33] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:11:35] any deadly thing and it shall not harm
[1:11:36] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:11:38] and they shall recover we've got god's
[1:11:41] written authority to speak his word to
[1:11:44] perform his word to believe his word to
[1:11:46] go and see the miracle working life of
[1:11:48] christ work miracles
[1:11:51] the trouble of it is today
[1:11:53] brother ram said the churches speak
[1:11:56] look like say
[1:11:58] well what did moody say
[1:12:00] well what did sankey say
[1:12:02] but the question is what did god say
[1:12:06] you could go into the christian
[1:12:07] bookstore and look at all the different
[1:12:09] commentaries on the wall of of a.w pink
[1:12:11] and e.w bullinger and they go on and on
[1:12:14] and clarence larkin and what did they
[1:12:15] say but what did god say that's why the
[1:12:18] message is so so such a blessing in this
[1:12:21] hour that god has he's downloaded the
[1:12:23] revelation the correct interpretation of
[1:12:25] the whole bible to us that when you get
[1:12:28] into the message just like you get a all
[1:12:29] of a sudden you get a bible phd
[1:12:33] you you get a supernatural understanding
[1:12:36] of everything from genesis to revelation
[1:12:38] because
[1:12:41] because we know what god said
[1:12:43] now we know now we know how to baptize
[1:12:45] we know how to how many whether there's
[1:12:48] one god or or three we know
[1:12:51] from the end from the beginning and
[1:12:53] brother brown said speak and say what
[1:12:55] god said amen
[1:12:57] let's go forward
[1:13:00] not go look you know that's what the
[1:13:01] commission to the church was speak and
[1:13:03] go forward
[1:13:05] don't ever go back
[1:13:08] christians don't go back we go forward
[1:13:11] because the same one that was with moses
[1:13:13] is with the ministry of today
[1:13:15] speaking the word over the people if
[1:13:18] you'll just speak the word
[1:13:20] the mountain will move
[1:13:22] if you'll speak at the mountain world
[1:13:23] speak what speak it his will
[1:13:25] is for you to be delivered
[1:13:28] his will is for you to be born again
[1:13:30] his will is for you to grow in grace and
[1:13:33] knowledge just like jesus did his will
[1:13:35] is for you to come into maturity his
[1:13:37] will is for your body to be healed
[1:13:40] i hope nobody leaves this afternoon
[1:13:42] wondering if god wants you to be healed
[1:13:44] that's his will is for your body to be
[1:13:47] healed his will is for you to have peace
[1:13:50] in your mind so if you're in trouble
[1:13:52] this afternoon troubled in your mind and
[1:13:54] can't sleep tossing and turning at night
[1:13:56] on your bed of pain his will is for you
[1:13:59] to be delivered of that
[1:14:00] so speak it and go forward i believe
[1:14:03] that that's your will for my life and
[1:14:05] walk into your confession
[1:14:07] speak it listen moses got to a place
[1:14:10] where he was there and the waters were
[1:14:12] all in front of him and god told him to
[1:14:13] speak and he spoke the word and the
[1:14:16] waters parted he spoke and the egyptians
[1:14:19] couldn't explain it with all their
[1:14:20] science with all their technology they
[1:14:22] couldn't understand how the waters
[1:14:24] parted they tried to ride in there and
[1:14:26] impersonate some things and ride through
[1:14:28] there and get to the other side and the
[1:14:29] waters closed in on them because it was
[1:14:32] a paradox they couldn't explain it but
[1:14:34] yet it happened
[1:14:35] something happened god moved that water
[1:14:38] aside because a man got a hold of god in
[1:14:41] the channel of god and spoke his word
[1:14:44] and you've got that same commission that
[1:14:47] moses had to speak the word and go
[1:14:49] forward
[1:14:52] you think about
[1:14:53] all those all those children of israel
[1:14:55] going through that water and then going
[1:14:57] through the wilderness two million
[1:14:59] people in the middle of a paradox and
[1:15:02] not realizing that god was working a
[1:15:04] miracle wandering wondering as they
[1:15:06] walked through the wilderness when god
[1:15:08] gave him water from a rock and god gave
[1:15:10] him food from heaven wondering if god
[1:15:12] still loved him and they were right in
[1:15:13] the middle of a paradox could you be in
[1:15:15] the middle of a paradox right now
[1:15:18] wondering what wondering if god still
[1:15:20] works miracles when god's opened the
[1:15:22] windows of heaven for you they wondered
[1:15:24] for if god still loved them they kept
[1:15:26] longing for their leaks and onions in
[1:15:28] egypt they were wondering if god really
[1:15:31] was with moses wondering if god really
[1:15:33] was with the ministry i wonder how many
[1:15:35] people today are wondering if god really
[1:15:38] is on the scene i wonder if that really
[1:15:40] is god speaking through the ministry
[1:15:42] wondering if they really could defeat
[1:15:44] the giants or not after all that god had
[1:15:47] done for him after all the miracles that
[1:15:49] they had seen going after golden calves
[1:15:51] and yet they were actually walking in a
[1:15:54] miracle
[1:15:55] they had a smitten rock that followed
[1:15:57] them they had the water coming from the
[1:15:59] rock all they had to do was walk out and
[1:16:01] gather food off the ground every morning
[1:16:03] maybe it took a little bit of time to
[1:16:05] gather up the man off the ground and
[1:16:06] pick it up but they were living in a
[1:16:08] miracle and they didn't realize it and
[1:16:10] the paradox says you are a miracle god
[1:16:13] is changing your life as you receive the
[1:16:15] word do you recognize that you're a
[1:16:18] miracle it was a paradox when joshua and
[1:16:21] caleb stood strong and believed that god
[1:16:24] was able
[1:16:26] two of them brother ben preached that
[1:16:27] sermon one in a million because there
[1:16:29] was two million out there and one in a
[1:16:31] million believed against all the odds
[1:16:33] they all came against them because while
[1:16:35] they began to look for scientific
[1:16:36] reasoning they began to look for
[1:16:38] something with their with their
[1:16:40] intellectual knowledge that they could
[1:16:41] grasp a hold to but a paradox is
[1:16:44] something that's beyond be past finding
[1:16:47] out beyond anything that you could
[1:16:48] understand with your own knowledge
[1:16:50] he said it was a paradox to see a
[1:16:53] handful of people
[1:16:55] unarmed almost but what they had picked
[1:16:57] up on the deserts and where they had
[1:16:59] chased other man probably with such as
[1:17:01] old rakes and sauce
[1:17:03] and whatever they could get a hold of
[1:17:05] when they finally came into the promised
[1:17:07] land a paradox to see a bunch of people
[1:17:09] like that with rakes and sauls come and
[1:17:11] take over the enemy and sweep through
[1:17:13] the land
[1:17:15] a paradox to see the walls of jericho
[1:17:17] fall to the ground
[1:17:18] it was a paradox when noah preached the
[1:17:20] word to a scientific age
[1:17:22] noah had a commission
[1:17:25] what was his commission that destruction
[1:17:27] is coming isn't that what malachi 4 it
[1:17:29] talks about that just before the great
[1:17:31] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:17:33] god will send a message and god sent a
[1:17:35] message back then that destruction is
[1:17:37] coming to get in the ark and what's our
[1:17:40] arc now to get into christ and noah
[1:17:42] preached to an intellectual world like
[1:17:44] we're preaching through now a day when
[1:17:46] they were farther advanced in science
[1:17:48] than we are now
[1:17:49] he said we could never build a pyramid
[1:17:51] they say they say they built that
[1:17:52] pyramid by by a bunch of people pushing
[1:17:54] it up a sledge or something brother
[1:17:56] brown talked about how that you could
[1:17:58] get a train car out on the train tracks
[1:17:59] and put grease all grease the wheels all
[1:18:01] up underneath and put a whole bunch of
[1:18:03] people behind that you won't be able to
[1:18:04] move that train car and it's got wheels
[1:18:09] in other words they had all kinds of
[1:18:11] scientific understanding they had way
[1:18:13] more scientific advancement than we do
[1:18:15] and they had all that scientific
[1:18:17] knowledge with all their instruments to
[1:18:19] look up into the heavens and say there
[1:18:20] ain't no rain where's the rain gonna
[1:18:22] come from but yet god said it
[1:18:25] what's the point brother bob we know all
[1:18:27] this kind of stuff we we've heard we've
[1:18:29] rehearsed all this in our mind before
[1:18:31] but the point is you can't reason out of
[1:18:33] body change in your mind how it's going
[1:18:35] to happen but yet god said you can't
[1:18:37] reason out in your mind how god's gonna
[1:18:40] heal that hip problem how god's gonna
[1:18:42] heal that back problem you can't reason
[1:18:44] it out in your mind but yet god's word
[1:18:46] said it and that's a paradox a paradox
[1:18:49] is when a miracle happens and you can't
[1:18:51] explain it how you gonna explain it when
[1:18:53] you go and you tell people at work i
[1:18:55] don't know what happened on the cat scan
[1:18:58] but something happened and it ain't the
[1:19:00] same as it was before i took the cat
[1:19:02] scan before i took the x-ray i don't
[1:19:04] know what happened all i know is i ain't
[1:19:06] the same all i know is god came in and
[1:19:09] took over
[1:19:13] noah only
[1:19:15] listen they had all that science but
[1:19:17] noah only had the word of the lord and
[1:19:19] the face of all that science
[1:19:22] noah only had the word of the lord noah
[1:19:25] had a revelation of what the will of god
[1:19:27] was to do noah had a revelation that he
[1:19:30] needed to build that ark and he went
[1:19:31] through three pulls just like we're
[1:19:33] going through three pools god told him
[1:19:35] to build that ark and he got started and
[1:19:37] then he labored and he labored and
[1:19:38] labored and then finally the day came
[1:19:41] when they went in there and god shut the
[1:19:43] door in a third pool they were in there
[1:19:45] and he was maybe it came time to look
[1:19:47] out there and all those that have
[1:19:49] rejected the message and the third pool
[1:19:51] were preaching to the lost they wanted
[1:19:53] to get in then but the door was shut
[1:19:57] noah only had the word of the lord in
[1:19:59] the face of all their science against
[1:20:01] all their instruments he knew it was
[1:20:03] going to rain he knew destruction was
[1:20:05] coming he knew the way of escape he knew
[1:20:08] he was going to build an ark he knew
[1:20:10] he knew what god wanted done with his
[1:20:13] word
[1:20:14] he knew he knew it was going to reign he
[1:20:17] knew the recipe to get out he knew to
[1:20:20] build an ark he knew how to build an ark
[1:20:23] the brothers were telling me that
[1:20:24] they went some of y'all went to the see
[1:20:26] that that art
[1:20:27] model that they built up north
[1:20:29] and you can walk around and look i
[1:20:31] haven't been but
[1:20:32] they tell me how amazing it is to see to
[1:20:35] think about a man that would know have
[1:20:37] the knowledge to build something that
[1:20:39] like that that god would architect
[1:20:41] something like that and give him a
[1:20:42] revelation of how to get out of here of
[1:20:45] how to go to another world another a
[1:20:48] world without sin a world that had been
[1:20:50] cleaned off a world that had been pursed
[1:20:52] and yet noah couldn't prove a thing
[1:20:55] noah couldn't prove that his message was
[1:20:57] right how would he prove it did noah
[1:21:00] have any did noah have a pillar of fire
[1:21:02] come down out of the cloud did noah have
[1:21:04] any kind of scientific proof he all he
[1:21:07] had was a message that god had given him
[1:21:10] a message that god proved one day to be
[1:21:12] right and you know what those people
[1:21:14] they had to either believe what he was
[1:21:16] saying was right or they didn't believe
[1:21:18] it they had two choices either believe
[1:21:20] what he said was right or not believe it
[1:21:23] and you've got that same choice today
[1:21:27] one day it'll be proven out but for now
[1:21:30] you've got to you've got to take it or
[1:21:31] leave it you've got to accept it by the
[1:21:33] preaching of the world whether or not
[1:21:35] this matches up by the bible or not noah
[1:21:37] said it's going to happen anyhow see and
[1:21:40] it rained that was a paradoxy something
[1:21:43] that could not be explained
[1:21:45] but god shook the earth around just in
[1:21:48] condition so it would rain
[1:21:50] so you see it was a paradox for noah to
[1:21:52] do that
[1:21:53] why did god do it that way
[1:21:56] god did it that way
[1:21:58] because he was going to do it again
[1:22:00] in the last days
[1:22:02] he's doing the same thing again noah
[1:22:04] preached to a scientific age of a bunch
[1:22:06] of unbelieving people people that didn't
[1:22:08] even eventually
[1:22:09] weren't even swayed by his message and
[1:22:11] the bible says in matthew 24 as it was
[1:22:14] in the days of noah so shall also the
[1:22:16] coming of the son of man be
[1:22:18] for as
[1:22:19] as in the days that were before the
[1:22:20] flood they were eaten and drinking and
[1:22:22] married and giving in marriage until the
[1:22:24] day that noah entered into the ark
[1:22:26] listen they were they were they were
[1:22:28] going through life
[1:22:29] until noah went into the ark
[1:22:31] there was not a lot of bad things
[1:22:33] happening they just they went into the
[1:22:35] art one day and it called everybody off
[1:22:37] guard and it'll catch people off guard
[1:22:39] today because the bible says that they
[1:22:42] were eating and drinking they were
[1:22:44] having their parties they were marrying
[1:22:46] and giving in marriage they're going
[1:22:48] about life building putting up
[1:22:50] skyscrapers tearing down skyscrapers
[1:22:52] building houses building new
[1:22:54] subdivisions going along doing the same
[1:22:56] thing and all of a sudden the son of man
[1:22:58] comes on the scene and people don't
[1:23:00] recognize it people are called away the
[1:23:02] bible says listen the bible says it's
[1:23:04] going to be a secret catching away two
[1:23:07] will be in the bed one will be caught
[1:23:08] one bit two will be in the field one
[1:23:10] will be gone one will be left two will
[1:23:12] be two be working two will be at the
[1:23:14] office two will be two be wherever and
[1:23:16] one will be gone because it'll be a
[1:23:18] secret but it was the same it's the same
[1:23:21] thing happening today that it happened
[1:23:22] with when noah and noah's day
[1:23:25] noah noah preaching to a lot of evil
[1:23:28] scientific people
[1:23:30] in the most
[1:23:32] the evils thing about
[1:23:34] all that understanding that they had and
[1:23:36] now we're in a day where we got the
[1:23:38] internet we got social media all these
[1:23:40] things it's happening all over again
[1:23:42] ezekiel said uh uh ecclesiastes there's
[1:23:45] nothing new under the sun
[1:23:48] god will do it again in the most evil
[1:23:50] scientific intellectual age god will
[1:23:52] send a message that cannot be proven by
[1:23:55] their intellect
[1:23:56] a paradox
[1:23:58] a paradox that cannot be proven by
[1:24:01] scientist this by scientific knowledge
[1:24:04] and his message is still the same to get
[1:24:06] in the ark brother and preached a
[1:24:08] message to get into the art because he
[1:24:10] knew
[1:24:11] that there was going to be somebody to
[1:24:12] get in
[1:24:15] you think about how hard it was for noah
[1:24:17] to get people on the ark
[1:24:19] he preached and he preached and he
[1:24:20] preached for 100 years and it was it was
[1:24:23] far easier to get the animals on the ark
[1:24:25] because the spirit of god could just
[1:24:26] move over those animals and here they
[1:24:28] come
[1:24:28] one day god noah would look out there
[1:24:30] and see all those animals coming two by
[1:24:32] two and seven by seven for the the clean
[1:24:34] animals and all they were coming and
[1:24:36] coming and coming
[1:24:38] i wonder if you wondered why are all why
[1:24:40] are all the animals coming but yet i
[1:24:42] preached and i've preached my heart out
[1:24:44] for a hundred years and only eight
[1:24:46] people are on this ark he wanted to see
[1:24:48] that ark field i wonder maybe if he
[1:24:50] built it so be because he wanted to get
[1:24:52] it full but yet nobody responded it's
[1:24:55] going to be so you listen you wait till
[1:24:57] the end of this message brother brown
[1:24:58] nails it down how few because he's
[1:25:01] looking he's looking for that life
[1:25:03] where is the life of christ
[1:25:06] where is the life as it was in the days
[1:25:08] of noah
[1:25:10] to think
[1:25:12] if they wanted to get on the ark they
[1:25:14] had to come by noah's message
[1:25:17] the only way the only way to get in that
[1:25:19] door
[1:25:20] was to believe what that man preached
[1:25:23] that was the only way to get in that art
[1:25:24] was to believe what that man preached
[1:25:27] and if they would just step into that
[1:25:28] ark
[1:25:30] they would step into another world
[1:25:32] it'd take a long time to get there but
[1:25:34] eventually one a year later the the door
[1:25:37] would open and they step out into a
[1:25:38] world with no no no sin and no uh
[1:25:43] i'm following my type now i know noah
[1:25:45] got drunk and that kind of stuff but
[1:25:47] no all that scientific stuff got got was
[1:25:50] destroyed the earth was cleaned off and
[1:25:52] and god was starting all brand new
[1:25:55] brother brown said we find that in the
[1:25:56] days of noah that while he preached they
[1:25:58] could hardly believe such a thing as
[1:25:59] that noah believing
[1:26:01] no one was believing for such a thing
[1:26:03] but finally the paradox came
[1:26:05] and it happened
[1:26:07] it actually rained
[1:26:12] the word came to pass then
[1:26:15] and it's still coming to pass today
[1:26:18] he said let me go with the word not with
[1:26:20] some educational program or something
[1:26:22] somebody has cooked up somewhere i know
[1:26:24] god's word will never fail
[1:26:27] the word you see is everything you need
[1:26:30] the word is everything you need
[1:26:35] you know in acts chapter 3 it says that
[1:26:38] peter was talking at the gate beautiful
[1:26:39] when he when he when when he spoke the
[1:26:41] words over that man that was that was
[1:26:43] lame and he spoke to him and he said and
[1:26:45] he began to preach as they they began to
[1:26:47] question out there after he rose to from
[1:26:48] his feet and he said he shall send jesus
[1:26:50] christ
[1:26:51] which was which before was preached unto
[1:26:53] you who the heaven must receive until
[1:26:55] the times of restitution of all things
[1:26:57] the times of restitution of all things
[1:26:59] and now
[1:27:00] now we're at at that time of restitution
[1:27:03] of all things the time of restoration of
[1:27:05] the word
[1:27:07] you see all
[1:27:08] the why the word is so important but the
[1:27:11] word is the word is everything that you
[1:27:14] need if if one word off that eve
[1:27:16] believed one word off back then and it
[1:27:18] caused them to lose everything what
[1:27:20] would the recitation restoration of the
[1:27:22] word the restitution of all things do it
[1:27:25] would restore back everything that eve
[1:27:27] lost it would restore everything back
[1:27:31] so now the word is the thing that's
[1:27:32] changing us
[1:27:34] it's a paradox now it was a paradox when
[1:27:37] israel stood on one side of the hill and
[1:27:39] goliath on the other side of the hill
[1:27:41] it was a paradox when david
[1:27:43] was anointed he was anointed and and he
[1:27:45] went to to defeat the goliath i'm trying
[1:27:48] to i'm i'm
[1:27:50] trying to kind of skim through some
[1:27:51] things it was a paradox to fight goliath
[1:27:53] with that little sling david david went
[1:27:55] against goliath with the most weakest
[1:27:57] weapon he got to show that if you come
[1:27:59] if you come with your your weakness and
[1:28:01] your frail is in your humility but yet
[1:28:02] trust in god trusting god with put put
[1:28:05] your faith in j-e-s-u-s like david did
[1:28:08] with his little sling that god will do
[1:28:10] the fighting for you because david knew
[1:28:12] that giants had been defeated there
[1:28:14] before he knew that joshua had come
[1:28:16] through that place before and he had
[1:28:18] defeated giants
[1:28:19] so he came with confidence believing
[1:28:21] that if god was able to defeat giants
[1:28:23] then that god was still able to do it
[1:28:26] we can come with that same faith
[1:28:27] believing that if god was able to defeat
[1:28:29] giants back in the days of paul it's
[1:28:32] been done before it's be if it was done
[1:28:34] in the days of irenaeus and martin
[1:28:35] luther then god is still the same
[1:28:37] yesterday today and forever if we'll
[1:28:39] just fall in behind the word it was a
[1:28:41] paradox but why why was they why was
[1:28:44] david able to slay that giant because
[1:28:46] the spirit of the lord was on him
[1:28:48] because he had been anointed with that
[1:28:50] anointing of all that samuel poured over
[1:28:51] him and the spirit of the lord was on
[1:28:53] him and that's the thing that does the
[1:28:55] work that's the thing that's what gave
[1:28:56] samson his power a little scrawny runt
[1:28:59] that was able to lift up the gates of
[1:29:01] the city why because the spirit of the
[1:29:04] lord was on him the spirit of the lord
[1:29:06] is that life
[1:29:08] it was apparent
[1:29:09] it's a paradox to see life and life is
[1:29:12] that paradox
[1:29:13] brother brown said it was a paradox when
[1:29:15] god caused the woman to conceive it was
[1:29:17] a paradox that how god the eternal that
[1:29:19] fills all time and eternity could come
[1:29:22] down and become one little baby crying
[1:29:25] in a manger
[1:29:26] a paradox that god would put his life in
[1:29:29] a little child crying in an angel ain't
[1:29:31] literally crying in a manger
[1:29:33] and it's a paradox now what are we
[1:29:35] talking about we're talking about life
[1:29:37] life
[1:29:38] is a paradox
[1:29:40] brother brahm actually said that in his
[1:29:41] sermon he says we're talking about life
[1:29:44] and he said the virgin birth seems
[1:29:46] almost easier to believe than the
[1:29:47] natural birth who determines what it's
[1:29:49] going to be and he talks about a germ
[1:29:51] trying to find his way to the egg and
[1:29:53] you think it would go from point a to
[1:29:55] point b the shortest distance
[1:29:57] but yet he said something
[1:29:59] unknown to science determines it
[1:30:02] determines which egg which sperm which
[1:30:05] germ is going to meet match up
[1:30:07] something that science can't explain why
[1:30:09] is it the one in the back and not the
[1:30:11] one in the front
[1:30:12] something moves it
[1:30:14] something unknown to science determines
[1:30:16] that that ain't a paradox what is
[1:30:18] point to point is the closest way around
[1:30:20] we understand but not that time
[1:30:23] god determines it
[1:30:25] you you think about how god actually
[1:30:27] brother brown said he bred this one to
[1:30:28] this one this one to this one because
[1:30:30] he's
[1:30:31] it's god bringing something into being
[1:30:34] god knew that one day you would be here
[1:30:36] and he's the one that did it his life
[1:30:39] his life is moved everything that's the
[1:30:42] paradox he said it was a paradox it was
[1:30:45] a paradox when he died at the cross why
[1:30:47] would that be a paradox because he was
[1:30:49] alive and yet he gave his life for you
[1:30:52] so that you could have his life
[1:30:55] it was a paradox when he died on the
[1:30:57] cross and it was a paradox when he gave
[1:30:59] that life on the day of pentecost
[1:31:02] the bible said that he and john acts 4
[1:31:04] was ignorant and unlearned
[1:31:06] a paradox that he would give the holy
[1:31:08] ghost to a bunch of unlearned people
[1:31:10] that didn't know nothing about nothing
[1:31:12] they couldn't even write their own names
[1:31:14] that's a paradox you see so many people
[1:31:17] think that you've got to know you've got
[1:31:18] to know all the hebrew john wesley even
[1:31:20] said if if you don't know hebrew and
[1:31:22] greek then you shouldn't be preaching
[1:31:24] and people get that in their minds that
[1:31:25] if you don't know all sorts of
[1:31:27] intellectual things and you can't know
[1:31:29] god but if you can if you die to your
[1:31:31] own abilities and die to your own
[1:31:33] understanding then that life will spring
[1:31:36] up within you it doesn't matter how much
[1:31:38] you know within your own mind is how
[1:31:40] much you know of christ
[1:31:44] it was a paradox how then people up in
[1:31:46] that upper room there afraid of the jews
[1:31:48] and had walked with jesus but when the
[1:31:49] holy ghost came they wasn't afraid no
[1:31:51] more and what made the difference was
[1:31:53] the life
[1:31:55] the life is what made the difference the
[1:31:57] life is what made the difference with
[1:31:59] david with samson with joshua that's
[1:32:02] what made the difference and you you see
[1:32:04] when you got that life you can't
[1:32:07] separate the man
[1:32:08] from the life
[1:32:10] brother brown said now listen to this
[1:32:11] y'all
[1:32:12] brother and said in 1963 he said the
[1:32:14] real believer
[1:32:16] no matter what they are thoroughly
[1:32:18] satisfied
[1:32:19] they are thoroughly convinced
[1:32:21] because the life that's in them has
[1:32:24] already become christ
[1:32:27] it is christ
[1:32:28] it's no more you but christ that lives
[1:32:31] in you
[1:32:33] when you've got the new when you've got
[1:32:35] that life you can't separate that life
[1:32:38] from you anymore because now it's yours
[1:32:42] it's in you it's part of you and you
[1:32:44] can't tear it apart it's you
[1:32:47] christ is in you
[1:32:49] that's the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:51] christ in you the mystery is christ is
[1:32:54] living in you and it's something in you
[1:32:56] that can't be separated you are christ
[1:32:59] and christ is you
[1:33:01] you're both wound up together a
[1:33:03] masterpiece family
[1:33:05] just joined vulcanized so much together
[1:33:07] that you you can't tell one from the
[1:33:09] other that's why paul said in galatians
[1:33:12] 2 20 i'm crucified with christ christ
[1:33:14] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[1:33:17] liveth in me and the life
[1:33:19] which i now live in the flesh
[1:33:21] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:33:24] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:33:27] christ is your life and that's that
[1:33:29] thing that's changing you that's the
[1:33:31] paradox that's past all scientific
[1:33:34] understanding past finding out that
[1:33:36] christ is living in you colossians 1 27
[1:33:39] this is my favorite scripture in the
[1:33:41] bible to whom god will make known what
[1:33:43] is the riches of the glory of this
[1:33:45] mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:33:46] christ in you
[1:33:48] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:33:51] so nothing if you've got that life
[1:33:54] nothing can separate you from that life
[1:33:57] paul said who shall separate us from the
[1:33:59] love of christ shall tribulation or
[1:34:00] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:34:03] nakedness or peril or sword can a sword
[1:34:06] separate you from that life once that
[1:34:08] life is given to you it's it's part of
[1:34:11] you you're the same
[1:34:13] nothing is going to separate you from
[1:34:16] that amen can death separate you from it
[1:34:21] nothing is going to separate it and he
[1:34:23] said we take life so commonly he said we
[1:34:25] pentecostals we're taking god too
[1:34:27] commonly the whole thing
[1:34:29] we just let it pass by what life
[1:34:34] that life is still present in the church
[1:34:37] he said that pillar of fire is still
[1:34:39] alive today among us after all these
[1:34:41] thousands of years and still it's here
[1:34:44] it's a paradox now you might not be able
[1:34:46] to see it this afternoon but the pillar
[1:34:48] of fire is still here how do i know
[1:34:51] because where the word is
[1:34:53] the life of god is present that's right
[1:34:56] the word the word is even how elijah
[1:34:58] knew when he told elisha he or he told
[1:35:00] his servant gehazi he told him that the
[1:35:03] chariot that there's more with us than
[1:35:05] within with them and he knew that
[1:35:07] because he was looking to the word he
[1:35:10] knew that the bible said the word said
[1:35:12] that the angels of god are encamped
[1:35:14] about those that fear him and he was
[1:35:16] looking to the word that's how we know
[1:35:18] that god is with us because his word
[1:35:21] says so
[1:35:22] amen
[1:35:24] brother braham said even the seed in the
[1:35:25] ground is a paradox and he talked about
[1:35:27] how that it comes up and he said there's
[1:35:29] nothing scientifically there and show us
[1:35:30] there but just let the sun rock around
[1:35:33] in its right position watch what happens
[1:35:35] it comes from somewhere that's a paradox
[1:35:37] what's the paradox of a seed that
[1:35:39] there's life in that seed and the life
[1:35:42] in that seed is a paradox
[1:35:44] so that's what we want to see
[1:35:47] we want to see the life
[1:35:51] in ezekiel 9 4 says the lord said unto
[1:35:53] him go through the midst of the city
[1:35:55] through the midst of jerusalem and set a
[1:35:57] mark upon the foreheads of the men
[1:35:59] that sigh and that cry for all the
[1:36:01] denominations for all the abominations
[1:36:03] that be done in the midst thereof
[1:36:06] for all the abominations somebody in
[1:36:08] other words find me somebody that's got
[1:36:11] that kind of a life you know
[1:36:13] the brother of them said i want you
[1:36:15] ministers but if you go back and listen
[1:36:17] to that sermon the paradox that brother
[1:36:18] and priest in 1964 where he really laid
[1:36:21] it listen to how he laid it out so scald
[1:36:22] scalding he said he's looking for the
[1:36:24] life now
[1:36:26] he said i want you ministers
[1:36:28] to lay your hands upon that member of
[1:36:30] your church
[1:36:31] you pentecostal members in other words
[1:36:32] go find somebody
[1:36:34] he's given them a challenge go find
[1:36:36] somebody in your congregation that's got
[1:36:38] that kind of life
[1:36:39] he said then when you find this you come
[1:36:42] and i'll apologize to you
[1:36:44] he said you find that member of yours
[1:36:46] that can't rest day and night for crying
[1:36:48] for the abomination of sins done in the
[1:36:50] city 90 of them stay home and say we
[1:36:53] love susie instead
[1:36:56] he said oh you speak with tongues sure
[1:36:57] jump up and down and shout that's all
[1:36:59] right nothing against that nothing
[1:37:01] against your organization either but i'm
[1:37:03] trying to talk about life
[1:37:05] where's it at
[1:37:07] where's the real christian life
[1:37:10] where's somebody that really cares about
[1:37:12] what's preached over the pulpit somebody
[1:37:14] that really wants to be a christian
[1:37:16] somebody that's concerned about sin in
[1:37:18] the church
[1:37:19] somebody that when they see people
[1:37:20] living in fornication and adultery that
[1:37:22] ain't that should not be
[1:37:24] that's that's not right
[1:37:26] somebody that's concerned about the way
[1:37:28] that you dress and the way that you live
[1:37:31] he said now you showed me that member
[1:37:33] look how worldly he's talking about the
[1:37:36] churches look how worldly how
[1:37:38] indifferent always the outside expresses
[1:37:41] what's on the inside
[1:37:42] by their fruits they're known where is
[1:37:44] it at
[1:37:45] i just ask just answer your question
[1:37:47] before you condemn see just ask that
[1:37:49] question where is that life at where is
[1:37:52] the life of christ at that's what god
[1:37:55] wants to see that's what that's what the
[1:37:56] angel there and ezekiel looking for to
[1:37:59] seal to mark them in the forehead that
[1:38:01] sigh and cry for the abomination of the
[1:38:03] city the ones that have that life
[1:38:06] now you see you see why he's stressing
[1:38:08] this so much all the pentecost the
[1:38:09] denominations and things they said they
[1:38:11] had the truth many many people in the
[1:38:14] message like brother aaron was bringing
[1:38:15] out this morning many people in the
[1:38:16] message proclaim they have the truth and
[1:38:18] they say we've got the truth but where's
[1:38:20] the life at where's the life that when
[1:38:23] you go home and
[1:38:24] are you arguing with your family
[1:38:26] constantly is there peace in your home
[1:38:28] do your kids know that you have that
[1:38:30] same life are you a testimony to the
[1:38:32] people that you go out in your workplace
[1:38:34] with is that life on display because
[1:38:37] that's what the angel is looking for to
[1:38:39] go seal up that's what christ is looking
[1:38:41] for the life the life is what is
[1:38:44] changing you the life is what is
[1:38:47] bringing up that seed the life is what
[1:38:49] will bring you up again if you go down
[1:38:52] into the grave and the life is what will
[1:38:54] change your body
[1:38:58] the life
[1:39:02] brother ram said in the sermon he said
[1:39:04] oh god
[1:39:06] well let me read this quote first he
[1:39:08] said an expectation she said clergyman
[1:39:10] could you mark out on your hands 10
[1:39:11] people a night
[1:39:13] in this city the sign and crying day and
[1:39:15] night
[1:39:16] for the wickedness and things that's
[1:39:18] done in the city
[1:39:19] does anybody in this audience
[1:39:22] know where you could put your fingers on
[1:39:24] five people
[1:39:25] that my what a challenge
[1:39:28] on five people
[1:39:30] that sigh and cry day and night for the
[1:39:32] sins and things of the city
[1:39:35] you see why brother brown put as
[1:39:37] a comparison as it was in the days of
[1:39:39] noah yeah asos were saved but he pointed
[1:39:42] to the rapture like enoch enoch was the
[1:39:44] type of the rapture one
[1:39:47] one and god he's saying he's saying can
[1:39:49] you look in your church and find five
[1:39:52] that are signing and crying for the
[1:39:54] abominations done in the city
[1:39:56] see we come to church and we've almost
[1:39:58] made it like a like a ritual we come to
[1:40:00] church and and and yet we go home and
[1:40:02] sin is still living effective in our
[1:40:05] life we we ignore the things that the
[1:40:07] brother branham said about how you ain't
[1:40:09] supposed to be living with somebody that
[1:40:11] you're married to
[1:40:12] you i i thought i thought we were
[1:40:14] supposed to be holding a standard like
[1:40:16] when ananias and sapphira came into the
[1:40:19] church that same kind of a standard
[1:40:21] where you ain't supposed to be doing
[1:40:22] things that the bible says are not right
[1:40:24] you're supposed to be manifesting the
[1:40:26] life you don't even have a right to take
[1:40:29] communion if you're not living that life
[1:40:31] that other people can look at and see
[1:40:33] the life of christ is living in me you
[1:40:35] come in church and sit and sit among the
[1:40:37] congregation of the people of god but
[1:40:38] yet the life is god wants to see the
[1:40:41] life on display
[1:40:42] he wants to see the light the life in
[1:40:45] you having an effect on your life
[1:40:47] and brother and said oh god but i look
[1:40:49] down through it and think what's the use
[1:40:51] of even trying
[1:40:53] that's a prophet of god looking out at
[1:40:56] the effect that is like like noah you
[1:40:58] think noah ever thought that preaching
[1:41:00] there at the door of the ark and
[1:41:01] preached and preached for a hundred
[1:41:03] years and nobody came but his family
[1:41:06] nobody came all the animals lined up all
[1:41:08] the animals came
[1:41:10] but nobody came but his family and
[1:41:12] brother said what's the use of even
[1:41:13] trying
[1:41:15] he said but then i looked down through
[1:41:17] there
[1:41:18] and see a little light here and there
[1:41:20] a consecrated christian
[1:41:23] praying
[1:41:24] is your life consecrated this afternoon
[1:41:26] are you consecrated that when you get
[1:41:28] along with you want to get along with
[1:41:29] god because you're signing and crying
[1:41:32] for the abomination done in the cd
[1:41:34] there's something in you that's crawling
[1:41:36] and crying out that you want to see god
[1:41:38] manifested in your life that it's worth
[1:41:41] it's worth more to you than just knowing
[1:41:43] about things but you want to know god
[1:41:46] you want christ in your life that you're
[1:41:48] willing to die out to all the things
[1:41:51] that you hold so dear that's why brother
[1:41:53] man said that seed's got to die
[1:41:56] for life to come forth the seed's got to
[1:41:59] die
[1:42:00] jesus what did he say the first thing he
[1:42:02] said except a corn of wheat falls into
[1:42:04] the ground dies it abides alone he
[1:42:06] showed them how to see him die to
[1:42:08] yourself die to your ethics your creeds
[1:42:12] and all this and when you die
[1:42:15] and the life comes in
[1:42:17] you can't hold that life down anymore
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:21] when the resurrection power of jesus
[1:42:23] christ comes into the believer's heart
[1:42:25] you can't keep that down
[1:42:27] you might bury it in the ground
[1:42:29] but one morning it's coming up again
[1:42:32] you can't keep it down because the life
[1:42:34] will have an effect
[1:42:36] it will do something in your body
[1:42:39] brother brown i had that conversation
[1:42:40] with the enfielder there that at the
[1:42:42] apple tree my my wife and i it's it's
[1:42:45] actually down the road to where my
[1:42:46] wife's brother lives up there in
[1:42:47] kentucky and we went to the house and
[1:42:50] talked to the people that lived there
[1:42:51] now and stood at the stump of the apple
[1:42:54] tree that grew there where brother
[1:42:55] branham had this conversation
[1:42:57] talk about a little humble place in the
[1:42:59] middle of kentucky that you wouldn't now
[1:43:01] now it's
[1:43:02] going down in the history of message
[1:43:04] believers that little humble place where
[1:43:06] brother ram talked to the infidel and
[1:43:08] told him about the intelligence that
[1:43:10] makes that sap go down in the tree and
[1:43:13] come up in the spring that it's he said
[1:43:15] you could put a bucket up on the fence
[1:43:17] but why don't the bucket why don't the
[1:43:18] water go down in the ground if you put
[1:43:21] it in a bucket because and the man said
[1:43:24] oh no it don't have any life
[1:43:27] life is the thing that makes the
[1:43:29] difference and brother brandon said i
[1:43:32] said there you are
[1:43:34] now you got it
[1:43:36] life is the thing that matters life is
[1:43:38] what will make it come up he sees he
[1:43:40] said see is life i said see that's god
[1:43:45] god is the life
[1:43:47] the life god is that intelligence that's
[1:43:50] past all scientific understanding that
[1:43:52] makes the sap go down in the roots in
[1:43:54] the winter and makes it come up again in
[1:43:56] the spring and that man died that
[1:43:59] brother brown was talking to after he
[1:44:00] had received that life and brother bam
[1:44:02] came back a year later and his wife was
[1:44:05] bawling him out for coming up and and
[1:44:06] brother and started talking to her and
[1:44:08] he said i'm the one that led your
[1:44:10] husband your your husband to to the lord
[1:44:12] and and she said forgive me
[1:44:14] forgive me she said he died listen to
[1:44:16] how he died
[1:44:18] he died shouting
[1:44:21] both hands up in the air
[1:44:23] praising god knowing
[1:44:26] as that leaf come back as the leaf of
[1:44:28] that apple tree has that leaf come back
[1:44:31] he'd come back again see a paradox
[1:44:35] unexplainable
[1:44:37] the same life that caused that apple
[1:44:39] tree
[1:44:40] apple tree life to come back in the
[1:44:42] spring as the same life that gave him
[1:44:45] confidence at his death to know that one
[1:44:48] day he was coming back up again
[1:44:51] amen
[1:44:52] and brother brahm said there's many big
[1:44:54] paradox we could talk about but let's
[1:44:55] think of this he said there's one great
[1:44:58] one great paradox coming the rapture
[1:45:01] he said let's all be ready for that one
[1:45:03] how do you think we get ready for the
[1:45:04] rapture to make sure that that life is
[1:45:07] in you
[1:45:08] to double check that you're you're
[1:45:10] actually matching the word that what the
[1:45:13] bible says that that life matches what
[1:45:15] the bible the life in you matches what
[1:45:17] the bible says you should be
[1:45:20] a christian walking according to the
[1:45:22] word
[1:45:23] let's say let's not be like the children
[1:45:25] of israel walking through the wilderness
[1:45:27] wondering if we're living in a miracle
[1:45:29] wondering if god still loves us but
[1:45:31] recognize that god is working a miracle
[1:45:34] in your life even now
[1:45:36] he said you know you know what the life
[1:45:38] is
[1:45:39] it's the holy spirit as the music
[1:45:41] musicians come
[1:45:43] he said if you haven't received that
[1:45:44] holy spirit which is life
[1:45:46] that was in the first plant that raised
[1:45:48] up see christ first fruit of those that
[1:45:50] slept
[1:45:51] now if that life that was in him that
[1:45:53] spirit same spirit is not in you
[1:45:56] no matter how nice you try to be
[1:45:59] you can't come forth
[1:46:01] there's nothing there
[1:46:02] to raise you up
[1:46:05] but if that life is in you
[1:46:07] it's going to come forth
[1:46:10] it's a miracle when god brings life
[1:46:13] it's a miracle when god gave you the new
[1:46:15] birth and brought life into your soul
[1:46:19] it's a miracle
[1:46:21] the miracle is his life
[1:46:23] let's stand to our feet and just worship
[1:46:25] him
[1:46:27] if his life is here if his life is here
[1:46:29] moving through the building what do we
[1:46:30] got to worry about
[1:46:32] what do we got to be to be afraid of
[1:46:34] there's nothing can separate us from the
[1:46:36] love of god
[1:46:37] if his if his life if christ is in us
[1:46:40] there's nothing that can tear us apart
[1:46:42] from him not death not the sword not
[1:46:44] famine not plagues not heartache nothing
[1:46:47] can separate it from him because his
[1:46:49] life is in us his life is the thing that
