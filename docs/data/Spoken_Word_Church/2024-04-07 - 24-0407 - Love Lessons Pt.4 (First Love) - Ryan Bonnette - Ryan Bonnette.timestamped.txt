[0:27] here at preliminary as I flew my middle
[0:29] two girls yesterday down to lawrencville
[0:31] the airport there only one that I know
[0:34] of around that's got a restaurant right
[0:36] there at the airport you can literally
[0:38] taxi your plane right up to the
[0:39] restaurant go in there to eat we went in
[0:41] there and everything was fine we flew
[0:43] back flew up to 3500 ft altitude kind of
[0:46] has an effect on people in different
[0:48] ways I never seen this happen but Landon
[0:50] Ula was complaining of terrible ear
[0:52] painy and and the ear a you know didn't
[0:54] have it before went home and and Gabby
[0:57] checked with a little scope thing
[0:58] whatever you call that the doctor stick
[1:00] in your ear you know and she said there
[1:01] a little blister like a blood blister or
[1:03] something they prayer call on they hand
[1:05] his arm put her to bed you know got the
[1:08] thr and you perfectly fine Gabby check
[1:10] and there was no time ever what
[1:12] in thank Lord for that I call him just
[1:16] scone so a little testimony about IA and
[1:19] don't know she stayed in the hospital
[1:20] four days let's go along brother Bob's
[1:23] less than my Sunday about that third day
[1:25] cuz I just want to say that on the third
[1:27] day is when she started responding to
[1:28] that medicine the third day like you
[1:30] told about when she coming around doctor
[1:32] came in the
[1:34] BR rening from ear to air saying the
[1:37] medicine's working doing it thing and
[1:39] she can go home tomorrow so on the
[1:40] fourth day that's significant to you
[1:43] remember my original testimony about IA
[1:45] when she was born and nearly died at 3
[1:46] days old that on that fourth day is when
[1:49] she started coming around no different
[1:51] medicine that time no different
[1:52] treatment at all that we know of is the
[1:54] Bo tou her and she started raise up on
[1:56] Resurrection Sunday and started to cut
[1:58] around and but uh she's had many
[2:01] hospital stays this was her fourth one
[2:03] that I can recall having to stay in the
[2:04] hospital for multiple days and she knows
[2:07] when the nurse or doctor comes in the
[2:09] room she was set as you know I'm going P
[2:11] no she going to be stuck you going to be
[2:12] pted and poked and taking the MRIs and
[2:15] xrays and EKGs and giving all kind of
[2:18] medicine she don't want to take and all
[2:20] this things so she get she cring it when
[2:22] a doctor nurse comes in she she gets on
[2:26] on and very out of character I was there
[2:28] visiting I was still working taking care
[2:30] of kids elsewhere but visiting every
[2:32] night G being I was there in the
[2:34] hospital Atlanta and I was just sitting
[2:36] there looking her she's still out of
[2:37] character the do the nurse giv a little
[2:38] like a tourniquet I think little rubber
[2:40] band thing she's sitting there just
[2:41] slapping her legs with and it's not
[2:43] happy at all just like she just remind
[2:45] me Jus body in that quarter roaches in
[2:47] the tle fixing chase out the money
[2:48] changer going to attack a nurse of this
[2:51] things hates being there and one day she
[2:54] set up in the bed and she wented over at
[2:56] Mom and she says uh when one of the
[2:59] nurses came in that didn't do any of
[3:01] that stuff that didn't poker just came
[3:02] in to talk she said I like the nurses
[3:05] that just come in just to
[3:07] talk so she hates all that stuff but by
[3:10] God's grace she'd have to come home and
[3:12] have F Well couple nights ago she wanted
[3:15] to give her tic
[3:17] Bo
[3:19] [Applause]
[3:21] so see the only kid that hadn't done
[3:24] that that hadn't been baptized yet and
[3:26] hadn't got saved and so we've been kind
[3:28] of talking to her along the way just
[3:29] waiting for the Lord to deal with her
[3:31] and the other night she said I want to
[3:32] be baptized and said do you understand
[3:33] what it means and so we started talking
[3:35] and prayed the CER prayer with her later
[3:37] to the
[3:40] Lord sit get baptized but that heart
[3:43] monitor I can't it's not supposed to be
[3:46] submerged in water so we got to wait you
[3:48] know y little bit
[3:53] longer so another little uh preliminary
[3:55] not this is more pertaining to my lesson
[3:57] and um just an encouragement that to
[4:00] everybody just admonishing everybody
[4:01] just to remind everybody to do
[4:04] this
[4:07] um I left a lot out that little
[4:09] testimony too about again there's the
[4:10] numbers and there's the names of the
[4:12] nurses and all that you know always look
[4:13] at those things that we had another
[4:15] Caitlyn which if you don't know the name
[4:17] Kate different forms of that name that
[4:19] we had in the first time at that the
[4:21] Kate the name Kate means pure I believe
[4:24] God works through doctors and nurses
[4:26] whether they believe or not I believe
[4:28] God and angels work through them yeah we
[4:30] purify amen purify people because
[4:32] they're dealing with mankind God's most
[4:34] precious creation and and helping people
[4:36] and trying to help people and so God
[4:39] works for them to purify and cleanse
[4:40] from disease and here we had our first
[4:42] nurse and there was Caitlyn once again
[4:44] that our first nurse practitioner
[4:47] what um anyway I'll leave out a lot of
[4:51] other details just I'm going to go on
[4:53] this little other preliminary this more
[4:55] TI into my lesson uh as brother white is
[4:58] our new pastor now I want to uh remind
[5:00] everybody to encourage him it's the
[5:02] hardest role of anybody on Earth that I
[5:05] know of even greater than the position
[5:07] of President of the United States
[5:09] nothing higher of a calling than to be a
[5:11] pastor in the Church of upon the Bride
[5:13] of Jesus
[5:14] Christen and so we need to stand behind
[5:16] him and sister June back them with all
[5:19] of our prayers yes all the time as you
[5:21] know gab and I constantly listening to
[5:22] the seals brother Del preach in 82 and
[5:24] 83 and over all the many years we've
[5:26] heard him say Lord bless our wife Yonder
[5:28] he's always saying bless our wife I
[5:29] thinking Brother D that's that's your
[5:31] wife my brother you know that's our wife
[5:34] and the Lord's always been attacking her
[5:36] and her body with sat oh because she is
[5:37] serving the lord because devil knows
[5:40] that's a weakness for a man we we want
[5:42] our wives and kids to be well and we
[5:43] hate to see them down and devil just
[5:45] makes a playground out of them I know
[5:47] sister Jan L been red with sickness and
[5:50] pain in her body just beyond what I can
[5:51] imagine but we hold them up in prayer
[5:54] and all the weight hold him up in prayer
[5:56] and encouragement and anything you can
[5:57] do brother bram's message on I am the
[6:01] resurrection and the life said now you
[6:03] got to have confidence in the house and
[6:05] judgment House of God where God comes
[6:06] down passes his judgment your pastor
[6:09] you're supposed to be a righteous man
[6:10] the congregation is supposed to be with
[6:12] him 100% you're supposed to be just the
[6:15] 100% together and in there if you're not
[6:18] they just got a way to get him you got a
[6:21] lul have everything cleared out in
[6:24] Christ my God reveal to love one another
[6:26] that's TI in my love lesson love one
[6:28] another above everything love one
[6:30] another don't matter what the devil
[6:32] tries to say you're all in one great big
[6:34] sweet group now remember all warnings he
[6:36] say mo let that stay that way he'll
[6:38] shoot everything he's got to bring
[6:40] somebody to make this Target and bring
[6:41] some credit for unbel in and sit him
[6:43] down cause him Fellowship to go under
[6:44] the quietness and things and then I'll
[6:46] shoot that guy with some kind of P how
[6:47] you go skipping on the yellow part and
[6:51] stay with your pastor he's the shepherd
[6:53] and he and you give him respects he'll
[6:55] lead you through because he's ordained
[6:57] God to do so man you remember that yeah
[6:59] anyy come in what it does to cling that
[7:01] much closer together and then run that
[7:05] the devil's using and enemy we get out
[7:07] would come in and be one of you I call
[7:09] this Galatians 66 man to man my dad in
[7:12] the Baptist Church he used to write
[7:14] emails to the uh pastor and I I took
[7:17] notice of that and I thought that's a
[7:19] good thing to do and he try to encourage
[7:20] the pastor and say I like what you said
[7:22] here and here and here so over many
[7:24] years now our ministers that know that I
[7:26] write them letters or emails or I meant
[7:28] to them in the parking lot always always
[7:29] tried to because when I teach Sunday
[7:30] school people just stare at me I don't
[7:32] know if you're getting in saying or not
[7:35] I like a little word of encouragement
[7:36] you know come to me and get tell me what
[7:37] you got out of it you know and I thought
[7:39] how much more would the man of God
[7:41] standing here as a pastor actual
[7:42] preacher want to be encouraged and know
[7:45] that somebody getting what he's saying
[7:47] so that's why I write these email to our
[7:49] Minister and I call it 66 because man to
[7:53] man because six is number of man
[7:55] Galatians 66 man to man taught let him
[7:58] that is taught in the word Comm unicate
[7:59] unto him that teacheth in all good
[8:01] things so tell them what you got out of
[8:02] that
[8:03] sermon and encourage him in the Lord you
[8:06] know
[8:09] uh so brother John's been teaching on
[8:12] this financial Jubilee and I don't know
[8:14] if y'all recognize but he's talking
[8:16] about more than just finances he's
[8:17] talking about Jubilee from sin from the
[8:20] Deb of sin Jubilee from vdomus and and
[8:24] fear and torment and anxiety and
[8:27] sickness and uh lust and depression and
[8:30] all kind of things that tie into that
[8:31] lesson of Jubilee and it goes a lot
[8:34] deeper than just finances he ain't
[8:35] talking about just money and likewise my
[8:38] love lessons are more than just about
[8:40] marriage and more than just about a walk
[8:41] with the lord it's about both sides it's
[8:43] about uh there's just layers and layers
[8:45] and layers of this that if you will let
[8:47] it apply it to your life and do the
[8:49] little things I'm talking about simple
[8:51] little things it'll change a marriage I
[8:54] guarantee it will it's affected ours
[8:56] it's affected change in mind gav's
[8:58] marriage for sure
[9:02] so this lesson is is as much about
[9:04] marriage as it is about a relationship
[9:06] with the Lord I've kind of not been
[9:08] transparent until now saying what I
[9:11] really mean because um we're in a
[9:13] 16-year marriage and I'm talking to
[9:14] people who have been married longer and
[9:15] I've been alive so I don't really feel
[9:17] like I have a place to say to any of
[9:19] y'all how to do marriage you know but
[9:21] I'm just saying take it for what it's
[9:22] worth if it'll help you let it help if
[9:24] not you know keep doing what you're
[9:26] doing if what you're doing is working no
[9:28] problem but I want to be clear that
[9:30] aside from teaching about our love
[9:31] relationship Lord I'm teaching about
[9:33] marriage you can't tell sometimes when
[9:35] marriages are struggling but many are
[9:38] this is the remedy Christ Living in you
[9:40] and your spouse in your home in your
[9:43] marriage how by greeing listening and
[9:45] praying together daily to the word of
[9:47] God remove self from Marriage the reason
[9:51] I don't have a crop of corn in my yard
[9:54] is because I have not planted one and
[9:56] the reason maybe you don't have a good
[9:57] marriage is because you have not some to
[9:59] see for this takes discipline the reason
[10:01] you don't have a close walk with the
[10:02] Lord maybe you haven't done the right
[10:04] things that you haven't sewn the seeds
[10:05] for yeah gav and I both spend much time
[10:10] together but then separate too listening
[10:11] to the sermons that are preached here
[10:13] from our ministers I go back course we
[10:15] listen to him over and over again as I
[10:16] drive the truck at night during the day
[10:18] and and then Gabby stays up till about
[10:20] 2: in the morning almost every night she
[10:22] got get up at 5:00 and get kids ready
[10:24] for school but for certain reasons she
[10:26] can't wa okay um I'm going say why that
[10:29] is but she's up and at Night by herself
[10:32] cuz I'm on the road driving a truck
[10:34] she's there by herself listening to
[10:35] these ministers over and over again what
[10:36] we're doing is packing the word of of
[10:38] God down that se we want to pack down
[10:40] press down running over so that God can
[10:43] come and Quicken it because if you don't
[10:44] give anything to work with you can't
[10:45] Quicken the work to you it's not just
[10:47] magic it is something that you have to
[10:49] do on your part right seow the word of
[10:51] God down press it down good crop takes
[10:54] time and effort so does our marriage our
[10:57] walk Lord yes
[11:00] um this is from darta Bible they call it
[11:02] I think it's called Life Bible now that
[11:05] changes the name so G I read from every
[11:07] day and I devotion together and there's
[11:10] one of these little devotions in there
[11:11] put every day and this one was so good
[11:13] it ties in perfect lesson Western
[11:16] culture has shaped our minds to believe
[11:18] that the purpose of the institution of
[11:20] marriage is to make individuals happy
[11:22] people tend to believe that marriage is
[11:24] about finding the right person a person
[11:26] whose likes and dislikes hobbies and
[11:28] interests match our own we tend to
[11:29] believe it's about finding a person who
[11:31] completes us and makes us whole and
[11:33] about rights what we F this results in
[11:37] the me mindset in marriage we can
[11:40] foolishly enter into a marriage
[11:41] relationship focused on what we think we
[11:44] will get out of it in Hebrew in
[11:46] Ephesians 5 the Apostle Paul tells us
[11:48] that marriage isn't about making
[11:49] ourselves happy it's about making us
[11:51] holy marriage is a picture of how Jesus
[11:55] loves the church and gave himself a
[11:58] sacrifice Ephesians 5 marriage isn't
[12:01] about finding the right person it's
[12:03] about being the right person both
[12:05] husband and wife are called to be the
[12:07] type of people who love unconditionally
[12:10] forgive continually and serve
[12:12] sacrificially just like Jesus Paul calls
[12:15] us to enter into marriage with a
[12:17] Ministry mindset marriage isn't about
[12:19] what you can get out of the relationship
[12:21] but about what you can give to the
[12:23] relationship for God's glory when you
[12:25] seek to demonstrate love in your
[12:27] marriage when you are willing to lay
[12:28] down your life for your spouse and serve
[12:31] her sacrificially the gospel is
[12:33] rehearsed daily in your household bottom
[12:36] line marriage is about having the
[12:38] ministry mindset of loving service
[12:41] rather than selfish mindset it's from
[12:44] moment of strength that's a book that
[12:46] from part
[12:51] meate but um this is a quote from a book
[12:54] called strength inspiration for for
[12:57] men so
[13:00] Christ in marriage beyond the wedding
[13:04] day so when people come to the altar
[13:06] they get married and all this there's
[13:07] all this sanctimony ceremony there's
[13:09] there's preacher at the altar in the
[13:11] church with Witnesses in the Bible and
[13:13] all this stuff and then they come down
[13:15] and they say Lord we want you in our
[13:16] marriage and that's kind of in a way of
[13:18] committing their life and dedicating
[13:19] their marriage to God but what really
[13:21] matters is what they do in the go out
[13:23] there after the wedding date that's
[13:26] where Christ comes into marriage if you
[13:27] put him in your marriage you have put it
[13:29] in there there's something you have to
[13:30] do it doesn't just happen because you
[13:32] got married at an altar High preacher
[13:34] like salvation you come to the altar cry
[13:37] pray repent and then go out there what
[13:40] what matters is what happens out there
[13:41] if you read your Bible and pray every
[13:42] day that's what makes Christ in your
[13:44] life coming down the altar to start your
[13:46] marriage here is good it's a good start
[13:49] but beyond the wedding day is what
[13:50] really matters putting Christ in your
[13:52] marriage every seing day walk close with
[13:55] the Lord individually and let your
[13:57] spouse keep it FR is the same goes never
[14:00] lose your first love I'm going to talk
[14:02] in this lesson the title of this lesson
[14:03] is First Love Never Lose Your F your
[14:06] first love for Christ or your spouse the
[14:09] Ohio group and the Honduras group have
[14:11] Pro have provoked us to Godly jealousy
[14:14] by their enthusiasm about the word of
[14:16] God this should stimulate us and cause
[14:18] us to better appreciate the ministry we
[14:20] have be fervent don't take for granted
[14:22] the ministry and message we have
[14:25] remember that we had remov self from
[14:28] Marriage
[14:29] there should not be one mention of
[14:31] divorce or separation and message
[14:33] marriages we should be experts at love I
[14:36] don't claim to be an expert but I study
[14:38] it a lot and that's I meditate on a lot
[14:41] good oldfashioned thinking goes a long
[14:43] way you know God gave us a mind to think
[14:47] we can use it for him use it for the
[14:48] devil if we just meditate on the word of
[14:50] God and meditate and say Lord really
[14:52] what direction we have going life you
[14:53] don't know how much I fasted and prayed
[14:55] and sought God for a wife and how much I
[14:57] just thought about it what would make me
[14:58] a good life and I would just sit down
[15:01] and think well I want somebody Holy
[15:02] Ghost bu I want somebody read the B and
[15:03] pray with me I want somebody come to
[15:04] church with me and just believe the word
[15:06] of God with me and that's where we had
[15:08] the whole time and we read the Bible
[15:10] every day before we got engaged you know
[15:12] together that's important it is so key
[15:16] and yet we had troubles okay early on in
[15:19] our marriage not talking divorce but
[15:21] Gabby a time or two wanted to leave me
[15:22] for my bad attitude in Jordan Kentucky
[15:24] take a break for a little while and get
[15:25] away from for a little while and said
[15:26] than we got to do something to the
[15:28] sunmate right
[15:29] and it was in 2018 oddly enough through
[15:32] death in the family came this Revelation
[15:35] that my mother and all passed away and
[15:36] my father andlaw said to me
[15:38] R Sharon passed away I want you to know
[15:41] this we had the type of relationship
[15:43] that we always looking out for each
[15:44] other we weren't in it for own s he said
[15:47] um he he said I would sneak around
[15:49] behind her back get her a certain a new
[15:51] Fone or something she wanted that she
[15:52] wouldn't bu for herself he said she'd go
[15:55] around behind my back and give me that
[15:56] fishing pole that I wouldn't buy for
[15:58] myself and I thought wow I've been
[16:00] looking that marriage all time and that
[16:02] was an eye opener that simple little
[16:04] Revelation from there spawned all this
[16:06] great big uh Revelation to me that she
[16:08] been unfolding that selflessness is so
[16:11] key in marriage and not thinking of
[16:13] yourself where was there any grounds for
[16:15] argument for problems if all you're
[16:17] thinking about is the other person you
[16:19] know if all you're thinking about is how
[16:21] you can please him please or her please
[16:23] your spouse where's the rounds for
[16:25] argument you you know our kids almost
[16:28] never see any time arguments and it's
[16:30] just well we we fuss at the kids a lot
[16:33] and all that on shouting going on to the
[16:36] kids up between me happy no I just I
[16:39] love her to death and I you know she'll
[16:41] P up my wrongs and I said well you're
[16:42] right you're ex right to quit making so
[16:44] many sweets I'm going to make it all you
[16:46] know sick sugar anyway but 1 Corinthians
[16:51] 7 I would have you and without
[16:53] carefulness he that is unmarried car for
[16:56] the things that belong to the Lord how
[16:58] he made please the Lord but he that is
[17:00] married care for the things that are of
[17:02] the world how may please his wife so if
[17:04] you abstain from marriage in the first
[17:05] place you know you can commen the Lord
[17:07] saying but if you're in a marriage you
[17:09] are supposed to he's not saying anything
[17:10] wrong with a man caring for his wife and
[17:13] trying to please her and do to her he
[17:15] didn't sayth wrong to do that it said
[17:16] it's is going to be a distraction from
[17:17] the Lord but if you better the marry
[17:19] than div Bine you know he said that in
[17:20] another place same thing there's differ
[17:23] between a wife and a virgin the
[17:24] unmarried woman care for the things that
[17:26] the Lord has name be holy both in body
[17:28] and spirit but that is married car say
[17:30] of the world how do she make please your
[17:32] husband nothing wrong with it he didn't
[17:34] say anything wrong it's just going to be
[17:35] a distraction from the Lord but you know
[17:36] you keep committing your life to God but
[17:39] try to please your husband and your wife
[17:41] do things for them not for your own self
[17:42] not what marriage is about I speak for
[17:45] your own Prophet not that I may cast a
[17:46] snare upon you for that which is comely
[17:48] that you may tend theart of the Lord
[17:49] without
[17:50] distraction
[17:52] and me read some my notes Here make sure
[17:55] I'm not leaving something
[17:57] out
[17:59] and his
[18:01] hand so God keeps his word brother G
[18:04] says children them back to your God
[18:06] quickly don't tangle with the world for
[18:07] anything stay out of this modern world
[18:10] out of these modern theologies just look
[18:12] at the L of God read your bow and pray
[18:14] all the time he didn't say just read
[18:16] your M and pray there's some places
[18:17] where he did say you go close to Lord
[18:19] read B and pray but there one place
[18:21] where he said do it every day there's
[18:22] one place here where he says all the
[18:24] time don't be worried Rejoice be
[18:27] rejoicing and happy for the Redemption
[18:28] of the church is drawing and die we
[18:30] shall see him who died for us you
[18:33] remember uh brother Bob I'm sorry
[18:35] brother Zach black um brother Brandon
[18:38] talking about at some place he's talking
[18:39] about in one message he talked about
[18:41] drinking more than your portion you know
[18:43] drink and push out and we have to drink
[18:46] enough to sustain our spiritual life
[18:48] drink enough at the word of God but then
[18:50] drink more than enough to let us bear
[18:52] fruit and drink more than enough to let
[18:54] it you know be a blessing to others
[18:55] around us so just keep drinking and
[18:56] drinking drinking and you know
[18:59] say like brother Zack Black's dream
[19:01] after getting born again getting the new
[19:03] first the come very and testified of a
[19:04] dream that he had where he was eating he
[19:06] end up down he was not getting full and
[19:07] he kept eating he still not getting full
[19:10] so he just kept eating and I believe the
[19:11] point of the dream was after get born
[19:13] again you're baby in Christ you need to
[19:15] eat well really when you're when ears in
[19:18] in the way of you sering the Lord you
[19:19] still need to eat keep keep eating and
[19:22] pushing out I talk a lot about studying
[19:24] seeking God drinking the word of God but
[19:26] it's is it possible to drink too much
[19:29] if it is let's say we don't fall in that
[19:31] category so let's don't worry about it
[19:33] and most of us I could say we need to
[19:35] clean more or eat more or the word of
[19:37] God don't worry about doing too much I
[19:39] think we're away away from that it's
[19:41] kind of like the fish in the ocean we
[19:42] worried about drinking too much perhaps
[19:44] we might think it best not to study too
[19:46] much we need to drink more than our
[19:48] portion in other words enough to satisfy
[19:52] us and sustain our life to be over
[19:53] flowing and bear fruit to
[19:57] God establish your first love with the
[19:59] Lord and maintain your first love with
[20:01] the
[20:03] Lord so we come here you know everybody
[20:05] likes to teach the doctrine and some
[20:07] people say we came with a little seed in
[20:09] us um and that kind of thing and and I
[20:12] um brother BR said a nonseed there's
[20:14] nothing to Quicken U by our natural
[20:16] birth we born of sin shaking iniquity we
[20:18] came with that nonseed and we came with
[20:20] lots of false ideas and it's is what we
[20:21] came there with and by the new birth we
[20:24] receive the word of God eternal life and
[20:27] we start on this ver First Love
[20:30] um we start on this first love with the
[20:33] Lord if you remember when you first gave
[20:34] out Lord how you were so on fire and how
[20:36] you just loved fell in love Lord I
[20:38] remember back still in the Baptist
[20:40] Church when I first gave my heart Lord
[20:41] and I was listening to worship s like I
[20:43] still did now and felt such a strong
[20:46] love for the Lord and I still do and
[20:48] that will still stay fresh as long as
[20:49] you keep reading the word of God and
[20:51] keep praying never let that die and same
[20:53] thing in your marriage and I fell in
[20:55] love with Gabi I felt this strong
[20:58] affection for her but now it's
[21:00] infinitely stronger than that only
[21:02] because I kept uh stating this room I
[21:05] won't get to it this room of in one of
[21:07] these devotion labing less and I quote
[21:09] this uh staying in the devotional this
[21:12] uh uh appreciation rooms what would you
[21:14] call it the room of appreciation where
[21:16] you don't think about all the bad things
[21:17] of your spouse think about all the good
[21:19] things and think about all the good
[21:21] things of God there is nothing bad about
[21:22] God to think about
[21:27] really um from Gabby and I read also
[21:30] Spurgeon every day on crucifies you know
[21:33] we read a lot of other devotions and up
[21:34] from other people that are not message
[21:36] fol a lot of blessing to be had in that
[21:38] and readings from Brother Charles
[21:40] Spurgeon we have volumes of books of his
[21:41] from my grandma when she passed she left
[21:44] theic books this is from his sermon
[21:46] declension from First Love assment
[21:48] delivered on Sabbath eil September 26
[21:50] 1858 Charles Bon at the new Park Street
[21:54] Chapel he quotes uh Revelation 2
[21:57] nevertheless I was somewhat against
[21:58] because thou has left thy First Love uh
[22:01] he said if we down at the yellow I me
[22:04] just read the whole thing we shall never
[22:06] love Christ much except we live near to
[22:09] him love to Christ is dependent on our
[22:11] nearest to him just like planets in the
[22:13] sun why are some planets cold why did
[22:16] they move so slow at a slow rate simply
[22:18] because they're so far from the sign but
[22:20] the mother planet Mercury is and they
[22:22] should be in a boiling heat and spin
[22:24] around the Sun in Rapid orance so
[22:26] beloved if we live near to Christ we
[22:28] cannot help loving him the heart that is
[22:30] near Jesus must be full of his love but
[22:33] when we live days and weeks and months
[22:35] without personal prayer without real
[22:36] Fellowship how can we maintain love
[22:39] toward a stranger he must be a friend
[22:41] and we must stick close to him as he
[22:44] sticks close to us close to than a
[22:45] brother or else we shall never have our
[22:48] first love there's a thousand reasons
[22:51] why I might give but I live I leave each
[22:53] of you to search your heart to find out
[22:56] why thou H has lost each of you your
[22:58] first
[22:59] love really fall in love with the Lord
[23:02] first brother from toov number three um
[23:05] says that's why the way it is with God

[23:08] newspaper 10 some the but fall in love
[23:12] with h get down and really get him in
[23:14] your heart the L of God should brought
[23:16] in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost then go
[23:17] to read the Bible and you'll see it
[23:19] coming right out between the lines so
[23:21] you know what he's saying he he never
[23:24] said that right out in the word Jesus
[23:26] thank the father because he had he had
[23:28] those things eyes are wise and pry no
[23:30] else could read my wife's letters like
[23:31] that because I love her the way that way
[23:34] and that's the way she writes to me say
[23:36] that's the way God writes to you it's
[23:38] between the
[23:39] lines you can have that first love
[23:42] always if you do what I'm talking about
