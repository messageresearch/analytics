being lifted up what josh what are you putting it i'm okay all right we're good last time we had this thing on we weren't good so good to be in the house with the lord good to see you full house as full as it can get and bunch downstairs so thank you all for being here and it's a little warm up here rich can you check see if that fan's on please sir so good to be in the house lord while he's doing that remember uh by way of announcements i remember what brother tara said also brother dale will be preaching went this coming wednesday and then on december the 31st we'll start at eight o'clock watch night service uh you'll be singing getting your songs ready uh testimonies whatever you need to do we'll for those of you that have not come before we started eight saying about 20 minutes let the minister come and preach as long as brother william wants to preach and then we will sing or testify until midnight and then what we're going to do is i don't think we're going to go outside and take communion at one o'clock or 12 o'clock at night we better stay in here and do that so we're going to do it in a safe way like we did before so don't worry about that all right that okay you know they they say they say if they ever died we'd be in trouble they said they always say that what you do on the first day of the year is what you do the rest of the year so we praise god and take communion amen so that we have communion they do all their stuff out there but i also wish richard that you know you you're off usually we're off january the first yeah right so that's not what we're doing all the rest of the year we got to go back to work january the second so right yeah so it's not always true but good to be in the house of the lord remember the holidays people driving back and forth everybody going here and there and everywhere just have a real safe holiday and may the lord bless you if you got your bibles let's go to 1st john uh we'll do this one and i i i think i'm doing next sunday too right yeah okay and then that will probably wind up this one and then i think if if it's all right with you guys i think we may start the first of the year with some of the major doctrines since we're talking about these two spirits and we see there's new ones coming in that that when we say things that we say they you know it's all new to them and um even some of the older ones we like to brush up on our on our knowledge of the word of god and why we believe what why we believe what we believe while we're sitting here today and not sitting somewhere else amen so we may start that january the 3rd we will be doing two services so we'll be back to brother dale myself as far as we know so we'll just do that and but we will be here next this coming wednesday and sunday regular time regular the way we've been first john 4. today we're going to speak on satan exposed because there's got to be a time when we see the we it's okay to see see these two spirits and see how they work but someone has to be exposed to where we can look at that and say aha that's what that is and then you don't go there because i was reading the bible yesterday or day four yesterday it says two cannot walk together unless they agree because somewhere you're gonna rub shoulders or you're gonna grind noses or something if you're not both in like i said before how many truths are they there's only one truth there's not and and you know we go back to the 900 and something different denominations that was in 1964. there's like 13 000 different denominations in the world now different factions different beliefs god is not that confused man has confused this thing to where the paul said by the simplicity of the gospel just read it like what it says and we'll be all right amen but good to have everybody here and we want to thank brother dale again for what he did for us last weekend amen the food and the lodging man that was a beautiful place and thank all of you for taking some wonderful pictures and posting them on facebook that's really pretty there were some really good pictures taken so we thank you for that and we may have our july i mean our february banquet they have the lord's still with us and we're still with we'll still with the world if not then we'll have our valentine's banquet on the other side amen first john 4. see all of our loved ones what a valentine's day first john 4 verse 1 and let's pray before we get started the heavenly father thank you for this day thank you for a time and an opportunity to stand before the true purchased possession that you before the foundation of the world lord you didn't just figure this out you saw this you saw this in a reality in your mind lord and now we've come to the place to where as you said in your word that you were slain before the foundation of the world but there had to come a time when you literally came to this earth and was slain on a cross and lifted up as the sacrifice lord we were as we sing that song we look back in the old testament and we see how the the priest had to lift up they had to give a heave offering they had to lift up lord the ham or whatever it was the shoulder the part of of the sacrifice lord just showing that one day that we were going to have to look up to you father that they were gonna put you your flesh on a cross and you were gonna die for our sins but as that sacrifice could not come back and make the believer perfect lord you came back on the day of pentecost and started making people perfect and completing you father we thank you for that lord let us have a dip of that holy ghost again today lord may the fire fall the tongues of fire like you did on the day of pentecost lord come and give us a rejuvenation lord something to take us through to this new year father we ask that you be with the ones that are sick brother homer longoria lord being in there in the hospital i think with pneumonia all the different ones sister rita montgomery lord and the loss of her husband all the different ones lord we just we got we've got to bind together unto you lord and not let that fear as the two sisters saying lord fear is a liar you have no fear everywhere you went you said fear not because you knew that fear would be there lord now we pray that you take this fear away from us that we're not groping in darkness but we've been shown the true light father give us this day our daily bread in jesus name we pray amen first john 4 believe it beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world that's what i want to do i want you to try this thing not try not try it but try them put them on trial yes right put it on trial because the devil is going to put it on trial he's going to try you to see what you believe and you know what god's going to let him yeah amen because god don't have to prove to satan he's the creator that's right but we have to prove that that creator is in us amen by overcoming the things of the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come now remember that's 2000 years ago in its infancy we are dealing with a full grown man the devil is has got smarter amen even now already is in the world he says year of god little children have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god here's not us pretty simple huh hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated in the lord as blessing a reading of the word in an exposition of the church ages if you want to pull that one up this is one we read all the time we're going to keep reading it because i see a lot of things in there that that that if we take that one quote right there we'll take a body change if we'll see that and understand it christ now remember christ in the true church then it's got to be false christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now look a continuation of the book of acts what was the book of acts the holy ghost fell on 120 they went out ministering they went out telling the world not that there was a trinity of gods not that the water baptism was in the name of the father son holy ghost no no peter was the one that said be baptized in the name of jesus christ through the holy spirit and we believe that jesus christ god and the holy spirit's the same person so they can't contradict each other most of the religions of the day you look at them and you think well god's in he's mad at jesus and jesus and the holy ghost ain't got nothing they can't get it together no they got it together we the ones that don't have it together amen so let's just blame us for that not god but the book of revelation show how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless and this is where i got my thought today it exposes satan all right so it's going to something is going to expose him but remember from the garden of eden until today or until i say 1963 satan was hid he was not hid in the bars and the drunks and he was hid in religion he was hid in religion but somewhere he has to be exposed because we're going to read in second thessalonians here where that man of sin has got to be exposed he's got to be revealed all right or he's got to be made known so that we know when jesus told them after he preached the six seals he said don't go over here if somebody says christ is over here why do you not go over there because he's here you've got a revelation that he's inside of you you don't have to go over there and get it it's already inside of you but that's a revelation though that you've got to get that's why it's a personal experience with god not just some saying some novenas or saying hail mary's or whatever they do you know all those things just just believe and and you know go live any way you want to that's not the way that's not the way i you know i was thinking yesterday we have this and don't get me wrong jesus christ is the savior of the world amen he'll save your soul if you'll ask him but he does not want you to stay a baby do you want your kids to stay babies no you want to grow up right so jesus christ when he comes into your soul he comes in and you are a newborn what paul said babe baby but he does not want you to stay baby because he said desiring the sincere milk of the word he said but you got to take some meat we had some good steak and taters last night but you know what i had a cold glass of milk yesterday morning too but i had state and potatoes you know why cause i'm grown up right hey man you're grown up then today you come and you eat some beans you eat some potatoes something with some meat in it amen because we desire the sincere milk of the word but we desire though that we go on god desires that we go on you say well it's just so easy just to be a baby you know we were playing with little hudson yesterday and that's kind of where i was what i was thinking and you know we did everything for him i mean he can even walk and here's mama got him by the hand no he can walk let him go but all of us were oh wipe his mouth i gotta go change his diaper i got to go feed him we got shh hudson's got to take him out then you the mama dissipated you see what i mean but now they didn't obviously didn't do me that way mama didn't come over and get me by the hand say come on wait let's go we got toys down here to play with you understand what i mean it's okay being a baby but it's not okay to stay a baby amen you got to grow up in god and you got to make that choice that's right i can't make that choice for you know what you've got it's got to be revealed to you that god wants to give you more than you already got amen god will give you more if you ask him but see what what the world does is they they they look at us and they say well well you don't cut your hair women and you don't wear pants and because we do what the bible says find me any other find me the other opposite of it it's not in the bible man has by what misinterpreted theology has told you it was okay to do that but we see it in the word of god but see they look at us like oh poor pitiful women poor pitiful men they don't get to go out and have a beer with the guys and and you know go to ball games and they don't sit and talk about cars and it's okay to do that not the beer part but they don't talk about cars and stuff but that's consumes people we were watching football game last night or yesterday on the screen you know there to um at the cabin we were in or lodge and then people are idiots but they're idiots for their football team i mean you gotta i don't know why i'm doing this go to green bay wisconsin the coldest place in the world well coldest place in the united states and green bay is playing yeah well minnesota is green bay is playing football and it's like 10 below zero you got ever how many letters it takes to spell green bay or packers there's that many idiots with no shirt on with a big old pea right here you see what i mean brother brown said i want to be a fool for christ if we become a fool like that toward the word of god like they put it toward that then we'll be okay amen that's exactly what if you look at the world and you see what they're doing because they look at you and they go oh poor people y'all so depressed and so beat down and you know we're the happiest people in the world hey man we got truth we're going somewhere hey man we got somewhere to go we've had a guide to tell us about it and that guide is now inside of you i mean the holy ghost amen right you can have an anointing but to have the true baptism of the holy ghost will give you this what true church you can't be a true church without having it that's right because he's not going by the church building amen he's talking about church people amen bride it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for then she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true how many times he says true true church true revelation true revelation true truth like i said last time pilate was so confused he said what is truth we've had that answer we've got that answer to that what is truth amen he knows that if he gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her does that that means he's got some kind of power right now and it's permitted power and it's permitted power that you give him right and i give him amen like brother gary atkins always said he said you know he said that first horse rider was a uh had a white horse and it was a man sitting on the horse with a bow and no arrows so how's he gonna shoot you he's a bluff but what we do every morning we get up and we get about 20 of 20 arrows and we hand them to him so here shoot us amen we hand him the arrows quit handing him the arrows because he just go bling point point never even that that means nothing i wouldn't do that for his deer hunting especially bear hunting we won't want to do that would you why because it's powerless that bows powerless without a without an arrow with it amen so we give him the arrows to use on us let's read john 17 verse 16 through 19. they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth not a word thy word right as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sake i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth all right so what's going to clean you up the truth what's going to keep you clean the truth all right ii timothy 3 verse 6 says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from search turn away for this sword are they which creep into houses elite captives silly women women as white churches silly churches what silly doctrines laden with sins and led away with divers lust ever learning now they're learning they're learning about jesus and they're learning about this time of year they say is when you know jesus was born and all that we know that's not true we just kind of go along with the program not knock the rock the boat right all right every learning and never able look never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as janice and jamers withstood moses so do these also resist the truth wow men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith in other words denying that this is the truth but they shall proceed no further thank the lord for their follies shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was so thank god for that now let's look right here in revelations 3 14 and i just came to my mind everybody tomorrow or tonight say a prayer for brother claude weisinger he's having his gallbladder taken out tomorrow so just say a prayer for brother claude we called him thursday or wednesday or sometime and and he said for us to pray for him get that gallbladder out and he can get back home because it's really giving him a lot of trouble i don't know if any of you had gall brother gall bladder trouble before and surgery um he was been in a lot of pain so let's just remember brother claude and he lost brother johnny silke as he lost his song leader the guy that opened the door the guy that swept the floors he passed away with coven a couple weeks ago so just there's an empty hole there just remember then the little church there in bartlesville until the angel of the church will lay out the sands which is where us that's this is the end this is the seventh church age this is the last this is the finality these things saith the amen what amen the faithful and true witness not that he was a false witness but the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god as brother dale's been preaching that's what you see the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god is when god stepped into human flesh and became a baby not melchizedek not meeting not the captain of the host that met that that met david not the one that was with daniel in the lion's den because that wasn't like me and you but god came down in human flesh come through a womb just like you did took nine months to develop but it was immaculate conception not by the loins of a man but by the mind of god coming to a lady and saying look you're going to have a baby no one no man and she she pondered on a little while but finally she said what be it unto me according to what you just said what she must something rang true it was truth to that because you know why it happened glory when we see these things happen we know that it's truth if we're walking in the light but though so the beginning of the creation of god now remember if he's the beginning thank god he sent us a prophet if there's a beginning of the creation of god that means there's got to be something coming after that if not he would be the finishing of the creation of god we look at this and we say well this is the finishing of the church ages this is the finishing of the gentile age but it's the beginning because you know what there's somebody it may just be one person it's going to fulfill the scripture that says we which are alive and remain amen glory we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder that will take and finalize what that scripture's saying right there jesus christ came in human flesh died come back is picked up his body his body was made eternal does that sound familiar if you've got the baptism the holy ghost romans 8 says that that same spirit that dwells in you and jesus christ dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body and if you do have to go by the grave that's all right because you're going to come out a new what creation because the old creation is what our problem is because it was created in sin jesus christ was not created in sin he was created in purity amen so that true faithful and true witness now look the greek lexicon says alathinos that which is not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name because remember we we see where the prophet in in the church ages he tells us and look we go down through the church ages and we see what was lost the name was lost they don't baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ anymore well i mean we do but they didn't back in the church ages after about the third church age we're going to get into the seals first back again for a second but after the third church age that white righteous church started eroding the message of the hour their message of the hour and they took forth a lie like i said in in laodicea comes into nicaea and nicea accepts all this false doctrine okay who is that that's the devil god's not in false doctrine but we read where the true went to the false the true went to that meeting and because of earthly power satan overtook them and they just started accepting but because us coming in the end times the faithful and true witness but the real nature corresponding to the name now that's not saying that that martin luther and john wesley didn't have the characteristics of god they did they just didn't have all the characteristics of god you and i are the finality we are the amen we are the last and we've got to have that truth that truth has got to come back and it did come back and if you got the holy ghost today you got to believe that it came back because that's what that's the sounding board that's the hearing of the trumpet because remember we got to hear the last trumpet there is a last message to the gentile church age and you're listening to it right now amen you're listening to it right now not just me but all the ministers of this church and when you press play and when you talk about the lord in this end time you're the finality because i said before i'll read this quote again they don't have it but in the rising of the sun brother brown said there's been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there's got to come one god don't have three or four wives he's got one wife but she's in multiple form called the bride amen there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs in other words you got this beautiful car 67 mustang ain't got a motor nun in it but buddy isn't she pretty isn't she pretty richer's out there every day polishing that thing you can see your reflection there you can get inside and sit down in it but when you turn the key and want to go somewhere there's nothing even if it's got a motor it's got to have some gas to make the spark because you can have a big what 289 full barrel board strokes big old headers hanging off of it i heard one just a few minutes ago a mustang but he loves his loud mustang he let everybody know he loved it too but see that's what the world what are we doing what are we doing to show the world they're gonna drive down through here drag racing down through here why don't we drag race the word of god every once in a while amen start talking about god yes but he's out there with that thing and i mean here we are sitting there and boy they purr now when you do fire them up they purr but without one drop without one squirt of gasoline oh yeah it's as bound as worthless is that right there to get you somewhere amen same way with the word of god man has made it so convoluted which means they metal they meddled in it and it's all you look at this glass sometimes and you see glass that you can't really see through or or you them old me have you everybody seen one of those old mirrors that they made that were real thin and they made them they blew them and and you walk up to them and you look and your head's like this well that's the way that's the way they've done the word of god but there's a true mirror there's a true glass paul says well i look to a glass darkly but one day in other words truth is coming i may not see it paul says he said but i'm going to have a part of it i'm going to preach it and i believe god before they chopped his precious head off i believe god let him see the fruits of his because he wrote 80 of the new testament and we believe that that what is truth paul says you'll be judged by my gospel now why we have a and people have a problem saying we're going to be judged by a prophet and the bible says and you read it where paul says you'll be judged by my gospel he said if an angel from heaven comes down to this earth and preaches something different than you heard me preach let him be a curse and he said it twice so it was a double confirmation right but we can't take truth from nobody else right i don't understand that you know why because it's not according to your normal it's not according to the world's normal we are not normal y'all talk about me not being normal y'all not normal either praise god i want somebody to notice a faithful and true witness not jesus christ jesus christ in you and when somebody says something about the word of god you can say right there's where it says it right right there's where it says it as i've always said before you you talk to people about certain things and they say oh that was just the old testament i said well where's the ten commandments where's the ten commandments they're in the old testament yeah we put them out on the yard but we can't take the new testament or we can't take all the rest of the old testament see what i mean about this all getting you know it's like they tear the pieces out they want to tear out and add what they want to add and what did jesus what did jesus drew john tell us in book of revelations you add two i'm going to add the plays you take it out i'm going to take your name out they lost the name down to the church ages and god said he brother brown said god blew out their candle what he moved on god is in motion that's why you see those jews over there on that wailing wall they say god is in motion they're not just doing that for for looks they're doing that because they know god's in motion and so we should know god's emotion most of you think god's in motion like this because that's what you're doing right now where's aaron now if this don't stir your soul your spoon fell out of your bowl because there's got to be a truth we can fiddle around here all we want to but somebody somebody you're going to look and say well where'd he go remember the bible remember the prophet of god said you'll be looking around one day and say well where's brother wade well i thought he went deer hunting no you can't go deer hunting and he got a gun and took him away from us don't worry but then that still small voice will say what you missed it you missed it you missed it but there's a true people that's not going to miss it you've got to press yourself into that right it does not come just by human listen you you must deny your human beginning you must deny your because you're going to say well it was because aunt susie was a drunk i'm a drunk no that ain't got nothing to do with it now there are some hereditary traits in your body that you can't get away from they say i walk like my grandpa one hip's higher than the other one i've never looked back there so but they m jim tells me that all the time no mama does actually right because one hips higher in the other one you know what that is a trait that i don't want but i got that trait from my grandpa that's a human physical trait but i mean all this other stuff we lean on well mama mama couldn't work so i can't work either daddy couldn't hold a job so i can not forget it come on people move forward move forward in god listen to this and number two god's provided place of worship prophet god said now at the end time we see the things happening the way they are there's a great warning amongst the elected people of god to find what is right are we doing that to find what is right and it behooves us to know that now not somebody's theory but to know what is truth what the bible says is truth because it'll be too late one of these days for us and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back he has to ever remain the same how about that what kind of assurance do we have that he ain't gonna right in the middle of the ball game he's gonna change and we're gonna go in another direction no in his mind the war has already been fought the battle's already won and he wrote it in the book and told us that hey man we just gotta know what the book says he can never say something and then say well i didn't exactly mean it that way no we've done that before right he is infinite he knows the best to begin with we say things that we think is best then after a while we take it back but god can't do that and remain god so if he is infinite he does not do that because he's a per he's perfect in every word he never utters a word unless it's what eternal all of his eternals was with him at the beginning his thoughts his attributes and they are only expressing themselves in the world today amen so we come to a place and we look and we see that we as believers and i don't want to say even message believers bible believers everything has got to come from this bible you can't take you know james dobson's a good guy and all dave ramsey and all these different christian men that are um max locato no they're they're good they're good for the nominal world but they do nothing for me you and i have been called to take what not be a baby anymore we're supposed to take it and bring it on up to right here so we're supposed to take what the bible says listen to a good bible preacher if you don't go to a church where they don't read about where they just read quotes or read from so and so bear get away from them that's why we read the bible it's like brother dale said 90 of the time listen to me wake up 90 of the time jesus was quoting the old testament right 90 460 scriptures were fulfilled at calvary from the old testament jesus was quoting paul was even quoting when paul would say something it would be quoted from the old testament amen all right is that okay that's okay that jesus can do that right and then now we come down to paul paul takes and quotes the old testament all right and he brings it up and says you'll be judged by what i say but we go back in the old testament and they said no i don't think that's right who are you but william branham 90 of the time was quoting bible whatever he was saying had a bible background because he was a bible prophet he was not a prophet that just come and just come in and said i'm just this big no he never said nothing about being big or anything he took you to the word of god he pointed you to christ he didn't point you to a theology amen he didn't he pointed you to the truth so we say oh yeah that jesus quoted the old testament yep boys believe that paul quote yep don't believe that yep that's good brother brown praise oh no no but listen paul was quoting the old testament jesus was quoting the old testament this prophet in the end time was quoting old and new testament old and new testament was being quoted and being revealed revealed to us amen everybody okay with that so let's turn to revelations six i know we read the seals not too long ago in in this series but i want to take it in a little bit different angle because as we said before there's been brides brides churches but there's been a bride in every church age we look in revelations 3 and we see revelations 2 and 3 he says unto the angel of the church of ephesus so what's an angel a messenger that would be paul then you got to the angel of church and smyrna right that was irenaeus and we saw where the prophet put these together by the holy spirit i believe to where each age corresponded with their church age messenger and with a characteristic of what happened in that church age that okay with that we all right with that amen okay but we see that the book of revelations to psalm is a mysterious book and it's become a little more mysterious as man has been putting in their own ideas because as we see that there's a lot of times and thank god that he sent us a prophet how many times do i need to say that because when we look at this and we say how can the bride be in heaven the church be on earth and jesus coming on a white horse well god sent us a prophet to say hey there's a difference in a bride and a church this is a remnant this is the true shirt amen and then you look at it though and you know what you do just like hate it right you say that ain't nothing but the truth it can't be no other way than that but you've been taught a different way because you know what a lot of you came up through denominations that you swore by your eternal life you thought you had or had that father son holy ghost was a way to baptize amen hello and then a trinity right was three persons in a godhead that's right you can't have three persons and have just one amen but you swore by yeah i say you because you know what i went to the church of wade dale for about 20 years which was whatever happened happened but i knew the message was right so i didn't grow up believing the father son holy ghost and all these different things i knew god wasn't that confused and that's what you got to put your confidence in that god's not confused but he is going he he's not confused and he will put you somewhere to not be confused amen please if you're confused here you need to ask questions because we try to make it just as plain as we can make it right amen but this book of revelations 6 verse 1 it wasn't taught by paul paul was already passed on to the other side when this was written but paul said grievous wolves will come and we're going to read in second thessalonians paul says now we beseech thee brethren by the coming of the lord don't be shaken in mind we're going to read it so don't don't turn to it that man of sin must first be revealed the son of perdition paul is prophesying that there'll be a group of people that's going to expose the devil but see he didn't expose him all the way he was down here in the first church age all these other characteristics of god had to come out in these church ages but right there in revelation 6 verse 1 through 8 there was many commentaries on that scripture there was clarence larkin and all the different ones and the armenians had a different way and the baptists see it a different way and the presbyterians see it a different way and a lot of message believers see it a different way listen there's not just confusion out there but but what happened in 1963 god eventually sent us a vindicated prophet to show us because listen we were taught many commentators said that that right there i saw let's read it right here when a lamb opened one of the seals and i heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts now they didn't have a clue who the four beasts were right but we know who they are saying come and see and i saw him behold a white horse oh beautiful beautiful white horse not dirty pure beautiful white oh man and there was a guy sitting on top on it oh with a bow oh he was going to conquer that's what the bible says right so most commentators said well that's the holy ghost riding down through the church ages conquering brother branham and mighty conqueror in 1957 and 1959 he preached that scripture as the white horse rider and the one sitting on was the holy ghost riding through the church ages but when he come to the revelation where god said hey i'm done with this i'm done with this confusion i'm done with all this uh you brother branham you've preached from 1947 to 1963 and you brought them back to at least some people are believing that water baptism in the lord jesus christ is correct that there is no such thing as a trinity that there is no such thing as an eternal hell because you'd have to be eternal to be in hell and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god and god ain't in hell for an eternity no so the hell was created for the devil and his angels now they're gonna burn for whatever time but it doesn't matter we're not going to be there amen so but now how many come through denominations and now they'll preach you the hell's eternal and you don't want to go to an eternal burning hell i've heard it preached like daddy says take in fry you over hell like a weenie oh if you don't come hell your mama got saved right like this you know you understand what i mean tradition we don't want tradition we want truth and i saw him behold a white horse and he had selling him had a bow and the crown was given to him and he went forth conquering him to conquer man that sounded like a pretty good guy brother donnie's a white horse it's a man he's got a bow in his hand looks like he's got a little bit of power huh and he's going forth conquering and to conquer and we think wow that's beautiful but the prophet of god was sitting in that room and that angel came to him and said that's not what that is that's not me in other words that's not god has nothing to do with god that's the opposite guy brother brown said i'd have made a horrible mistake because he had wrote notes to preach that the white horse rider was the holy ghost god said nope had enough of that i'm done with it this is the revelation i'll read it to you right here let's read number three before we go back to revelation 6. number three in the first seal they said now here's a white horse and a white horse is a power a charger and said the man that sat on him was the white horse was the holy ghost that went forth in the early age and conquered that age for the kingdom of god he had a bow in his hand which meant like cupid he shot the arrows but remember he had no arrows never in there wake up never in there did he have an arrow but see that was that was that was hid that was hid because look shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of god and he conquered now that sounds good right sounds all right it sounds all right now that sounds very good but it isn't the truth no sir it doesn't white does mean righteous we realize that white means righteous the teacher taught it that it was the holy spirit conquering in the first age but my revelation of it by the holy spirit is not that way whoa that's why brother ray went from preaching to 25 000 people to 20 because they did not believe what he was saying but it was it come down to the truth not a truth it was the truth my revelation by the holy spirit is christ and the holy spirit is the self-same person only in a different form so if here stands christ the lamb remember right here the lamb stands open one of the seals here's the lamb and there's a nut there's a white horse rider and another person gets on that horse now that's okay if you're a trinitarian you can put two or three everywhere but when you've got one god which is the lamb which is jesus christ fixing to reveal something to you and there goes something away from you so here stands christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he's standing here with the books in his hands what the bible says and i saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals which was in the book and there goes the white horse rider see so it wasn't the holy spirit now that's one of the mysteries i love this right here that's one of the mysteries of the last day how that christ can be the three persons in one it's not three different people father son holy ghost being three gods as the trinitarians try to tell us it's three manifestations of the same person or you might call it three offices so now let's let's get back to this to save time go down to the very bottom right there so how could christ be out there on a horse and be standing here with a book in his hand now that just makes all kind of good sense doesn't it but all during the year years of the church ages they thought that was the same person but it's not here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and they're out there with a white horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't so it isn't christ and i bet them theologians their eyes rolled back in their head and they got dizzy they said what do you mean but you know what you keep reading and you put scripture together with scripture and you get out of that trinitarian idea that there's three people running around here and you'll see that if if there's two people remember how many spirits did i tell you there were two not three plus one amen not father son holy ghost and and evil or lucifer nope there's one god and there's one devil now if here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a person on a horse who is that person that person is not christ that's the devil because now look he has no boat we know he went through the first seal he went through and and you need to read seal book again maybe but here stands a lamb with the book of hand there goes the white horse rider what he conquered by his doctrine because through the first three church ages he was that little foxes that spoiled the vine he was that grievous wolf has crept in denominations there was no denomination until this church age right here but the makings of it was right here baby form as christ started in a baby form so does satan starting to babyform and they rode together because you know what but you turn over to revelations 19 and you see a man on a white horse riding with a group of people into the millennium right and he's got one thing that that white horse in revelation 6 that white horse rider didn't have the word of god printed right here you and i are the manifestation of that word of god because we're right behind him amen amen oh brother wade i can't ride a horse you will then don't be scared a little bright it's all been figured out for you if you'll just quit figuring it out for yourself amen second thessalonians let's read everybody with me say amen amen oh i'm sorry we got to go back to go back to revelation 6. sorry go get it brother anderson you good and i saw the lamb open one of the seals and i heard it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts says come and see now we know who the four beasts were in ezekiel it tells us it's the lion the ox the man and the eagle which is what the holy ghost the characteristics of the holy ghost right the light boldness of the line the some of y'all coming to church and can't keep your eyes open that's the ox trying to get it do its work the shrewdness of a man it's not you know what it that right there that uh knowledge is not knowledge of satan and that's not knowledge to do algebra that's knowledge to know whether what i'm telling you is the truth or not that's holy ghost knowledge then the linox man and the eagle now what is the eagle anointing which is what we're living under now an eagle goes higher and further yes that's right amen all right you ready and i saw him behold a white horse and he said on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he got forth conquering the crown was given something had to be given to him and he went forth conquering him to conquer now watch and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there without another horse now look another horse but not another writer right many commentators when you look at the four beasts of the four um sorry the four horse riders of the book of revelations how many of you have seen that picture it's four different people sitting on four different horses that wasn't true brother brown said he got off of this power or this horse climbed up on another horse same person thank god for that they want another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given to him a great sword what a sword is a word so that red age or that red columba right here where 68 million people were killed christians were killed why because of what they believed they wasn't killed because they didn't look good they weren't part of a no they didn't believe what the catholic church has instituted right in the beginning of denominations amen when he had opened the third seal i heard the third third beast say come and see and i'll be held a little black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand now remember that we know that's the catholic church and all the different ones paying novenas a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see though not hurt the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal let's get to it real quick and then we'll be we'll read the rest of this on ii thessalonians i looked to behold a pale horse and his name that said on him was death remember he was death to begin with he just didn't have a name yet but see when we had a prophet of god come and expose satan by the false doctrine that men have put in the bible because the bible's not false but what man has put in the bible to say that this is true and this is false it exposed satan it showed us where he was at and what he was doing amen and it wasn't that brother branham had to get a revelation that he was out there in the bar he got a revelation he was sitting that he was in that church and he was religious and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name it said on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill was sword now not sword they killed with the word and with hunger what starving the people from listening to the word of god and with death what spiritual death is way worse than natural death and with the beast of the earth which would be all the other that's what we have to put up with amen so now let's read second thessalonians i know part of it's here but some of you they have this let's go to the last one and read the whole ver from 1 through 12. and go to the go past that one brother anderson and go to the one i gave you in the back back here because it's got more scripture we're reading from 1 to 12 1 verse 1 to verse 12. there we go now look that word up besiege now i beseech thee brethren this is paul paul says i beseech thee brethren listen to what i'm saying actually besiege means to beg i'm begging you to listen to what i'm saying paul says now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him everybody believed paul was a prophet right okay that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of christ is at hand now not a 24-hour day now watch let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first right and we see that happening now and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition but where is he who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped yes so that he has god sitteth in the white temple of god showing himself that he is god oh my back in ezekiel it talks about the king of tyrus oh king of tyrus you're you're a great guy you've walked up and down in eden you've done all these great things but you come down to right here you got a man that might have been a baby for but you got a man standing here because remember when this first seal breaks in its natural form we're not here the man of sin is going to have to swhat the mystery of iniquity has got to be made known to us but what it does it makes the mystery of iniquity what's iniquity knowing to do better and don't do it or doing something you know you shouldn't do because the bible tells you look you look read it right there in the bible and you say well i don't believe i can do that that's the mystery of iniquity iniquity is being told now that's not being ignorant right ignorant is you just don't know you've never been taught big difference in that right and iniquity that's why i'm i believe the first seal was the most important seal because if it wasn't open to that problem if he would have stepped up in that pulpit and preached that the white horse rider was christ riding on a white horse he would have exalted satan to that position right there but god wouldn't let it happen thank god he takes care of his word he wouldn't let it happen he said no he said that thing riding out there he said that's the devil and you better watch him because he was right here at one time who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god or that is worship though so he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god not like him is god remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholded that he about be revealed in his time you know what was withholded me and you paul was down here in the first church age he knew there was more people to come all up through here right and the mystery of iniquity would not be revealed down here and be revealed here because why it's the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does all ready work two thousand years it's had to perfect itself only he who now letteth will let we know who that is god until he the bride be taken out of the way so the mystery of iniquity satan is not going to incarnate the pope or whoever you want to think it is until we get out of here then he's going to say i'm not like god he's going to say god's here wow in the whole world the whole world except even a little remnant of the of the five foolish virgins are gonna take it and swallow it up and say we finally found the great man right whole world but there's 144 000 going to look at him and there's two witnesses that's going to preach to him and 144 000 is going to believe who he really is that that satan incarnate but the whole world is going to say see look what does the whole world need right now what does the whole world need right now they need a savior they need somebody to step on the scene and say i got the answer i'll fix your economy i'll make sure everybody gets the vaccine i'll make sure this i'll make sure that why we not heard from the catholic church for a while from the pope he's working don't worry he's working because he's going to have to do some things before he's revealed to the world but we know right and like i said before it's not the one person it's satan it's the devil doing these things for the mystery of iniquity death already worked only he who now led us we'll let what god's going to let it happen until he the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming what not in the world in me and you right here this temple i don't want that thing sitting in my temple showing himself that he is god listen if you don't worship the lord jesus christ you are worshiping satan remember there's only two i worshiped the devil all them years didn't you but now what's moved from then till now now he's moved into the church and said hey everything's okay you feel you when brother louise sang that song you went whoo oh lord i know you hear that that chill went up my spine and i'll promise you one thing the devil don't sleep in church he might make you but he don't sleep in church he's got his eyes and his ears trained on me and you and he's waiting on us to slip up listen we cannot fail somebody's got to expose the devil and show him that we are god incarnate as he wants to incarnate a man god himself has incarnated his bride but we've got to look at this folks and see the separation we've got to see that you have a lamb inside of you and there goes all those things all those ideas all those different things all those different doctrines that you used to have they got to go away from you you can't live with them that's right god won't dwell in an unclean vessel for the mystery of iniquitous already worked oh really and then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what the word and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders it wouldn't surprise me a bit if the pope walks in and says we've had 5 000 people healed from this virus and prove it what are we going to do about it the whole world is going to be deceived by it and they're going to go okay we find the man you understand what i mean he's not going to be some mean something that's going to come in bible said he come in with what flattery comes in with flattery he comes in real easy real deceptive even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because what it didn't it didn't they didn't if they did it wasn't that they didn't receive the truth they didn't receive the knowledge of the truth or the love of the truth because they received not the love of the truth what is love the holy ghost charity that they might be saved for this cause god shall send them strong delusion you say god's going to purposely blind these people no he's going to give them a choice and once they make their choice he's going to give them a strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness wow wow but when god come to the end time musicians come when god come to the end time he said i've saved the best for last because it's going to be the worst i'm going to send him the truth and you're either going to turn it down or you're going to accept it you got to make that choice if you see something in the word of god and it looks kind of strange to you search out the rest of the word of god amen search it all out search it out where where you don't go well my church says i don't really care what your church says i don't really care what this church says right it's what the word says it's what the truth said what did it say it said well let's read it i'll read it for you hold on just a minute i got it right here don't pull it up i got it right here louise hadn't even got a song yet so i'll get it for him okay he's an anthony every church age ends with this it has the different things that go through but it ends every one of them right here he that has an ear right let him hear what the spirit not the letter not the church what the spirit saith to the churches and if you're if you're prophet paul irenaeus martin different ones all the ones if they preach the truth then they're preaching christ and they're bringing you out of something revelation 19 says come out of her you got that come out of her my people what is her a church come out of her my people now let's get the her out of us hey man it's okay to switch doors switch churches but like daddy said he said don't bring that church with you in here all you're doing is changing a different place you hang your hat and your coat god will give he'll change you revolution they can the world can give you anything in the world the world can give you whatever the world can give you but he can't give you they can't give you eternal life they cannot give you the truth they can talk about a truth they can talk about this they care about that but this is the way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and today i've preached christ to you not a well we believe in a man we believe god sent a messenger didn't god send paul didn't god send peter didn't god send all those 12 apostles out into the world to do what preach the gospel why can't we believe that god uses man he used one today i hope and pray amen i'm praying that god will use you and me there's no look there's no big eyes and no little use there's no big ones among us i like what brother claude says he said we're just a servant a preacher can only preach what the congregation wants him to preach how many times have you come out here and you go to this little pathway and somebody downstairs will say i sure enjoyed that part at least they heard a part but i enjoyed that part because that was something i've been dealing with bro luis the other day sent me a text he enjoyed the service i'm gonna go ahead and tell you because there were some things that you had that you were dealing with that you had questions about right and they were answered right well there's a witness right there hey what but you say oh brother wait did it no forget that don't put a name and that was the truth talking to somebody that needed the truth that's the way it's supposed to work let's stand to our feet and if you need something today that's the way it's supposed to work believe god believe the truth stop believing a lie satan's a liar yes thank you kaylee joey backwards kaylee zoe thank you they're twins whatever but thank you for singing that song really meant a lot to all of us fear's a liar there is no error in god glory there is no fear in god how many times in the bible has he showed up anywhere and said fear not fear not so when you get in the darkness of your hour just just listen just listen to something say fear not prying with you my rod and my staff they comfort you glory i'm going to set you in the table i'm going to set a table in front of your enemies right who was that preaching on that one time said he said that's the worst thing you can do is beat your enemy in a battle and sit down and eat in front of them right that's right but that's what god said he was going to do he said i'm prepare a table before your enemies so you sit there and eat your muttons and all that and he just dry away because the devil i hate that guy i do you don't hate the devil oh yeah we feel sorry for him but he's caused all this let's sing a song god bless you if you have a need believe in your heart just say fear not jesus listen verse 26 on the top of mount zion [Music] [Music] when i reach that city on a
