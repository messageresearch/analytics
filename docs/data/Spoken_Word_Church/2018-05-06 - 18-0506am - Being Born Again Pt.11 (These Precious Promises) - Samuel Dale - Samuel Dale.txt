as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last days for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that's your faith and your hope might be in God seeing you out purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth about us forever man all right then we just jump over one to second Peter 1 it says silent Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God in our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory in virtue or by now through the calling so bringing us to and all whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these now the Prophet always them aside by these promises so that's what we'll be speaking on today by these promises as you might be partakers or the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge amen you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word know we have been quite some time sticking with the emphases upon the position that we're talking about and what we're trying to bring I hope it doesn't get boring to you because we've tried to drop down we had a real good time last night at the Bible studying in some things and talking about the things of God because you know I'm trying my best I asked the people or told them last night that what I would desire for you to do a brother one time you know he preached a message feed my sheep well I didn't understand him he later years later he told me he said I meant for you to feed my family said you just end them old deep things well I just walked away without having I didn't want to say nothing because if I had I know what were to say it I'd have said you appreciate why don't you teach your children the simple things and then they can understand the deeper things that I try to teach too but that was you know that was all right because see that's that's what I'm trying to do is break it down to talk about because they said their past couple of services I've mentioned it a lot then we say what is the new birth we say well it's the birth of the word well I agree with that good to see our brother and sister back there with us I'm glad to have you with us and we say to you welcome man one time welcome next time part of us you may have been here before if you have you get another what you just got a extra welcome all right but what I'm trying to do is to get us to realize what is the new birth all right and in understanding what the new birth is then we know that in that new birth is all that we have need of in God is the new birth all right now because that just starts the process but I'm trying to get you to think on these things called like I said we say we talked about the new birth we say what is the new birth then people say you know we will ministers we all do say well it's justification st. casing baptism the Holy Ghost well that's true but now children hearing that probably a lot of them we were life not life in it little Bella saying something that brother Dale said the other day about the new birth or not Bella Zoey saying you know and so you just sitting on the floor and talking so you be careful what you're talking about somebody might be listening but see I'm trying to get you and I to understand what's going on and see you as mother and father you tell your children we do the best we can trying to explain cause like I said those children we say just again same case baptism or logos and they said well what's justification you know what sanctification what's the baptism with Allah go see they don't get the full understanding so try to help them to understand and that way I can move on into the process because we've been so long right here on this one little point trying to get it to where we can move on into the growth development of Peter and add to your faith virtue or dollars to enforce patience and all I can see because doing that now we say well what is the new birth what's the birth of the word and that's that's that should be settled in all of our hearts and minds Jesus Christ was the sower of the seed the son of man he sowed the seed all right He gave His life he went to Calvary gave his life and then the Holy Spirit came back to quicken what he had sold down in the hearts of those disciples right he he opened up their understanding of the word that they heard alright and seasoned there is your new birth all right let's see we we have been so long in our lives handled and you know ever what you call it living in the realms of of people and their ideas until you say to most people what would happen if you went to most churches today and say what is the new birth well wanted to say we spoke in tongues well other churches say well we shout it we cried we done this we done that well that's not the new birth that's that's the aftereffect see that's what happens I've drew it but yet that's what people think they say where are you born yes I I remember when I cried in it and I like whoa that's not to birth I've tried to get that to you over and over for 50 years now that's not the birth the birth brings the baby into the world right baby natural baby natural birth comes into the world all right and then it starts crying after the baby gets here we'll see we're calling what we do in our natural lives which is the stimulation upon our senses of life or our doings and all we call that to birth you say well what did you well I cried well that's wonderful but that's what you're supposed to be doing after the birth comes that's not the birth the birth is the birth of the word and the prophets it is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and then you say that to people well I didn't get no revelation when I got born again we don't remember when God was dealing with it you don't remember the thing you know we call it our of being you know brought under conviction things happening like that you know that would bring us to a place that we become of a realization of that we're sinners well what do you think that is that's God dealing with you but that's not your birth that's the after-effects that's the things are the attributes that you're going through the life you're going through the birth is a birth of the word the let's see then that's so hard to try to get people to realize that hey you know what is the new birth it's the birth of the word Jesus Christ preached for three and a half years to those disciples never gave one of them eternal life he had to die go to Calvary come back on their Pentecost then it says he'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever he said and teach you things to come he opened their understanding of the word he brought that to them life in their soul of the new birth right then they cried then they shouted didn't it you know then the emotions come but we put the emotions first we think that the new birth is the emotions that we have no it comes because of the birth it comes because of the realization well brother tell you this is your just trying to tell me that I didn't get saved why would you think that because somebody has told you those things is the way you are when you're saved the salvation is first the baby gets here right the baby is born now is it true that Jesus was telling Nicodemus the natural birth is a type of the spiritual birth water blood life all right see then the new birth is what God dealing with you calling you to repentance now you're dealing with justification because that brings you to repentance and that justification then is a chopping off of your pie sins remitting your sins because you're you know that he's dealing with you all right but that's not to birth brother down you mean when i repent into my sins that wasn't a born-again experience i'm not saying it wasn't but i'm saying the big biggest portion of it's not I'm not gonna tell you you didn't get saved because you got examples in the Bible you've got the Apostles for three and a half years before they got their new birth but you got them they're 3,000 outside it got the new birth right daughter you've got them at the house of Cornelius right there so don't discredit I'm not saying that you're not saved I'm saying make sure don't put it this don't because you repented of your sins the goodness of God the Bible said leadeth us to repentance you know realizing God is real and realizing that he's dealing with our hearts and our lives and we're accepting him as our Savior we'll remember why the Prophet said it's good for you to accept him you've got to accept him he can only work on the basis of you accepting him but then has he accepted you and you realize justification is you accepting him as your Savior you asking him to forgive you of your sins you're repenting of the things that you've done in your life all right that's justification that's the water breaking of the of the natural baby all right but see then the next step is sanctification that God deals with you to clean up our lives clean up our spiritual parts of us our lives and everything - you know to keep then repenting and asking God to help us and goddess and he cleanses us he takes away those desires and we come up with new desires with ours the danger of people that's that what do you mean brother Dale I went to the altar I cried I used to do this I used to drink I used to smoke I used to run around with women I used to do that and I quit that you mean tell me I'm not saved I will remind you that Judas Iscariot went through justification of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and walked with him for three and a half years of sanctification but he never made it to the day of Pentecost am i right he never made it to the day of Pentecost to receive eternal life right so come on then don't you know just think about what I've been trying to bring to you and then you can say my experience in my experience I remember when God come up me in such a manner that I was weeping I was crying I was concerned all that's well and good all that's well and good but did it take you all the way justification and sanctification is dealing with you accepting God and you repenting of your sins and asking God to forgive you but when he gives you the baptism when the Holy Ghost that's when he accepts you right that's when he accepts you now you're right with the Prophet right see there's nothing to say well I accepted him it's whether or not he accepted you now you've got something to anchor it into the Word of God and to realize that Jesus sewed that seed down in those disciples the word for three and a half years but yet when they finished up after his capture and taking him in they proved that they wouldn't ride oh yeah Peter he was role he wasn't he was a robust man he grabbed a sword he whacked off that high priest servants the year yeah but when Jesus took that ear and stuck it back on and turned around and didn't fight Peter was ready to run with the rest of them and he did see then they didn't have the new birth you can't bring the new birth in the Old Testament where are you going to put it you can't put it except in the blood of Jesus Christ they had to tone but in the Old Testament as I've tried to explain they offered the animal sacrifices amen but that could not take away and give them eternal life because it was an animal life an animal does not have a soul he has a spirit part about him he has the certain degree in a memories certain degrees in things in there but yet he does not have the soul that's the difference between a dog and a human being see in Jesus Christ was a human being not just a dog why did he have to come and die if it wouldn't Rock if the Old Testament could take care of all the problems and the offering of the sacrifices and all of the doings if that was right and it was for the time but if it was enough why did you hop Jesus out to die see he had to die to release that soul out of him that that soul could come back into the people in the new birth so it's not just well I know I'm saved you can't tell me I say because I cried I accepted Jesus Christ and I just cried all amen don't you think Judas when his last hours were seeking some way to get rid of what his problems was but it didn't work because he had already sealed his doom do you understand what I'm getting at see then we say what is the new birth it's the birth of the word what do you mean all I got to do is read it no it's got to be birthed you and we planted a garden Friday Lisa said something to me yesterday and I said it's already coming up then he says it ain't done it either and they had enough time she said but when it comes up and be two shoots of that corn woman no huh see what do you do with a seed you hold it in your hands oh oh look what I've got look what I've got you got to put that in the ground the moisture has to get to the seed and then it sprouts open and comes alive right and see that's what the Lord Jesus done he planted that word and then the Holy Ghost came on to that any calls and quick on that word to those disciples and see that's that's been a hard point for me to try to get it across to you maybe it's me but you see there's no eternal life back in that Old Testament because Jesus Christ has not died there was a looking forward to you know that Jesus the scripture quarter he died for the sins of all well if he died for the sins of all you know no it's got to be applied it's got to come to you and I as an experience then what did your prophet say surgeries ever something you know I'll get it the minute was I got it laying here in a note he said the mystery of this day was to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost without a sensation but the person of Jesus Christ see now you go back to the man that found a track you remember the story he found a track and it said where will you spend eternity and he spends all of his life and all of his money trying to find eternal life right he went to all the preachers whenever were to get her to pray far it's been all kind of money you know the story he come to brother Branham and brother Brown said today you picked that track that's word started but you see we think it's got to be some kind of an emotional thing you go to a Pentecostal church today they're gonna try to get you speak in tongues you go to this one I want you to do this this one wants you to do that but what is it all based on it's the birth of the word the words you heard faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word it's impossible for you to be saved without hearing the word from somebody right it may be just mama send it to your daddy send it to your or something like adder or whatever but it's you've got to hear that word first then that word is made alive now you've got all of your emotions that you can go with you've got everything you can go with as to say I believe I done that I went I felt you know convicted I felt condemned and asked God to forgive me and I had this great experience I've heard many of you express it as to a great load of sin went off of you well that's true because look what you've done you repented of your sins but that don't mean it's you're saved right there that means you've started just like a baby you want to take your baby and you know brother Kernan Tim's got a little girl back there wouldn't it be something to walk out of the hospital they're going out to get in the car and brother Kern says who's going drive mama you can't drive in I can't who's gonna drive or the baby's gonna drive now that's real sensible intent but I don't want to eat on that to thank my salvation is involved in that away I won't stop them a little more sincere you don't go out and throw the keys to a you better not do it with a 10 year old or a 12 unless they drove a little bit of rounding you gonna get out of trouble you'd be like a lady would start home she'd never drove and and that right beyond the house that was a big old tree and they this lady took her and said I'm gonna teach you to drive what she just pulled up there on the road and stopped got out walked around told her slide over said Drive she said what I ain't never drove I don't know what to do just Geron grouchy did right dead center in the tree when that's as far as you made it was probably 10 foot from the tree you know but see that's not what it is see the experience is that we have the things that we have to go with it I'm not trying to destroy those things in your thinking I'm trying to destroy our thoughts of what is based upon that is not scriptural putting it then to work that we can say to the children to the adults to whoever that the experience is the same now here's one that's been hard for me tried to explain it you know this the last couple of missions you know this ain't even got to my nose but I tried to explain salvation in a simple form to get you to look at it and to see that Jesus Christ come and dealt with you and me called us to repentance and we repented then he deals with us with sanctification which most of us are not even Pentecostal right so we never were taught in the churches we came from about sanctification always Muse maybe the word or head of styles you know but we wasn't taught those things we were taught all you gotta do is believe you just get them come up to order and believe go to shake a preachers hand I'll get them to self Creed or get them to set to order or whatever I've always been like that little boy was when everybody else was saying the preacher asked them do you get saved everybody yeah I got saved like I said they come to one little boy and they said did you get saved he said nothing happened to me yeah I'm just honest I want something that's tangible or real not just a thought of my imaginations or some kind of a thought that I'm a Christian now because there I go to church well I don't cut my hair and I don't paint my face no I'm a Christian well what about those women out there that don't know those things or that Christian see I'm trying to get us to see that what we've been taught all of her life is really the thing that's killing us and it's taught so subtle or whatever the word would mean there it's talk so until I mean the people in sales that's all they know now come on Church I'm not against anybody or any church over here or whatever but what did come up here you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior amen you're born again well I'll remind you Judas Iscariot walked out away a long time then let's see you said well what else can you do you can accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and then you can walk in his word and study it and let it take a part of you until God does something to you himself the work he can work in you and live in you because what is it it's the birth of the word but it's not to give you a bunch of tracks and pies mouth well have you ever read this book this book this book you read all these books you're born again no I've told you before what I've done it I've read six books and one day and listened to tapes that didn't mean and at all that same time I was saying that I was not a born-again Christian and I had come out of a Baptist Church that I was an ordained deacon at 23 years old but yet I seen what the Prophet was talking about I knew there was something wrong something was wrong in the way we was trying to bring it because we were just bringing it as a thought or an idea or a concept brother would be had a good point he said you get him in with a hot dog you can get him out with a hamburger he said well what does that got to do with salvation his point was what if you can get people to come to the altar because of come up here in the shake hands with the preacher believe well then somebody else can praying them over to another one come up here now and and speak in tongues you get them into the hot dog you get them out with a hamburger anything else to would flop there to try to save them but see that we realize what salvation is salvation is God's own life coming to live in you now is that true salvation is God's own life coming to live in you and it could not come and live in you and Hill and the people in the Old Testament because Christ had not come and shed his life all right see the way most people think it any kind of a concept is all that you have to have it's not a concept it's not a doctrine or an idea it's the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you well I don't understand that then you tell me your son you tell me you're saved but you don't understand you don't understand what I say but yet oh I'm saved I believe I'm saying huh well like I've always told you from the day I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior till this day and that was five years five five years in the Baptist Church and been now fifty years in this message I never let a day go by that I don't thank him for saving me that I don't ask him to save me well I asked him long time ago died believe it that's God I drove down the straight amen I did too but you're not listening to what I'm saying I'm thanking him for saving me and I'm wanting him to explain to me I am saved well god dude believe it now according to the Bible it's still in the scriptures at home brother Herman Garland you say I'll get tickled at it he'd say it's in the Bible called I read it this morning you know it's in the Bible that the devil believes in God and trembles if you ever believed in God enough to tremble you know gets nervous and all perplexed the devil does but is he saved no well you're trying to destroy my salvation but what by telling you that you need Jesus Christ as your Savior I said something one time in the church and brother got offended at me about it and I I asked him what he said and he said you said so and so and I said well what's that problem he said you got my people to seek in God I said I apologize to you for saying something to your church that you didn't believe but I'll never apologize for trying to get people to seek God I said till the day I die I'll be seeking God to have something to where he can do and sing great marvelous things from the dead raised to everything else but yet still ain't basing it upon that because you putting those things on some form of a sin sation or a thought the Prophet said the baptism of the holy ghost without a sensation but he never said the baptism when the holy ghost without an experience you've got to have an experience have you had the experience of the new birth well I'll just I'll just believe the message so does the devil and I'm honest and sincere about it I I never have understood one of the people of the world couldn't under couldn't believe this message I don't understand that the simplicity of the gospel expressed by a seventh grade educated man to explain salvation explained the things to us and why people can't understand the simplicity how much more simple could it be made than what it was made into our hands and what about it God sewed down the word into your heart that brings a conviction to you and you realize you need to be saved and you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior but then why do you stop and not continue on they don't they make you that much more sense here that are to make you that much more cry out to God I don't understand that why that you could get so you can get in God I don't believe you could ever get enough in God to where you got where you didn't want more come on do you think so you think you could ever get so much of God that you don't want no more of God they something wrong with your mentality let alone anything else any no revelation whatsoever involved you sure a dummy in your head sorry but that's as blunt as I can make it but you see Church do you realize ever born again believer now listen to this ever born again believer in the world is born the same ever natural baby natural born baby and we're not talking about the Syrians we're not talking about accidents happening we're talking about normal babies all normal babies are born the same right water blood and life right and that constitutes the natural birth within the spiritual birth ever born-again believer has the sign yeah but then people done something we didn't do that I didn't speak in tongues and then people spoke in tongues well what's that got to do with it you're making some form or something you do or don't do instead of accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and letting him then through the opening of the word bring you to a place that he can accept you well I didn't know he had to accept me well what kind of salvation of you God is it based on this because you accept him the Bible said how can they call on him who they have not heard all right can I go with the rest of that and how can they hear without a preacher and you know preacher told me how to be saved I just accepted Jesus Christ no not to be a preacher to be mom and dad to be anybody right faith comes by hearing right how can we hear unless somebody teach us all right but see then ever born-again believer is born the same I don't care what happens you've got to go through now you're a prophet isn't one express these things he said the new birth consists of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost go to the message of birth playing I'm looking at it you've got to go through those three stages just as a natural baby goes through the three stages to get the natural baby here then it cries then it's outs then it speaks in tongues then it had a great time right the spiritual birth is repentance and asking Jesus Christ to save us forgive me of my sins and he watched those sins away then he begins to you know you want to go to church you want to do good and everything and through the opening of the word it keeps driving out those things until the Bible speaks of that unclean spirit driven out of you but now you know yourself now right there's the danger right it'd be nice to have the unclean spirit driven out right but that ain't the nuber I'm in the Bible where you at cause according to my Bible the unclean spirit goes out of a man walketh in dry places to seek his rest and find us none but he comes back to the house and finds it now I'm quoting you Bible it comes back and finds a house wept and that's Jesus explaining it and said he comes back in and said to work the person is worse than seven times state come on dieter Church ask me where it's that will find that scripture but that's in the gospel that he's explaining it see because that unclean spirit went out because you getting you desires and you thoughts and ideas that doesn't mean you're saved that means you started in the right direction we see then the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes into the living you which is the person of Jesus Christ coming to live in you and as he does there's the new birth and see what started over here is finished as the natural baby starts in the wound of the mother and then one day is finished by the fact that it is a exited out of the wound to bring it to natural life so is this spiritual birth in Christ well I never heard nobody preach about a new birth like that we just we just all we have to do is just shake hands well alright that's enough for you then they start shaking hands with people and saying I'm saved but you see I want something that'll keep me right did you keep your religion brother branham when you lost your wife and your son or your daughter no did it kept me that's why people you find them scraps he playing along the way that's in statue of a perfect man a blasphemy is not one scrap piece of ministers and Christians laying along the way why because they didn't get something to hold them they got something to try to hold on to but when the cares of life that's what Jesus was doing in the parables explaining it you know the cares of life and this this and that in the other involving on the stones and all you've read your Bible you're to be at least understand he was explaining what would take place to individuals how that when it did come down to life that we would either be holding on long enough for him to give us eternal life or we go back to the thing we come from it's alright to accept Jesus Christ we've got to do that but has he accepted you the disciples three and a half years accepted Jesus huh but you know what to come back when then you know what was left you remember there were 70 of them they walked away because they couldn't follow it you remember that in the gospel they walked away because they couldn't do it what happened to them the church you see what I'm trying to get you to see ever new birth is the new birth and it's a sign forever individual you must come through repentance of your sins accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior letting God do you in through the word that you read and study and pray let it cleanse you and and get rid of a lot of those desires and the thoughts that you had wrong and all that's well and good and give you new desires you want to go to church you want to be good you want to do all the things but then his own life has to come and live in you partial birth of the word it's the words you've took inhaled then it sets you to a place then of what and see that's where did I get into trouble trying to express it I wouldn't the one that said it your prophet said it's the Holy Ghost in every age the Holy Ghost was not eat down during the dark ages it was the word that was eat down the Holy Ghost was the same in every church age now come on as I said you read in in in the starting in chapter 2 of Revelations and you read these church age there's not a church age in there that it says anything is about tongues it doesn't say in the Bible you know that it's tongues as we make it he that hath atonement huh huh he that hath an ear effort church age read it yourself ever church age out of the seven each one of them had said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the evidence has always been the same in every Church age the evidence is the same in every church age the new birth is the same you don't have a new birth over here for this age and then one over here differ for this see that's man's ideas and his thoughts and concepts that have blinded the eyes of the people it's always been in the hearing on the day of Pentecost it didn't say they were all speaking in tongues of the same life he said how here we ever man in our own tongue wherein we are borned the secret has always been in the hearing because there's your evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word or not right come on did the Prophet even himself God had to straighten him out because he believed that it was love he had believed many things of the evidence and God came to him in a dream and straightened him out and showed him that it was to believe the word it's always been in the hearing the secret that's what happened on the day of Pentecost read your Bible there's eight or ten different nations involved are it names them from this nation this nation is nice people will gather for every where and Peter was standing up talking and they said how here we ever man in her own tongue of course we could Baptist we had it all figured out we had the twelve standing there Peter talkin we had eleven interpreters you never heard down we had eleven interpreters to explain to the people around there what Peter was saying well that sounds good that ain't what the Bible say it the Bible said how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born the evidence has always been in the hearing and it's always been the Holy Ghost in every age it's not the Holy Ghost in one agent in something else in another age it's the Holy Ghost in every age why because it's the birth of the word which is Christ is the birth of the word what's birth within you is Christ Paul said is not I that liveth but Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in this flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God he was telling you what the birth was Peter tells you them of like precious faith that we just read the Bible is not written then listen I've tried to explain it and if you look at all the Bible's not written to a sinner the only thing a sinner can do by reading the Bible is to realize he's lost but he can do the same thing by reading your life if you're living it in front of them if you're living a Christian life in front of him he'd be more condemned by your life that you're living than he would be if you read the Bible himself right see God wants living Bibles people to walk and carry the word then the world can be condemned by but they're they're not condemned it's because they read the letters on the page oh that was like somebody wrote all right God laid down the word and the holy spirit quickened it on the day of Pentecost and they came forth with the new bird whatever happened there has to happen to ever age ever time ever person ever been well my mom and dad did they got it this way and I got it this way now if something's wrong what you got somebody didn't get what was goes to be got in the right place because as I said to start with what was it ever natural baby never natural baby they no shortcuts come on sisters you ought to be saying hey glory I remember that I know I'll like that they need no shortcuts in the natural birth water breaks it would have been at my house when water broke with one of the kids and I was trying my best to get my wife to go get in the car to go to the dock to the hospital her water had broke every time she'd walk across the floor to go to the bathroom I had to clean up the floor because she said we ain't leaving until you mop this floor I said at least go sat down find your place and sat down I'll get the house cleaned up we'll go but it always is water breaks then blood then laughs well why can't we realize the new birth the new birth is justification repenting of your sins asking God to forgive you accepting him as your Savior sanctification is him coming and through a work of the word that you're taking and reading and study he's cleansing you inwardly not your body in your spirit he's cleansing the soul he's driving out that unclean and when he gets that drove out then he can come in but it's the opening of the word that drives that out we're going to find out eventually that the seals has got to break to individuals to bring them up statue a perfect Mansell that's where I'm headed but listen see it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he's dealing with you he's not dealing with somebody else so that new birth is the birth of the word that you've heard in the natural story there is no way to carry the seed except in the body of the male right come on in the body of the male is the natural seed and that's the way it is in the spiritual reproduction someone must tell you someone must teach you someone must speak to you about God in his ways and all that's well and good when you tell them you need to be saved you tell the children you need to be saved you need to come to order all that's well and good see you think I'm trying to do away with things I'm trying to show you you were doing things right but yet don't stop I have never told anybody I think you've got the Holy Ghost because it ain't none of my business for number one and for number two I'd be taking God's place and then gonna do it I'm going to tell you never stop seeking God and if you stop seeking God anywhere in your Christian experience then there's one thing for certain you didn't have it right to start with is that plain enough you didn't have it right to start with if you stopped you don't believe in backsliding I don't believe in being lost I don't believe in saved today and lost tomorrow I don't believe that all right but you see that birth of the word causes it it's the same as the natural birth and it constitutes the new birth and listen we read that Peter was saying here that this message he was bringing was addressed to those of like precious faith as I said while ago then you you can't bring it you you can't say well my baby I talked to my baby before it got here now I understand I'm not lost understand and believe things but I don't believe that baby as it's in our listening is talking back to you you know I don't get it that away you know people to say well you can you can hear your voices yeah they can hear your voices but they they don't know what words you use oh you don't well now you tell me how come a Chinese baby as quick as it's born it don't speak Chinese you know that every baby that's ever born naturally speaks the same language oh you ever had a baby it was morning start speaking Chinese and nobody in the family spoke Chinese now get out of it that's what I try to do I try to make it so carnal until our carnality shows up there's no such thing the baby learns from what he hears he don't come out of the wound speaking Chinese it comes out of the word speaking crazy so that's all they can do is cry but it gets your huh listen Peter said that he was addressing this message to those of like precious faith all right addressing it to people that had the new birth that he had because they were the only ones that could understand like precious faith so it's addressed to the church it's not addressed to the world I'm looking at those quotes you supposed to been agreed in one statue a perfect man so you'd order go through it he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement what is God's requirement he requires these virtues because he spoke of them now come on that's I've been over it and over it one more time 120 in the upper room two two three and a half years got the Holy Ghost they didn't just get it down here at the bottom they got it up here where it says brotherly kindness and Holy Spirit and that's called a faith of the Father but 3,000 outside never heard but one message how so canoeists were they heard one message and they received the new birth eternal life just like the rest of them but what did it make them how time to get to it but what did it make them what did it put them to be we're good let's get it this evenin cuz every baby is born to Nashville baby ever spiritual baby is born a spiritual baby we're babes in Christ desiring the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby that's what Peter was explaining how to get to her he was because when he received the Holy Ghost it put him at a higher position than it did those outside but ever baby born since that time there's no such thing as a baby born since that time being born like the apostles were you've got to be born as a baby right you born as a baby you desire the middle I mean you desire them to eat meat but you've got how milk you got to grow you've got to have it in there we'll get this evening scriptures and going with it right but see church Peter was telling them you that are sitting there listening to me he said you've received Jesus Christ your savior you have the new birth you have eternal life in your soul and that's who I'm addressing this to cause we remember now according to my Bible I think it's still left in there that no man can call Jesus Christ what come on no man can call Jesus Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost because you're saying what somebody else says right is that scriptural all right no man can call Jesus Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost himself all right so the only way you can be of like precious faith is to have the baptism when the Holy Ghost and that's what Peter's saying then he goes on to talk about these great things that have you with how you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through Jesus Christ Peter's explaining to those you're born again you have eternal life that said you need more then we used to have a little thing on the wall at the house and you could go look at the kids and it had he's a babe you know had weighed Terrance and Anna all right it started off weight as a baby a little baby Terrance a little baby and I was a little baby we know I'm honest they got about ten years older piece than their in their days and you know what you say well boy I always said just stay right there you know you you're thinking about how great it was for them right during that period of time and you say wouldn't it be something they just stayed that age you know they were so mellow so sweet so nice everything was good they were this little kids right but that don't work why is it that don't work how do they grow up right and then you see them go across the wall as they get older and older and you told me there's where it was wait at 13 look at him at 14 that Ohio trying to slim down he'd sneak around let it out a little bit you know ain't gonna get into Terrence and Anna Wade's not here right do you know what I'm talking about they growed up we don't want to finish up all over these then after it's done you wouldn't want them to stay young after a while I begin to see my wife's nature into the children I don't know trouble see in mind there's mean enough okay you get that one I don't trouble seeing my nature and the kids there's mean enough but I could see the mother's nature to raise the children cuz she raised him you know I don't know not co-working gentle motor and she took him places they had to depend on her she's one that raised him I've done a good job all right what you see they finally growed up you know after a while you begin to realize now think about God that's what I'm trying to explain think about after a while you that well now look what they developed into now right there they got a job they went to work they started doing things you know and they quit acting like babies and started trying to grow up right you could see yourself well they're not the way God wants to do it I mean what is the what is the purpose as we as in Christ's ministry what's the purpose of every Christian what is the purpose of every Christian apart the the whole fact of Christianity is based upon faith in God we know those things we do you realize what it is to be a Christian that you want your nature to be displayed in your children right I've told you before about it there was a friend of ours that he was a run a bank you know he was a banker and he told me one day he said Sam said whatever you're doing said y'all raised a good bunch of kids well you know that was something I mean if I'd have seen an old mean drunk out learn he said that I could listen to him a little bit and say was it okay they made any point but when the banker says your children have turned out good children see then you think a little better so then I spit it up you know but then I went back down because I realized I didn't do it my wife done it she was when it raised him so it was her nature that was instilled in doing cuz that's the way it was supposed to be okay come on listen but it's written to Peter is telling that church there are those people he's not writing to the world now listen carefully second first Peter is to talk to you about your needing to get born again and think second Peter he's telling you how to get to where he was and the way he had come are you listening read your Bible second Peter is telling you how to come to where he was Peter in that gospel of what God wanted for mankind to be like and he says I'm writing them to this to those of like precious right I'm writing it to the church those that are in Christ Jesus to try to get the church to realize what they need and the kamon you folks have been reading the message what did he get into talk about how to build a tabernacle he said what is God's tabernacle he said God's tabernacle is not buildings and houses and churches and things like that God's tabernacle is building you you are god's tabernacle you're the one to carry God to the world that they can see Christ all right and see by one spirit then the scripture says that we're all baptized into one body now listen well ago you may have sent us load back when I said never born-again believers born to same evidence the Holy Ghost is the same for everybody [Music] now can you see that scripture in Corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all baptized into one body same way now come on did the Prophet explain it like this that if God ever done anything the first time he done it he done it the way that he wanted to do it and he never changed from that is that true so then the first baby that was born every baby's gonna be born it's why it's been all of that time back there with Adam you remember that that Adam God gave out of eternal life in his soul and that was his example son was Adam Adam never lost his eternal life in his soul but he lost possession of the world and all of the things that related around there he never lost it eternal life the second Adam came the first Adam had imparted eternal life into his soul the second Adam didn't have impartation of eternal life into this so he was the very soul himself the Lord Jesus Christ was Almighty God himself come down in human flesh to dwell with us to here upon earth would never remember then he started on the day of Pentecost right he started his church on the day of Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth eternal life the growth development of the Apostles there is Paul that on the backside of the desert comes out of there preaching adoption same thing Peter was preaching in 2nd Peter the growth development of a child was adoption you born into the family you've your child when you're born which you growth development brings you to superiorities and things of your father to where he can trust you that's the statue of a perfect man all of its a saying to bring it to the position that God can use you and have you as a son of God like Adam was the son of God like Jesus was the son of God like the early church was the son of God coming forth our God in human flesh it was not the spirit that was eaten down in the Dark Ages it was the word the word was what was ate down and the word had to start back in Luther the just shall live by faith then it had to come to Wesley of sanctification that's why we believe in all of those churches out there that they think we don't believe in you think maybe we don't believe in those churches I believe we're anchored on what Martin Luther taught her the just shall live by faith when Luther come out of that Catholic Church I came out because the just shall live by faith I believe in the just shall live by faith John Wesley preached sanctification I believe in that the Pentecost were preached the baptism of the holy goat and speaking in tongues and shout I believe in every bit of that but see then the message of the hour came to restore what was eating away to bring you back to the faith of the Father Peter was telling them sin that listen this is the way you come to work that God wants you to come you add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness until you come back to where we're standing because remember wouldn't it be something wouldn't it be something that's like I said nothing that wouldn't be something for us to say okay now tomorrow twelve o'clock we're gonna meet over Don's garage in and I'm gonna tear a motor apart and put it back together and show y'all how it's done well I think you got enough confidence to know I can get it apart right but I can't put it back together he's gonna take somebody that has experienced diet to put it back together easy to take it apart right well sister-in-law if she could never make a dress she just couldn't do it my brother he learned how to make dresses I remember my brother's a Methodist preacher he'd make up her dresses and things for one because he learned how to do it Peter was standing there sayin listen that today I got born again all of these things were brought in to me too right here and he said now you got born again down here in your faith and you need to grow up where I'm at and I'm trying to tell you how to do it he was the teacher he was the college graduate would it be something to walk into a thing let's see sterling got a 400 on his and what it was and college thing 400 right I mean if I understanding that's the best you can get well you know that's what I got the only problem is they put a decimal in front of my 4 so I had decimal 400 right you understand what I'm trying to say don't put a novice God didn't put a novice to write his word he never took a novice to write his word he used only those who were tutored and trying we'll get to it eventually when he gets over in Galatians he said he gave gifts he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints to the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come to the stature read your Bible you know that's one scripture brother around there using such a perfect man and why I don't know he never talked to that stature of that scripture that was the only scripture that has this word stature in it the stature of the fullness of Christ Peter said we've reached his place I won't try to teach you how to follow me brother branham come along he said Lord should fill me up with these things fill me up Lord with these things that I make teach others apostles prophets you read stature perfectly what do you say that I meet each other it's a possible profit advantage of pastoring these for the perfecting of the Saints the edifying of the body of Christ right he told us what God wanted us to hear Peter is trying to say okay now you just don't jump up brother MOCA had to a great way of come come on musicians well the moment out of West expressing things it was good he said now the way we do it he said we look at tall and said we run over to a ladder and said we just jump up about four wrongs and take off the last brother high all he was coming down one of them and he decided he didn't need to make them last couple of steps he just stepped off the ladder well they he'd done that I've done it a minute I hadn't you but he didn't realize it was a log laying there that his foot hit and he twisted it and he's had a gerbil all his life see Church we need growth development in Christ growth development is the hardest thing to try to talk about I wasn't the one that said it we will get to those thing where the Prophet said that those seven thunders of the revelation contained in the seven seals 327 church age we'll read it this messenger melikhaya for Luke seventeen thirty or revelation to himself he said he'd do two things one turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father to you reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals and it these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn earth back so then you want to be turned back to the faith of the Father the only way you can be turned back to the faith of the father's for the seals to be opening to you I don't need to understand to see you left if you know I don't deep stuff we don't need that we need to dish we need to get more and again that's what I just say it that was what I just say it I said the only way that we can stop being babies is to hear God's Word and let it unfold unto us to help us to grow up in Christ until we come to the stature of the fullness of Christ through the opening of the word through the opening of the seven seals is what your prophet said but it's just like I've said to you I've talked with preachers like seals Daniel seventy weeks we don't need to understand this come find out didn't even have a book come find out a lot of them ministers never even had a book and never read Daniel seventy weeks but they could tell you all about it never read the book I asked you a simple question how many of you have ever sat down and read to see a book I told you I don't want you to raise your hand because it shows up how many of you is really ever just sat down and read a single book we get you know all about it you evidently do because you don't need nobody to treat you if somebody comes along you trying to eat this we don't need these big things feed my sheep we don't need these deep things we just need to know how to get saved Church I'm sorry that my memory is too good but I remember it's either in the questions and answers are in the seventh seal but around us is going with I'm a simple message he said because if you don't you'll work yourself away from it everything that I've ever preached for 50 years from this pulpit Nord in 1971 will be close to 50 there's been justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth all I've ever preached is the new birth marriage and divorce is the new birth attached to a perfect man isn't and where the seals is a new birth Daniel 70 weeks is a new birth what else you want to go to it's all the new birth it's all being born again by the incorruptible Word of God left and again [Music] I am anybody have a name are you sure Maria born again and I'm ready [Music] it's just [Music] a father [Music] one more time [Music] [Applause] [Music] see my father [Music] it's [Music] do you know [Music] see then if you know then the doctor walks up and he says according to our medical records and our machineries and I you got about two minutes to live you might change your thinking along about that time and become concerned about your soul right but what if they come along and say we're gonna do this we're gonna do that doctor told me one time he said I'll take your kneecap off now it's wore out this is the old days when you was Chester with his peg leg straight you didn't bend your knee no more and he said you I'm gonna take it all I said doctor you will never take my kneecap off you don't want he's dead and gone now still got my knees never been sure the word you could just look at the doctor in life they came in and told me said you have remember the gland on the neck you have leukemia they didn't explain because they didn't know at that time their tests was not completed he said but we've got some things to do I said I'll go along with you on everything but I'll never take your chemo I'll never tell you not to do it don't you ever thank brother Dale will tell you I'll never tell you not to do it but if you're not sure you don't know you do what you can do and try to get by and let God take care of it they said well we've got this we got that I said we got this that's what I told the doctor I said you said on that side of the table you doctor them you give them these treatments I said I'm on this night the table I buried your people what I told you turned out to be a great friend I mean the hospital deceives me come running good friend we see I was honest then they come back and they said well you don't have the kind that you'll die from you have the kind that you'll die with I said okay I'll die with it who's worried about it because I wasn't concerned these something inside of me says all is well all is well all settled yeah see if you've got two Goods you don't have to worry about it if you know where you're standing you don't have to worry but if you're worried today whether the next moment might mean death to you I would suggest you find God and talk doing a little make sure cuz only the new birth can say take care of any of our problems we don't have that yes sir exactly don't make no difference all is well can you say that father we thank you for the day and we pray that what we said has been worth it Lord we just try our best to get to the people to understanding of the new birth in the way that you want us to understand we can talk about growth developments all we want to but until we get that sure foundation the faith based in to your word we can't walk up we just stumble around and stay where we're at have your way blessing Lord just be with us be with brother Louise coming back home people waiting them tomorrow and this blessing take care we love you and we thank you in Jesus name [Music] [Applause] [Music] this world [Music]
