TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good to be wanted back y'all could you throw me out yeah but you didn't okay we're going to talk today on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Deanna no all right get my password back here been away too long yeah I know okay so now what we're gonna do I have been studying a couple of things and I think we're still going to try to do and I may do it in a sermon is the five comings of Elijah and some people have asked me to um asked me to do like a mystery Expo so that you can you can um present the message to people or present the gospel to people and then be able to mold it into the message but I'm not it's important over there but um there you go so we're gonna probably do this and then probably just do a sermon on the five comings of Elijah and then uh I'm gonna get Roberto Royal and see if he can send me the uh the whole mystery Expo part that we did over in uh in Palau and actually he sent me an email uh two days ago they just returned back from over there he baptized three more denominational people in the name of Lord Jesus Christ that were in the meeting so three of the 15's been baptized and they're going back to go into the churches to start preaching the message so wow that's wonderful he said he would love for me to be over there with him I'd like to win but um I just got back so I'll just leave it to them let them do it but what we're going to do is today just kind of do an overview on a subject of the three sons names all right now we're going to read what brother round says and then we'll turn it off now I'm just gonna give you a sketch of what we're going to do and then we're going to really Break It Down Like Sunday school okay but brother Brown says here on the unveiling of God said he came in three names three sons names now who is this who's the hate Christ comes in three nights all right and he came in the name of the son of man the son of David and the Son of God three sons names all right he come first and the son of man because he was the prophet now he's talking about Jesus coming to Earth because we're going to see though that the Son of God was before the foundation of the world all right but why it's not a man because he was a prophet now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel in the prophets the son of man because it says in Ezekiel prophesies on a man okay son of man wants to see us now Jesus never referred to himself as a Son of God remember he asked Peter he said Peter who do who do the man say I the son of man I am not the Son of God Peter did not answer his question the way he asked it okay and that stumps a lot of people but study it he said who the man say I the son of man now he said you're the Christ the son of the Living God bless the son of God but that was the son of God Revelation that Jesus Built the church on because he said Peter Flesh and Blood had revealed it to you but my Father which in heaven and I'll build my church on that Revelation well down through seven Church ages it was the son of God Revelation not the son of man Revelation the Son of God Revelation so he told people told Peter he said I'm gonna build my church on that but we see the other scriptures that come in that that the Bible says that the revelation of the son of man would have to come back in the end time and I know people get that's why I want to break it down slowly try to slowly break it down to where we see remember it's all one true and living God it's all the spirit of God the son of man is God the son of God's God and the son of David is God all right but you say well what's important the manifestation is very important because the Son of God Revelation as I was telling you before the Son of God Revelation is what the church ages had they don't have this this is the son of man Revelation right here this Capstone right here is the this is Jesus Christ The Headstone he was the son of man right right all right so we got the Son of God Revelation well hey these people are dead in the ground it takes the son of man Revelation for a body change that's what I said you can have all these virtues and still die and go by the grave right right amen it takes the son of man revelation in the end time yes yes and not one man but a group of people right to make it because that's why brother around him he had a revelation of the son of man but he was one man he was the first one to come to that but he couldn't be the only one to take a Rapture they had to be all of us that had to be there to take a Rapture so he came to what point us to Christ so we see now that what Jesus never referred himself to the Son of God he referred himself the son of man because the scriptures cannot be broken there can be nothing broken in the scripture this is my whole point right here one word got us out of the garden right one word got us out of the Garden of Eden not all right right so if we're one word off you think we're going to get back I'm talking about one word that's what I was trying to tell the people if you watch that down in Mobile that you have to get people to see well if whatever you think whatever I think if it's close we'll put it together no that's not no that's right that's not what Jesus said right be therefore perfect one word now if you notice in the beginning one word page one in the Bible Genesis 1 we find out that the whole all the sickness all the sorrow all heartaches and everything that ever happens to human beings came because one person disbelieved one word caused all this that's the first of the Bible and the last of the Bible Revelation 22 the same God said whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it see it must be word by word just the way it is all right then you he went on with the sermon but let's go to this is broken sister now let's read the same thing I want to read you what he says watch he makes three comings he coming three son's name he come in a trinity father son Holy Ghost see all of it the same Christ the same God all the time now we know he come to bring three works of Grace justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost everything in God is completed in threes but now remember see also like brother now was talking about he comes first to redeem his bride he had to come here to redeem us he comes a second time to pick her up right and he comes the third time with us together all right all right so what he done he come down as son of man to redeem his bride he comes the second time which is truly the subtle man in the end time but it is those that were died under the son of God right yeah we'll understand it later on and then he comes what bride king and queen now where we're gonna where are we going to be we're gonna be in the Millennium as king and queen so he's son of David to them not to us he's our husband right he's not he's not the son of David to us right right the son of David we'll break it down the son of David was promised in the Old Testament that David's son which Jesus was not David's physical son right right but by spiritual revelation God said I think so much of David well that's pretty tough I thank so much of David a murderer right whoremonger and whatever else he was liar I thought so I think I think so much of David until my son's gonna set on the throne in the Millennium ruling the 12 tribes of Israel well what's going to happen we're going to be there with them all right but now look but when he comes this time hardly none but those who are ready will know when he comes there'll be just an absence of people graves are not going to open right we're not going to drive by one day and see the dirt call back off of the graves no they're going to come right up out of that Grave Just Like Jesus walked through the wall they're going to reach down there that this everything's going to pick up that body it's going to be changed they're going to walk right out so and then what changing the moment 20 of an eye but remember here's a couple of keys that we're gonna that we're going to talk about the son of man is the only one that took a body change the Son of God doesn't need a body chain that's right okay that's why the son of man Revelation had to come back in the end time to change somebody's body okay Jesus as the son of man what son of man is God in human flesh all right he had to come back on in human flesh Son of God don't need a body change son of God's perfect the Son of God is that Holy Ghost that you have in you that's perfect never sinned a day in his life right that's right right the son of man is the one that had to come the end time to teach us how to change a body so it is important that we have the son of man because everybody well I say this most people in the message think we're under the son of man of Revelation just because we're in the end time well yeah they might be under the Son of God Son of Man Revelation but do they have a revelation that's not a man because we're not going to take a body change just because we know that this was a son of man revelation right right not gonna happen this ain't an automatic process right if it was it'd be so easy and the rest of these would have already took it so it comes down to an end time to a point where it's going to be very narrow this day the scripture is fulfilled he come in three names he come his son of man which was prophet and that's what he did he proved his ministry by being a prophet but we all know that every one of us knows that he never said he was the son of God right okay but yet Peter said Thou Art the crisis on the Living God we'll we'll get into that I just want to wet your appetite and let you start maybe look up Son of God look up son of man look up the things and what the prophet of God said about about this it make it easier for me to to uh to present it if you know a little bit about it every one of us knows it he never said he was the son of God he said he was the son of man now today he's the son of God right today he's the son of God he returned back and now he's in the form of the Holy Ghost the Unseen person but yet God the Son of God and the Millennium he sits upon his father's Throne which he'll be son of David he revealed reveals himself first the son of man of prophet this age through the church Jesus Son of Man or Son of God and in the other age some David Three Sons now watch he continues on though but you notice here he said at the ending of the church age it had gotten such a mess till he would be revealed again as son of man in the days of life so it was a days a lot so is it in the days of the son of man as it wasn't Jason Noah so he's the son of man so what it's a promise of bringing the son of man back when those days are being fulfilled all right that's not a man when the son of man is being revealed he's quoting scripture right here how appropriate was that mix up yesterday and I hope you don't miss it we have we have had the revelation of the son of God all right actually that had that come up through denominational Martin Luther was the with the Catholic preaching the Trinity yet he had the Son of God Revelation for his time the Holy Ghost is the Son of God that's right okay Martin Luther's Holy Ghost was no different than yours right that's right it's just it didn't feed on the same word you're right Revelation feed zone or your son of God feed them we're gonna back up and go through it I'm just kind of letting you know what we're gonna do for the next few weeks is speak on these three sons name we've had the revelation of the Son of God but the last promise that Abraham had before the son was made or brought into existence the one that he had been promised now remember Abraham had a promised son all right and and God led him through his journey Son of God led him through his journey right there was nobody in human flesh that had the Son of God in them in the Old Testament right but what did he mean when he comes to a time he meets God in human flesh a pre-figure of the son of man Revelation same way with me and you me and you as the sons of Abraham in our journey we're going to meet not just the Son of God but down here in the end time we're going to meet that same man that's right but it's not going to be one man anymore it's going to be in a many-membered body yes right but remember Melchizedek was a form but he was not the son of man that come to die for you because that flesh was spoken into existence spoken out of this hey the son of man had to come just like me and you except it was virgin birth all right he had to come through the womb he had to grow up as a baby and grow all the way up Melchizedek didn't have to do that he was just God stepped into a human flesh spoke to Abraham gave him a sign and then left all right so God manifests himself there saw them as a prophet being a man and flesh God Elohim as I heard someone speak it a while ago which was the godhead Bible that was in him he was a fullness Elohim is the fullness of the godhead bodily notice there when lot saw when Abraham saw him coming he said my Lord there was three of them and down inside him lot saw two and said my Lord lack of Revelation okay but now remember lot was called out right remember lots of time for the foolish virgin right so he's not some scumbag that we think about he no he made it that's right he's gonna be in heaven right right I mean he made it he he was down there right in the middle of all that junk and it backs his righteous Soul the Bible said but there was lack of Revelation to get out of there amen so when the two went down to Sodom which was Billy Graham Oral Roberts not the person Billy Graham or Roberts but the anointing all right everybody okay with that right they didn't look I've heard preachers preach that they look like Billy Roberts I mean Billy Grandma Roberts please brother random didn't look like the first Elijah but he had the spirit of life okay right because you're looking at a soul here a soul is the real you that's what you look like now look when Abraham met Melchizedek that man looked like Jesus Christ yeah because that was God Almighty and at the often he had to look what that flesh looked like right it couldn't look different right right because remember when brother Brown said Jesus went down to Hell to pick up the Old Testament Saints right right knocked on the door he said the first one open door was Abraham Abraham we'll read it Abraham said Sarah there's the man that we ate calf and great melt with under the tree who was it it was Jesus Christ in theophany form same man same man huh that the often he did not eat the body he was in ate okay everybody okay with that because remember theophany brother Brown said he went over across the current time he said we don't eat over here they told him we don't eat but now what are they doing they're trying to get back here so they can't eat so Melchizedek as a theophany couldn't eat but Melchizedek inhuman flesh could eat okay so Elohim is the fullness of the godhead and bodily we noticed there when lot saw when Abraham saw him he said my Lord there was three of them down in Sodom a lot saw too and said my Lord's lack of Revelation and that's what happened out there the church ages it's been a lack of Revelation so notice what taken place here when he comes up how he made himself known and then he continued his own he talked about hey let's read one more could we not could I not say this if I had just been on my toes see the brother prophesied when he said to me what he did this day watch what he did right after the reading of that scripture in the days when the son of man not a man not a human being the son of man will reveal himself among his people again this day this promise remember you remember what happened when he preached this day the scriptures fulfilled right when the priest gave him the Bible and he read the scroll right this day the scripture of this hour that we're now living is fulfilled before our very eyes he turned me into the congregation 10 or 12 whatever people is out there unknown he did the very same thing he did at Sodom this day has this scripture been made manifest before you it's been made True before you what's he do what's he saying the underlying meaning is he's telling you the son of man of Revelation is here that's what he's saying this day this scripture is fulfilled the son of man Revelation is right here now the last one Jesus said in Saint Mark he said in that day the son of man will be revealed now remember not Son of God that's right actually the Son of God is the revealer of the word because it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the revealer of the word what's inside of you is the Son of God what was inside of Jesus was the son of God but it was the son of God in human flesh the fullness of the godhead Bible ink where did that flesh come from they come from God that's right so if it came from God it was God's flesh amen absolutely that was God's pleasure what do you think he got it from right right it was his flesh now if he created the egg and created the sperm that's right they came from God it was God okay yeah it came from him I mean he didn't go get a piece of dirt somewhere you know he made an egg and he made a sperm now remember not Son of God so he's telling you not Son of God and the latest son of man will be revealed God coming three sons names son of man Son of God Son of David when he was on Earth he came as a son of man he was a prophet son of man is a prophet my brother Brown said we're a little Messiahs or we're little Pro we're prophets right the eagle anointing just didn't come to brother Branham and then leave when he left we're all in that eagle anointing so we all are prophets all right now not the office of a prophet right you understand there's Apostle prophets pastors teachers in evangelists that's a gift an office that a man can work in but we all have the gift of of of knowing that we can go up and see as far this way or this way as this way is this way we can do that because brother around him was the one to first come to maturity and if he give us the word then what we're supposed to do is what take the word do the same thing he did amen he was a prophet son of man as a prophet Jehovah himself called the prophets Jeremiah then son of man what saith thou Jesus come because he had to come according to the scripture as son of man Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet lock and unto me and he had to be a prophet son of man but after his death burial and Resurrection now he has been Son of God the supernatural the Holy Ghost God's flesh is not on the Earth his literal flesh right right God's literal flesh is not on the earth he ascended right but he gave the commission back that in the day when the son of mans to be revealed so he must have left enough Revelation for us to come back to God in human flesh glad when he went away he said I go to the father and that makes it sound like he went back to Spirit form where he went with somebody yeah but that means the holy spirit that came back into the Church of the spirit that's right we'll get into that because we're going to break it down because remember now brother remember I'm done covered here but he does another quote brother Brown says he came first to the son of man now he's talking about Jesus right everybody got that he's talking about Jesus Christ 2000 years ago but the Son of God in Revelation we're going to take it all the way back to the beginning to the creation okay we're going all the way back so he was the son of God first I don't know if you can say that Eternal being a first and a second he always was right I mean he always was a son of man that's why he could make him a flesh because it was always there where he could make him a place he was a Creator though Satan can't create he's the only one who can create so he had the son of man of Revelation you think he's the one that needs all this we're the ones that need all this that's right we're taking a God that you can't even understand he was before everything and he knew your thought before the foundation of the world but in Pakistan he knew that guy stop before the foundation of the world how are you gonna explain that okay how are you gonna explain it but what he done is he said okay I'm going to explain this to my kids I'm going to come here I'm going to come here I'm going to come here and I'm going to come here and they're going to be able to understand just enough to get them to where I am right all right isn't that right because he wants to be United with us it's wonderful to know that you're married like sister June and I it was wonderful to know that we're married but after about second week of being in the Philippines away from her I wanted to be close the same way with God he wants to be close to us he can't do it right without me and you that's right coming to a place that's right he cannot come to this earth he is barred by the scripture until the son of man be revealed he can't come down and pick us up and actually remember he comes down so far and we meet him in the air right his feet never touches this Earth until the Millennium until everything's done all of his the bride and the Grooms has been to the wedding supper and we come back down here together in glorified bodies that's the only way he can come back so he's waiting that's what brother Brown said God's waiting on you and I right adoption time to where God can pour in his fullness what right here is adoption this is not this is adoption right here all right and the one that takes the body change will have to come to adoption because he can't change you down here or he would already change them and come through the Son of God Revelations everybody understand that if you don't then we'll explain it that's what we're going to do we're going to break it down but we're going to start back before time amen brother Brown I'm gonna talk about the Son of God the logos and theophany and come down what's he doing he's laying a plan brother brother Branham literally picked up the very Mind Of God but now remember the only way you and I can understand it is to pick up the same thing that's right we must pick up the same mind of God that he did because Paul didn't say you need to have a mind to Christ and I don't that's right we all need to have the mind of Christ what happened was brother Brown was the ver was a I always like to say he was a big Cube God could pour all that down in that big tube and bring it to the people we got little old Mini cubes about this big around and sometimes just stop stopped up with stuff that's right but you know what if you can get that if you can get that Revelation through that little tube it's just the same as the big tube you just got to do a lot more pushing you know you got to push it down through that Cube and that's what God's doing but he promised he's the son of God now Supernatural the Holy Ghost but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form three of them two angels and God himself that was God the Bible said it was now he came down and he manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent that right congregation says amen now remember this is 1965. um in April so he's coming to the end of his ministry at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself because remember the son of man Jesus Christ cannot be on this Earth in that same body he come to the Son of God Revelation to present it to the people but what did what did Brother Brown say he's been bound by the door of Creeds and dogmas God man has shut the door right to not let God work like he wanted to work that's right but right here at the end time there's gonna be a group of people that's going to work exactly the same Ministry that Jesus had is the same Ministry we're supposed to have now was Jesus wrong no so so what's wrong with us if we got 13 000 different denominations just in the message what's what's wrong there's something wrong with that perfect ministry of Jesus Christ now it's brought over in the end time and it's supposed to be what brother Brown said not even one word off right and here we are we got this one this one and this one this one and this one got this idea and this one's got the idea this one's got this revelation somebody has got to have that same revelation let me be honest with you if you have a revelation that's contrary to the prophet's message or contrary to the Bible you can't have a son of man Revelation right amen now you can be blinded and be and be a son of God amen but you can't make it to the change okay okay because you've got you've got that one word off right Eve was one word off she died you one word off you die that's why there won't be many people stand at the body change because they're you know what they're going to be they're going to be Jesus Christ himself in Bride form standing on the Earth now you and I are that now but somewhere we must be one word off because we're still here amen that's just the way I say it right okay let's hurry the church comes through justification through the Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of holy ghost or the Pentecostal go right on into the perfection of the son of man because remember the Son of God Revelation is perfect but it's not complete because God's always wanted to live in human flesh God's always wanted us to live in human flesh why that's what we're going to end up in yeah all right we're going to end up in human flesh right we're gonna live on this Earth in the glorified body with that one word taken care of man that's what we got to come to all right into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same South person God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will vote they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at because remember and I brought this out in the Philippines and they really enjoyed it because it and it's something very simple but it's very profound Eve was not June and I are one if we're truly one buy the new birth and by our Union as husband and wife if we're truly one Christians then brother Brown said we're one we're one in Christ but we're not literally one right right she come from a set of parents I came from a set of parents but Eve was literally Adam in another form literally when he looked at her he said that's my flesh when he said Flesh of My Flesh and Bone my bone it wasn't a type she was literally here's flesh made manifest in another form right amen you said well now we can't yeah we can we we better get back to that that's right to where my flesh and because what the Bible says we'll have a body unto his glory like unto his glorious body amen so he's working through this flesh he's got to the Son of God inside of you is already perfect already sitting in Heavenly places yes basically you're already raptured remember the Rapture started when you got born again right amen yes the Son of God Revelation but he's got to work out with this guy that's right if not we'll read it later on if not then we're gonna have to go back to that scripture that says we plant them in corruption and to raise him an incorruption we plant we literally go plant people out here in the soil yeah that's right right we literally plant them that's what Paul said we plant them in corruption but we raise them in incorruption right so they're going to raise that body like those people on those pictures in there that about you're never going to see Robert Tatum walking around with his fingers all messed up anymore right right amen that's done and gone that's finished his time's over on the Earth but when he comes out of that that's right when that body comes back together he'll be just as whole as he was when he was 20 years old that's right man amen but now look that's not a fairy tale because somebody is going to stand here and not have to be planted amen that's right and Corruption is going to meet its Master right here that's right not having because remember what was cursed Adam wasn't cursed because he was the son of who God right right he wasn't cursed the Earth was cursed that's why when we put them in the ground yeah there's a crush there that holds because that is corruption amen how we dying we're dying because of what we're eating out of the Earth because man has put so much junk and pollution in here that's what the curse is it's not God just cursed the Earth and said you're cursed he cursed the Earth by the people doing what they're doing on the earth nobody understand that say amen amen because that's what's happening to me and you were eating the same food brother Ryan said I eat the same food I ate when I was a little kid and I got stronger and bigger he said I ate the same food now I get weaker and weaker right right that's exactly right what's happening it's something in that soil that's true they can't come up and change you because it's been cursed right see that's why this Earth is cursed you look at you're looking at the curse everybody's looking at the curse we've been together a long time some of us where you're looking at the you know no you're not looking at the curse you're looking at the effects of the curse that's right we're not cursed people we're Sons and Daughters of God we're not cursed people right all right but we see the effects of the curse well the effects of the curse is Robert Tatum and all them that are in the grave that's the effects of the curse they they were not able to come to a revelation to change our bodies some of us may have to do the same thing but somebody is going to have to come to that look what he says right here now we see now what I'm saying is Eve and Adam were literally one person yes yes now look brother Brandon said if you got two people one's a devil and one's God that's right so we're not a second person of God right exactly we've got to understand that we are God made manifest in another form called the bride called Sons and Daughters of God the children of God but we're not different that's not what he said right here till they will both be the same when God walked down and looked at Adam and Eve like brother Brown said in one us he said if you'd have stood back and looked you would have seen three people God standing there Adam standing there and he's standing there he said but when God looked at him they were all one amen right when God said let us make man our own image he wasn't looking sure he saw all the millions of people that would be his bride but he was looking at one thing one bribe because there's your type when Adam came out of Eve I mean Eve came out Adam there was the title yeah he was literally born of his bone and flesh of his flesh You and I by the transforming power of God is coming back to that yeah that's right he said well it's impossible nothing's impossible with God no he gave you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost guides you in all truth don't hold to them traditions and Creeds they were all right in their day see son of God's revelation but the flower has bloomed to a blossomed now it's sea time Jesus Promised these things now when we see God excuse me make his promises live before us and see that it's in us and his spirit is living in us that is the only way of worship he's talking about communion same thing that's the only way of worship only place to worship the only true way you can worship yeah for there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus right God made the promise Jesus said the things that I do you'll do also now Jesus didn't do things out of hand so we should be coming to the place and not doing things out of him you understand out of line that's what this is for right it's what we've been talking about that for the past year the things I do you'll do also and what he would do and and what he would do in the last day how it came through this age neither light nor day would be like a darkened time but said that in the evening time it shall be live so study that this week just look up some quotes if you wish on the Sun God and the son of man but we're going to start with the son of God and show the development coming down where God's condescending down to the right here where we're sitting today it may take a while but we got time until time's over so the Lord bless you study that we're going to we'll be speaking on the three son's name first one next time Son of God revelation
