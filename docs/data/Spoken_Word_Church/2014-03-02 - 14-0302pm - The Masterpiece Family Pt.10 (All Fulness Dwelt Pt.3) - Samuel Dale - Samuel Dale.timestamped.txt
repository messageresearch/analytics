[19:44] uh you know we're now don't get excited
[19:47] we're not going to have the baby
[19:48] dedication
[19:50] but we want them to bring the baby up
[19:54] it won't be the dedication that's going
[19:56] to be when the whole family comes you
[19:57] know and they're going to do all that
[19:58] but if brother and sister Anderson would
[20:01] bring the the baby up because
[20:04] you know this is a miracle
[20:07] because there's two things wrong first
[20:10] was a problem in his sperm count
[20:14] was nothing
[20:15] you know it was nothing period all right
[20:18] and it's a miracle all right but then
[20:21] she had a growth
[20:24] in her female things and it was
[20:28] concerned about that
[20:29] so
[20:30] you know you say well there's nothing
[20:33] going on
[20:35] well
[20:36] you know
[20:37] here is a proof that there's something
[20:40] going on because the Church of praying
[20:45] and we just thank God for a little
[20:47] miracle baby
[20:49] you know that they were not supposed to
[20:51] have
[20:52] but they were told
[20:54] they were going to have it and it did
[20:57] and we believe it see we're not going to
[20:58] dedicate it because that'll be later but
[21:00] we just wanted it to be there to show
[21:02] that there is a God still living that
[21:05] can take care of your needs if you ask
[21:07] him
[21:08] and we have not because we ask not so
[21:11] we'll do the dedication later but we
[21:14] just wanted that done because see you
[21:15] say well there's nothing going on
[21:17] well
[21:18] we've had three accounts of the Dead
[21:21] raised
[21:23] how many miracles do we need for
[21:26] somebody to believe
[21:27] you know how many things do we need
[21:29] that's just right here in this little
[21:30] group it's not around the world uh that
[21:34] you know is is proven uh you know we've
[21:37] had all kinds of things
[21:39] to happen right right in here is one of
[21:41] the Miracles the brother that was
[21:43] singing the song dire with the
[21:45] soundtrack
[21:46] he was underwater for over five minutes
[21:49] possibly 10 to 15 minutes
[21:52] in the water
[21:54] you know supposed to not lift
[21:57] but yet God brought him out I think he
[21:59] sounds pretty good for a man been under
[22:01] the water
[22:04] but you see God is real okay so we'll
[22:06] dedicate her later all right we won't do
[22:09] it today okay if I get a hold of her
[22:12] we'll you'll never get her back
[22:14] but uh because give her about six or
[22:17] eight months I'll be getting her because
[22:19] that's I love him little babies
[22:21] you know they're wonderful but that's
[22:23] just you know the Miracles and things
[22:26] that we can say well God has done this
[22:28] God has done that so we believe it I
[22:31] believe in a miracle working God don't
[22:33] you amen father we thank you for this
[22:36] day and for the hour that we've had
[22:38] thank you for you because without you
[22:41] there's nothing in any of us and we're
[22:43] not trying to brag on anything other
[22:45] than speak what is true of you because
[22:48] we know what the doctors have said and
[22:50] we just we don't depend on them we
[22:52] depend on what you say when we believe
[22:54] in the doctors we thank you we're glad
[22:56] to have them we're glad to have all the
[22:58] things of them of the materialistic
[23:01] ideas of the world and things we don't
[23:03] throw it away we believe in it and we
[23:05] thank you Lord but we know who God is
[23:08] and what he's doing so now we pray that
[23:11] you would just come Among Us Lord in a
[23:13] mighty way today and open your word unto
[23:16] us because that's what we've desired to
[23:18] do and then you said in your word that
[23:19] you sent your word and healed us and
[23:21] delivered us from destruction so we
[23:23] believe that you will take care of us we
[23:26] thank you for all things we love you and
[23:28] we just commit everything into your
[23:30] hands in Jesus name amen
[23:34] all righty Colossians
[23:37] 1 verse 15.
[23:43] who is the image of the invisible God
[23:45] the firstborn of ever creature
[23:47] for by him were all things created that
[23:50] were that are in heaven and that are in
[23:52] Earth
[23:53] visible and invisible whether they be
[23:55] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[23:58] or Powers all things were created by Him
[24:00] and for him and he is before all things
[24:03] we know now who this is right
[24:05] who the Lord Jesus Christ the one true
[24:07] and living God
[24:09] and he is before all things and by him
[24:11] all things consists
[24:13] and he is the head of the body of the
[24:15] church who's the beginning the firstborn
[24:17] from the dead that in all things he
[24:18] might have the preeminence or it pleased
[24:21] him for it pleased the father that in
[24:24] him should all fullness dwell okay then
[24:27] we look at verse 9 of the second chapter
[24:31] for him in him dwelleth all the fullness
[24:33] of the godhead bodily
[24:36] and ye are complete in him which is the
[24:40] head of all principality and power you
[24:42] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[24:46] to the reading of the word
[24:49] you see church I love to brag about him
[24:52] and what he's done don't you I really
[24:55] love it because it's true
[24:58] I've been a part of it I've been healed
[25:00] I've been delivered I've been many many
[25:03] things
[25:04] you know
[25:05] right and we could stand all afternoon
[25:07] and talk about it
[25:08] because I have the medical records to
[25:11] show that my blood type has totally been
[25:13] changed
[25:14] from a positive to a negative
[25:18] and just a wonderful thing amen
[25:20] appreciate little Abby coming and
[25:23] playing that her first little Overture I
[25:26] guess you call it or whatever that would
[25:28] be but we appreciate that it was great
[25:31] amen
[25:32] all right let's get back in to try not
[25:34] to back up too much on this morning
[25:37] but let's think about it
[25:40] what is in the Bible that speaks of God
[25:45] is actually speaking of you and I
[25:47] because we are the ones of mankind all
[25:51] the way down through and we've made
[25:52] ourselves very very clear
[25:55] of what we're talking about I think that
[25:59] to talk about the bride be in the
[26:01] fullness of the godhead bodily
[26:03] shouldn't be any problem because it's
[26:06] what he has made us
[26:09] is what he's made us so it's his choice
[26:12] now I can't have it if he's done it you
[26:16] know I mean I'm the 13th kid of a family
[26:19] that was not supposed to I wasn't
[26:21] supposed to be here because I'm the 13th
[26:24] and my dad was 45 before him and my Mom
[26:27] married that would be enough Miracle you
[26:30] know I mean you calculate
[26:32] the last one out of 13 and he wouldn't
[26:35] they didn't get married at least 45 and
[26:38] uh so I finished up the things I reckon
[26:41] of all and uh but that's a miracle
[26:44] you know as many things we can talk
[26:47] about in life
[26:48] and see that God is real
[26:51] but see God is pointing back towards you
[26:54] and I he's always done that Paul said
[26:57] it's not I his brother dick was was
[26:59] talking about a while ago it's not I
[27:01] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[27:04] all right see then Paul said follow me
[27:06] as I follow Christ
[27:09] all right that's the way I follow
[27:11] brother Branham as he followed Christ
[27:13] now where he was wrong on the White
[27:15] Horse Rider you know in the things that
[27:18] coming down through there well we can't
[27:20] follow that now he admitted he was wrong
[27:23] and God corrected him because of the
[27:25] opening of the word so then he was a
[27:27] human being he was not God as I was
[27:30] saying this morning we don't believe in
[27:32] him being infallible but we believe the
[27:34] message he brought amen
[27:36] was invaluable because as ministers
[27:40] we're not infallible
[27:42] but we are trying to bring you what we
[27:45] see at least that's what I try to do of
[27:48] what he's doing and this is no new
[27:50] message to me I've been preaching this
[27:51] for 40 something years to you
[27:54] about God in the fullness and started in
[27:57] 69 in Athens Georgia preaching about the
[28:00] bride being the son of man and we won't
[28:03] get to that today because it's way on
[28:05] down but you know I believe it I believe
[28:08] in a living God
[28:10] why would you serve a dead God
[28:13] come on I just get me a totem pole or
[28:16] give me a little something carried
[28:17] around my pocket and then I can take it
[28:18] out and rub it every once in a while you
[28:20] know
[28:21] you know I said boy my God he's real
[28:22] look at him you know
[28:24] see and and I'm not throwing off on
[28:26] anybody I'm just honest
[28:29] I want something real
[28:32] you know I I don't like uh fake things I
[28:36] don't like you know things that you have
[28:38] to prop up
[28:39] and us talking about the dead Rays three
[28:41] times we know we don't have to prop that
[28:43] up
[28:45] it's on record it's been there for years
[28:48] it's been on record here for 40
[28:50] something years that my blood type was
[28:52] changed from
[28:54] a positive day negative by their own
[28:57] doctors that took the test I showed as
[28:59] it would that's not bragging that's just
[29:01] bragging on God
[29:04] because I believe in the Living God
[29:06] why serve a dead God why serve some God
[29:09] that can't help you
[29:11] you know like I said I'd just soon have
[29:13] a totem pole
[29:15] but I believe in the reality of a living
[29:17] God
[29:20] and I believe he'll talk to you if
[29:22] you'll talk to him and believe it
[29:24] you know you said well I know I can't
[29:26] talk to me audibly well I don't say they
[29:28] can't do that
[29:30] but he can sure speak inwardly
[29:32] I mean we have proof in the Bible that
[29:34] Prophet I said you know it was a we're
[29:36] still small voice inside of him see that
[29:40] where he was speaking well he can speak
[29:42] to you and I if he desires to
[29:45] but remember what we're trying to say
[29:47] now the point is we're in the end time
[29:51] and we are in the the Bible says the end
[29:54] of all things has come upon us all right
[29:57] so then in being that then we're down
[30:00] here to make manifest
[30:04] the word and things for the hour that
[30:07] we're living all right now in that then
[30:10] we're we're not looking at just going to
[30:12] church and being good and and you know
[30:14] and all like that and trying to to uh do
[30:17] those things we are trying to
[30:21] be what he wants us to be
[30:24] and I'm happy about that I enjoy it
[30:26] myself because I really love to just I
[30:29] love to do things of the world and
[30:31] hunting and fishing and things but then
[30:33] I always do this love to sit around talk
[30:35] about the word
[30:37] the college that's just part of me all
[30:39] right
[30:40] but now think about it
[30:43] if he says we are something
[30:49] you know we we say all things are
[30:51] possible to God
[30:53] well that's why I believe that but you
[30:55] know he said in his word all things were
[30:57] possible to them that believed
[31:00] well I mean why can't we believe it why
[31:04] is there any point of not believing it I
[31:06] would be an unbeliever
[31:08] that's what I was telling I thought it
[31:11] was Zach the other day about when I went
[31:12] to the doctor and I was telling the
[31:14] doctor about my blood pressure and how
[31:16] that it had been running 190 200 over
[31:19] 110 and they've been keeping records of
[31:21] it at General Motors for quite a while
[31:23] so I went to the doctor and they kept
[31:25] telling you need to go I said well I got
[31:26] a physical coming up and you know I came
[31:29] to church and we prayed and Monday I
[31:31] went to the doctor and
[31:33] I was still expecting it to be high too
[31:35] because it'd been high for quite a while
[31:37] and she said this nurse said my water
[31:39] blood pressure well I was thinking 190
[31:43] maybe over over 200 or something over
[31:45] 110 and uh you know I said oh it's that
[31:50] high huh
[31:51] she said no it's 120 over 80.
[31:55] I said would you believe
[31:58] that it's been running close to 200 over
[32:01] 100 at least
[32:04] and she said no so when the doctor got
[32:07] through you know you go through you can
[32:09] go back and sit down and talk with him
[32:11] he said your blood pressure is in good
[32:12] shape Sam said that's good really good
[32:14] for your age
[32:16] I asked him I said well would you
[32:18] believe it's been running
[32:20] close to 200 over 110.
[32:23] and I've got the things laying here you
[32:25] know what he looked at he says no
[32:28] what
[32:30] well I'm not against him I'm just going
[32:32] out and tell my wife I said you want me
[32:33] to go to the doctor you're going to get
[32:35] me another one
[32:36] I'm not going back to him that's not
[32:38] going to believe
[32:39] because I had to prove to show him
[32:42] well he had some philosophy I guess to
[32:45] figure it all out but that's all right I
[32:48] just believe in a living God and I
[32:49] believe that God is trying to reveal
[32:51] himself in you and I
[32:53] all right
[32:55] he must first reveal himself to us
[32:58] that's the whole catch of the thing is
[33:01] he reveals himself to us all right then
[33:04] he reveals himself in US
[33:06] well I now we don't see him in us first
[33:08] either we see him in Jesus Christ
[33:12] amen
[33:13] all right we see God back there all
[33:16] right but now if the Bible is right you
[33:19] know and we believe it is that Hebrews
[33:21] 13 8 said he's the same yesterday
[33:23] yesterday today and forever well then
[33:26] why can't we say okay he is the same
[33:29] today because he said he was
[33:31] all right it's either that way we're
[33:34] we're depending upon him to make
[33:37] manifest what he promised
[33:40] all right so we've been through the corn
[33:43] of wheat the things of the Masterpiece
[33:45] and things that we've been studying on
[33:47] and we've been through those things to
[33:49] show that it's to come back into to the
[33:52] original grain in the end time the
[33:54] original word that went into the ground
[33:55] has to come back that's why the prophet
[33:57] had to come he had to come to work not
[34:00] that it would rewrite the Bible we don't
[34:02] believe that you'd be getting into junk
[34:04] to try to rewrite the scriptures
[34:07] me he didn't come to rewrite him he come
[34:09] to tell us this what it is
[34:11] he come to tell us this is what he says
[34:13] and that's what we ought to believe you
[34:15] know
[34:15] all right then that way we can we can
[34:18] depend on him
[34:19] all right but then if he says I'm
[34:22] something why can't I say them something
[34:27] you know right you know God don't see
[34:29] you and I because if he's seen us see
[34:31] there's no little there's no no great
[34:33] big sin for this one and a little bitty
[34:36] one for this one
[34:38] you know
[34:40] I mean seeing his sins
[34:42] if there's any sitting there that's a
[34:44] problem
[34:45] all right but there's no big and little
[34:47] it's not well I've I've been good all of
[34:49] my life but you you've been bad no
[34:53] all born in sin safer than iniquity it's
[34:56] possible or mother's wound and we're
[34:57] Liars to start with
[34:59] and look down at the little baby there
[35:00] and you know it don't sound good but you
[35:03] know what I look down there and I don't
[35:04] mean it wrong when I look down there and
[35:06] say when that little baby gets about two
[35:07] years old it's gonna lie
[35:09] mama don't lie daddy don't lie they
[35:12] don't teach you to lie it's raised in
[35:14] church everything but you know what the
[35:17] little baby you say
[35:18] you got a cookie
[35:22] dude you got cookie all over his face
[35:24] and you got one in each hand hiding
[35:26] behind him but you don't have no cookie
[35:27] well who taught him to lie
[35:31] right
[35:32] is to inherit nature of the world that
[35:35] we live in
[35:36] that's why the psalmist starts quoting
[35:38] him there about born in sin saving
[35:40] iniquity that's the psalmist David he
[35:42] kind of you kind of things are going on
[35:44] he had a thousand wives and had over 100
[35:47] kids born in one year so I'm for sure he
[35:49] knows a little bit about kids being born
[35:51] you know and at least he was around
[35:53] sometime during all that time but now
[35:56] listen
[35:58] see the entire body of Christ
[36:01] is down through seven Church ages it
[36:04] takes to hold agency we would look at
[36:06] the pyramid and the things you know and
[36:09] we would see through the the seven
[36:10] Church ages in the Book of Revelations
[36:13] and it takes all of that to bring forth
[36:15] what I'm talking about
[36:17] it's not just nothing was going on but
[36:19] in the end time the great things is
[36:21] happening no it's been God down through
[36:24] each age and time
[36:27] that's why we believe in what the method
[36:30] the Baptist taught to Methodist taught
[36:31] the Presbyterian talk the Pentecostal
[36:33] talk the truth the taught
[36:36] right we believe that that's fine we
[36:38] accept that
[36:39] because it's Truth All right but now
[36:42] watch
[36:44] it won't do any good I want this thought
[36:46] before we start
[36:48] it won't do any good for us to just talk
[36:52] about something
[36:55] but if we can believe it
[36:58] then God Can Make It
[37:01] come alive
[37:02] if we can believe it but if we don't
[37:05] believe it then you know it's not for us
[37:09] there's people that you cannot get them
[37:11] in no way to believe about God and and
[37:13] things
[37:15] why because that they're just the way
[37:18] their mind is set for some reason they
[37:20] don't believe all right well there's no
[37:23] need to be nothing about it you know
[37:25] go on forget it
[37:27] I just I want to be me and be happy
[37:31] about it
[37:32] but we ended up now quoting from the
[37:35] prophet that we believe God sent to our
[37:37] day and we believe what he taught and
[37:40] what I'm doing is reading a lot this
[37:42] series of things and I gave them to you
[37:44] this morning and I I would ask you to
[37:47] keep those
[37:48] and uh
[37:51] to
[37:53] read
[37:54] the things of the Bible
[37:57] read the word of God
[38:00] see what the Bible says
[38:03] you know and if I'm out of that then you
[38:05] come and tell me where did I missed it
[38:07] because I want to be right but we wound
[38:10] up talking about
[38:13] that if we could show through the
[38:14] prophet messenger of the last days that
[38:16] we believe that the the word of God
[38:20] points to you and I
[38:23] and and to see you and I
[38:26] into the word and the way God describes
[38:30] it
[38:31] you know speaking of us
[38:33] is a wonderful thing we will when we get
[38:35] to the son of man talk we will be going
[38:37] over the Book of Revelation where it
[38:39] says one standing in the midst of the
[38:42] seven golden candlesticks standing in
[38:44] the church the midst of the whole seven
[38:46] Church ages
[38:48] one like unto the son of man
[38:52] it doesn't say the son of man was dark
[38:54] it says one like unto the son of man and
[38:56] what does it say
[38:58] gird about the pouch with a golden
[39:00] girdle
[39:01] well now that means a feminist side
[39:05] so it's not that God is feminish but the
[39:09] way he's describing it is in church form
[39:13] did he speaks of you and I
[39:15] as being the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[39:18] this wonderful thing some of them said
[39:20] Brother Don he said he wished I'd preach
[39:22] on the songs of Solomon because I mean
[39:24] that's a beautiful picture once you
[39:26] really begin to to get into it and
[39:30] studying on that and just seeing how
[39:32] that relates to us and what it is all
[39:34] right but now let's just let's just do
[39:36] as we were doing because I want to try
[39:38] to read this afternoon a whole lot
[39:41] and watch the things that we're reading
[39:45] the prophet was speaking as we gave this
[39:47] morning coming down from don't pull this
[39:50] up pull on up to number seven and then
[39:52] we'll start there but he was talking
[39:54] about in the message Source the father
[39:56] that he said I believe in the baptism of
[39:58] the Holy Ghost I believe the fullness of
[40:00] God is raining down on the church today
[40:07] he's saying I believe that all he all
[40:10] God was he poured into Christ in all
[40:13] Christ is poured into the church and
[40:15] then take her back to the Garden of Eden
[40:16] well that's the hour We're living
[40:20] right
[40:22] but we want to look at something and try
[40:25] to find it in some other form other than
[40:27] what he says about it all right he goes
[40:30] on talks about in the message India trip
[40:32] 57 that the fullness of God is in his
[40:36] church
[40:37] but we have it by measure
[40:40] see none of us claim to be the fullness
[40:43] of God brother random never claimed to
[40:45] be the fullness of God he was just a
[40:47] member of the body of Christ
[40:49] a minister a prophet sent to to bring us
[40:53] the word and that's what we believe all
[40:55] right see Paul was a man brought us the
[40:57] word we believe in that but we believe
[41:00] that it's going to be in the entire
[41:02] fullness why because he's building a
[41:04] body
[41:06] as we went through the Old Testament
[41:07] built a body
[41:10] through the prophets and the things you
[41:12] know and then the lice was John the
[41:14] Baptist come to introduce to the Lord
[41:16] Jesus Christ right and then we went to
[41:19] the church ages to show that the church
[41:21] Ages was building a body
[41:24] and that Delice would come the head to
[41:26] the body well we're already past the
[41:29] manifestation of of the situations
[41:32] or ought to be and we believe that he's
[41:36] coming now to join himself to the entire
[41:39] bride to get her ready for a Rapture get
[41:42] her ready for leaving out of here you
[41:44] know and all of that all right then the
[41:46] last we read the Good Shepherd of the
[41:47] Sheep
[41:48] uh I think I got that far didn't I
[41:51] all right pull up number six we'll start
[41:53] from right there and we'll we'll read as
[41:56] fast as we can this afternoon and let
[41:59] him say
[42:00] this is the the Good Shepherd of the
[42:02] sheep priests in 1957 uh e46.
[42:07] uh he had the spirit without measure you
[42:09] believe that in him never dwelt just a
[42:12] part of God but all of God was in his
[42:14] son Christ Jesus it was the fullness of
[42:16] the godhead bodily all of God was poured
[42:19] into Christ and all that God was was in
[42:22] Christ and all that Christ is he poured
[42:25] out on the church
[42:28] but you keep refusing it
[42:32] no you notice what he said you refused
[42:36] it now
[42:37] remember the time that the pope down
[42:41] through there the god that wanted to be
[42:43] the Pope that wrote to decree that it
[42:45] was better to serve God by force than
[42:47] not serve him at all and I'm not
[42:49] throwing off on them that was their
[42:51] thoughts and their ideas but he wrote
[42:53] that decree coming through well didn't
[42:56] it augustino hippo the Holy Ghost tried
[42:59] to come on him but he refused it
[43:02] and see then he turned away
[43:04] and when he did he he wrote to decrees
[43:07] in the thing all right but see that's
[43:08] nothing to do with me and you another
[43:10] argument with anybody there or what they
[43:13] done
[43:14] this is the age of finishing up but you
[43:17] and I
[43:18] we have a right to accept or to refuse
[43:22] what the Bible says about us see the
[43:25] things that now watch what he said if I
[43:27] do not the works of my father Believe Me
[43:30] Not
[43:31] and as the father has sent me how did
[43:34] the father send him the father sent him
[43:37] went with him and in him so send I you
[43:41] all right so then
[43:44] who are we we're Our God made manifest
[43:48] but yet we keep refusing
[43:51] the fact of believing it
[43:54] and he cannot do anything for us if we
[43:57] keep if we keep refusing or just at
[43:59] least
[44:00] mentally say it go to the next one
[44:03] having conferences 1960 608 uh e48 Jesus
[44:08] was the son of God created Son of God
[44:10] God overshadowed Mary and created a
[44:12] blood cell in her that brought forth the
[44:14] son Christ Jesus and God came down and
[44:17] dwelt in him in him was the fullness of
[44:19] the godhead bodily then he goes to
[44:22] Timothy 3 16 without controversy great
[44:24] is the mystery of godliness God was
[44:26] manifested in the flesh singing By
[44:28] Angels and so forth we saved up into
[44:30] Glory
[44:31] not a prophet
[44:33] that Jesus wasn't just a prophet he was
[44:35] a prophet who was he God made
[44:38] flesh and dwelt among us there he was
[44:40] Emmanuel the Holy Spirit called him
[44:42] Emmanuel God With Us and now it's God in
[44:45] us
[44:46] The Same Spirit
[44:49] and watching we receive it by portion or
[44:52] measure
[44:53] why because it takes all of us then to
[44:56] make the godhead
[44:58] you know well if you put all the
[44:59] measures back together what do you got I
[45:01] mean you take a spoonful out of the
[45:02] ocean you've only got to measure but if
[45:05] you could dip enough spoonfuls you could
[45:07] get all the water out of the ocean
[45:09] well
[45:10] taking quite a while to do that but you
[45:12] get it done you understand what's in the
[45:14] ocean so look he received it without
[45:16] portion or measure and him was the
[45:19] fullness of God
[45:20] all that what all that God was he poured
[45:23] into Christ and all Christ was poured
[45:25] over the church
[45:27] okay amen that day you'll know what the
[45:30] day that that you accept it today you
[45:33] quit refusing the day you accept what
[45:35] he's saying about you then what can that
[45:38] day you'll know that I am in the Father
[45:40] the father and me and I in you that's
[45:44] what Jesus said
[45:46] and you and me oh my when it comes that
[45:50] day now we're working on God orders just
[45:54] just let's just keep moving all right
[45:56] look the next the Patmos Vision preached
[45:59] in 1960 1205 1204 excuse Union 64
[46:03] paragraph
[46:05] this morning was more of the sermon type
[46:07] placing the foundation of the deity of
[46:11] the revelation God being revealed in
[46:13] Christ and when he believes it God was
[46:16] revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in
[46:19] his church in in Christ
[46:20] Now where's God to be revealed
[46:25] now if he was in revealed in Christ Now
[46:27] where's God to be revealed
[46:29] in his church
[46:31] with his people in US
[46:34] The Same Spirit the same work the same
[46:37] manifestation the same love the same
[46:40] forgiveness the same long-suffering
[46:42] gentleness patience peace mercy and all
[46:45] that was in Christ is what in the church
[46:50] remember keep this in mind all that God
[46:53] was he poured into Christ
[46:55] he was the fullness of the godhead
[46:56] bodily and all that Christ was he poured
[46:59] into the church
[47:01] God above us God With Us God in us the
[47:05] triunity of God God manifested in the
[47:10] three different manners Father Son and
[47:12] Holy Ghost see we don't believe in a
[47:14] trinity we believe in a Triune God yeah
[47:17] father son and all to God
[47:21] there was a time that he was in the Old
[47:23] Testament he was more or less father
[47:25] in the New Testament son now it's Christ
[47:28] all right but see that's where he's
[47:30] dwelling now in us all right go ahead
[47:35] um persevere 62 uh 218. I got 30 31
[47:41] Christ when he was on Earth was the body
[47:43] of God do you believe that I said he
[47:46] Hebrews 11 5 a body thou Hast prepared
[47:49] me all right God created his body it was
[47:52] a different body yet it was a human body
[47:54] you know Solomon built him a house but
[47:57] Stephen said how be it the most I don't
[47:58] dwell in houses made with hands but
[48:01] embody's eyes prepared me now God
[48:03] prepared himself a body in the form of
[48:05] the Lord Jesus which was the Christ
[48:08] meaning the anointed one and now all
[48:12] that God was was in Christ
[48:15] he was the fullness of the godhead
[48:17] bodily that's what the scripture says we
[48:20] just read it in Colossians now all that
[48:23] God was he poured into the into Christ
[48:25] poured out in Christ
[48:28] he was Emmanuel God With Us
[48:31] and all that Christ was he poured out
[48:33] into the church what is it anointed one
[48:36] to continue his work
[48:39] that his word might live
[48:42] constantly
[48:45] he come over into his church to continue
[48:47] his work there's any problem with that
[48:50] all right then the church would be God
[48:52] living
[48:53] upon the Earth
[48:56] all right he lived by the word of the
[48:58] father you believe that man shall not
[49:01] live by bread alone but by every word
[49:02] that precedeth from the mouth of God and
[49:04] the church don't live by bread alone but
[49:08] by the word of Christ
[49:10] and the Holy Spirit comes in and takes
[49:12] the word of Christ and makes it a living
[49:14] action today these signs shall follow
[49:17] them that believe okay now then he moves
[49:21] over into you and I because he took our
[49:25] place as I said this morning and now
[49:27] what's happening we are to take his
[49:29] place
[49:30] God using Humanity to talk to humanity
[49:36] because that's the chosen way to do go
[49:38] ahead for the spoken word is the
[49:39] Original Seed
[49:41] uh
[49:43] okay paragraph 178 going just run it up
[49:45] you read all this and it'll it's on the
[49:47] internet they can read all of it
[49:49] if you want a church start with the word
[49:51] of God
[49:54] if you you want a life of God start with
[49:57] the word of God
[49:59] accept the word of God in his fullness
[50:02] every measure of it and then let
[50:05] now watch if that is the fullness of God
[50:08] in you
[50:10] then the rain that's falling will
[50:13] produce exactly what's in your garden
[50:17] right all right would you say well you
[50:21] just explained that it's by measure as
[50:23] it is by measure but you know every
[50:25] Spoonful is taken out of the ocean is
[50:28] exactly
[50:29] the same chemical
[50:32] that's what's in the ocean it's just
[50:34] measured
[50:36] or ever born again believer in the body
[50:38] of Christ is God made manifest in that
[50:41] person
[50:42] that's what the new birth is about
[50:44] that's that's why it's so wonderful
[50:46] that's the time it's housing
[50:49] you you just get what's in your garden
[50:50] keep on going lean not to your own
[50:52] understanding 1965.
[50:55] 120.
[50:57] um progress 17 18. so you see if you
[51:00] were in the foreknowledge of God
[51:02] then you are becoming a part of God
[51:06] is any problem with that terminology
[51:10] if God is living in you
[51:13] spiritually speaking not physically see
[51:17] spiritually speaking by the new birth
[51:19] he's living in you well then you're part
[51:22] of God
[51:24] that's not a uh that should be an easy
[51:26] part to understand
[51:28] you know
[51:29] God's in here
[51:32] then what's in here of God is a part of
[51:35] God
[51:36] right
[51:38] see that that shouldn't be anything that
[51:40] would be hard to understand
[51:42] so what then you are becoming
[51:46] a part of God and the only way you can
[51:48] be a Son of God or daughter of God you
[51:51] have to be part of God and God is
[51:53] incomplete without you
[51:55] I like that don't you
[51:57] yeah now he chose it to me that way
[52:02] it's not I'm so important
[52:04] if you don't know how important you are
[52:07] get you a glass of water stick your
[52:09] finger down in the glass of water
[52:11] and pull it up and show me the hole
[52:15] right comical but true
[52:18] ain't no hole left
[52:20] that's how important we are
[52:22] but remember he's very important all
[52:25] right the only way you can be a Son of
[52:27] God or daughter or God you had to be a
[52:29] part of God and God isn't complete
[52:30] without you has to be that's right
[52:32] because there's only one only one
[52:35] resource of eternal life and that's God
[52:38] and him alone has eternal life so then
[52:42] when he gives you eternal life
[52:46] see that's eternal life
[52:49] all right now you're a part of him and
[52:51] in so much that you're an attribute
[52:53] or in his thinking in the beginning and
[52:57] that because he thought of you in the
[52:58] beginning it gives that little tug
[53:01] towards him that's what has to be
[53:03] quickened
[53:06] some of them will never be quickened why
[53:10] they just don't have it that's all
[53:13] just like you put a grain of corn in the
[53:15] ground
[53:16] didn't have ever how pretty it was if it
[53:20] didn't have the germ of life in it it
[53:22] can never be quickened but the German
[53:24] life has to be there first anybody knows
[53:27] planting corn planting anything you you
[53:29] go out and you plant a seed if the germ
[53:32] is not in there that's why you go down
[53:34] there and you pick up your seed and
[53:35] it'll say 99 germatized
[53:38] or 80 or 60 you know what that means
[53:41] that means if it's 80 germatized that
[53:43] means 80 percent of it's going to come
[53:44] up the other 20 ain't gonna come up
[53:47] because it's telling you what's
[53:48] germatized without the German life in
[53:50] you it just won't work okay go to the
[53:52] next one
[53:54] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[53:56] 1963 728 paragraph 380 and in there
[54:00] there would be a Time come when he could
[54:02] express himself
[54:04] in fullness of his godhead deity
[54:09] through his church
[54:13] how the preeminist is in his church oh
[54:16] my what the anointed man
[54:19] now the anointed people
[54:22] oh my to bring back the anointed bride
[54:24] and bridegroom
[54:26] that's the purpose of it anointed by why
[54:29] accepting what Eve turned down and Adam
[54:32] coming back with the anointing of the
[54:34] word because he said my word is spirit
[54:36] see Anointed with the word
[54:38] what Eve turned down he comes back and
[54:42] we accept
[54:43] see how that hybrid condition again just
[54:46] exactly what he's done Eve right go to
[54:50] the next
[54:54] paragraph
[54:56] 146 of the Christ of history when I
[54:58] think I just see denominations fights
[55:00] off the scene and everything else
[55:02] just going see when I see God's Great
[55:05] purpose revealing himself and having
[55:08] first to reveal himself in Christ the
[55:11] fullness of the godhead bodily and then
[55:13] to bring that fullness of godhead bodily
[55:16] into a people
[55:19] that he could have the preeminances the
[55:22] oversight deleting okay
[55:25] now do we believe that
[55:27] okay go ahead to the next
[55:30] still in Christ Mr God revealed
[55:32] paragraph 150 161.
[55:37] complete godness or you'd look at it in
[55:39] 60. God expressed in Jesus Christ he was
[55:41] both Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[55:43] fullness of the godhead bodily okay
[55:46] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[55:48] bodily dwells in his church
[55:51] now I said when I started most of this
[55:54] morning especially if I can read to you
[55:56] that brother Brown says these things
[55:59] we have no right if we're going to
[56:01] accept him as the messenger to argue
[56:05] with that point
[56:06] no more than we would argue with Paul
[56:09] saying that he was the head of the body
[56:13] right and all of that
[56:15] because we're not making demand deity
[56:19] we're believing the word that's brought
[56:21] is is that deity because you and I by
[56:24] ourselves cannot be God
[56:28] but God can be in each one of us
[56:31] you know there's seven billion people in
[56:33] the world today you know if everybody
[56:34] believed God could be in seven billion
[56:37] people
[56:37] you believe that
[56:39] I do
[56:41] but you know the reason is not going to
[56:42] be because they're not going to believe
[56:43] it
[56:44] now a lot of it hadn't heard but you
[56:46] know what I'm saying so watch what he
[56:48] said now the complete fullness of the
[56:49] godhead bodily dwelled in this church
[56:51] the preeminances all that God was he
[56:55] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[56:57] was he poured into the church the
[57:00] Believers
[57:04] now so it's not in everybody
[57:06] it's only into Believers go to the next
[57:08] we have seen this star in the east and
[57:10] come to worship 63 12-16 and when Christ
[57:13] was being formed in Mary quickly come to
[57:16] King's commandment
[57:18] you remember what happened there when
[57:20] when Jesus was born the king's
[57:22] Commandments was to kill all the babies
[57:24] remember so then as quick as Jesus was
[57:27] born they had to take him Joseph and
[57:29] Mary had to leave and go down into Egypt
[57:31] and that would fulfill the scriptures
[57:33] out of Egypt I call my son see that
[57:36] would would fulfill the scriptures but
[57:37] they had to do that so when Christ was
[57:39] being formed in Mary quickly come to
[57:41] King's commandment all you people just
[57:44] as she was now see his thought the
[57:46] Christ was becoming a full baby
[57:49] ready to be delivered right then the
[57:52] great persecution
[57:53] all right that's when they started
[57:54] killing him
[57:55] now now the the babies being formed the
[58:00] baby's been formed for a long time along
[58:04] in the womb
[58:05] now we've been through that that Mary
[58:09] was not the very seed herself the seed
[58:13] was in Mary
[58:14] she gave birth to God that didn't make
[58:17] her God
[58:18] she gave birth to the one that was
[58:20] within her and that's exactly what we're
[58:22] supposed to be doing
[58:24] all right
[58:26] now the baby's been formed for a long
[58:28] time along in the womb but this is
[58:30] coming the last days when the
[58:32] completeness when the fullness of the
[58:34] godhead when the fullness of Christ is
[58:36] to be manifest among his people he said
[58:39] so he promised it in his word and when
[58:42] that fullness you see there is unusual
[58:45] things begin to happen
[58:49] that he promised now you know what he's
[58:51] talking about
[58:52] anytime God is moving unusual things
[58:55] starts happening they started killing
[58:57] the babies when Christ was fixing to
[59:00] come into the world the lord Jesus and
[59:02] all trying to get him all right so it's
[59:04] the end time it's going to do the same
[59:05] that's the reason our Great Society
[59:08] lives and things can't understand that
[59:12] it's foolishness to them
[59:14] now watch they're forming a council of
[59:17] churches
[59:19] that's not foolishness to them to form a
[59:22] council of churches
[59:25] with his foolishness for us to stay out
[59:29] of that
[59:31] you know that's what they think but look
[59:36] they're forming a council of churches
[59:38] see just the time when the churches
[59:41] begin to get to its feet
[59:45] we're the Supernatural is begin to work
[59:48] now they've all went into a group and
[59:52] they're going to try to stop this stuff
[59:54] just exactly like it was then so you see
[59:57] it now tightening down coming down to
[1:00:00] the point go ahead who is this
[1:00:02] Melchizedek notice these are in 64.
[1:00:04] threes four and five
[1:00:07] all right
[1:00:09] paragraph 42 who's this melchized notice
[1:00:12] like the scripture he hides with a mask
[1:00:14] over it that's what God has done to this
[1:00:16] age it's been hid all these things has
[1:00:19] been hid and it's supposed to be
[1:00:21] revealed in this age now the Bible says
[1:00:23] they will be revealed in the latter
[1:00:25] times it's like a sculpture keeping
[1:00:28] his his piece of work all covered over
[1:00:31] until the time
[1:00:33] he takes the mask off of it and there it
[1:00:35] is and that's what the Bible has been
[1:00:37] it's been a work of God
[1:00:39] that's been covered up and it's been hid
[1:00:42] since the foundation of the world
[1:00:44] in its Sevenfold mystery and God
[1:00:47] promised in this day at the age of this
[1:00:50] lady of sin Church which is now see he
[1:00:53] would take the mask off of the whole
[1:00:55] thing and we could see it what a
[1:00:58] glorious thing God in morphy
[1:01:03] in morphe means god changes form
[1:01:07] same God different form dimorphic I'm
[1:01:10] asking the pillar of fire god amorphic
[1:01:13] in the Man Called Jesus God in Murphy in
[1:01:16] his church
[1:01:18] God above us God With Us God in us the
[1:01:21] condescending of God it's been him the
[1:01:22] whole time it ain't been me and you
[1:01:24] we ain't even more fooling with
[1:01:27] that's what he is go ahead to the next I
[1:01:29] want to get these reading out of the way
[1:01:35] we're not a Jehovah Witness reading room
[1:01:37] but I sure do love the word
[1:01:40] so the Mighty God unveiled before 64 629
[1:01:44] paragraph 1 30. then it was God in them
[1:01:47] days it was God and a man
[1:01:49] his son Jesus Christ we believe that not
[1:01:52] just a prophet not just an ordinary man
[1:01:55] ordinary human it was God in Christ God
[1:01:58] in the man the fullness of the godhead
[1:02:00] bodily in a man God in a in a man now
[1:02:03] it's God in men the fullness of the
[1:02:06] godhead bodily
[1:02:08] in his entire church
[1:02:11] manifesting himself fulfilling his word
[1:02:14] okay go to the next God's only provided
[1:02:17] place of worship
[1:02:19] uh paragraph 262.
[1:02:22] Richard 65 11 28 in the morning service
[1:02:25] the lutherans under justification the
[1:02:28] feet raised it like that Wesley under
[1:02:30] sanctification the Pentecostals under
[1:02:33] the arms the works and deeds and so
[1:02:34] forth had to be colonists had to be
[1:02:37] Armenian had to be legalistic a legalist
[1:02:40] but now we come to the Head
[1:02:42] the Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone
[1:02:46] cried The Headstone crying what Grace
[1:02:48] Grace passed from death and Creed into a
[1:02:53] Living Word of the Living God that's
[1:02:55] God's only provided plan for this age
[1:02:58] right his sons in the word age quickened
[1:03:03] by the spirit like a spark that's lit
[1:03:06] off of something to make it alive and
[1:03:09] seated now in Heavenly places
[1:03:12] in present tense already alive and
[1:03:15] subject to ever promise in the word then
[1:03:18] what does that do you being a part of
[1:03:21] God's Gene a part of the word
[1:03:24] other men are part of God's word seated
[1:03:27] together manifested the entire body of
[1:03:30] Christ because there's no leaven among
[1:03:33] you
[1:03:34] see what he's talking about brother
[1:03:36] Brown no living among you just the word
[1:03:40] only seated in Heavenly places
[1:03:43] in the door where he put his name Christ
[1:03:46] Jesus raise it on up
[1:03:49] no leaven among you
[1:03:53] now you can see what's keeping it from
[1:03:54] being done leaven means something you've
[1:03:57] added you you know your women are very
[1:04:00] familiar with leaven you you take your
[1:04:02] bread especially the old days you didn't
[1:04:05] have all that self-rising stuff and you
[1:04:08] had to put a little Evan in to make it
[1:04:11] rise because it would work even though
[1:04:13] what he said no leaven among you
[1:04:15] that brings the end our fullness of the
[1:04:17] godhead bodily
[1:04:18] among you
[1:04:21] okay
[1:04:22] couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't
[1:04:23] do it Wednesdays couldn't do it in
[1:04:25] Pentecostal age but in the day when the
[1:04:27] son of man will be manifested revealed
[1:04:30] brought back to the church together with
[1:04:32] the entire deity of God among his people
[1:04:36] join the sign visible signs
[1:04:39] manifesting himself like he did at the
[1:04:41] beginning
[1:04:42] when he was manifested on Earth in the
[1:04:44] form of a prophet God
[1:04:46] what about that
[1:04:49] a prophet God
[1:04:51] Jesus was
[1:04:54] a prophet but he was God
[1:04:58] all right now I believe that he so used
[1:05:01] this end time prophet
[1:05:03] until it's hard to separate the man from
[1:05:07] the message he was bringing and that's
[1:05:09] why people believe it was deity
[1:05:11] but I don't believe that
[1:05:14] I believe ever born again believer
[1:05:17] is God made manifest there's your dear
[1:05:20] teaches I believe all right
[1:05:23] Marin Oh Glory promised by the Malachi 4
[1:05:26] promised by the rest of the scriptures
[1:05:28] where you worship at
[1:05:31] the house of God seated in present tense
[1:05:34] okay
[1:05:35] now go on to the next
[1:05:38] the Rapture preached in 1965-12
[1:05:41] 04.
[1:05:43] paragraph 116. look back in that little
[1:05:47] wheat
[1:05:48] now getting their back to our thought of
[1:05:50] where we was at
[1:05:52] when you look at it
[1:05:54] you know you raise wheat you go out
[1:05:55] there and it comes up and you say I got
[1:05:57] a feel for the week well that's true
[1:05:58] this week
[1:05:59] it don't change into corn and something
[1:06:01] else is weak but you can't gather it
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] all right
[1:06:06] so then you're seeing why that he's
[1:06:07] having to wait till the end time to do
[1:06:09] these things because as it was coming
[1:06:12] down in the wheat it comes up in the
[1:06:14] stalk it even comes up into the shuck
[1:06:17] or like corn with the shuck on it me
[1:06:21] that's not the wheat
[1:06:24] you pull the shark back and you look
[1:06:25] down in there
[1:06:27] and there's a little bitty spot in there
[1:06:29] there's your wheat I mean for so you
[1:06:32] don't gather it
[1:06:34] as I said about corn I love corn when it
[1:06:37] gets up good and juicy don't you
[1:06:40] and you get it man you put it in a pot
[1:06:42] you know we used to take it and put it
[1:06:43] in the ground said put a fire on top of
[1:06:45] it and you know then we'd pull it up and
[1:06:48] Shake It Off and eat it and uh but you
[1:06:51] don't dare try to plant that
[1:06:54] why
[1:06:56] so you leave the corn or the wheat until
[1:06:59] it totally dries
[1:07:03] then you gather it sensible right so
[1:07:05] that's what he's talking about
[1:07:07] you got a little bit of wheat back there
[1:07:09] you have to take a dirty fire Periscope
[1:07:12] 30 Power Scope
[1:07:15] to look into it to see the little bud of
[1:07:16] wheat back there it's way back in dark
[1:07:19] but it starts growing
[1:07:21] Now That Shook has to be there to
[1:07:24] shelter that to give it a chance to get
[1:07:26] out
[1:07:28] but then when it begins to grow
[1:07:30] and the message begins to spread
[1:07:35] the endless shot pulls away from it
[1:07:39] and the life goes right out of that
[1:07:41] shook right into the wheat goes out
[1:07:44] that's the way each age done
[1:07:48] it's just it can't beat nature it's
[1:07:52] God's continuity I already say that word
[1:07:54] the way he does things all right go
[1:07:57] ahead
[1:08:00] identified Masterpiece of Christ now
[1:08:02] this one's in Yuma Arizona not not the
[1:08:04] masterpiece 64 1205 and when he made his
[1:08:08] first Masterpiece he put him behind the
[1:08:11] word
[1:08:11] when he made his second Masterpiece he
[1:08:14] was the word
[1:08:16] he made man in the garden he put him
[1:08:18] behind the word right
[1:08:20] told him not to fool around
[1:08:22] but when he made the next Masterpiece
[1:08:24] was with Jesus Christ he was the word he
[1:08:27] wasn't just behind the word he was the
[1:08:29] word not behind the word but he wants
[1:08:31] the word God never changes his plan
[1:08:33] that's exactly what started off to do
[1:08:35] his first church went with the word all
[1:08:39] right write it on up called it it's
[1:08:41] covering and getting us to a place
[1:08:43] that he's explaining it God separates
[1:08:47] he is trying to separate his church from
[1:08:50] the world but the church wants to go on
[1:08:53] with the world
[1:08:54] but his people is still segregated
[1:08:57] segregated to him
[1:08:59] who is he the word
[1:09:02] now he said I believe in segregation
[1:09:06] that means to be separated
[1:09:09] not talking about black white yellow
[1:09:10] green blue whatever color that doesn't
[1:09:13] have anything to do with it it's talking
[1:09:15] about God wants us separated
[1:09:18] the word that started in the original
[1:09:21] has got to come back
[1:09:22] all right going to the next
[1:09:26] uh the invisible Union
[1:09:30] the brought across 65 11 25.
[1:09:33] can't you see where we're standing
[1:09:36] life is in the grain again
[1:09:39] what is it
[1:09:40] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:09:43] went in the ground
[1:09:44] the same Jesus in The Bride form
[1:09:49] same power same church same thing same
[1:09:52] word but I don't see nothing going on
[1:10:01] see the word sucked up through these and
[1:10:03] come out here and come to a head here
[1:10:06] and all that life that went through here
[1:10:07] picked up his people that's forming you
[1:10:11] performing up excuse into a head for the
[1:10:14] Rapture speaking on that tomorrow night
[1:10:15] the Lord with us well you well you
[1:10:19] separated from your first Union by
[1:10:22] spiritual death now you are born again
[1:10:24] are remarried again to the new spiritual
[1:10:27] union
[1:10:28] see of not your natural life of the
[1:10:33] things of the world
[1:10:34] but of eternal life
[1:10:36] a germ that was in you at the beginning
[1:10:38] found you so you're returning back to
[1:10:40] the original
[1:10:43] look what he says coming up I have heard
[1:10:45] but now I see 65 11 27
[1:10:50] that's the shut that's on the wheat they
[1:10:53] come out
[1:10:55] you go out there and look and you look
[1:10:56] especially we're familiar with corn more
[1:10:58] than wheat you go out and you look and
[1:11:01] you see that ear
[1:11:02] you say man I've got a feel full of corn
[1:11:07] it might be good to pull and eat some
[1:11:10] you know we're not uh we're not like a
[1:11:13] lot of people
[1:11:14] our green beans are very small
[1:11:17] because we we want to get them tender
[1:11:20] well the corn when it begins to come on
[1:11:22] and form real good we start eating it
[1:11:25] a lot of people said don't got to leave
[1:11:27] it well that's good okay I plan enough
[1:11:29] to where I can leave some
[1:11:31] but then I like to gather it and eat it
[1:11:33] but don't plant it
[1:11:36] you can't do that so that's what he's
[1:11:38] explaining our Christian Life is the
[1:11:41] same way
[1:11:43] God doesn't expect everything to be the
[1:11:47] same he didn't expect Martin Luther in
[1:11:49] the Lutheran age to understand what you
[1:11:51] and I understand
[1:11:55] he's waited a long time
[1:11:57] to bring us to a place
[1:12:00] right
[1:12:01] now come on
[1:12:03] it's like a week but there was no wheat
[1:12:05] to it it opens up but the grain comes
[1:12:07] out of that they organized they killed
[1:12:09] themselves
[1:12:11] the Irish were they die they're stalks
[1:12:14] but the wheat has come up through there
[1:12:17] and now it's begin to form
[1:12:21] in the bride form
[1:12:23] the corn of wheat that fell into the
[1:12:24] ground
[1:12:25] through the Dark Ages see it it had to
[1:12:29] die
[1:12:30] all right look at the next
[1:12:32] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:12:34] paragraph 293.
[1:12:38] look God Elohim standing there in human
[1:12:41] flesh
[1:12:43] showing that he would so anoint his
[1:12:45] church in the last days
[1:12:50] it'd be God working in human flesh again
[1:12:55] right as it was in the days of summer so
[1:12:58] shall it be at that at the coming of the
[1:12:59] son of man same kind of a thing they see
[1:13:02] it right there in the scripture read it
[1:13:04] search the scriptures or in them you
[1:13:06] think you have eternal life and there
[1:13:08] they that testify this
[1:13:11] the scriptures testifier tells you that
[1:13:13] God was standing there saying
[1:13:17] that he would come back in the last days
[1:13:19] right look at the last one
[1:13:22] I have heard but now I see
[1:13:25] 65 11 27. everybody knows that we have a
[1:13:29] promise of the church condition
[1:13:31] in the last day the church in its
[1:13:34] present condition
[1:13:36] can never fulfill the Commandments of
[1:13:38] God okay
[1:13:40] the Great Commission
[1:13:42] could never
[1:13:43] call the bride out
[1:13:45] which one would do it
[1:13:48] what group The
[1:13:50] Pentecostals
[1:13:53] I should say not
[1:13:55] none of the rest of them
[1:13:57] that's to shuck that's on the wheat they
[1:14:01] come out look like exactly like the
[1:14:02] wheat but there was no wheat in it opens
[1:14:05] up but the grain comes out of that they
[1:14:08] were nice they die they organized they
[1:14:10] kill themselves that's where they die
[1:14:12] they're stalks but the wheat has come up
[1:14:15] through there and now it's beginning to
[1:14:17] form in the bride form the corn of wheat
[1:14:20] that fell into the ground through the
[1:14:22] Dark Ages
[1:14:23] a lot of reading fast reading
[1:14:26] but just to show you
[1:14:28] what to profit this message has been
[1:14:30] telling
[1:14:31] pointing he said on spoken words reading
[1:14:34] a seed
[1:14:35] he'd be pointing to a word born Pride
[1:14:38] well why can't we believe
[1:14:41] that we are the people of God is that
[1:14:43] any problem
[1:14:46] I mean I thought everybody was supposed
[1:14:49] to believe that they were the people of
[1:14:51] God where you'd be Manchester Baptist
[1:14:52] Presbyterian Pentecostal Catholics or
[1:14:54] anything I thought we all believe we
[1:14:56] were the people of God that's what the
[1:14:58] church is about
[1:15:00] right if not we'd just be anything we
[1:15:03] won't do
[1:15:05] what everybody claims to be the people
[1:15:07] of God
[1:15:09] well
[1:15:11] in all of that there is a true people
[1:15:13] wanting to be the people of God
[1:15:19] then we're not going off on anybody
[1:15:22] because they're good people in all
[1:15:23] churches
[1:15:25] there's people in those churches there's
[1:15:27] Catholic people that make us ashamed of
[1:15:29] ourselves as the humbleness the goodness
[1:15:31] the people
[1:15:33] not against them
[1:15:35] I'm against a system bark that tries to
[1:15:38] control
[1:15:40] and that's just as much in the Baptist
[1:15:43] the Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals
[1:15:45] and the people of this message
[1:15:49] we want to call them Bridal mice that's
[1:15:51] all right with me
[1:15:53] blue lights you know
[1:15:57] because we're not the only group
[1:16:00] we're not the only ones trying to strive
[1:16:01] to be the word
[1:16:04] look
[1:16:06] I have to say it this way we're the only
[1:16:09] ones I want I'm involved with
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:13] you know and preaching to you and I and
[1:16:16] trying my best to live but yet in a very
[1:16:19] poor manner before you as a Christian
[1:16:25] in a very poor Manner and I mean not
[1:16:27] honestly because I am a poor very poor
[1:16:30] example but I I at least have a
[1:16:32] repentant attitude you know and I want
[1:16:35] to be right
[1:16:36] one because I believe God is trying his
[1:16:38] best to to be in the people in the end
[1:16:41] time
[1:16:44] because something's going to happen
[1:16:47] we've all talked every denomination
[1:16:49] church or whatever it was
[1:16:51] um all of them teach of a end of the
[1:16:54] world
[1:16:55] but I'm coming to the old Indian he had
[1:16:59] the Happy Hunting Ground
[1:17:00] and everybody's got it the Muslims the
[1:17:03] Buddha the Hindus they got a world to go
[1:17:06] to and a thing to be done because that's
[1:17:08] a religious principle of mind
[1:17:12] what do you see what I'm talking about
[1:17:17] if God says
[1:17:21] that I am something why can't I say I'm
[1:17:23] sorry
[1:17:27] oh in the book of Acts was quoting this
[1:17:29] morning Paul said we are God's offspring
[1:17:34] well is there any problem
[1:17:38] would being the children of God
[1:17:43] but to recognize the day that we're
[1:17:45] living
[1:17:47] the time we are here
[1:17:51] wouldn't it been something if and it you
[1:17:54] know could have positively been done but
[1:17:56] wouldn't it been something for for uh
[1:17:59] Moses just said well no avail an art and
[1:18:02] flowed them out we're down here on the
[1:18:04] side of the Nile River
[1:18:06] and we'll just build an ark float the
[1:18:08] people out
[1:18:10] it might have been an easier way to got
[1:18:12] out than what to talk you know but that
[1:18:14] was not it the ark had done been built
[1:18:18] that was God's way in the time of Noah
[1:18:21] but it wasn't not God's way in the time
[1:18:23] of Moses and the children of Israel he
[1:18:26] was out through the wilderness
[1:18:28] that was his way
[1:18:31] we'll see all of those Asian all of
[1:18:32] those times has been what they're
[1:18:33] supposed to be
[1:18:35] amen that's what I said we're not
[1:18:36] throwing off on churches and people
[1:18:40] those people have fulfilled their age
[1:18:43] their time
[1:18:46] but don't be looking back
[1:18:53] to say we are this because we have stood
[1:18:57] so long
[1:19:00] prostitutions went way high
[1:19:03] in the last days that means right
[1:19:05] because it's been here so long
[1:19:07] when it was the original in the garden
[1:19:09] you know
[1:19:12] you sound silly on but maybe silly if
[1:19:14] it's the right point
[1:19:17] all I want us to do church is to just
[1:19:20] let God live in our hearts in our lives
[1:19:24] and try our best to serve him
[1:19:27] and to be conscious of ourselves
[1:19:31] to not just live haphazardly and and
[1:19:34] just anything goes
[1:19:38] but to believe
[1:19:42] I mean don't you want your children to
[1:19:44] be good
[1:19:46] and live and do
[1:19:49] well that's the way God wants it
[1:19:51] he wants his church to just be good and
[1:19:53] be faithful
[1:19:55] where I hear we're in the world as Jesus
[1:19:57] said but we're not out of the world
[1:20:02] what do you see what I'm talking about
[1:20:04] the prophet emphasized
[1:20:06] she would be the word
[1:20:09] made flesh
[1:20:11] somebody's got to make it manifest
[1:20:15] he said to bride with vindicate Malachi
[1:20:17] 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. in these
[1:20:21] scriptures
[1:20:22] why or did I keep referring to Martin
[1:20:25] Luther
[1:20:26] when he protested the Catholic Church
[1:20:29] it didn't bother them for him to protest
[1:20:31] but when the people
[1:20:34] begin to Rally around what he taught
[1:20:38] then they got concerned
[1:20:42] well see that's the way it is with the
[1:20:43] Devil
[1:20:45] they don't care what you blabber about
[1:20:48] you know
[1:20:49] well we're all one
[1:20:52] let's just come together and let's be
[1:20:54] one
[1:20:54] that's what I'm trying to do is for us
[1:20:57] to come together be one in God's word
[1:21:02] that's all I'm asking
[1:21:06] is for us to become one in this world
[1:21:10] for us to believe
[1:21:13] what God has called us
[1:21:18] when he says we're his people why can't
[1:21:20] we say we're his people
[1:21:25] why can't we say we are his people in
[1:21:27] the chief of his pastor
[1:21:29] the word says we are
[1:21:33] why can't we believe the word
[1:21:35] we were kind of laughing like not in
[1:21:37] I believe it was in the songs of Solomon
[1:21:39] it's the reading and I told sister
[1:21:42] Monica I said now Sister Monica brother
[1:21:44] Bob is going to describe you
[1:21:48] you know
[1:21:49] in a few minutes it become very comical
[1:21:52] but remember in the songs of Solomon he
[1:21:54] was describing how beautiful his little
[1:21:56] wife was a little girl
[1:21:58] and he said she had a neck like a swan
[1:22:04] you know
[1:22:06] as we call it today legs like a jay bird
[1:22:08] or something you know
[1:22:10] and
[1:22:12] to be describing how beautiful she was
[1:22:16] but you'd really have to think about it
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:20] see she looks like a flock of sheep
[1:22:22] going across a hill
[1:22:27] well you're trying to describe your wife
[1:22:29] like that today and you might get in
[1:22:31] trouble you know
[1:22:37] because you see Church
[1:22:40] we are his people and why can't we
[1:22:42] confess what he says we are
[1:22:46] his offspring why can't we say that
[1:22:51] amen that's all God is asking us to do
[1:22:52] and let him make the rest of it manifest
[1:22:57] because when the dead was raised that
[1:23:00] we've recorded talked about it a while
[1:23:01] ago when Wade and I were there and the
[1:23:03] man died we didn't make him die
[1:23:07] but we didn't know what to do
[1:23:10] and Wade says daddy the Man's dead
[1:23:14] and we were trying to call 9-1-1 and we
[1:23:17] couldn't get no connection because we
[1:23:18] were out in the country away from the
[1:23:20] the phone range you know thing that what
[1:23:22] you call it
[1:23:24] and he said daddy he's dying he's dead
[1:23:27] his eyes had rolled back
[1:23:31] and for no reason whatsoever why would I
[1:23:34] do it I just called his name but I
[1:23:37] called it real line I said random
[1:23:40] Jesus
[1:23:42] holds his eyes up and look he said what
[1:23:47] what
[1:23:49] you said well he wasn't really dead
[1:23:51] what's all right
[1:23:54] we just tell what happened
[1:23:57] and brother Gary
[1:23:59] Mr Margaret
[1:24:03] she said
[1:24:04] his eyes rolled back he was dead
[1:24:06] nobody didn't think Sister Margaret had
[1:24:09] a whole lot of God you know
[1:24:11] she was just a little old sister
[1:24:16] she didn't understand all the Mysteries
[1:24:19] and knew all about the great things but
[1:24:21] yet she called his name and prayed for
[1:24:24] him
[1:24:25] and God brought him back to life
[1:24:29] why can't we believe that
[1:24:34] let's just say thank you Lord God is
[1:24:36] nothing it don't
[1:24:39] make us anything
[1:24:42] it makes him a great God
[1:24:45] that's all I'm trying to do is get you
[1:24:47] to see the God that I try to serve
[1:24:51] and that God can do all things
[1:24:54] but you know what he needs somebody to
[1:24:57] believe him
[1:25:00] that's what he's always wanted he had to
[1:25:02] wait until the Moses come along because
[1:25:04] there were a lot of good people in the
[1:25:05] days and times Moses was on the Earth
[1:25:07] but he had to wait until Moses came
[1:25:11] why because Moses would be the only one
[1:25:13] who would believe it
[1:25:14] there were a lot of beautiful
[1:25:16] clean
[1:25:18] virgins in the days of Mary
[1:25:23] but he waited until Isaiah had already
[1:25:27] said it you know virgins y'all can see
[1:25:28] and God waited thousands of years
[1:25:34] until the right person
[1:25:36] came on Earth
[1:25:39] and she would say be it unto me
[1:25:41] according to Thy Word
[1:25:44] and why because she believed it
[1:25:47] do we believe God
[1:25:50] are we going to believe what somebody
[1:25:51] else has taught us
[1:25:54] and is it going to the horse and sit
[1:25:56] your rigamarore for somebody to say I
[1:25:58] don't agree with you
[1:26:01] I don't agree with my own self most of
[1:26:03] the time
[1:26:05] how about you
[1:26:08] but I'm believing in God that's real
[1:26:11] and I believe that's what he's trying to
[1:26:12] do
[1:26:14] is to live in you and I
[1:26:17] is that a hard thing
[1:26:19] well we got to quit this we got to quit
[1:26:21] that we got to do it got to do that
[1:26:24] where's that in the word
[1:26:27] you don't have to quit nothing
[1:26:30] you just get born again let God take
[1:26:32] care of it
[1:26:35] right
[1:26:36] there's good morning and let God take
[1:26:38] her
[1:26:39] is there any problems with that
[1:26:42] you know
[1:26:43] is there any problems with you sisters
[1:26:45] just being a wife
[1:26:48] you know
[1:26:52] did her drudgery
[1:26:57] well I don't mean this wrong I mean it
[1:27:00] right and sweet as I can but you know
[1:27:03] it's the same side on the man on the
[1:27:04] other side if you women say it's a hard
[1:27:07] thing to just be a woman it's the same
[1:27:08] thing to be a man
[1:27:11] you know we have to put up with y'all
[1:27:16] right
[1:27:19] you know all I asked for my wife had to
[1:27:20] put up with me
[1:27:24] right
[1:27:25] just love me
[1:27:28] but then I don't have to go in there
[1:27:29] every day you know
[1:27:30] because most of the time I'll cook her
[1:27:32] breakfast not no problem
[1:27:34] I run things around my house
[1:27:36] the vacuum cleaner the washing machine
[1:27:40] no problems with it
[1:27:46] I always go in there and I say hey
[1:27:48] Sleeping Beauty
[1:27:49] your breakfast is ready
[1:27:54] you know
[1:27:55] kiss her on the cheek tell her breakfast
[1:27:57] is ready
[1:27:59] well you know what if I don't get up and
[1:28:01] cook breakfast she does
[1:28:05] well
[1:28:08] I don't have to tell her you got to get
[1:28:09] up now I call you my wife
[1:28:13] no she does everything the wife's
[1:28:15] supposed to do
[1:28:17] you know
[1:28:18] and that way we just love each other
[1:28:20] well why can't we think about carbide
[1:28:22] and the pride of Christ in his church
[1:28:26] you know God looks over a lot of our
[1:28:27] faults and failures
[1:28:29] you got to agree with that
[1:28:31] right he certainly looks over
[1:28:35] our problems
[1:28:37] to be able to
[1:28:40] even exist with us
[1:28:42] you know but you know
[1:28:44] why can't we just be people and just
[1:28:48] accept What God Says About Us
[1:28:51] and be happy
[1:28:53] amen and believe it then we don't have
[1:28:55] to try to figure it out
[1:29:00] we just have to believe what God says
[1:29:05] and it don't make my wife no more my
[1:29:08] life if she cooks me my breakfast
[1:29:13] actually is part of her doing
[1:29:17] right
[1:29:19] I just learned years ago to be able to
[1:29:21] fry an egg you know I don't mind it
[1:29:27] I don't go in there and bless God you
[1:29:29] and my wife get out of bed you got to
[1:29:30] cook some breakfast
[1:29:35] no
[1:29:37] I'm just happy about being what we are
[1:29:41] right I can fry cornbread
[1:29:43] but that's about as far as I can go
[1:29:46] you know
[1:29:48] you see I got my side
[1:29:51] you know they say the women brain in the
[1:29:55] man's brain the demand what it the man
[1:29:56] uses left inside
[1:29:58] of his brain and the woman she uses the
[1:30:01] right hand side because she's in a right
[1:30:02] mind
[1:30:04] okay said you're in your right mind and
[1:30:07] we're not
[1:30:09] all right
[1:30:10] but see
[1:30:12] her side of the brain is what build a
[1:30:15] house I mean clean the house have kids
[1:30:17] and do what's the man's side
[1:30:19] hunting and fishing
[1:30:21] he said no no it's for working and
[1:30:23] supplying anything and that's the
[1:30:25] difference in the way you're split well
[1:30:27] God made us that a way why not be happy
[1:30:33] I enjoyed today's my wife was able to go
[1:30:36] with me hunting
[1:30:39] and it didn't bother me to take her in
[1:30:41] the woods care up to the deer stand
[1:30:43] carry her sleeping Back Care up in the
[1:30:47] put up the sleeping bag
[1:30:49] let her get up in the tree and sit down
[1:30:51] and me wrap her up in a sleeping bag
[1:30:52] give her her gun load it far and
[1:30:55] everything and then me go off somewhere
[1:30:56] and lay down because let's give out
[1:31:00] that didn't bother me that's just a joke
[1:31:04] but we had a lot of fun doing that
[1:31:09] a lot of fun
[1:31:10] being a Christian and being Christian
[1:31:12] together can be a lot of fun
[1:31:14] she got to put a deer stand one day and
[1:31:18] I was going to straighten it up because
[1:31:19] it would lean in just a little or
[1:31:21] wouldn't stand up against the trick it
[1:31:23] wouldn't fasten too good but
[1:31:25] and I was going to just move it over
[1:31:27] straighten her out because she said this
[1:31:28] thing's leaning over well I caught the
[1:31:30] stand and pulled it well it did it went
[1:31:31] the other way and she's hanging off the
[1:31:33] stand this way
[1:31:35] and she was screaming
[1:31:37] I said hang on I'll get her and I pull
[1:31:39] her back and it goes to the other side
[1:31:40] now she's hanging off the other side
[1:31:43] of course
[1:31:45] we finally got it straightened up I said
[1:31:46] honey I think we might as well go home I
[1:31:50] don't think there's any deer in these
[1:31:52] Woods if it was they would over behind
[1:31:55] the tree going
[1:32:00] the just being
[1:32:02] right and doing what we're supposed to
[1:32:04] be
[1:32:05] right God doesn't expect anything out of
[1:32:08] you
[1:32:09] he just wants us to accept him
[1:32:13] and he can handle all things right let's
[1:32:15] stand together we come to the time of
[1:32:17] communion let's stand together and we'll
[1:32:19] have the communion
[1:32:21] and
[1:32:22] you know and I hope you understand my
[1:32:25] point
[1:32:27] the prophet said the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:29] Christ would be the fullness of the
[1:32:31] godhead bodily
[1:32:33] yeah but brother Dale I don't see how
[1:32:35] that could be well what's that got to do
[1:32:37] with it
[1:32:40] I don't understand
[1:32:44] how did I know a motor can pull a car
[1:32:48] down the highway and all of them things
[1:32:50] goes up and down and moves and
[1:32:52] everything
[1:32:53] I don't understand that do you
[1:32:56] it's the old saying is do you understand
[1:32:58] how did a brown cow eats Green Grass and
[1:33:02] gives white milk
[1:33:04] I've never met a chocolate cow yet
[1:33:08] is always white milk
[1:33:10] I don't understand that but you know
[1:33:12] what I don't stop drinking the milk
[1:33:18] I just believe God's warning is bride
[1:33:22] to see who she is
[1:33:26] and what she's here for
[1:33:29] he'll take care of the rest
[1:33:31] it'll all be in that part see just to
[1:33:33] try to be a Christian
[1:33:38] see we think and I said we think we've
[1:33:40] got to get rid of this we've got to do
[1:33:41] that and even brother Brown referred to
[1:33:43] at that time where the scripture said
[1:33:45] you know the man said watch him lest we
[1:33:47] do to be saved
[1:33:49] he said he asked what to do to be saved
[1:33:51] he said we tell them what to quit and
[1:33:52] what to do and what not to do he said
[1:33:54] that don't save you
[1:33:59] you quit all you want to do all you want
[1:34:00] to straighten up all you want to that'll
[1:34:02] save you
[1:34:04] it's when you can realize that you're
[1:34:05] lost
[1:34:08] realize it hey
[1:34:10] I have no hope without Jesus Christ
[1:34:15] I have no hopes whatsoever in this world
[1:34:18] outside of Christ
[1:34:21] and then he comes down and speaks to me
[1:34:24] and I just accept it
[1:34:26] amen say thank you
[1:34:28] thank you Lord let's read the scripture
[1:34:30] we're going into the communion
[1:34:35] First Corinthians 11 23 for I have
[1:34:37] received of the Lord
[1:34:39] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:34:41] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:34:43] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:34:45] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:34:46] said take eat for this is my body which
[1:34:49] is broken for you this doing remembers
[1:34:51] of me after the same manner also we took
[1:34:54] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:34:56] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:34:57] just do years often as you drink it in
[1:35:00] remembrance of me very as often as you
[1:35:02] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:35:04] sure the Lord's debt till he come
[1:35:06] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:35:09] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:35:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:35:12] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:35:14] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:35:17] that bread and drink of that cup or he
[1:35:19] doesn't eat us and drinketh unworthily
[1:35:20] eat it and drink a damnation to himself
[1:35:23] not Discerning the Lord's body but this
[1:35:25] caused many a weak and sickly among you
[1:35:27] and many sleep for we would judge
[1:35:29] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:35:31] when we are judged we are chasten of the
[1:35:34] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:35:35] with the world or for my brethren when
[1:35:38] you come together to eat Tyree one for
[1:35:40] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:35:43] eat at home that you come not together
[1:35:44] under condemnation and the rest will I
[1:35:47] said in order
[1:35:48] when I come amen
[1:35:51] rest well I said in order
[1:35:54] when it's all finished and all over with
[1:35:58] do we come to the time of taking the
[1:36:00] communion and we don't believe in that
[1:36:02] being the literal body or a literal
[1:36:04] blood
[1:36:05] thank you we believe it's a in
[1:36:09] representation
[1:36:12] it's in representation of the body and
[1:36:14] blood
[1:36:16] y all right then we take it as believing
[1:36:20] that we are Christians
[1:36:24] and thanking God for the word and the
[1:36:27] truth
[1:36:28] and loving him forever
[1:36:30] the thanks
[1:36:32] not a treachery or a hateful life that
[1:36:35] we have to do
[1:36:37] no just let him do it
[1:36:41] you know you know you find out it's so
[1:36:42] easy
[1:36:47] you find out it's just so easy to just
[1:36:49] be yourself
[1:36:50] I like for people to be theirself with
[1:36:52] me I'd rather you just be honest with me
[1:36:56] than just sneak around and not be true
[1:36:58] it don't bother me if you tell me I
[1:37:00] don't like you
[1:37:01] well I don't like me either
[1:37:04] and that don't bother me
[1:37:06] it don't bother me to say I don't agree
[1:37:08] with you
[1:37:10] I said well okay let's sit down talk it
[1:37:12] over and see what the word says
[1:37:15] then we've got to agree with that
[1:37:18] in the communion is to that point see
[1:37:21] that's why Paul was chosen not any of
[1:37:23] the others to explain the communion from
[1:37:26] the Old Testament form
[1:37:28] in bringing it down when they got
[1:37:30] together and they ate the the calf you
[1:37:32] know and they were getting ready to
[1:37:33] leave Egypt and then they did there was
[1:37:35] just a little thing happened there that
[1:37:37] kind of set things in order that the
[1:37:39] Lord Jesus would eventually come
[1:37:41] and he would say these things
[1:37:44] to us
[1:37:46] this is my body
[1:37:49] which is broken for you
[1:37:51] just do in remembrance of me all right
[1:37:54] so then let's think about it and the
[1:37:56] Bible says it's a tarried For a Moment
[1:37:59] means just wait a little bit so let's
[1:38:01] just have a few moments of solid prayer
[1:38:03] breathing you know and praying and
[1:38:05] thanking the lord for what he's done for
[1:38:07] us
[1:38:09] in praying for one another is the main
[1:38:11] thing right
[1:38:29] just have your way with each one of us
[1:38:31] forgive our sins because we know that
[1:38:33] we're failures
[1:38:34] cleanse us Lord and make us worthy of
[1:38:36] this that we are to protect of
[1:38:39] in Jesus name
[1:38:43] the Bible said he took bread and he
[1:38:45] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:38:47] bread it's been made for this purpose
[1:38:49] today
[1:38:50] it's unleavened as we were speaking of
[1:38:52] it has nothing in it to make it any
[1:38:55] different because we're not supposed to
[1:38:56] do that
[1:38:57] but we're to believe and we're to thank
[1:38:59] you for these things and we just pray
[1:39:01] that you would sanctify the bread in
[1:39:03] each partaker in Jesus name
[1:39:11] you can see the reason that we do the
[1:39:13] breaking of the bread is because it was
[1:39:15] a broken body
[1:39:17] you know Charmed out that's that's their
[1:39:19] business I'm not argue with nobody I'm
[1:39:22] just saying that
[1:39:24] we believe that his body was broken for
[1:39:26] each one of us amen all right in that
[1:39:29] then we can look at it and say well
[1:39:32] thank you Lord
[1:39:33] you know let us each one now partake
[1:39:36] and we believe you that you will
[1:39:40] do as you say it
[1:39:44] we sent
[1:39:45] the communion home to a person one time
[1:39:48] that
[1:39:49] brother Gibby
[1:39:51] and
[1:39:53] I said just take it to his house and
[1:39:55] give him the communion because he was
[1:39:56] not able to be here
[1:39:58] and you know what
[1:39:59] God healed him right there
[1:40:03] I believe that you know I believe it
[1:40:05] happened
[1:40:07] because it was just
[1:40:09] what thoughts and ideas that we have or
[1:40:12] whatever
[1:40:13] was placed upon believing God and
[1:40:17] letting him manifest himself
[1:40:20] in a way that would be and the reason I
[1:40:22] like to break the bread is it was a
[1:40:25] broken body as I said a moment ago
[1:40:27] and it was done for you and I
[1:40:38] father we thank you for this wine it's
[1:40:40] been made for this purpose today and we
[1:40:43] just ask you to sanctify the wine and
[1:40:45] the partakers we know this is not your
[1:40:47] blood but it represents your blood and
[1:40:49] that's very close
[1:40:51] but yet it's not literal blood it's wine
[1:40:53] hard but it's in symbolics in the things
[1:40:57] that we do we ask you to just be with
[1:40:59] each one as we eat this little piece of
[1:41:01] bread and that's we drink this little
[1:41:03] cup of wine
[1:41:05] that even tomorrow it will be building
[1:41:07] blood cells in our body because that's
[1:41:09] the thing that you ordain for us to be
[1:41:12] so we pray that what we little we've
[1:41:14] heard today will grow tomorrow into a
[1:41:17] greater understanding
[1:41:19] a great tree of knowledge in you we love
[1:41:21] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[1:41:33] come morning
[1:41:36] oh
[1:41:38] by the river
[1:41:42] I'll rest knee
[1:41:44] the
[1:41:46] evergreen tree
[1:41:49] I don't care
[1:41:52] my cross
[1:41:54] through the midnight
[1:41:58] Come Morning the Earth Glory
[1:42:02] for me
[1:42:05] sometimes I'm
[1:42:07] despised and rejected
[1:42:12] and I question
[1:42:15] oh Father
[1:42:28] and it gives me the strength
[1:42:40] by the rivers
[1:42:43] I'll Rish me
[1:42:54] I promise
[1:43:06] you know you think about the children of
[1:43:08] Israel as they were leaving out of Egypt
[1:43:11] getting ready and
[1:43:13] heading towards the Promised Land
[1:43:17] the last thing they're doing
[1:43:19] was he got together they killed the lamb
[1:43:23] the none the ways that they were to do
[1:43:25] and
[1:43:26] they had a time together as a family and
[1:43:29] they are ate certain things and done
[1:43:33] certain things all of that was to show
[1:43:35] that they were fixing to make a journey
[1:43:38] well you know that
[1:43:41] time there lasted
[1:43:45] or held him
[1:43:47] as to be the people of God
[1:43:49] until they got into the Promised Land
[1:43:53] and you know then they begin to do
[1:43:55] different things
[1:43:57] it's a wonderful thing
[1:44:00] you know the last thing that they were
[1:44:03] doing was
[1:44:06] just honoring God and doing what he said
[1:44:11] well you know what he just honored them
[1:44:14] and the Bible says that her she was
[1:44:17] broke with their feet
[1:44:20] he said well that's impossible well
[1:44:22] that's right that's impossible
[1:44:25] but remember all things are possible to
[1:44:27] them that believe
[1:44:29] so that make you an unbeliever to
[1:44:31] believe that they didn't grow with her
[1:44:32] feet and didn't wear out
[1:44:34] you know
[1:44:35] that would be to you to believe
[1:44:39] but I believe it I believe that
[1:44:41] everything was provided they had Manna
[1:44:44] to eat
[1:44:45] they had all of the things taken care of
[1:44:48] and what about a vitamin that you could
[1:44:51] come up with that
[1:44:52] man you could just eat one little old
[1:44:55] vitamin and
[1:44:56] and be able to live and and they just
[1:44:59] went out and picked a little up off of
[1:45:01] the ground because it came overnight you
[1:45:03] know
[1:45:04] and they just picked it up took it home
[1:45:06] and baked it and it had ever nutrition
[1:45:11] there was no cholesterol
[1:45:13] there was no high blood pressure you
[1:45:16] know
[1:45:16] there was no nothings in all of the
[1:45:19] whole thing
[1:45:20] because
[1:45:22] that was God's Manna they called it
[1:45:25] but you know what I love about it
[1:45:27] because it was done because they take
[1:45:29] some of that then when they got into the
[1:45:31] promised land and the man of seas to
[1:45:33] fall
[1:45:34] and they took some
[1:45:36] and they put it in the pot and put it
[1:45:39] into the holy of holies well you know
[1:45:40] every new priest he was allowed to go in
[1:45:44] and he was allowed to
[1:45:46] take a piece of that
[1:45:48] manner
[1:45:51] you know
[1:45:53] of the original
[1:45:55] and it was never gone out
[1:45:59] it's always perfect
[1:46:01] let's just all partake together
[1:46:16] you can be seated as we get ready reader
[1:46:18] scripture and finish up
[1:46:21] John 13.
[1:46:25] and supper being handed to devil having
[1:46:27] now put into the heart of Judas this
[1:46:28] character Simon's son do betray him
[1:46:32] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:46:33] all things into his hand and did he come
[1:46:35] from God and went to God he rises when
[1:46:37] supper and laid aside his garments what
[1:46:39] about the last thing he was doing before
[1:46:41] his crucifixion
[1:46:45] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:46:47] all things into his hands and he was
[1:46:48] come from God and went to God
[1:46:50] he rises from supper and light aside his
[1:46:52] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:46:53] himself after that he poured water into
[1:46:55] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:46:57] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:46:59] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:47:01] to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him
[1:47:03] Lord this thou washed my feet you know
[1:47:06] you're not supposed to do that
[1:47:08] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:47:10] do to I know it's not now
[1:47:13] but thy shalt know you're after
[1:47:16] you know this last Pope he's kind of got
[1:47:18] in trouble you know what
[1:47:20] he washed somebody's individual's feet
[1:47:24] well see that was taboo as far as the
[1:47:26] upper-ups are supposed to do you know
[1:47:28] because he wasn't supposed to mingle
[1:47:29] with the commoners well he's doing it
[1:47:31] he's going out and mingling and you know
[1:47:33] and doing all things you know because
[1:47:35] he's just a human being
[1:47:38] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:47:40] wash my feet Jesus answered him of
[1:47:42] course thee not thus no part with me
[1:47:43] Simon Peter saith unto him see caught on
[1:47:46] not but my feet on it but also my hands
[1:47:50] and my head the two dirtiest things
[1:47:52] about him that he could figure but what
[1:47:55] did Jesus say back to him Jesus saith
[1:47:57] unto him he that is worse needeth not
[1:47:59] saved to wash his feet but is clean
[1:48:01] everywhere and you're clean but not all
[1:48:03] for he knew who should betray him
[1:48:04] therefore said he you are not all clean
[1:48:06] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:48:09] had taken his garments and was sat down
[1:48:10] again he said unto them know you what
[1:48:12] I've done to you you call me master and
[1:48:14] Lord and you say well for so I am if I
[1:48:17] then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:48:19] your feet you also ought to wash one
[1:48:21] another's feet for I've given you an
[1:48:23] example that you should do as I have
[1:48:24] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[1:48:27] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:48:30] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:48:33] that sent him if you know these things
[1:48:36] happy are you if you do them
