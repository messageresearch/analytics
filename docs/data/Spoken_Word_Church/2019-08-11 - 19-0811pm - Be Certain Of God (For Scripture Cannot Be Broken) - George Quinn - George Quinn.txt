it's good to be back again praise God I don't mean preaching twice hallelujah I don't mind just to say a word for the Lord and wonderful thank you for the privilege brother Samuel if doing it today Amen in this church here that we love you today praise God the Lord bless you everyone amen today and I was telling our young brother here that led the part of the service the song service now brother Branham said God loves good singing he loves good saying is for brother quarterdeck we enjoyed your good singing today mom we enjoy and enjoy the song service and God bless you all today amen 9 if I can get this right we will certainly turn to the scripture it away praise the Lord yes it's come up and I've got a boot it says 16 percent left amen but ain't going I ain't going and going the tablet I like to keep with the paper so a man but I can read at least this so perhaps if we could stand and we'll read the scriptures today amen and may I say this up in North Carolina brother Joe Greene has a sayin where he says now I will change the order of the service so we're going to come to a point in this message and we will change the order of the service so just be ready for that amen ok and he says here and 1 chapter 1 I sorry 1st Kings 17 we know the story so well and prison Lord will read from verse 9 to 16 and it says and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Sara paths which belongeth to Zidan and dwell there behold I have commanded a with a woman there to sustain me that's wonderful so he arose and went to zaraba and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called her and said me I pray thee a little water and a vessel a Mian that I may drink praise God my knees are almost like jelly reading nut amen praise God and as she was going to fetch it hallelujah bless our holy heart he called her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in my hand and she said as the Lord loveth I have not a kick but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it on to me after that make thee for thy son for thus saith the Lord thus said the Lord God amen the barrel of meal shall not whisk neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent Etrian upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many deaths and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crucible fill according to the word of the Lord which he did speak by Alicia now there's two other scriptures there probably here I might have to turn around and read them myself of this board my battery goes down but I'll try my best here to get up first and it's the next one is a Luke 4 and you'll probably be there before I am but but we will try praise the Lord and Luke chapter 4 amen now we know this this scripture so well produce God but I want to read just a few verses of it chapter 4 amen if we get and we're getting there night chapter 4 praise the Lord and we're going to go read up to let me say where we start amen and he came to Nazareth verse 16 where he had been brought up on as the custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read under was delivered unto him the Book of Isaiah the prophet are the prophetess and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he given again to the minister and sat dine all the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen on our last little reading I'm sure the brothers again will probably get there before I do but you'll see it up there it's in John's Gospel praise God because this is hard I'm gonna link it all in today amen and John's Gospel tonight we know we're very familiar with John chapter 10 so you might be thinking I'm gonna preach about the Good Shepherd holding some wonderful message if I did but I'm not a man for his God so we're gonna read away by at the end toward the end of it hallelujah and I'll cut in here and verse 34 you could read more if you wanted but time being time he said jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said year gods and if he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father have sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemous because I said I am the son of God if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though ye believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him amen and the Lord out his blessing to the reading of his were to let us just have a short prayer Christmas Lord we thank you Lord as we stepped over to this pulpit we could feel the pulsating power of the Holy Ghost and we pray Lord as the people are anticipation of the word Lord that you will meet their anticipation not a mine Lord put me aside use my lips use my voice is my thoughts use everything about us Lord because we surrender all to you and Lord we pray that we'll go to this house blessed in our soul today and we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen and you may be seated prison or hallelujah many things you could say praise God many things you could say and I've often thought about it that if you've got an hour it's just coming on 222 nine just before if you've got an R to say something no matter how you say it or who says it you can only get so many words in as they're so many so so therefore pretty Scott there's many thoughts you have to Levite and things say and I think brother Joe can fly shop there that the family that I was telling you about this morning in India if he condor might just come up in a moment and yes there this that's that moment unheard three daughters and her son was on the other side that's so when i was talking to you but that got converted to Jesus Christ over in India and November and I'm so glad and I will be going to their village again this year and I've never been to it before but when I go back I I hope I hope that if they haven't been baptized they'll be there to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I really do hallelujah amen it's nice to have a sweet tooth if anybody told you they don't have a sweet tooth you really wouldn't believe them with you hey man I pop up in cars well I shouldn't even say the southern Virginia I was in brother Ronald slice and he made the coffee because he knows I like coffee and and he had one of these what is it crispy crossed across Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and he had a box of them and so he said would you like would you like a donut I and sister Connie said brother George might wanna do not you know and I said I don't really mind you know and no one said oh I don't know you know that's okay so she said is that okay I said yes right so we had the coffee in the donut and Ronald turned her and he said the economy if I was as thin as home he said I'd eat the whole box well I don't nobody eating the whole box brother Wade you know I don't know who that but we do have a sweet tooth you know but the Bible says thy word was sweet on to mightiest the Word of God is so sweet - artists it's not hard to eat it it's not hard to absorb it as a blessing to our soul to our body to our spirit and we thank God for it no uh you know we all have favorite messages that brother Branham preached amen and I went back from the way at the beginning amen I like that message to be certain of God because you know really and truly we all want to be certain of God you know and brother Branham says that a prison Lord he said you know but God's people are always been in a minority and that's true all through you know when you got all the prophets of veal you only got one Elijah to face them up it's always been in a minority no matter what were you go why you do it and and he said that's the way that's the way it is amen and praise the Lord but they're still God's chosen and elected people amen and so we're thankful for that but he also goes on to say this ain't this was 1959 the quotes that I'm gonna give you before I changed the order of the service but he meant but it's a strange thing to me said how people that have accepted Christ is afraid to trust him I thought that there may be something that they're not sure of and not remained at me of the man that went across the Niagara Falls and they all watched him who if he falls he's dead and all that and he took over a wheel but of course he took off the rubber a man and he walked across the iron cable and he said to them this fella on the other side do you believe I could go back again he said yeah cuz thing you're doing of watching him do it twice and he said would you get into the wheel bar I let me with your over and he said no no you see so it's one thing to to trust and it's another thing to trust really trust amen where you are certain what I want to get the builders say Amen praise God and so he said that that that we would trust in the Lord Amen and I'd be certain that it's God that he said it he'll back it up amen so prison the Lord when we read Tony amen and you know I'm not going to preach all of that message I'm just going to highlights of it and he's talking about not that morning this is what I'm saying about a vision that in my life I can sit down and look at that morning see the morning see seinen are not bald the gate of the city a little tired not a big massive city a man like Galante just a small little almost like have the leads and there I can see this little woman brother Samuel could Christ over you know poor not very well dressed you know hungry then a month's appear because she had been a starvation situation amen that famine was on and you can just see her there and he said why was that why was that all the problems and I would say this sincerely with all my heart that sometimes people blame God they blame God it's God's fault for everything amen but it's not God's fault it's mom's fault it's mine it gets away even when you look and I'm not gonna preach in it even when you look at when they went into the Promised Land God said I'll Drive the might amen before you but they still let them stay in the lines where he said tell them all but they didn't and before you know what they're living together and before you know what Israel is worshiping the gods of the killer nights so that wasn't God's fault he said I'll do it if you believe it amen so praise God that's the way it is and here they were the moral decay of the mission and brother Branham said ezreal was loved by God and when they got rid of the will of God the enemy took them over and they shouldn't do it so God loves his church but when they got hurt of the will of God and the denominations and then I see a car so they're walking away they're walking away from the truth they're walking away from the word and what's it going to bring judgment that's all it can bring hallelujah and Ahab was a king of Israel at the time and they might thinking he was the most wicked King a brother Branham says that it's true that Israel ever had because he married an idolater right in the face and frontage of God saying well I'm going to have this woman because iiiii like her I don't wouldn't say he loved her but he said I like her and she's a pretty and all that I never mentioned that she is an idol worshiper that she's gonna worship bill and she's gonna introduce bill to the people and my so that's what brought the moral decay onto the mission because brother Branham said that this is what the people this is what the people do amen if if the King does it would end the people follow it amen so pretty god hallelujah will if you want to follow anything if you want an example of anything praise the Lord follow your postures example if you want to follow on in follow brother branham's example how he lived you say I want to live like that you'll not be far off the mark I can tell you that you'll not be far of the mark amen and so praise the Lord you know and he led the country and a idolatry and you know that story very quickly I put a burden a birth one day he said well I'd like to have more than I've got so here's a nice vineyard I think I'll have it an even turn in a bark and he takes out his billfold he says how much do you want for urine hurt ins a neighbor said I can't sell you miners he said no no no I'm gonna borrow give you a good price he said you don't understand mr. King he said I can't sell that in hurtings I'm a man and what happened was he went he went away sorrowful and there he goes up and he's sitting there make a big spoiled baby and his palace and Jezebel come said what's wrong with you know they both certainly took me dirty wouldn't sell me as it hurts you know you're the king of Israel he said you leave it with me I'll get it and she did she got it all right praise God she got it all right amen and false witnesses the pernais boss was stoned and he got the inheritance but that's when the Prophet turned up and said thus saith the Lord hallelujah because you've done that the dogs will drink your blood they'll say they lick your blood up hallelujah and she was judged as well amen amen they threw her out of the window praise God so you can't do that folks amen you just can't do that Prince the Lord under and get away with it amen and so a brother Branham said that that's a picture of our country he's talking about America but I'm telling you the picture of every country Amen hallelujah like I said today open Canada to talking about dog having more rights but our our our Prime Minister we call him t-shirt here SJ openly gay and he's smart until northern mine died because they brought in the law and young people in Ireland they just say well you know we don't care if you want to do not go ahead you know whether they believe it or not some of them believe it many of them don't but did you say live and let live and all that so it was voted in but when he went to Canada he was not going to take his partner with him but the Trudeau the young Trudeau he said bring your partner it's okay your Marty to him it's alright I'm there in the state banquets and all up in Canada and the Irish flag that can hit him flagged all starting there there's this partner it beside him just right open now when you get it open like that hallelujah I tell you what praise God I even if you even if he read Romans 1 I don't think I'm doing any good amen so you know it's a picture of our land as well as America amen hard hard we will get into the situation we are and it's no surprise to us that religion is on the decline and it will keep going that way amen and you'll see more and more as you go on Souls in prison you will see them they'll be there and they will not get right amen they've made their their final decisions so brother brother said whatever you put before God it's an idol amen let it be whatever it is maybe and remember he was great when he was not a Christian he used to polished in a Sunday he used to polish this a car till it was literally polished away he loved that that was his idol he didn't realize it but that was his idol hallelujah and then when he got to himself later on he said my imagine do not much impulsive every year what about 20 years from now if you could go back 20 years and see what you drove and you heard it the day well you would have almost like a heap of junk that's so it's not a very good angle Amen I was telling the folks that over and they and their big football stadium there's one one club in England and they've got it's called Chelsea's the area and the football club there and they said Chelsea is our religion and I said well it's not I told my people are citizens a very pure religion very pure religion because of you ER and the ICU Amy and since L sees my religion ain't gonna help you one iota you are gonna need a living God you are gonna need someone who can preach and pray the prayer of faith for you I said you're gonna need not not just that I'm gonna do nothing for you praise God so anything you put before God is an idol amen and you know grit material things don't always rest in the will of God if God gives you them he can trust you with them no right but they don't they don't prove you know if you've got three Cadillacs or for them don't prove that you're a better Christian than anybody else praise God somebody has to take the public transport don't prove nothing amen Prince God so amen and you know brother Joe he likes this kind of thing maybe you'll take this one down put it somewhere I don't know but he said what we need today is not a lot a lot of material things we have that he said what we needed is be more spiritual amen more spiritual praise God and that's what we need today to spend more time with the Lord and to be more spiritual that our main thing on spiritual things the spiritual mind and the spiritual mind has attracted to God can't help it hallelujah is just attracted to God you know you don't say oh I better eat my Bible why because it could always read my Bible make every day know it's attracting you to get something out of it like a honey bee you know the honey's there you want something you want God to speak to you want something to be done hallelujah and so Prince the Lord we need to be spirit soul amen it probably looked this one up he can do because it's there and we need to be spirit so as a person that will humble themselves so spritzel and humble and you don't press have you ever get someone standing up and saying I've got a testimony I'm so humble you know don't believe them don't believe them because you don't you're not going to say that humility and something that works certain your life what people would say that's a homeless in there but you don't preach it because they'll say well that's afraid to say that then your humble just think you know what I mean don't ya and then he says praise God and he says a person that will humble themselves before God even if they haven't a penny and we'll pray we'll pray you gotta pray hallelujah say brother George I don't have much time look if you're stopped at the traffic light hallelujah if you're having your coffee break I know one brother brother uh Samuel was learned in the factory in the Chevrolet we Pike years ago and they used to get together with their bricks and everything they got and pray and read the scriptures not right you saw a brother taking your mom dimness Prince God's Way just did not got together the different brothers that were there and not that factory hey man you can pray you can make a place to pray hallelujah and it doesn't have to be many long prayers could you imagine when Peter was sinking you'd say now what I think what should I pray here and he's sinking in the water yeah yeah maybe it was you know but he cried out he said lord save me hey man that's all he needed to do say pray until the spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God of all the things that I'm satisfied with it's the goodness of God and you gotta believe to see that in the land of the living and then he says a revival takes place and said your heart amen that little spring is welling up within you and it's bubbling away and it can't be suppressed it'll keep bubbling up every day buh buh buh buh buh buh I'm not little revival will take place in your heart and in your life and said your heart I'm not changes your attitude and that changes your atmosphere and I believe that praise God that your atmosphere is everything that you take with you amen and live in that atmosphere every day so here we are amen God will never be pleased I'd say an entire sanctified before heaven amen and so that's it when it's cleaned but you know it's cleaned it's emptied it separately under God but you still need that Holy Spirit to come and you still need that new birth amen that you've got that Nitzer that devayne heavenly Nitzer in you amen and in me hallelujah praise God and that's what we want this little woman she had to be of the same caliber as Elijah because usually Direction shows what you are it's not true because you know your actions speak louder than your words they really do so I'd rather see someone act then talk a lot amen praise God you could almost get in a joke of a Texas there but I'll leave that I think you could follow that as well but anyway and she must have been of the same caliber because usually your action speaks again what shows what you are and she was chosen to entertain God's prophet remember she was a Gentile not Jew and the line was burning up no dirt this little woman bit of that caliber like a believer type 4 we see that God would not have called her if she hadn't have been worthy hallelujah and she had not been worthy to entertain one of his prophets praise God he would never have sent its profit to a house that was unworthy but she was worthy hallelujah and you are worthy because he comes to your house every day hallelujah every day every minute of every day he's with you in your house a man and why because he's proved that you're worthy he's got confidence in you amen and he's there hallelujah and that's a wonderful thing amen and and surely amen it wasn't Elijah's he only had the vision it wasn't his thinking or even choosing perhaps but it was God's choosing it wasn't him or harboring him it was God bidding him and he had placed by the brook it had fed the Ravens but it dried up and then God says go darling for I have commanded a widow woman to feed you I'd love to know heart God commanded her to do that but he did come on her to do that amen hallelujah and so we're so thankful for that not today this little story amen and God surely went to a believer of the same nature as Elijah brother Samuel said builder even in her we were talking and some what is with her he said dude there's things that we believe the same as brother branham even before we knew the message because God was in us the god of brother Branham was in us we were of the same nature hallelujah we are still to this day hallelujah he doesn't speak in tongues to us we know what he's saying amen and so thank God for that hallelujah the same nature as Elijah amen and please God I want to give into this little things cuz you're a little few nuggets here that I wanna before it changed the course of the of the message amen and he said perhaps she prayed all night long I and she she could take look at the pale lips of her little boy about three or four years old and she could see her own bones don't know where's the flesh was gonna off them and it must have been a terrible thing as that as her mother I seen this good on and yet her hands before God pray night and day Amen hallelujah and we're down to one handful of mail on a spoonful of oil you know I think somewhere that brother brother brother said when you get to the end of your rope just tie a knot and hold on that's a good idea just hold on don't give up don't give up if God said it it'll happen and I'll show you why these things happen well you know there's wouldn't you get really to know the nature of God you know you find it he's a person Jesus Christ is a person he was here on the earth he knows what you need amen could you imagine coming to your door if someone said you and a half are the lord of the coming to your door and Jesus himself appeared amen and you invaded a man and he said Sternin your home amen and he's sitting there and you're saying the Lord but would you like something to drink or what and he sure sure whatever you're sharing with him and then he may turn around do you say no you were praying last night and this is what you asked for and he'll tell you what you ask for oh brother I'll tell you wouldn't be beautiful gonna be wonderful hallelujah and he was set you read and when he left I'll tell you you'd be more than ten foot time you would be Wow hallelujah Oh nobody could touch you a man so here she was and amen he said you know it's a strange thing it's a strange thing praise God that the Lord does that amen and amen most streams that sometimes that God does it that way that he just tries you rate down to the end what's the next stop Lennie death death oh but you said there that you told the family that God would give you a dream or whatever way that he was going to sell a property to you I did but if that profit don't come I'm dead it's as simple as that amen and she was just looking to see what was going to happen I'm just willing praise God and so he said God likes to do it sometime like that you know when you've confessed your sin and unmet every requirement of God you believe in God the circumstances had been met that's according to as well you've confessed her sins and we've all made wrongs that we that we did okay you make it right and every requirement and yet he still is silent oh my it seems that he's not answering your prayer you know sometimes we pray for years and years for our prayer to be answered amen that's why we must never give up folks because when the angel Gabriel I love this when the angel Gabriel appeared to Zechariah in the temple the first thing he said to him was thy prayer is heard and Zachariah didn't know what he was talking about no you don't you're gonna I would say oh no no it couldn't be that prayers are you doing it whoever you are you tuned him I fasted my wife's boss said no no no I didn't say that I said your prayer has heard when he planted somewhere years back God heard it and now here was the fulfillment of the prayer hallelujah that is wonderful amen God likes to do that hallelujah amen and I here you are and you've met every requirement and he still won't move he seems to be silent he said that is when you've got to be sure of God you've got to be sure yes God said it hallelujah mine you know I was listening to DL moody and not listen to the deal middle Paco's reading about the element hey man praise God he didn't make many CDs but but but when he was dying and he's gone in another dimension and seeing people and all out there and his daughter said or dad's you know your daydreamin he said I'm not ready man said it's real hallelujah this is my coronation day this is mother paulie's here's a priest this is my coronation day and it was hallelujah you know my you know with Charles hundun Spurgeon died and he said a lovely thing he said don't and the day of Charles Darwin Spurgeon said don't try to fit the Bible to fit the inch and they tried to do that the Catholic Church says oh they were scientists must be right we must have been all evolved from a frog or something God whatever you know some kind of what the Catholic Church went along with it run along with darlin hope Darwin said it everybody believes it what must be true I'll tell you one thing charge silent Spurgeon didn't say that he fought at hallelujah and he said don't you try to to fit the Bible to the edge he said you fit the edge to the Bible and that's why we know where we're up today because we affinity ears to the Bible to God's Word that makes more sense doesn't not amen and so Prince God hallelujah amen and he said when he he won't move it seems he sat silent that's when you got to be sure he's God he said don't be discouraged the only thing to do is that in your heart you know be certain of God hallelujah amen and he says make that text when you don't ever even met everything you're sure he's God he said that's when faith kicks in my God has declared in his word decreed in his word that as by faith you get everything I mean you know if you go into the gas station and of course I have to do it and money you probably do it with your card but the thing is you know you pay the price hallelujah and that's the currency that's what you pay in truth God amen your own currency well the currency of heaven is faith if you're going to get anything by faith you'll get it that's right I'm telling you that is right hallelujah praise God and that's that's been decreed by God for my faith that you see if that by grace you see it through faith and that's not even of yourself it's a gift of God hallelujah so amen that's when Fiat kicks in right there when you're just it's like jube amen and and he furthered his friends weren't his friends and trying to condemn him instead of putting her arm and saying look god bless you amen oh no praise the Lord and so here they were amen and just when his faith kicked in and he saw that vision hallelujah all minor demon levels my Redeemer liveth I don't care how long do you wait honey body says I see at night hallelujah one day I'll stand on the earth even though this gentleman sickness and my flesh I will see God now you just underline not til I get the part be of the sermon just underline that hey man praise God and so yeah faith goes to work amen and praise God God's only test in your faith praise the Lord he's not testing your billfold he's testing your faith praise God and and you know the Prophet said he loves to do that because he's a God feel he believed its own word let there be light and there was they believed this that there must be something wonderful and the spoken word where even a prophet could say and let a squirrel up here right there on that brunch on woman´s there and he should sit down what a wonderful thing the spoken word of God that'll do that amen God said let there be light and there was light it's wonderful hallelujah praise the Lord so God loves to test your faith whoo sometimes we don't love him to test our faith but he still loves to do it hey man and his words true amen he's obliged to take care of his word I love that you said it praise God you said Lord we wouldn't we wouldn't he wouldn't suffer us to be beggars he wouldn't suffer us the bad breath my goodness folks I'll tell you what though you could go on and on he loves to see the reaction of your faith how you'll react and jump gone I mean on even the brothers if you could put yourself in that little little condition Oh hope sings is gone you're picking up your last couple of sticks to belittle another fire cook uh a little kick for your little son who's a monster period you ever see one of them things on advertisement and the little things over and bullying I'm out riggan countries their pure little arms is about the thickness of your thumb hey man and they'll say if he doesn't get food he's gonna die he's gonna die my children have died today in Africa like that praise God and here she is and you put yourself there and you know and God's looking down on it just like the Jews butchering them them them the Germans butchering them them Jewish people hallelujah but they had to do it that was this further on them hallelujah that was the gentle hand of Jehovah what's going to get them back to the land and and they never leave the line hallelujah when I was over there I'll tell you this I could tell you many a story but over there but one day just before we left we were in on and it's like a place where they've got all the different shops and you can see like Joshua and Caleb carrying the big grits and all through you get all that quite expensive some of them and I don't know you know I love to be led by the Holy Spirit I love to ask the Holy Spirit to even you know come down the highway yesterday I had a little lunch just a gentle late lunch and I'm saying to God you show me the place you tell me what to eat that's how much confidence I've got on him because I know he knows better than I do praise God amen and so praise the Lord he were coming and I said to my wife I'm looking in this shop and I said let's go in here so I went and there's a little Jewish maybe about 55 60 so morally good and I'm hello he said you man have a look around no go ahead so we're looking right and I came and I saw this model of the temple and I said do you mean the file he said no go ahead and I left it always having just about that says there and you can see the temple in the wall ruin it and the temple that Jesus would have come into and praise God I looked at the price and I said oh dear oh dear and you know something he looked over at me and he said I'll tell you what I'll do and I said what do you what would you do he said I'll give you that for half-price and I said really he said really I said why why would you give me that hot price he said it's the holiday I said that's good enough for me I said just one second before actually clinched the deal just on my computer I'm a tablet they're got the price there was about 20 something sterling and I said that's that's that's good that's fame and I've got it in my house it's actually pointing East Amen the way the temple was and do you know something there's times brother Samuel well when the Sun shines and yet you can actually see right through the door and you think you can see the little pillar fire inside a man pretty high amen they asked me will we get our third temple I said you'll get your third temple don't worry about that Prince God whatever it is hallelujah and so God loves to see the reaction to your faith and amen that's true but you know something that's why you can have confidence in you have you considered my servant job but you know something your faith will always bring a reaction from God and I'll challenge you that on today praise God I will challenge you that on today because there's no time where you can have faith in God where you'll not get a reaction what'd he say oh I believe it on the heart and they never said nothing no no no no if you've got that genuine Holy Ghost faith amen it'll bring a reaction you say ah but brother that's not for hire no no no a little woman that had that issue she said look whatever happened have I can even touch His garment I'll be healed and you know Peter said well you you're said who touched me and all these people pushing and shoving Wow he said somebody touched me somebody touched me and they touched me by faith hallelujah and they were healed glory to God Oh faith will always bring the reaction from God hey man I if you're sure of God God is sure of his word there you have it amen so here she was and amen the bar holds all day and everything's dying no doubt the little boy would have died first hallelujah and here he was that God was letting it get that way he just loves to do that hallelujah and he loves to put your faith to test to see how you'll react how you'll act on at Amen and Joe was right he said even if he slays me I'm gonna trust I love that praise God that's the way to do it amen and so amen hallelujah let me see when jube was tried you know it even feel horrible trial but this is what I'll say you can come up here today and say brother George I'm going through a terrible trial and you could tell me what it is amen and I'll say well at the end of it God will bring you it and bless you twice fold three times fold than you ever were before that trial that is thus saith the Lord that's what he will do he won't try you Amen that you cannot bear it cuz he said he will not do that he will not test you but what you're able but when he's tested you and you come true hallelujah say that was a hard time I went through there may be someone in hospital or something I see you whatever praise God but when you come true it I'll tell you you watch and you'll see it'll bless you twice as much the same as he did with you nuts his ready works amen praise the Lord okay a man is to see him amen praise God God doubled up back he

and she turned and she she looked at him amen and you know brother Branham and another player said when she was picking up the sticks she saw his shadow on the ground and and she turned round and here's this kind looking all mine you know what brother Branham was Prince an indictment you couldn't stand in front of that amen but if you'd met brother Branham in a private interview I can tell you you would haven't date almost bouncing out of the place he gives you the end of you praise God you think it's enough to see a man in a prison Damon it is and here was this came looking old gentlemen

worse he lived at zero path nothing's much changed there's a mire bicha but the quarters of a mile long and I'm sure he walked up and down that many a day praying and worshiping God and a hub did not know where he was you know and it's the same with Israel when they get on the moon uh Sinai amen Anderson it is I believe it's in save Israel but when they get there the Antichrist will not know where they are amen praise God so that's going to be a wonderful thing - hallelujah amen and praise the Lord give me a drink of water the water of life we need that I'm gonna mention it in a little moment amen but praise God and and she had heard the voice of Elijah the Prophet oh my what a wonderful thing when you look round and hear the voice of Elijah amen he's on the same night hallelujah something

to the climax I know well hallelujah and when he said that give me that little kick first amen and I'm gonna bring something that seems to be so unusual about this thing and he said are you willing to give it into my hands my life all that I am he said I'm 54 years of its are you were willing William Branham to live all on me hallelujah praise the Lord are you willing your little children to lay your life to me are you willing can you do it sick people can you trust me can you put me first and see what happens I know I was talking to a precious sister and she was saying about you know is it okay do you think to see a doctor said amen praise God what's what's wrong to see a doctor hallelujah nothing amen brother gone instead of good doctors worth its weight in gold but praise God don't put the doctor first but God first hallelujah because he can do far more than the doctor can do for you never forget that hallelujah okay night is this true is this true or not it always seems what we have need of is what he asks for oh my what you've need you know you say that Lord look I mean I've got two cars here so you can have one I'll keep the other one no no that's what you think you have neat off he asks for it praise God hallelujah I'll give you this short illustration when I was I didn't go to college and it was great it was a missionary College and I spent a good 18 months and not college two years with her and and I cut my heart prepared for the mission fail but we used to have missionaries coming in from all over the place you know all George didn't make a grid a grid search planter open they're open Peru and the questions and all and all right okay that'd be nice you know and you know there was one thing that God fought me on and that was India that was India prince of all princes India boy I just hid it in there you know I wasn't going to go to India no Lord I'll go anywhere on up but not India don't you even ask me to go to India well that's how you praise God and that's what I'm saying the thing that they're holding on to is the thing he's just sent her but that's what I'm asking you do but Lord they're so dirty and poor and you know I don't want to go there he said that's what I'm asking you do and so I fought not it for a long time and then when I came to my surrender day at that point he said I don't want you to go to India but you must be prepared to go anywhere where I send you that's the whole key say that's exactly right brother Samuel is it not amen hallelujah I'm so pretty bad amen you know the story you know the story of brother Branham redditor he said he read it in a book or something about bartimaeus Islam you mean that the trend of that alarm and it was his eyes and he I love that little story Prince God it's just a little story and in fact it may not be you know but it's such a lovely little story that it could really would be in fact and so here he had this little arm trained to lead him ride and it was great and and he had a couple of little turtle doves and he was playing from birth and a little line with Lydia and Wow his daughter got sick and he said Lord of your healer I'll give you these two long at least three two dove so she was healed and he offered the two doves and sacrificed to God and then somebody else gets sick real sick real pardon to Diane and the family and he said Lord he said if you heal I think it may have been his daughter I'm not sure he said in the book but he said if you healed my daughter he said I'll give you the slap my my my and you know his daughter was healed and he's there and he's blind she do you realize what you've said you're going to give him your house you've got to give me a ride what are you gonna do and he said I promise I'm gonna do it all God loves that God loves you to keep your promise because he'll keep his yes sir and so he's gone up to the temple planed and this little arm leading him up to the temple he meets a priest and the priest says we're ghosts I bought a Miss or a priest I'm going up to the temple to offer this love no no no no you can't do that that's that's your eyes said I'll tell you what we'll do we've got funds I'll buy your lamb it'll need all the Lord's conditions and go ahead and sacrifice that and the Lord lets out that I'm sure it'd be wonderful he said mr. priest thank you appreciate that he said but I didn't promise God any other alarm he said I promised him the slap he said but that's your eyes he said I promised him this loud and so there was bartimaeus he wasn't even worried or thinking about how he was going to get home and here he is hallelujah offers his little lamb and on the way home hallelujah what does he mean he meets the Lamb of God hallelujah and he gets his healing body kisses eyes back that's the way God works folks that's the person of God that is the way he works oh it's wonderful hallelujah amen always seems what we have need of is what would be awesome us like that's little woman but this is the last one she don't murder you give it to me do you trust them that much yes well okay hallelujah okay she turns little bit since Amen you can look at Abraham he was to see him but I'm not gonna go into it because our times flying right here you know Abraham Wow what a fate he hard to get ayzik how many God as he can he's a bit 14 or so God says now I want you to do take him up to make my round sacrifice what I mean I thought when I got him not was that there's the CDs and prayers hallelujah every blast thing will come true I'm now here asking me to sacrifice them I'll tell you he picked you during that rule hey man if they turn down roads but Prince God when you bang trust and obey you know when King Saul captured the other king and he captured all his property you know he didn't sacrifice all the shape and when Samuel Kim he said what meaneth the bleeding of the sheep oh well I was going to sacrifice him I'm really holy I was going to sacrifice them to the Lord Allah he said to obey is better than sacrifice well hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah I don't have to do that by the way I'm from the better Prisca hallelujah hey man where is God so Amen my sheep know my voice well I wouldn't see her dog voices Elijah she said no because on the scene here maybe this is what what would it would he showed me hallelujah and he said bring me that little cake and she turns in a vision that's what you got to do in obedience amen and see what returns to her life Amen when you've turned and obeyed the Prophet praise God then the Thunder from heaven that every man looks to hear and that the Prophet raises up you can imagine brother Branham but he was standing there and appeared after hunting for ten days or so and I'm just sticking out along this head tilted over a little bit and said thus saith the Lord storm go back to your place hallelujah Oh here amen and he says to this woman thus said the Lord hallelujah not the septal idea that means nothing thus saith the Lord the God of the light job hallelujah on my heart we long to hear that how we long to hear that thus said the Lord the borrower will not update know the crews dry until God has sent Rhian on the earth what a consolation that's he made what a consolation and she give that key to the prophet and went back and he said you will drink amen you and your son and you'll live in your family until all is restored back on the earth and not let a woman her thankful she was for a god of Elijah and one day you'll meet her hallelujah one day you'll meet her you know truth is the truth and I'm just about to change the order of the service in a moment but truth is the truth praise God you cannot change truth amen No hallelujah I didn't bring that water it's inside there but if I hold up water let a little bottle of water now some of there may be ting ting one that I saw singing here today if I ask him what is the chemical of water probably they'll know it what it is but the chemical makeup of water is hitched to all three parts hydrogen one part oxygen makes them together you got water now that has never changed since water ever became water that has never changed and that will nurse him no you can go in and you can get lamb and put in your water or whatever not what you want pear put in your water you know just your water but Waters water i'ma let her be water because truth cannot change hallelujah truth is that which is according to the facts Amen according to the facts that's what we want not according done hearsay according to the facts hallelujah and praise God he said thy Word is truth what a consolation amen praise God and if you you know when you take him at his word burger bottom says this he said the gloomy times will not seem so gloomy the hard times will not seem so hard when take god I just worked No hallelujah listen just take him at his word be certain of God why why because thus said the Lord and scripture on Scripture has thus said the Lord the Word of God hallelujah 9 when we read when we read John and we saw that Jesus said about their law that you were gods we believe that Moses was God to them and brother branham was good to us but he spoke lost at the Lord hallelujah amen and so praise God he called them gods and from the word came to and the scripture cannot be broken now that is there that's the the fern ition we are not built on earth uh-uh-uh-uh-uh where it says a bottomless pit because it ain't got a foundation but we stand sure the word of the Lord is sure and it's a sure foundation and we can stand on it why because it can't be broken oh my would you like some more life ok I don't know yeah it can't be broken praise God you know it's on maintained and they came to where Jesus was they saw that he was dead already and they Britt not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced the side amen and forth with Kim right blood and water and he saw he that saw a record and his record is true and he knew it what he says is true that gimmick belief for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled not a bone and his body would not be broken and brother Branham I've got another quote later on and that's the way I did my business back to front I mean I should be quoting in this next quote nigh but later on where he says that the hand of God stabbed that drunk soldier a man he would just smashed into him I'm sick of us take him down to the cross get them pirinen and let us get back to drinking in them and Lenin art bollocks well I tell you what something held him back amen and somebody else to dominate Pierce aside the Brad can come for a braid could come forth they got on the camera his rib and this Brad commit of his side hallelujah that's what he says amen that the scripture should be fulfilled did you realize today amen scripture cannot be broken oh come on oh let me take you on here I don't know yeah he loved the brick of Scripture but he can't praise God when Jesus quoted the word timmy's what would they say why'd you say that you know and that's no answer to it he didn't know what to do with it so and then he said what if you come up here and I give you these kingdoms and he said it's written a manual worship the Lord thy God only have now as I serve and he didn't know what they were nobody will said he departed from him for a short space of time but the word defeated him and the word will always defeat him hallelujah here he thought well he's dead was just brick as bones couldn't do it could not do it hallelujah make me said you know when but not boy was raised from the dead and and finland's and brother Ronald was speaking about it and he said you could line up every demon in Hell to stop that happening and they couldn't stop it happening because God had said it was going to happen and thus saith the Lord and did happen well that's what you've got this afternoon you have got scripture that cannot be broken brother Branham says of course he says amen he said Amen he said I'm going to heaven sure I am the scripture cannot be broken to you who don't believe in saying him wonder or see how could you get away from the scripture and can't be broken no more than Christ can can't be done away with hallelujah can't break the scripture you know the Bible says talking about heaven he said Peter says there's a place reserved in heaven for you you better believe why oh brother just said don't make it scripture cannot be broken it has to be fulfilled and when you walk into your reserved place you'll say today is this scripture fulfilled because it couldn't be broken I'm telling you and could not be broken if you break the word you have broke God's promise and you can't do it hallelujah hold mine and my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go I will come again and receive you unto myself not where I am ye shall be also go on break the scripture break the scripture

Neeson's language was being spoken although they were speaking in English and they could hear it that was marvelous wonderful thing praise God he does I'd like further from him when he's praying for a

except the father draws her amen listen to this all Scripture is given by inspiration and our Blessed Lord said in the scripture cannot be broken it must be fulfilled what a consolation not that to give to we the people that really read these scriptures knowing not what we read cannot be broken this is not your newspaper I don't know that got here and kids well probably the kids feel like or something I don't know but I know one thing this is Scripture we're talking about hallelujah you know amen the and the Gainesville newspaper that could say one thing today and change it tomorrow and it wouldn't even apologize for doing it hallelujah but we're not talking about a newspaper we're talking about God's holy written word that it cannot be broken hallelujah can you think of all the things that you could think of it today hallelujah amen well Paul said I know who my heart believes I know he is able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day and we can say scripture cannot be broken it will be it will be fulfilled hallelujah my gives us a foundation to rest our faith on that every scripture must be fulfilled and there's no way that it will not be for fault there's no way because it cannot be broken hallelujah on the road to Emmaus amen when he talked a little while he says ought not Christ to have suffered these things it's not not what the word says is that not what the scriptures say and he could have told them he said brothers scripture cannot be broken he could have said it hallelujah because he said ought not the Christ have done these things well well that's true yeah yeah but but we thought yeah when they thought they were going to get the kingdom right there and just check the Romans open and then the old father sees would rule that wasn't God's will hallelujah his kingdom was in hearts alone that day praise God so hallelujah amen he said what Noddy have suffered these things in Enderlin his glory and beginning at the prophets a man comes through the sounds amen what I told him all the scriptures amen that they couldn't be broken that his body could not lie more than 72 hours and gnihton why because scripture cannot be broken hallelujah if someone could say now I can prove that he was 74 hours in the tomb you have broke the Word of God and you can't break it brother Branham actually said it is impossible for scripture to be broken imagine that impossible hello my my you know you could talk up with money things uh will there be a rapture oh I hope so hope you don't need a hope so like that that is hope because a future but mine say well scripture cannot be broken can't be broken if God said he will come down with a shot he's going to come down with a side we've experienced time today is the scripture for public experience time amen the votes of the organs of the voice of the Resurrection to the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah we love them too it's happening praise God we can direct on why because scripture

inspiration God's breath God breeze and it cannot it's impossible for it to be broken hallelujah the word that's allotted for every years why did it come because scripture cannot be broken what are the lines you come on the scene cuz scripture cannot be broken it had to be fulfilled and had to be fulfilled in a hard day that's it Elijah we're talking about not John the Baptist not that I just come to juice but the Elijah that would restore all things and he done it according to revelation 10 and 7 amen thank God hallelujah alright alright I was just going for if it could I take a few more moons praise God hallelujah just to get it right up to the Amen to the word of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God it's strange then that a spirit would be misunderstood by ecclesiastics of the day if it was in that day but he was doing just the same thing I was listening to what is the attraction on the mind what was he doing he was four full in Scripture why was he for full in Scripture because scripture cannot be broken it said behold your king come with lowly on the fall of an ass amen behold your king and they didn't see it but I'll tell you what some saw it and scripture was fulfilled because it can't be broken you take any strips I'm telling you you take any promise and you can read after it scripture cannot be broken anyone you killed arrayed a men look look look well maybe I'll touch that I mean look what he says they men when we read it and look today is this scripture fulfilled that was wearing there to be filled amen and what happens when brother Branham was printed and Burton's a man that the world could not take another birth pian and it cannot do it hallelujah and and he couldn't find the place and the Catholic priest whenever a bishop came out and give us the Bible and he read that scripture because it was blurred like stuck together just the other one amen and then that evening the Israel of God says today as the scripture for for what scripture the day of vengeance of our God every day you read a Burt California every day you read about it and one day you'll not read about it because we'll be gone but it will sink now you say old George how can you say because it's thus saith the Lord and thus said the Lord is the promise thus said the Lord cannot be broken and was never broken in the scripture not one time not one time how many times hey man can you read annual Testament in the New Testament the promise and it was never broken it can't be broken hallelujah oh my my goodness praise the Lord listen to this look just listen to this as we just try and close down let you go home I know some of you gotta write tonight but oh my look at this here John look through the whole book of Revelation and he comes to a little thing and he sees us like we read earlier today but about the parade and walking in the lane and he sees us and he says the bride has made herself ready oh is that the Word of God is that really the Word of God you know when you think about it the brightest men know not then but I'll tell you what we've come on do a day when the bride has made herself ready we're not we're not babies anymore than the gospel show we're not we're not drinking I know your beer pots they're not giving your milk only maybe if you need an odd little supplement they might but I'll tell you what we're on the meat of the word and it says the bride that's what he saw projected Richter all day and says the bride has made herself ready so if scripture cannot be broken a man of scripture must be fulfilled brother Branham said somebody and it's called a fulfill it well how do you hear me our prophet here we are will fulfill it we are fulfilling it glory to God hey man why the bride has made herself ready because God says she has that's what he saw it's not said the Lord and scripture cannot be broken that's why you can be certain of God because you know whatever promise he gives you they say it has to be fulfilled amen and they said there's going to be a resurrection it has to be fulfilled hallelujah Wow amen praise God if he said it restored what let me read this a would you let me revisit he died and he rose again according to the scriptures Wow scripture cannot be broken be for folded because it couldn't be broken hey man this is the Lamb of God he did it that's how you know we did it that's how you can be certain of God because the scripture was never broken burger with couldn't be broken it's impossible he had to die and he had to raise again according to what what Paul wrote no according through the scriptures now you're getting the best word according to scriptures I want you to be very careful and see this God promised at the end came all I care for is going to be fulfilled and it has to be for the spirit crankin Word of God spoken by mother the Prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it just before Christ comes the second time the ten Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled everything every promise that God has made us will be fulfilled before we see that Cardinal coming somewhere right there per LeBron said there's no more they'd be fulfilled for us it could come tonight he could come tomorrow morning and I'll say even so Lord Jesus come no water John could write that at the end why cuz John you scripture can help you hallelujah what isn't it Doris amen praise God amen he will he would be right with the word he will take the whole Bible Genesis Revelation he will start at the serpent seed carry on to the messenger in the lottery and but he will be rejected by the denominations not be the bride by the denomination's hallelujah well bye-bye denomination say me and yet reject God's prophet like a hotbed I tell you is nothing with judgment for you Amen praise God okay hallelujah he restored the Pentecostal faith to us and even brother Branham says he gives a quote he said I speak not to you all he said I know who I'm chosen and he said what the scripture must be fulfilled what what Scripture what scripture Lord are you exactly talking about you said about the one that's gonna betray me it's in the scripture he's lifted up his heel against me I'm telling you can you break a scripture he had to be there sure you had to be there and it's so nice for me to look down and y'all say that none of you are sleeping hey where is God it's okay if you dead I wouldn't mind and then but you see when the word gets a grip up yeah hey man you think oh wow yeah even Judas had to do what he was mad to do lift up his heel against them why cuz the scripture cannot
