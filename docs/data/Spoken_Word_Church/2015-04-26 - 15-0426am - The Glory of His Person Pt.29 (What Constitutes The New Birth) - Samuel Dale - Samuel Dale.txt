we love you and we thank you you have your way in the service in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 12-15 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brce as they had as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters one of these days we'll get back to that scripture but we're gaining ground anyway so now we'll go to John 3 very familiar scripture with all of us says there was a man of the Pharisees named NC emus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now remember we emphasized that he gave him a great honor he gave him a great uh position in things no man can do these things but then what did Jesus say he didn't jump out bragging on him and all kind of things what did he say to a most religious man that you could think of a great great man what did he say Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the the kingdom of God that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again let's stop right there we won't go into 10 this you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been trying to get a lot you know there the point and talks of what we're talking about and for the past few Services we've been talking about uh you know the point of saying Nicodemus when he he couldn't understand what Jesus was saying which was simple plain language and especially to us that are over on this side we can look back and say well look like Nicodemus could have understood right you know Jesus was just telling him he needed to be born again but remember nobody had ever taught up to this stage about a new birth there was no teachings of of them back there telling them that they needed to be these things uh they were taught that they were saved by following the law that's right they thought they were right in the sacrifices and the doings and and and then see because Jesus recognize he recognized Jesus as a teacher and you go on down through the reading and Jesus recognizes him as a teacher instead of teacher now like you are in Israel and don't know these things because see they were under the carnal application of their own mind and thinking trying to figure it out remember that hey there's Sister Mary good see you amen amen good for her to be with us today am and see in doing what he was doing then he was Jesus was trying to tell him what he needed to do not in the basis of some religious act or doings because as we said Nicodemus would have been glad to have got up and done any of those things that he would say but when he said you must be born again to a man that thought by being an Israelite a Jew as we would call it and being you know in the lineage and especially being as he was a uh a great teacher the teacher in Israel all right and doing that then it it looks like it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say when Jesus would say you you must be born again but remember we read there where the Prophet was explaining it the other week about it that really Jesus was saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus if You' have just stayed away from this fing tradition right that's it following the the elders and the things said you ought have known that I was going to have to come because it was promised in the word of the Messiah to come and said you order known then if you're recognizing me to be something of saying we know that God is with you because no man can do the things you are doing unless God is with him all right see then he he he he should have by making that statement he should have as quick as Jesus see we read it here and we read just a a a concept or a thought that's been put into uh the writing and see it may have been 30 minutes or an hour that they were talking not a a 15minute conversation just come in and he sits down and Jesus look at you need to be born again no he would probably had went through a lot of things maybe they ate together that evening maybe they sat around and discussed a lot of the scriptures and the things you know and then it kind of come on around into a position you know to where that they would talk of this and Jesus said you must be born again and Nicodemus you know he'd say it's like we would say now we're over here as I said looking back but he was looking at it he was saying you mean I I need to go back to my mother's W and come forth again and Jesus said no that wouldn't do you no good cuz it didn't do you any good the first time you came wrong all right now into doing that then he was saying to him there's something that you don't know that you need to do and you need to sit down and listen for a little while but a man goes away wondering what does it mean right Jesus went on to say now that he's just got to be born of water and a spirit maybe he told him now Nicodemus you know what the natural birth is you know the natur birth that you came from your mother came with a three-part thing as to the water breaking then the blood coming forth and then the baby coming forth see then he was putting it in language to him that he would probably understand some things but yet you cannot understand the kingdom of God without being born again I don't care how much knowledge you have of it I don't care how much you've read about it how much you know about it intellectually but until you're born again you cannot follow that line because it takes the spirit of God to reveal that so here is a man that is the greatest religious guy you could think of but yet he's in an unregenerated State why because there was no way back there that you could be born again cuz Jesus Christ did not come and died that's what he would be saying to Nicodemus you know the scriptures of what the Messiah must do right he must come he must die he must give his life to let that life come back upon you to where that you could have eternal life all right but see like I said we look back at it because we've had 2,000 years to talk about this and we'd say well all Nicodemus had to do was believe you know or believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved all right that scripture but how can you believe without an inside teacher right you believe intellectually you believe knowledge we're going to get to some of these things in the later messages as we precede a little but yet you can have every bit of that knowledge and still not be born again amen right but you see we we talk about said well we know we're born again and like I said we we good old Baptists we'd say we we know we're born again because it come on De Pentecost well what's that got to do with it I wasn't there on the day of Pentecost so there's no need of me talking about what happened there I need to talk about what's happening now see it's a different situation in doing that so it's not not that we just say well the poor old guy he just all he had to do is believe he credits Jesus as I've said over and over he credits him with being coming from God he come to hear him he believed in him that much and in doing that then let's get away from that carnal part of just thinking well it's all you got to do is believe yeah right well that's a good starting point right but that's all it is to believe is a good starting point then ask God to Quicken that that you believe that's right to make that alive into your soul to where that you can understand all right now we went through and we we taught a message there the other week on what why must you be born again right you know it it would probably been hard to explain to Nicodemus that he needed to be born again even today it'd be hard to explain to him well because like I said here he is he's done everything he's kept the laws he's leing it to the letter and you tell him he needs to be born again and he say well what do I need to do you know why must I be born again and he said Nicodemus you was born wrong well I can show you my lineage I can show you everything I can show you my life and everything is right but that still didn't solve the problem see brother brandom on black on birth pains he said it was hard to get those Pharisees to realize they was lost well after 2,000 years it's hard to get people to realize that they're lost to where God can do something about it that's right because see we've been pumped and trained and and everything else to try to make a public confessions and doing even living right and thing that's good but have we been born again all right see we were born in sin shapen in iniquity and espoused from our mother's wound to going forth a liar amen right that's the reason we need to be born again was born lost yes all right Ephesians 2:1 says who were dead in trespasses and sin that's who we are Ephesians 2:5 says even when we were dead in sin so then we were born no matter what you think you were alive but as far as spiritual things you were born dead right and that's why Jesus said you cannot not understand the kingdom you cannot see the kingdom see that's a word to us we say well do you understand do you see that and see that's what Jesus was trying to get to man to see all right and seeing that we were born that way then because of that first birth being wrong what good would it do to his Nicodemus said for me to go back to my mother and be born again what good would it do it wouldn't do any good why because you're born wrong to start with you born a second time you just be born wrong again yeah but I can prove my Mom and Daddy was married my that ain't what I'm talking about amen we were born as the prophet calls it in a great wording spoken words Regional seed we were born between Satan and Eve now every little baby that comes into the world is born between Satan and Eve no no born my mama my daddy well kind of get a little spiritual thinking right exactly you were brought here by an act that was turned into perversion right right that's it even though Mama and Daddy was married that still that was the way you was born physically come from a sex act right right and that's why the psalmist would says he did and bringing many scriptures together born in sin shaping in iniquity a spouse from my mother's wound a liar psalmist knew a lot about us didn't he right he was telling it from the Holy Spirit speaking but what about being born between Satan and Eve what is he saying all right the act that we're born from is a natural concept all right that's sensible and it takes lust and desires to bring those things into being all right so that should be enough sensible right to see then what takes place right it's not to say well BL we just won't we won't have no more of that we'll just quit that well I don't think that'll work I've not got any confidence in that point because the devil is not going to let you do it that way he's going to keep you in a line to where it will be working and will'll be done that way and you know they can test you but all they want to but it's still got all kind of problems involved okay now see every one of us then were being as we were born we were born to hybrid right which was not God's original plan amen right right it was not God's original plan for you and I to be born the way we were born am so that's why we will be born a hybrid all right and death can't breed death you can't bring it back from it all right so then Nicodemus would be right in what he was saying he says if I go back to my mother's wound and come forth again that wouldn't help me any if you say I was wrong to start with right and see what I said this it's not written in there and a whole lot but surely there's not a five you could read that in less than five minutes and he's out the door yeah no no a great discussion takes place all right so we get the thought of what it is and understand all right but we know too that Jesus in what he was saying there in John 3 he says You must be borned again now we read the original and brought it to you where it says You must be born from above not just go through another natural birth you got to be born from above Jesus was simply saying you got to be born again from where I come from amen from above all right Prophet says on why uh was I'm not against why and I'm against organized religion he says you got to be birthed from above that's right all right Jesus said in John 18:36 said my kingdom is not of this world if it was my disciples would fight so he wasn't speaking of of a natural Kingdom even like I told you you still get over in Acts one right along in there even after his resurrection after all the things that had happened after all they had seen him the disciples said will will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time right they still had their mind set on some form of Earthly thing why because he wasn't born again they had to promise they were believing onto yes but they had not received the new birth they had a great confession they had seen the sick healed the dead raised all kind of things taking place in their Ministry even Judas the Bible said had part of the ministry the one that finally turned Jesus in but he had part of the ministry because that was the time that was what the Lord Jesus had given him all right now then in that I ask you to read Matthew Mark Luke and John and see how many times it speaks of the kingdom and what it speaks of that Kingdom right the kingdom is liking to this the kingdom is liking to this kingdom is lik to this all different kind of parable speaking of the Kingdom but after all was said and done I said after all they had seen they still thought he was going to turn over the kingdom to the Israelites at that time they could see easily oh yes he's going to drive off all these Romans he's just going to kill all these people he going to drive out all this and we Jews are going to take over but see that's the carnal mind trying to understand the spiritual part of God and that won't work all right now see all Christians are born from above amen right there's where the secret there's where the mystery is that's what people don't understand today to have the new birth you must have the life of Jesus Christ is that true amen all right see then that life of Jesus Christ came from above didn't come from here right amen his mama didn't have anything to do with his body other than an incubator to carry it she didn't Supply no egg and God give uh birth to the egg cuz you'd had an intercourse intercourse act to take place to bring it down and we don't believe in stuff like that that's right God created the egg and the sperm or germ whatever you want to call placed it into the wound of Mary and she was simply an incubator you see that now because you go up to Gainesville up there and they'll show you in a hurry that they got millions of chickens today in incubators being born that the mom and daddy ain't nowhere around but still it takes a birth all right see we have to be citizens from above Jesus said I'm not of this world right and he said ye are not of this world right right well he was trying to get them to understand stand where that we would be citizens from by the new birth we become citizens of Heaven because that's where Jesus came from right so it would require that we must accept Jesus Christ as our savior to in any form have anything to do with the kingdom of God all right simple thought but yet trying to get you to think a little bit of about the situation brother Dale you a lot of times preach like that none of us ain't got nothing well if we realize we ain't got nothing we can do something about it right so I've done my job I may be a good devil I'll try my best to be one can I quote the prophet he said if I'm going to be this or that let me be a good one that's right so if I'm going to be a good devil let me be a good devil if I can any way provoke you to the point for you to think that you need to be born again then I've done my job don't be so super religious to reject the word of God though all right now look what then does it take when you're dealing with the subject of the new birth Born Again experience whatever you want to call it what does it take to make that birth right what does it take to make that birth okay let's read a little bit and just let brother brandom explain because we firmly believe in that God sent a prophet we don't believe he's any more than that and doesn't that solves that problem but we just read uh if I had a lot of Luther's reading I have some of it I quote some things from him I'll do all of that I would do it with Wesley or anybody else John Smith uh you know but listen to what the prophet has to say and then get your scriptures in the right order off of demonology E18 says for instance like this when Jesus died at Calvary how many what elements came from his body all right giving you simple terminology right what elements came from the body of Jesus water blood spirit or as we call it life whatever is that right now any Minister any believer knows that that's what constitutes the new birth is that right that constitutes the new birth St John 75 for there are three that by record water blood Spirit now if you get into that really there's a three there's are three that that by record in heaven there in John and that is the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one the Bible says all right and then it says there's three that be witness in the earth which is water blood and spirit and they agree with one in one all right what does it take to make the natural birth water breaks blood comes yeah and then the baby come what does it take to make a spiritual birth all right water blood spirit out of the body of the Lord Jesus came what when they pierced his side out came water right all right then it was mingled and mixed with blood and doings you know and so that would be water blood and then the life was released from the body and went up and came back on the day of Pentecost to bring that new birth all right so what does it take to make those the word constitute is a is a word that means uh means to compose you know put together things or what anything consist of or like uh you take mortar mortar you know like you lay blocks mortar is composed of lime and sand what it mean means to whatever something consist of or is composed of all right so the natural birth is composed of water blood life the new birth consist of what from the Lord Jesus came the water the blood and the life all right now to bring that down we don't believe in bringing down the physical blood you know we don't believe in the having the physical water that comes out of the of the body of Christ so what is that translated into to you and I right justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right water blood and spirit justification see sanctification justification by Believing on God and receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to show that you're taking on that name all right and that's why we don't believe in father son Holy Ghost because that the real true is Lord Jesus Christ all right but see then you have to go through sanctification which is a cleansing and setting aside and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost well how many churches teach that now no you go to this one it believes in this you go to that one it believes in that you go to here it believes in that go to another one you shout you speak in tongues you do things you know you cry and you say oh they're saved well that's between you and God whether you're saved or not amen I didn't lose you and I can't save you all right I didn't make you lost and I can't make you save that's between you and God all right you got to work out your own salvation all right but see explaining things in simple terminologies the prophet would explain it that say justification that you're receiving Jesus Christ as your savior you come to the altar you repent you say I'm sorry you know Lord forgive me you accept him as your savior all right then the next thing is to follow him in water baptism to show that your repentance and things was genuine and you follow him into his name all right and then you come to the Second Step which is sanctification which is a cleansing and setting aside and Jesus said the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man walketh in dry places seeketh rest findeth none comes back and finds a house swept and garnished he enters back into the house it's seven times worse the second time than it was the first that's paraphrasing but that's scripture right cleansing setting you aside all right because you can't put God in an unclean vessel is that what he says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel but now so don't try to put the devil and God and there together as one now that won't work out too good right amen you got a whole lot to do and we're going to get down to those things as we get on through the message but think about it simple illustration you look out in the yard and you find a GCE a cup or Etc or something in the yard and you say hey I got a use for that well you don't take that in the house and pour water in it and drink out of it do you right so number one you picked it up you had a reason for it right number two you take it in the house and you wash it real good see that's sanctification Sanctified by the washing of the word is what the Bible calls all right well see then you got to put it in service you got a reason for picking it up now your reason can be fulfilled by placing within that glass the water the drink or whatever you're deciding to take so now you've come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a simp illustration simple illustration of what takes place in the New Birth you realize that you're lost that's number one CU it don't matter if you saved you ain't going to you think you saved you ain't going to try no better no way nowhere to repent right cuz see that's where the people today be just like Nicodemus I explained the simple terminology simple point point of water blood and spirit that Jesus said we got to be born that way all right now try to explain that to people today that's been in church all their life and they're good people that's right but ask them did they when did they get born again or do it as Paul said one day Paul said have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe but we good old Baptist had it figured out that you got it when you believe that's not scripture that's right am uhuh no it's after you believe see now getting into details that brings things into being that you're looking at things and wondering well you know I I've been at church all of my life I've always went to church well that's good I've been a Dale ever since I was born never one day without anything else but did that make me worth anything no but you see then you got to come to that place to where that you can understand what the new birth then consist of it consist of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and accepting him as your savior repenting of your sins and then asking God to cleanse you and take away the desires of those things that you used to do right asking him to set you aside with that point to cleanse you and get you clean enough that the Holy Ghost can come and live in you and see that's why the prophet says it this way there's not too many new birse all right why because people won't go with it that way right you come along where you get into our ranks and what we call the message people are you going to explain to the most of the people of this message that they're not born again well that's none of your business brother Dale no no it's not that's why I preach here I'm not out there that's none of my business I'm preaching here want anybody listen to this that's their business I'm not the pastor except to those who call me their Pastor all right no but you see how is it to try to explain something what do you mean brother Dale we just believe we believe the message what is that statement about the Church of Christ says we believe what the Bible says and we only say what the Bible says well you know that's not true because present to them one true and living God and see what they say present to them water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and see what to say the Bible's still talking and they doesn't quit right that's not throwing off on them it's just illustrating to see what we're doing well we believe the prophet's message well so does the devil does that make him saved come on well what else you want us to do all I want you to do is get born again well I've been born again 40 years praise the Lord now now our life will prove whether we're born again or not so if our life doesn't tally up to what word we claim then right we're the ones that are saying we're not born again right well it don't bother me to do this that well then maybe you're not born again yet right right we see simple faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to believe that he paid my debt and if he paid my debt why would I not be uh concerned why would I not be uh willing to follow in the line that he would want me to follow if he paid my debt that I can't pay right and he made way by releasing that water that blood and that life that I could come to a place of a new birth but you see we put it on as I was trying to cover the other day you know you asked people are you born again I shouted I cried I spoke in tongues all right there's 969 different denominations 2,000 in the message all right and every one of them has got a way of saying what the new birth is now is the Bible that confused I thought it had one way of saying things well you think you the only one knows what it said no but if I do know what it says then I don't have to worry about it it's not you're not going to argue with me about time you're going to be arguing with the word of God could it be we're in the same situation of Nicodemus a great religious Society but yet we are not born again that's right that's hard to think about but you see we want to put it all always upon something we've done or don't do right I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit chewing I quit running around I quit all these things I quit I quit this I quit that and that's good wonderful but did you do it because of the new birth inside of you or did you do it because of your own willpower I didn't like smoking so I didn't have no problem never tried drinking didn't have no problem does that make me saved would you remember what we were trying to bring bring out that those things are what we call attributes the baby crying is not the birth of the baby that means the baby did get here right right the baby gets here it's spanked or whatever the shock of coming in the world it starts crying the crying is not the baby that's what the baby's doing see then the new birth is not what we do or don't do it's what he's already done and for us to have our faith based into that that's right that's why the Bible says Bible doesn't say he that believes and is baptized it doesn't say that it ain't Bible it said he that believeth amen which is a continuation Keep On Believing he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved amen all right but you see we put it on some kind of something that you know that we can do act like a Christian do like a Christian but that don't mean we're saved that's right amen Nicodemus had a pretty good place to be standing right you couldn't bring nothing against him you realize the high priest which Nicodemus wasn't but you realize the high priest and probably was for them too but the high priest if he had one Mark against him he'd be taken out and be killed not a whole lot just one little Mark all right but you say but brother Dale you're taking away everything that I've ever thought about of knowing why that I'm saved well praise the Lord you want to preach about four more hours we'll go through lunch right on in this afternoon keep on going to try to see the point of whether we're born again or not right oh no that's not the way people do it they want tell you oh you believe the message don't you you believe the prophet and you believe the way we believe it especially especially to believe it the way we believe it you know we believe we believe it like it's supposed to be believed you know well so does everybody else say that all right but think about it now here's what we want to get into for a little bit this is the thought of the whole message so if you don't get nothing else get this thought where does the New Birth take place in the soul all right it doesn't take place in the body right cuz the Bible says the body without the spirit is dead all right do you understand that's James 2 and 26 the body without the spirit is dead right all right yeah but but but brother Dale that no that displays that displays something else inside of you you that motivates you right you take and you tap somebody on the head you mess up the spinal cord the nerve endings and what is it a vegetable can still think can still talk can do everything just like it was before but can't move a muscle so there something went wrong wrong somewhere right all right so the body without the spirit is dead right now then so we don't need to talk about the body of the new birth the body displays what's inside of us so we got to go deeper than just what you're looking at amen all right we go in into the second realm of mankind known as the spirit because the outer realm of mankind is what if the brothers can where's brother Joe okay you may have to run back there and run that up if you want to I meant to tell you I forgot it to draw into the circles and the things all right but see the second realm of man is known as the spirit of man which is your memory your reason your conscience to affection the body it has five senses called see taste feel smell hear all right all that does is contact this world out here right or display something that's motivating it the next part of you is where the trouble is at right because DS were the memory the reason the conscience affections love Etc is in that second real called a spirit real right but then inside of you is a being that is called a soul and that Soul either has one f one sense it's either Faith or doubt you're either born again or you're not born again you either have God living in you or the devil is motivating you either way you want to go it's got to be one of the two there is no gray areas amen right all right so we're not born again in our body that would help I'm 75 it would really help to be 21 again but the world couldn't stand me because I if I holler and scream now and try to preach what would I be doing when I and I used to do that coming into this message I really done a lot of hollering and screaming but what good does that do the body without the spirit is dead right all right now there's a second real as we said of you it's called a spirit realm all right and that Spirit real is memory reasons go here he has it up here see you got the outer Court inner courts which is the Old Testament going but look what it's talking about see you got the the doings that comes around you got see taste feel smell and have to move it up just a ha to get it uh that's okay they everybody ought to know that anyway that you know C taste feel smelling here all right that gives you an understanding to look at but inside of that is something that's more real than your fleshly body it is a spiritual realm that is what motivates you that's What Makes Your Body Move that's what makes you do the things you do is the spirit that is within you there's where the lust the the problems and the things come to pass is in the spirit realm the second real the part of where it's memory reason conscious affections and things that's what causes our trouble all right because that is the part that we call the spirit now all right I make sure that I say this because people are are on the internet are listening they think well you didn't say that right I'll explain it again in the early Ministry of brother brandham he would explain Body Spirit and soul and he would explain that as to be the three Realms of man then in the later Ministry he be to explaining it as body let's see he explained early Ministry Body Soul spirit all right putting the spirit in the center in the last part of the ministry he was explaining as body spirit and soul but now the point is he didn't have to correct that because he was right in what he was saying it was just words he was using because the first real of man he always gave C face field smelling here the second realm of man no matter if he called it Spirit or Soul he always gave it to Five Senses all right which is a memory reason conscience imagination and things as you're reading and going around but then he always gave the center of man to be amen Faith or doubt that's right amen all right now where our trouble is at is in that second Rim amen whatever you want to call it just remember to get your senses correct and then you'll be all right watch what you're reading in the senses when it says soul in the early Ministry and read it and it'll save uh you know memory reason conscience affs you know what he's talking about the second real where in the last days when he would use the word so you know what he talking about the sinner RM because he said it's either Faith or doubt all right that's a simple point to understand you say well well why did that be done like that well maybe God let it be done that a way to confuse a lot of people why did he say the himself to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost Matthew 28:19 then when Peter come over that had the Keys of the Kingdom Matthew 16 and Peter comes over to the basis and Peter says You must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ right now why would he allow that to be done to where people can be confused amen about what they're doing yes and not following the story completely they will be mly confused so when we get a little bit later on as speaking about it where he Saidi give you a New Soul and watch his memory reason conscious affections and it'll come out you'll understand see by the new birth I mean you should accept the natural illustration I just gave you know there's no argument you tell me there is where is an argument when you say that a prophet says Body Soul Spirit then later he says Body Spirit spirit and soul but he always said 5 cents is body 5 cents is second 1 cents for The Sinner now there's no human argument course I don't do no good I don't take away people's thinking CU they're going to think that especially you two Soul people see they couldn't stand that because they had to get that Soul involved all right it's in the doctrinal issue so is it so why you got Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal ET and then you got bramit H it's because of a misconception of the truth amen right is it father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ I've even heard people of this message say we take Matthew 28 uh they take Matthew 28:19 we take acts 238 I said you're wrong if you take acts 238 you're going to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ see but see those points you know you say well why do you say that every once in a while they keep you from being confused hey I may be 75 I may not have much sense but that devil still talks and if you get to be 95 you'll still be talking to you and me that's right and he'll be telling us how wrong this is is and how wrong that is and quoting you scriptures right so you put it down you say well okay that's it it's soft well you're just stubborn is it right give me a sensible answer as I said to the minister Brethren 30 something years ago give me a sensible answer can you say that the Prophet is right here and wrong here I don't I'm not go through that right I may be dumb but I ain't stupid I ain't going that far I'm going to say what he's saying until I can understand what he's saying it'll come together now to get to point then the new birth does not come in your body it only displays what's inside of you the new birth is not in your spirit I don't want the new birth just in my spirit you know what I wind up being an anointed one I think we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost all over the whole body Spirit soul and every part of our being right we need it yep but remember the body without the spirit is dead so that's no good and the misconcept the misconception of the second real of mankind that's where our problem is at right CU Jesus said it he said the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man walketh in dry places as sanctification cuz that's where your unclean Spirit goes out we'll get to it later on this evening I guess now but that unclean Spirit goes out if the Holy Spirit don't come in it won't be long till the devil's coming back that's right all right and you know what the big problem then is he's going to come back with emotions signs and wonders amen right but remember Judas had signs and wonders following him the Bible said is come on that he had part of the ministry come on we're still in the Bible right he wasn't just a fly by night he was the Secretary of the crowd the The Man of the Year to everybody but the Lord Jesus they knew who he was he was the money guy remember right the treasure right but now think about it so thank God for a prophet that would explain things amen yes sir you you ought to thank him every you ought to thank God every day for God sending us the truth amen about 10,000 times each day but it said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free it didn't say you'll know about the truth head knowledges or anything there's one thing in there that really got me the other day and I don't I'll just go ahead and tell you you know it's memory reason conscious affection and now all that works through the brain okay TR but you know it's never called knowledge you say yeah I got this quote where said no you're not thinking what I'm talking about this one's called knowledge it's not called memory reason conscience affection right that's knowledge that's Holy Ghost knowledge it's not just memory reason conscience and affection okay all right but think now that second Rim whatever you out there hear this and you get all confused about it whether you want to call it Soul or want to call it Spirit just remember it has five senses okay now we got that problem solved didn't help none but we got it where you can't argue that point now what about it that you can be anointed on that Spirit real with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit and still be lost and just as devil possessed as you was to start with now there's the place we ought to deal a whole lot on right cuz that would be the one that would be the most confusing yes is the second realm of man right right cuz in that second realm of man is where you have all of these thoughts and ideas from amen even as a newborn believer there's a whole lot more wrong thoughts than there are good thoughts if that ain't true with you then pray for me and we'll quote to prophit a few things about him where the devil tempted him when we'll quote about the Lord Jesus was able to be tempted you know but think about it see if you're born again in your spirit you'd have trouble right now if you believe that you're born again in the spirit realm you're in vast trouble because you can be anointed in there and you can't tell it different and it is a genuine Holy Spirit see the new birth is not an anointing we will get to these things the new birth is a person it is not an anointing it is not a feeling it is not a crying or a shouting or speaking in tongues or seeing visions or whatever amen the new birth is a birth of a person right right but that doesn't take place in your body and it does not take place in your spirit realm right it is in the soul where the new birth transpires now I'm going to say something that's going to be for this afternoon but I want you to think then justification sanctification is not in your body and spirit I leave you for a second to consider the body and spirit only displays the justification the sanctification does do any good to be Sanctified in your spirit I mean it does good yeah yeah well see I say things I try to get you to think and and I leave an open hole it really does wonderful to be Sanctified Body Spirit soul mind whatever I got needs it but remember if the new birth is not in the body and the new birth not in the spirit then you better put the new birth where it's supposed to be the new birth is not your body body that decides this come on it's not Ezekiel I give you a new heart and I give you a new spirit then I put my spirit in you remember that's wrongly taught he don't take your heart out but he takes the heart out of you that's motivating you okay so think about it see if the new birth is not in your body and the new birth is not in your spirit then the new birth would be in your soul and then it would work back out through your spirit through into your body that's right correct see then you're not born again your body or your spirit you're born again in the soul come on well brother D I've been run a message a long time ain't never heard it like that well where have you been and where's the people that you heard been I thought the whole message was the new birth that's right I thought when you're prophet got over to the seventh seal he said now go on with the same simple message says because if not said it'll go from you what is the same simple message you must be born again you ever notice brother randam will say it like this he said when I go out there among those churches I Don't Preach Doctrine you ever noticed that how many quotes you need of that I Don't Preach Doctrine but how many times have you ever heard him explain the new birth in a denominational Church how many times have you ever heard him explain one God in a denominational Church how many times have you ever heard him explain you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right in the middle of a denominational church but he said he didn't preach Doctrine now have you ever thought about that now those are doctrines right but I I want you to think with me for a second it'll help you to understand why he'd say those things those are things that are written in the Bible that should have been taught in every Church sir right so he wasn't beating on them he was just reading the Bible and explaining it that they should have already been reading yes and he said I Don't Preach Doctrine but said you know what I believe that happened in the garden see you can preach the Bible as a Doctrine or you can preach the Bible as a truth way that is not a Doctrine amen that's right it's the thought or concept of the entire word of God am right let's get these out way and we'll pick up a little B more this evening see you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul right so in the soul takes place justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul amen right not just in your body not just in your spirit but then whatever goes inside Works back out am right so what do you think the body without the spirit is dead now what about being Anointed with the Holy Spirit in your spirit why wouldn't that save you if that's all your new birth is why wouldn't it save you well I never thought about that say it again where have you been why is it not taught in the message of course it's all these great Revelations he great things what good is any Revelation without the Holy Spirit to reveal it so what what did your Prophet say was the most important thing of all you remember that quote what do he say the most important thing in the world to you is whether you're born again or not he said don't make no difference who's going to be president that's what everybody wants now wonder if Hillary's going to get it this time I hope she does I I ain't registered in 20 years if they'll get her up par to Pro you do it I'll go vote for her because I believe what the Bible says I put in Kings and I take out Kings Putin didn't get where he was at by being a multi billionaire these people we talk about in America with billionaires billionaire Putin's got more money than all of these billionaires put together that's according to your own newspapers but look church I know we read these a lot but do you really consider it that you can be Anointed with a genu one baptism of the Holy Spirit on your spirit and still be lost right act like a Christian do like a Christian well let me read it okay go ahead let's we got number number three let's read it number three this is called leadership 1965 1207 paragraph 259 when they get to it and the seed that I talked about a while ago roll it on up uh 259 I talked about a while ago that Soul wasn't there to start with so he's explaining something coming down it was anointed with the spirit and he done all kinds oh you when your spirit's anointed you can it's the real genuine Holy Ghost and you could still be a devil Now where's that at on your spirit right CU we'll keep going and prove it right we've read these works is Faith expressed number four the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain thing and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it Kus prophesied Judas cast out Devils the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but is what it is at the core there's where you can intellectuals can accept and say oh sure that looks good I believe that still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and this and there still isn't so because if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean they're saved that's exactly right see the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life it come see it come from God it goes to God it's the soul okay next five Christ revealed in his own word roll it on up you can be anointed out here in this spirit and desire and do all these other things now if there's a holy spirit out here anointed your desires what kind of desires you going to have right you mean the Holy Spirit anoints you and you're going to have lustful desires now don't be stupid sorry and desire do all these other things but when it comes to this toost to that word you'll never move from there it'll hold right steady and true to that word as it can be outside of that regardless what you do you're still lost and knoweth it not the people can live in this spirit and they dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that Spirit y because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she was wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her Bob and her hir was wrong wrong well what's your heart got to do with it it did the Samson whosoever shall add one word to it or what all right go on let's just stop if I got to if I go any further I have to go on into some other thoughts I hope you understand what I'm saying you're not born in your body you know born again you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul cuz the body without the spirit is dead and the spirit can be Anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit and you're still lost do you believe him we claim him to be a prophet claim that to be the word come on Brothers claim that to be right but is it true so you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit then why do you want to deal with I shouted I cried I spoke and tongue that's that's attributes of what the Holy Ghost can do but those anointed ones say the same thing the anointed ones say I'm anointed and they are amen but we'll get to it where brother Brown gets this quote he said how about being anointed to the word right amen he said not anointed to them denominations what does the word say see the word says You must be born again we say I cried I shouted I spoke in tongues I believe the message I don't have nothing to do with it unless it's coming from the inside right see the new birth is not in your body it's not in your spirit it's in your soul and you may never thought I'm sure you thought of it that way but you think about you're not justified in your body you're not justified in your spirit you can act Christians you can do all you want to you got to be justified in that soul that being that you are you got to be Sanctified into that being that you are and then outwardly the the spirit will act and do and the body will follow therein what about it let's stand what about it what do you think about it what constitutes the new birth what we got Brother 16 number 16 prob what constitutes the new birth water life justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah but but you just read with how the baptism yeah he stipulated where with that you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the baptism of the holy spirit in that soul and go to because it would be God's Own Liv the prophet said it like this he said justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the holy spirit said but the baptism is the Holy Spirit let me but but but brother Dale you just make me feel like I'm lost now what you going to do about it what are you going to do about it come on how many times have I made this statement I'd rather go all of my life crying out to God for him to reveal himself to me and show me that I'm saved then to go through my life saying I'm saved when I'm not and won't seek after him what's wrong why wouldn't we want to know that we're lost where God can do something let's believe it all right okay baby Lord Jesus our little buddy he's got sinus problems it bothered him for years and years and years we condemn it under the blood of Jesus Christ thanking you Lord for your word now come and manifest yourself as the Healer we place the blood of Jesus Christ between our little buddy and this problem with sin San you have to leave on because our Master one that says it not us we love you Lord in Jesus and brother wants a prayer cl to take to Sister Margaret let believe that this is a

night leave it there the word it is finished we believe you father in Jesus name anybody else what about it where I heard dear heavenly father we thank you for this day and I pray that what we said would be worthy Lord as to been said to your people people to try to remind us of the simple things that we must be we must be born again and to do that we must die out to ourselves and our thinking and our ideas and our thoughts and just come and lay oursel on the Altar and say Lord there it is it's all finished now come and save me have your way with each one go with us as we go eat a natural meal and bless and guide each one in Jesus name amen you dismiss the love of God is greater far than tongue or pin and ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the
