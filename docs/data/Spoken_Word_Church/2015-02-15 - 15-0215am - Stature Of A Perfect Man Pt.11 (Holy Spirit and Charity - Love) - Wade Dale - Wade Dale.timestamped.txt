[0:00] uh this morning I got up

[0:07] lowest it's been in the morning a long
[0:09] time needless to say I wish that blood

[0:14] in that bottle so this morning and I
[0:17] made this statement too is around here

[3:55] last night they did a wonderful job at
[3:59] the sweethearts banquet
[4:03] they came and helped that was one of the
[4:05] best ones we had a good time putting it
[4:07] up we had a good time taking it down and
[4:09] had a good time in between
[4:11] but a good time in the Lord I think
[4:14] I think Sister Christine found out that
[4:16] we were
[4:18] pretty crazy
[4:21] in the west I was surprised to see them
[4:23] back today
[4:29] you get into you get into asking
[4:31] questions in like a Newlywed Game you
[4:34] know you remember those from the old TV
[4:35] program The Newlywed Game we we always
[4:37] have fun with that and you kind of get
[4:40] uh you kind of get to know each other
[4:41] you kind of figure out too that the
[4:43] wives don't know much about the husbands
[4:45] and the husbands don't know much about
[4:46] the wives
[4:48] but some were in there
[4:50] the ones that won last night was brother
[4:52] Joe and sister Gwen they just beat
[4:55] everybody so bless their heart Terence
[4:58] and Lisa were second and uh
[5:01] sometimes the one you think that you
[5:03] know maybe not is going to do it will do
[5:05] it
[5:06] brother Tony and sister Esther won last
[5:08] year so uh we just you know what we're
[5:11] still human
[5:12] we still live in human life we still God
[5:15] gave us a mate
[5:20] and you're supposed to honor her
[5:22] right and you know what honor in a
[5:24] Christian way I looked at brother Louise
[5:25] last night and I said we're having all
[5:27] this fun and no alcohol involved
[5:31] we're having all this fun kids the
[5:34] greatest fun you'll ever have is with
[5:35] Christian people right
[5:37] you might think you'll have fun with
[5:39] them people out there in the world but
[5:40] no no no no no no it'll be for a
[5:43] fleeting moment only
[5:45] but this will endure forever this will
[5:48] take right over into eternity and have a
[5:51] good time with that so I want to thank
[5:53] also my mother for putting this together
[5:56] and I want to thank brother Dale too for
[5:58] paying for it
[6:01] because we have been to several that you
[6:03] have to pay a fee to go to which is fine
[6:06] I mean that's okay but but this church
[6:08] covers all expenses and everything's
[6:10] paid and actually we give out gifts and
[6:13] uh and prizes and things to uh to kind
[6:16] of help you along so so just Pat brother
[6:18] Dale on the back in sisterdale because
[6:19] they're the ones that's giving the time
[6:21] and the money for us to have a little
[6:23] bit of fun
[6:24] while we're still here on this Earth so
[6:27] and I believe like I said it'll carry on
[6:29] into eternity so let's turn to our
[6:31] Bibles to Second Peter
[6:33] chapter one and we're gonna we're gonna
[6:35] continue today we're going to try to get
[6:38] uh to the Holy Spirit today or get it
[6:41] finished and then start this afternoon
[6:43] on charity or love and go right into
[6:48] adoption
[6:49] which is a favorite subject of mine I
[6:51] I've been speaking several places I was
[6:54] at brother Joe Greene's last week and we
[6:56] spoke on the call to adoption so it was
[6:58] just kind of a uh a light version of
[7:01] what you know we would get here but but
[7:04] that is our call
[7:05] our call is to adoption it's not just to
[7:08] be good Christians there were good
[7:10] Christians all down through time but
[7:12] it's time for us to come up higher and
[7:15] the prophet of God said we can
[7:18] if you want to come up higher in God
[7:21] where that God doesn't have to treat you
[7:23] like a baby all the time
[7:25] where you can be a full-grown adult and
[7:28] God and God can use you any way he wants
[7:31] to and there's one thing for sure he
[7:33] will never use you wrong right all right
[7:35] so we depend on that and that's where we
[7:37] put our faith and our belief known that
[7:39] God will not do anything to harm you
[7:42] if anybody harms you you know who that
[7:44] is that's the Devil Himself so II Peter
[7:47] chapter one
[7:49] verse one and let's bow our head good to
[7:51] see our our friends with us they've been
[7:53] here before so good to see you again

[7:57] with you and the little brother back

[8:07] and look oh hey sister well Lord bless
[8:09] you good to have you with us

[8:18] see you good to have you here let's bow
[8:20] our hands before we get started Heavenly
[8:22] Father we pray Lord today that you come
[8:24] Among Us in a special way father
[8:26] not as we say being a bystander to
[8:29] record our thoughts and ideas but be an
[8:31] active participant in this service
[8:33] you do the speaking you do the hearing
[8:35] you do the revealing father because
[8:36] there's no way that a human will be able
[8:38] to do those things
[8:39] father we pray that you just be with the
[8:41] ones that are not here Lord we have a
[8:43] full house today but there are a few out
[8:44] that are sick
[8:46] we actually just bless them now Lord
[8:48] just in the name of Jesus Christ go and
[8:50] heal them now father
[8:52] one's Lord that are sin sick that we we
[8:55] stand every day I don't know the people
[8:57] on the internet know it or the people
[8:58] here sometimes realize that right under
[9:01] my feet is a group of names on a board
[9:05] and its family members Lord
[9:07] the ones that we've posted to keep us
[9:09] you said to continually to remember
[9:11] these things and we put their name up
[9:14] and they're right here under this sacred
[9:15] Pulpit Lord and Lord we pray that as we
[9:18] speak father that the Holy Spirit would
[9:20] go to that group of people and save
[9:21] their soul father
[9:23] bless them and take them Lord and and
[9:25] just stir their water so much to where
[9:27] they won't care about this life out
[9:29] there Lord but they'll want to have a
[9:31] life in Jesus Christ
[9:33] father just bless us Lord take care of
[9:34] us during this journey that we have we
[9:37] were the ones Lord that are on the
[9:39] foreign Mission fields that you'll bless
[9:41] them and give them fruit for their labor
[9:42] father just be with us Lord take care of
[9:45] us today forgive us of our sins in Jesus
[9:47] name
[9:48] amen
[9:49] also remembers brother Dale said
[9:51] Remember the the Dale and Sims family in
[9:54] the passing of the
[9:56] of dad's sister she was
[9:58] real sweet lady
[10:01] but uh we know how God gives rewards so
[10:05] we are like I said before we
[10:08] you look into life and the life lives
[10:12] she lived a good as much as she knew a
[10:13] nominal Christian life since Merle lived
[10:16] a good life so but now we are going to
[10:18] come into here and we're going to try to
[10:21] raise that bar up a little bit because
[10:23] God said we could all right Simon Peter
[10:26] servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to
[10:28] them that have obtained so they have to
[10:30] go get it like Precious Faith with us
[10:32] through the righteousness of God In Our
[10:34] Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[10:37] multiplied unto you through the
[10:38] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[10:40] according as his divine power so there's
[10:43] no demon power there it's divine Powers
[10:45] the power of God Amen hath given unto us
[10:48] all things that pertain unto life and
[10:50] godliness so we've been on this series
[10:52] now for seven or eight or nine services
[10:54] on how to live your life and live it
[10:57] Godly all right through the knowledge of
[10:59] him that has called us to glory and
[11:01] virtue we're by our given so these are
[11:03] gifts and they're given to us whereby
[11:05] are given unto us you know what though
[11:06] remember a pardon is not a pardon unless
[11:09] what it's accepted as a pardon the
[11:11] pardon's there but the man had to accept
[11:13] the pardon so you must accept these
[11:15] gifts God's not going to give you these
[11:17] gifts just because you're a good person
[11:19] he's not going to give you these gifts
[11:21] because you just in the message
[11:24] right
[11:26] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[11:28] great and precious promises that by
[11:30] these prophet of God said these promises
[11:32] ye might be partakers of the divine
[11:35] nature now that's not your nature that's
[11:37] the divine nature of God having escaped
[11:40] the corruption that is in the world
[11:41] through lust and besides this so okay
[11:45] besides this do what
[11:47] giving all diligence right
[11:50] add to your faith virtue into verse of
[11:52] knowledge and all these temperaments
[11:53] Temperance patience patience godliness
[11:55] godliness brotherly kindness the
[11:57] brotherly kindness charity for if
[12:00] there's that big word if if these things
[12:02] be in you not on you
[12:04] these are not anointings right
[12:08] these are actual working gifts all right
[12:11] we'll talk about that a little bit when
[12:12] we get up to the holy spirit for if
[12:15] these things be in you and abound they
[12:17] got to be overflowing they make you
[12:20] it's going to turn you from that Old
[12:21] nature make you that you shall neither
[12:23] be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[12:25] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[12:27] wouldn't want that
[12:28] neither Barry nor in fruitful but he
[12:30] that liketh these things is blind and
[12:33] cannot see afar off what rather cannot
[12:35] see Revelation and hath forgotten that
[12:38] he was purged from his old sins
[12:40] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[12:41] diligence look at all these adjectives
[12:43] give diligence to make your pastors
[12:46] calling that's not what it says to make
[12:48] your calling
[12:50] an election sure for if ye do these
[12:54] things ye shall never fall right you may
[12:57] be seated in the Lord has blessing to
[12:59] the reading of the word I love that
[13:01] reading it never gets old to read that
[13:04] even though we've read it seven or eight
[13:06] times and about two years down in the
[13:08] Sunday school class but uh we want to
[13:11] today to kind of uh since we didn't do
[13:13] anything like you you know last Sunday
[13:15] uh brother Dale brought two wonderful
[13:17] messages there that um
[13:19] that would uh help you if you'd listen
[13:22] all right Ephesians 4 let's continue
[13:25] reading on because remembering this is
[13:27] just kind of background for the ones
[13:28] that have not been here what happens in
[13:30] second Peter Peter picks up the
[13:33] revelation of God right he picks up the
[13:35] revelation of God and he says okay we
[13:37] need these things
[13:39] Faith version always implications
[13:41] but he doesn't really tell you how to
[13:43] get them he just gets you on the road
[13:45] that you got to know you have to have a
[13:47] knowledge that you need them
[13:49] then Peter picks up the rebel yeah Paul
[13:52] picks up the Revelation and it tells you
[13:54] how to get them right all right so now
[13:56] here we go Ephesians 4 11 and he gave
[13:58] some Apostles some prophets some
[14:00] evangelists and some pastors and
[14:02] teachers so that's the only way you're
[14:03] going to get it
[14:04] for the perfecting of the Saints
[14:08] all the way up for the work of the
[14:10] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[14:11] Christ what tell so there's a journey
[14:14] till till we all come into Unity of the
[14:18] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[14:19] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[14:23] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[14:25] which is all the way up there at The
[14:27] Headstone amen so Peter tells you what
[14:29] you need Paul tells you how to get it
[14:32] all right so see God has God has
[14:34] equipped this brother Louise he told us
[14:36] what we need and how to get it so what
[14:38] else do we need we need to get under
[14:40] this five-fold ministry that's a true
[14:42] faithful Ministry all right amen because
[14:45] there's some foals out there that's not
[14:47] that's not true
[14:49] but a true Firefall ministry will point
[14:51] you straight to Christ amen all right so
[14:54] now we go to the first quote that we've
[14:56] read every day every time and we're
[14:58] going to read it again brother Brown
[14:59] says notice you must be born again
[15:02] not up here
[15:04] we're going to talk about that today
[15:05] what this holy spirit is but you got to
[15:07] be born again right here at what faith
[15:10] right right notice you must be born
[15:12] again you can't have these Godly virtues
[15:14] unless God's in you to activate them
[15:16] amen amen all right and when you're born
[15:19] again you can't be born again without
[15:21] having
[15:22] Faith that's right down there so you see
[15:25] on my chart here I got the very
[15:27] Foundation faith is the foundation of
[15:30] all of it all right but remember and I
[15:32] didn't bring that quote but remember the
[15:34] other quote brother Brown said faith
[15:35] alone won't do it right so faith alone
[15:37] is not going to do it all now scroll it
[15:40] all the way up
[15:41] you're possessed of one that dominates
[15:43] your life which you see it said that's
[15:45] either Faith or doubt
[15:48] so in your soul today in your soul we're
[15:50] talking to the soul of man in your soul
[15:52] today if you're born again it's faith
[15:54] if you're not born again it's doubt it's
[15:57] not faith and doubt it's Faith or doubt
[16:00] all right so there's not two people in
[16:02] your soul
[16:04] for the two Soul people went wrong you
[16:06] were born a living soul
[16:10] born in sin shaping iniquity a spouse
[16:13] from your mother's womb a liar brother
[16:15] Brown said doomed and on your way to
[16:17] hell right
[16:18] right then God comes in and burns that
[16:20] old nature of that soul out puts his
[16:23] soul in and then what it's you and God
[16:25] in there as persons right brother Brown
[16:27] said you in Christ in there as persons
[16:30] but you're possessed of one that
[16:32] dominates your life come on there's the
[16:35] control tower not up here down here
[16:37] right right
[16:39] just depends on how much faith
[16:42] you have how high you can rise all right
[16:46] so it's going to be left up to you you
[16:48] can't come you can't come even as a
[16:50] Christian you can't come up to God one
[16:52] day and say God
[16:54] why didn't you give me Temperance you
[16:56] know what he's going to say you didn't
[16:57] want it
[17:01] how much faith is how high you can rise
[17:05] and God has given us an ability to rise
[17:08] all the way up to the Capstone which is
[17:10] love amen all right so now
[17:13] can you bring up the chart
[17:16] um
[17:17] Brother Anderson to start with there you
[17:19] go now this is the full chart
[17:21] so let's just leave it right there for a
[17:23] little while because we're going to go
[17:24] through them real quick but you must be
[17:26] what Justified and Sanctified and filled
[17:28] with the Holy Ghost to get in this it's
[17:32] not a pyramid teaching
[17:33] but brother Branham used that pyramid as
[17:36] a as a symbol of showing like brother
[17:40] um Joe and I were talking you go over
[17:42] and remember at the very first we read
[17:44] about zerubbable oh thou great Mountain
[17:47] right zerubbable and a mountain that
[17:51] mountain will be a plane it'll start and
[17:53] grow and then The Headstone comes down
[17:56] crying Grace great but the only way to
[17:58] get into that is to what be justified by
[18:01] faith Sanctified by faith and then that
[18:04] faith God honors your faith by bringing
[18:07] the his life into your life is that all
[18:10] right say amen amen that's the way it is
[18:12] you can't come you can't go up here and
[18:15] then try to get down here you can't
[18:17] build that you must build through
[18:19] justification out of court
[18:21] sanctification inner court but the holy
[18:24] of holies is right here that's where God
[18:26] resides is the holy of holies you can
[18:29] have a lot of you can have some of these
[18:31] part of these and be just Sanctified
[18:33] sure but to have virtue Faith you got to
[18:37] have faith first right amen to have
[18:40] knowledge Faith you got to have what
[18:42] faith first Faith got to have faith
[18:45] faith is the whole Foundation now the
[18:48] word faith
[18:50] we looked at in the Greek and we're
[18:52] going to just go through this real quick
[18:53] but everybody see that that was a faith
[18:56] that's the new birth that's the Holy
[18:57] Ghost that's where you start you you
[18:59] cannot start with these virtues without
[19:02] being born again amen the Holy Spirit at
[19:05] the top I'll explain that this that
[19:07] today if the Lord willing all right but
[19:10] the word faith means Assurance or belief
[19:13] you must believe in something
[19:16] remember none of us saw Jesus die on the
[19:18] cross physically right but we must
[19:21] believe that he did and it becomes so
[19:24] much of a belief that we know that he
[19:26] did amen amen so then we accept what he
[19:29] did for us not what we do now what we do
[19:32] is later on
[19:35] works is Faith expressed right all right
[19:38] so we but we must come to a belief first
[19:41] so faith is believing you got to have
[19:44] faith in something
[19:45] amen the whole song You must believe in
[19:48] something or you'll fall for anything
[19:49] and that's what the problem is you got
[19:51] but what you how are you going to
[19:52] believe
[19:53] a five-fold ministry's got to bring you
[19:55] the word of God so you can learn how to
[19:58] believe
[20:01] because we believed in everything else
[20:03] we believed in this and that and the
[20:04] other but when we come and bring a
[20:06] five-fold Ministry that brings the word
[20:08] of God you say God I believe in that you
[20:10] know what he honors that he has to honor
[20:13] his own word
[20:14] hey man then our works then our works is
[20:19] our faith expressed right all right
[20:21] because you can't you can have a whole
[20:24] lot of work
[20:26] but I told you many times before if you
[20:28] look over there in Revelations the ones
[20:30] that are going to be judged they're
[20:31] judged by their works right I don't want
[20:34] to be judged by one work I do right
[20:37] right I want to be judged by The Works
[20:39] that Christ did and that way he's the
[20:42] perfect one so you and I are the perfect
[20:45] one in him
[20:47] amen we're not perfect in ourselves but
[20:49] we're perfect in him that's why we stand
[20:51] in judgment judging because we he took
[20:55] our sins and we accept that
[20:57] right but the ones that come up to the
[20:59] white Throne judgment that don't receive
[21:00] the new birth they have to be judged by
[21:02] The Works they did on the earth and I'm
[21:04] telling you I don't want to be judged by
[21:06] even coming to church and living a good
[21:08] life right amen right so faith is belief
[21:13] now let's go to Virtue now we looked up
[21:15] the word Virtue and we'll not go into
[21:17] the scriptures and will not read what
[21:18] brother random said because we've
[21:19] already done that several times but what
[21:22] did we find out virtue was strength
[21:25] all right it's strength it's power It's
[21:29] ability it's inherent power power
[21:31] residing In A Thing by virtue of its
[21:33] nature or which a person or thing exerts
[21:36] or puts for it Peter didn't have to go
[21:39] call another preacher Peter didn't have
[21:41] to go call the prophet
[21:43] he didn't have to go find Jesus Jesus
[21:45] was in him he said Silver and Gold Have
[21:47] by none but such as I have
[21:49] give I unto thee the power was residing
[21:52] in a Thing Called Peter amen
[21:56] you saw that was for Peter no that was
[21:58] for you amen because we can't have just
[22:01] Faith now we must have strength or a
[22:05] strong faith all right faith alone won't
[22:08] do it you must rise higher and have a
[22:10] strong faith so what so that that virtue
[22:13] or that strength can go out to other
[22:15] people amen now let's go to knowledge
[22:20] knowledge signifies
[22:22] in general intelligence understanding
[22:25] the general knowledge of Christian
[22:27] religion the deeper are more perfect and
[22:29] enlarged knowledge of this religion such
[22:32] as belong to the more advanced now see
[22:34] you went from Faith to Virtue or
[22:35] knowledge you're what you're advancing
[22:37] amen all right you're advancing belongs
[22:39] to the more advanced especially of
[22:41] things lawful and unlawful for
[22:43] Christians now what do we talk about
[22:47] what is discernment right things lawful
[22:49] and unlawful you're judging right now
[22:52] today you're judging whether I'm telling
[22:54] you the truth or not right all right so
[22:56] discernment we saw was a requirement of
[22:59] a Christian
[23:00] you're required to discern every day of
[23:02] your life right all right now when you
[23:04] were out in the world yeah sure you
[23:06] discern things you know you might want
[23:08] to kill that guy
[23:11] but you don't
[23:13] that's just a moral obligation of not
[23:15] killing another man
[23:16] but now you will come up a little higher
[23:19] come up a little higher in the word and
[23:22] Jesus said if you say one word against
[23:24] that person
[23:27] you're killing that influence of that
[23:28] person you've killed that person the
[23:30] prophet of God said same way with with
[23:32] uh you know we used to get away with
[23:34] looking at a woman in lust and after him
[23:36] Jesus said ah you can't get away with
[23:37] that no more because see the Pharisees
[23:39] could say look I've never touched a
[23:40] woman before
[23:42] physically
[23:43] Jesus knew though in their mind
[23:46] that they undress those women all the
[23:48] time
[23:49] because that's what he told him he said
[23:50] now if you look on a woman to lust after
[23:52] you've committed adultery so we're
[23:54] looking at lawful and unlawful for
[23:56] Christians all right that's why the
[23:58] Bible says don't take a Christian to
[23:59] court
[24:01] right
[24:02] judge right here this is where the
[24:04] judgment is right here don't take a
[24:06] Christian to court all right now don't
[24:08] let the people in the world run all over
[24:09] you okay
[24:11] but I'm talking about Christian versus
[24:12] Christians you should never take a
[24:14] Christian to court
[24:15] you should settle it what by the word of
[24:18] God
[24:19] moral wisdom such as seeing and right
[24:21] living but we looked at discernment so
[24:23] now we look at we have we have faith we
[24:27] have virtue faith strong faith now we
[24:29] must have discernment faith
[24:31] okay to discern right from wrong and
[24:34] then we looked at spiritual Insight so
[24:36] you've got to have not just not just
[24:39] that I can do calculus
[24:40] knowledge that I can take Matthew 28 19
[24:43] and Acts 2 38 and see that they say the
[24:46] exact same thing amen that it's not two
[24:49] different things it's the exact see that
[24:52] to me that spiritual discernment but see
[24:54] spiritual discernment has been lost down
[24:57] Through the Ages by Creeds and dogmas
[24:59] and they said no that's not this is the
[25:01] way you do it and this is not so they've
[25:02] lost that spiritual discernment but God
[25:05] never lost his spiritual discernment the
[25:08] people just lost it because of what
[25:11] teaching
[25:12] the teaching of the people in the church
[25:14] ages down to not not the Christians but
[25:16] the ones that's made denominations set
[25:19] barriers right and they discerned wrong
[25:22] they did not have spiritual insight and
[25:24] brother Branham told us in the church
[25:25] age book that we must be Spirit have
[25:28] spiritual Insight in the end time or
[25:30] we'll get caught with some of these
[25:32] doctrines all right so now knowledge
[25:35] is discernment Faith all right now
[25:37] temperance we looked at the word
[25:39] Temperance and we all talked about
[25:41] Temperance being temper and things like
[25:43] that but for the ones that have not been
[25:46] here
[25:48] it is how to control your ungodly temper
[25:50] but it's also self-control of everything
[25:54] all right all right so it's a controlled
[25:57] faith
[25:59] Jesus had a control faith says the
[26:01] virtue of one who Masters his desires
[26:03] and passions especially essential
[26:06] appetite mastering controlling curbing
[26:08] restraining controlling oneself
[26:10] temperate our continent that means
[26:14] control everything control your tongue
[26:15] control all the things that you have
[26:17] around you but Jesus one time I I look
[26:20] at it like like that is when when Jesus
[26:23] was laying asleep in the boat
[26:25] and the you know all heck was breaking
[26:27] Loops outside there was uh uh the
[26:30] disciples were actually saying how can
[26:33] you sleep when this is going on
[26:35] well he had so much of a controlled
[26:37] Faith to all he done he got up and he
[26:39] said where's your faith
[26:41] he said peace be still
[26:43] he would come up to a demon and a demon
[26:46] would come and a demon would actually
[26:47] speak back and said thou Son of God
[26:50] there was so much of a controlled Faith
[26:53] there until Jesus didn't need to call
[26:58] he had that control faith you look at
[27:01] brother Branham when he walks in he says
[27:03] look I take every Spirit under my
[27:06] control see he was using that Temperance
[27:09] faith that he had he was using that
[27:10] controlling faith not to control you as
[27:13] mind over matter there's no way for God
[27:15] God doesn't do that that's the devil
[27:19] right right so that's what the devil
[27:21] tries to do the devil tries to get in
[27:22] there and control you but look it says
[27:25] self-control so it's got to come from
[27:26] what South
[27:28] all right self-control which is a
[27:30] controlled faith that all these things
[27:33] we were talking about
[27:35] um I was talking about in The Prayer you
[27:36] know you got downstairs we've got the
[27:38] wall with all of our children and our
[27:40] husbands and wives and all that are that
[27:42] are down under my feet here in the
[27:44] Sunday school class
[27:47] they're all looking for you
[27:50] to be in control
[27:52] see once you get out of control
[27:55] that's the first thing they're going to
[27:56] look at you start popping off at the lip
[27:59] and you start doing all these things all
[28:00] right kids are going to look at that and
[28:02] going to say wow do I want what he's got
[28:05] it okay right
[28:07] as for all others comes from up here
[28:09] back there
[28:11] we all need that self-control that look
[28:13] God you said it I believe it
[28:17] and let's just walk into it all right
[28:19] amen because that's what we got to do
[28:21] because if we look if Abraham looked at
[28:23] his circumstance he could have never
[28:25] produced that child but he came to a
[28:27] place he said God
[28:29] I can't do it you're gonna have to do it
[28:30] for me
[28:33] amen so controlled faith sure we have
[28:37] need to control our temper God is the
[28:39] only one who can do that because see
[28:40] we're fighting against that old nature
[28:41] the old nature is being we're fighting
[28:43] against it in all these we're fighting
[28:46] against all the uh the natural things of
[28:49] the world but God listen God has given
[28:51] us provision
[28:53] these promises told us how to what to
[28:55] get and how to get it so it's left up to
[28:58] me and you to say God I want you to
[29:01] control my temper I want you to control
[29:03] my whatever
[29:07] it's a controlled faith brother Branham
[29:10] you know the maniac comes running up the
[29:12] the aisle you know and a huge man and he
[29:15] says 200 preachers just left the pulpit
[29:19] they didn't have a lot of control
[29:23] but one man stood there and he said
[29:25] something came from what inside I was
[29:27] reading it the other day something came
[29:28] from here
[29:30] and he said you'll fall at my feet and
[29:32] still the demon said no I'm gonna I'm
[29:34] gonna break you in half and throw you
[29:35] off this pulpit and he said you'll fall
[29:37] at my feet well see that's a controlled
[29:40] temperate faith and that's what you and
[29:42] I must have because listen it's not
[29:44] going to get any easier
[29:46] the devil's going to get closer and
[29:48] closer and closer and closer and we're
[29:51] gonna have to have that controlled Faith
[29:53] to not be so out of control
[29:57] that's a good one all right you got to
[30:00] have control faith
[30:01] right
[30:04] now let's go to patience
[30:07] we saw patience with steadfastness
[30:10] constancy endurance all right in the New
[30:13] Testament the characteristics of a man
[30:15] who is not swerved from his deliberate
[30:17] purpose and his loyalty to Faith you
[30:20] never lose that so we're looking at
[30:22] patience faith our enduring faith our
[30:25] perseverant faith which is what the
[30:28] greatest trials in South piety by even
[30:30] the greatest trials and suffering
[30:31] because remember the Bible says the
[30:33] trial of your faith is more precious
[30:35] than gold and you're going to be tried
[30:38] tribulation I didn't put this in here
[30:40] but remember tribulation worketh what
[30:43] patience so you are going to have right
[30:46] here you're going to have to go through
[30:49] some tribulation
[30:51] remember this is not spoons and forks
[30:54] this is knives and swords and man we're
[30:58] not going to do it in a picnic it's
[30:59] going to be a bottle that we got to go
[31:01] through so you got to go through a
[31:03] battle but remember you must have
[31:06] endurance Paul said
[31:08] I come to the end of my road I run my I
[31:10] run my race and a Crown of Life Waits on
[31:13] me he knew he had patience and look the
[31:15] first thing brother Brown said do what
[31:17] have patience with who God right amen
[31:19] that God would do what he said he would
[31:21] do and then next have patience with the
[31:23] people all right
[31:25] but steadfastness now let's go to
[31:28] Godliness
[31:30] we spoke on Garland this couple of
[31:31] Sundays ago
[31:33] excuse me
[31:36] we saw that it was reverence respect
[31:40] piety towards God and remember what we
[31:42] talked about we talked about in
[31:44] godliness we talked about what respect
[31:49] respect for the gifts of God all right
[31:52] because you got to be Godly down here
[31:54] because you're talking about life and
[31:55] godliness
[31:57] you got to start acting like God once
[31:59] God comes in you all right but when you
[32:01] come here you have respect for what God
[32:04] give you to me that's to me that's a
[32:06] revelation it's respect for the gifts of
[32:09] God and you know what it's a respect for
[32:11] the gift that God gave you
[32:15] remember power without character is
[32:18] satanic that's right but Power with
[32:20] character is spit to rule now who you
[32:22] got to rule first
[32:27] you got to rule this first
[32:29] amen if you don't rule this first
[32:32] you forget about everything else right
[32:35] right all right so now let's go to uh
[32:37] the quote there number two and let's
[32:39] just we're going to background a little
[32:40] bit more with godliness
[32:42] umbrella kindness because we kind of
[32:43] flew through them last Sunday or Sunday
[32:45] two weeks ago fifth
[32:47] so my godliness to be added what does
[32:50] godliness mean I looked four or five
[32:51] dictionaries and couldn't even find what
[32:53] it meant finally I was down at brother
[32:55] Jeffrey's there we found it in her
[32:56] dictionary godliness means to be like
[32:58] God right all right oh my after you get
[33:01] Faith virtue and all his temper's
[33:02] patience then be like God
[33:04] he says sure you say I can't do that
[33:07] brother Branham
[33:09] this is the prophet we we we we
[33:13] he said right right I mean he wasn't
[33:15] wrong right he was sent to tell us what
[33:18] God Said right
[33:19] read that with me oh yes you can
[33:27] I don't need to read no more oh guess oh
[33:30] yes you can
[33:31] you know why because that Prophet was
[33:33] the mouthpiece of God he caught the mind
[33:36] of God and you know who said that God
[33:38] said that
[33:40] through a prophet I can't do that
[33:42] brother Brown oh yes you can right
[33:45] right then he talks about the scriptures
[33:46] what he goes right back to
[33:49] be therefore perfect
[33:52] and then he goes to
[33:55] what we read in Ephesians where Apostles
[33:57] prophets pastors teaches evangelists you
[33:59] get way up here now before you're asked
[34:01] to do that see you're not asked to have
[34:03] respect for the gift or to act Godly
[34:05] until you get way up there you get way
[34:07] up here before you're asked to do that
[34:09] all these things has to be added first
[34:12] right then when you get up here he asks
[34:16] you now to be perfect godliness Sons and
[34:19] Daughters of God then how many things he
[34:22] could say about on that line and we'll
[34:24] leave it there because
[34:26] it's a respect it's a respect knowing
[34:28] that God look when you get right here
[34:30] look what God's packed into you already
[34:33] right look what should be working in
[34:35] your life and what God has what he has
[34:38] he has said you're able
[34:41] to do these things and I'm going to give
[34:44] them to you because I know what you'll
[34:46] do with them when I give them to you
[34:47] right see this is why you get right here
[34:50] and you say well what that's respect for
[34:52] the gifts that God's already give you
[34:54] right you got that say amen that's the
[34:58] that's that's look what a what a
[35:00] wonderful God that gives us a new birth
[35:04] but he wants us to do more
[35:06] he doesn't want us to stay babies he
[35:08] wants us to be somebody that can respect
[35:11] the gifts of God and respect what God
[35:13] has already give you and you know what
[35:15] it doesn't put you up here
[35:18] if it does you're not down there
[35:22] if it puts you swells your head up
[35:25] you're not up here you're going to you
[35:27] need to go right back down here and get
[35:29] some of this then you're going to have
[35:31] respect or or be humble that God would
[35:35] even give you these things but you know
[35:38] what brother dick if God give them to
[35:39] you he know what you'll do with them
[35:40] right
[35:42] so if he's give those gifts to you and
[35:43] God said look
[35:45] you've got temperance and you realize
[35:48] you got Temperance you thank God that
[35:50] God was that God was had enough to give
[35:54] you that gift and then you in return you
[35:56] just let them work
[35:59] you're you're the vessel to let them
[36:01] work okay God doesn't want you to keep
[36:03] all these things inside
[36:06] right
[36:08] virtue goes out
[36:10] knowledge goes out
[36:12] ten percent patience that's something we
[36:15] got to work on godliness is something we
[36:18] got to work on probably kind of
[36:19] something we got to work on so he starts
[36:21] out with you able to give these things
[36:23] out but these things up to here you work
[36:25] in here and then watch what's going to
[36:27] happen up here when we get up to where
[36:29] God can really use you
[36:31] as a as a true vessel of God Amen not
[36:34] that you're not a true vessel down here
[36:36] remember those words true and and is not
[36:40] like true versus false because you're
[36:41] going to read in here we're going to
[36:42] read brother Brown said the true baptism
[36:44] of the Holy Ghost comes on you right
[36:46] there that doesn't mean you receive the
[36:48] false
[36:49] New Birth because remember in Revelation
[36:51] 3 14 says the faithful and true witness
[36:53] now there never was a time that Jesus
[36:56] Christ was wrong and had to be true
[37:00] so he's the faithful and true witness in
[37:03] other words it ring everything Rings
[37:04] just right yeah yeah all right because
[37:07] remember you're faithful and true
[37:09] witness here but my what God wants to do
[37:11] for you man I said before I I love our
[37:14] little children like they are but but
[37:16] God forbid if I want them to stay that
[37:18] way that's not God's plan it's for you
[37:20] to be is to stay a child they're cute
[37:22] and beautiful but God wants you to grow
[37:24] up
[37:25] into God
[37:27] hey man so now brotherly kindness
[37:32] the godliness remember what we said
[37:34] godliness was was what respect respect
[37:37] for the gift of God now brotherly
[37:38] kindness
[37:39] let's read a couple of scriptures here
[37:42] because like I said we wanted to get to
[37:44] get a little bit of this
[37:48] because I want you I want you to see
[37:49] something today uh that that was in the
[37:52] back that I kind of wanted to I didn't
[37:54] know how to go last week but or now I
[37:56] kind of know how to go let love be
[37:58] without dissimulation abhor that which
[38:00] is evil cleave to that which is good
[38:02] Romans 12 9-10 be kindly affection one
[38:06] to another with Brotherly Love in honor
[38:08] preferring one another all right so that
[38:11] that pretty much sums it up let's go to
[38:13] first Thessalonians
[38:15] which should be the next one he
[38:18] therefore that despises despise is not
[38:20] man but God
[38:23] remember be careful
[38:25] be careful
[38:27] ananas and Sapphira they didn't lie to
[38:29] Peter
[38:32] they lied to the Holy Ghost
[38:34] Peter probably had compassion for him as
[38:36] a human being but the Holy Ghost took
[38:39] over and said you lied to the Holy Ghost
[38:41] you didn't lie to me lie to Peter amen
[38:43] so you despise not man but God
[38:47] so like who was it that said God they've
[38:49] turned me down was it one of the
[38:50] prophets in the Old Testament uh Samuel
[38:52] or one of them said Lord they've turned
[38:53] me down he said no land turned you down
[38:54] he said they turned me down through you
[38:57] right that's why I said look right here
[39:00] let's go back to here respect for the
[39:02] gifts
[39:03] all right you learn to have respect for
[39:05] the gifts because I'm going to tell you
[39:06] something we can be taken off this Earth
[39:08] if we don't have respect for the gift of
[39:10] God right we can still be Christians I'm
[39:12] going to read you I'm going to read you
[39:13] something here in just a minute
[39:15] because I had some questions people ask
[39:17] me some questions about certain certain
[39:19] things about how to handle them and
[39:21] maybe we'll touch on that you know what
[39:22] if we don't get to it this afternoon
[39:23] we'll get to this afternoon uh later on
[39:26] but as touching brotherly love you need
[39:28] not that I write unto you for ye
[39:30] yourselves are taught of God to love one
[39:33] another amen
[39:35] now
[39:38] let's let's look at something here
[39:41] that love is not filial love
[39:47] for those of you that don't know what
[39:48] filial love is feel your love is the
[39:50] love I have for my wife it's it's it's
[39:52] bordering on feelings emotions lust and
[39:56] all those things is that okay but agape
[39:58] love has nothing to do
[40:00] with any of that okay agape love is you
[40:04] love one another now it doesn't say we
[40:07] have to tolerate one another
[40:14] I'm gonna read you I'm more let's let's
[40:16] we'll read it
[40:18] that was a situation in the Bible
[40:20] with two Born Again Holy Ghost Phil
[40:24] Paul and Barnabas
[40:26] they had a problem
[40:28] for ye yourselves are taught of God to
[40:30] love
[40:31] one another all right the Greek word for
[40:34] that though is watch it's Philadelphia
[40:35] but it's Brotherly Love or brother kind
[40:38] of so you can use both of that love of
[40:40] the brethren
[40:42] now that's not love that's what I said
[40:43] let's not feel your love you shouldn't
[40:45] have that that's what happened in the
[40:46] world they're having love for the
[40:48] Brethren out there and it's called
[40:51] homosexuality
[40:53] you see how Satan perverts it though I'm
[40:55] not being funny Satan perverted that he
[40:58] took that true love of God and now he's
[41:00] turned it into what the Bible says
[41:02] lasciviousness are men laying with men
[41:04] women laying with women he's turned that
[41:06] thing around and brought it from agape
[41:09] love that's what I said many times about
[41:10] Adam and Eve agape love had to take over
[41:13] Adam to not destroy Eve
[41:15] right I feel your love had nothing to do
[41:18] with that right no sex no anything like
[41:20] that you understand what I'm talking
[41:21] about
[41:24] the sex between Adam and Eve didn't save
[41:25] Eve
[41:27] it actually polluted her more and it
[41:29] polluted me and you
[41:30] because Adam sees what polluted the
[41:32] world not easy
[41:35] I know there's a Doctrine out there in
[41:36] the message that Adam had to had to have
[41:39] sexual relations with Eve to save her
[41:43] there's nothing in God
[41:45] of sex for salvation you can forget that
[41:48] Brothers I'm going to tell you something
[41:49] acts like brother that's like brother
[41:51] Joel said that's a false teaching
[41:55] I got enough knowledge to realize that
[41:57] sex don't save nothing sex is what kills
[42:00] us all right that's what gives us a
[42:02] nature I wouldn't have to preach this if
[42:03] all y'all was born right
[42:11] we wouldn't have to go to church
[42:16] don't get no idea
[42:18] but this is the love of brothers and
[42:20] sisters Brotherly Love in the New
[42:22] Testament the love which Christians
[42:23] cherish for each other
[42:26] as Brethren all right so now let's go
[42:29] to number three and read
[42:32] what brother Brandon said I will restore
[42:34] this is not in the Statue of perfect man
[42:35] this is before the statue of perfect man
[42:37] but watch what he says now he's talking
[42:40] about Pentecost was God's buying Ace
[42:41] talking about original Pentecost not
[42:43] 1906 but original Pentecost all right
[42:46] which was back at where in Paul's age
[42:48] all right now the first thing that
[42:50] Pentecost produced was brotherly love it
[42:53] tore down the middle wall of partitions
[42:56] and made a Brotherhood a real
[42:58] Brotherhood you see how Satan perverts
[43:00] all this he puts you into he'll put you
[43:02] into the Masonic Lodge or he'll put you
[43:04] into this or he'll put they say well
[43:06] it's a Brotherhood that's a Brotherhood
[43:07] see how Satan twists that thing and
[43:09] turns it around but there is a true
[43:11] Brotherhood in God and Sisterhood all
[43:14] right to such a way that they had
[43:16] everything in common
[43:20] now we're going to look at in a minute
[43:22] that word common is a good word to use
[43:24] you say well now that puts no well
[43:26] common does it puts everything level
[43:29] right because we're going to read
[43:30] tonight even when you start in the
[43:32] adoption stage that your join heirs with
[43:35] Christ now watch John heirs with Christ
[43:36] him up hearing you down here
[43:38] the Bible says that's not me the Bible
[43:41] says your Heir and join air with Jesus
[43:44] Christ that makes you whatever Jesus
[43:46] gets that's what you get amen
[43:49] so that brings everything in common a
[43:51] Brotherhood all right in the Bible days
[43:54] roll it all roll it up Pentecost had
[43:56] that I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the
[43:59] first group of Apostles and the
[44:00] disciples they had that Brotherly Love
[44:03] they wasn't greedy
[44:06] will make you greedy
[44:10] make you jealous
[44:12] right
[44:13] that's what brother Brown said you know
[44:15] somebody touch your wife and you're
[44:16] you're a sinner somebody touch your wife
[44:18] you want to kill him
[44:19] somebody touch your wife now as a
[44:21] Christian you want to pray for the man
[44:24] don't let him do it again but you want
[44:25] to pray for him
[44:27] pray for his bleeding
[44:30] pray for the broken bones
[44:34] and pray that he don't fall again like
[44:36] he fell the first time
[44:38] with your help
[44:41] but look they sold everything and for
[44:43] the ones of you that weren't here
[44:45] they sold everything they had for the
[44:48] white the furthermen of the church
[44:51] always together
[44:53] until even when one heard of the other
[44:55] one died they said let us go and die
[44:58] with him now that's not filial love
[45:00] that's agape love that takes over
[45:03] because look how close you are to that
[45:05] agape love here now remember it's all
[45:07] agape love all the way down
[45:10] amen because when you receive the new
[45:12] birth you receive a part of God which is
[45:14] agape love all right but remember we're
[45:18] going to read it this afternoon about in
[45:19] this stages of adoption your son
[45:22] and you're an heir but you got to grow
[45:25] up right amen you got to grow up let us
[45:29] go and die with him
[45:30] such a feeling so they had a common
[45:34] Faith or a commonness and that's the
[45:37] same way with brotherly kindness and
[45:39] there is a quote I was trying to find
[45:40] where brother Brown said there are some
[45:41] people Christians that you can't stand
[45:43] to be in a room with
[45:45] you it's just this old nature is still
[45:47] fighting people
[45:48] you're still fighting sorry it is
[45:52] but you must love with agape love
[45:55] because remember we're supposed to love
[45:57] the sinner but hate the sin right well
[46:00] when you love that sinner that's cursing
[46:02] you and doing all these things number
[46:03] one you better have some control faith
[46:06] to control your temper
[46:08] but it but if you do overcome that you
[46:11] look in the eyes of God God looked in
[46:13] the eyes of Jesus Christ and it was the
[46:16] same eyes right but he was looking at
[46:18] true human beings he said father forgive
[46:20] them they don't know what they're doing
[46:22] right all right so that's what you and I
[46:24] must do to come to the place to where
[46:26] father forgive them they do not know
[46:28] what they're doing all right now I
[46:29] looked up the word common I wanted to uh
[46:32] to look that up
[46:34] and um
[46:36] because I wanted to find the word common
[46:38] if you'll pull that up
[46:39] we'll read it
[46:41] from Good Old Merriam-Webster's
[46:44] Dictionary belonging to or shared by two
[46:47] or more people or groups
[46:49] done by many people occurring or
[46:52] appearing frequently not rare I like
[46:54] that
[46:57] right
[46:58] occurring or appearing frequently
[47:01] of relating to a community at large
[47:03] public work for the common good known to
[47:05] the community belonging to or shared by
[47:08] two or more individuals or things are by
[47:10] all members of a group common friends
[47:12] are higher than or buried in a common
[47:14] grave belonging equally
[47:17] to two or more mathematical entities
[47:20] occurring or appearing it goes back
[47:22] again look look at this word
[47:26] familiar right
[47:29] we become familiar
[47:31] with who first God which is the author
[47:33] of Brotherly Love because he loved you
[47:37] when you hated him
[47:39] that's agape love
[47:42] God doesn't have feel your love
[47:45] it's agape love and then Satan watered
[47:47] it down to where it comes down to where
[47:49] God finally you know God
[47:51] God said okay you're gonna have to have
[47:54] feel your love because I bring you in
[47:56] the world now because I can't bring you
[47:58] here through agape love agape love is
[47:59] speaking the word of God Amen filio love
[48:03] is coming through sex desire and all
[48:05] those things but you know what it got
[48:06] you here to make a choice
[48:08] right so you're here to make a choice so
[48:10] you come to brotherly kindness and you
[48:13] look it says familiar a common sight
[48:15] listen we all have a common goal but
[48:18] it's like I was telling brother Joe and
[48:20] them last Sunday I'm not a I'm not a an
[48:23] evangelist I know that I don't have a
[48:25] pull to bring people to the altar like
[48:27] brother Joel Forney and some of those
[48:29] I don't want to be in that gift right
[48:31] because that's not what the way God made
[48:32] me he geared me to be able to I can
[48:34] break the word down and maybe teach the
[48:36] people and bring you know let let
[48:38] brother Louise bring him in
[48:41] that's why I was Illustrated let brother
[48:42] wait let an evangelist bring him in
[48:45] but somebody once you bring them in he's
[48:46] got to bring him up right
[48:48] right amen you can bring them in and be
[48:51] Spirit babies in Christ that's where you
[48:53] got to start from but somebody's got to
[48:55] come and then teach them
[48:58] the school Master brought him to Christ
[49:00] we'll talk about that this afternoon the
[49:01] school Master brought him to Christ
[49:02] convicted their heart brought them to
[49:04] the altar but somebody's got to what be
[49:07] a tutor and a governor to bring the
[49:09] people up in God because God doesn't
[49:12] want you to stay one more time doesn't
[49:13] want you to stay a baby
[49:16] so listen
[49:17] to say all all that to say this Paul
[49:20] and Barnabas if you'll read if you'll
[49:23] read about Barnabas in the book of Acts
[49:24] he was a man the Bible said full of the
[49:26] Holy Ghost going around doing signs and
[49:29] wonders right
[49:30] Paul obviously we know he was a prophet
[49:33] right yeah man Paul was the prophet of
[49:35] the church age all right look Paul also
[49:37] in Barnabas continued in Antioch
[49:39] teaching and preaching the word of the
[49:40] Lord with many others also and some days
[49:43] after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go
[49:45] again and visit our brethren in every
[49:46] city where we'll preach the word of God
[49:48] they preached together for years three
[49:51] to four years they were together
[49:52] everywhere they went and signs and
[49:54] wonders followed them two Holy Ghost
[49:56] filled gentlemen see how and see how
[49:59] they do and Barnabas determined to take
[50:01] with him John whose surname was Mark but
[50:04] Paul thought not good to take him with
[50:06] them who departed from them from papalea
[50:09] and went not with them to the work
[50:13] and the contention was so sharp between
[50:16] them that they departed asunder one from
[50:20] the other they didn't go together
[50:21] anymore they separated right
[50:24] and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed
[50:27] under Cyprus if you continue reading
[50:28] they still were successful
[50:31] okay so you can't you know even
[50:34] I like hunting and fishing but I I don't
[50:37] care much about you know flying kites or
[50:39] something like that so if you want to
[50:41] talk about flying kites I'll talk to you
[50:43] for a little while
[50:45] that's human stuff but now listen we
[50:47] should all they never had a contention
[50:49] over the word of God
[50:52] Paul and Peter never had a contention
[50:54] over the word of God Paul was telling
[50:56] Peter said look Peter you're not
[50:59] treating them people right in other
[51:01] words Paul was saying now Peter remember
[51:03] what you said
[51:06] Peter remember what you said because
[51:09] remember we have to be reminded
[51:13] we have to be reminded Peter had to be
[51:16] reminded of what position he was
[51:18] supposed to be in and it took a prophet
[51:21] to do that same thing with you and I
[51:23] took a prophet brother random to bring
[51:25] us to a place to see that we needed
[51:28] these and to what as we grow up through
[51:31] there somebody to say look you're not
[51:33] acting you know acting right
[51:35] but the contention was so sharp between
[51:38] them they departed so see you say well
[51:40] that's not brotherly kindness well
[51:41] obviously Paul had it
[51:44] okay so we can't look at brotherly
[51:46] kindness where we love everybody in the
[51:48] way we think
[51:50] that love should be all right there are
[51:53] some people you put up with
[51:55] there are some people that that you have
[51:57] differences but now look if it's ever a
[52:00] doctrinal difference there's a problem
[52:01] right
[52:03] right there's a doctrinal difference
[52:05] there's a problem right I got a problem
[52:07] with somebody that preaches a different
[52:08] Doctrine than what the pastor preaches
[52:10] in his church I told somebody the other
[52:12] day you know brother Brown said the
[52:13] Deacon is the policeman of the church
[52:15] and if a man comes in and preaches a
[52:17] Doctrine that's different than the
[52:18] doctrine of the church he's to handle it
[52:20] not the pastor
[52:22] that's what he said you're supposed to
[52:23] go to that person and tell them that
[52:25] that is not what the pastor or the
[52:28] teaching of this church is so we fell
[52:31] short as Deacon's doing that
[52:33] but listen but you gotta you gotta be
[52:35] able to discern
[52:37] whether that's it or not we've had you
[52:39] know we've had things preached in the in
[52:41] the Pulpit here that was that was a
[52:43] little bit uh off and uh you know you
[52:47] love the brother though
[52:49] you love the brother see you still can
[52:51] have Brotherly Love uh you know I and I
[52:54] want you to pray about I got a little
[52:55] something that that I am feeling that's
[52:58] going to go on in the Philippines but
[52:59] we'll see I've been praying about it but
[53:01] we'll see about how that feeling goes
[53:03] because some of those Brothers have
[53:05] preaching things in here I don't care if
[53:07] they know it or not they preach things
[53:09] in this Pulpit that's not exactly
[53:10] correct to the doctrine of of brother
[53:12] Branham so I I we may be questioned on
[53:15] that and we may not but we'll see but
[53:18] remember
[53:19] they may throw me off the island but I'm
[53:21] going to believe what I believe
[53:26] and I'm not saying anything against them
[53:27] you understand what I mean it may be
[53:30] that we can because one of the brothers
[53:31] wants to have a questions and answer
[53:33] session I don't know where that comes
[53:34] from so if he wants to have a question
[53:36] and answer session there must be some
[53:37] questions
[53:39] and there's got to be some answers so so
[53:41] we just you just pray for me that that
[53:43] I'll get me out that I'll leave me here
[53:45] and gotta go do it you know because you
[53:48] know me I don't have a lot of Brotherly
[53:49] kindness yet so
[53:52] I admit that
[53:57] I'm trying
[54:00] listen y'all have to tolerate me so I
[54:02] might as well tolerate y'all
[54:05] but look brotherly kindness is not not
[54:07] all sweetness and beautiful you
[54:08] understand what I'm saying this is my
[54:10] point it's not all uh you know roses uh
[54:14] because if you put your hand in a rose
[54:15] you can see in my hands I pruned some
[54:17] roses over at sister Julie's house the
[54:19] other day and I kind of brought some
[54:21] Thorns back with me so there's some
[54:23] thorns and among those Roses
[54:25] roses are pretty but and smell good but
[54:27] they have a few thorns in them but
[54:29] remember what we're supposed to do is
[54:30] though bottom line with brotherly
[54:32] kindness we're supposed to take out all
[54:35] the feelings
[54:37] we're supposed to take the lay the
[54:38] feelings aside that's what we're really
[54:40] supposed to do lay the feelings aside
[54:42] and love the person and I say brother
[54:44] but you sisters got to do the same thing
[54:45] right right all right your sisters we
[54:47] you know we you say well you've got
[54:49] you're supposed to do it this way or
[54:51] this is the right way well you know you
[54:53] go by the word of God because two
[54:55] people's not going to agree on worldly
[54:58] common not worldly but common things
[54:59] they're not going to agree that's why I
[55:01] said you got to have we'll come back to
[55:03] this you got to have common faith
[55:06] because common Faith brings the word of
[55:08] God on a level plane to everybody
[55:11] understand what I'm saying so brotherly
[55:13] kindness is not that you just see I and
[55:16] I don't
[55:17] here I go
[55:19] you know these people that come up so
[55:21] Meek and humble and you know they got
[55:23] their Bible like brother Branham and
[55:25] they sneak up on you I can't I ain't
[55:33] I want someone
[55:34] tell me what they believe
[55:38] and then I'll determine whether it goes
[55:40] through my filter or not I'll determine
[55:42] whether it's right or not
[55:44] all right all right so I like what the
[55:46] Bible says be bold
[55:49] be bold be confident that's what they
[55:50] said about me and brother Dale that
[55:52] ministers meeting they said they're
[55:53] they're arrogant and one brother got up
[55:55] and he said no they're not arrogant
[55:56] they're just confident there's a
[55:58] difference in arrogance and confidence
[56:01] I'm confident I was taught right
[56:04] so so I just have confidence that God
[56:06] and you know what God will back it up or
[56:08] he'll whip me one of the two you just
[56:10] leave that to God let him do it you
[56:11] don't have to do it he'll do it for you
[56:12] all right amen
[56:15] all right so now excuse me
[56:18] everybody all right with those so we got
[56:21] faith we got then we got virtue Faith
[56:23] knowledge Faith Temperance Faith because
[56:25] you never leave faith patience Faith
[56:28] godliness faith and brotherly kindness
[56:30] faith and we're going to look at this
[56:32] this evening we'll bring it all up and I
[56:34] want to bring all these definitions into
[56:36] the pyramid but let's talk about the
[56:38] Holy Spirit here for about 10 minutes
[56:40] and then we'll continue on this
[56:42] afternoon because we need to get out a
[56:44] little bit early to let brother down
[56:45] sister Dale eat and uh and don't worry
[56:48] about it we're going to have church
[56:50] at two o'clock we're gonna have church
[56:52] you can pray for brother Dale and let
[56:54] him you know let him go do what he needs
[56:56] to do with his family and and uh and the
[56:58] rest of us are going to have church with
[57:00] the church family
[57:02] Jesus said let the Dead bear the Dead
[57:05] now that's not being arrogant
[57:08] but your first duty is right here
[57:11] if you have a duty in this church
[57:14] if you have an office in this church
[57:15] this is your first Duty unless you get
[57:17] somebody to take your place and then you
[57:19] go like like Sunday school Bob asked me
[57:21] this morning he said well who's going to
[57:22] do this I said that's your problem
[57:26] that's yours not mine it's your problem
[57:28] it'll be my problem when I get back but
[57:30] it's his problem until I get back
[57:35] you got to build confidence and we all
[57:37] need to have confidence
[57:39] in that God is God never gonna he's
[57:41] never gonna tell you wrong
[57:44] and through a true faithful Ministry
[57:46] he's never going to tell you wrong so
[57:48] you must have confidence
[57:51] in the ability
[57:53] for God to send it through this got to
[57:55] go through this filter and then go out
[57:57] all right all right look but speaking
[57:59] the truth in love
[58:01] let's talk about the Holy Spirit now
[58:02] we're going to talk about the Holy
[58:04] Spirit right here just for a few minutes
[58:06] about 10 minutes from but speaking the
[58:10] truth in love
[58:12] May grow up into him now what's he
[58:14] talking about see he's continuing look
[58:16] for that Ephesians 4 and 12 is where we
[58:19] read he gave Apostles prophets Pastor
[58:21] teaching advantages now this is a
[58:23] continuation of what Paul's speaking of
[58:25] in the book of Ephesus now remember the
[58:27] Ephesians was what a very mature Church
[58:29] all right so they were understanding
[58:31] what Paul was saying but speaking the
[58:33] truth in love may grow up into him in
[58:36] all things which is the head even Christ
[58:38] Now where's the head right here the head
[58:40] even Christ all right from whom the
[58:43] whole body fitly joined together and
[58:47] compacted not just put together but
[58:50] compacted you take that thing and you
[58:52] pack it down well once you pack
[58:55] something what happens you can't get a
[58:57] razor blade in between the the pyramid
[58:58] uh rocks over there right so same thing
[59:02] with God if you leave a crack and
[59:03] there's many quotes where brother Brown
[59:05] said you get up this far and you fall
[59:07] off why because you've left the crack
[59:09] somewhere
[59:10] and who you know who fills those cracks
[59:15] your friend the devil
[59:21] yeah
[59:23] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[59:26] together and compacted by that which
[59:30] every joint supplies
[59:32] so it's got to come from the inside out
[59:34] right right
[59:36] according to the effectual working in
[59:38] the measure of every part
[59:41] these things are important this thing is
[59:43] important all these things are important
[59:45] all right but remember when we have
[59:46] brotherly kindness it puts everybody on
[59:48] the same level all right and the measure
[59:50] of every part maketh increase of the
[59:52] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[59:55] all right this I say therefore in
[59:58] testify in the Lord that ye henceforth
[1:00:00] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:00:03] vanity of their mind
[1:00:05] having their understanding darkened
[1:00:07] being alienated from the life of God
[1:00:10] through what the ignorance that is in
[1:00:12] them because of the blindness of their
[1:00:15] heart
[1:00:16] who being past feeling have given
[1:00:18] themselves over into lasciviousness is
[1:00:19] what we were just talking about a minute
[1:00:20] ago to work all uncleanliness with
[1:00:23] greediness now that ain't got nothing to
[1:00:25] do with statue of perfect man but watch
[1:00:27] but
[1:00:29] ye have not so learned Christ in other
[1:00:31] words you didn't learn this from Christ
[1:00:34] you didn't learn this from God all right
[1:00:36] if so be that you have heard him and
[1:00:38] have been taught by him as the truth is
[1:00:40] in Jesus that you put off concerning the
[1:00:43] former conversation of the old man
[1:00:45] which is corrupt according to the
[1:00:47] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:00:50] spirit of your mind and that you put on
[1:00:52] the new man which after God is what
[1:00:55] created
[1:00:56] created me a clean heart
[1:00:59] oh God which after God is created in
[1:01:02] what righteousness and true Holiness all
[1:01:05] right this is kind of long but listen
[1:01:06] wherefore putting away lying speaking
[1:01:09] every man truth with his neighbor for we
[1:01:11] are members one another be angry and sin
[1:01:14] not Paul I believe is going right
[1:01:16] through the virtues right here be angry
[1:01:19] and sin not let not the sun go down upon
[1:01:21] your wrath so it's telling you how to
[1:01:22] handle temperance neither give place to
[1:01:25] the devil let him that stall still no
[1:01:28] more
[1:01:28] right that's pretty simple
[1:01:30] but very profound but rather let him
[1:01:33] labor working with his hands the things
[1:01:34] which is good that he may have to give
[1:01:37] to him that needeth in other words
[1:01:40] you're able to give right
[1:01:42] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:01:44] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:01:46] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:01:49] Grace unto the hearers and grieve not
[1:01:53] the holy spirit of God whereby ye are
[1:01:55] sealed
[1:01:56] unto the day of Redemption all right so
[1:02:02] we can grieve it
[1:02:03] we received the new birth right here
[1:02:06] we can grieve God away in any of these

[1:03:10] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:03:12] as God for Christ's sake has forgiven
[1:03:14] you I'm sure when Paul and Barnabas
[1:03:16] separated there was something in their
[1:03:18] heart
[1:03:20] that Paul probably said Lord forgive
[1:03:22] Barnabas he really didn't you know he
[1:03:24] didn't know what he was doing and I'm
[1:03:25] sure Barnabas didn't God forgive Paul or
[1:03:28] forgive me you know

[1:05:55] building a what a perfect church for the
[1:05:58] Capstone to cap it off what's it been
[1:06:02] done it's manifestation through seven
[1:06:03] Church ages and seven Church Messengers
[1:06:05] starting back here what was the church
[1:06:06] first founded what was the Pentecostal
[1:06:08] Church first founded by Saint Paul in
[1:06:10] Ephesus the star of the Ephesian Church
[1:06:12] age scroll it up please
[1:06:14] second Church age of Smyrna virtue
[1:06:16] irenius all the way down next Church age
[1:06:18] was Perkins he talks about all of them
[1:06:19] what then come Philadelphia godliness
[1:06:21] Wesley Holiness just shall live by faith
[1:06:24] then come in brotherly kindness here you
[1:06:26] are seven Church ages seven steps God
[1:06:29] building his church is like one person
[1:06:31] into an individual into itself the glory
[1:06:35] the power of God coming down through
[1:06:37] this right here coming down through this
[1:06:41] because remember look this if you pull
[1:06:44] it straight down to here it won't fit
[1:06:47] right everybody got that or can you see
[1:06:50] it will not fit
[1:06:55] he's drawing right Paul
[1:07:01] that's where you pulls come from your
[1:07:02] third pull it's not a third push
[1:07:06] you ever tried to push a rope okay
[1:07:10] you can't control that sucker but you
[1:07:13] can pull it wherever you want to so it's
[1:07:15] a pull it's the pull of God the glory
[1:07:17] the power of God coming down through
[1:07:19] this What welding it together
[1:07:22] therefore the Pentecostal people that
[1:07:24] let out Duluth the Westland and things
[1:07:26] doesn't know what they're talking about
[1:07:27] you see they lived in this part of the
[1:07:29] temple right right that's the way some
[1:07:31] people can come up that high and drop
[1:07:33] off but look but look there's a genuine
[1:07:37] part of that right
[1:07:38] keeps making that building come on I
[1:07:41] will restore saith the Lord and that's
[1:07:44] what he's doing now then he's talking
[1:07:45] about the the Bright Tree let me read
[1:07:46] this real quick
[1:07:50] they raise up another denomination but
[1:07:52] the heart of the tree kept growing and
[1:07:53] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:07:54] and that's where we're at right that
[1:07:56] swing come Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus
[1:07:59] comes down and sets himself at the head
[1:08:01] of the church then and he will resurrect
[1:08:04] this church being his own body in there
[1:08:07] is the body
[1:08:09] in there right
[1:08:10] right and the way God is expecting us as
[1:08:13] an individual to
[1:08:16] grow the way he has brought his church
[1:08:19] in to grow every Church age it becomes
[1:08:22] one big church coming amen one big
[1:08:25] church common these fellows wasn't
[1:08:27] required what these fellas were this
[1:08:29] wasn't required they weren't required
[1:08:31] this in Luther's day
[1:08:33] they were not required for the full
[1:08:35] virtue to come then he talks about faith
[1:08:38] virtue coming up and all this different
[1:08:39] places Godless brother kindness and
[1:08:40] brotherly kindness and then the love of
[1:08:42] God the Holy Ghost Christ and the person
[1:08:44] of the Holy Ghost comes upon you now
[1:08:48] this is an anointing God's already in
[1:08:50] you
[1:08:50] this is an anointing all right it's an
[1:08:53] anointing the same anointing that came
[1:08:54] on Jesus right amen amen amen amen
[1:08:59] and then it lifted off of him at the
[1:09:01] Garden of Gethsemane what brother Brown
[1:09:02] said that's what's coming back in the
[1:09:04] end time
[1:09:05] amen that's the son of man Ministry
[1:09:07] listen we'll talk about this afternoon
[1:09:09] this is the Son of God message
[1:09:12] seven Church ages got the Son of God God
[1:09:15] in you Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:09:19] this is another anointing
[1:09:23] because that anointing came off Jesus
[1:09:25] and he could die if that anointing ever
[1:09:27] comes back on the bride
[1:09:30] she can't die right
[1:09:33] and you get all these virtues sealed in
[1:09:35] you then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:09:38] called the building the living
[1:09:39] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[1:09:41] Place when a man possesses these kind of
[1:09:44] things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:09:46] him
[1:09:48] right it's already in you right you just
[1:09:50] get another anointing no matter you
[1:09:52] might speak with tongues you might
[1:09:53] impersonate any gift that God's Got You
[1:09:55] might do that but until these virtues
[1:09:57] here go into you the virtues go in then
[1:10:01] the anointing comes on but when these
[1:10:03] virtues grow in and you added that to
[1:10:05] that then you are a living Monument you
[1:10:07] are a living moving Idol let's stand
[1:10:11] and we'll get we'll go back into that
[1:10:16] this afternoon if that's okay Lord
[1:10:18] willing
[1:10:19] but that's what that Holy Ghost is for
[1:10:21] right there it's to seal all this in is
[1:10:24] to put that same anointing on you
[1:10:26] that Jesus Christ had the three and a
[1:10:29] half year message the son of man
[1:10:31] Ministry

[1:10:36] ministry right right they had the Son of
[1:10:38] God Ministry
[1:10:39] which was what the Holy Ghost in you
[1:10:42] sure absolutely but not working the way
