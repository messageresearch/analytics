[25:12] week I believe she started going low you
[25:15] know from there and um you know she
[25:18] became worse and worse and worse but um
[25:22] uh before she passed away one week
[25:24] before she was so gentle and so kind not
[25:28] not one word she spoke to anybody you
[25:30] know U you know no she was not angry
[25:33] with anything she was just sweet and
[25:36] tender and kind and she kept praying to
[25:39] the Lord and she did lot of things you
[25:41] know when we when we looked how the Lord
[25:44] took her away you know she called my
[25:47] wife and she said Hereafter you are the
[25:50] one who take care of this ministry and I
[25:52] put you know you need to take
[25:54] responsibility on your shoulders and you
[25:57] need to be courageous and she called

[26:33] and you know I could do I did what I
[26:36] could do to help her but um on the
[26:39] second 22nd of March uh she went to be
[26:42] with the Lord and uh you know being
[26:44] beside her for so long and seen her
[26:46] suffering through all those days you
[26:49] know it really took uh toll on my mind
[26:52] and my body you know and U you know I

[29:43] mom mom and when I said uh mom mom she
[29:47] said you know he said Son you should not

[29:52] worrying about me and she told me that
[29:56] uh you wouldn't imagine how happy I am

[30:02] when she told me that she was very happy
[30:05] there brother that took my burden away
[30:09] brother that made me so happy I'm so
[30:12] relaxed and since then I started you
[30:14] know that helped me in two ways one way
[30:17] I forgot the sorrow I forgot the the
[30:20] pain I was going through because I was
[30:22] missing her badly H she was my great
[30:25] mother and uh the other other help I got
[30:28] was you know it made me to walk more
[30:30] closer to God because I want to go there
[30:34] I want to be there and meet my loved
[30:37] ones not only that I want to see the
[30:39] prophet of God I want to see all the
[30:42] children of the Lord I want to see the
[30:44] old you know Old Testament Saints and
[30:47] and live through eternity and that has
[30:50] really blessed me my brothers and my

[30:59] cried when I was speaking to brother
[31:01] Lloyd walls you know how she was
[31:03] suffering and you know he asked me
[31:05] certain things and I began and and I I
[31:07] cried a little bit but you know after
[31:09] that that dream I saw I stopped worrying
[31:13] because I know she's in a better place
[31:17] and and uh she's in a in a best
[31:20] condition she you know she is in she
[31:22] ever could be you know and I believe
[31:25] she's better than me you know you know
[31:27] and and I was just talking to brother
[31:29] Lloyd and he was telling me that he was
[31:31] listening to a mess and and said brother
[31:33] Brandon was trying to explain you know
[31:36] uh about the things beyond the curtain
[31:38] of time and the way he said things and
[31:40] the way he began to express those things
[31:43] you know it felt it seems like you know
[31:46] brother brother Brandon wanted to go to
[31:48] that place and when I was listening to
[31:50] brother Lord I said brother Lord you
[31:52] know what even I feel it is better to
[31:55] leave this world as soon as possible and
[31:57] get to that place brother that place is
[32:00] so good and so wonderful and and I just
[32:03] listened to the to the message beyond
[32:05] the curtain of time and how you know
[32:07] there is no sorrow and there's no no
[32:10] pain in the body and you know all all of
[32:14] you know whatever we lost you know
[32:16] brother Brandon says everything that's
[32:18] deformed will be straightened so
[32:20] everything will be perfect everything
[32:23] every circumstances will be a perfect
[32:25] one there so what a time that would be
[32:27] you know and I'm looking forward for
[32:29] that yes so you know I'm I'm really
[32:32] happy to be with you Saints this morning
[32:34] and I would like to just if you want a
[32:36] title I would like to uh you know uh say
[32:41] it like this what are you looking at I
[32:43] want to base myself on verse 10 uh where
[32:47] lot he lifted up his eyes and he began
[32:51] to to see the the plain of Jordan and
[32:55] that it was well watered everywhere
[32:58] before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[33:00] gomorra even as the garden of the Lord
[33:02] like the land of Egypt as thou comest
[33:05] into Z and we see that was a beautiful
[33:08] place and and the scripture says it was
[33:10] like just like Garden of Aiden and and
[33:13] and it was compared like the like the
[33:15] land of Egypt it was such a beautiful
[33:17] place and and and Lord began to to look
[33:21] at that place and uh you know the story
[33:24] very well that uh when God came to
[33:26] Abraham and he said abrah you know you
[33:28] leave your father's house and you leave
[33:30] your kindreds and he said you go to a
[33:32] place where I'm going to take him and
[33:34] and and Abraham he took his father with
[33:37] him yeah we know brother brandham made a
[33:40] statement about his dad he said he was
[33:42] like a dead fly in the ointment and then
[33:45] you know after some time he he died and
[33:48] and Abraham buried him but Lo his
[33:51] brother's son was with him traveling
[33:54] with him and as the days and months you
[33:56] know as this journey begin to progress
[33:59] you know the Lord begin to bless these
[34:01] people you know I believe whatever the
[34:03] people when they walk with God and when
[34:05] they are in the perfect will of God and
[34:07] when they obey God's word I believe
[34:10] certainly God will bless them in all the
[34:12] ways and and you can we can read in the
[34:14] Bible they were blessed you know with
[34:16] all material things uh that's in the
[34:19] world and and they had gold silver you
[34:22] know livestock and you know uh people uh
[34:26] their servants and M and and the people
[34:28] begin to multiply and Their Blessings
[34:30] begin to multiply and you know there
[34:33] came a time you know Lord's uh her men
[34:36] and and Abraham's Herman had a problem
[34:38] and an argument or a misunderstanding
[34:41] you know it happens when when things
[34:43] begin to grow when God begin to bless
[34:45] people you know automatically people
[34:47] they they change you know their attitude
[34:49] and their mindset and the thinking and
[34:52] everything changes because you know they
[34:53] have been blessed so much it happens in
[34:55] our natural life also you know when we
[34:58] when we are in troubles and when we are
[34:59] in difficulties we see that you know we
[35:01] walk more closer to God but you know
[35:04] once God start blessing us you know we
[35:06] try to slowly lay down you know our
[35:08] prayer life and you know go back a
[35:10] little bit and go away a little bit from
[35:13] the church and you know we try to miss
[35:14] one one time and you know this month and
[35:17] the next month you know we try to miss
[35:20] you know two times you know things like
[35:22] that and we keep on you know laying off
[35:24] and laying off and you know that's how
[35:26] we go far away from the Lord
[35:28] but brother sister you know these people
[35:30] were so much blessed and and because of
[35:32] this uh uh Strife between the Herman of
[35:35] lot and and Abraham and when Abraham
[35:38] came to know about this you know he came
[35:40] to lot and he said lot you know we are
[35:42] Brethren then let there be no Strife
[35:45] between us and you know Abraham's heart
[35:48] was such a he was such a wonderful
[35:50] person you know we all know the story he
[35:52] said you know what if you go towards the
[35:54] left side he said I will take the right
[35:56] side yeah I will go towards the right
[35:58] hand side but if you go to the right
[36:00] hand side he said I will go to the left
[36:02] hand side but brother sister you know
[36:04] and lo uh had a first choice right you
[36:08] know Lord has the first choice and I I
[36:10] believe uh every Christian's attitude
[36:13] should be like this my brother is much
[36:15] better than me you know he's my brother
[36:18] my sister is is better than me you know
[36:21] if we can have this kind of attitude
[36:23] brother we can overcome many problems
[36:26] but you know when we want to become
[36:28] something when we want to become number
[36:30] one brother that's the problem and I
[36:32] could see here Lord wanted to become
[36:34] number one Lord's heard men was be they
[36:37] wanted to become top people Top Class
[36:39] people and that's where the problem
[36:41] started between the two groups but you
[36:43] know here comes the man of God the
[36:45] prophet of God and he said you know what
[36:47] let's not have strive he said we are
[36:49] brethren we are children of God we are
[36:51] serving a living God and you know we
[36:54] cannot fight we cannot have fussing we
[36:56] cannot have this misunder standing
[36:58] between us many times brother sister you
[37:00] know I I wonder you know uh I believe
[37:03] just yesterday Brother Sam and Mel we
[37:06] were talking in his in his living room
[37:08] and he said you know I don't understand
[37:09] he said brother Samuel Dale he said you
[37:11] know we got one one message and we got
[37:14] you know one Bible and one God and you
[37:16] know we got so many doctrinal issues and
[37:18] you know one church is not happy with
[37:20] the other and they doesn't want to
[37:22] fellowship with each other one preacher
[37:24] is against the other one and the one is
[37:26] against the other one and you know all
[37:28] kinds of things are happening but
[37:30] brother sister we preach and we talk
[37:32] about great mysteries of God you know we
[37:34] talk about this message is such a you
[37:36] know you know big uh uh you know in a
[37:38] greater measure he said but you know the
[37:40] theme of the message is Brotherly
[37:44] Love where that love has gone what has
[37:48] happened to the love the love of God
[37:51] what has happened to that you know this
[37:53] message is all about the love agape love
[37:56] of God GL this is unconditional love I
[38:00] would like to tell you something this
[38:02] morning even even though I'm a wicked
[38:04] man even though I am a you know I I'm
[38:07] not a good man or or anything you want
[38:09] to say about me but you know you need to
[38:11] still love
[38:13] me because if you love your soul and you
[38:16] want to go in the
[38:19] Rapture let
[38:21] not that jealousy or anger or Grudge
[38:27] right let it not come into our hearts no
[38:31] matter what somebody's doing against us
[38:34] just put them into the Lord's hand and
[38:36] the Lord will take care of him that's
[38:38] what I believe the Bible says love your
[38:42] enemy and I believe my brothers my
[38:44] sister Abraham was trying to project
[38:47] himself in a proper manner and he showed
[38:51] that he was a true Son of God he showed
[38:54] himself that he was a you know real man
[38:56] of God and you know and and when he made
[38:59] that statement and and lot and his wife
[39:02] you know they thought this is a golden
[39:04] opportunity to get rid of this old
[39:10] man Lord's wife wife might have told him
[39:13] he said he said Lord Lord listen to me
[39:16] he said you know I'm anyhow tired with
[39:18] this with this old man I'm tired about
[39:21] his preaching I'm tired about his prayer
[39:23] meetings I'm tired about his Holiness
[39:26] I'm tired about this I'm tired about
[39:28] going to church I'm tired about to hear
[39:32] him he's become so
[39:35] old he's got so many
[39:40] reputations he's been repeating things
[39:43] always and I'm tired and and I'm fed off
[39:46] with
[39:48] him it's said this a good chance you
[39:51] know what I can see that place Green
[39:55] Well watered what do you think think
[39:57] about that Lord and Lord said you know
[40:00] what that must be a good
[40:04] idea husband and wife they both are
[40:07] one if they are Christians they both are
[40:09] one if they are non-christians they both
[40:12] are one because they got married to each
[40:15] other and the Bible says they both are
[40:17] one and Lord and Lord said you know that
[40:20] must be a very good idea said we got two
[40:23] daughters you know and we must think
[40:25] about the future you know can you
[40:28] imagine traveling this uh with this old
[40:30] man Abraham you know you know all
[40:33] through the deserts and Wilderness and
[40:36] you know he doesn't go through the
[40:37] cities you know he is like a Countryman
[40:40] and he's like a like an you know she
[40:43] said I don't know what to say I'm so fed
[40:46] off with him it's better to leave him
[40:48] alone and take our journey and they made
[40:51] a plan they decided they came to an
[40:54] agreement the Bible said you know two
[40:57] people cannot walk together unless they
[40:59] be agreed so lot and his wife they
[41:02] agreed together and they took decision
[41:04] you know uh collective decision and they
[41:06] said let's go to the the Green Plains he
[41:09] said that place looks much better than
[41:11] this it's all stones and you know dry
[41:14] and it's hard it's tough on life it's
[41:17] better we go and build a nice house you
[41:19] know and get better class of
[41:23] people let us go to the best Church
[41:25] there
[41:29] brother Brandon makes a statement in the
[41:31] message the faith of Abraham you know uh
[41:34] he preached it in 1959 he said that's
[41:36] the way many did like L did he said
[41:41] there's many that did like L did just a
[41:43] few more dollars he said when he was
[41:45] looking at the well water well water
[41:50] planes he didn't see his wife turning to
[41:54] a pillar of salt he didn't see it he
[41:57] said he said he didn't see the fire that
[42:01] was going to destroy the city and and
[42:05] part of his children he didn't see the
[42:07] disgrace that his daughters were going
[42:09] to do because raising them up in a bunch
[42:13] of worldliness like they were raised in
[42:16] Lo didn't see the after effect of going
[42:21] to Sodom and gomorra it is very
[42:24] important for us Christians today when
[42:26] you look at something you need to see
[42:30] the proper you know the positive thing
[42:32] of it brother it's very dangerous when
[42:36] you look at something and you really
[42:38] cannot see the aftermath after effects
[42:42] of that issue right now when Lord began
[42:46] to see towards Sodom and Gomorrah it was
[42:48] well watered plane in Jord he said it
[42:52] was a beautiful land it was a fruitful
[42:54] land but you know he didn't see the
[42:57] Propet of God said he didn't see that
[42:59] his wife was to become a pillar of
[43:02] salt that very place that he chose to go
[43:06] will become a curse to him one day the
[43:08] Bible says the men of Sodom Sodom were
[43:12] wicked men they were evil men right y
[43:16] but he only saw the the goodness the
[43:19] green part of it he didn't see the
[43:22] wickedness in Sodom and gomorra he
[43:25] didn't see the the sins of of Sodom and
[43:28] Gomorrah he didn't see the the the evil
[43:31] that was existing in Sodom and
[43:33] gomorah many times we do things many
[43:37] times we we try to you know uh do
[43:40] something and we don't see properly what
[43:43] is going to bring it to us what will be
[43:46] the effect of that thing what we are
[43:48] doing in our lives you know brother Bram
[43:51] makes a statement he said you know
[43:53] that's what you know you look at today
[43:55] friends it depends on what you're
[43:57] looking at it depends what you're
[44:00] looking at and it depends how you're
[44:02] looking at I see a young man sitting

[44:55] even have computers your smart phone is
[44:57] a smart thing you can ever have and it
[45:01] can make you so smart and brother Bram
[45:03] says when you become smart that will
[45:06] take you away from
[45:08] God the prophet of God also said he said
[45:12] you know what you just get down on the
[45:14] ground of the devil one time and just
[45:17] watch him what he's what he does that's
[45:20] right he said you just step in and you
[45:23] will see what he does you just watch him
[45:25] what he can do you know you don't have
[45:28] you don't have to step you don't have to
[45:30] you know give trouble to your body you
[45:32] can just sit down where you are and just
[45:34] one click right you're there right and
[45:38] you just
[45:40] watch that
[45:43] devil I don't believe we need you need
[45:46] to block you need to put a block
[45:48] something brother you need a block
[45:53] inside a person can put a block on the
[45:56] computer and a person can click it and
[45:59] take that block away but if you got that
[46:02] blocking thing in your heart I'm talking
[46:05] about that thing comes from Heaven that
[46:08] no man can give you no preacher can give
[46:10] you your dad and mom cannot give you
[46:13] your pastor cannot give you your
[46:15] visiting Minister cannot give you it is
[46:17] God who can give you that blocking
[46:20] thing and that's the Holy
[46:24] Ghost what we need today is the holy
[46:26] Holy Ghost
[46:30] friends thank you for agreeing with me
[46:35] amen there are many people they hardly
[46:38] speak about the Holy Ghost anymore yeah
[46:41] that's
[46:42] right but I believe if we need anything
[46:45] today it's the Holy Ghost more than
[46:49] anything that's in our life amen
[46:52] hallelujah we don't have jobs no problem
[46:54] you find it you'll get some job you
[46:57] don't have proper house to stay you

[47:05] have proper food no problem you eat
[47:07] whatever God gives you no proper
[47:09] clothing whatever God gives you wear it
[47:12] but let me tell you you cannot
[47:13] compromise with the Holy Ghost nothing
[47:16] can be
[47:18] substituted there is no substitute for
[47:20] the Holy Ghost we need it brothers and
[47:22] sisters and I believe God becomes
[47:26] obligated
[47:27] when we repent our sins when we come and
[47:30] set our life right in the presence of
[47:32] God and repent and God will give us the
[47:35] Holy Ghost that's what we need

[48:20] preach I would like to just obey the
[48:22] Holy Ghost this morning I just want to
[48:25] say what the Lord want me to
[48:28] Amen Brother Sam asked me this morning
[48:31] did you sleep well and even sister asked
[48:33] me I said I did Hallelujah but Frankly
[48:36] Speaking I li to them I got up at
[48:39] 1:23 a.m. this morning and I couldn't
[48:43] sleep after that I kept praying asking
[48:47] God I said Lord I don't know why I'm
[48:50] awake you know but Lord you help me
[48:54] right I need your guidance Lord I Need
[48:57] I want you to lead
[48:59] me because I'll be standing before your
[49:01] people and I don't know what's their
[49:04] need and what's the desires but you know
[49:06] it Lord so I give up give myself to you
[49:10] I know that I recognize I'm dust and Ash
[49:14] Lord I'm nothing but you can take the
[49:16] lump of clay and you can use it for your
[49:19] glory amen and I believe I'm yielding
[49:21] myself to the Holy Ghost this morning my
[49:23] brothers and my sisters
[49:27] it depends on what you're looking at
[49:30] right you cannot understand brother
[49:33] brandom or the Lord Jesus Christ by just
[49:36] reading the Bible or reading the message
[49:38] book it will take the power of the Holy
[49:41] Ghost it will take God to reveal himself
[49:44] to us than Lord so brother sister I will
[49:47] I will say like this when you look at
[49:49] the circumstances that is existing now
[49:52] in the present time you know you you see
[49:55] what is happening in the internet world
[49:57] you know it is an Internet that means it
[50:00] is a inside net once you get in you are
[50:03] not coming out unless God pulls you out
[50:07] of that net it's a terrible thing that
[50:10] we have in this world today brother you
[50:12] talk about that it's everywhere all over
[50:15] the world the devil has used his
[50:18] technology his wisdom all over the
[50:22] world exactly we had a revolution in
[50:26] India about the cell phones there is a
[50:29] family in India named by ambanis there
[50:32] are two brothers their father died their
[50:34] father's dream was to you know every
[50:36] person in India must have a mobile
[50:41] phone he passed the way but his sons
[50:44] have fulfilled that dream you get cell
[50:48] phones for nothing today yeah in
[50:53] India think about that
[50:57] and I'm not saying this because I have
[50:59] to say but I have seen many rack Pickers
[51:03] in
[51:05] dumpsters waiting there somebody called
[51:07] them and they're on the telephone yeah
[51:10] right in the dumpster yeah they have a
[51:13] phone
[51:16] yeah so we see this changing trend of
[51:19] the world today
[51:21] yeah so when you look at
[51:24] something the question is what you
[51:26] looking
[51:27] at just few minutes before I made a
[51:30] statement you cannot understand Jesus
[51:32] Christ or God Almighty but just reading
[51:34] the Bible or just reading the message
[51:35] you will never understand it will not
[51:38] take the intellectual power or knowledge
[51:40] to understand God it will take the
[51:42] revelation of God it will take the
[51:46] revealing of the word to our hearts and
[51:49] unless that
[51:51] happens and that's why we see all these
[51:54] things happening because they try to
[51:56] learn they try to educate themselves by
[52:00] a textbook brother bam says it cannot
[52:03] happen so it depends on what you're
[52:05] looking at right right when you look at
[52:08] something just like an example here
[52:11] brother Bram says Lord didn't see the
[52:15] after effects of going into Sodom and
[52:18] Gomorrah now it may look green it may
[52:21] look wonderful it may we may look at it
[52:25] just like a garden of hiden oh yeah
[52:28] right but when you step into that see
[52:31] the effect it's bring on your life
[52:35] right just see when you got on the
[52:38] ground of the devil and you watch him
[52:40] what he's trying to do track your eyes
[52:43] it track your mind it track your heart
[52:45] and brother you
[52:47] lost right and see the effect that's
[52:49] that's coming on your brain
[52:52] exactly people think it's it's a good
[52:54] thing you know to to play on a on a on a
[52:57] on a on a video game on computer you
[53:01] know they have two things and and
[53:02] children sit there and and they press
[53:05] buttons and and you know the press the
[53:06] more they press the more faster the car
[53:10] goes the race car go on the screen and
[53:12] you know when when they do you know they
[53:16] doesn't
[53:17] realize that screen that's that the car
[53:20] that is running fast so speed is
[53:23] affecting their minds right
[53:26] right we parents talk about people
[53:28] children becoming
[53:31] hyper well you don't doubt about it you
[53:34] have a video game in your in your
[53:36] computer at home and they're sitting
[53:38] always and sitting on the computer and
[53:40] trying to drive that car so
[53:48] speed that's what making them crazy
[53:52] right
[53:55] [Applause]
[53:59] when you look at something be careful
[54:02] what are you looking because that is
[54:04] going to affect your life
[54:07] right that affected Lord's life that
[54:11] affected Lord's wife's life that
[54:13] affected his two daughter's
[54:16] life see the disgrace they brought
[54:20] right Lord's wife become a pillar of
[54:23] salt
[54:24] right Lord he became the mayor of the
[54:27] town the city and he began to sit at the
[54:30] Gate of the city he be to look and you
[54:34] know you know try to help people in
[54:35] their family matters in their family
[54:37] issues he forgot his own family back at
[54:39] home the Bible says his righteous
[54:45] Soul his spiritual life was degrading
[54:48] now he's away from the pastor he's away
[54:51] from the from the church people he's
[54:53] away from prayer life he's away from the
[54:55] Christians right
[54:58] think about
[55:00] it brother Brenham
[55:03] says we look at the
[55:05] Unseen praise the lord we are looking at
[55:09] the Unseen things right the book of
[55:12] colation says the things which we see
[55:14] with our eyes are
[55:15] temporal the things which we don't see
[55:18] with our eyes are
[55:20] Eternal we Christian we children of God
[55:23] we are looking at the things unseen
[55:27] right brother brandham says in a message
[55:30] called God has a provided lamb speaking
[55:33] on the life of bermes and and trying to
[55:36] tell his story and the prophet of God
[55:38] says he said you know you know blindness
[55:41] is a horrible thing he says he said when
[55:44] I see a man blind my heart goes out for
[55:47] him but yet I know of a blindness that's
[55:51] worse spiritual blindness he said how
[55:55] God Made Me
[55:56] to visualize
[55:59] him and they can do it right
[56:06] amen God made
[56:09] man to visualize him to visual visualize
[56:13] means to form a picture of someone right
[56:18] to visualize means to see
[56:21] right God made
[56:24] man right when we were in the school
[56:27] they had a little saying God made man
[56:30] man made money ma money made man
[56:38] rich but God made us right so that we
[56:42] could see
[56:44] him that's right and the prophet of God
[56:47] said it is pity it is sorrowful that he
[56:51] cannot do
[56:54] it why because he has put his eyes on
[56:57] something else that's
[57:00] right but what you see with your eyes is
[57:02] All Temporary no matter how beautiful it
[57:05] is no matter how attracting it is no
[57:08] matter how it is affecting your your
[57:10] heart and making you Merry and
[57:13] happy just now I heard something you
[57:16] know recently that your country or some
[57:18] of the states have already made it legal
[57:20] to take
[57:21] marijuana oh they say it is better than
[57:24] better than smoking cigarettes
[57:28] when I came to when I came to you know
[57:31] uh my wife's aunt in New Jersey you know
[57:34] and and uh we were just talking at the
[57:36] at the time of breakfast and and she
[57:38] began to talk about you know uh taking
[57:41] drinks and and she began to make a
[57:43] statement and and she said you know you
[57:45] know it's nothing wrong to take a social
[57:47] drink
[57:50] sometimes and you know his son her son
[57:52] and and another her brother's son and we
[57:55] both were both were traveling and and
[57:57] they said he said what do you think
[57:58] brother Sam about taking social drink I
[58:01] said Brothers if you steal a dime or a
[58:05] $100 bill or
[58:08] $1,000 he
[58:10] stealing exactly exactly right whether
[58:14] you steal a dime or a nickel whether you
[58:17] steal a dollar or $10 or $1,000 is still
[58:21] a robbery it's
[58:23] stealing whether it is a social or a
[58:25] nonsocial
[58:34] right right
[58:39] amen thank you
[58:44] sister people
[58:47] are I don't know what to
[58:51] say soal
[58:54] yeah and we we are so-called Christians
[58:59] oh so-called Christian
[59:04] country I'm sorry to make this statement
[59:06] but I'm sorry it is so much hypocrisy
[59:09] that's
[59:12] right thank you brother word thank
[59:16] you it is so much hypocrisy right yes
[59:20] sir
[59:21] brother I've seen that in the message
[59:24] ranks too
[59:26] right I'm sorry to say this
[59:29] exactly but the truth is truth
[59:34] always we were made to see
[59:38] God we are not made to see the glamour
[59:41] of this world or what the devil has to
[59:44] give it to us we have divorced
[59:48] him he was our first Kinsmen but we have
[59:50] given a
[59:51] divorcement we have left him we got
[59:55] nothing to do
[59:57] when a when a man and a woman are
[1:00:00] divorced the law says the country the
[1:00:03] law of your country says he said the man
[1:00:07] should not come in the place where the
[1:00:10] his ex-wife is yeah he should not come
[1:00:14] in our vicinity or she should not come
[1:00:16] in our
[1:00:18] vicinity if you all agree with that law
[1:00:21] in this country
[1:00:26] and if you say Amen to that law how much
[1:00:30] more we could say Amen right because we
[1:00:33] divorced our first as husband brother
[1:00:36] you cannot go where he is and he cannot
[1:00:38] come where you are if you agree say Amen
[1:00:41] to that because we got nothing to do
[1:00:44] with
[1:00:45] him we are not interested what he wants
[1:00:48] to give it to us we are interested in
[1:00:50] God and the things of God and and we
[1:00:53] want to only be you know interested in
[1:00:55] his things am that's right that's what
[1:00:58] we are made for that's amen and it is it
[1:01:01] is so bad it is so pitiful that a man
[1:01:04] who is made to visualize God and he
[1:01:08] cannot do it right yeah so you know
[1:01:10] brother Bram goes further he says Lord
[1:01:12] Journeys himself and take down to
[1:01:14] Hollywood or some big place you know a
[1:01:18] bigger Church where there are little
[1:01:20] more classical people you know just a
[1:01:23] little little better educated preachers
[1:01:25] and so forth he said oh he felt he had
[1:01:28] be all right he had just gone down there
[1:01:32] he felt he was all right if you go
[1:01:34] there that's what the problem there's no
[1:01:37] there's no problem it doesn't matter you
[1:01:40] know to have a social drink it doesn't
[1:01:42] matter to speak one little lie it
[1:01:44] doesn't matter to do to steal you know a
[1:01:46] little bit it doesn't matter to to to
[1:01:49] give false witness it doesn't matter it
[1:01:51] doesn't matter to do this and do that
[1:01:53] and brother once you get in you're
[1:01:55] finished yeah right you will never
[1:01:58] realize that's what happened in the in
[1:02:00] the in the life of Job and he said he
[1:02:02] was on his road backsliding right then
[1:02:05] he said get away from Divine Healing and
[1:02:07] the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:02:09] there's no better class than Jesus
[1:02:11] Christ there's no better person there's
[1:02:14] no better god brother I come from a
[1:02:17] country they got 33 millions in gods and
[1:02:21] goddesses but I can tell you I have
[1:02:23] found one amen right there nothing can
[1:02:26] match
[1:02:27] him nothing can come equal to him he's
[1:02:31] our Lord Jesus Christ my brothers my
[1:02:34] sisters he said he was already on a road
[1:02:37] to backslide you know in the message
[1:02:38] called Abraham brother randam speaks he
[1:02:40] said Lo already was already backsliding
[1:02:43] in his heart and he went to towards
[1:02:46] Sodom if he went to Sodom if he chose
[1:02:49] Sodom it was not that he was backslid
[1:02:52] after he went to Sodom but he was
[1:02:54] already backslid
[1:02:56] that's why he chose
[1:03:01] s he was already black backs
[1:03:06] sladen and then you know what the hand
[1:03:09] of him but Abraham as soon as he had
[1:03:12] done what God told him to do to separate
[1:03:14] himself from his Kindred and everything
[1:03:16] he said what about Sarah here him and
[1:03:19] Sarah's W you and your wife are one amen
[1:03:22] because she's in Covenant with him
[1:03:25] because is his wife but notice when he
[1:03:28] separated himself from lot and Lot's
[1:03:30] wife I imagine Mrs lot wanted to belong
[1:03:34] to all the lotteries and everything
[1:03:36] going along through the country you know
[1:03:38] she was a hindrance to him the Bible
[1:03:42] says let us lay aside every weight and
[1:03:44] sin that easily beset us when we are in
[1:03:48] this kind of a journey let's run this
[1:03:52] race with patience that set before us us
[1:03:56] looking unto the author and the finisher
[1:03:59] of our faith our eyes must be put on
[1:04:03] Jesus Christ which is the author and the
[1:04:06] finisher of our faith praise the Lord
[1:04:10] just think about that prodigal son this
[1:04:13] morning he took all his father's money
[1:04:16] his inheritance and he said I will go
[1:04:19] I'm grown up I know what is right and
[1:04:21] what is wrong so let me go and let me
[1:04:24] live my life so dad said okay son have
[1:04:27] your own way and he went he went to a
[1:04:30] far away country when he went he didn't
[1:04:34] see what he was looking for actually he
[1:04:38] was looking for a
[1:04:40] trouble and the prophet of God says he
[1:04:43] said you know his money was all spent
[1:04:45] his friends left him then he went to a
[1:04:49] citizen there and he said sir I have
[1:04:52] lost all my money he said I was in a
[1:04:55] very good position one time but today
[1:04:58] I'm with nothing I have no friends I
[1:05:00] need a job can you help me and that man
[1:05:03] he said you know what I will give you
[1:05:06] two
[1:05:07] buckets and you can go to the pig pan
[1:05:11] and brother Bram speaks about he used a
[1:05:13] word he said he joined with a citizen
[1:05:14] and he gave him two slob buckets to go
[1:05:18] slob the Haw and the prophet of God said
[1:05:22] think about a
[1:05:24] Hebrew being in the pig
[1:05:28] pen he was raised in a Hebrew family he
[1:05:32] was raised to live a holy life he was
[1:05:34] raised to be a spiritual person he was
[1:05:37] raised to be a person who will love the
[1:05:40] Lord he was raised to follow the
[1:05:42] Commandments of God but now he has left
[1:05:44] his father mother his family he has come
[1:05:47] to a far away country you know can you
[1:05:50] imagine he's in the pig
[1:05:54] pen what a place for a Hebrew to be in
[1:05:57] yeah
[1:05:58] right a terrible place a terrible
[1:06:03] situation he said as soon as you get
[1:06:06] from under the influence of the Holy
[1:06:08] Spirit he said that's what happened to
[1:06:12] you we cannot get away from the
[1:06:15] influence of the Holy Ghost right amen
[1:06:18] that's why we need Holy Ghost every
[1:06:20] second of our
[1:06:22] Liv it's not just seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:06:24] when we come to Church of for the prayer
[1:06:26] meeting we need Holy Ghost every day we
[1:06:30] need a refilling of fresh every day just
[1:06:33] like David says Lord my cup is filled
[1:06:35] and it is running over we need to be
[1:06:38] filled every day with a fresh you know
[1:06:41] spirit of God with a fresh blessing with
[1:06:44] a fresh as his compassion is new Every
[1:06:46] Morning towards us brother he can if you
[1:06:49] ask him Lord I need the Holy Ghost for
[1:06:51] today he will give it to you
[1:06:56] people are afraid to receive the Holy
[1:07:02] Ghost they're afraid they're even afraid
[1:07:04] to call Holy
[1:07:07] Ghost to make things easy they will say
[1:07:09] holy
[1:07:17] spirit sometimes we people have good
[1:07:19] spirit but it's not the Holy
[1:07:23] Ghost exactly have a good spirit is not
[1:07:25] a holy
[1:07:27] spirit sometimes we people have good
[1:07:29] spirit you
[1:07:31] know everything looks good and good
[1:07:33] spirit you know we are in High Spirits
[1:07:35] sometime but that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:07:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] is is word made flesh that's
[1:07:43] right the Holy Ghost is God himself
[1:07:46] right the Holy Ghost is God himself
[1:07:48] living in the people praise the Lord
[1:07:51] hallelujah I want you to look at Joshua
[1:07:53] and calib when those
[1:07:56] they went to you know look into that
[1:07:58] land to spy that place and Joshua and
[1:08:01] calb they had you know the evidence from
[1:08:04] that land praise the Lord but there were
[1:08:07] 10 others the problem with you know this
[1:08:10] kind of issues the majority is all
[1:08:14] negatives only two came with a positive
[1:08:17] report and brother sister Joshua and
[1:08:20] calb said you know what you know this is
[1:08:22] the evidence of the land and he said we
[1:08:24] are more than able we can make it but
[1:08:27] the other 10 said you know what don't
[1:08:29] listen to their
[1:08:30] report something is wrong with their
[1:08:32] minds said man when we stepped into that
[1:08:35] land we saw giants there we saw sons of
[1:08:39] anoch and we saw seven kinds of
[1:08:41] different you know uh races of people
[1:08:44] there man they're terrible and when we
[1:08:46] looked at ourselves we look like a grass
[1:08:48] opers in our side and in their side man
[1:08:51] they will just put our feet and we are
[1:08:53] finished we are smashed he said don't
[1:08:56] hear to their report their report is
[1:08:58] wrong he said that's not correct come on
[1:09:02] and it's more easy to listen to a false
[1:09:06] report than to listen to the truth it's
[1:09:10] very hard to listen to the truth right
[1:09:13] amen the the false has got such a
[1:09:16] mesmerizing
[1:09:18] power you just go and put William
[1:09:22] brandom and see what pops up first
[1:09:28] yeah and when people click that and get
[1:09:31] into it all negatives all negatives all
[1:09:33] wrong reports
[1:09:36] yeah think about that come
[1:09:39] on my precious brothers and
[1:09:43] sisters he said don't you hear their
[1:09:45] report that's something
[1:09:48] wrong this court was wrong this court
[1:09:51] was wrong that is wrong with the cloud
[1:09:53] that is wrong with this even was not
[1:09:55] there at that day he he did this and he
[1:09:58] shouldn't have done this he shouldn't
[1:10:00] have that way or this
[1:10:06] way what you're looking at it depends on
[1:10:09] what you're
[1:10:11] looking that's right it will take the
[1:10:14] Holy Ghost to reveal that's right
[1:10:16] himself to
[1:10:17] you amen we cannot just read the
[1:10:20] messages we cannot just read the Bible
[1:10:22] and put the knowledge what we have read
[1:10:25] into our data in our brains and act like
[1:10:27] a Christian brother what you are inside
[1:10:30] it will show up one day and that's what
[1:10:33] has happened it has showed up it it
[1:10:36] needs a time for a perfect timing when
[1:10:40] that timing comes it will
[1:10:42] chop it will chop whether you are a true

[1:14:44] bluffer right like the other one the
[1:14:46] Devil he's not a cheat he's not a devil
[1:14:49] he's not a liar he's not a deceiver he
[1:14:52] said I would tell
[1:14:54] you if there were no nothing like that I
[1:14:56] would have told you come on but he said
[1:14:59] in my father's house there are many
[1:15:00] manions he said I go to prepare a place
[1:15:04] he said I will come and take you brother

[1:15:10] another 30 years 20 years no matter how
[1:15:13] long brother we need to wait patiently
[1:15:16] because we know the promise is true amen
[1:15:19] and the one who made the promise is
[1:15:22] able that's it and the Bible says you
[1:15:26] are healed by the strives he had on
[1:15:28] Calvary you take that
[1:15:31] word and exercise your faith on that
[1:15:34] word I'm Healed in the name of the Lord
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ I'm Healed in the name of
[1:15:39] the Lord Jesus Christ and you claim that
[1:15:42] healing no matter today you have
[1:15:44] symptoms keep claiming it keep thanking
[1:15:47] God tomorrow you have same symptoms just
[1:15:50] don't look at symptoms just keep
[1:15:52] thanking God if this week just keep
[1:15:55] thanking God yes sir exactly that's what
[1:15:58] we need to do a true attitude of a child
[1:16:02] of God be positive amen Abraham was
[1:16:06] positive for how long 25
[1:16:10] years
[1:16:12] sir and the Bible says he never
[1:16:14] staggered at the promise of
[1:16:16] God it's very important brother sister
[1:16:19] what you're looking at today yes it's
[1:16:23] very important
[1:16:29] the prophet of God he says but this
[1:16:31] little mortal perverted thing that you
[1:16:34] live is called life you can take that
[1:16:37] when so desired but to show that that
[1:16:41] isn't life how miserable it becomes he
[1:16:45] said this what we call life now is only
[1:16:48] a shadow or a negative right that's
[1:16:51] right the life we living today which we
[1:16:53] call this is a perverted life brother
[1:16:56] brandom says and he says the life which
[1:16:58] we living is a shadow or a
[1:17:01] negative to make a positive it will take
[1:17:04] death brother brandham said right and he
[1:17:06] said we all like to
[1:17:08] Rejoice but we can Rejoice over right
[1:17:11] thing that shows that we are hooked up
[1:17:14] with a real thing when we Rejoice over
[1:17:17] the right thing but when we Rejoice over
[1:17:19] the wrong thing it shows we are hooked
[1:17:21] up with the wrong thing so our life can
[1:17:24] tell right now what we are which way our
[1:17:28] emotions are running do you see that
[1:17:30] right are you with me brothers and
[1:17:32] sisters he said if we are rejoicing over
[1:17:34] the world and the evil things our minds
[1:17:37] and our souls are inspired by below
[1:17:41] right and he speaks about Boogie Woogie
[1:17:43] dances heartaches drinking all of the
[1:17:46] things that we run after it's from below
[1:17:48] but he said but if you rejoice in the
[1:17:51] spirit amen if you're happy to come to
[1:17:54] church yeah when somebody tells you he
[1:17:57] said let's go for a prayer meeting
[1:17:59] praise the Lord Brother let's go when
[1:18:01] you rejoice in that when you rejoice to
[1:18:04] be in the company of godly people he
[1:18:07] said when you rejoice in the spirit that
[1:18:09] we have eternal life and we raise our
[1:18:11] emotions to God and praise him then we
[1:18:14] have joy am he said but not full of
[1:18:17] perverted life but full of eternal life
[1:18:20] that comes from above he said so you you
[1:18:22] can see it depends on what you to look
[1:18:25] at
[1:18:27] glory I pray that God will help us today
[1:18:30] to look at the right thing to look at
[1:18:34] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:18:37] that's right amen praise the Lord our
[1:18:40] life will tell

[1:21:24] talking don't be Hasty in thinking stop
[1:21:28] and see what you're looking at right
[1:21:30] it's very important I like to just put a
[1:21:33] little story before you if you don't
[1:21:35] mind brother Brandon was called one day
[1:21:37] to pray for a little
[1:21:39] boy his dad and mom old people he said
[1:21:43] and he was called to the hospital when
[1:21:45] he went to the hospital you know the
[1:21:47] doctor caught him right at the door and
[1:21:49] he said uh you cannot go in to pray
[1:21:51] because that boy has got deia
[1:21:55] he said you are a father you are a
[1:21:57] married man and you will pack that you
[1:21:59] know deia and you will take it to your
[1:22:01] children and brother Brandon began to
[1:22:02] talk to him and he said no he said I
[1:22:05] want to go and lay my hands on that
[1:22:07] little boy he said no sir you cannot go
[1:22:09] and by the way he was talking brother
[1:22:11] brandham found out that he was a
[1:22:12] Catholic man and he asked him he said
[1:22:15] you know what if the Catholic priest
[1:22:16] comes to give him a last ride would you
[1:22:18] allow him he said you know that's that
[1:22:21] thing is different because Catholic
[1:22:22] priest is not married you are a married
[1:22:24] man you got children you cannot go in
[1:22:26] but brother brandham said he talked it
[1:22:28] over and you know finally they dressed
[1:22:30] him with a hoodie you know and they
[1:22:31] covered his whole body and he had to
[1:22:33] wash his hands and he had to put gloves
[1:22:35] and and all kinds of things and he said
[1:22:37] he couldn't hardly see where he was
[1:22:39] walking but you know they finally took
[1:22:40] him into the room and he saw father and
[1:22:43] mother beside the boys's you know s
[1:22:46] bedside and as soon as brother brandom
[1:22:48] went in he began to you know pray for
[1:22:50] that little lad and brother brandom says
[1:22:53] while he was praying there was no vision
[1:22:55] God never gave him any sign or he never
[1:22:57] spoke to him anything he just prayed he
[1:22:59] said Lord he's got a good home to be
[1:23:01] raised good Godly Christian father and
[1:23:03] mother why you want to take his life
[1:23:05] Lord have mercy on this little one and
[1:23:07] save him father and he finished and as
[1:23:09] soon as brother Bram finished his prayer
[1:23:11] you know the father mother begin to cry
[1:23:13] and the tears begin to roll upon their
[1:23:15] cheeks and you know they begin to you
[1:23:18] know hug each other and and and the
[1:23:20] husband and the father of the boys said
[1:23:21] you know it is all well now he said you
[1:23:24] know our son is all right and and he
[1:23:26] will be well he's healed you know and
[1:23:28] they begin to worship God and and thank
[1:23:30] him and there was a little nurse in that
[1:23:32] room and he said how you people can act
[1:23:34] funny like that and then they and she
[1:23:37] took them to the machine he said see
[1:23:39] when this line runs low like this he
[1:23:41] said in few hours this boy will be dead
[1:23:44] he said you cannot act like this you
[1:23:46] cannot say like this you cannot feel
[1:23:48] like this and that old man he put his
[1:23:51] hand around that little nurse and she
[1:23:53] said child
[1:23:56] you are looking at the machines there
[1:23:59] you only learn to to see those line and
[1:24:01] you know what that means but he said
[1:24:03] child I'm looking at the promise of
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:12] God I'm looking at the promise of God
[1:24:14] and they begin to father and mother they
[1:24:16] begin to thank God said Thank you Lord
[1:24:19] for healing my child and the prophet of
[1:24:21] God said that that boy was grown up
[1:24:23] married had children right exactly amen
[1:24:28] amen it depends on what you're looking
[1:24:30] at right amen now I would like to tell
[1:24:34] my own experience my mother passed away
[1:24:36] and I was kind discouraged depressed you
[1:24:38] know always crying when I whenever I was
[1:24:40] alone I was just crying like a baby I
[1:24:43] loved my mom amen and I was missing her
[1:24:48] and that is a great burden to you know
[1:24:50] hold upon my shoulder and my wife's
[1:24:52] shoulder and brother when that dream
[1:24:54] came to me all my burdens rolled away
[1:24:57] yes sir
[1:24:58] right it depends the way you look at
[1:25:01] things amen till August the 5th I was
[1:25:04] looking the death of my brother in a
[1:25:06] different way right I thought it was a
[1:25:09] loss I thought it was a grief even
[1:25:12] though I have studied the message I have
[1:25:14] preached brother Brenham says death for
[1:25:16] a Christian is not the end it's a
[1:25:19] beginning I have preached myself right
[1:25:23] but being in flesh losing Mom right
[1:25:27] that's true but I was looking at her
[1:25:29] death in a different way but fifth of
[1:25:32] August the Lord came and and he cleared
[1:25:35] the whole scenario right and now I look
[1:25:38] in other way thank you Lord and that
[1:25:41] does that doesn't make me feel
[1:25:44] sorrowful that makes me
[1:25:47] happy because she's in a better place
[1:25:55] it depends on on the way you look at
[1:25:58] things this may be very simple to you
[1:26:01] friends but this has really blessed
[1:26:03] me and this thing has really was on my
[1:26:07] heart at 1:23 a.m. this
[1:26:09] morning and I don't wanted to change it
[1:26:13] I got a big bunch of papers like this
[1:26:16] carrying with me wherever I'm traveling
[1:26:18] but you know it's not good to have so
[1:26:20] many messages in your in your bag if God
[1:26:23] is Not There
[1:26:27] I want him I want him on the scene and
[1:26:31] if it doesn't bless anybody here and one
[1:26:34] person that's
[1:26:37] it that's where I'm looking for I just
[1:26:41] recently preached a service in
[1:26:43] Smithville Tennessee and I felt that day
[1:26:45] I said oh my I'm a flop
[1:26:49] today the way people responded you know
[1:26:51] and the things I seen when I was
[1:26:53] preaching I said man I'm a plop it's
[1:26:56] utter failure
[1:26:58] today but you know the brother called
[1:27:00] for the prayer and there one man in the
[1:27:03] corner he got up and he came and he
[1:27:06] shook my hand he said you
[1:27:08] pray that God has spoken to me this
[1:27:10] night amen said I needed it God spoke to
[1:27:15] me said God touch my life Brother s will
[1:27:18] you pray for me and ask God's help and I
[1:27:21] pray with you I said we both pray
[1:27:23] together right
[1:27:25] that
[1:27:25] brother he began to pray and I began to
[1:27:29] pray I thank God later on I said Lord I
[1:27:32] thought I was a
[1:27:36] failure but you know God put Abraham
[1:27:38] before
[1:27:40] us no matter how you how you see things
[1:27:43] and circumstances no matter how you feel
[1:27:46] about things just be positive amen just
[1:27:49] keep believing God glory amen praise the
[1:27:52] Lord he stayed positive with God you
[1:27:54] know brother brandham says he said he
[1:27:56] says you know that's the way Abraham was
[1:27:58] doing he stayed right with the Positive
[1:28:01] no matter if people said say you know
[1:28:03] that old fellow so joining with us up
[1:28:05] here he's about half crazy his wife is
[1:28:08] old feeble woman so look how old he is
[1:28:11] and the gray whiskers and the hair
[1:28:13] hanging down to his waistline almost and
[1:28:16] then he says they are going to have a
[1:28:18] baby did you ever hear of anything such
[1:28:21] a kind have you ever heard this yeah he
[1:28:24] said he's off crazy oh
[1:28:27] yeah he was I believe he was crazy for
[1:28:31] his
[1:28:32] God he believed him so much he knew it
[1:28:36] would happen one
[1:28:38] day and no matter people call call us a
[1:28:41] cult today
[1:28:43] amen that's right it's it's it's so
[1:28:46] shocking to say people who preached this
[1:28:49] message called it a cult
[1:28:54] M I'm not a good internet man I'm an
[1:28:58] illiterate actually but this news I get
[1:29:01] from my young people in the
[1:29:05] church he said oh they called us a cult
[1:29:09] I said okay they called Jesus amen
[1:29:13] Belo they called him of the de he was of
[1:29:16] the devil they called him illegitimate
[1:29:18] child that that didn't affect him right
[1:29:20] so this thing will not affect us right
[1:29:23] amen praise the Lord because we got the
[1:29:26] evidence amen we have taken the sides of
[1:29:28] positive brother Bram says he said it
[1:29:31] depends on how much
[1:29:34] Statics you tune tune out yeah it's
[1:29:38] unbelief right he said how much unbelief
[1:29:41] you take out of your life how much you
[1:29:44] inject faith in you right brother Bram
[1:29:48] says I'm looking at Faith and that faith
[1:29:51] cannot be perished so what we looking at
[1:29:53] today today amen right at perishable
[1:29:56] world or the perishable things or the
[1:29:59] unish perishable Faith amen it depends
[1:30:03] on what you look at may God help us
[1:30:05] today to look you know the way God
[1:30:09] wanted us to love amen praise the Lord I
[1:30:12] got many things to say but I don't want
[1:30:14] to wear you out but I would like to let
[1:30:16] let you know a few things when Isaiah
[1:30:18] saw him he saw counselor Prince of Peace
[1:30:22] Mighty God Amen Everlasting father he
[1:30:25] saw him the Messiah amen when is when
[1:30:29] Daniel saw he said he saw us a stone
[1:30:33] that was heed out of the mountain
[1:30:34] without hands and crushed the Gentile
[1:30:36] Nations you know when Ezekiel Saw he
[1:30:39] said he saw a wheel in a wheel praise
[1:30:42] the Lord you know when Nebuchadnezzar
[1:30:44] saw he just thought that he was
[1:30:45] increasing the fire but he he saw the
[1:30:48] four man come down from heaven praise
[1:30:51] the Lord you know we need to just see
[1:30:54] how the how the prophets and the
[1:30:56] prophets of the old saw we need to see
[1:30:58] the way our prophets are amen you know
[1:31:02] Jesus when he was on this Earth he
[1:31:03] challenged those people they couldn't
[1:31:05] see him NE sorry Nicodemus couldn't see
[1:31:09] the new birth
[1:31:12] right everywhere he went and preached
[1:31:15] the same thing but some people

[1:31:26] think about me they said you are Elias
[1:31:28] or you know you're you're one of the
[1:31:30] prophets but Peter with the right
[1:31:32] Revelation he said no you are the son of
[1:31:35] a living God that's right the word
[1:31:37] Christ and he said on this rock I will
[1:31:40] build my church and I believe God is
[1:31:42] doing that today he's building his
[1:31:45] Church on the Rock called the
[1:31:48] Revelation think about that when you
[1:31:50] think about John the Baptist he was the
[1:31:52] only one that saw the Lamb of God right
[1:31:56] there were thousands of people around
[1:31:58] him he was the only one that saw the D
