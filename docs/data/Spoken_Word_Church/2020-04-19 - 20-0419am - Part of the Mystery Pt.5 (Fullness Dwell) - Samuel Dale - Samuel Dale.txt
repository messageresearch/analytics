fellowship with us so that's that's a good good point and we just have a good time in the Lord agree just pray one for another remember brother Bob will they minister in force he's coming Wednesday so keep that in mind and just keep praying for and brave I know you're doing it but just keep praying for brother Forney he seems to be doing better he's able to talk and and walk and do things so just

out all right I want to thank everybody for for the cards and gifts and the things for my birthday last Sunday you know and we just had a good time doing that and pray thank you for everything you know it's good to to have people coming together and and fellowship and on your birthday even if they have to be outside that's the odd hour that we're living that something that's the outside some people come inside and on that's just it just I've never seen nothing like it and I guess we never will but just keep praying pray for around the world for all of the people and everything and just plead blood of Jesus Christ for all of these people and all like that and just hold them up before the Lord you know now then strike incoming Lee in the message ranks just remember to provide the blood for them okay if you like turning in your scripture turn to mark 4 in Leviticus 23 we'll read mark 4 in Leviticus 23 I want to try to carry our thought on I'm trying to get to a position for us to think on some things and I'm hoping that what its dwelling in is what the Prophet said and he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here of what she's here for said she'd be an invincible army well alright we just keep believing who we are and keep accepting what the word says we are and I pray that the thought went across there I've mentioned it a couple of times you know Wade preached back yonder on earth you know he said we we talked about Abraham but said you know it's it's us they look back there and see yourself read yourself all the way through the Bible when you see Moses and what happened read yourself there and see what's happened and see what's taking place now and come right on out to the very hour that we're living in the word the Lord Jesus we thank you for this day and your grace and we pray that you would just bless us together in you and as we ask that you would be with each and every one they were the ones outside Lord that are listening in today and and being able to view the services and things thank you for them coming and taking their time Lord because they don't have to they could sit at home and do these but some choose to come in fellowship so we pray that you would just bless each one because it's it's a hard thing to not be able to go to church and and Lord that's hurting her our very beings of everything because we've always just been ready to go it wouldn't no thought about it it was just already gone we'd already dire we didn't care about anything else we ask you now to just have your way be with the sick ones among us we were brother our Lord and just touch him and remember the hounds sister Aldrin Lord never brother Dale it's just a Mary dougherty there Lord be with her brother Colley and just bless each and every one of all together in you in Jesus name Amen mark forward begin verse 26 and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that to full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us in the sickle because the harvest is coming ok we'll go to Leviticus to pick up her point and just go with this weights been covered knees so we just reviewed a lot of it but we're going to Leviticus 23:10 speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest there then you shall bring a of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the Marah I've through the Sabbath the priest shall wave it and ye shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf a lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now remember here in Leviticus we just mention it if you notice it's talking about the sheath wave and we'll get back to that but there's always a there's an offering that goes with that the you know there was an offerings and it was a lamb it was offering there's always in those type of things there is an offering to be made you know by the people in doing it so to me I think the greatest offering that you and I could make according to the Bible is presenting our bodies of living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the Lord which is our reasonable service alright so as we come to understanding about the sheath waves and the things and what happened back there in the natural we see and we don't forget that sacrifice it went with it our the offering that went with it you know and that's what we're to be an our day and to see the hour that we're living so we'll get back to those things kind of end to the message alright now we've recovered we covered last Sunday on the Easter time but the service before that we were covering we were talking about the son of man or the revealing of the Son of Man and I pray that this will help you and you know I want to keep reading some things because I want you to think about it alright now we we went through in the son of man and dealing with it you know that you got in in God you got the three that the son of man son of God son of David all right so then in the son of man is the Old Testament dealing of the prophets each one of those were son of man all right now they were not the son of man they were a son of man all right that the son of man was speaking through now I want you to do it and I'm gonna repeat this in a minute where you'll remember it remember the prophets all said thus saith the Lord all right which meant it wasn't them they were saying what something was telling them to say all right and bringing it down to personal to getting to the contact all right and they would say thus says the Lord but Jesus never said thus saith the Lord he was the Lord all right see now if you'll tie together and keep it in the correct order of understanding you'll follow the message out and see what you know what the Prophet is talking about that the Son of Man was the Old Testament the prophets all right that was the the father's dispensation as we call it you know God back there with those people speaking through the prophets because they chose that they remember to Moses they chose it they said we don't want God to speak no more so we want you to speak so he said okay from now it'll come through the Prophet the Prophet would bring the word alright not leaving out the father of the Old Testament because that would be the very father himself the Creator God and it's like I told you there on that last message I was preaching on this that isn't it amazing that in the Old Testament you have the Creator God the word alright that's who it was who was the creator the word created all things alright and the word is you know the son of man was the word himself because he come on over in the scriptures and him Gordon the prophet said who is this on a man he said in the beginning was the word word with garden the Word was God that's the son of man alright so then when you're dealing with the Old Testament you can look at it as son of man that's under the father the dispensation and you can see and go all the way back and I hope you followed the point that's making little little statements let's see then the word being the Creator who created over the world and mankind and the angels and thing the word who the Son of Man the Son of Man the word the Creator God well then you come over to the Gospels and you read how that the Son of Man is the sower of the seed well see if there's any creation it has to deal with son of man right son of man so I hope you put that into your log book and keep it with you to think about then you can watch the creation coming down through the Old Testament and coming out and the climax or thoughts of the Old Testament came forth into the creation of the Son of Man in human flesh the word John 1:14 the that was made flesh and dwelt among us and there stood all mighty God in human flesh the Son of man all right so he didn't have to speak thus saith the Lord he was the Lord and what he said was that part and if you're thinking it and keep it up maybe shouldn't mention it but if you'll keep your mind in the correct talk of looking at flesh and seeing that that cedar learn because to me it gets down to brother Branham see brother Branham come to the point because that's what I'm trying to get all of us to come to to see brother Branham come to the point to bring in the Son of Man and he spoke thus saith the Lord because it was the Lord giving the word to him to speak but then he says now it's not what I say you remember there in the scripture he says what you say alright see then if you'll take it I said real carefully so you can follow Moses down to actually Moses wound up speaking the very words of God riding the Bible rain in all of those things and a lot of times he didn't say thus says the Lord he he'd lean over to to maybe to Aaron and Aaron would say thus saith the Lord see Aaron never said let it be let it be Aaron was the prophet so the prophets going to deal with thus saith the Lord all right and that means God is speaking to you to tell you that's a wonderful thing to think about all the things that brother Branham spoken and said that's the staff the Lord in order to show you what I'm talking about see then men remember who was it sister Hattie right when or wonder of them there you know when he told him to say it they stuttered like in other words they paused a little bit and he says that's thus saith the Lord will see they called it because they could could hang on to the staff the Lord because they'd heard him down through his ministry speaking thus saith the Lord but did it come to a time no come on it came to a time that the word as they begin to unfold through the Prophet when he got into the seals he'd be preaching alone he say now that's thus saith the Lord see he wanted to keep your mind in the point of knowing where it was coming from but in that opening of the seals was bringing forth the word that had never been brought before the same creator that was back tyre the same one that stood back the artist said let there be and the world came into being which was the Word of God the Son of man stood then on earth the brought forth by the prophets right I'm off the message forgive me see the prophets built the body right John came to introduce the head then the Lord Jesus came to be the head of that see that's why those prophets then would thus saith the Lord because we were building the body but when Jesus came he didn't have to say that because he was the Lord Himself to speak the word brother Branham starts out son of man what does say if the Lord sure God used it thousands of thousands of times through the Ministry of the process then all at once he says now I say see his ministry begin to change he said I'm looking for this great thing to come and people missed it because they were looking for something to physically happen you know things and then you know all that they were had in their mind it's got to take place and this was going to be and that's going to be instead of looking at what he was saying his ministry changed just as it did there was Moses could say thus saith the Lord but then one day Moses wrote the entire book of the Old Testament and he didn't have to write the staff the Lord thus saith the Lord it was the Lord just come down so much and engulfed the man until he and the man became one tool even what did the Prophet say he said I used to wonder about how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something he said till I seen it was Christ in Moses now that wasn't the staff the Lord see when it comes to the Christ in Moses he didn't have to say thus saith the Lord he could say it and then come to Paes keep that in mind because that's what I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ see it's left in our hands sometimes until actually God leaves it to you and you can you could actually say something you ever had something so real until you could you could actually say thus saith the Lord oh no no no we're not well I'm thus saith the Lord I've Illustrated through when we're talking about Jesus was the Lord he didn't have to say that the prophets had to say thus saith the Lord because that was God speaking through them right okay now what are we talking about when we get to mark 11 or whatever it is into what we've quoting our moment ago when it says if you say if you say to this mountain he said not if I didn't brother branham I got it laying right here on the message speak to this mountain he said not if I say but if you say they speak the word that's too strong well don't worry about it if it ain't the word it ain't gonna work but at least you can step out on something every once in a while to begin to think a little bit about it and that's what I'm talkin about the Bride of Christ if the bride is part of the mystery from Christ the minister of God revealed all God was reporting the cross all Christ into the church and she's part of the mystery and must be revealed then being part of the mystery sees then it would be identically to the other ministries of the Bible it's not adding to or taken away yeah but but brother I we can see brother Branham now on whether the said well can you see brother ran him with a I say cuz he would actually as I said a lot of times he had to say that's that's thus saith the Lord to knock people back to a position that they would believe it because they had lost what he was doing but he was standing there saying I say I say no no that's nice too strong for - now you're getting on the wrong side of the car you know the thing go now you're you're beginning to doubt your prophet being able to say it but just remember that if you look at it correctly you'll say that's what I said about the Bible look at Moses back there who was that it told Moses now told Moses what happened in the garden but he wasn't sitting down her writings in well yo huh yeah that's dust saith the Lord okay no he and God had become so close Moses and God was so close together until it was this one person and he could write what happened right there in the garden that's what I told my brother he was he was talking one time about you know how that we use making too much of this at the end you know you can't I said if you'll just tell me what told Moses what happened in the garden wings solve the whole problem as there will be no argument me and you about the word just tell me who told Moses to write five books of course you know what that done cuz they're smart what most it's getting right before see trying to trap you out that don't go me off when it's four or five don't throw me off a lot of people Moses they're arguing about it and they do the the the religious rim argues over where the Moses wrote four books or five books maybe I shouldn't tell you that but what's it matter if they wrote two I still want them to you know just wrote one but get what I'm talking about you go back and you take what I'm trying to say to you and have been in the past few services trying to get you to see what you are and seeing it from where you come from from the Old Testament that Great Creator created the world and that was what was so amazing see when brother Branham made a statement he said it was the Sun that created but then he tells you real quickly that sunny is the word the word the word created I see the Son of man standing back they're saying let there be same one it was standing on earth one day only when he come into the flesh he didn't have to say let there be he said it is we're going to realize that think that's what I believe the Prophet was was talking about in the great things that he would say and he said we're looking for greater things to happen and then he would preach about Moses and speaking the word why Christ speak well that's just to Moses that was just a brother branham it's like the big man he's died and going on that's his business but he said that the third pool was only far brother branham and the Lord Jesus you know I mean that's we see everybody would quote that today well brother so-and-so said well I don't care that don't make it right because brother Dale said it but it makes it right when the Bible says it and the prophets message says it it makes it right to realize who we are we are his wife is that true and who does he who does the wife you know what does the husband put the emphasis on always on to the wife that's what Paul when he got over in their downfall speaking of Christ in the church making it equal and no one didn't realize him to start with that Eve was made co-equal with Adam unless she was made co Huichol with Adam can't you just see this is what kind of funny but somebody was bringing it out and opposite directions that's okay Oh what about it if if Adam was waiting on Eve to speak what's the problem with letting in speak the word I don't see the byproducts either quick thinking quick quick reaction but it's no good we'll see a byproduct of another product when you don't even look up the word by-product even the study nothing out it means of equal value our greater value as a by-product for let's see we don't want something like that because that that makes too much see to me I've just come to the place to preach I'm talking about the past year or so it's just built to the point to actually coming to the basis to preach God's Word no but the devil he's he's there in it that's good but what about it where would be the problem for Adam saying Eve what do you call dad she's the one that's a dog he said well that's good said God what do you think about it he said I think it's a dog you know I miss he's waiting on you and that's what I thought I thought that was the emphasis of the whole message that God is waiting on his bride to what speak the word and go forward with why cry speak only to brother branham or did he preach the message trying to get us we need to quit crying and start speaking then to see that the bride of Jesus Christ will be the Lord himself in human flesh called the son of man the word why can't you think about her being the word why can't we believe what the prophet has said well I just don't know you just see you just you making it you just make it too strong you make it you know yeah you make it like we're something I thought that's what we was [Music] come on I know we do it whatever you go to the wedding you go to a natural wedding hmm and what happens everybody's laughing and talking and won't know and they're getting this ready and they're getting that ready and they're making that ready and this gets ready for that way you know and when he do then here comes the preacher he comes walking out everybody gets a little quiet you know close when he starts out and hour comes to preacher and here comes the best man and here comes to the groom they're finding their places they're getting in place and everything happened all at once something takes place they're laughing and talking oh you got everything ready you got the ring you see that's what we have to do we have to go through all of that make sure everything's in the right place don't natural waiting all at once something happens if you can hear it the first you would hear a click mmm when is that the doors closing the real wedding that's where it's supposed to be now we don't go through all of them close the door nobody is to enter after that click comes to that closing that door I don't care who's outside he's not to enter why because the bride is fixing to step forth the most important party of the entire time of happening he's fixing to step forth all I want to hear everybody rises no more talking no more life and no more going on and then it starts from room to room and you're she comes walking down the most important party of the whole wedding process is now in view and the doors don't open to let in the maybe two or three maids or whatever cuz they're supposed to really go out first you know and do we know the story but get my point nobody enters the building when the bride enters there in nobody moves think about it here stands the groom up the front you know and go he's spellbound he's looking still nobody you know nobody said are you doing alright groom everything's okay we you know nobody don't don't the bride get what I'm talking about then we'll go on with the message if the bride is the most important part of a wedding that why would we be concerned about it now thinking about what thinks about you and me you realize he has put everything he's got everything he could ever make or think of he's put into the ark into us as the Bride of Christ and brought in the lice what I'm getting come on is the life days we get the revelation of all of this in the life stage we get to Revelation see not if the others didn't get a revelation but they didn't understand what Paul was trying to explain Christ in the church and he said I'm talking about a man and his wife and see why can't we think about then that the bride of Jesus Christ is the alive word and the alive word is decent of man the Lord Jesus Christ but he's in bride form then we get to the Book of Revelations and we start off with revelations 1 and he says when in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like under the son of man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle before he ever starts anything about the ages and what's taking place chapter 1 he describes the bride the whole chapter 1 is description to the bride sure it starts off with the groom because the groom is important yes and this but then he starts describing his bride then the church ages is what happens in the time elements of life we said 1-lakh unto the son of man who is that the Prophet said bride for Brod phone then he says it this way he said revelations 1 in revelation 10 1 is the same no no no no PN goes over to them see now you're making the group you're making the best man more important than the groom the lone making it more important than the bride itself see the Word of God the alive word is the son of man that's what I've taught from 1969 to where I am now and I certainly didn't gonna back off from it now and do it and believe in it because that's where I started at that was the first service I've ministered in this message oh yeah about 82 34 some of these others started talking about it and they started with Jordan I didn't make no lot of nobody I've never made no light because of that what you see we were already here in far advanced by the eighties in the son of man and that's been a been an upward thing ever since in for me but can we believe what the Prophet says well you just you're just making it a little bit too much emphasis too much emphasis on what when God put all of his whole emphasis if you ain't listening listen now the whole into our Bible is the emphasis God has put on the bride of Jesus Christ every Buddha this speaks of her she's the most important thing that there is that little bride okay come on What did he say and we know now what's my point I want to emphasize this back over brother branham was not decent man he was a son of man but now listen brother branham as a son of man that's where I've always put my emphasis for people to think on the greatest could be ever thought of you ever thought about this man was a born-again believer until that brother branham now okay because this is where I've always put it and believe it brother Branham was a born-again believer huh he was an adopted manifested son bringing him up to statue of a perfect man etc bringing through the adoptions in the stages and things like that only he was a church age messenger not to lady ousia but the eighth day messenger come on he's not the seventh church age messenger brother brothers not that you you better get in the message he said he said that make me lady Oh see huh huh but look at it he's a born-again believer he's an adopted manifested son he brings forth the word he's not the son of man he's a son of man well greater what greater could you make of him and what's he doing a church age messenger would be a great thing Paul cherry says he said his messenger to the Gentile but think about it a prophet very close to being able to say the Prophet so close to the man's ministry until it's hard to separate and let me say it the way he said it this message and the messenger can't be separated this message and the messenger can't be separated you can separate until you get to the message because the message the you understand brother branham was to be the answer to malachi for luke 1730 revelations 10 7 all of those scriptures that were waiting to be fulfilled what greater highs could you make him I always liked about what Paul brings and we just Paul is so straight when he says some and he's talking about that I'm a messenger to the Gentiles he says and he gets through there in a little bit and that while he says I magnify my own office didn't ever thought about what he said yeah he's not just saying he's trying to explain who he is and what he's doing and he said I'm magnified my own office I believe he was the fivefold ministry prophet don't you but I believe these church age messenger made him into the line of being a fivefold ministry prophet now you may differ women are but I said to messenger the messenger to each age I believe would Court would classify as to come into be to that position that he's higher than anybody else the Apostle Paul being the foundation to start with look at it he said and I magnify my own office he said I'm this and I'm that I'm done this is done he's an artist magnify my own office what did he step from a fivefold ministry prophet not into a prophetic realm that would cover all the ages in time that we all have to look back and here comes brother Branham run around and jump up above he had to look back he looked back to that prophet Paul bringing that word you know because he was spoke of in the Word of God to be that the messenger to the Gentiles all right see then he could come forth and find his self written in the word do you understand what I'm getting at you just think what it was for a man to stand here like a brother branham did and one day he would be as Malachi for that he would see itself as Malachi 4 in the scripture how much higher could you make it but look what he says he's revealing himself the Son of man spoke through a prophet to reveal himself to you and I then the prophet speaks right back to the bride to tell her who she is it was a great marvelous thing for Melek afford to be fulfilled but what about the bride of Jesus Christ to be fulfilled to realize who she is and that all the Bible speaks of her points at her and all of it is her come on let's just read a couple oh yeah I know I'm not gonna get to the end of this but I'll try to get part of it but I'm trying my best to get you this is this this morning has been just a price run-through of what I've been doing for 50 years I'm preaching 40-something years bump in 52 preach to get people to see who they are well brother told me one time he said he preached a message here and I didn't get it I mean I'm honest I didn't get our wasn't worldly talking about he's he kept preaching don't feed my sheep feed my sheep you know I knew him see and I knew he was beating at me I mean he ain't got no problem I knew what he was talking about but what was he talking about you know what was he trying to say then one day I kind of run around talking with him brought it into that realm he said I was trying my best to tell you to feed my children and get away from preaching on them shields and things that was the one that surprised me to think that somebody would think preaching the seals was something you don't need to preach you know or something you need to preach salvation but you know what I guess was up to it and walked away you know because of what he would come to this church of a morning service go home at my house and eat dinner with us get up and go home and never come back to the evening service he was wrong all over the country with his family see I wanted to say it but Ivan people thinks I'm so hard and so that it see I had an illegal right to say to him take your problem with your children's is you you taken him all over the country you're the one that's taking them out and doing it you need to be preaching to them living it before them I wanted to say that but on country too popular penny and I'm a better guy in there but you understand what I'm getting out he was preaching a couple of messages feed my sheep meaning I was preaching too deep for his family how can you preach too deep I won't know what deep is look the more I see this message of shallow way against whether you like that statement or not then you then you if you don't believe it you don't know what it's about it's the best way for me to say it the more the more you preach it the more simple that becomes I can see now how that Old Testament comes down and bring down that man God himself till he comes into human flesh and there it was the Son of man standing on earth and had to die in that position but before he died he created his bride because he spoke her into existence he planted the seed in other words the Bible says the Son of Man is the sower of the seed if there's any seed planted fields plant I mean the things you know imagined aboard any missions gotta come through there through that store of the seed here the rock I said I want to go here comes a prophet standing up there he doesn't get up there in the first field he said this is the staff and Lord now I want y'all listen no he starts preaching and he preaches he just keeps moving up moving up moving up and I thought he's gonna preach on the see you I admit it you never noticed you're going to see a book that starts off with God in simplicity and then it goes to the breach and to messages he had to preach before he could preach the seals you know why because he didn't know what they were cuz that's what he said he said Lord met me today or I'd have made a horrible mistake on seal number one you know what he was to do it he was preaching you know what he was doing he's taking all the Bible just what I don't want to go to go back to the son of man he was going back through that Bible and making sure that he had everything lined up to that word and then he comes to that breach and he could see hey wait a minute this thing got something to do with me now I realized that but I can't blast it out before I have to wait he doesn't come out on seal number one and say I'm gonna give you the staff the Lord he preaches it two three if you'll notice he gets on over about the third seal I believe one right now you can check it for danger you know I'm just making a point with it then he gets over into therefore he says this is the staff the Lord because like I said while ago people wouldn't believe in what he was doing but when he clicked him with us that the Lord is they'd so used to that till they clicked back hey wait a minute listen and he starts bringing that out and he's and then we can see the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ coming on the scene through the revealed word then he comes over to seal number one and he stands there this is about 156 or something steelbook and he stands there and he says here stands a lamb with a book in his hand then out are goes the white horse rider looking like he was talking literally of his own self in that sense he was but he said here stands a lie him but he was talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and said out there goes a white horse rider he says that I cannot be that cannot be the Lord Jesus Christ that we thought because here stands the Lord Jesus Christ with the lamb in the book in his ass and said after going he was making it so personal under when he said in a minute he said I'd done it he's talking about to open into the seals in and I remember the brother preaching it and saying to me one day said you think that might have been brother branham you know when he said it he he could he was preaching it like so much of his own self I said no brother that wasn't that wasn't brother Branham he wasn't when he said I done it it wasn't him he put the emphasis in the right place come on listen but think about it let's just read a few cuz I want you to keep this part about the son of man because to me the son of man the fullness of the Godhead bodily all of these things that I've been preaching on lately getting up to work wanna preach on the wave sheath and time all of that is about the bride in her word and her message is but it's so simple going to number one take him to the message of trial in these last days a son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people not son of God that was down to the church ages as a son of God because see when he died at Calvary he released that life that was in him which was the holy spirit there's your son of God through the seven churches was that holy spirit but that Holy Spirit is put out you say run around and said it was you say what no no no no then people out there walking they don't walk the Holy Spirit they don't want the word the Spirit being one oh they want to shout they want the glory they want to healings and signs and the wonders they don't want the word they put the word out then he can come forth when he did it can come forth a son of man listen they not son of God my son of David was son of man look at him the son of God was the supernatural they put the supernatural out claiming to believe it no wonder they didn't want brother ran him around he's telling them to go to the message and study where he talks about Azusa Street and how that they put God out of the church and he's on the outside knocking to get back in that ain't the son of man son of man I ain't trying to not to get back in the church called he the son of man was never put out of the church he's got to come forth in a manifestation to be put out the Holy Ghost came forth in a manifestation and they put him out of the church no no no they won't even if you're er they wanted for healing and signs and wonders they don't want the word wise the people this message hate it so much why are they trying so much now to destroy the very message that they claim to be right and I ain't talking about all of them to put it out I'm talking about the ones that does it under current you know what about it Church the last days in the forum are in Moorthy among his people in the form of his people in the form of his people so you can preach spread around on that son of man he's priests brother branham there's no sign and everybody's so tickled to death but no he's talking about the people didn't say when the Prophet realized who he was gonna do know he had already realized who he was when the bride begins to okay come on let's get her go ahead on down he said that it wasn't a days it's autumn so she only be in the coming son of man son of God coming excuse me when the Son of man shall be revealed the son of man being revealed not the son of God in the church age he's put out of that now he son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh among us oh yeah it's becoming flesh in Werder Bremen brother Branham is that better a man or somebody that's fault fifty years to try to make and clear up and try to record this always seem to have been and I'm sorry I'm just plain it's always seem to have been my ministry to where all of these things come up to souls to Lord seven Thunder virtuous perusing all that I was the one that it's like that was in The ministers meeting one day and they were having it about some and then they said come on brother Dale I said well I got a speak they wanted to help but I want to keep my mouth shut cause I like people and I knew felt my mouth I think the people ain't gonna like me I've always tried to do everything I could to try to help the people of this message yeah let's see you go on dinner yeah okay now we go down to number three sirs we would see Jesus that's right number yeah okay number two take a little State with that and then Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifests himself in the last days now what a wonderful statement if Jesus was God in flesh we know that he come down in sin he work out he come down when in him that's the same way for you and I and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last day the Son of Man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it God down here in his church making itself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom God revealed in human flesh no but you've everybody but we think you destroyed brother Branham or tell me show me okay go to number four don't you see it can't be what we think I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world they come down through the apostles inside are excess and then the Holy Spirit wasn't only in one person it's in the entire Church Universal doing the same works that Jesus did hallelu you know what what he said I challenge the world to believe that and you'll see a revival breakthrough in this country I say it to the church in Lula if you want to see a revival a lot of who you are and what's taking place [Applause] you don't have to worry about it it'll take care of itself okay number five and then there would come a time from across the mystery God revealed on 4th when he could express himself in fullness of his Godhead the deity through the end time prophet now that any what it says but that's what you reading because you'll read it for that and amen but you won't read it when it says through his church having the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why excepting one Eve turndown and Adam coming back with the anointing of the world God he said my word is spirit the anointing with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept the pride the bride anointed with the word okay go ahead to the next one the unveiling God notice now he came first as the prophet okay now there's the Old Testament one becomes the profit and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man okay they crucified the Son of man they did not crucify the Son of God on Calvary because the Son of God is spirit God and he couldn't die in that way so he had to take and that anointing that came on him that we've all tried to preach in the northern came on him on the river Jordan it had to leave him in the Garden of Gethsemane the Prophet said where he could die as a man they couldn't kill him with that anointing on him now listen here's one thing I've always tried to say so listen they couldn't kill him with that anointing on him it had to leave before he could die you can't die with the anointing that's on you now if you'll believe it and accept it you can't die cuz see we're not gonna do like it goes off of us and let's go by the grave we're going in a rapture so the anointing not gonna leave us the anointing gonna take us out of here right come on and after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God God is a spirit he was His Holy Spirit son of God he lived through the church ages as son of God then the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David now you remember I remember I've always said this when I read that I always said it when we believe it see he's son of that he he's son of God son of man son of David Rose of Sharon living a valley bright morning star Alpha Omega he's all those things to us already because we're talking about by revelation but physically he hasn't come to them since those places he hasn't come - son of David yet but we can call him son of David come we know who he is and then if nothing else happens we can say and well let me get the crumbs they falls from the table at least a little bit give me that and the Millennium he be son of David sitting on throwing his father David he is the son of David now and remember between the Son of God in the lady of C an age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again a son of man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it and the Scriptures type perfectly together son of man son of God son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form he morphe he just changed it it's a great drama to him he is acting it out what about at church do you see what I'm talking about through the church ages he would be son of God but in all that wants just something happens right at the end of the seventh church age something takes place and when it does the ours were Malachi 4 comes in Malachi 4 comes in at that point Luke 17 30 just as it did back just as the Old Testament was ending [Music] and you come in with Elijah John the Baptist then the Lord Jesus came well that's what we're supposed to do now brother Branham was to come in the last days return the hearts of the Father and the Lord Jesus is to come on this thing or in his pride because it's not a form there to put it anywhere else if you're listening see you gotta go son of man son of God son of man made way for the Son of God to come into be son of God in the church ages makes way for the son of David to come into be which you can't go from son of God I've tried to explain this and people just look at you you can't go from son of day a son of God in the church ages to son of David that's too far of a jump you can't do it you got to come back to the son of man let that son of man come in for just a little bit then we can go to the Millennium and he can be the son of David but he'll work on the beers hug his wife in the Millennium we ain't gonna be worried about worthy son God son of David he's gonna be our sweetheart we're gonna have pet names if you want to get with it we'll talk about it you say well what about the new name well what is the new name ain't got rid of Jesus yet I'm still believing in that but they did there's going to be a sweetheart named right it won't be Redemption it won't be nothing like that if you want a new name make it to be something that sweetheart you know well you call her boy babe I hear you say babe I don't think he's talking about my wife I know who he's talking about but are you getting it I hate to keep repeating but through the church ages all right let's go to number seven this depicts have another movement try to catch up who is this son of man what he's asking the question in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was caught in the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us can I say it like this who is this son of man the Creator God who creates all things and without him there's not anything made of corn or the Bible said that was made unless he creates it in every bit of it everything is always a new creation everything begins for the new creation has got - okay look the Book of Luke here as we just quoted and Luke the 17th chapter in the 30th verse Malachi for the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with baptism of the holy spirit right among us and he's giving us life among us the bride what about it what about it I don't want to go too far because you know you get into different situations but I want to say something to you just to ask you a question do you believe it's possible after all we've studied to the Bible and the message and thing is it possible for us to realize who we are and to realize that he has done ever better this himself and made manifest about a group of people that can believe him well why not he's talking about us when we're gonna realize that he's talking about I said she all makes the whole whole thing a whole lot easier to talk about if you realize he's talking about you brother Ryan no I mean should that be the most wonderful thing to think about that we've come all of these years to come to find out but God all these years he's been trying to talk to us about this to get us to see who we are I mean I've been around 50 years some of you 20 30 40 whatever you know your - whatever about it even the whole thing has been pointing to the bride of Jesus cry see how much God values and honors its wife that's why it says overdone revelation you know he said and his wife has made herself ready didn't say bride in that situation now come on he doesn't leave it out cause you turn over about two or three more chapters you tell them it's a bride so don't just understand it understand what's being say it a wife is a greater point of understanding than a to say a bride a bride is the little girl walking down the are know the aisles and you know the that situation whereas a a wife is a seasoned lady I say it was respect of all things she seasoned because she understands that's a real wife he knows the different things right all right now listen let me let me get this but is it possible to you to think about that without the bride the fullness of the Godhead is incomplete you remember that how many services and we went over and over and over the message leaning hundred I don't understand him God isn't complete without you you realize if you're talking about the fullness of the Godhead bodily you've got to be talking about the bride because without her in her correct position the fullness is not here yeah but that's making to it no it's not making enough we ever get around to preaching on predestination we'll go back before the foundation of the world and start back dire and see what the word really is [Music] the word was dire the word was that creator that cut step forth and said let there be No what about it what about it Church let's just read a few of these right here and then I'll quit on it I'll drop off the I want you to get on the wave sheaf and stuff like that and we'll be on that neck so you know do it let's go to number eight and we're gonna try to read fast and run okay but all of God he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily all of God was poured into Christ all that God was in Christ and all that Christ he is is poured out on the church I just can't see how that wait a minute I wonder is that one he said Dan but you keep refusing it you keep refusing who you are well I just I just don't ya see what you need is the new birth kind of say it that way without hurting feelings what you need is the new birth you know what I've had to do it well now you need more feelings you need more growth in the stature of perfect land right but look what he says but you keep refusing go to the net that was off the message at Good Shepherd this is off the paddlers vision God being revealed in Christ how many believes it God was revealed in Christ Joel were revealed in Christ now where's God to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same on manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace mercy all that was in crisis in the church remember keep that in mind all that God was he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily and all that Christ was he poured into the church what would that be God above us God with us God in us died try unity of God God manifested in three different manners father son long ago take take the distal little call fullness of the Godhead bodily spell it two different ways now when you when you type it in spell it he was the full ful in ESS go with that then back up and go with he was the fu ll in the SS and you pick up a whole lot more and read how many times brother Branham uses that statement and it ever time that he uses it he finalizes with what all God was he poured into Christ all Christ is poured into the church take us back to the Garden of Eden Christ the mystery of God revealed and read how many times he says that but we know now here's the reason we can go ahead to the next because this is our problem God's only provided place of worship no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness out of Godhead bodily among you what's 11 let's let him say it couldn't do it Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age but in the day when the Son of Man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet now what was it he couldn't do it in Wesley's age why absence of word absence of people to realize who they are can I stay at that away couldn't do it Wesley absence of people who could not take the word for what it was they come up with a Trinitarian con fail Pentecostals come up with a corner with the Trinity and signs and and things like that you know speaking in tongues etc etc they couldn't stand the revealed word so they put it out though when the word goes out of a church the Holy Spirit automatically goes cuz that's what it is working spirit of one no livin what is living denominationalism your ideas and my ideas contrary to God's Word is living and we've had them until these virtues come in us we are subject to all of the faults and failures of life and understanding and denominationalism xingtai well I've been out of the nomination that's what I said when I left the Baptist Church just ended up from a church or in games when I said somebody said something and I said well I got out of the Baptist now I want the Baptist out of me you said well I left the denomination will have their denomination left you I mean that's as serious as I can be because see I preach like that things that you don't believe in gifts and signs and wonders you don't you don't talk like that to this land when I have told you many many manifestations of God in what has happened even to be able to smell the presence of Almighty God what I said you don't do it when you say well we don't have these signs and wonders why we've seen the dead raise the sick heal we've seen strong spoke into existence we've seen rain come rain leave we've seen everything could be thought of in every room that could be thought of in this little church when I ain't don't see it well why don't you go somewheres else where you can see I'm not sarcastic and their hateful with that I'm just saying if you're sitting here well I don't see it well go somewhere else where you can find it because we got to get out of here when wife was asking me yesterday she said how long do you think this thing can go I said I don't know I said I know this much if things don't happen pretty quick the economy's gone you say what you want to they're doing this they're doing that I'll get back to that sort of what I told her it's gone but then they turn around and open this thing back up and all at once you get a double portion of that demon of death coming upon the people you're gonna be blaming the president for it you're gonna be doing a whole kind of thing and you're gonna be down one of them two is going to take place pretty quickly how quick I don't know ain't nothing but I know one thing for sure only those who are anchored in the word will be able to stand the trials and the tests this fights coming in on us and you think I'm gonna just quit on that part and you think oh it can't come on us you said that six months ago a lot of you did this can't happen that came out but we're bride six months ago you said that I'm even making no dates and I'm just saying it I'm just saying related to what you seeing who thought six months ago that they could just shut down schools they take a shutdown cafes they take a shut down businesses General Motors close has to be set down because of somebody with one disease see now the Buffalo point of behind is got out of the kind of the way and now your news media is dealing with what were to dis start and they're already declaring now that they know it started in China and they're already demanding China to make payments what if this was a man-made thing let me say it this way I don't care what you think it was it was a man-made thing something went wrong diseases and things comes and stuff going wrong not necessarily somebody planning for it to be that way if something goes wrong you think we're not in the end time all they got to do is say no more traveling what if they come out now what if what if things started turning around a little bit and all that once they spent we later dive downward what are they gonna do you won't be able to travel you won't be able to go nowhere you won't be able to go to church you won't be able to go to work you won't be able to do nothing they don't know they can close all that down what are you gonna do the I'd be I'd be so scared to death so I could understand it if I didn't know what the Prophet is talk I would I'd literally be I probably they said they're jumping out of the buildings and everything else you know there's no depression my lord i guy I blow the building up with me in here why because listen there's nothing you can do there's nothing they can do they son said it it's done they can face all the laws that won't too thing bar all the money they want to but who's gonna pay it back if everything went smooth and the disease died today and no more - you realize how long it take to get this economy back going and rolling and you realize all the money it would take to do it with and you realize where you gonna get that money from and you realize that according to now I'm talking about loaning like you think loaning I'm talking about world governments etc and and all of that you realize that China is one of our biggest lender now through the money market of the world I'm talking about we borrowed money from China you realize how close we are to what could happen but can you say come on Lord and get us out of here help us to realize who we are and what we're doing here help us to get out of here get away from this plane they will serve Him and be what he wants to but it's still no matter what happens or takes place we still glory in our God and Savior and then knowing that he is the only one that can carry us through anything let's tan what about musicians come on I really meant to try to get on in to the fullness of the Godhead bodily God brother Branham talks about that to the bride so I wrote these down in my Bible in 1969 and read them I have a whole lot more than I had then to put my basis on I realized when that bride realized who she is and what she here for she's gonna be an investable army why cause it's not afraid not afraid no what are you gonna do if they come in close the doors we'll figure out some other way we'll take care of it we'll do the best we can little bride has not been forsaken he's being tried to see what she'll do we can't go out what is the scripture for you knew with the footmen what about when the horseman gets here you know and if you can't dwell in the what is the swelling of the Jordan and all I had the scriptures if you can't keep up with a footman if you can't abide with things little things happening and going on what about one that really fired I am until you 19 and 74 they passed a law in Georgia you could not travel over 25 miles to church that pretty well ends just about all of this church what we're gonna do but the thing about it is he took care of us so far go ahead pass me no say you're here my humble you in secret there's three messages of it [Music] father on behind some of these days and waiting bringing in these others you see it where we're at what's going on when I
