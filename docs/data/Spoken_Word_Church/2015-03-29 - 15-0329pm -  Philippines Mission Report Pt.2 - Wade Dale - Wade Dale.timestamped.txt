[22:14] amen uh let's go and get started but I
[22:16] want to read you something that that I
[22:18] want you to pray about brother Homer
[22:20] Frasier uh they're going to take his leg
[22:22] off
[22:24] tomorrow so uh this evening for those of
[22:27] you that know what Caring Bridge is it's
[22:30] a um place where you can put online
[22:33] what's going on with the people in the
[22:36] hospital so sister Connie wrote said
[22:38] this evening we had a meeting with the
[22:39] team doctors they think it's best that
[22:41] Dad should have his leg amputated above
[22:43] the knee unless something changes this
[22:46] will be done on Monday he told us if Dad
[22:49] kept his leg and there isn't a promise
[22:51] he would keep it that he would be
[22:53] through have to go through 12 to 15 more
[22:55] surgeries in the next year and he would
[22:58] be in and out of the hospital rehab and
[23:00] nursing home so he made the decision
[23:02] brother Homer made the decision to go
[23:04] ahead and remove the leg because he had
[23:05] been at a week in state and said he
[23:07] didn't know if he was strong enough to
[23:09] go through that many more surgeries cuz
[23:11] he's in his 80s and he had that tractor
[23:14] accident and they're they're um they
[23:16] saying he'll feel better once this
[23:18] happens so let's keep brother Homer
[23:20] Frasier in our prayers we all most of us
[23:24] know who he is and a good breth in the
[23:26] Lord in his 80s track accident several
[23:29] months ago so let's just keep him in
[23:30] prayer as we go to the Lord let's bow
[23:33] our heads dear heavenly father you're
[23:35] still Jehovah jyra you're still the
[23:38] Healer and the provider we pray that
[23:41] you'd bless brother Homer Lord being a
[23:44] good friend of ours plus a brother Lord
[23:45] we pray that You' just touch him Lord
[23:48] just be with him and take that infection
[23:50] away Lord we know that nothing's
[23:53] impossible for you father we pray here
[23:56] in the building if there be anyone
[23:57] that's sick and the ones that are are
[23:58] not here Lord we pray that you'd heal
[24:00] them Father now we ask your blessings on
[24:02] everyone Lord that's that's here today
[24:05] Father we pray that you'd be the
[24:06] preeminent one in the service you take
[24:08] over you do the speaking you do the
[24:10] hearing you do the revealing father just
[24:12] be with us and bless us take care of us
[24:15] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[24:16] in Jesus name we pray amen let's turn to
[24:20] the book of
[24:22] Acts very familiar scripture but we're
[24:24] going to start with verse 36
[24:31] says therefore let all the house of
[24:32] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[24:34] that same Jesus whom you have crucified
[24:37] both Lord and Christ now when they heard
[24:39] this they were pricked in their heart
[24:41] remember Peter's preaching them a sermon
[24:44] amen Peter pet Peter is preaching the
[24:47] gospel to the 3,000 downstairs now when
[24:51] they heard this they were pricked in
[24:52] their heart and said unto Peter and the
[24:54] rest of the Apostles men and Brethren
[24:55] what shall we do verse 38 and Peter said
[24:58] unto them repent and be baptized every
[25:01] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[25:02] for the remission of sins and you shall
[25:04] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[25:06] the promis is unto you and to your
[25:08] children and to all that are a far off
[25:10] even as many as our Lord Our God shall
[25:12] call and with many other words did he
[25:14] testify and exhort saying save yourself
[25:16] from this untour generation then they
[25:19] that gladly receive his word were
[25:21] baptized the same day they were added
[25:23] unto them about 3,000 Souls now we'd
[25:26] have a Revival if we could add 3,000
[25:27] Souls we'd have a Revival if we could
[25:29] had
[25:31] three and they continued steadfastly in
[25:34] the apostles Doctrine and fellowship so
[25:37] that so my whole part is watch what he's
[25:40] saying here and they continued steadfast
[25:43] in the apostles Doctrine in Fellowship
[25:45] it wasn't the apostles Doctrine it was
[25:47] the Lord Jesus Christ doctrine that the
[25:49] apostles were given to the people and
[25:51] they continued steadfast in that
[25:54] Doctrine and fellowship they didn't
[25:57] fellowship with him and in leave they
[25:58] fellowship and in Breaking of bread and
[26:01] in prayer and Fe fear Came Upon every
[26:03] soul and Many Wonders and signs were
[26:04] done by the apostles and all that
[26:07] believe were together and had all things
[26:09] in common you may be seated in the Lord
[26:10] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[26:12] word because we
[26:13] did the one of the highlights that we'll
[26:16] get to in just a moment was going to the
[26:19] island of
[26:20] palan and going through a mystery Expo
[26:25] now for those of you that are new or
[26:26] don't know what a mystery Expo is is
[26:29] what they started years ago several
[26:31] years ago is they would they would go
[26:35] out among the denominational churches
[26:37] and they would advertise that they were
[26:40] going to have a mystery Expo Mysteries
[26:44] of the Bible they were going to bring a
[26:47] group of people together and we're going
[26:50] to explain some of the Mysteries of the
[26:52] Bible Well if you make it a mystery Expo
[26:56] and you advertise it and feed
[27:00] them and feed them they'll show up so

[27:20] denominational ministers about the end
[27:23] time message but not say brother Ram's
[27:26] name until the very end okay not not

[32:55] remember when brother Danny visited your
[32:56] place he told me good things about your
[32:58] family that's why when I heard brother
[33:00] Wade it was coming I'm thinking about
[33:02] what things to make him happy and I'm so
[33:05] amazed because he was more humorous than
[33:08] us he always told us that we were crazy
[33:11] people but I noticed he was more
[33:12] comedian than us anyway we appreciate
[33:16] him so much he delivered his message
[33:17] more deeper and easily to understand we
[33:20] are
[33:22] blessed no looking forward to seeing him
[33:24] again together with you in the
[33:26] Philippines so she reminds me a lot of

[35:01] conditioners on the wall yeah fans yeah
[35:05] this is the Youth of the church all
[35:06] right keep
[35:07] going and brother roel they asked him to
[35:10] pray for the family this is Brother Dany
[35:13] his wife daughter and three sons this
[35:15] one right here was born with a hole in
[35:17] his heart and God just closed that thing
[35:19] right
[35:20] up when he was young didn't you know
[35:24] didn't think he was going to survive so
[35:25] anyway so brother royel was praying over
[35:27] the family so go
[35:28] ahead then this is when we get started
[35:31] and when we get started brother Danny's
[35:33] interpreting for me and I told him I
[35:35] said look I I told them at first I mean
[35:37] they're all sitting on the edge of their
[35:39] seat cuz you're new and they don't know
[35:41] what you're going to say and and but
[35:42] we're standing just like that but when I
[35:44] get finished praying I look over at
[35:46] brother Danny and I told the people I
[35:47] said can I ask you a question they said
[35:49] yeah go ahead ask you know they okay I
[35:51] said which looks more like a Filipino me
[35:53] or him I said he looks like the American
[35:56] and I look like the Filipino so they all
[35:57] laughed about it you know kind of broke
[35:59] the ice so anyway so I'm preaching away
[36:02] and keep
[36:04] going and brother Danny's interpreting
[36:07] keep
[36:08] going and then brother Danny's
[36:10] interpreting keep going then I start and
[36:14] I what I did is I preached on the three
[36:15] stages of justification you know before
[36:18] you get into the body and then three
[36:20] stages of justification sanctification
[36:21] baptism holy ghost in Three Stages here
[36:23] so the three stages of adoption in with
[36:26] the Statue of a perfect man and they
[36:27] really enjoyed it but keep going so you
[36:30] see brother Danny's there well now I
[36:33] noticed that when I would preach when
[36:36] I'd say something they were amening
[36:39] before brother Dany would
[36:41] interpret so I was noticing that and
[36:43] then keep
[36:44] going brother Danny's there this is a
[36:46] little bit further on in to about right
[36:48] there then you're going to notice he
[36:50] goes over here and sits down brother
[36:51] roel says he just speaks up he speaks up
[36:54] he said brother Danny I think you can
[36:56] sit down now I think they're
[36:57] understanding what he's saying cuz they
[36:59] were amening me before brother Danny was
[37:01] able to to interpret so brother Danny
[37:03] just lays the microphone down and goes
[37:05] over and sits down so I'm you know I'm
[37:07] flying then I'm I'm not having to wait
[37:09] on interpreter cuz you have to wait you
[37:12] have to wait you have to wait till he
[37:13] gets finished so all right go ahead so
[37:16] keep
[37:16] going so now he's over here and we're
[37:19] almost finished but brother Danny's over
[37:20] there so we had a good time in the Lord
[37:22] they they really enjoyed it and I
[37:23] enjoyed it and uh keep going
[37:27] and but there was about 30 all these
[37:30] right here are
[37:31] ministers all these right here actually
[37:34] those are pastors some sitting over here
[37:37] and some sitting here so it was really
[37:39] good that we were able to to speak not
[37:41] only to the Ley but to the to the
[37:43] ministers and if you read that what
[37:45] brother Vernon said that it was a real
[37:47] good impact because a lot of ministers
[37:49] were there to listen because you know
[37:51] what you can't preach to every
[37:53] congregation right so but if you can
[37:55] preach to the ministers and they can
[37:57] catch what you're saying they can take
[37:58] it to their congregation cuz they live
[38:00] with the people and that's exactly what
[38:02] I wanted to do that was my goal was to
[38:05] get the ministers in the mindset of
[38:07] maturity and of the Statue of a perfect
[38:09] man and of those things in the Lord
[38:11] maybe a little bit higher than they had
[38:14] seen it so go ahead then brother Danny
[38:17] starts
[38:18] preaching he catches it and he starts
[38:20] preaching and he preaches for about 15
[38:22] or 20 minutes so but anyway it's an
[38:24] anniversary meeting they don't listen
[38:26] they don't watch their clock
[38:28] they they don't care it be 9:00 at night
[38:30] they didn't matter to them so go
[38:33] ahead then brother Royale dedicated this
[38:36] uh child and the family with them so
[38:39] keep
[38:40] going and then this is all this is
[38:42] brother Danny and this is his deacons
[38:43] and preachers right here Jojo and all
[38:45] them uh they had brother Nester pray
[38:48] over them and each one of the services
[38:51] they had that uh opportunity to bring
[38:53] all the ministers and all the deacons up
[38:56] and have prayer over them so so that's
[38:57] what happened there go
[38:59] ahead then we
[39:02] ate all right there's brother Val and
[39:05] that's brother dendo brother Danny now
[39:07] keep
[39:08] going there's the
[39:10] duck the ducks in that bowl well the two
[39:13] ducks the sacrificial ducks are in that
[39:14] bowl right there and uh they were good
[39:18] we ate them it was good food it was good
[39:20] it was really good and um we all enjoyed
[39:24] it so keep going and this is brother Joe
[39:27] I wanted to show this for Dad when Dad
[39:29] was over there this one wasn't born and
[39:30] this one wasn't born and that one was a
[39:32] baby and he only had those two girls so
[39:34] they've grown up he's done real well
[39:36] this is his home he has good roof and
[39:39] good place obviously God has blessed him
[39:42] amen and he's kind of a jack of all
[39:44] trades but he really loves brother Dale
[39:45] no doubt he sent me a text message just
[39:48] a little while ago well yesterday two
[39:50] days ago and said that he wanted to come
[39:52] over here and drive for us
[39:57] okay
[39:58] whatever but anyway I thought JoJo you'd
[40:02] run all over people but anyway that's
[40:04] for brother that's it brother Danny's
[40:05] anniversary meeting so we left there and
[40:09] when we left there we went to Brother
[40:10] Royal's now brother Dany and brother
[40:13] Vernon did not go with us anymore
[40:15] brother Danny came to the meeting at
[40:17] brother Royal's but from now on I'm
[40:18] going to be with with brother Royal Sano
[40:21] so go to the next slide this is Brother
[40:24] Royals this is uh I think we we dedic
[40:27] dedicated something I can't remember
[40:28] what all it was we dedicated but um this
[40:31] is his Fellowship Hall that's not all
[40:33] the way finished yet keep going I took
[40:35] some of these pictures now he has a big
[40:37] church but all this is done by the
[40:40] Believers there was no money spent
[40:43] outside that was all the architect he's
[40:45] got two or three Architects plus brother
[40:46] royel is an architect so they did all
[40:49] this design their own self they built it
[40:51] their own self and it's beautiful all
[40:54] right so go ahead and that's the back
[40:57] with the
[40:58] balcony all right go ahead and that's
[41:02] looking up from the balcony down all
[41:04] right and that's the name of their
[41:06] Church Overcomers Worship Center where
[41:08] Jesus Christ Alone takes preeminence all
[41:10] right next slide this is the front of it
[41:13] all right you come in here go back
[41:16] Anderson are you back there no but right
[41:19] here I wanted to show this picture cuz
[41:20] right here is the uh that's an apartment
[41:23] that's where I stayed the other week and
[41:25] a half I was there I stayed in that
[41:26] apartment when we weren't in plowing but
[41:29] all this is secure somebody lives at the
[41:32] church all the time there's no way
[41:34] somebody can get in without somebody
[41:35] letting you in but this is an apartment
[41:38] right here is a door and that's where I
[41:40] stayed so it was all safe and sound it
[41:43] was just a real nice place you were
[41:44] there Louise you yeah okay all right go
[41:46] ahead very functional so the next day we
[41:49] didn't have anything to do so we went up
[41:51] on top of the mountain looked out over
[41:52] there and I thought somebody started a
[41:54] fire but it was smog so
[41:57] they said no brother that's smog so we
[41:59] were we were just sightseing that day go
[42:02] ahead now the night that we got back
[42:06] from there that day all the deacons and
[42:09] this is all his deacons and preachers
[42:10] got together in the evening and we we
[42:12] had a conversation of anything from this
[42:16] brother was interested in bees so we
[42:17] talked about honey bees that we were
[42:19] talking about the Lord we were talking
[42:20] about all different things about the the
[42:22] island and before we left to go to palan
[42:24] they all wanted to get together and pray
[42:26] so these are all the deacons and all the
[42:28] Elders of the Church of brother royel so
[42:32] a very uh tight-knit group of people all
[42:35] right so go
[42:36] ahead and that's the next day we flew on
[42:40] SIU Pacific plane was packed full of
[42:42] people I saw more Americans on this
[42:45] island than I saw in the ho of manella
[42:47] because it's a vacation spot um kind of
[42:51] a resort island in the um South part of
[42:56] of of the Philippines so go to the next
[42:57] slide that we flew into Porto Princessa
[43:01] airport and that's where we stayed at a
[43:03] motel there and then we did our Outreach
[43:06] from there and that's actually where the
[43:08] mystery Expo was was in in PTO Princessa
[43:12] okay which means P of the princess now

[43:22] going that's me and brother Royale
[43:25] taking a selfie I don't do that but but
[43:27] it looked good go ahead so there we are
[43:30] sitting in and I mean there's thousands
[43:32] of these things and I mean they're
[43:34] enclosed and got a motorcycle and the
[43:37] problem with these things are is they're
[43:39] not made for big
[43:42] Americans Aaron would have had to PID
[43:46] double cuz me and brother royel got in
[43:49] this one the purple one and we were
[43:50] going to see another beekeeper and he
[43:52] had closed so we go out through here and
[43:54] we could both sit side by side but I had
[43:55] to have my arm around him but when we
[43:57] come back we got go ahead show the next
[43:59] one we got into this flowery colored
[44:02] looking one and it was made for two
[44:04] Philipino children to sit in I had to
[44:07] sit right up here real close to the edge
[44:09] and brother royel was behind me and
[44:11] there was another brother sitting over
[44:12] here well one of us had to get out for
[44:14] it to go up a
[44:17] hill I told the guy I said I'm sorry not
[44:20] made for these big americanos to sit in
[44:22] this thing and he just looked at me and
[44:24] laughed you know but he said one of
[44:25] y'all got to get out
[44:27] cuz 150 CC's plus hauling all that plus
[44:30] hauling all this um didn't make it so we
[44:34] had to get out but the place we met keep
[44:35] going the place we met was here it was
[44:38] an open air restaurant owned by one of
[44:40] the daughters of the um mayor not mayor
[44:45] but the congressman of the island so
[44:47] there was a big mansion sitting right
[44:49] over here and this is her restaurant but
[44:50] it was on top of a hill I'm talking
[44:52] about like this that's why we had to get
[44:54] out and let some of them walk and get
[44:56] another buggy
[44:57] but this is Brother roel that's brother
[44:59] this is Brother Leto solo
[45:02] now he's a good
[45:04] one that guy leaves his family for three
[45:07] months to come on this island and preach

[48:06] right go ahead and then brother royel he
[48:09] interpreted for me that light right
[48:11] there was about right here hanging on my
[48:14] head that well you can see how far it is
[48:16] from his head to the ceiling it my head
[48:18] wasn't this far from the ceiling so that
[48:20] light was burning my head up anyway so
[48:23] go
[48:24] ahead there's brother Nelson yeah see
[48:26] how long that light is and he's very
[48:28] short and it's right there at his head
[48:29] so I had to get away from it go ahead so
[48:34] there's the church all right go keep
[48:35] going that's brother Nelson his wife and
[48:38] the children all right now oh go back
[48:43] now brother Nelson was sitting and I I
[48:45] don't have a picture but I I I would
[48:48] have loved to had one it's that's the
[48:49] one brother Donnie I told brother Donnie
[48:52] fush that brother was playing the guitar
[48:55] during the during the song service and I
[48:57] looked over at the guitar and it's
[48:59] uh oh it's about like that one that
[49:02] Chris plays and it looked like they had
[49:05] drag it down the dirt road for 2 miles
[49:07] drag it back down the dirt road 20 years
[49:10] ago and then I mean it was so rough it
[49:13] wasn't black anymore it was
[49:15] gray and every time about
[49:18] every minute or less than a minute he's
[49:21] playing away on this electric guitar and
[49:24] the cord falls out
[49:28] he goes and he has to stop reach and
[49:30] plug it back in well I'll make a long
[49:32] story
[49:35] short thanks to you he's got a new
[49:41] guitar you'll see them in a minute but I
[49:43] we bought four you know what epitone is
[49:46] right that's a offshoot from a Gibson we
[49:50] found a store that had we bought an
[49:52] electric guitar and three acoustic
[49:55] guitars and I'll show you who they went
[49:56] to for less than
[49:59] $400 less it was like
[50:02] $365 they gave us 25% off and that was
[50:05] probably one of the biggest sales they'
[50:06] made in a year or two in that little
[50:08] store but they gave us a good price so
[50:10] now brother Nelson has a guitard almost
[50:13] like that one but it's an epitone which
[50:15] is good that's okay for them and it
[50:17] won't sound like he's you know it's uh
[50:21] all broke down so he he didn't know that
[50:24] until now and brother Vernon sent me a
[50:26] um I mean brother Royal sent a note back
[50:29] said that he said thank you cuz he
[50:31] didn't get it till after we had already
[50:32] left all right so go ahead now this is
[50:35] where this is where it gets
[50:37] fun this is the mystery Expo and I want
[50:41] you to look at this and I want you to
[50:43] realize one thing these people we we
[50:46] think we give our life for the gospel
[50:49] when we come into the message of the
[50:51] hour and maybe our family will turn
[50:54] against us or something this brother

[51:02] is gelito cahilig he was 45 years he was
[51:06] a Baptist preacher Baptist pastor at a
[51:10] big Baptist Church on the island for 45
[51:15] years several month well less than a
[51:18] year ago he came to an mystery Expo and
[51:20] accepted the message they kicked him out
[51:23] of the church and most of his family

[51:27] him but you know what he said to God be
[51:32] the
[51:34] glory he's claiming his family four of
[51:37] his five sons are Baptist preachers so
[51:41] they're really giving him a hard time
[51:43] but he come out of that church and
[51:46] started evangelizing preaching the
[51:48] message of the hour and he has no
[51:51] reservation he said I'd do it

[54:57] a tribal chief of the
[54:59] palan tribe there on the island this
[55:02] brother has

[55:19] he said well he said I tell the
[55:21] congregation that I need so much bored
[55:23] feet and I need so many bamboo pieces
[55:25] and I need so much wood so they go up in
[55:27] the woods and get it he said all I need
[55:29] is
[55:32] Nails he said we can't afford to buy
[55:35] Nails I said how many nails would it
[55:38] take to build one
[55:40] church and he told me how many kilos
[55:42] well brother Edward said well that is
[55:46] the equivalent of
[55:47] $50 so for
[55:50] $50 you can build one church with that
[55:54] many nails so I gave him $100
[55:57] to finish number five and start number
[55:59] six so and and he is just he works with
[56:04] the tribe 6 hours away and brother
[56:06] Edward which that's the one that was the
[56:07] Bible the dean of the Bible school he
[56:10] helps him and he they the three three of
[56:14] the three of the five churches he built
[56:17] had no instruments at all so that's
[56:19] where the other three epitone uh regular
[56:22] acoustic guitars came from was three of
[56:25] them go to his to those tribal churches
[56:28] and brother Edward took them for us
[56:29] you'll see them in a minute but that's
[56:30] brother
[56:31] letho now brother letho has found favor
[56:34] with these denominational people these
[56:36] have already come in the message cuz
[56:37] they come they come from Mystery Expos
[56:39] before but he has found favor with the
[56:42] people and
[56:44] and that brother needs some support
[56:47] because he he leaves his family for 3
[56:49] months sleeps on the floor at somebody's
[56:52] house because when you bring these
[56:54] people this mystery Expo there's 60
[56:56] you're going to see him in a minute
[56:57] there's 60 denominational people 15 of
[57:00] them has already sent him a text message
[57:02] when we got back to to Manila wanting
[57:05] him to come and further what they just
[57:07] heard because see if you just took and
[57:10] did a mystery Expo and you got 15 out of
[57:13] 60 well well if you didn't go back what'
[57:15] you do right if you if you didn't go
[57:17] back if they're wanting you to come well
[57:20] see that's what his job is and he don't
[57:23] pay you know brother Joe Green gives him
[57:26] $100 a month and that's what he travels
[57:28] on but he goes back and preaches for
[57:31] these people in their churches he's done
[57:33] it for these brothers here and he's
[57:35] found a lot of favor with them over on
[57:38] the island of palan so let's keep going
[57:39] I'm sorry it may take a little while
[57:41] today but there's the these are all
[57:43] denominational preachers right here all
[57:45] these some of the other ones that come
[57:47] there were 60 denominational preachers
[57:50] seven of them were female there was 85
[57:52] total some of the other ones are sitting
[57:54] back here that's already been accepted
[57:55] to mage is they're sitting here and the
[57:58] restaurants over here where they fed
[58:00] them at all right so
[58:06] uh all right we got to that part so the
[58:08] only problem that we had and I I don't
[58:11] know how to address this but and I don't
[58:14] know how to say it where
[58:16] the well I don't care if it gets on the
[58:18] Internet or not um they
[58:22] requested because what they did is when
[58:24] they do the mystery Expo they hand at
[58:27] the end they tell them who brother
[58:28] brandom is and they hand them all a
[58:29] church AE book and say here go read the
[58:31] church AE book well they requested 60
[58:34] Church AE books from voice of God which
[58:36] has an office in the
[58:38] Philippines and they would not give them
[58:42] the church A's books unless they had a
[58:44] name and an address of where they were
[58:45] going
[58:46] to so we didn't have any church A's
[58:49] books to give this group of people
[58:50] because the voice of God wanted an
[58:53] address and a phone number of who it was
[58:54] going to and brother royel told said we
[58:56] don't know who it's going to yet you
[58:58] know I mean how I'm just saying how dumb
[59:01] is that I mean the greatest message in
[59:04] the world and you want names and phone
[59:05] numbers please people come
[59:07] on I'd pay for them to be printed
[59:11] myself but I don't know but all these
[59:14] people were they sat all day and
[59:18] listened to brother roel and myself and
[59:20] and brother Leto and never got up they
[59:23] never you know they never shook their
[59:25] head walked out I told him I you can't
[59:28] do that in the United States you can't
[59:29] get 60 message pre Preachers in the same
[59:31] room hardly in the United States without
[59:34] somebody getting up walking out you're
[59:37] sure not going to get them from 9:00 in
[59:38] the morning to 5:00 in the
[59:40] afternoon so but there is something that
[59:44] that can come from this there's tablets
[59:47] that brother roel has found a place that
[59:49] you can buy it's just a a normal tablet
[59:51] it's not like this it's a little bit
[59:53] smaller but for $50 they'll load the
[59:56] message on it and you can hand it out to
[59:58] these people and most of them have
[1:00:00] electricity so most of them can get the
[1:00:02] message and brother Joe Green I think he
[1:00:05] purchased
[1:00:07] 50 50 of them to give out one time but
[1:00:11] we didn't have enough to give they only
[1:00:13] had like 10 left to give out to this
[1:00:15] group of people so let's go
[1:00:16] ahead but remember these are
[1:00:18] denominational people that's never heard
[1:00:20] of nothing they never heard of brother
[1:00:21] brandham never heard his name never had
[1:00:23] never heard of who brother brandham was
[1:00:25] all right here and I loved it all right
[1:00:26] keep
[1:00:28] going brother Leto started it off keep
[1:00:31] going then we broke for lunch and come
[1:00:34] back everybody ate and everybody came
[1:00:36] back all right go ahead keep going so
[1:00:39] this is all now look at them they're all
[1:00:41] writing look at them they're all paying
[1:00:43] attention they're not looking off over
[1:00:45] in the cloud somewhere they're this
[1:00:47] brother right here took three pages of
[1:00:49] notes cuz I'm sitting right over there
[1:00:50] well I'm taking this picture but I sit
[1:00:52] right over there this brother and his
[1:00:53] wife took three pages of notes while he
[1:00:55] was talking so brother R starts and he
[1:00:57] talks about the Mysteries then he talks
[1:01:00] about the first coming of Jesus was in
[1:01:01] such a mystery nobody knew about it so
[1:01:04] that's how you have to start you have to
[1:01:05] show them in the Bible you can't say
[1:01:07] brother R said you have to show them in
[1:01:08] the Bible that that there's something
[1:01:11] coming right then you go to Malachi 4
[1:01:15] and then you back up from Malachi 4 to
[1:01:19] the five comings of Elijah all right so
[1:01:21] he brother royel spoke keep going on the
[1:01:23] five comings of Elijah and also the the
[1:01:26] son of man Ministry remember where
[1:01:28] Matthew says the son of man be risen
[1:01:29] again all right so he the son of man's
[1:01:32] got to come back and and you got to
[1:01:34] remember these are denominational
[1:01:36] preachers you can't say brother random
[1:01:37] said you got to keep it all in the
[1:01:39] scripture and he did an absolute
[1:01:40] wonderful job and then he started on the
[1:01:42] five comings of Elijah well he actually
[1:01:44] asked me to speak on the statute of a
[1:01:46] perfect man but I didn't feel led to do
[1:01:48] that because of that's a little bit more
[1:01:50] advanced than what they would what they
[1:01:53] would need at the moment so
[1:01:56] not taking anything CU brother roel
[1:01:58] knows knows this we sat over there and
[1:01:59] discussed it he was bringing out the fin
[1:02:02] coming of of Elijah and I just took the
[1:02:05] five comings and went a little deeper
[1:02:06] than he's ever went before as far as he
[1:02:09] never saw that that Elijah remember
[1:02:12] Elijah remember the M the ministry of
[1:02:15] Elijah was a what it was a Myster of
[1:02:17] rest Ministry of restoration right but
[1:02:20] it was also a Ministry of
[1:02:22] condemnation Elijah had to deal with
[1:02:25] what prophet
[1:02:27] Bale
[1:02:29] Jezebel and the um widow woman so
[1:02:33] Jezebel got condemnation the widow woman
[1:02:36] got restoration Elisha same thing Elisha
[1:02:40] dealt with the school of the prophets
[1:02:41] denominations I you can't say that to
[1:02:43] them though cuz you don't want you know
[1:02:45] you don't want him to I told brother
[1:02:46] royel I said you know there there's two
[1:02:47] ways of doing this you can go in there
[1:02:49] and and do like we're doing or you can
[1:02:50] go in there and say y'all are all
[1:02:51] Daughters of the you know well
[1:02:54] that would cut them off real quick so
[1:02:56] you just go into them and you show them
[1:02:58] that look Elijah the five comings of
[1:03:01] Elijah had to deal with all the same
[1:03:03] things they dealt with a school of
[1:03:04] prophets or Baal you know the prophets
[1:03:07] of baale with Elijah School of prophets
[1:03:08] with Elisha John the Baptist had to deal
[1:03:11] with what Pharisees and
[1:03:13] Sadducees the fourth coming of Elijah
[1:03:16] will have to deal with the same thing
[1:03:18] and the fifth coming of Elijah has to
[1:03:20] deal with what the Roman Catholic church
[1:03:22] and all the things that they were coming
[1:03:24] out of but same way with Elijah he had a
[1:03:28] a two women they all had two women to
[1:03:30] deal with one was Jezebel condemnation
[1:03:34] and one was this the widow woman
[1:03:37] restoration Elijah Elisha when Elisha
[1:03:40] come he had to deal with actually he
[1:03:41] dealt with the death of Jezebel all
[1:03:43] right so he still had to deal with
[1:03:45] Jezebel plus he dealt with what the
[1:03:46] shunamite woman restoration He restored
[1:03:49] her back same thing with John the
[1:03:51] Baptist John the Baptist steps out he
[1:03:53] condemns the the woman the church and
[1:03:57] then he takes birth to the new church
[1:03:59] man come bring you over into the New
[1:04:01] Testament he brought that to the new
[1:04:02] church but he had to deal with the
[1:04:04] school of prophets too which was the
[1:04:05] Pharisees and the
[1:04:07] Sadducees and then the fourth coming of
[1:04:09] Elijah the same thing happens you got a
[1:04:12] school of
[1:04:14] prophets the denomination School of
[1:04:16] prophets then you got condemnation he
[1:04:19] was condemning the denomination then the
[1:04:22] woman and then he what brought a bride
[1:04:24] out so the fourth coming of Elijah had
[1:04:26] to do the same thing fifth coming of
[1:04:28] Elijah is exactly the same thing he's
[1:04:30] dealing with the Roman Catholic Church
[1:04:32] he's dealing with the the Jews that's
[1:04:34] going to turn him down right the fifth
[1:04:36] coming of Elijah it's going to be the
[1:04:38] Jews that turn him down then he's going
[1:04:40] to call out 144,000 so you got the same
[1:04:42] pattern all the way down through there
[1:04:44] and brother roel hadn't went that deep
[1:04:46] in it he was sitting over there he's
[1:04:47] about to fall out of the chair rejoicing
[1:04:50] but but they understood more I mean they
[1:04:52] they took it then when you bring that
[1:04:54] forthcoming of Elijah in they have to
[1:04:57] see their amen and all through the whole
[1:04:59] thing that oh amen amen we know yeah
[1:05:01] that's that's good that's right and then
[1:05:03] you lay in that forthcoming of Elijah
[1:05:06] there you know so they have to either
[1:05:08] owe me or amen cuz watch what brother
[1:05:10] real said he said you amen that a minute
[1:05:11] ago yeah you amen that a minute ago all

[1:06:35] them texting and you see some of them
[1:06:36] looking and writing his name down so I I
[1:06:39] felt in my heart one thing cuz me and
[1:06:42] brother re had already been talking
[1:06:44] about this I said you know what they're
[1:06:46] going to do they're going to Google
[1:06:47] William brandham right and they're gonna
[1:06:49] get all the bad first right
[1:06:54] so yeah so I believe it was the Lord I
[1:06:57] asked brother roel I said can I speak
[1:06:59] one more time cuz it wasn't close to
[1:07:00] 5:00 so we were we were getting uh
[1:07:03] finish a little faster go ahead to the
[1:07:05] next one so I get back up and he
[1:07:07] interprets so what I do is is I say okay
[1:07:09] listen we've we've brought this we
[1:07:12] brought this person this mystery of
[1:07:14] Elijah number four we brought this to
[1:07:17] you but I want to I want to take us back
[1:07:19] 200000 years so I grabbed my pad and I
[1:07:22] told him I said now we're going to go
[1:07:25] back to 2,000 years I'm going back 2,000
[1:07:27] years and I'm going to take my iPad back
[1:07:29] with me so brother Ro he caught on to
[1:07:31] what I was going to try to do so he gets
[1:07:33] into it and so the next
[1:07:37] slide so he's see he's doing a lot of
[1:07:39] the talking now but what I done was I
[1:07:41] flipped on my iPad and I walked up and I
[1:07:43] said now I'm walking by the River Jordan
[1:07:48] cuz that's where I get good Wi-Fi
[1:07:51] service 2,000 years ago I'm walking
[1:07:54] close to the and I see this man standing
[1:07:56] out in the middle of the water and he's
[1:07:59] just preaching his heart out he ain't
[1:08:01] got on nothing but grass and he's got
[1:08:03] honey dripping off of his lips and you
[1:08:06] know he's got some wild locust in his
[1:08:08] pocket and he's preaching the Kingdom of
[1:08:10] Heaven is coming and and he just and I
[1:08:13] thought man what is that man's name it
[1:08:15] oh John the Baptist so I said I put in
[1:08:17] John the Baptist and I look I go to
[1:08:20] Wikipedia I put in John the Baptist oh
[1:08:22] he left home at 9 years old he goes into
[1:08:25] the Wilderness and I give the you know
[1:08:27] the description of John the Baptist and
[1:08:30] I go to and I said well no and I'm doing
[1:08:32] this I'm illustrating so I said now I'm
[1:08:34] scrolling down oh it says it gives me
[1:08:36] another link go to
[1:08:38] www.arise.com
[1:08:42] and ww. sad.com so I mashed that and I
[1:08:47] said
[1:08:48] oh now they say things different about
[1:08:51] John they say he's a heretic they say
[1:08:53] he's this you see what the point I'm I'm
[1:08:55] trying to
[1:08:56] make so amen so it was good and I said
[1:09:00] well now there's another man he just
[1:09:01] walked up and I'm standing here trying
[1:09:03] to get my Wi-Fi service you know and I
[1:09:06] said there's another man here he's got
[1:09:07] long hair he's got on a robe and John's
[1:09:10] pointing at him who is this
[1:09:12] guy he said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:09:15] takes away the sin of the world I
[1:09:16] thought man who is this man and somebody
[1:09:18] says well that's Jesus of Nazareth so I
[1:09:19] said well punch in Jesus of Nazareth
[1:09:21] Wikipedia you know Jesus of Nazareth and
[1:09:24] says he's a good man was born under a
[1:09:26] little shady condition and I go through
[1:09:27] his life you know what Wikipedia would
[1:09:29] say about him then I go man it says go
[1:09:31] to ph.com again so on mash.com and it
[1:09:35] says this man's be elub this man's a
[1:09:39] devil this man's a disruptor this man's
[1:09:41] of this and that and the other you
[1:09:43] understand what I'm saying so I told him
[1:09:45] I said so when you punch in William
[1:09:47] brandom's name I said you just remember
[1:09:49] what I said because you're going to get
[1:09:51] all the bad but you know what if people
[1:09:53] were standing there John the Baptist
[1:09:55] would not win he would not be the Rotary
[1:09:57] Club
[1:09:58] president neither would Jesus I said so
[1:10:01] you take that with a grain of salt and I
[1:10:03] said you let God speak to your heart
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:10] so but you remember now two these people
[1:10:15] now there's 15 of them keep going just
[1:10:17] keep going on through we're not going to
[1:10:19] get faint brother Leto is up at the end
[1:10:20] and he said okay if you actually I gave
[1:10:22] them my website our website here so they
[1:10:25] may be keying on to our website too and
[1:10:27] looking at some things which is fine
[1:10:28] with me I don't care brother roel didn't
[1:10:29] mind but brother letho tells him said
[1:10:32] look here's my phone number if you want
[1:10:34] any more information text me 15 people
[1:10:37] text him before we got back to
[1:10:40] Manila wanting him to preach and one of
[1:10:42] them was a woman preacher wanting him to
[1:10:44] preach in a church so see the work just
[1:10:46] begins when you get them 15 people
[1:10:48] somebody's got to go back over there and
[1:10:52] pretty much live with them people for a
[1:10:54] month or to to try to get them
[1:10:56] established in the present day truth
[1:10:59] that's why I was reading that about
[1:11:00] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ cuz they continued remember
[1:11:03] we read the scripture they continued in
[1:11:05] the apostles Doctrine all right so
[1:11:07] that's what you got to do you can't just
[1:11:08] go over there and have a mystery Expo
[1:11:10] and say man we had 60 people and we had
[1:11:12] a good time and we left you did not do
[1:11:15] any good at all you actually did worse
[1:11:19] than if You' have never been there
[1:11:20] before right so brother Leto is the one
[1:11:23] that goes back over there
[1:11:25] in another week or two or probably now
[1:11:28] goes back over there and he lives with
[1:11:31] these people not literally but you what
[1:11:33] you understand what I mean goes into the
[1:11:34] church starts preaching water a baptism
[1:11:36] starts preaching one God starts
[1:11:38] preaching you know the how to receive
[1:11:40] the Holy Ghost really and how to get
[1:11:41] baptized so that that's the hinge point
[1:11:44] of the whole thing is to get somebody
[1:11:46] over there excuse me to bring that keep
[1:11:50] going so this is getting toward the end
[1:11:52] of the meeting all right and there
[1:11:55] they're all enjoying it we we prayed for
[1:11:57] this little boy he's got a a knot right
[1:11:59] there on his neck and we I don't know
[1:12:01] what happened I'll try to find out later
[1:12:03] but we had prayer for him he wanted us
[1:12:05] to pray for him so we did and um we'll
[1:12:08] see how the Lord I believe it was I
[1:12:10] believe it was healed he had to go the
[1:12:12] next day he had a knot right here on his
[1:12:14] neck and it was bothering him go
[1:12:15] ahead so then we had prayer and uh and
[1:12:19] got ready to dismiss keep going there's
[1:12:22] him right there all right now we come
[1:12:26] back to the motel this is when we get
[1:12:27] ready to leave brother Leto brother
[1:12:30] Edward and brother Dany now brother
[1:12:33] Danny's the one we've been talking about
[1:12:34] this guy didn't leave our site since we
[1:12:37] got on the island cuz he was a
[1:12:39] denominational preacher he was also a
[1:12:42] gang member for the mafia tattoos and
[1:12:44] everything on his arm he was he was a
[1:12:46] strong man with the mafia cuz they have
[1:12:48] him over there and you have to go pay
[1:12:50] money you have to pay them protection
[1:12:52] money so he was collecting the money and
[1:12:55] somehow God struck that man down one day
[1:12:58] and he became a denominational preacher
[1:12:59] then he came to one of the Expos before
[1:13:02] and really didn't understand but buddy
[1:13:05] we laid the water baptism on him for
[1:13:08] about 3 days and he didn't leave our
[1:13:09] sight so there's one that's the electric
[1:13:12] guitar there that's going to to brother
[1:13:14] Nelson and these are the three this
[1:13:17] brother put them on a motorcycle put
[1:13:20] these three not that one but the three
[1:13:22] acoustic he strapped them to a
[1:13:23] motorcycle and took them 6
[1:13:27] hours to those trouble people we can't
[1:13:31] come to church 15
[1:13:33] miles I'm going to tell you something
[1:13:35] people you going to give a count on the
[1:13:37] day of judgment that's right cuz you see
[1:13:41] what that 6 hours on a motorcycle
[1:13:42] strapping three guitars
[1:13:45] on just to get them to the people so
[1:13:48] they can just have one instrument to
[1:13:50] worship with one instrument so anyway
[1:13:52] all right go ahead so the next day
[1:13:58] 238 this is the Pacific Ocean this is
[1:14:01] right behind one of the pastor's
[1:14:03] houses all right keep
[1:14:05] going this is that's me of course and
[1:14:08] brother Danny is right there and brother
[1:14:10] Johnny he'd been witnessing to him the
[1:14:13] whole three days when he'd leave us and
[1:14:15] go eat or something he'd talk he'd call
[1:14:17] his buddy and talk to him so his buddy
[1:14:19] and him and the two sisters the two
[1:14:21] wives were baptized so we took them out
[1:14:24] and brother dick that's like the flats
[1:14:26] out in U Port St Joe you can walk all
[1:14:29] see that dot right there that's almost
[1:14:31] how far you can walk and it's not much
[1:14:33] above your knees well I told him I said
[1:14:34] look y'all are little people if I can
[1:14:36] find a hole we going to baptize so we
[1:14:39] got out about right here and brother
[1:14:41] roel said you can't go any further cuz I
[1:14:43] can't get a picture of you I can't hear
[1:14:45] you and I remember back when we were at
[1:14:49] P St Joe stingrays would get to a place
[1:14:52] and they would wallow a hole out brother
[1:14:54] dick knows what I'm talking about we
[1:14:55] found one right there and it was just
[1:14:58] big enough for me to stand in and for
[1:14:59] them to stand in keep going you'll see
[1:15:02] right there that's as far deep as it'll
[1:15:03] go everything else was higher cuz you
[1:15:05] see all the all the um um debris and
[1:15:08] stuff out here we found one hole and I
[1:15:11] told him I said I'm going to get you in
[1:15:13] the water and you don't fight I'm just
[1:15:14] going to put you down in the water and
[1:15:15] you call your name cuz I didn't know all
[1:15:17] of them's name at that time but brother
[1:15:20] Royale said it sounded like he could
[1:15:21] hear every word I said now he baptized
[1:15:23] the same way you do the same way we do
[1:15:25] same identical way to fulfill the Great
[1:15:28] Commission that the Lord Jesus told us
[1:15:30] to go into all the world preach the
[1:15:31] gospel baptize the name of the father
[1:15:33] Son and Holy Ghost I now baptize thee my
[1:15:35] sister and brother in the name of the
[1:15:37] Lord Jesus Christ so that's what we did
[1:15:40] but we were a 100 yards out in there and
[1:15:43] brother roel said it sounded like a
[1:15:44] megaphone of course my voice is pretty
[1:15:46] loud anyway but um there was boats going
[1:15:49] here there's a boat over there but he
[1:15:52] said he could hear it just as clear and
[1:15:53] we baptized them in the name of Jesus
[1:15:55] Christ and there they are right
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:04] there now the story behind this is this
[1:16:06] brother they're all these These are now
[1:16:08] the they're pastors preachers and
[1:16:11] pastors this is their
[1:16:14] wives they have had they had one baby
[1:16:16] that was born without a rectum and they
[1:16:19] when during the operation the baby died
[1:16:22] so then she became pregnant again in
[1:16:24] four months months into the pregnancy
[1:16:26] she lost a child so they were praying
[1:16:28] for a baby so they asked me to pray for
[1:16:30] them so we prayed that they would have a
[1:16:32] child and I told him I said when you I
[1:16:34] said when it's a boy name it
[1:16:37] Samuel cuz Samuel was a gift from God in
[1:16:39] the Bible I wasn't especially for for us
[1:16:42] I was saying you know you name it Samuel
[1:16:43] cuz it's going to be a gift from God so
[1:16:45] they said that's fine I told him I said
[1:16:47] look you just enjoy yourself have fun
[1:16:48] don't even worry about it you know just
[1:16:50] be husband and wife so we'll see how
[1:16:52] that goes but keep going to the next one
[1:16:55] this is Brother Rudy
[1:16:59] limato that's the only guy that was
[1:17:01] taller than me in the whole
[1:17:03] island but what's what's kind of funny
[1:17:05] is brother Rudy's about my size well see
[1:17:08] my clothes were wet and I wasn't going
[1:17:10] to wear them back on the plane so I gave
[1:17:11] him all my clothes he's the only one
[1:17:12] that could wear it cuz the rest of them
[1:17:14] couldn't wear my clothes they were so
[1:17:15] little so I left my clothes with him and
[1:17:19] uh he's got a pair of khaki pants and a
[1:17:21] spoken word t-shirt
[1:17:24] and I lost a pair of shoes somewhere I
[1:17:26] guess I gave them to him too I don't

[1:23:00] please people that ain't life life is
[1:23:03] getting somebody saved baptized and and
[1:23:05] raised up in the message you know so
[1:23:08] that God can use them that was my whole
[1:23:10] theme is how God can use you this was
[1:23:12] all the ministers this was after the
[1:23:13] night service they had all this all the
[1:23:16] way over to here and this is the most of
[1:23:18] the ministers that were at the meeting
[1:23:22] so that was after the night service all
[1:23:24] right keep going
[1:23:25] that's brother roel and sister Cynthia
[1:23:27] you've seen both of them they've both
[1:23:29] been here more of the deacons and the
[1:23:33] preachers more of the people eating
[1:23:36] eating and eating and
[1:23:38] eating this girl this sister right here
[1:23:41] was at brother Dennis's church and she
[1:23:43] played a mean mean set of drums she was
[1:23:47] a drum player so I told her I'd take her
[1:23:49] picture and show the people in America
[1:23:51] that they do have women drum players in
[1:23:54] the phili pH so that's her sister all
[1:23:56] right so we rested that evening we got
[1:24:00] finished the next day this was the day
[1:24:02] before I left we go to TM Island T oh
[1:24:07] wait a minute before we finish I met at
[1:24:11] brother Ro's church I noticed two
[1:24:13] brothers were were
[1:24:15] amening kind of quick sitting in the in
[1:24:20] the sanctuary at brother Royal's the
[1:24:22] morning service and they came up to me
[1:24:25] afterwards and anyway make a long story
[1:24:26] short they they live about two hours
[1:24:29] from any message church so they are
[1:24:31] probably right now live
[1:24:35] streaming so we got a church in the
[1:24:37] Philippines but no they listen to us
[1:24:39] every service he knew exact they knew
[1:24:41] what I was talking about they already
[1:24:43] heard it so they you know they were amen
[1:24:44] and so I didn't know that they were
[1:24:46] doing that but uh uh if you're watching

[1:26:28] brother all the brothers had to
[1:26:30] congregate into the middle of the boat
[1:26:31] because the rain was coming in these
[1:26:33] sides and they were trying to put tarps
[1:26:34] up but some of them were getting wet and
[1:26:37] brother roel he said I don't want to get
[1:26:40] wet he said we going to get wet well see
[1:26:41] I didn't know when we landed that the
[1:26:43] church is a quarter of a mile walk
[1:26:45] there's no cars you got to walk a
[1:26:47] quarter of a mile to get to the church I
[1:26:49] didn't know that he said we're going to
[1:26:51] get wet he said I don't want to get wet
[1:26:53] so they go back to talking well about
[1:26:54] right here um he um I told him he he
[1:26:58] said why are you quiet I said there's
[1:27:00] two things I'm quiet I'm either thinking
[1:27:01] or
[1:27:02] praying so I told Lord I said Lord
[1:27:05] according to what I've been preaching on
[1:27:06] this
[1:27:07] island I'm going to say Thank You Lord
[1:27:09] to you stop it rain two minutes later it
[1:27:12] stop
[1:27:16] raining sun came out it never rained
[1:27:19] another drop and you know they didn't
[1:27:21] even realize it till I got up to the
[1:27:23] church and I told them at the church I
[1:27:24] said did you notice it quit raining and
[1:27:27] brother roel said yeah it quit raining
[1:27:28] it didn't rain no more I said yeah you
[1:27:31] asked me what I was quiet about I said I
[1:27:32] was praying I said Lord I'm going to say
[1:27:34] Thank You Lord until you stop that rain
[1:27:36] and 2 minutes later done didn't rain
[1:27:39] another drop so anyway go
[1:27:41] back but this brother this is us going
[1:27:44] back so you can see we're not wet but
[1:27:47] brother his name is brother
[1:27:50] Ben and he's brother Joe Green is
[1:27:53] helping them finish their Church go
[1:27:57] back there's a downstairs right here
[1:28:00] that you walk down this little brother
[1:28:02] was it's kind of funny brother roel was
[1:28:05] going to interpret but uh brother Gino
[1:28:07] was with us and he said well I want him
[1:28:08] to learn so he he told me he said if
[1:28:11] you'd have preached 10 more minutes he
[1:28:12] said I'd have
[1:28:14] fainted cuz he was getting he was so
[1:28:17] nervous but anyway he did a good job but
[1:28:18] anyway down here is the the the
[1:28:20] restrooms and the little place for um
[1:28:24] um kind of a fellowship hall and brother
[1:28:26] Joe Green has given $400 to finish that
[1:28:30] and so brother Joe Green was at this
[1:28:31] church here and the wood up here some of
[1:28:33] it's falling down so it needs a little
[1:28:35] bit of repair but they're okay I mean it
[1:28:37] was a Monday and they still had 30 or 40
[1:28:39] people there so um we thank God for that
[1:28:42] but now you can go forward back the
[1:28:44] other way we're getting ready to leave
[1:28:46] that's some of the deacons and then
[1:28:47] that's us going aheading back to uh to
[1:28:50] the port where we got off this thing
[1:28:51] right here in Christine whe call that in
[1:28:55] tallo it's some word but in English it
[1:28:58] means dumb
[1:29:00] fish or stupid fish cuz what happens is
[1:29:03] the fish go in into this trap and they
[1:29:05] get in this circle and they can't get
[1:29:07] back out so instead of them catching
[1:29:09] them or netting them they just go in
[1:29:10] there and scoop them up inside that
[1:29:12] little thing it's made like a almost
[1:29:15] like a maze well when the fish get in
[1:29:17] there they can't Circle and go back out
[1:29:18] the way they came so they just harvest
[1:29:20] the fish cuz they eat a lot of fish over
[1:29:22] there but we didn't I didn't e any of
[1:29:25] them that's the one where they bought me
[1:29:26] the McDonald's over here in a little
[1:29:28] town they bought McDonald's and we
[1:29:29] hauled it over there cuz brother Joe
[1:29:31] Green ate some of the fish and got set
[1:29:35] from that island but uh I thank God that
[1:29:39] that people like brother Joe Green and
[1:29:40] him you know shares that information and
[1:29:43] brother do shares the information of of
[1:29:45] things to do and not to do so we make it
[1:29:46] back over to the island so now we are uh
[1:29:50] we're finished with a trip go ahead to
[1:29:53] the last we come out here that's where
[1:29:55] we leave from and we're heading back
[1:29:57] home that's the pastor right there
[1:29:59] brother Ben all right keep going and we
[1:30:03] start back we're back at the same
[1:30:05] restaurant we were at when we started
[1:30:07] and that's all of us saying our goodbyes
[1:30:10] and and uh get ready to fly out flight
[1:30:12] was
[1:30:14] wonderful ready to get back home like I
[1:30:16] said I slept a little more on the plane
[1:30:17] coming home than I did going over there
[1:30:19] I didn't sleep any going over there but
[1:30:22] uh and had good seats so uh
[1:30:25] uh it was in the bulkhead so I didn't
[1:30:26] have to share my knees with anybody else
[1:30:30] but these brothers are all good Brothers
[1:30:32] they're just they're wonderful they they
[1:30:34] are um very Mission
[1:30:37] oriented um brother Royal is really
[1:30:40] happy that Christine and Luis are here
[1:30:42] because we're you know this church is
[1:30:43] more minded toward Mission work and uh
[1:30:47] he's very proud of them and then they're
[1:30:49] proud of all of us from all the uhu all
[1:30:52] the reports we got back if read that
[1:30:54] report from brother bernon that it was
[1:30:56] all a good report that you know I didn't
[1:30:59] go over there to forward me or you it's
[1:31:03] the message of the hour that we we got
[1:31:05] to grow like I said every church I told
[1:31:08] him I said look God's got to come back
[1:31:10] for a mature bride he wants somebody
[1:31:12] that can speak the word and he'll back
[1:31:15] it up but not just to be a bunch of
[1:31:16] babies and cry about it all the time you
[1:31:18] know so if I hurt feelings and IA but I
[1:31:21] think I presented it in a way I think
[1:31:22] the Lord was in the whole thing so so I
[1:31:24] thank you and I thank the rest of the uh
[1:31:27] I thank them if they're
[1:31:28] watching which they said they were some
[1:31:30] of them would be and some of them
[1:31:32] probably later on but uh we had several
[1:31:35] things that happened that were
[1:31:36] Supernatural the the I believe that van
[1:31:38] was was uh um on its last leg and uh it
[1:31:44] made it 4 hours up and four hours back
[1:31:46] so we yeah we had to put a little water
[1:31:48] in it but it still made it and uh the
[1:31:53] then we had the uh the mystery Expo was
[1:31:57] another highlight the um um the water
[1:32:01] baptism in the Pacific Ocean I really
[1:32:03] enjoyed that that was a brother Royale
[1:32:05] said he was tired and he didn't want to
[1:32:06] do it he wanted me to do it so I thank
[1:32:08] God that he uh I mean he could have done
[1:32:10] it itself they were his people but he
[1:32:12] asked me what I do it and I said
[1:32:13] absolutely don't ever give up an
[1:32:15] opportunity to baptize anybody but uh
[1:32:18] that was a that was a a highlight plus
[1:32:21] the uh uh I you know
[1:32:25] you have to have you have to have we're
[1:32:26] all human beings you have to have little
[1:32:28] things that you think well God is this
[1:32:29] what I'm supposed to be doing am I
[1:32:31] supposed to be here is this what I'm
[1:32:32] supposed to be doing and then that's
[1:32:34] what I I asked him there at the at the
[1:32:37] um going across that water I said Lord I
[1:32:39] said according to what I've been
[1:32:41] preaching I'm going to say Thank You
[1:32:42] Lord until the rain stops and it wasn't
[1:32:43] but 2 minutes and it didn't just you
[1:32:45] know quit it just it stopped stopped
[1:32:48] raining and it never rained another drop
[1:32:51] and we couldn't see the island I mean
[1:32:52] brother Royale said we're going to get
[1:32:54] wet I didn't know you had to walk a
[1:32:56] quarter of a mile up the hill to the
[1:32:58] church but um but God honors our
[1:33:03] prayer and if you're in the will of God
[1:33:05] you know what he's going to have to
[1:33:07] that's right he has to so all of you
[1:33:11] that have that have done uh that have
[1:33:14] labored all you that work we all
[1:33:17] work but I mean physically worked to pay
[1:33:21] your tithe and to pay your offering and
[1:33:23] to pay the
[1:33:24] special um um offering that you gave us
[1:33:28] and and all of us you know brother
[1:33:29] Louise and any of us that that have a
[1:33:32] desire to go it's like brother Joe
[1:33:35] Green's father said if you can't go send
[1:33:38] somebody right amen if you can't go send
[1:33:41] somebody but I covet your prayers I know
[1:33:43] brother Al brother I mean sister Anna
[1:33:45] said brother Al and I knew he told me he
[1:33:47] said I prayed for you every day he said
[1:33:49] I prayed for you every day and I know
[1:33:50] you prayed for us we had a wonderful
[1:33:53] trip back home and like tell you ain't
[1:33:55] no place like home ain't no place like
[1:33:58] home but some of these needs that we
[1:34:00] have you know we met a lot of them but
[1:34:03] that brother Edward I forgot to tell you
[1:34:05] brother Edward when he brings his um
[1:34:09] goes to his church he has to bring the
[1:34:10] generator but they have no sound system
[1:34:13] they just have a regular guitar and a
[1:34:15] sound system will run you about 60 bucks
[1:34:17] so we're going to try to I'm going to
[1:34:19] try to send that $60 myself to pay for
[1:34:23] for brother Edward's um sound system and
[1:34:27] if IID have known that we could have got
[1:34:28] one at that guitar place for about $40
[1:34:32] with a 25% discount but I didn't know it
[1:34:35] until then but like brother Dale said
[1:34:37] there's certain things that we're going
[1:34:38] to do if anything you want to do
[1:34:40] individually um like I said the um the
[1:34:44] brother V Diaz and brother Leo solo they
[1:34:46] need travel expenses cuz they do the leg
[1:34:49] work that the pastors can't do that
[1:34:52] pastors has to be Shepherds of their own
[1:34:53] flock but when you got somebody like
[1:34:55] brother Leto and somebody like brother
[1:34:57] ba he is a pastor of a church but he
[1:34:59] doesn't go as much but when brother Leto
[1:35:00] goes he goes for three months at a time
[1:35:03] to uh palan and um forwards the gospel
[1:35:08] and I see the results because most of
[1:35:10] the people I met on that island is there
[1:35:12] a direct result of a mystery Expo direct
[1:35:15] result they didn't hear it from this
[1:35:17] person that they actually came together
[1:35:19] to this mystery Expo the message was
[1:35:21] presented in a way that it's biblical
[1:35:24] and then telling them who brother
[1:35:26] brandham was and then let God work on
[1:35:29] both ends right you know let God work on
[1:35:32] both ends that's what I told we were
[1:35:34] talking about the the Two Sisters I
[1:35:35] baptized well when they got finished
[1:35:37] baptizing them they put their pants back
[1:35:38] on so what big deal we're not talking
[1:35:42] about that right now I thought water
[1:35:44] baptism was just a you know it was an
[1:35:46] outward expression of an inward work
[1:35:48] they started on a journey even in
[1:35:50] justification that's right amen right
[1:35:54] so so I don't that didn't bother me one
[1:35:56] bit that you know a lot of people it
[1:35:58] would bother to look and see the girl
[1:35:59] had on a pair of pants after the baptism
[1:36:01] and said well she didn't get anything
[1:36:03] well you don't see it you don't see it
[1:36:05] that's right but it's like that woman
[1:36:07] preacher it's like brother royel said he
[1:36:10] said we never told that sister Marilyn
[1:36:12] she wasn't supposed to preach she got in
[1:36:15] the message she got the Revelation and
[1:36:17] she shut herself down so you do that
[1:36:20] then you know to me to me if you tell me
[1:36:23] to do something
[1:36:24] you know I might do it a little bit but
[1:36:26] I ain't going to do it a
[1:36:28] lot but if God speaks to me and shows me
[1:36:30] in the word and then I get a revelation
[1:36:33] I ain't supposed to preach then that
[1:36:37] settles it forever and ever amen so
[1:36:40] those sisters when God reveals to them
[1:36:42] that they're they're they're not
[1:36:44] supposed to wear pants then you know
[1:36:45] what exactly right in his time you can
[1:36:48] beat them over the head all day if you
[1:36:49] want to but amen be holy ghost right
[1:36:53] that's right be their Holy Ghost right
[1:36:55] but that's what one thing of those
[1:36:56] mystery Expos showed me one thing was
[1:36:59] you can present this message without
[1:37:02] saying William brandom's name now you
[1:37:04] got to bring him up in the fourth coming
[1:37:05] of Elijah but once you bring those
[1:37:07] comings of Elijah and you put every one
[1:37:10] of them and they're just a carbon copy
[1:37:12] so four can't be different than three or
[1:37:15] five or two or one four is got to have
[1:37:18] the same characteristics and when you
[1:37:19] lay that same characteristics in there
[1:37:21] that he was you know he loved the the
[1:37:23] desert he loved the Wilderness he you
[1:37:25] know he had women problems which you
[1:37:27] know what I mean with the Jezebel and
[1:37:29] the and the shite widow woman and then
[1:37:32] here brother random comes up and has the
[1:37:33] same problems with the denominational
[1:37:35] church and then he's calling out or
[1:37:37] restoring a church out of his message
[1:37:40] then it's like I said they didn't some
[1:37:42] of them may may never see it but at
[1:37:44] least 15 of them had enough about saw
[1:37:47] enough to send the text message to
[1:37:50] brother Leto and say please would you
[1:37:51] come and tell us more about this message
[1:37:55] amen you know so it's refreshing to know
[1:37:57] that that there was 60 people that
[1:38:00] didn't know about brother brandom and I
[1:38:02] mean that in in in all honesty that you
[1:38:04] could sit there and talk to a group of
[1:38:06] people and they didn't know who William
[1:38:07] Brandon was cuz you can't do that in
[1:38:09] America you can't do it in America you
[1:38:11] can't talk you say Willam bradam or
[1:38:13] either they're going to do like I said
[1:38:14] they're going to hit the they're going
[1:38:15] to hit the Google button and 30 years
[1:38:18] ago right but I hope that that little
[1:38:21] illustration and that's the same way if
[1:38:23] you had this you know if you had this
[1:38:24] 2,000 years ago they would have
[1:38:26] lambasted John the Baptist they would
[1:38:28] have lambasted Jesus they anybody Peter
[1:38:31] James John they would have had their you
[1:38:34] know phe.com would have been
[1:38:36] full of naysayers so let's stand you
[1:38:39] know even k.com you know get bring Kus
[1:38:42] in there you know and he he wouldn't
[1:38:43] have a whole lot to say about
[1:38:46] Jesus
[1:38:50] so thank you for your patience it was
[1:38:52] really a refesh refreshing time a true
[1:38:56] refreshing of myself and to be able to
[1:39:00] meet new
[1:39:02] people oh that's right I'm sorry brother
[1:39:06] uh Vernon if you'll read your the little
[1:39:08] thing that he wrote on day seven there

[1:41:43] Pro the glory of his
[1:41:48] rightousness and wonders of his love and
[1:41:52] w of his love
[1:41:56] Anders wonderers of his
[1:42:00] love amen you love the Lord amen he's
[1:42:04] good everywhere I told them over there I
[1:42:06] said look I said we got the same
[1:42:07] problems you got same Devils you got
[1:42:10] they just got American
[1:42:11] names right I mean we all got the same
[1:42:14] basically you all got we all have the
[1:42:16] same problem right and you can send
[1:42:19] millions of dollars over there but I
[1:42:22] like the old bage teach the man how to
[1:42:25] fish teach him how to fish give them the
[1:42:28] word of God that was my prayer because
[1:42:32] Dad was a little
[1:42:34] bit restricted when he went but I was
[1:42:38] able to do three anniversaries with 70
[1:42:41] to 80 preachers in the
[1:42:43] congregation every meeting and then the
[1:42:46] ministers meeting and then the mystery
[1:42:47] Expo and you know I I'm I just be honest
[1:42:51] being a teacher I like to
[1:42:53] preach to ministers
[1:42:55] anyway cuz if you can get them to see
[1:42:57] what you're talking about they can take
[1:43:00] it to their you know I could go over
[1:43:01] there they love me over there in the
[1:43:03] Philippines but you know what about
[1:43:04] another two more weeks I'd want to come
[1:43:05] back home but they're over there that's
[1:43:08] their people amen what would Paul do
[1:43:10] Paul would go over to a place and he
[1:43:12] would be there for a month or two
[1:43:15] establish them in the present day truth
[1:43:18] and then he would move on there's no
[1:43:19] reason for him to stay there cuz he's
[1:43:21] not one of them I'm not a Filipino I'm
[1:43:24] not a Jamaican but if we can go and and
[1:43:27] Spark a little
[1:43:29] bit of the preachers and the teachers
[1:43:31] and the pastors they got good teachers
[1:43:33] over there too they got good ministers
[1:43:35] but they have to
[1:43:37] hear we all have to hear that's right so
[1:43:40] that we can understand and if you can
[1:43:42] get one or two to see it and then they
[1:43:44] carry it to their you know everybody
[1:43:46] wanted me to come preaching the church
[1:43:48] and that's wonderful that's good but if
[1:43:51] you I'd rather get 70 preachers in one
[1:43:53] building and preach to them and then let
[1:43:55] them 70 take that word not my word but
[1:43:59] take a revelation of what God's given me
[1:44:01] and take it to their 40 and 50 and 60
[1:44:04] see to me that's to me that's the 100
[1:44:06] fold the 60 fold the you know the 30f
[1:44:09] when you take it out you give it to one
[1:44:11] group of people and then let them spread
[1:44:13] it you know go to palan and and give the
[1:44:16] mystery Expo and and give brother Lio
[1:44:18] enough time and some money and and say
[1:44:20] look they're yours you go spread you go
[1:44:23] spread the gospel you're one of them you
[1:44:25] found favor with them see I may not find
[1:44:27] favor with them cuz I'm an American but
[1:44:29] he's found favor with them he's one of
[1:44:31] them so he can go brother roel has found
[1:44:33] favor with the people so he can go and
[1:44:37] he goes so much till like I said he
[1:44:38] almost wore himself out and I hope that
[1:44:41] he slows down a little bit and but he's
[1:44:44] done a good work over there enough to
[1:44:46] have somebody like brother Leo or
[1:44:47] somebody other brother brother Edward
[1:44:49] God has put those people in place to
[1:44:52] further the gospel on that island
[1:44:54] because I told him I said look I said
[1:44:56] brother Rand told us in 1956 America was
[1:44:59] finished our Revival is over we're
[1:45:03] pulling one here and one there one here
[1:45:06] I said but he didn't say that about the
[1:45:08] Philippines I said you got these islands
[1:45:10] that nobody knows about the message of
[1:45:12] the hour I said you need to get there
[1:45:15] now before the other people get there
[1:45:18] all right and forward the true Gospel of
[1:45:21] God but I I want to thank thank you
[1:45:23] again for giving me the opportunity to
[1:45:25] go it was a it was a burden that I've
[1:45:28] been wanting to do for a while and and
[1:45:31] brother Dale gave me the opportunity to
[1:45:32] go and I would love to go back but not
[1:45:36] right
[1:45:37] now but uh let's just see what God done
[1:45:42] let's pray for the ones that needed the
[1:45:43] baby let's pray for the little boy that
[1:45:45] that had the thing on his throat let's
[1:45:47] just continue to pray for the people
[1:45:48] there and pray
[1:45:50] for the preachers to forward the gospel
[1:45:53] to get the gospel out to the people and
[1:45:55] I think they're doing a good job or I
[1:45:57] wouldn't say that I think they're doing
[1:45:59] a real good job of forwarding the gospel
[1:46:02] to their people but you remember one
[1:46:04] thing for sure when you're having a bad
[1:46:05] day pull that back up and watch it right
[1:46:08] you take a man that was in a dean of a
[1:46:10] bible school he had a salary he had a
[1:46:13] house he had a church well I mean the
[1:46:16] church was there in the in the place
[1:46:18] where he was
[1:46:19] teaching and sister Gail he accepted the
[1:46:22] message told him about the message and
[1:46:24] they kicked him out right so he has no
[1:46:27] salary no place to stay nothing so he
[1:46:31] goes out here and somebody's got a piece
[1:46:32] of land he said here you here's your
[1:46:34] piece of land so he built him a house
[1:46:36] and built him a church out of nothing
[1:46:38] but
[1:46:39] bamboo and you know what he's just as
[1:46:41] happy he's probably more happy that God
[1:46:45] that's what that brother um uh mahum
[1:46:48] said he said I'm more happy now even
[1:46:51] though I've been kicked out he said
[1:46:52] because I know I'm in the truth amen he
[1:46:55] said I was in error for
[1:46:58] 45 years in the Baptist Church 45 years
[1:47:02] he was a pastor
[1:47:05] there preaching what he knew preaching
[1:47:07] what he knew but when he come to the
[1:47:09] light of the hour he said this is it
[1:47:12] this is it there's nothing else like it
[1:47:14] this is it let's bow our heads dear
