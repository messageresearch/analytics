Genesis chapter 37 and then we'll read from Genesis chapter 41 just see where the Lord leads us tonight the reason really what got me on this text was um you just get emotional you kind of start thinking about where the Lord's brought you from the journey that he's taking you own and and all the kind of hard things that have have happened in your life are kind of things that take place and so come on now but I want to take a little topic tonight of the takes of a perfect man because we know that brother Brian preached the statute of perfect man and all the sermons after that and really the whole message is to get us to a place where we're not just little babies wandering around wondering what we're here for then we have a knowledge of what the day in the hour that we're living in that we have understanding of what we're doing here that our purpose and then we're not just tossed around by every wind of doctrine and you know you just think about where you've come how you've come through you've seen all the strange doctrines and all the different things going around but yet God has kept you straight in the straight and narrow and begin to open up the word to you you know my we we've got a lot to be thankful for so let me take off my coat here let's read from Genesis chapter 37 verses 1 to 4 and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably under him now let's kind of go over to Genesis chapter 41 because we got about how he he was given a coat a robe and turned to verse 38 and and read to 42 and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man and whom the Spirit of God is and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God hath showed the all this there's none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shall be over my house and according unto that word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than now and Figaro said unto Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and favorite took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him investors of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck let's go to the Lord in prayer well God was so thankful today Lord Jesus to be a Christian Lord God we're so grateful to you to be able to gather together amongst fellow believers Lord Jesus that we're all growing in grace Lord Jesus toward us this finality to come to an adoption Lord where you look at us Lord Jesus and you say that man or that woman looks acts exhibits the exact same traits that I do and I'll set him up I'll put him on a crown I put him on a throne put a crown on him robe and give him a signet on his hand and set him on rulership God was so grateful Lord Jesus to have heard this message of this day Lord God to give us to give us this kind of faith this kind of a message Lord granted I pray Lord it tonight Lord Jesus won't just be it like any other church service Lord because I don't believe that tonight Lord we've come just to learn about things Lord but we've come to receive overcoming power and Lord we've heard a message we received a message to give us that Lord God grant that Lord Jesus said you'll open up ever as we open up the doors of our heart Lord Jesus that you'll feel welcome here Lord God that you'll come and abide with us and worship with us Lord Jesus but truly you've given us something to worship we Lord God to worship You Lord Jesus we ask your blessing upon the reading of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know the first time I preached I forgot to tell everybody be seated we were coming up the road and we were talking about Monica was just tearing this story of this missionary named David Livingstone that the first time he preached he uh he he got so scared got so nervous he couldn't even finish the reading of the scripture and he ran off and just about destroyed his reputation but uh anyway you know God God takes us through trials and through through different things and everything and and and he's leaving us alone so what I want to talk about tonight is a perfect man and it you know to to get perfection it there's all these different little milestones along the road to perfection and and you know you think a perfectionist is really like climbing a mountain and you know what the Peter talked about how they accept accept you have these virtues you cannot see afar off you cannot see you cannot even really know what's going on unless you get climb up this mountain so you know brother Joe back there he's got this idea that that me and him and and maybe our kids when we go out with some time we can we'll go up hike Pikes Peak and climb up the mountain climb up this big high mountain that's in the I guess it's the highest in the east east eastern side of the high somewhere it's a big mountain and so you know when you begin to look at climbing the mountain you you begin to look at what's what's involved in that it's not something that you just go especially in this case you get up high and there's all the way to the top and there's less oxygen a whole lot less oxygen that there is down at the bottom and there's you know a lot of people especially the elderly and whatnot they get up to the top and they you know get fainting spells and headaches and start feeling miserable and all that kind of stuff so you don't want to approach it lightly you want to do your research you want to do your reading and make sure that you're prepared for that for the journey and you know brother Branham talked about how when you go when you start this journey this journey up up the statue of a perfect man what you need to do is you need to get a guide first because I like on a hunting trip or any kind of excursion like this where you you're not it's a place a way that you've never been before then you don't know where you're going you need somebody to be able to guide you and so you need you need the right equipment in other words and so they start on this to start on this journey you need to be equipped with the thing that will carry you through so I want to maybe kind of backtrack a little bit listen let's look backwards and remember how you were first born again and remember all the the challenges of all the struggles and things of you know you'd hear a preacher talking about anointed ones and maybe within your heart you would begin to question and mine anointed one do I have the real genuine thing the real genuine article and then you begin to dig deeper and find out what it really means to be a born-again Christian maybe tonight some of you were sitting here wondering if you were a real born-again Christian I you know it's kind of difficult to say things like that to put that out there but but brother Branham told us the truth of the message the truth of the gospel is that there is a mixed multitude and every assembly there's a true believer them believer in the unbeliever and you got all that that you're preaching to so maybe tonight something that there is say it might go out to your heart and you might kind of prick you and make you come to a realization that something's maybe something's not quite right and you know the the kind of the cornerstone or the central part the pivotal scripture of the whole Bible is Hebrews 4:12 that says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and you know we can feel that any Christian that's been in church for long enough knows knows how how painful the Word of God can be sometimes as it strikes and begins to shape in that masterpiece off knocking the little pieces off that shouldn't be there that sword is striking and and what's it doing what it's doing is is its revealing what's really there because without their Scripture and and the Prophet to explain to us how would we know the difference between an anointed one and someone that's really got a word birth because it says now listen to this piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit that there's a difference between the soul and the spirit there's a difference between those two you are you were made up of three different pieces you've got a body and a spirit and a soul and so the Word of God when it's preached it can discern it is a it says and of the joints and marrow the body and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so in the world of God goes out and his priests preach from behind the pool pour that's that's why I believe that the preaching of the gospel is really the highest form of worship because the preaching of the gospel bursts people into the kingdom it causes lives to be changed it gives overcoming power it causes the sinner to realize that they're lost and then it gives them life so when the word of God goes out and it begins to it begins to have an effect on the individual and to really understand what kind of effect that has on the individual you have to take let's take a deeper look at what the individual is made of because you know we we go around and we we you know when we're driving a car we put our hands on the steering wheel and we turn to the left right and and we're thinking about where we're gonna go we're reasoning at work when I sit down at work and we have these meetings and things and and we talk about what the best thing to do whether to buy some software or not how to implement it how where to put the databases where to do all the different things and we're reasoning things and so you you begin to think just as a natural human being that that is where that is where the majority of your of your essence is that the majority of your your being is but that's not really the case your being is like an iceberg we're down under the water under the depths there most of the iceberg is that's the soul of the man the soul of the beans and that soul is wherever that soul leans that's the way that that man is going to go you know I began to read just kind of see what what psychologists have to say about the subconscious and the conscious and they say man if you if you look at if you hook a man up to electrodes and things they begin to see that the man he spends the majority of his time the majority of his thinking 95% of his of his of his existence is in that subconscious room something where you're not even aware of it when you're going about your daily tasks but yet that thing that you're not aware of that thing that's underneath the current underneath the water you so to speak is what's moving you what's driving you and that's that's what you know so many Christians today they sit in churches and they and they hear the gospel and they and they just kind of sit there and they're not feeding on it there they're just occupying a chair warming the chair that they're sitting in and they think that they're saved when really there's an anointing on them they feel good that get in the atmosphere they like the music they're like hearing a firey sermon they like hearing somebody jump up and down or it's watching this they like being in an atmosphere but yet there's something that's lacking in their soul and so when you see you've got to be equipped you got to be equipped with the right thing and I'm talking about you got to be equipped by a word birth when you hear the word it goes down into that heart that listen the only get your soles straighten up the oh there's only one way one Avenue to get that soul right and it's not by jumping up and down it's not even really it's not going by going through prayer lines it's not by by so much as people laying the hands on you or or getting real emotional but the only way to get faith faith that will change your soul is by the hearing of the word by the hearing of the gospel and I'm not talking about just just like learning like you're in school and whatnot but when you when you hear over the pulpit when you hear it preached that that Jesus Christ died for your sins that he paid it away that he paid the price for all of your iniquity all of you everything has already been paid for and you sit there and believe it and receive it when you hear that that if you want the new birth repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it what his name is as Jesus Christ that name that was a mystery all down through the ages and is now revealed to you is now made plain and you sit and receive that into your soul it will change you it will change you and when you when you're conscious and your subconscious gets lined up with the world of God something's got to happen now I know maybe that's that maybe that's a little bit basic and everything maybe you say well we know how to get a new birth and everything but see this little principle that the subconscious in agreement with the conscious in agreement with God's Word will change your body see it will change your body as you feast upon the Word of God it is changing you from from from mortal to immortality of course now as we get into this you don't think I've gotten away from my my topic Joseph because as you get into this as you start going down this journey you might be like Joseph and looking around at all the circumstances thinking nothing's going on it looks like I'm in prison I'm in prison chains everything around me looks like nothing like nothing's happening but something's taking place sometimes you got to go through the sorrow and the pain and all the troubles and everything to get out on the other side and let me tell you when you come out the other side you talk about rejoicing when you come out when there's sorrow when a child is being born with but when the baby's comes forth all that's forgotten well one day we'll forget all the sorrow or like like Abraham did when he sat down with Melchizedek and he ate bread and wine after the battle was over after the battle and after the battles over we'll sit well around the circumference of the earth with Jesus and eat that communion with him because the battle will be over the battle will be conquered Nevada will be won sometimes it looks like nothing's taking place listen let's just dwell on this for a little bit about that subconscious and the cut and the cautious because that's that's so many people's problems today is a you know you think you'll think that that because you are around other believers that because you sit in a message church that you've reasoned it out and you you reason in your mind it seems reasonable it seems reasonable to do that to go to church and all these kind of things but but it's got to drop down a little deeper let's let's read number two the inside man see what the Prophet said about this he said why jesus said have faith in God is that right for verily verily I say unto you if you not if I if you shall say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt it it'll be it has to it has to do just what you say if you didn't doubt it now you believe it up here we're in your reasoning and your memory faculty and all that all that conscious level now let's get this subconscious believing it to and when the subconscious and this conscious in harmony with God then it'll happen so there's there's the nth Wow when I pray when I seek out for something when I'm calling out to God for my children when that gets lined up it will happen that's a listen that's that's the promise of God you we've got all these promises you know brother Graham talked about how that he gave us the immutable mutability of God that God cannot live to evidences that these promises are true that he cannot lie at the man a God that cannot lie that would promise you something and and if that man that a God that cannot lie would promise you something you got two proofs there then it's got to come to pass it cannot it can't falter a fail the promises of God are true as we read these quotes you'll find out that seeing it and you're in your conscious level in your conscious you can reason things out but down in that subconscious it doesn't reason that's a very important point it doesn't reason all it does is it just maybe very quietly says yes or no so in your conscious you're up there saying well I believe I believe I believe like brother Brennan will say people will come through the prayer line I believe that I'm going to be healed but down and that's subconscious so it would maybe hold his hand up and just say no no and now remember that message that y'all were just listening to perfect faith he said when perfect faith comes that subconscious is saying yes let's see how it seems it seems real simple but it just keeps building on up it just this is how we're going to take a body change by that subconscious being an agreement with the conscious which is an agreement with the Word of God the brother brother said this spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the Prophet are in agreement with the bride and they're all in agreement they're all saying the same thing when they're all saying the same thing something has got to happen let's read number three expectation now you say I've got faith the first thing you have to have a base for faith that's God's Word right this is the day when people have a base for all sorts of things that they believe but they don't even base it in sound sense they don't base it in anything if somebody were to ask what why do you believe such a such a thing will they just seem like a good idea but praise God we've got a Bible to base everything on and brother branham said this this is God and printed form you take God and print him that's what that's a quote print him on the pages and this is what you got so when you read this it becomes not pretty anymore but a living reality that you can base your word on you can base you can base your faith on this this is what we base our base our faith on come on Bob let's keep reading well then the man goes to school and he learns theology he reads it said God said so yes I believe that I believe that he's got a good theological education but does he really believe it he believes that here in his mind see but he's got a subconscious also and that subconscious disagrees with this because when he starts to do it he's a little bit scared it won't happen and it won't that's right oh brother and sister when perfect faith comes you won't be scared to take a body change everything will be lined up just right let's read number 4 he said in faith 1956 he said do you believe that ladies sitting right there yes had more faith than you thought you had see see she didn't in her conscious maybe she was kind of thinking I don't you know I don't feel anything I don't I don't see a pillar of fire or anything but yet something down in her subconscious was working she had faith and didn't even realize it faith it's a subconscious thing lady faith is not a mental act see is something that you subconsciously do it let's dwell on that first just a second let's roll that around faith is not a mental act you can't get faith by just by just thinking real hard or struggling real hard or trying to pray a good great big old prayer or anything or working yourself up none of that creates faith faith only comes by the word and you see that's what people struggle with so much well why should as soon as people start struggling with things that are that are caused by a problem in the subconscious what do they do they start leaving Church they start leaving the place where the word is preached over the pulpit any problems with the subconscious you need to you need to dig into that word more than ever that's when you should hang on let's keep reading it's something that you subconsciously do it people try to look to their intellects for faith when faith doesn't lay in here reasons lay here faith lays in the soul now the trouble with your foot and leg you believe that Jesus Christ make you well you do and it keeps going on talking to her about faith because faith lies is something working way down on the insider and the reason I'm kind of dwelling on this is because we've got you cannot take this journey up this mountain like I was talking about that journey that we want to take out west if we go out where Lord willing you can't go up that mountain if you're not equipped for the journey you can't take this journey up this mountain if you're not equipped make sure you're equipped before you start the journey why why is it so important to make sure you're equipped well one reason is because this journey is rough when all the persecutions set in or all the things all that all the trials and things of life listen to now is getting it's getting close to where you get you're starting to see the effects of the squeeze we're talking I was listening to people talking about in Africa how they're starting to to catalog all the churches if you're a message church you've got a phone into the government now all around the world things like this are starting to take place but before there can be a general squeeze there's got to be an individual squeeze you've got to have that individual squeeze in your life first to make sure that that you got to go through that wine press that that press where all that all the goodness is squeezed out all the fruit can be made manifest all of that stuff you've got to go through that first and two before but don't don't attempt to do that without being equipped with something on the inside that can pressurize you to withstand the things that are coming from the outside I mean you know think about all the all the ones that have have seemingly been in the message for years and years and as soon as people start posting things online believe the sign or whatever all the different things that have come up about well I don't know if the how many people fell off the bridge please come on what's that got to do with my salvation how many people fell off the bridge and just making up concoction things but yet they don't have something on the inside to pressurize themselves so they can fly high with the Eagles and so they fall apart I got I got tons of quotes here trying to see what I can look at I can kind of skip over save time we got here yeah I don't get nervous it's okay so we're talking about let me switch back to the story of Joseph here because the story of Joseph begins begins with him getting a coat of many colors and brother branham said that compare that type that was a type of that that robe that goes on the believer to prepare them for the journey those are my words prepare and prepare them for the journey but it's a type of the type of the Holy Spirit a type of the Holy the Holy Ghost what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost when the baptism of the Holy Ghost when when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul it's not just a feeling or sensation but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ down in your soul and that soul when when the revelation comes it'll produce a reaction a lot of times now the reaction might be different in different people that's what makes it so hard to express one person gets the revelation and they begin to cry and weep one person who gets the revelation and they begin to run around the building one person gets a revelation and they just begin to throw up their hands and rejoice but it's all the same thing different it's the concept between all the different individuals is that it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and it will have a different it will have it will cause emotions cause different things and different people different ones but the constant is that it's a revelation and so Joseph will say he got a revelation of who Jesus Christ was he got it from his father because the father is the one that gave him that Road when he compared him for the journey of course Joseph didn't know he wasn't quite aware that he was fixing the girl on a journey but you see quickly as soon as he begins to go on this journey he gets thrown into a pit I wanted to get thrown in a pit because of the revelation he had that's the same reason that that cane came through you know slew Abel the same reason that that Judas got upset with Jesus all the all down through the scripture the the ones with the true revelation have always been persecuted but I just want to kind of let's look at uh let's look at this scripture for a second Genesis 37 23 to 24 they cast him they took him and they cast him into a pit and the pit was empty and there was no water in him and Joseph being spiritually hated because of his revelation you see kind of maybe maybe step back and imagine Joseph in this situation spiritually that he's and he's now a little babe let's say let's put it over in the New Testament because we know in the Old Testament they did not have the new birth and so that God did not dwell down in their soul but over in the New Testament place him over here he's now a little babe in Christ and so you know God God did not predestinate us to remain little babies you were not where's that in the scripture Ephesians 1:5 says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will the good pleasure of his will is not for you to remain a little baby tossed around tossed about by every wind of doctrine wondering what's right wondering what's true being somebody that easily offended everything every time somebody wrongs you it just bruises you so easily but he's he's predestinated us to be called called to a higher place too hot called to a higher walk call to adoption but the path to get to that is sometimes fraught with danger and peril and all these things God God God called us to be a perfect man of course what stumbles us a lot of times is we think if I come to I can't come to church I can't get around those people because everybody there is perfect what makes us perfect it's not not the not that's trying to do it what makes us perfect is the holy God that lives inside of us because we've we've heard the word that's what makes it churches the place as a place it's the best place for the imperfect to go churches for the imperfect cuz you've got everybody starts off in perfect one time or another you start off a sinner we were born and seeing shapen in iniquity a spouse from my mother's womb speaking lies coming in the world coming in the world Rome and we needed to be made right and so you look at look at this whole journey the whole journey of Joseph typifies the journey of a believer and brother Graham said Joseph represented perfection he took talking about how you know Abraham represent election Isaac represented calling Jacob grace and then Joseph perfection and then he compared that to the to the last four Luther Wesley Pentecost and then coming up into the message of the our perfection why because the word that we've heard will make us perfect like Joseph was a perfect people with a perfect word a perfect faith that's what brother brand preached those things a statue of a perfect man with perfect faith but see God God knows exactly how to raise up children he doesn't you know Joseph he got that robe put on him by his earthly father he got the robe laid on his shoulders and and you think well maybe maybe Joseph kind of started getting in his head that now he's gonna he began to have dreams and spiritual things happening to him maybe maybe just in his natural mind he began to think well maybe I am better than these other ones maybe there's something a little makes me a little bit better and you know there is something special about the believers you're elected God has got us got his eye on you he gives you an angel when you're born but but what makes you special is not not the things that you do it's not it's not that we're better than anyone else it's the word that we've heard that makes us special and so so you see he began to maybe just just kind of dramatize a little bit maybe began to think some thoughts like that and and then God had to kind of let him go through a little a few little trials and things to press out to expose that the virtues to expose a real perfect man why because you've got to have character to reign you know brother ain't even talked about how that God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and and that picture of you that that he saw kind of like Joseph at the end of this journey he's got a picture of you that he saw and the picture of you is not of you as a little baby and as none of you as the old man it's a picture of you at the prime of your life in perfection with perfect teeth and perfect hair and perfect all everything just perfect because that's its picture of you and that's what we're walking into but now I want to stress it this part of Joseph sure nough that that the picture that was in God's mind was not of a little baby not of a little bit we got this picture of Jesus sometimes as leaving him still in the manger crying a little baby but he grew up and was a man that preached and talked and spoken and and causes the fig tree to stop bearing fruit and I did all these things walked on water as a man your journey your the end of your journey is not just to be a little baby yes see God wants us to not not crawl around on her on all for so to speak not you know suck it a little Pasi but he wants us in that the journey of the the story and that they're in a zekiel I believe this is equal 36 or 37 of the the dry bones that they began as the word began to be spoken to them they one thing led to another until finally at the end they were standing up standing up and believed in perfect faith able to walk and God doesn't want us to just crawl around wondering cry and what's going on he wants us to stand up on her own two feet you know that really the reason I began to kind of dwell on this is because you know was that he started he started school this year and when he got over there at the school he began to talk about all the a lot of the other students they had parents with them shadowing over them just kind of like in other words they didn't they couldn't stand on their own two feet they had to have their parent there to click the mouse for them and sign up for their classes and do all that kind of stuff I remember when I dropped him off for the standardized testing and everything we we're all sitting there in the car watching all the students walk in and and there was one student that had their mama with him carried in the lunch bag with him you see you see that even in the natural that looks odd that looks odd for somebody to be kind of relying on their mama to bring a lunch bag with them and walking in there going into the test none of the other students had their mama with them but their mama's going with them to make sure they get to the right place and do the right thing and all that kind of stuff now in the spiritual you say you're supposed to stand on your own two feet yeah let me get to preacher now you're supposed to be you're supposed to have your own your own relationship with Jesus Christ you're not supposed to be growling around wondering wondering you know it seems like so many today they they rely so much on the pastor or on the Deacons or on somebody else to have the relationship with God for on their behalf so that they don't have to work they don't have to go through all the trials maybe that Josephina they do they don't wanna have to endure all that stuff let somebody else go to people's houses let somebody else do all the praying let somebody else do all the struggling and everything let somebody else do all the worrying about whether there's something really going on if God's really doing something in the people's lives let somebody else do that but God wants you to stand on your own two feet on your own two feet so you know you won't be a little baby you know today today is and then even in the natural but even in the realm that's not spiritual everything's everybody's so concerned with with not being offended with not everything having everything just just right and you think think about that situation that that Joseph was in where he put that he got that road put on him and now he's in danger of being like a little delay out of seeing snowflake y'all know what a layout I see the snowflake is a layout of seeing the snowflake is where they say it snow for every snowflake is unique every single snowflake is special and so every single snowflake needs special treatment every single spray and by special treatment they mean well I've got a right to this I've got a right to do whatever I I've got a right to not be offended I've got to write in some of the Saks classes we were astounded in fact this wasn't the case when I went to school but now when you start class on the first on the very first day just so nobody is offended they ask what kind of pronoun would you like to be referred to pronoun what kind of pronoun would you like to be referred to now you know on the west coast now they're saying that there are 16 different pronouns that you have a right to be referred to and you're in your in your school or else they can take you away from your parents or just starting all this kind of stuff snowflakes snow but God is not raising us up to be a little snowflakes where we can't be touched we can't be offended well we think we've got a you don't have a single right coming you don't have a right to yourself at the end of the store we'll find out that Joseph was chained by shackles to the world he was he was willing to do sacrifice everything in his life to see the Word of God fulfilled and so that's maybe my message tinnitus you know you think you think you've got that you're put on here on earth to be a mechanic or to be a teacher or to be maybe a computer analyst or whatever but your job that's not your job or here on earth that's not your role your role is to fulfill the Word of God to see the Word of God fulfilled in your life and to see that word of God fulfilled you've got to grow into the stature of a perfect man not somebody that just feels like they need special treatment not somebody that feels like they can't have somebody disagree with them my my you think think about in this message with all the different disagreements over the years if people got so offended every time somebody disagreed with them where would we be but it's a growth process it's God bringing us into the full stature of a perfect man it's just somebody that's that has authority that has speaking conditioners somebody that grows up into the third pool and you know the third pool comes there's a lot of different things that come with the third pool you want to talk about the third pool it's the opening of the word to but it's also speaking conditions and it's also preaching to the Lost and there's a lot of things that go with that so if you want to get into the third pool you've got to get into the word that you not be tossed about by every wind of doctrine be a little baby and all those kind of things yeah you're right I do need something it's time to that's the top of the hour that's time to drink some more you know I think let me use Monica's family as an example because her she her parents raised up 13 children which is quite a feat so I kind of look sometimes look to them to see you know how they how they raised up their children when when they're a lot of Monica's brothers when they when as they began to get older they didn't that they sent them off to the bank they wouldn't go with them and like have you know had the back of their neck come on we're going to the bank they take them to the they'd sent them off to the bank you talk to the teller you do all the stuff you transfer the money you do all you do all this kind of stuff you talk on the phone you do all this guys that why because they didn't want him to beat this little sniffling layout of seeing snowflakes they wanted to be raised up so that one day they could stand on their own two feet even in the natural that's that's a goodly thing but in the spiritual that's what God wants us to be he wants us to come up to where we're not we don't have to turn run around and where's mama well or worse where's where's my spiritual daddy where well when that when the time comes when you need something do you need to go find the pastor or can you listen one day one day you might get to the place where when the doors are closed we might all be dispersed or something and you won't be able to run to a prayer line you won't be able to run and fast and pray and do all these kind of stuff because you got to be standing on your own two feet but I believe that's what the preaching of the gospel here at this church has been preparing us for maybe some time has been rough maybe it's been hard but it's preparing us to stand on our own two feet so that when the time comes maybe you can speak some food on your table for yourself maybe you can speak something to speak a condition listen it's not normal for people to go around and not be able to speak to a mountain and move it it's not normal to not be able to speak to the winds and the waves and cause it to cease when I Adam was in the Garden of Eden he could speaking and calm things that said things bring peace to the earth and that's what the normally is that's what the Word of God is bringing us back into an equilibrium where that is normal that will be normal it's not normal you say well I need to rely on somebody else to do the speaking it's about past time to rely on somebody else we need to get the plate to a place where we can stand on our own when you see to get to that place Joseph had to go through some trials they threw him in the pit what about brother Branham you have a devil on you and he went down in that cave and he said I'm staying here until I figure out what's going on and then he met an angel wouldn't would he have met the angel made probably if he hadn't gone into that cave and we've had and got squeezed a little bit you've got a devil he was wondering whether he had a devil or not I wonder tonight if maybe some of us should get serious about whether we're just an anointed one or not whether there's the work we've had a real word birth get serious and get serious with God and don't check it out and find out cuz you've got to you've got to go through those times you've got to go through those places God God will squeeze you there's got to be an individual squeeze before there's a general squeeze you see that talk about Jase Jacob wrestling with the angel listen if you have a wrestled with the angel then you don't need somebody to explain what wrestling with the angel is wrestling wrestling with the angel you know when you come into the message you begin to wonder you begin to wrestle whatever doctrine that you heard every scripture what do you mean I should be baptized like that what do you mean there's not a Trinity what do you mean all this kind of stuff and you began to wrestle it and when you wrestled you you wrestle by turning pages you open up the pages of your Bible and the patients are the message books that have been given to you and you start turning pages you get on your knees and you wrestle and you come out on the other side like like Jacob did after he wrestled with the angel you never walk the same after you've wrestled with the angel you don't walk the same anymore because you've been delivered you've come through you've come through a process where something has been birthed in you and listen the bride is coming through a process now where the son of man is birth its producing its producing the word made flesh the word and I'm not saying that's something coming I'm saying it's right here it's already here it's listen I believe that even in this church even in there is assembly there's there's ones at all different levels but there's somebody here that's it that's sitting in adoption there's somebody here there's got to be somebody here they're sitting in adoption there's somebody here that said he ever ever stains or somebody here that's just being born in maybe but listen I don't believe it's far off I don't believe we're looking for something to come way down the road I believe that the Word of God is in flesh right here right now because the scripture says it is let's let's keep reading I've got these different stages in my nose look you got a UK how could Joseph come to that throne without character if he came to that throne he would be like a lot of maybe politicians today that are in leadership positions but they have no true character and so there a lot of big talking and everything but one wrong move and a button gets pressed and a bomb gets dropped because there's no character no character but but power without character is satanic but character in power Oh oh my I think what that would be that would be somebody like Joseph where they they couldn't can even point a finger at him and find one flaw and this kind of character does not come by trying to be good this kind of character only comes by the word because this kind of character is the word made flesh this kind of character is God in you remember brother Brown talked about how that when you go beyond the curtain of time when you step over there the only thing you're going to take with you is your character now you can either take the character of this world of this legacy and age or you can take the character of God that he is he's after he's been birthed into you let's kind of let's take a step back and look at look at this this whole story of Joseph because you know ministers preach in different ways and I kind of preached from like a big landscape view I know I'm just painting a picture where or you can kind of see the whole thing and but you know you can see in the life of Joseph you can see the entire journey of Jesus Christ you can see the entire journey of a Christian and because you can see the entire journey of all the seven church ages in the life of G of Joseph because his life types out every feast all the seven feasts let me just go through that real quick old brother Bob don't get Teddy calling us cuz listen the seventh you'll know that right the seven feasts type type the journey type the whole journey of the Christian experience from Passover all the way over to the feast of tabernacles a feast of Passover and the feast of unleavened bread or typed in his when he went down into the prison and on one side of Jesus was the was one that was one thing that went into paradise on the other was one that that lost eternal life there was two theis on either side of him and just like Joseph down there and that in that prison when he got thrown into the prison for you know they light up part of his wife lied on him and said all those things all one side was the butler and on one side was the Baker and and one got restored and the other got his head cut off so let's keep going on this the next feast is the feast of firstfruits because when Joseph came out of that he it's just like Jesus being risen he came out of that out of that prison out of that thing and he and he was put into after after the Pharaoh began to talk to him and and heard about how he could interpret dreams just like how the bride today can has an understanding of the word of the hour and the day that we're living in and just like Jesus had an understanding of who he was who what the son of man was and all those things and so Jesus Jesus rose from the even on the feast of firstfruits and Joseph rose from the prison on the feast of firstfruits we'll say it like that and then and then Passover where what does what happens on the feast of Passover God he pours out his spirit and begins to call to him a bride which is the same thing that Joseph did he began to he got a Gentile bride and drew her to him and and meanwhile the feast of the trumpets begins to unfold because the features of the trumpets because to call the 144,000 back to their homeland draw them back and so that on the day of the feast of atonement they recognize who he is and recognize that he's the one that they killed and that's the same thing that played out in Joseph's life that the Jacob and all of his brethren they were turned back and they went through all the process of getting Benjamin and finally Benjamin came and then they recognized who Joseph was and then we've got the Feast of Tabernacles because after all this was done all of them came and they lived there they lived there in in the Millennium we'll say in the Millennium there they lived there and peace down in Egypt because the whole the whole life of Joseph types this process that's going on and see God has taken us through a process - and what he's doing is as you go through this journey he's got to test you to see if there's any lease will say any leaky spots to make sure that all of these virtues all of these things are packed in there real good and you can't shake the boxcar around see you see maybe when when Joseph began his journey at faith and he was given that that road you could say that was faith because he that's when you start your journey at faith the same Road maybe will say like this to say when you get a robe with Elijah Elisha got a robe it was the same robe that Elijah wore that road was given to him you get the same the same baptism of the Holy Ghost the same power see he kept on going he then he went into into Potiphar's house and the Bible says that Potiphar looked up to him and and he demonstrated virtue and strength because out of him was flowing that grace that God to him God gave him you know brother Owen said virtue was a pass for it to pass out and so there Potiphar looked on him with you know admiration where is all this coming from and he set him over the whole house so that when Potiphar's wife came to him and began to accuse him he said look I can't I can't get involved with you here your husband has set me over things that in his house that he's not even aware of because he respects me he trusts me so much and you see virtue is when somebody is when somebody looks at that life and they know that there's a real Christian living that life because it's like that it's like a locomotive that that sermon our preach to remember that worth it once the fire gets burning in the boiler and the sting is moving the virtue powers the wheels because the virtue was the power they gets the train moving it gets it moving and you keep on going then then Joseph got thrown it down into the prison and he he revealed to the baker and the butler what their dreams were and he said maybe within himself he said remember me when you go back to the to Pharaoh remember me but then he had to stay down there two more years you know brother Graham taught us patience is patience with God waiting and trusting that God is going to bring to pass it what his dream his dream was that his vision was that one day he would be sitting on that throne so he's waiting he's waiting for that to come to pass he's trusting that God will bring it to pass patiently patiently with his brother and sister patiently with God knowledge to understand what his place was that he was supposed to come to the throne because God has shown it - I wonder how many today you know wondering what what we're doing here what what the church is for what the bride is for but somebody with knowledge will have an understanding of the day in the hour that we're living in and what's taking place and then temperance doesn't fly off for I lose can't you know talk it out with somebody doesn't jump to conclusions and when Potiphar's wife began to poke and prod at him he didn't roll back he didn't accuse and all different things but you know he just something within him was able to withstand the pressure of the outside and then we get to godliness to be like God I think maybe sometimes that's a little bit confusing sometimes godliness is confusing but you know godliness and and Joseph and Joseph situation down in that prison he began to be shackled he began to realize that his purpose was to fulfill the will of God that's the purpose of every believer when you get to godliness you begin to say that I only do that which is pleasing to the Father because your yoke to that word like Jesus there in the Garden of Gethsemane when he began to he said father let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done see even in his flesh even in his groanings he it was something within me I don't want this to go through all this uh it's not something that I'm looking forward to certainly and you know many things in the Christian journey you it's not a lot of fun to go through but yet it's bringing it it's fulfilling the Word of God brother Branham had to go through all of the things of his wife pass it away and his child all those things that he tells in his life story to see God's Word made manifest in his life the Psalms 119 49 50 it says remember the word under thy servant upon which thou has caused me to hope this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word hath quickened me that's the comfort that we have in our affliction that we've heard the word and job 36 15 he said it says he delivered the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears and oppression think about that and oppression your ears become open Bob of course you're going through a squeezing time you begin to trust in God more but God has given us something to rejoice about Paul said in Ephesians 4:6 20 he said for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that there and I may speak boldly as I ought to speak you see as you climb up this mountain I believe that you become more and more yoked to God you become more and more unwilling to do anything that would be displeasing to God unwilling to do anything that would be displeasing to him that would sever that relationship you know when Jesus could say I and my father are one I and my father are one that means that there they were United I there's no there's no they he didn't want to break any kind of fellowship and you know a believer today to come to a place where you can see I and my father are one means you've got to be so yoked to the word until you're ready to go through the fire like the three of you children you're ready to go into the Lions Den like Daniel you're ready to do you're ready to die like Peter did you're ready to die like the the early Christians that they put them out on the lakes of ice and and sit there and watched over them until they died until they froze in the cold I believe this that's what we're coming to to where it doesn't matter I you know it doesn't matter what people say what people say on the internet it doesn't matter what people say well we're coming to a place where we're we're ready to speak freely about what we believe that we're ready to share these kind of mysterious things that maybe we've been holding back on all these years all down through these these last maybe 20-30 years however many it seems like maybe now people are ready to cut loose and share exactly what they really believe about about the message of the hour why because we're coming to a perfect faith and we've got a perfect word to bring us to that a perfect faith and a perfect word I'm trying to close here yo I know sometimes you get a little bit technical and everything and it starts to you know so hang on they're with me but listen listen so let me let me bring him back around to where where I first started from you need to be equipped you need to be equipped with a word birth to take this journey Rob Rotman the message perfect faith he said he and the questions and answers on the seals is really where I'm talking about he he started when he began to talk about how that the mystery of the seven seals had gone from the people he began to talk about how that it wasn't for them he said you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to it but then if you keep reading out a little bit further he begins to talk about a listening post the listening post and he said now now here's a post and that's what we'll call that a listening post see and it's got radio C and there's warnings and things can be done like a sword in your hand C it can pick from the evil or pick from only as it gets this message C did you and n begins to talk about how there's 10,000 voices in the room did you know there's ten thousands of voices in this room right now see listen you start off you start off your journey getting equipped with that teacher that will teach you from the inside in other words you've got to have that equipment to be able to receive the message for your day you got to be able to you got to be able to to tune in to the radio station to get the word to get the revelation and as you keep growing up you're you're tuning into the frequency and and and you begin to hear different things I mean honestly when when the preaching of the gospel goes forth everybody in here is hearing a different message everybody's hearing something different depending on where you are what you're struggling with all the different things but you're tuning in because that receiver on the inside is giving you exactly what you need what you have need of but see listen brother Brown began to talk about how that see when you grow up you begin to grow up to a place where it's time to get this perfect faith and he began to talk about this listening post see it wasn't time back then it wasn't time it wasn't possible for you to turn in to tune in to that see you know of course some dear some some continue in and everything but I believe now is the time we're getting our frequency tuned in you know this the seals can't be open to a little baby the seals can't be open to somebody until they've until they've grown up to a place what God looks at them and says yo you've got all the virtues it's time for the headstone to come then then that capstone revelation can be revealed with that person and see listen here's another thing that's kind of interesting about the head can when they're hit whenever the head comes when the head comes to the church even when the head comes to a to your own family when a man takes headship over his family it will always cause a disturbance it always causes a disturbance when a man begins to say this whole house is mine see you this and this day a lot of times people say well the man is supposed to have a man cave and put him off to the side somewhere but God doesn't have a man cave the whole house is his he comes in and he sits down and he says it's all mine everywhere I if I want to go in the kitchen if I want to go in the in the bedroom everywhere I've got free reign of this house let's see see listen even in the natural if a man begins to start putting his foot down about in this house and Maya asks for me and my house we will serve the Lord many times it creates a disturbance and you see sometimes that you see you see you still see men that are in the kind of a little baby form and they don't they hadn't quite taken figured out how to take headship over their house you know you you can take head try to take headship in a lot of different ways but I believe that the way a Christian takes headship over their home is by the Word of God listen you can get a lot more love either you get your wife to love you a lot more by getting down on your knees and spending time with the kids opening up the word that'll get out a whole lot more love and respect out of your wife and out of your children then then a lot of other things it'll get a whole lot more respect than a Hallmark card let's say like that so what what what I was getting at is [Laughter] we're able now we're able now because we've heard the word and we've gone through all these struggles and we've gone through all these things we've come to a place now where we're able to tune in to the right frequency I believe I don't believe it's a far fish to say that we're we're at a place now where we're we can begin to tune in to the frequency of the capstone revelation we begin we can begin to to look at we don't get bored when we come to church and somebody's breaking down the seven trumpets and the seven vials and the seven seals and the seven churches and all the things that go into that because something down on the inside of us is is feeding on that we're waiting we're waiting we're longing for the transfer for something to change within us you see where we're not just coming to church just to occupy pew or sit in church just to have fun or just to be seen or just to make to network and then try to find job relationships and things like that or to get to enjoy the good coffee like many people do but we're coming to church to be to be made overcomers to be transformed by the renewing of our mind because what he's not he's not coming back for a little baby baby bride he's coming back for a mature word bride and that's what the Prophet said he would be pointing to the skies to a word born bride not a little baby not somebody that's just so easily offended so easily pricked and marred and and doesn't know what's right and what's wrong but I believe that we're coming to a place where we know listen when Joseph got that throne when you when you sit with him on that throne let me let me preach on that for a second because you know you know that story about the UH I got it right here I think I do yes I do Matthew chapter 20 when this the mother of the sons of zebedee she began to ask Jesus can my can my son sit on the right hand or to the left hand and I'm gonna just read this for a second I'm closing here hang on just for a second Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples a part of the way and said unto them this is Matthew 20 verse 17 behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the chief priests and under the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles the mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again he just got 'told telling a very sound like a very sad thing he's gonna get crucified all this kind of stuff and then right after that right after he told all the things that company he would have to drink the persecution and all this kind of stuff then then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him and he said what wilt thou she say the name grant that these two my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in that Kingdom but jesus answered and said you know not what she asked are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they they say unto Him we are able and he said unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but that she'll be it shall be given to them for whom and it's prepared of my father why did he say that it's not mine to give because listen I put it like this that seat was reserved not that there's a right hand or a left hand seat or something like that but listen you've got every down through these seven Church ages everybody has a place that's reserved for them for them a place a partial portion of the word for each of them to fulfill in their hour and your portion and this day there's someone this prove this that's that their portion their seat I'll put it like that their seat is to fulfill the adoption to fill coming to a place where you sit and authority over over what those three things were that their brother has said sin Satan and flesh to sit in authority over there you think about how when you come to Authority when you come to that throne when you come to sit with him in the Father's throne then you're in authority over those three things overseeing why because sin has been cast out sin has been cast out of your being cast out of you that God has come to take over because he gave you the equipment on your day of Pentecost he filled you with the Holy Ghost and down in your soul he began to work out and out from you all the sin all the unbelief until until you got all that lined up in your conscious your subconscious and it matches up with the Word of God and over Satan why why because when Satan looks at a man like this with perfect faith a perfect a perfect man he doesn't know what to do with it he jumps around like Potiphar's wife and pokes and prods and says well like Potiphar's wife if you read in the in the scripture she kept coming over and over well how about now how about now you know and I'm sure she you know dressed the part and and adorned herself all in all kinds of ways and kept badgering him and kept badgering him listen a man like this can't be hindered like by Satan saying Satan can't get to it brother Brahim said a man you can get you can come to the place where the devil doesn't know what to do with you because you're you come to a place of authority over sin Satan and the flesh because listen if you come to a place where you're conscious and your subconscious agrees with the Word of God where the spirit and the bride and the prophet are all in agreement your body will have to be changed your flesh will have to be changed you know the musicians could go ahead and come I'm trying to wind up here you could he gave us he's given us in this day by a perfect message by perfect word overcoming power to sit in authority to have dominion over sin Satan and the flesh to have and you can see that in the life of Joseph where Joseph started off being equipped he went through all these things when you look you look around and you're like think back to your life were you think about all the things that happen to you that we're discouraging all the things that you know I you know you think about people that I've gone through things in my life where what people would begin to ask me well if you if you've got what you say you do why don't you just speak and cast it out or whatever speaking and and bring ela you know make all these dares and all this kind of stuff all that all that stuff all those hard likes all those travails that you can look back on where to bring you into a perfect place into a perfect faith and I'm gonna stop right there you can stand with me [Music] see the mighty [Music]

wouldn't you said well why didn't you tell us about it why I'd already said I was healed I guess you're so out of breath until you this cool you know I couldn't walk couldn't do kept on saying by stripes I'm healed cuz that's the thing to do I mean I've had people to pray for me I find I stripes I'm healed you're about a week ago I had such a dizzy spell till I'm just holding on to try to get even up here to pray for you still staying by stripes I'm believing it thanking God for it because that's what we're supposed to do you that's Wade we we left one up we went to look at some deer hunting land there Monday they did Tuesday I didn't hook with it I'm gonna go with him we want my home's after my house through the woods and up and down and in and out I fell behind a little bit

don't matter how worse it gets you can't go buy them things you can't go because he had said well well why in the world would you want to go hunting when he'd run so out of breath you couldn't walk up and it's not a hard climb where we hunt they buy stripes I'm healed I wouldn't go to give in to no devil and his little flim-flam things you know try to do no just keep on going you walk right into your healing if you'll do it that's the only way that I've ever got my healing I've been healed instantly been healed a lot of thought but most of the time it's just say it won't write into it and wait for him to bring it to pass and believe it what about you one more before we go [Music] Jesus P Rama [Music] be satisfied ah let me do your loving [Music] [Applause] [Music] let it be [Music] you
