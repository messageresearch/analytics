========================================

hello everybody out there on the Internet god bless you thanks you can see windy again this morning and and of course welcome the brother/sister handers brother wait you missed it you missed out well you know wait um so I I put together just some slides on um I just to kind of compare and go through the few scriptures and clothes on law and grace you know you have to you talk to the young people about things that they're dealing with everything you kind of get you into the mindset of you know overcoming and I just to kind of give you an overview of what I want to talk about is that is that law was given to kind of expose our to to bring us to a God consciousness that God is observing us and to make us aware the the things that of the defects in our life and to make you aware that you need something because when you look into the mirror of God's Word and you begin to see that there's there there are defects in your life that you need God that there's something that there's lacking in your life then you begin to cry out for God and to look into his word for remedy and you need something you can't and there's no there's no satisfaction to the law and anything that you can do but what we the the only the only satisfaction for the law is the righteousness of God that he applies to us but by grace and he gives his grace to us based on just based upon our said I just I simply believing in him so when we believe on him he applies his grace to us and His grace works in us gives us the power to overcome the things of the world so really that's what kind of wanted to look at the two things that long versus Gration law the law was given there's a purpose to the law to take to bring us to a consciousness that there's something lacking in us but then we need the grace of God to meet the requirement of the law it's what God did for us needs to requirement he paid the price on the cross so that we wouldn't have to die we wouldn't have to there's no way for us to meet the requirement of the law he made it for us yes and when we when we believe on the atonement that he made for us and and and the purchased the purchased possession the purchase price the price being paid then he is he meets the requirement he has already met the requirement of the law so you know a lot of new Christians they begin when they begin to come to church everything and and and you know I think it's good to kind of kind of refresh on our memory of these kind of basic principles because you know you get sometimes you can get so down deep into the into the deep things of the word and everything and you forget that we're not saved by the things that we do we're not saved by the work trying to work something up within ourselves and that's what in the book of Romans chapter 3 and the whole book of Galatians that more Luther just said they spent this whole life we're really looking at the book of Galatians because the book of Galatians keeps reminding you the urine saved because that you do because of the things that you do because you have kept yourself from this from that or because you've made yourself holy because of the of your works but you know new Christians and and so for you if you kind of use you start your Christian journey with legalism you look to see like a lot of a lot of the questions that young people asked if they use Bible studies is that okay for me to do this is there okay for me to listen to this kind of music is it okay for me to listen to to do this kind of thing or whatever is it okay and you're looking at it from a barrier a legalist do's and don'ts that kind of thing but the the message the gospel is not do's and don'ts it's belief in Christ and he will do it for you move he will work he will give you overcoming power so that the faith that believing in him works outward within you and takes possession of your flesh saying Romans chapter 3 verses 9 to 10 and I know we're trying to keep the sunny lesson in just 30 minutes so I'm not going to go on for too long but we'll just kind of cover some basics and Romans chapter 3 says what then are we better than they know and Noah's he's talking about the comparison between Jews and Gentiles the Jews better than Gentiles because Jews keep keep the law I have the law all these kind of things no one knows for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin as it as it is written there is none righteous no not one there's nobody righteous by themselves by the just because they have come from particular genealogy or because they do particular work protocols in this case he's talking about circumcision because a Jew is circumcision circumcised that it doesn't make them there's no righteousness in your works in the things that you do now we know that one thing in Romans chapter 3 verses 19 to 20 continuing oh he says now we know that what things soever the law saith is safe to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and see this is where you get into the purpose of the law the purpose of the law oh thank you man we have that same problem last time I forgot our victim now we know that what things soever the law say it's made to the improver under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God there's the purpose of the law everybody's guilty and then extending suppose as your business and you know you begin to talk to some people in there and they think that when they when they become confronted with Christianity or the gospel a lot of times the reaction is the things that I'm doing are there's nothing wrong with it there's nothing why why is it wrong for me to drink alcohol or smoke a cigarette or smoke a cigar I a lot of times you know people they'll say well life is hard I need a little something that kind of help time you know I'm serious listen these are actual natural responses to things that I've talked to people about well why why should I not get a little bit of enjoyment in the way that I that be something you know like you hear people they they work all day and they go home and drink a beer and and fall asleep on the sofa and get up and do it all over again and and because life is hard and everything there's there's things they're trying to satisfy that thirst they get them with a little bit of alcohol when I smoking a cigar or something but see the law was given to make you guilty when you come to church the the mirror of God's Word exposes there's something else that you should be thirsting for and yeah you're satisfying your flesh with all these lustful cravings and all these different kind of things but there's something else that's that's you were really made to thirst after and so you begin to realize that there's a defect therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in this site for by the law is the knowledge of sin the law gives you knowledge that you're doing home and that's what my contention is the law though all should be preached it but it's going to be preached with grace you know if you don't preach the law and how does anybody know that they're singing you got you gotta preach it so that people know that there's something wrong in their lives but if you try to satisfy if you try to justify yourself by saying well well just within myself I'm gonna go to Alcoholics Anonymous and stop drinking or I'm gonna just try I'm gonna try within myself to put aside these things the government that the devil has me burdened with Europe you're very unlikely to succeed sanctification exactly because I can't step of sanctification it's that legalistic state if a man brother that's right yeah this is very dangerous to community goes you're you're in that legalistic stadium but you don't have the whole thing goes right yes sir that's why Anna's eqo chapter 16 the Bible says that I will establish my covenant with thee and thou shall know that I am the Lord that thou may ask remember and be confounded and never open our mouths anymore because of thy shame when I'm pacified toward thee of all that thou hast done said the Lord and other works when the when you become confronted with the word you realize your mouth is closed to any kind of why I didn't do nothing wrong there's no sin there's no sin in me the Bible says that anybody says I don't see him is a lie because they everybody isn't guilty before God and that's what the law does but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested in Romans chapter 3 verse 21 the righteousness of God without the law some something something beyond the law something greater than the law comes on the scene where you've been to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and he gives you his righteousness the righteousness without you trying to do something of your own self the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus now grace grace is something that you don't do anything for you can't do you can't do anything to Mary grace you don't you don't it's not like saying if I if I can if I can just be a good enough person then I'll get enough grace to allow me to overcome you know the only thing that you have to do is believe and you know we keep we keep harping on faith faith is your revelation and it comes by hearing the word so that's why we've got to come to church we've got to study study the Bible and hid in the atmosphere because II the word is what will give us faith to overcome it gives us faith to believe what God has done for us to accept what he's done for us to accept the grace that he's given to us and grace is God's gift to us to overcome the flesh things of this world the things of your carnal nature all of those kind of things so it is really almost difficult to preach law and grace because on the one hand you've got to preach law in a way that exposes the carnality of our our our nature and all those things but but yet you we've got to preach it also in a way that gives people a hope that you can't overcome yeah you know you we're not supposed to be just kind of you know accepting of the situation that we're in sometimes it seems like it's preached that it doesn't really matter what you do it doesn't really matter the condition that you're living in just go ahead and smoke those cigars and all those kind of things but that's not true either it's not a greasy grace right yeah we're not we're not living the kind of gospel will you just do whatever you see but when you accept the grace of God it will produce a change in your life it will give you overcoming power regulations the law was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ exactly that's why I lose my love no no that's that's actually that that's right along with what I'm gonna be talking about how I was gonna get to how Martin Luther just loved the book of Galatians that he actually wrote right when it is I forget the name of it but that big that big book he wrote that summarized all the deep teachings and Galatians which is really about you can't be saved by your own words so let's look at some things that that um brother Brown said he said look at it in the world today where all this is I'm rises up watch on all the cults of non mediating and a legalistic I got to do so and so if I don't speak with tongues if I don't do this if I don't shout if I don't dance there's something wrong with me that's legal if we are saved by grace through faith ez7 Jehovah Jireh then he takin yeah but now we find out after this dispensation then it lasted on that legalistic Sat dispensation until a real royal seat come then he taken all the legalism upon himself because he did all the things that we could not need he paid the price all the works he did and paid the price of redemption in God's church is back in grace again not under the law and legalism it's under grace and the promise of God the true seed of Abraham he taken the law upon himself and the law nailed him to the cross of what we must do and must not and must do and must not do it that that is Liberty to the church that you're not you don't have to go like the Catholics push the penny down the string with your nose and do all of the different novenas and fanaticism and stuff you don't have to do all of these things to be saved it's just believe it on the Lord Jesus Christ now what would we say today you got to quit smoking you got to quit drinking you got to quit doing this that wasn't what he asked he said what must I do to be saved and Paul told him say you don't have to do anything what what I do believe all the Lord Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not coming through on our congregation and standing before the church and say this and most frankly you immerse you or whatever you want to do our way and if you're not and I Church then that wasn't it he said just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved now when when Jesus will be preaching he would preach he was preaching to people that were very legalistic that's actually what the Nate that term pharisaical means if you look at what the definition is it fair signal like the Pharisees fair sétimo means practicing or advocating strict observance of external external forms and ceremonies of religion or conduct without regard to the spirit it means that you're self righteous are hypocritical in other words you're trying to put on an outward appearance of you know like the Pharisees what I pay tithes I do all of these things and and then on the inside like Jesus said they're like whitewashed tombs they painted the tomb white on the outside but on the inside it's not changed it's not too expensive the the grace of God must proceed from an inner work that he moves outward to to change you hourly again so that you can bear fruit it's got to start from the inside so ferry Seco was a legalistic form where they're trying to trying to work out righteousness by the things that they do and that's that's contrary to the gospel the gospel gives you liberty where you don't have to do all these I can this is a little story in Luke chapter 18 work it says two men went up into the temple and pray the Warner Pharisee and the other Republican the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god I thank thee that I am not as other men are and he's looking at it from a legalistic standpoint I don't do like everybody else my works are different than these other people these extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican and it began to look down and you know I wonder sometimes we if you will examine ourselves sometimes we ourselves can get into this mindset that I'm better than other people because I do I do I don't do what they're doing or or you make it you make your salvation about works I fast twice in the week which is good but you're not saved by that look at me I fast twice in the week I wonder if this publican even does as much as that I've yet I give tithes of all that I possess my goodness what that's that's great that's good but that's not how you're saved because you paid the parking lot or you paint the territory I had a breaker to the to the to the building fund or whatever and your publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes in the heaven and in other words he's not looking at it from a works perspective he's crying out for grace I know I'm a sinner but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that homeless itself shall be exalted do you see if you want to get anything from God you come by faith not based upon anything that you can do it you won that one in this situation came to God with all this truckload of works and the other came with nothing there's nothing good in me and he was just crying out for mercy because Galatians chapter 3 there's Galatians for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith that's why Martin Luther just loved the book of Galatians he said this next slide the Epistle to the Galatians is my own epistle I have petrale myself to it it is my kv-1 boy kt1 boy was that none that Martin Luther married and and he called the book of Galatians his Katie because because it's Satan you can't meet if you're trying to meet the requirements of the law there's some little things somewhere that you'll slip that's why we don't judge one another we don't point fingers at one another because if you judge to the other there's some aspect of that that using yourself forgives you do you know a lot of times preachers will get up and you either you know talk about things that you're not so you're not supposed to ever work on Sunday and then you slip up and and for long your work calls you in and you're working on Sunday or something there's no aspect of the law that by yourself you can keep but God kept gone it has kept the that entire all the requirements of the law so when you believe on Him he is satisfied you're justified by your face not by your works in Galatians chapter 2 verse 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified and and you know that and that statement you could get you can get really deep because we're trying to grow into a place where our flesh will be changed this body will be changed so if you want to grow to a depth of understanding to wit the adoption to understand the body change then you must come to a place where you you're not relying on your own works you're relying on the finished prize the price that Jesus paid and to have that kind of a level correlation it's a revelation that God has paid the price so completely that your body can be changed and the works of the law will not justify your flesh doing stuff or not doing stuff will not justify your flesh it's only faith and what he has done that will justify any questions and answers program said oh there's so much of this legalism today that touch not taste not you don't do things legally I didn't come to this church tonight legally I know worse because I got to do it it's that as a law thing and this is where he starts getting into love you do things for God but it's like a marriage when you're married to your spouse you you're not running out cheating on that person or stuff like that you're not and the same thing spiritually you're not going out to listen to the doctor and doing doing things wrong because you love God you love his work but that's what makes you come to church me because you love God not because somebody's gonna bash you over the head because you don't come to church you should have been here that's not that's that's not what your spiritual life is based on I'm not saying that should not be done right because the law in must be preached that's the law aspect of it you're gonna we're gonna preach you need to be a church but one day it will turn into from a legal thing to to a love relationship and that's what he's talking about I felt anything but come down here why did I come there because I love God live or die I must stand here for him it's not because I have to he wouldn't care about whether I did or not think about that if I die I'd go to him and yeah but I'm coming because I love you you serve God because you love him not because you just got to do it because you love him enough and then here you hear me says the law is not a relic a law is the magnifying glass to show you seeing see why the law must be preached I believe the law is gotta be preached it's the one who can put you in prison it's a law but it has no redemption in it look where we're standing there when Peter spoke of that let one keep the law and then we do this and wonderful of that oh I'm so glad that there's somebody else to look to where we're standing in the realm of law and legal all by it we're all condemned and all flesh is condemned by the law and we were all born in sin shapen in iniquity come to the world speaking lies without not even a chance we don't have it how could we stand the Justice of God we couldn't stand it but thank God that he paid the price and all you have to do is like the children to be in Egypt looked at that braise the circum just look at live believe only if faith program said and Abraham was called by a grace in violation and when he was called when he was received his call he was given the Covenant of God not because he was a good man but it was given unconditionally to me not because he did anything but it was given to him just based simply on his faith just believe and everything else will be accomplished now this is going to hurt legalistic legalists believers just a little bit now I don't mean the pitch but we don't want to know the truth see there is nothing that a man can do to save himself you are already saved by grace that's right you can't stop eating meat you can't stop doing this you can't stop there's nothing you can do Christ saves you and that alone and that's right so we go like three more minutes some trouble grab up here and where's your divorce program said as long as I want to go do it it's in my heart to do it well I say as long as I said my heart to do it I don't do it II legalism won't let me do it now see here we're getting into legalism versus grace because there's got to be it is the law exposes that it's wrong to be puffing on a cigar and Indian alcohol and all those kind of things so you're not saved because you stopped doing those things but yet there is a promise in God's work to take that God will give you overcoming power to deliver that so you need a change down and your innermost being to where you don't want to do it anymore that's the power of the gospel there's power in the gospel to be able to take the desire for those think the conscience of seeing away from you to where you don't want to do it anymore and that's where the real truth of the gospel is it doesn't become a works anymore but it becomes a nature change where God is now living on the and has changed your desire from the things of the world to the things of God where now you didn't want to go to church now you won't the word because you're found the thing that will satisfy that first this on the inside and nothing will quench that thirst but the word of God the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart to you want to do it it is capital life you want to do it the Word of God you want to satisfy the Word of God that's the truth of it there is the two schools not legalism or other in Calvinism is both in Galatia I'm closing this stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage to feel like you got to do something to be saved behold I Paul say unto you that ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing your works won't profit you anything for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is the debtor to the whole law if you think they're doing things doing or don't doing things will save you and you try to satisfy one iota of the law in that way now you've got to satisfy the whole ball that way and you got a problem because you can't do it Christ has become a mill effect on these whosoever of you are justified by the law which you cannot be but if you try to justify yourself by the law you are falling from grace I will stop right there [Music] whatever
