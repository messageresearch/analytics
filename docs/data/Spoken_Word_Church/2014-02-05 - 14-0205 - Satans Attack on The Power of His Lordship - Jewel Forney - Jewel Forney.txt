with you appreciate being here on a Wednesday night so we just thank the Lord God to give us strength this evening I'm going to go right to the word of the Lord this evening I'm going to read from the book of genes Genesis in the Book of Genesis the 3r chapter and the 16th verse and I and I so much easier to read it then it is here he says and uh unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow th shall bring forth children's and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee let us go to Ephesians 5 God bless you Soldier yeah praise the Lord let me see Ephesians 5 and I want to begin reading at verse 21 and it reads like this it says submit yourself one to the other in the fear of God wise submit yourself unto your own husbands as unto the Lord that's right for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore the church no therefore as the church is subject unto Christ let the wife be to their own husbands in everything right husbands this is what the broad party on the man husband love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word let us pray father God we ask you one more time help us oh God to yield our bodies and our minds and our soul to you God father God I ask you God to speak one more time through your word Lord now father God I give you all my strength give you all my mind and all my soul and spirit Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening that's right I took from the scripture the way it was saying here it was in the Book of Genesis how was telling Eve it was speaking here after they had fell they told it God dealing with it he told Eve here in the 16th verse he said unto the woman I was unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and a conception and and let me find my place excuse me and conception and thou shall pray for children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now it hadn't always been that way Hallelujah if you notice it was not that way when she was in Adam Hall once she was when she was in Adam Hallelujah if she would have never been separated from Adam it wouldn't have never been a fall right and if there wouldn't have never been a fall there would never been a redeemer right there would never been a savior if there would never been a fall but because there was a fall it opened the door for a redeemer and a savior amen amen yes sir we thinking here in my title this evening is Satan TCT Satan attack on the power of His lordship tan hate one thing in the church and that's lordship that's right and the reason he hate that lordship because it's saying submit yourself one to the other Hallelujah in other words obey them that have rule over you Hallelujah in other words here so he God is telling us hallelujah to be in Authority but also be under Authority Brother Sam is not in himself he's a pastor so he's he got the brother said the Pastor is the supreme authority of the church but really he's under Authority because the word is over him exactly right so that's what the authority is it ain't the man he's in authority to the word and if you hear the man you come in Authority subject to the man and then then you obey God right so we begin to realize so that was Satan main tag y he didn't care Satan don't care how religious you are that's right he don't care how much you worship come on he don't care how much you say you love God he just don't want the Revelation you got hu that Christ not only become God but he become your lord and savior and your Redeemer Hall that's what he don't want right that's right so when I want to look at a few scriptures in Genesis for a few minutes I'm just looking at this in Genesis 1 where God uh you can just write these down real quick where God gave adam Dominion Genesis 1 128 to Adam I'm give you Dominion h i want you to be Lord over the Earth Adam H Adam I'm the Lord of Heaven but I'm giving you lordship how do I give you and Adam I want you to sedu the Earth andwhere I'm going to give you lordship and you shall do it how that mean to keep it in line with the word hallu that when we come here this evening how to keep our life in line with the word h that why you come to church Faith come by hear and by hearing of the word of God to keep your life in line with the word so we begin to look here so when we begin to realize here so but Satan attacked his first attack in Genesis in Genesis 1 I mean 31 I want you to know when Satan moved in for his attack and I know what he told he you know what he he misinterpret the word right but he could not have got in and and brought the destruction to the human race unto first he tack lordship right exactly let us look at Genesis 1 I mean Genesis 3:1 look how it read here it says now the serent was more sub than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made right and he said unto the woman yet God has said ye should not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree uhh the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst Son of God that God has God has said yeah shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it l you die so we got a problem here the problem was when sat come into the Garden of Eden the problem was not God the problem was Lord so the first thing if you notice when he comes into the G the first thing he take out of the word first word ever been took out of the Bible since the creation of time he took Lord out of it amen because the Bible say the Lord God said why Satan didn't quote the eeve what he what it was when God said it he did not come to Eve and say the Lord God said he said God said because he did not have a problem with her having to God neither do he have a problem with you having a God he don't care if you have a God how ever in the world everywhere we go people got God that they worship some in the house some of their car some in their wife some of their job a God he don't care about a God but he when you say Lord you are said I am under protection of his lordship and Lord is the name of protection what the righteous run into not sa Lord so we so we begin to look here he he moved the Lord out of the scripture once he got eeve to say what he said not what God Said right hallelu one word off is Satan kingom right so he just took one word out of the scripture Lord he quoted God to Eve oh yeah and Eve quoted God back right but what she didn't say the Lord God said right she said God said what God how what God Said So now he got her not quoting what God Said got her quoting what he said she had disarmed herself how she become uh pray for the enemy s move right in and took over right man what he do today he he comes in to take out the power of lordship because as long as you under lordship he know he can't get to you right right the Bible don't give and that is a name under the L under that lordship he know long as you under that protection as long as that wife is under the protection as long as the church is under protection of his lordship how the say cannot come here and take it over but once he break down lordship he let the people worship he let the people have a good time how you let say I love God but then he knowing then that longer they worshiping God as long as they have a good time but do not mean that they are protected your protection is under lordship right amen let's look at it this way so now if you notice once she did this she had she moved out of her position she moved from her position cuz she in the beginning she was create it and she walked eagal with God W eagle with Adam when you called Adam she turned around too because she turned around too so in word any because she in word that name was Adam how but if you notice once she uh walked beyond the principles of lordship she received a new name yeah right right Hallelujah she received another name Adam called her name Eve Hallelujah why because she has stepter the the boundary of the protection of God she received a new name the mother all living right exactly I look at this thing here that's right and now we begin to look here and as I was studying this I begin to look here I say now we begin to understand Paul goes over in Ephesians and then Paul begin to put an order again how the position of lordship see now I want you to understand here I'm GNA I'm W to look at a few things real quick I want to be H Paul as he goes over here he put in the position of lordship he begin to tell her this is the order that God want the church to run in so then he if you notice he goes over here and then and and and even God when he came in Genesis and Eve made his mistake he told Eve all right people say well he cursed he he didn't curse you yeah he couldn't curse you without cursing ad d right you know I hear that a lot of times you know you hear that statement they well brother the woman is cursed well and Words If a woman is cursed if you marry yourself to a cursed woman you you curs with her God did not curse he told you this is what going to happen this is the penality you have brought death into it how do you be saved and child burn right and your desire shall be to your husband showing you that she had gave her Desir to somebody else outside her husband how now he was turning her back to her head she he said no longer he you he shall be your ruler that's right he shall rule over you but we going to get to that part in a minute I want to look at a few things real quick before we go forward I looked up the word lordship and I come up with some definitions on lordship and you know and one of the definition was lordship number one definition was having power and authority right that what it means it mean having power and authority I looked at some scriptures I thought here we find here power and authority how I looked up in like like Matthew 7:28 it say he taught as one having Authority and not as the scribes so when he taught his message was just not a me it had power and authority behind it how show them we Preach Today you said brother J do it have to be loud do it have to be this way no it got to have power and authority and only what gives the message power and authority is you stay in the truth and the power behind truth amen right then it also number two it means master and owner right and I find here that Jesus said in Matthew 28 these things I to put down when I got inspired Matthew 28 and and and and and verse 9 and 18 is said and Jesus and Jesus spoke uh Jesus spoke unto him saying all power yeah is given unto me in heaven and earth Hallelujah in other words I am the master and I'm the owner exactly and then then it means the other one mean Empire or King that that was the next definition of an Empire or King and out word I find out Revelation 19:16 it said he's king of King and Lord of lords Hallelujah so at number four definition for it it means father and husband uhhuh father and husband how what did Jesus say Our Father which are in heaven so he he identified himself under lordship and a father and husband Hallelujah and number five it means revelation of deity Glory man that was strong one the revelation of deity Hallelujah the revelation of deity and where so we begin to realize here so that what we want to speak over here on the power of His lordship the revelation of his guilty and I looked up in the Greek that master mean the master mean one Lord who possesses supreme authority Dominion how didn't I looked at these things I begin to think here on lordship man I got sweat in my ey y find oh there you go man thank God my God I just come out of Africa preaching 125 125° it was so hot that you I'm going sweat anyway and the brother said he was looking at me preaching my associate pastor he was there he was there that morning I preaching on that screen he normally my tie dripped he said when he looked at my tie it was running a screen of water he said I don't believe this by the time I got back home I was in the bed for 4 days I'm so tired and weak here just this time it was extremely hot I thank you for your sacrifice I thank you for the offers you gave it went real good we was in Togo we preaching we started off in kamasi we had meetings christma convention in kamasi we left kamasi West Africa we went we went into Togo which is another country across the border you don't want to drive across the border you making a mistake but we done it but we made it across the border normally that's the first time drove we always flyed and took a plane then you know it was a little easy but when you drive across the border you going into a whole different game so then we drove across the border we had meetings at too we come back across too with the cry we started meetings again in 12 days we was there for 12 days they did 18 Services wow it was only had one problem one problem I had when I first went there after the last time I was there it was 8 years ago I come back 8 years later I had one problem I had eight more birthdays this time I could tell it when I come on I had I really tell when I come to side I'm I understand why they say brother I'm getting H I'm not too old yet I ain't going to say that but I can tell you what I can tell that since I was eight years later I told a big different but here we are we talk about lordship here hallelujah in other word possessing Authority and Dominion now we want to begin to look here because I want to realize here why have Satan tacked the position of the woman right yeah right ABS why he attack the church world right why he attack that because he knew if he could break the power lordship he could conquer the nation right remember Eve could not be Eve could not manifest this perversion until she left her head right and the church once you leave your head you'll believe anything right amen so now what she do she go she left her head and what it is that's what he been tagging and that what he been tagging he keep tagging it over and over Hallelujah in other words his lordship he been tagging the lordship of this nation Hallelujah until he finally broke the back bone right right right now what we got we got perversion on every hand right but first he had to T because he knew the woman type the church and he told the woman in Paul us suffer another woman to Usher authority to be submission under the husband how do we know that word right there is hate word in our nation yeah right everybody say why because Eagle rights bringing every uh bringing the woman into the same position that the man in it was against God commandment how she should be under Authority and the man is under God right right so now we begin to look at we begin to take it here as I begin to look here let's us look at little I'm just taking it from a different approach tonight Ain know you ain't never here but it just kind of think about so we found out here tting his tack has been on this position and he been fighting against it all this time because he know if he can break the if he can break the backbone of this nation he could call perversion to come in once he broke the BR bonger headship in the garden he had no longer knew what she was uh in a relationship with she had a relationship with something that was apart from human human mentality right and that what caused our problem right right now what we got we got a bunch of Beast allergy moving over this nation and nothing nobody can do about it right why because she broke the word all the for she had to lead the word what brought the denominations into among of the Beast they left the word and took a beastly seed it was not the seed of a it was not the seed of the word it was the seed of the Beast hallelujah what made her take the bo she took took the seed of the Beast by rejecting headship that's right let look here if I tired Edge the I turn Edge he's speaking on the things here and I'm going to you see where we going in second I turn Edge on a page two Church a book page 2 215 he said now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition and where he's he bringing he look at that he taking the woman he typing out the church she is according to the Holy scripture to be submission to the male right now we know we know in this day and time that is foreign language that's right amen now real submission is you'll see I'm going to get the man cuz I know how these heres in the message look at this submission HJ you know here I am he man I'm wait I finish this and submission and submission to the male for this as the Commandment of her a woman who is truly female and all female would want to be in that disposition not a doormat right right that's it not a doormat right no real male makes a female a doormat but one will want to be under Authority and not to rule over the male for he is the head of the house he is the what right okay we long we want to get that scra is she breaks that image on that God had made for her she is perverted perversion and way it brings her in the spirit that evil was in perversion she would not if she come that way she will be pregnant it by wrong Spirit right and if any man that let the woman break that that image he is perverted and then way and the way bring the spirit of perversion when a woman stepped out of her position and the man let her it put both of them in the spirit of of this perverted ede remember you could not have homosexuality until the woman come out of her place right exactly that's right come on people how many kids is rap without a father right right oh yeah I worked in a school and a little boy had to use a the boy bathroom he didn't know how to use the boy the bathroom like a boy so the the principal said go show him how to use the bathroom he's not a girl but all he been raised with his grandma and his mama yeah so he thought that he should use the bathroom that way so what it do it bring that perversion Spirit over on the over into the male Kingdom once did he left the word she brought she brought that perversion Spirit over with her and the man let down the word it brought it brought the perversion spirit in this nation and in the P pit now we got to pert and then what's the problem the problem was we left the [Music] word ain't no problem it's the problem is they left the word now they don't left so they they totally blashe and God won't accept no repenting no more as a nation that's right now you said brother J you said man that that is a because God is he is our protector and he only protect us as we stay true to the word Jezebel left the word and then when she refused Elijah as her Prophet as her pastor that's right how did she refuse Elijah know what she refused to hear the word for that day which was a prophet right and when she refused the uh when she refused the word it brought the nation into perversion how the people is nothing to do right can you feel Rapture in there it could not the Rapture could not take place until this nation completely reject the word and homosexuality and all the things come to his Peak now we are right at the door look up we don't hear the blood moons taking place we all these things going on in the world you can feel the you can feel something is been ready to happen the thing of it is we got to make sure that we got the toen cuz it's time to go home that's right amen you said brother you what I need I know I need now we find here the submission part the submission is the thing people struggle with how do I Sur I submit myself submission deal how do you submit yourself how will I do it I am it ain't nobody going to tell me what to do Brother Sam ain't going to tell me what to do I got my own mind hu that's what Eve had that's what Eve had her own mind you you stay at your pastor when he stay with the word now see I told you one day we were talking at a table and you know a lot of times brother say I'm going be word of scripture and word is quote brother say the pastor is supreme over the church he's supreme authority over the church as he stay with the word see the word is what got the door not the man see a lot of time the man take that quote and he use that to dominate and nickol all the people we not come to worship a man we come to worship [Applause] God and but sometime you know One Pastor he brought a bunch ofu to church brother I ain't going to call his name he brought a bunch of guess women pan hes whatever and he brought he said all your sisters Come And Get These and all the sister come and got one and the brother come up to him he said why you done that he said I want to see how much control I got over the women's wow now the man is a polygamist yeah you see what I'm saying he was using it to see how much control he had you know cuz the woman would come and get it and he say I can't got she not under my controls so he preaching out of the church HJ so you know so we're not here under nickis we are here to worship God under the revealed word of this day right let let's go in here look so let us look at a little step forward now I want you to notice here I want you to notice here because this is what this is I'm kind of getting to my point here in other words so here we was Eve had took on her own identity she had left Adam had left her husband the word how Adam had no right he could had no right he could let Eve stay and die and be burned with the serpent that's 104 the church book he should not have Tule back the take back he would have to take a harlot because she just proved herself as an Unfaithful wife not wly she was deceive into it that's right that's right and when I was studying this the Holy Spirit begin to break this out here I said Lord I said that's it I you know for your brother Jesus say from the beginning was not so and when I'm think I'm not pre man the voice I'm not preing but I'm just I'm just this is hit me by inspiration and I'm trying to put out here and in the beginning was not so well it was not know a divorce case in the beginning Hallelujah Adam did not put evil way and Adam had a reason for not putting away I looked at the scripture this is what really hit me let us let's go and look at in Genesis 2 Genesis 2 now there brother says you know when she cut her she just she show her unfaithfulness or dishonor of her head right and and she's a you know a believing woman and if a man got an unbelieving wife he should bear with her give her grace in other words and that but he can't not be a pushover but in other word because God didn't when he told now before this whole that play if you Noti here he gave man's a commandment and the Commandment for a man to do is to love your wife right H that that that you know people think and the uh Dominion ship lordship I'm going to make her do what I want her to do well that ain't your dog or your horse that's your wife you when she don't believe the word how how can she B the word when she got a Goliath ruling her she'll never bleed the word that way she got to see Christ on display H how can you get somebody to bleed and you can't live up to the level of Jesus Christ well she Sarah called Abraham Lord in a hor she brother say she called him Lord because he lived up to the word she seen something that she wanted to make him her Lord and if she don't make you Lord you ain't going to get the position right she got to submit herself to give you that position so come on let look here so we begin to look here so I'm going to go on here I say Genesis 2 I want you to notice this scripture right here and this is what scru my attention but I got stirred up don't tell me I sweated it out no there you go believe it or not I got me I care I got a plastic B I carry yeah yeah when I went to Africa I got a plastic B so I wouldn't sweat the letters out cuz I knew I was going to sweat a lot so I got you can order them on you can order them so I got I ordered me one so I can car The Advocate with me cuz sometime I get to a place and I sweat out then a whole two or three letters swe out I'm like what is that yeah so so so I begin to look at Genesis 2 I want you to let me find my place Genesis 2 let us look at verse 21 okay do what God told Adam Genesis 2 verse 2111 and the Lord God the Lord God he never and word he put this right back in the scripture it's good I like this man this help me I thank God for science yes sir amen I mean we got have it you might well face it know people can say what they want to but we I mean tell it's pretty good if you use it the right way h God and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof how word god did a first surgery and then leave a scar exactly H did a sign surgery took out a real and didn't leave a scar right right then it go in here and the and the real which the Lord God had taken from the man he made a woman and brought her unto the man y right Hallelujah in other words it then and Adam said Hallelujah not God Adam said he was he remember he had lordship hall now Adam said exactly Hallelujah and Adam said let me and Adam said this is bone of my bone right and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called what woman because she was taken out of womb who gave the first birth in Earth was a man right Hallelujah you know he he gave birth first Hallelujah eat from of her when he gave her birth took her from his side how sure everything had to come through him first H so go to here therefore therefore shall a man leave what father why we you get married you got to go come on that's right all right you got to go come on you can stand up until you get married right when you get married you got to be looking to go right when you come home it going to be a sign on your door I don't go there I live here anymore that's right so you long as you a't married stay home like that little brother back there in the back saving all that money up so when he do get married stay home him save it up save it up but when you get married you got to go can't be two cheese in the house yeah I told one man he I worked with a guy one time his son was rebellion and he told his son say I'm tell you son you either going to have to leave my house it can't be two of us here he I tell you what if you beat me I'll leave if I beat you you leave yeah he come to work I seen his eyes all black I said man what has happened to him over the weekend and the guy said he told his son if he beat him he'll leave if he beat him well the story is it he the one moved out right yeah so don't do that you might think you float like a butterfly now that a but therefore man shall leave his father and mother and shall clean unto his wife right and they shall be what man so Adam God told Adam for this CA shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall unto his wife and they shall be one flesh I want to right there I want you to notice that and what got my attention to this is when I looked this word up clean mean Inseparable right it means one mate in other word So Adam when God told Adam I'm going to eat the clean to you Hallelujah when Adam saw his wife Coming she was in a condition that Adam did not have to take her back that's right right exactly but it was displaying the love of God Adam did not save Eve because Adam need Redemption for himself Adam just play What Love isah Adam loved his wife so much that he went out behind the word to take his wife back right knowing that God was going to come down right God loved his son so much that himself he came down in the garden Hallelujah in other words Adam would not L if Adam would had took her back God had to destroy her right but when Adam took her back Hallelujah she was part of Adam now God could not score he without destroying Adam right just like God could not destroy how he would not let the devil have so God himself had to come down and make a way back that what we F that why we got Redemption it ain't through it because when we fa Adam the first Adam man he fell he walked out behind the word of God and took took e by brought the whole human race into adultery brother he that joined himself to adulteries is adulteries right he joined the whole human race into adulteries invisible Union brother said we was all born adulteries exactly I don't care how holy you are I don't care what family you were born in I don't care how long you been if you don't be born again you are born in adultery you come to the world speaking lies right who taught you how to lie yeah come on right I mean you said well how you learn how to lie I didn't read a book to learn how to lie I could have been a lawyer at one time I ain't getting I didn't had to go to school for it I could have been a lawyer I mean you know who's bad that just the way things was you you li so much you start believing in yourself yeah but what caused that because we were born that way amen we were born with this corruptible nature how we come in the world under this adultery act how we was in we shaped in iniquity we were born the wrong way from the beginning so we Automatic by Nature we was adulterate how did the brother say invisible Union page 33 he said that is the reason you were born in adultery because you were a centner to begin with that's right you were you were dece into you had in other word it's not it's not your it's not no no it is not your fault you never did it because that little germ man he go to the Jour he goes to the mind of God out of the way that God saw you not the way that you saw yourself he that little germ that was to be you and found you and before the foundation of the world and your name was put in the L's book of life so he put this an adulterous now we realize Revelation teacher ain't no adulterous going to enter the Kingdom of Heaven how no adulter why you think Jesus telling Nicodemus you must be born again because I canot you in under that nature that nature cannot come in the presence of God that's right that what the new birth is for what the new bir yes sir so we begin get here so Adam took Eve to himself he walked out if we got the scripture Commander don't let no man put a son hallah don't let no man Eve came to Adam when she came to Adam she was already had perverted herself she had mixed her human SE up with a beast right that was real low really yeah that real low and she brought it to Adam and God couldn't accept Adam did not have to accept her in that condition right but just said husband love your wife right yes Adam said I'm not letting this separate me from my wife I love her right right so he laid the whole human Kingdom in the death yes he did because he loved her right right Hallelujah and we had another Adam came amen called the second Adam Hallelujah he came from his Glory Hallelujah never know what it was to never know what it was to feel SE never know what it was to F what death is he came from his glory and he took on a roll of sinful flesh yes sir amen so he can find out what we going through he can find out when you having your good times and bad times when you going through your weariness and your tiredness and sickness he came now he took sin upon himself Hallelujah without being born in sin he became sin how he became s not not he said he took your sin and he took my sin and he came here he I'm going to take my wife back exctly that's right I'm going to take my wife back hallu she come in the world speaking lies already pregnated with the devil but I'm going to come down through the washing of the water of the word under the headship of the word and I'm going to take her back to myself how that what God done for you yes sir that what God done for me am we find out here God love is what restrain God to come down and do this to me do this for me and my love for him Lord help me to surrender right amen she s that on more I Surrender the more he take control help me to surrender myself how you submission mean to surrender H what surrender what surrender all my human effort surrender all my desire let my desire be for the word how will I surrender to the word I come submission to the headship of this church which is your pastor he all of God to leave you through right you got to have a head order to make this St operate right you find churches without a head Shield yeah you'll find a woman that'll believe anything y That's right why they can they set at home and bed say I can make it on tape Ministry and you go back and you look at how their life changes how they live so loosely all that why because they have no headship that's right have no fresh anointing to discern the spirit for that time or clean them from service the service how do they come to church how do they go home and they never get those Spirits took off of them and God got to judge them come on it ain't nothing wrong with having a bad Spirit what's wrong if you don't get rid of it right right cuz we all to Still In the Flesh right so we going here let me just take this a little step further then I'm not going to try to keep you all night but I just want you to look here so love husband love your wife right even as Christ loved the church and gave himself Hall gave himself forth Hallelujah that we you know that he may present us a chair a a a church that's been uh that's been chased not having spot or wrinkle H why word because he don't want nothing in our life that going to hinder us that when he come he took us to himself that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having Spot Not A Wrinkle or not any such thing but it shall be be holy and Without Blame right exactly so we he he don't we we just we come in here Lord let me come to the revelation of your lordship right now I want you to notice this before Jesus came I mean when Jesus walk with his disciples excuse me had you ever noticed the whole time Jesus was on Earth with his disciples they never acknowledged his lordship they acknowledged they'll say they called him they called him uh Master right did you remember that they called him Master right they called him teacher when Nicodemus met him he approached him and he says uh in other word he he came to him call me and rabi they called him on the thing let uh how did let the St John 3 one Nicodemus come to him in St John 3 verse one and the Bible teaches us that Nicodemus there was a a man of the Pharisee named Nicodemus a ruler over of the Jews the the same came to Jesus by night saying un him rebi you notice they never come to him they didn't come to him never preaching him in the Lord Jesus Christ while he was on Earth H they came to him he came to him R Master Teachers H even they they acknowledge Jesus you remember this lady she came to Jesus and she was needing something for him and she called him the name she said thy son of David thy son of David he was not even going to deal with her on that level how because he was not her he was not son of David to her dog right that's right right but when she said Lord she moved into Redemption exactly that was a Redemptive name his seven Redemptive name is under the Lord when she say Lord right cuz he was the Lord to Healing all the disease she got what she want you got to know when you approach him you have to approach him the right way that's so he goes on here says here and Nicodemus he's a rebbi and then what he come he come to Jesus and he's giving Jesus a compliment for his ministry if a man he said we know that there a teacher we know Satan know the power of His lordship Satan have Satan only not only do he know he believes in one God one faith and one baptism the problem of he got he cannot submit to it right he cannot let him become his ruler he wanted his own will but say know who he is more than the people do right that's right Jesus had to tell demon to hold your peace don't you tell the people who I am right exactly right sure is exactly because they know who he was but they blind the people to believe something else right that's right so nemon came to him he said Rabbi he said we know that th teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou does except God be with him in other words so now see if you notice if you noce he said no man does any Mir except God be with him he never could he didn't say except the Lord God he said except God go he can he can acknowledge his godship but not his lordship H so Jesus if you give somebody a compliment on something praise now I'm going to give the difference between praise and worship here come this man he come to give Jesus praise for something that he was doing for his miracles he was doing that deserve praise Hallelujah Jesus should have been excited because the teachers and the rabbi understood his Miracle he another words they giv somebody come up to you know it's hard somebody come say look what you do hallah you think thank you that's praise right somebody buy you a new car you going to praise him you going to be glad to tell everybody that brother right there he just brought me a new car H you know I mean it's just that way it's just that way if if somebody do something for you is pray they gave Jesus pray H but Jesus never even acknowledge it he never acknowledged the praise service right he told Nicodemus you must be born again Hallelujah why because you got to come into the revelation of who who this Lord is H the only way you can know him is by the new birth Glory right that's it so you understand once they got the Holy Ghost once they got the Holy Ghost Peter didn't no longer he didn't need to call him Master he said this Jesus that you crucify he both Lord and right Paul met him on the road to the master hallu after Paul started writing the word of God he never wrote him as as Rabbi he never wrote him as Master he never WR teach he said this Lord Jesus Christ he understood his deity yes sir amen hallelujah that what the Revelation doing we we don't know we know him his praise in way he told you must be except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God you will never recognize his lordship without the birth no man can call Jesus the Christ without the Holy Ghost so that Revelation Alone come by the new birth amen that's right hallelujah amen so I begin to look around but now I'm going to define the difference between praise and worship cuz people get worship and praise mixed up you know you know praise is to give somebody you moderation for something that they done you can give anybody praise yeah anything you can praise but you can't worship any in other words if you going to worship something that going to become your God or your lord or whatever it is cuz now you moving into a different uh a different uh in other word you in word praise you give but worship you moving into a different Channel H so here it is so now what you understand when Jesus came he had to he had to defy the differ between praise and worship in his ministry H if you remember when he met the woman at the well how do we he come to her and all the stuff we know he told her her sins and went on and then she he said I father the worship in this mountain but Jesus knew that was not a worship service that was only a praise service right hey Jesus said yeah I know they worship it in mou but they don't even know what they worship right exactly whatever they were doing in the mountain they would not worshiping God they would up there they might have been praising the a God right righten but they didn't know what they were praying worshiping you cannot worship God except you know him right so Jesus turned around and say they to worship he it going to come a time you going to worship a God in Jerusalem another in this mountain but you will worship me and spirit and Truth worship is know who you are you shall know the truth that's right and the truth should make you bring you to worship so when you come the truth you say what is my worship service is what we doing tonight we didn't come we didn't just come to have a some Churches tonight is a Wednesday night shouting service yeah that's right yeah when you see what y'all do man we shout the place down shout it over what yeah right did word dress you and give you script to fight the next battle so you can live right and won't be doing crooked business deal cheating everybody lying on the telephone all this what did the word do for you right come on Amen right so I'm going to get ready to close out going so here it is this love husband love your wife even as Christ loved the church right and he gave himself for it that is a commandment right and the Commandment is love your wife live the right kind of life so that your wife can see Lord in you right you say she ain't going to you ain't going to get it you say oh Hallelujah you got a bad Temple you think she going to worship call you Lord she might say Lord out a mouth but in her heart she call you Goliath right she but you might have a she y Lord and she said when she said Lord she said Lord Goliath right but love gives her the ability to submit herself to give you the ability to become Lord hallelujah in other words you become a protector you become a provider you become a security how do you become a in know a woman must feel secure right in order to be able to feel this lordship she got to be feel secure cuz the Lord is the name of protection only why do we we all every man want to feel security right yeah that why we got insurance M if you don't got insurance you got to have a buy B right somebody breaking your house your house ain't C by Insurance you realize I'm going come to a loss so you buy insurance for security right in other words you get enough insurance right there everybody put insurance on everything to day they put insurance on their wife the dog everything else they got everything die you get prosper from yeah I say I start call up I got 20 dogs I want to put his short on yeah I ain't going to tell him it's hot dogs but they you know everybody want to feel secure yeah they really want to feel the sense of security so now I got a burger Lo in my house so when I lay down I can sense Security in know words I can lay down and you can lay down at night and you know that burger is there it gives you a sense of security and where you you and where something shake the door the window I got when the ones once the atmosphere in the house change it automatically go off somebody raise a window the wind blows in all might change the atmosphere my Burger La go off and if it don't go off and I hear you coming up the steps you going to hear 45 go off right right so you feel secur you know that's what it is that what lordship is we feel secure because we know he going to protect so Paul that what Paul trying to get us to see in the word hallelujah husband love your wife as the man stay under godhe headship the church stay up under the man has submitt herself not to the man but to the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the word made flesh right words so now we going on here we look here one more thing I want to bring this love here must be displayed in a way that a circumstance see people let circum they say well the circumstance come up and I no longer can go to church anymore Brother Sam I got too many things going on in my life in my home I no longer can I come to church first thing they do they ready to quit God circumstances in other words circumstances does not change God's mind right if God love you it ain't nobody can do nothing about it right I mean you know word God loved Jacob and I don't care what Jacob done it didn't change God mind about Jacob Hallelujah in other words we would have probably put jaed out cuz he done done Esau real wrong yes sir he did and we would have judged the matter we would have said that low down deceiver I mean that's the way I would looked at it that is human instinct I mean you know good G he done beat him out all his money sto everything the man had and in other word but God did not change his mind about Jacob Jacob I have loved and Esau I have hated hallelu so in words so God love you it ain't nothing nobody can do about it right amen you said wa what you said mayy you say well if God love me and I'm doing this and I'm doing that I'm not serving God what would God do he'll take you home abely he said that's why many weaken and sicking among us because God loved them and he took them off he took them home early hallah a lot of time we see early grave and that person is a waverer and he never get sell God take him home right that's that's God love really right so now I going to read one more scripture then I'm going to let you go for Theon night I'm going to read here that why Paul wrote about God love Paul it was no other Apostle could write with the feelings that Paul wrote it you noce why God let Paul write so many it ain't none of them could write with the feelings that Paul write it the scripture with so Paul wrote it with a feeling Hallelujah like no other wrote all of them had the experence was God Paul never met Jesus In the Flesh he never went fishing with Jesus he never went hunting with Jesus he never had a fish ride never got on a boat ride with him according to history he never even met the man but he still met him but he didn't meet him as master or teacher he met him as the Lord Jesus Christ the anointed revelation of the word how so he met him that way so he knew him the same way even in depth more than what the disciple knew and they went fishing with him so that don't mean because you people grew up in new brother BR they ain't got nothing to do with it if you met him by re you met him in the you met him in the way that God intend for you to meet him without seeing him he been revealed to you nobody can't take that T from you you got people that saw brother Brandon people explain the dty of God away and made him worship a man right yeah right you had enough preacher that could took the deity of Jesus Christ away and turned to people to wash a man that was born the same way I born how did brother Brandon was a man that knew how to yield himself so God can speak right right that why we giving respect but we not just going here and why people going back on the message because they Tred to look at a man mate instead of looking at the revelation of Jesus Christ right yes sir this message is real to me not because some man taught it because I met Jesus Christ it's real because I know who he is so let me look here this last so Paul wrote this thing as you turn to Romans 8 I'm going close out with that one why could Paul write this scripture with such impact with such Revelation because Paul had come to a realization in his life he could look at his life he could say if God did not love me this way I already have blasphemed yeah and he knew he should have went to hell right right Paul was not dumb he knew he said I have blasphemed right and there was no forgiving for blashe right Hallelujah other word and other what death was on death should have struck him down he should went straight to hell for what he done he he literally disqualified himself in the scripture by killing a person with the Holy Ghost had better for a millstone to be TI around your neck you throw it to the depths of the sea and Dr he left himself no way back right but love just like he did she left herself no way back but love Adam loved what doesn't work for Eve right amen I'm going to read this one here and this is the one we'll close with Hallelujah he spoke right here in Romans 8 I'm going to read from the verse verse 35 down to the last verse 39 Paul speaking from Romans 8:35 down to verse 39 here and I like the way Paul said it huah that was Hing going to cut that on man I was sitting there thinking I I hope you thank you bro hallelujah hallelujah that's all right Paul says here see the point of it is when we think about God love we put conditions on it sure we do right you know we make a mistake we say well God going to put me in hell I made a mistake God love don't work her that way cuz God love don't have nothing to do with the way your human effort is your human weakness if God judge by weakness everybody going to hell today without pass and go right right cuz somebody going to get mad somebody going to have how do you say but one brother I hear one preacher got up today and he were preaching a message I going call name he said if you had one evil thought today you're not a Christian I said well that put us all out right him too that's right him to you if you had had one evil thought today you know what that mean that mean that you are in the cemetery exactly that's that's when you stop having them in the cemetery so if you a but Paul said so now he he he he he bringing this love he bringing God love he not using human ability human effort how did this is the way that God sees you hlah so he he going to disqualify circumstances right CU everybody want a circumstance not to serve everybody want to circum I would have served God huah but I was dis I a disgrace yeah yeah I've been having so many tribulations in my life I might well to give up on God how can God give up on you right right his love won't let him give up on you am right brother so Paul says here who shall separate who that that's that's you that's me right tell the point of it is we want to put everybody else in it when it say us but hey I'm putting my name right there Hallelujah because I realize this is God love the reason I keep going Hall it ain't because I hadn't fail short and should have went to hell I don't made enough mistakes to be there but by God love there something on the inside that keep breaking you back to God that is not by yourself that ain't by yourself God done that work in you if you got a desire to serve God that is God doing the work you have not blasphemed cuz if you blasphemed you won't have a desire to serve God that's right Hallelujah he said who should separate us from the love of who Christ sh tribulations people I had a bad te ever since I hear tribulation coming my way that ain't going to separate you though right said tribulation or distress or persecution we going to come we can see that coming up on the world how if this thing the way this government going where this nation is going sooner or later we going to feel the persecution but remember we not ordained to go through the tribulation before they try to squeeze us up we going to go up Hallelujah it going to make the reason he got to put a little bit of pressure on us because we don't got too relaxed and lay out seal right and the eagle won't fly as long as he's in the nest right so the mama Eagle got to take that little Eagle fire him out and Shake him so he can start so God got to do this to get us out of Nest right and we got to get out of a comfort zone right and I tell you what lay SE and run even I have problem with it you tell today people had to walk two miles to be Church to be empty tonight in Africa they walk three one brother said brother Toby said they was walking in the convention someone walking 15 to 30 miles just to get there you think American person going to do that you better wake up oh goodness 30 miles to church yeah no sir buddy I I get on the internet Hallelujah that that American people look cuz we got so many convenience we got everything so here that we don't come so sof in other words in myself included I boy when I want a cup of coffee I don't want to go in there and take all day to warm up I put in the mic away you know I ain't going to go in there and put a pot on the stove and warm it up if I got a mic away I'm sure you going to do the same thing and so when persecution we have a hard time with this stuff sh persecution on famine or negative or the P of the soord and it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are cting for Sheets as count for chief for the slaughter and all day long mind battles troubles in your way tribulation the devil fight over and over how it feel like you're not even worthy to be a Christian but you can't look at the way you feel we got n in all these we are more than a what through him that love us Christ see you he sees you Victorious you got to say well I don't feel Victorious regard how you feel right is what he said about you that exactly he says here and when Paul preaches he been preaching on the things know that I've been teaching on them but something in this 38 verse must have scru Paul yeah cuz now it's like he's not even talking to us himself got involved you got to get involved with your Revelation so now Paul get caught up in the Revelation himself Paul I am persuaded why did he say that in all the rest of his scriptures he wrote this thing com so real the PA I am persuaded it became his Revelation and once God become your Revelation ain't nobody you become persuaded that nothing can separate you Paul said I am persuaded that n need a death not a life not of angels not a principality not a power not a th present or not of things to come right not a height not a depth not any other what right preach shall be able to separate who from the love of who which is in who Lord this Revelation that God put in your soul is unseparable that's why we keep coming back what told us this that we got the truth what told us why this is true it's something Inseparable in our heart told this is the true Revelation how you see God you don't try to make it happen it just happens and the musici is coming tonight God Bless you that's amen amen amen I love this I love the Lord hallelujah you wouldn't think these these guys didn't gave their whole life just to believe a lie that's not him so you don't think that Brother Sam just took some theory in a book and been serving God him and his wife till they H and turn gray because they love God right this Revelation means something to them right you see I see people when you come back year to year you just this is not a play play thing this is not a fictional imagination it's because somebody done found something real they can't let go of in other they just love him they keep loving if God take them home how all you can say brother say love God how brother je love God that's all you can say he held on to it until the end of the race right and the race was given to the SW to the but he that didn't do it to the end
