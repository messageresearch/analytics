========================================

good to see everybody in the house of the Lord be glad to have our visitors now I know one's not a visitor maybe the other one's been here when you come here one time you're not counting the visitor anymore so if you've ever been here one time but we do say welcome to you you know and make yourself at home glad to have brother Claude weisinger with us today and we're expecting the Lord to support a blessing upon us and just remember all the announcements and remember pray one for another that the Lord would bless all of us and open our eyes as we hear the word of the Lord right so let's sing that as our brother comes to speak unto us brother Claude westinger Bartlesville Oklahoma open the eyes Open the Eyes of My Heart holy holy holy eyes like we hope oh amen It's a Wonderful song always always enjoy coming out here for the people the music the church I just honestly I can find no fault with this church can I tell you that I really can't like you know oh uh pilate had to say that about Jesus is that right he said I can find no fault in this man why do you persecute him I can honestly say no fault with this church wonderful Ministry I'm excited to be here and be able to be a little part of it this morning appreciate brother Samuel and sister Peggy uh my mother's name sister Peggy and sister Peggy's a lot like my mother uh that that name Peggy my mom if you wanna if you want to know what she thinks about you ask her sometimes sister Peggy you don't even have to ask her and some sometimes my mother's that way it really doesn't bother me because actually I'm a lot like my mother so I couldn't understand where sister Peggy's at nothing wrong with that uh uh you know every joint supplyeth in the church is that right we're workers together there's none of us separate if you separate yourself you become a domination you can become a one-man denomination that's the biggest fear I have right and uh we don't want to do that brother random said denomination of course is death he gave it a name in this hour so we appreciate last time I was out here I preached on the book of redemption I was preaching out of Revelation and I know people told me they enjoyed it I thank God you did you know I get to enjoy it before you do God gives me the Revelation then I give it out to the church and what I did when I went home to kind of give you an idea how I got where I'm at in the world Minister day I've been on the same series since I left here and the series has been the seven feasts of the Lord and what I did was when I preached the book of redemption next thing I did when I went home because you know you preach a mystery of redemption there's more to it there's always more to the you it's Eternal do you understand that when you get over the other side these things that you've learned here is going to be a tip of the iceberg God's going to keep unfolding to you over there so that feeling you get here when you come here and you get a revelation you want to run around the building can you imagine what it's going to be like where every day every minute of the day God's going to be unfolding to you it's going to be subliminal do you understand we don't have human words to even express what it's going to be like over there so when I went home I said okay where did what books in the Bible did Brother Branham call or refer to as the book of redemption well I found there were five of them one of them was Book of Revelation well I preached the book of redemption here I already preached Revelation then he preached Ruth I went to Ruth and I I preached a series out of Ruth and then I went to uh Exodus is where I'm at right now and exodus I've been in Exodus now for since last September is where I've been and then what I'm fixing to do I'm gonna go to Joshua because Joshua parallels the fishes and Ephesians is a book of redemption did you know that it shows how that perfect Church they were redeemed and brought back Redemption has two things you got to come out and you've got to go in so Redemption ain't just you come out of the world and the things of the world you've got to go into Christ is that right so we don't want to stop halfway like he said last night in the Bible look if you're happy where you're at today I'm going to worry about your experience exactly I'm going to be honest with you if you get complacent and there's ease in the Church of Zion you're in a terrible spot because you the holy spirit is moving water and like the old son of the move is on the bride is moving we're moving out of here we're going higher higher higher is that right so I'm gonna I'm gonna continue on but I want to call it the seven feasts of the Lord and what I want you to understand is a lot of people this is a mistake what a lot of people in the message make they take a quote brother Brandon uh said and and they don't run it through their Bibles do you understand that brother random says faith final resting places in the word so if I get a quote what I try to do I feel like I'm obligated face final resting places in the word to finish your Revelation and to put you on establish you on a foundation which is Faith I got to take these quotes and find them in the word just to be a quote quota anybody can read the quotes and quote quote but do they know their Bibles do they know the author of that Bible that's the real question in the era we are so what I try to do is I try to go back and show them where these little things brother Brown said was in the word and then the people will be established you can't go out there and preach brother Branham to them you better go out there and bring them your Bible because I've said sums you know where brother Ram said the three wise men were you know him represented the Gentile the Samaritan and the Jew you can't find that in your Bible I said that to assembly God one time woman she said show me in the Bible I never could but you know what I had a prophet it was a Divine interpreter of that word and I took him at face value but I shouldn't have said that out there they got to receive a profit before they get to further apart so you better be careful when you say you're quoting brother Brandon you better have your Bible to back it up that's what I'm telling you they'll embarrass you I got embarrassed and I but it was a lesson learned for me okay not keep you standing we're going to read the scripture they got displayed up there uh Leviticus 23 2 and I want to jump over to Leviticus 23 4 and and again what I was getting ready to say and I kind of stopped the trouble of people are they say with Daniel 70 weeks they say well that's the Daniel and their people like we don't need that part of the Bible when in Revelation 10 it says the bride ate the whole book last time I checked Daniel was a part of it right then people will say okay the trumpets are to Israel they have nothing to do with the Gentiles so you know what most the message preachers do they throw it on a dumpster right just along with Daniel 70 weeks don't they exactly and but you know what it's you go look brother random said in a quote I'll give you the Feast of trumpets runs from Revelation 6 all the way to Revelation 20 19. or as you throw away Feast of the tropics you might as well tear up revelation 6. to 19. right am I am I telling you the truth that's what he said so people you better you better get these things and start figuring out what brother Brown said and it's the ministry that's supposed to get this to the people amen and the failure in this hours of ministry the failure in Jesus hour was describes the fair the ministry the failure Moses Ministry was the 70 were ministers they're the ones that troubled him brother Ben said the ones that give me my biggest problem are ministers the ones that give the bride the biggest problems are the quote the ministers that's why you may you'll notice I'm hard on preachers because look they're not coming up to where they need to be let's just face it they're the people are having to message people or have to endure these quote message preachers brother said a church age book they'll endure the ministry the preaching if you're enduring the ministry here hey you ain't right A to B preacher hey you both ain't right you need to we need to get this thing we need to get ourselves positioned okay let's go Leviticus 23 2. speak into the children of Israel and say to them concerning the Feast of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim preach proclaims preach to be holy convocations they're holy Gatherings a convocation is a gathering or an assembly even these are does it say Israel cease what is tell me what it says my feast so people preach on the feast days because they say well that's the Israel the Bible don't say that exactly that's their Revelation what they think it says Revelation 23 4 these are the feasts of the Lord huh even holy convocations holy Gatherings which ye shall Proclaim in their Seasons so there's a season for every one of these Feasts that's what I want to talk about I'm going to kind of tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna talk about the first four feasts I'm gonna fly through them don't get discouraged if you don't get it okay because the first four feasts is so thoroughly covered in the Bible in the message I think you ought to know that it's by now the Feast of trumpets I'm gonna land there and I'm gonna stay there for quite a while then I'm gonna try to make it to the Feast of atonement if I can that's as far as I've got in our church these seven feasts I preached 60 Parts on it already but I broke it down to the offerings to the Tabernacle to the every minute detail of them just what your pastor did with predestination remember Ephesians is a book of redemption when you're a pastor you may say he preached 60 Parts on predestination he preached 60 parts of redemption exactly you need to recognize what the wheelchair is hitting from your pastor let's bow our heads your heavenly father we thank you for the reading the word pray that you give the people a revelation brother and said well we need the most the most important thing that this church can receive right here today is a revelation may they get that Lord and you look up the definition of revelation you click on it it means coming how did you know we're looking for a coming a meeting in the air we see descended down on Sunset mountain in 63 but as he come to you the individual he has to come to you and that's what it's all about you have to take that the book from the mighty Angel not for the seven Church age messenger from the mighty Angel that's the experience in this hour that's the seventh seal that's when it's finished and you drive a state down be with us in this service we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen sorry to keep you standing let's go to the I guess page two I have like 42 pages so you know I got to fly through it I can't you know I can't get it all but I want to show you some things where it kind of got me going and just briefly touch on again the verse 4 piece but I'm really really want to get to you the trumpets I think I think the troubles trumpets are probably just as misunderstood as Daniel's 70 weeks and it's because Brethren said whether to Israel it's the same attitude but what does Daniel say it's unto Daniel his people so we just we see Feast of Tabernacles or the seven trumpets and we just blow right by him oh that's the Israel but if you don't understand it you're not going to understand the Book of Revelations simply put I don't know how else to say it right you're not and what does the scripture say blessed is the man that readeth and understandeth the says of this book this book The Book of Revelations this is the book that actually is the coming of the Lord again I want to say it because I think it's an important point you can say the Jesus came in 1963 that cloud wonderful I'm glad you see that right but have you seen that coming to you amen that's what you were getting at last night in Roman Paul spoke from a personal revelation he put his name on that Revelation does everybody understand that have to have a personal Revenue I got told the church I said you ever notice it and on the world they say you know somebody if they don't have flesh in it it don't concern them I got news for you we all got flesh in this one this is these Soda Man and what is the these subtle man is when the words made flesh right when you see receive a revelation to write Revelation it's the word becoming flesh so the Revelation isn't coming to you it's him coming right inside his flesh in the form of a revelation pretty easy isn't it we ought to we ought to be able to explain these things to people hurt people running around like these creatures like turkey with their head cut off they don't know what they're doing right and I say I'm hard on I'm sorry but it just it irritates me we've been in a message 50 years and we're still singing preaching God sent a prophet God said a prophet God said what did he say right I get it I understand God sent a prophet that ain't going to get you in a Rapture the Rapture book this is what I tell my church the people in the message have made a atrocious mistake because Brethren have said in a Rapture book The Rapture is a revelation does everybody agree that's what he said so what they do they think there's a silver bullet out there so one of them says the Thunders that's it so it's their interpretation of Thunder's at seven men seven Thunders and you've got to fall under their Ministry false and they think this is this is the Revelation or a revelation is you're gonna make a Rapture with and there's another group of guys that's perusia another group of guys that's the the two Lords but what they do and some it's the son of man right I'm gonna be honest with you they fall in love with one Revelation they say this is the Revelation is going to make a Rapture go read the Rapture book Brethren talks about all the revelations does everybody understand that it's it's it's the it's you've got to take all the revelations and put them together and the Revelation is Jesus Christ so it's a revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word so what they're doing they're looking for a silver bullet or you're sitting around maybe in this church looking for one Revelation that's going to take you out it's going to take every word to proceedeth thou the mouth of God this hour is the fullness of the word Luther's message will not get you to a rapture it won't we have received in this hour the fullness of the word and if the message preacher is not preaching the fullness of the word leaving because he can't get you to a rapture and you need a pastor right amen amen you need a man a Shepherd that's going to feed you the word that's the only way he is a true Shepherd this is a quote when I went home I was looking up you know I what I did I looked up Booker and I said okay I want to preach out to Exodus I put the word Exodus and read every quote that's why I do it when I get a subject people think I'm crazy if I get 987 quotes I read them all I must be crazy I sometimes I think I'm kind of loose you know but I want to know what it says all the way from 40 and 8 all the way to 65. some of the things he said in 54 he changed some of me didn't right your brother Robert had something wrong he'd corrected it right amen I preach at home I preached a sermon that morning and went home still studying the subject and realized I left the wrong impression and I come back at night and I'll you know what I'm not so big I can't say I'm wrong right man there's preachers in this message there's one in particular I'll tell you a girl that goes to our church he was preaching two Lords and she was going there and he said you showed me in the message where brother man says it can't be two Lords she was reading one day in a book she found her brother and said he's not two Lords she went in and knocked on his door to his office took the message book up and said you told us if we can find a quote bring it to you she brought him the quote he got up on his nuts get out of my office are you kidding me this is a guy that'll say to let us reason together yeah if he's wrong and you can prove it by the Bible I believe this man will correct amen exactly if I'm wrong you show it to me the message in the Bible oh correct amen right do I believe I know everything no I don't but let's see if you think you know everything you know with nothing he said if you got it all figured out you're wrong start over right you don't ever get that attitude and you're I'm always learning I can read the seals this year and read them next year and God gives me a further Revelation and we were talking in the back some preachers you know that's what scares me you use it right but there's some preachers that investigate well it's Progressive what they're really saying is they progress Beyond brother Branham and the message they got you can't find under their messenger that's what they're saying I don't use the word Progressive I looked it up there's not one quote that says Progressive in the entire bio an entire message but there's one word I believe it's a stimulation of Revelation and wine gets stronger with age this Revelation gets stronger every time I pick up the seal so I I'm not condemning him because he says it because he explains what he's saying but you get some of these preachers that say that they're going beyond the prophet right and the bride is the final voice to the final age under her messenger under it God finished the mysteries in William Branham I tell our church if somebody comes this Pulpit preaches a mystery you run from them right because we're preaching a revelation not a mystery right right does everybody got what I'm saying the mysteries of God are finished I'm not looking for Brethren I'm back to come back to preach me anything he doesn't preached it I got to get a revelation of what he said so the most important thing the emphasis in this hour is revelation above all right and that's what I want to emphasize and if you get your Revelation right you'll exalt Jesus Christ amen you won't exalt him exactly you won't exalt the church you won't exalt yourself you'll exalt Jesus Christ that's what that sister accused brother random she said brother random you talk about Jesus too much okay yeah I don't know if you get the atonement you're gonna you're gonna put Jesus way up here and everything else is going to be below that the most important thing in my life is Jesus Christ what it is first quote let's read it he says here we're talking we're taking Israel now in their Journey coming out of Egypt type of the world on their way to Palestine the Promised Land I think it's a beautiful thing I just love it pretty listen to this this is your Prophet said this pretty near every week right I sit down and read through the book of Exodus right is that a shocker every week I read through the book of Exodus or as much of it as I can right I love it because it's a perfect time for the church today the condition how God was moving he moved in what he did in the natural then he's doing in the spiritual now see it and I got to thinking on this quote I said why why did Brother Branham want to read what drove him to What Spirit did he have that pushed him to Exodus and I realized brother Ram is an exodus Prophet right Moses was an exodus prophet Moses said there's going to come a prophet like an unto means right what was Jesus an exodus Prophet every time you see an exodus Prophet an exodus you see three things a prophet a pillar of fire and a cloud exactly did you see that with Moses right did you see it with Jesus Christ remember he went up in cloud of witnesses the descended only River the light in the form of a dove all those things show all those things showed up with William Branham exactly so without a fault by the scripture I can prove to you William Branham was an exodus preacher right prophet and he was taking us out of denominationalism are exactly some of you may have never been in denomination you're in the world the world is the result of denominationalism go to Walmart these women are stripped off the preachers have done it right you want me to say it again go back into Exodus they were once the preachers set up the golden calf right and those people were dancing naked around it who put them who got them naked the preachers did exactly exactly who gets the people to lay on the seat of their blind wretched miserable naked and they think they're in need of nothing who has done that to them preachers right preachers are preaching them into nakedness before God where they have where they have no covering exactly do you agree with that man exactly it's the truth it's a preacher's fault you see this stuff going on if there's something going on in the church if this man don't jump on that spirit and get it now he's not jumping on the individual he's jumping on the spirit that's in the individual if he don't stop it on the day of judgment he's going to be responsible for that exactly he's the head does everybody understand that right the man you're the head of the family when things come to your into your house that the message says you shouldn't have it there you'll stand in judgment for that like I told the sister some of our sisters they're divorced from their husband you're the head of the house now Sister you'll stand responsible for that you better step it up if you women here don't have a husband you got kids you better step it up and apply the token right right you have to apply the token that's one of the rules of accidents the token has to be applied man does everybody agree with that okay okay okay let's go down so and I put a moon here I wanted to talk to you about the the seven feasts of Israel do you know it's about it's based on the moon right do you know who the moon's a type of Church what did Brother random say was holding up the Bride of the rapture the Moon she's not where she should be scripture says the moon will be the strength of the sun of seven days at the end do you agree with that so the seven Church ages we have all that they had plus right so we're the light of the seven age plus amen so you know what she is what brother Ram said if you're the light of the son of seven days if I say she is him do you get bugged out I had a message preacher one time I said she is him she said brother animal he said it once I said the scripture says it all over I just read you one right it said but my sister said one liking unto the son of man right who was it brother said that's the bride amen one like the son of man I mean everything looked just like him but he was what was it bride form is over his paps right not gird around his here is a servant like he was when he watched disciples feet so does everybody understand it's it's brought the bride it's Jesus in Bride form amen and that's his coming in this hour okay how's he come to the bride by Revelation it's so simple okay first one is Passover that's the first piece I'm just going to read these real quick Feast of unleavened bread Feast of first fruits counting of the Omer and the Feast of Pentecost the Feast of Pentecost is really the 50th day right so the the Feast of Pentecost includes all the way you start counting from the first the Feast of first fruits to the Pentecost is 50 days but everything in between that we call it the Feast of Pentecost right exactly well it's not 50 here it's 50 here does everybody understand what I'm saying but we call it the Feast of Pitta it's inclusive of all that and we can do that and I'll prove it to you by the scripture why we can do that so you have what they call the county of the Omer you have the Feast of Weeks do you understand if you got 50 50 days right well there's seven days in a week so there's seven sabbaths right seven times seven is 49. exactly the 50th one is fifty right 50 is plenty that's where Pentecost comes from right does everybody agree with that man that's where the day of Pentecost it was 50. right is that right when the Holy Ghost fail everybody agree with that right amen okay then you got the Feast of trumpets okay then you have the day it's one day of atonement right what did Brother Adam say Israel be saved in a what where do you think he's pointing back to man which one of them feasts only say a day exactly he said under the Feast of trumpets what did the Jews Miss right yeah you know what the Feast of trumpets does it calls them back to their day of atonement it's true because when I prove to you and we know we believe it but where are you gonna put in the word right you just go throw it out there and it's a philosophy to you yeah if it's not in the word it's a philosophy exactly you know what if it's not in the word your philosophy your ideas as good as my philosophy and idea that's what we got we got a bunch of preachers preaching well I think we went to a meeting last time with Daniel 70 weeks they'd been given the charter brother Branham they're gonna it's the last meeting we're going to talk about Daniel 70 weeks and the guy gets up on the Whiteboard says this is what I think brother M said then he used the scripture in first Chronicles which is the wrong scripture to use for it not only did he draw the wrong chart he put the wrong scripture with it right and brothers said don't misplace mislocate misquote right I was sitting here and brother Wade was there that's all I could do was sit there wasn't it I sit there going man I was about ready to pop a cork I thought are you kidding me 40 50 years of messy that's as far as you've gone right you don't trust brother Bradham any better than that right well he said seven times if you want to understand Daniel say we go back to Mike sure now they won't even you know you can see the chart out there you'll see it on your website I'd use it when I preach why can't they use the church age chart they use the statue of a perfect man chart we get to use it because they got I thought yeah my idea my philosophy of what he's saying it don't matter what you say it's what the messenger said amen the only way you're gonna stay under this message is to be under your profit exactly it's the highest order is a prophet exactly you cannot get over brother Brandon your revelation will not progress further than is dead that's why I don't like the word Progressive it leaves an open-ended statement but if I say stimulation of Revelation Brethren said that I can read lots of quotes with that right maybe you say I'm picky I am picky I think we ought to say only what set on tape they'll use it on you right oh yeah you're saying only what's set on tape well they'll take a quote over here and argue a quote over here I'm going to show you an instance of me and brother we kind of stood off on two quotes didn't we but you got to have a revelation of what it's talking about or you'll never get it together exactly because brother Adam used that same scripture two different ways did he not right I'm gonna read it to you later because I you know if I'd have said it's morning I wouldn't read both of them they probably read the last one for an interview and you only get what I'm saying you're saying that ain't what Brother Sam was talking about you okay dude you gotta listen to you gotta stay with me today because I'm gonna move okay exactly okay we'll warn you amen like I know the last one is the Feast of Tabernacles brother Brandon said in uh future home no if it's the tavern I don't worry said it I don't have the quote here he said Feast the Tabernacle he said we're now feasting under the Feast of Tabernacle you know why I said that because we're in the seventh Church age where that type starts and finishes when fisa is seven right right yeah does everybody understand it brother babe said we we're in the Feast of Tabernacles in the Millennium exactly there's where your true seven day starts but brother may have typed it as the Millennium which is the seventh day right everybody okay any type that as a seven Church age as long as you use the seven you're okay brother Brandon was a prophet he knew where to start his types and finish them exactly so if you use a type you better start it and finish it where he did or you go too far you'll go beyond where brother Brandon did okay I know everybody again I can see your faces do you realize that your face tells me if you're getting it yeah and right now I'm not worried because it's I'm going to all bring it back together I'm throwing information out on you now and I'm going to gather it back up here in a while okay well I tell my church don't get frustrated if you can't follow me at first just just get in there what I'm saying get it between your ears and we'll get her hopefully God will Quicken it by the time we get to the end of it okay okay and her brother Banner spoke of an eighth one yeah now there's some preachers that have an eight day Doctrine oh yeah yeah you got to see that and you that's the Revelation you got to have because that's going back to the beginning that's going back to Eden if you don't believe this you're lost no I'm not going to believe it all I believe in seven Thunders don't you right way I believe in proves you all proves you is God With Us that's sanctification folks sanctification ain't gonna take you in a Rapture so these big dummy message preachers are preachers if you don't get it you ain't take it around you mean you're gonna take a Rapture of sanctification Isn't that with you farooja means god with you his presence I got more in his presence it's wet I'm a I'm light years Beyond Perugia two Lords are you kidding me yeah do you see what I'm saying they got they got this Silver Bullet a revelation that you're gonna make the right if you don't believe it like they do you're gone but under the Rapture Brothers don't talk about one Revelation does he he covered you ought to go see it it's like when I read the book I said okay there's a revelation I gotta get in here and you read it he's talking about everything so what he's talking about it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and under that is Thunders Church ages Daniel in 70 weeks predestination It's all under there and all that makes one thing the revelation of Jesus that's your revelation you know why do we make this hard so the Eighth Day in Jews in jewry there is no Aid it's seven plus one yeah had brother random said hey he said brother Adam you've run out of sevens remember in future home he said oh no I didn't what does he read he goes back and reads the holy the holy communication part of these Feast people it's back to the beginning so seven plus one eight is seven plus one right so eight is back to the beginning AC turn you ever seen how we write eight no we're into it people exactly yeah right see eight right you see any end of that no there's nothing open in it you know it's eternity right so that that's future home that's about I don't know how much simpler you can make it than that but what's brother Brandon preaching out of he's preaching the feast he reads it every week you think he don't know these things he starts breaking it down for us he's taking the shadow of the Old Testament and bringing it to life giving a revelation for us of what these are I know every one of those feasts and I'm walking right through it Jesus for three and a half years he went to the Passover he went to the day of unleavened Earth Feast of unless Jesus naturally walked through every one of those Feasts remember he said on chapter St John 7 he said this he said are you going to go to the great great feast and Jesus said well you're going down didn't he say that and then it says in chapter 7 it says he said he secretly went down to the great feast now that was the Feast of Tabernacles that's the seven you know when he come the seven Church age it was a secret coming he shows the coming in Revelation chapter 7 under the Feast of Tabernacles in the seventh Church age do you get what I'm saying brother random is taking these shadows and types of the Old Testament and breaking it down to us and giving us the revelation of what they really are so we need to go back these are the feasts of the Lord these aren't Israel's Feasts Israel thinks it's theirs no it's the Feast of the Lord I got as much right to it as Israel does exactly I got just as much right to the Book of Daniel as Daniel's people do he said seal it up till the end time it was we've received this we know Daniel's 70 weeks the seal in the prophecy of it was broke to us God's going to redeem Israel the same way he redeems you the Daniel 70 weeks is no different than what he's doing in the seven Church ages if God redeems you differently does Israel he figured a better way to do it then he ate God he's a man like me and tomorrow I'll fight you don't have to do something I said man I shouldn't have done it that way that's the God don't do it that way when God does something he does it right the first time okay let's go up let's read Deuteronomy 16. I want to show you something just go up a little bit where I get that scripture okay right there whoa Deuteronomy 16 16 three times a year shall all thy medals appear before the Lord thy God in a place which she shall choose in the Feast of unleavened bread okay and in the Feast of Weeks and in the Feast of Tabernacles and they shall not appear before the Lord empty right right you know what you had to do though you had to bring a tithing and offering a tithing right you couldn't come empty the Lord right does everybody understand that exactly you ain't gonna come empty before the Lord right right exactly amen like I tell them if you go look at Future home brother Brandon said this he said that those kings of the nations are going to bring the tithing of the earth out they're going to be a tenth part of all the potatoes the fruit that's out there and they're going to bring it into the city right in exchange for that tithing they're going to get leaves off the tree right guess who's in that city right the bride guess who's going to be the ones that pay tithes here given it will be given hey people if you don't pay tithes here you ain't gonna be in the news you ain't gonna be in that pyramid City go ahead be a hard head go ahead there's no tithing of the New Testament the word tithing means this part 10 that's what you're supposed to give a 10. actually 100 of us Gods he allows you to keep 90. you you Meathead you look at it the wrong way you say oh I Gotta Give no you only give 10. God gave the other night God gave the whole thing and you're only giving back to God 10. so you can't come empty all right you can't come to church empty you're supposed to pay your tithes you see what I'm saying and you pay them here you'll be in that future home and you'll receive ties of those kings of the earth I'm going to let be living off their taters right I'm gonna be living off their fruit they grow out there they're going to be planting and having Gardens out there and I'm gonna be in this city next to Jesus Christ having a great time that's what we're going to okay let's go up a little more let's go we're going to talk about the Passover passover's the first feast and let me tell you I didn't tell the moon does everybody understand the moon goes through Cycles I said it yesterday I want to kind of throw it out there you go you know there's a dark side of the moon there's a dark moon and there's a full moon every month do you know you're the church and you go through your ups and downs every month right the moment's a type of you this is what we do oh brother so-and-so's down we're going to kick him while he's down he's going through maybe a quarter moon or of you know he's all blacked out and you say oh that brother he's in a crowd of her preachers call other people that they're antichrists or they may be just going through a cycle right you can't look at a man and say they're no good right you gotta accept them the way they are even after the New Birth you're gonna go through Cycles in your life right I just went through the middle age crazies I don't like it right I didn't buy a red Corvette but I did buy a red boat I'll be honest with you I want to be young again that's what it's like for a man all right if you if you enjoy being old there's something wrong with you right but I enjoyed being 30 years old I had a blast and you know what the reason I'm excited about this I know I'm going back to that Glory this ain't the final state of me this is just a season I'm going through all right okay so the moon all these feasts started on a uh by the moon the way they start abib the priest goes out into barley field and when he sees the Barley have green ears on it the first full moon after those first green ears appear that's going to be the Passover did you know that look the the religious calendar is set by the moon right right the ready is the bride do you see the Rapture set by you that's why God wouldn't give a day or an hour right because it's where you get positionally placed you all come to a fruition you all have green hairs it's gonna be over you're God you ain't waiting on him he's waiting on you to get right yeah so the priests to go out there and see the green ears he'd take the first fruits he'd take a he'd take a bundle of that he'd take it to the temple and take a rod and beat it he'd Beat It Off the shuck right and he'd have a bowl there with an Omer and omer's three and a half pints yeah and you take that three and a half bites and wave it before the Lord if the Lord accepted it then he'll accept the rest of the crop exactly this is what a lot of people don't understand about first it says Feast of first fruits plural right we always talk about when they waved it on that day you know they took their crop Omer of it every day and waved it over it and you say why is that important every Church age on that day the best of the crop out of Paul's day got waved over the rest of them right exactly they were pulled up well you mean Paul was in a rapturing state and his people he was let me let me give you a hint this is what brother Ram said the token don't come till the evening time do we all believe that exactly see what you always think is she's talking about this day he is let me explain it to you the messenger comes at what Paul was applied the token to that church age which was the life of the word in that hour if it was part word that was the life of that hour Paul looked through a glass Darkly he didn't have the fullness of the word right but Paul was the that message was the token message of that hour and those people under Pauls were the ones that come to fruition and God waves them over the Earth right right just everybody get what I'm saying but remember it's an Homer it's three and a half how long was Jesus ministry when he's here the first time three and a half years what's he what did Paul wave over his people right three and a half year Jesus ministry amen what did all the church say what did Brethren wave over the people three and a half years exactly exactly did he but we know seals were broke that Mighty Angel come there was another three and a half years of ministry there's your Messiah week So when you say that one like it under the son of man walked through the church age that Paul was that walked up and down Paul was Bride for him right right do you agree with that if Paul did not have the token in his hour how's he going to take a Rapture his breath you ever think of that all right all right it's not just the token in this hour right it has to be the life in that hour right how did brother man pick all the seven Church age Messengers they had signs Miracles they were 100 their life was according to the word right they had the token life so the token was applied in the evening time but every one of the messages right right does everybody agree with that so it's the Feast of first fruits it goes not only the day that Jesus rose but there's people that rose out of every Church age pulse groups in the sixth Dimension they come up off the Earth did you be honest with you they've already been raptured right you want the truth I've already been ratcheted scripture says I'm we're sitting together in Heavenly places Paul said we're only waiting for the Redemption of the body I'm already in a raptured state I'm already caught up after the church's AIDS come up hither we're past the church ages I can prove it to you we're fixing it look we're fixing to well the seven that was what Feast of Pentecost did it with the feast what's what after we leave here Where's God going Feast the trumpets his shows were in Pentecost is everybody got what I'm saying right right so literally God's calendar for the time Jesus died all the way to the holy convocation is feast days the calendar your personal experience you got to walk all the way through it you've got to go all the way to the Eighth Day the holy convocation right if you don't walk and experience every one of those days you're gonna come up short somewhere does everybody understand what I'm saying you have that's yours you have to personally walk through it right right through it whatever their portion was they had to walk through it and as God as long as they kept true that everywhere to proceed out of mouth of God in that hour then it was accounted to them they're going to be in the Rapture right but if they don't have a token if they don't have a lamb how are they going to come up on the day of atonement there were seven Lambs given you know what that types there was a lamb in each age right right right they had to have the lamb exactly what is it I tell the church when you say Lamb of God say flesh of God would you do that instead when it says Lamb of God it's flesh right it says Jesus was the Lamb of God he was the Flesh of God does everybody under that was he was not the same type of man you are right he was not born of a woman he was born of a man right right that's why you're you're you're you're born of a woman and your days are full of trouble exactly I'm going to tell you guys something every one of you here if you're born of this church you're full of trouble right if you're born of the son of man you weren't full of trouble the ones that's going to give him the biggest fit is you that go to this church have a church birth but you don't have a birth of the son of man until you get to the birth of the son of man you're gonna be full of trouble right everybody got what I'm saying you're the one to give this man the fits right yeah okay so they had to have a token and look they left on a full moon to pass over you know God was so gracious now they had to go out at midnight did you know that remember he said be ready keep your clothes go in haste he said midnight right let's go boys two million people go walk out and it's it's the darkness of the Moon yeah they'd be falling into houses they'd be tripping over it'd fall into a hole right God says you know what I'm gonna get I'm gonna give them I'm gonna bring that Exodus people to a Full Moon where at least they see where they're going right that's why I said you at the end time you'll be the strength of the Sun in seven days how you gonna trip up if you got the strength of a son in seven days man you can't get any brighter than that yeah we ain't not yet on Earth exactly but the bride spiritually speaking is walking in that light right in this hour amen there's nothing can trip you up that's why I don't worry about calling the preacher into Pullman if he preaches false doctor he'll trick me or my church I said I believe I got confidence in what I preach the word if they preach false Doctrine my people will sit there and never receive it because I've established them in the word picture ideas preacher and it won't go over my church because the people have been taught and you've been taught and you teach the people I told you guys yesterday I mean it I understood it here that's why I said it you guys are the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth the world says you're the off scaring of the Earth you know what the outscaring is it's when you cook food it's that stuff around the edge that you don't put on my plate and you thought in the trash that's what they think you are off scouring but we're the cream of the crop in this hour our natural lives may be a joke to most people I tell our church I don't know this is pretty rough I don't care if you've been married 18 times that don't bother me a bit you get the new birth and it's you're Justified you never did it right but you better get to the birth of the son of man or you're still gonna have that on you that's exactly right I'm not worried about their flesh right I don't know a man after his flesh exactly I know you after the spirit if you've got the spirit of the Living God I know you I don't know your flesh and furthermore I don't I don't even want to allow my flesh I hate it I was born of a woman I have an insulin pump I come here every time I go here I gotta be on antibiotics and my I got allergies about I can only see right now but you know what I'm moving this guy that I got will never Slow Me Down I may go through a phase when I'm down but I have some on the inside of me that never gives up that never comes to unbelief and he keeps driving me home right token read up a little bit where they'll go see Uncle quote right there it's talking about oh little people my brother sister get under that token quickly see don't don't take no substitute don't don't do that don't just imagine it right the most dangerous states you can have is think you've got the only just imagine you got the Holy Ghost you're sitting under sanctification that's the worst place you can be at in this hour sanctification your little bus tribulation wide open right it's this it's the tribulation say it Sanctified ones that go through that sanctification ain't gonna get you in a rapper proves you ain't gonna get you in a Rapture right you could come in the presence of this Shekinah Glory in the present until you get it in you right right you're just coming into his presence right exactly not good enough it's okay with Luther is okay with Wesley it's not okay in this hour am I doing away with justification no but we have a further part of it all right open you stay there until you know that that token well you know what no is faith I know if I touch His Garment I'll be healed was she you know what it was when she said I know it's faith right right I know if I do this I'll be healed I know if I do that I'll be healed right but then said your faith healed me what did they do they had a thought in their mind if they did this they'll get healed they did right because why they had a revelation that's what that's what that's what Paul did his life was all built around Revelation right William Brown's life all about Revelation irenius all of them a revelation that's what brought the signs that's what brought the Miracles right right they these they'll follow them that believe amen you're getting out of order you want the gifts and half of you ain't got to where you need to be yet right you know what I don't want the gifts before I before I get the Revelation exactly right because if I do I can misuse the gifts if you get the Revelation you'll use the gift right right amen the Pentecost got the gift but they didn't get the giver and they had so now they claim that's the evidence so it's a gift to the Holy Spirit right right man people well I'm glad I'm so happy for this message thank you people think we're know-it-alls I don't know at all but what I know I know and you might beat me off from it if I'm standing on the word knock me off yeah right show me your quote or scripture get me off where I'm at and you know what brother man said if I ever preached come up here prove it to me not one person every challenge to you right I make that same challenge at our church right if brother Brandon could do it and he represented the son of man I represent the same son of man if I preach the word you'll not knock me off from it I know I know it sounds I may sound kind of cocky but you know that the token is applied and tell your whole listen you guys want to know if you got the Holy Ghost it's going to tell you right here yeah I had a sister in the church last week brother Jess broke I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost you know what I told her to do go read Hebrews 13. you know what Hebrews 13 is Hebrews 11 is a Hall of Fame Faith justification chapter 12 of Hebrews of sanctification it says lay aside every weight that so easily beset you that's sanctification right see they had a testimony under justification right justification is a worker Grace sanctification is a worker Grace the holy spirit is the person amen it ain't a work it's the whole deal right part part oh does everybody understand that when you have when you have a baby you have water blood spirit what do you got a person right right so if you've got justification secretary's Baptist you got the person of Jesus Christ in you Jesus Christ the hope of glory simple isn't it let's see okay I'm gonna answer you you guys want to know if you got it or not here's your answer right if you can answer yes to all these you ought to go shout them out of here well don't shout after I got a few things I want to say until you're whole half your mind whole the mind that was in Christ is in you until all the nonsense of the world is gone right all of it okay until the whole heart's desire is he becomes number one in your life sister Peggy ain't number one in your life exactly I'm sorry sister Peggy but he loves somebody better than you right amen sister Petty you love somebody better than him over there you know what she's gonna be known as a real Jewel right but you ain't gonna live like a man and wife over there that's going to be your sister right her sister's a higher order than a wife did you know that remember brother Branham is his two the sister me or sister hope he said my precious brother hugged him and went on he was standing there going I didn't feel nothing I felt the same way all them other sisters got a hold of me how was my wife on Earth I supposed to feel something right God was giving him a revelation he showed him the sixth Dimension he shows what it's going to be like over there over there sister Peggy I'm gonna give you a big hug and kiss all right I know that doesn't look too good here but over there I can do that because we ain't going to have those kind of Sensations over there think I'm funning with you I'm not there's some sisters over there I'm going to give a big hug and kiss too but I won't dare do it here because of this nonsense guy I got do you understand what I'm saying okay see that then you know then you know something is happening Jesus said these signs shall follow them and believe after this he didn't put this up here he put this down here not make Believers but Believers see now we don't want to take any chance on it you must do it right brother bear I'm showing you how to prove you got the holy ghost or not exactly he's getting a message he'll tell you if you got it or not if you ain't got it there's nothing brother God wants to give it to you more than you want it amen it's like putting the old ocean in two inch pipe and put it on seeing the pressure that's down at the end of it that's what God wants right you know why people don't have the Holy Ghost they don't want it all right if you don't got the Holy Ghost here of the night you don't want it you know what you're doing you're out there fun and gunning in the world you're all through with the we're on the things of the world your mind's on other things in Christ your central desire is not him you know what most of it is you know what most of your central desires are you right right brother I said the real gift is get you out of the way that's what I thought I I I the eye's been taken out of it for me right it's I exalt Jesus Christ to him only Glory that's where my my exaltation is does everybody understand that okay so this is what he did under the Passover in Exodus when he was coming out when they're coming out of Egypt first thing he had to do was to reveal his name to him so every Exodus he reveals a name to him exactly remember in Matthew 1 17 said Jesus will be born Jesus Capital j-e-s-u-f he's starting in Exodus right there because he's revealing a name to him Jesus right right show me that anywhere else right I will in a minute because it's in the Old Testament you just don't get it but he's in the beginning he says Joshua or Jehovah you know Jehovah's a latinized version of that name the real name is Yahweh all right and Yahweh ain't real because we had the vows to it so we can say it right if you say what that is you can't even say it see the people Jehovah Witness say well you got to be Jehovah Witness you get Jehovah Jehovah you know what I tell them God's name ain't even Jehovah that's a name they come up with they added the vows right that's Jehovah is not the real name that's the latinized grammarized version does anybody got what I'm saying right we'll prove it to you in a minute okay here we go I told Brother Wade he probably preached it did you you didn't that guy's a big man I thought I can't tell him nothing before I come out here you can't tell a preacher nothing you know brother Brandon said he couldn't keep a secret yeah thank God the days The Voice the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery got him he couldn't keep a secret right right God made him that way naturally and spiritually your preacher can't keep it quiet we do some things in private but this message I'll cry from the House Top God gives me a revelation I can't wait to get a Pulpit it's like a fire in my bones it'll drive you crazy until you get ready you think you're going to blow up okay and I appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and Jacob by the name of God Almighty right this is the first this is the second place Jehovah's mentioned the first place Joe with me it's like Jehovah Nissi or Jehovah Jireh he was only known in part the name Jehovah has seven compound Redemptive names under it so what he introduced himself to Israel is in the fullness of Jehovah right in the hour of The Exodus the fullness of Jehovah came into effect I'm the uh I'm the Lord I got to heal up all thy diseases he says he's your banner he's Shalom he's peace God had seven Jehovah was revealing himself as Jehovah the fullness of that name he revealed to Israel now he hadn't before that in Abraham's day it was just Jehovah Jireh the Lord himself certified he showed a portion of it does everybody see what I'm saying in Luther's day he only showed a portion of Jesus that's kind of odd isn't it exactly you agree with that president said they had a dip of the Holy Ghost exactly we have the fullness we got the person here I don't have a dip of the Holy Ghost I have the person of the Holy Ghost everybody understand this is an hour of fullness and that hour at the time of the Rapture at the time of the exit it was a fullness came forth amen it was the fullness in the name of Jehovah or Yahweh let's put it that way in our Bibles you know ours came from Latin then down to King James well the Hebrew one is Yahweh right now y-a-h-w-h but Take the A and the E out and that's what it now can anybody pronounce that can you pronounce any word without a vowel in it no no you gotta have vows right gotta have her you can't pronounce it right they couldn't even say the name but look what the scripture says but my name Jehovah was not known to them right is that right exactly okay look here I'll click on Jehovah it says unpronounced except with the vowel pointings what they're telling you is they had to have the vowels to it right they had to have g j e they added an e the O's and the A's right because without it it's just a four letters does everybody understand that in the four letters you want to use the Latin grammatized way it's Jehovah j h v h can you say that can you say j h v h can you say jhbh you can't they have no vowel in them how can you pronounce a word without vowels I'll challenge you too can't do it but he said that's his name right so they added about this is this is this is latinized right it's where you say it you just read it and say you couldn't say it they couldn't either but he said this is his name right huh let's go down right here 26 3 that quote come up now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is God anybody question that now brother babe said the Jehovah the old reading the latinized memorized version the Jehovah the old is Jesus the new does everybody agree with that now remember this is the Passover this is where they first come out right God was starting to reveal it when they first come out God has to reveal his name to you in its fullness before you can take a Rapture right exactly I will be honest with you Jesus was the fullest of the godhead bodily so what I noticed was in the days of Moses Jehovah the fullness of that name was revealed to Israel and they took an exodus right everybody agree right in Jesus Day Jesus the fullness of that name was revealed to him and they took an exodus in this hour in the hour William Branham did he preach Third Exodus where'd he get it Exodus right he read There once a week most of what he got out of that book because Brethren knew he was another Moses brother Brandon when he read the New Testament knew he was another Jesus right I got news for you you're another Jesus and Bride for him if you don't think you're another little Messiah if you don't think you're a little Jesus you ain't taking an exodus if you don't receive the fullness of that you ain't going out of here the rest of us are going and you're gonna look up David I thought they're gonna be a rapture is that what he said that's what he said I'm telling you what he said the Jehovah the Old Testament is a Jesus in there go forward let's do John 1990. John 19 19. and pilate wrote a title that says here and put it on the cross and the writing was this is not a title is that a title the title is Doctor lawyer right and the writing was Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews remember the Jews read it said he's not our king take it down and pilate said I've said what I said right I said what I said and I'm not taking it down you know between me and you God had moved on him had him put it on there pilate you mean this unbeliever oh yeah he got anointing of the Holy Ghost you could come to this church and get the anointing of what he's saying and then but if you don't take the anointing back out here with you if it's not made flesh it done you no good it never was Quicken that's the trouble of the message we got a lot of guys taking the message out between their ears but they never got it Quicken it never become a part of them that's why 40 years from now they'll fall away because her intellectual conception can't go as high as a revelation brother man said that you said they we got that site where it says this guy's been in a message 40 years dropped out this preacher's message 40 years dropped out I don't care what they were if they don't have a revelation if it's your preacher your piano player I don't care you don't have a revelation you ain't gonna make it out of here you're going to fall off somewhere exactly right you get on the word you get a revelation the word you're established you can't fall off that right exactly Heaven and Earth will pass away but that will pass away your quote quote is going to pass away one day if it ain't been made flesh in you right amen you're just teethly symbol is what Paul said this title then read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus crucified was not of the city and it was written in this right here was written in Hebrew Greek and Latin not exactly you mean that long that sign would have been it would have been signs of you know probably like this on top of where he's at it wasn't that way let me show you go on go up okay right here the 4K tonight Hebrew letters well Yahweh are correctly translated in Roman Latin numbers as yhwh does everybody see that an erroneously translated as jhvh yeah that's the latinized version the Hebrew version is Yahweh there's some religion saying well you got to know the name Yahweh don't they say that you got some you got to be Jehovah's Witness but they they don't realize that Jehovah the old is Jesus knew the Yahweh of the oldest the Jesus of the new so I don't care if you know him as Yahweh I don't care if you know him as Jehovah that ain't the fullness of the name now all right you gotta have the fullest word I don't care if you believe perusian too Lord it ain't gonna do you enough good if you don't believe it all right you gotta have every word right exactly when yahshua you don't say Jesus the Hebrews say yahshua yeah yeah when yahshua died on the cross pilate had the words Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews I just read it right I believe in Hebrew that would read Joshua on Nazareth blemling yahshua is Jesus Greek huh Nazareth is of Nazareth vinlik is the king yehudum is yehudu jodah the tribe from which yahshua descended by taking the first letters of each of these four words we get y-h-v-h you understand or yhvh the tetragamation of this is Yahweh right do you know what was over the cross was the tetragamation of the name Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews did you know that's what was over his cross now let me ask you do you think it ain't right scripture says all Heaven and Earth is named after the name of Jesus right now I'm going to tell you something I'm going to show you something here you'll get it as part of the Passover you've got to get here in the Passover the customer Jew was they take a lamb they take him out in the yard on April the 10th they'd put him on display for four days you know what they would do if you and brother Wade you know they'd have they'd have a house he on his he would have a name plate around it that said Dale you would have a name plate around yours what would you what's your last name Carly what's your last name black so if I went by your yard I would look there and I'd see black slam and we'll say I'm gonna be really crude I like the shock Factor no I'll use it with is yeah I'll make you a saint in him and ain't is that okay so you're like brother black man you look at him it's all white Minnie looks good he's standing up there his ears are perked up he's a good-looking lamb Mary he had to bring the perfect lamb he couldn't be in the Malachi go read it those priests were bringing lamb Sarah didn't have an eye eyes were cross-eyed didn't have any ear one leg missing and the priesthood was supposed to take a perfect lamb right they were supposed to look at they they had to accept the sacrifice it had to be perfect because it typed Christ but what the priesthood started doing they they started taking less than what they ought to what's happening to the priesthood in this hour they're taking less you've got to present your life a living sacrifice I I'm gonna be on we'll just can I itemize some things I'm not going to take you as a smoker as a pastor I believe you're going to get over it you might be smoking today but I ain't going to accept you that way all right I'll let you come I'll preach to you because you got a dirty diaper and I ain't gonna throw the baby away yeah that's what I tell the church some of you got dirty diapers but I ain't throwing you away I'm throwing the dirty diapers away tell you clean up your diapers I ain't gonna put you in little boys pants right come on that's what we do all right now everybody ain't the little boys or little girls pants so everybody ain't got where you're at you're furthering up the ladder but I got news for you if that guy's name is on the book you're gonna wait till he gets to you you better keep your mouth off from you may think they're not doing what you ought to they ought to be doing it don't matter what you think God's got a picture of them they're going to come to that and it may take them 40 years to get there it may took you four years so why do you bad mouth everybody I don't care if you're the preacher's wife I don't care if you keep your mouth off one another because I'll be honest with you you don't know who is or who is everybody I don't know whose name's on the book I know my name I got to see it holy Revelation I got is my personal revelation God don't tell me whose name's on that book other than mine president said you'll she'd be surprised who's there and you'll be surprised you ain't there right so go ahead try to figure out your little Canary P brain and you're gonna get it wrong so I ain't gonna figure it out what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna feed you the word if you accept it it becomes flesh you'll be there if it don't if you end at justification you're gonna have a dirty diaper and Rapture comes and you ain't gonna go I'm just gonna be honest with you guys that's the way I preach it I like I like them playing this is where we're at you got to bring it where you're at right so he got sloppy but they put the name on there well God hung a lamb up on the calvary he put his name on it Jehovah the old became Jesus see that and that's the family name brother Brandon preached how many messages of identification identified he's preaching the Passover you had to be identified with your land all right you had to put your name on that lamb and what I found out the lamb had my name on it I found out one day I wasn't the son of Peggy and Ed weissinger I was the son of God right I was a little Jesus so on the cross he had my name there right when he was on the cross I was on his mind when he was on the cross I was there in his loins exactly and he put it despite it before everybody Jesus king of the Jews and I'm a part of that name right that's why I don't go to Trinity doctor and I go to that lovely name of Jesus Christ King of Claude all right does everybody understand that right so every fullness he reveals the name of what he's working under in that hour right right in Jesus day it was Jesus brother who says Redeemer name right now he's more than a redeemer who right is he he's more than a redeemer Acts 2 38 would say this same God has made him Lord in Christ right you know what we know we imagine this Earth the Lord Jesus Christ right right he's over you he's in you right right he's with you amen it's going to be that way over there amen right he ain't gonna change he's still going to be the same so the Passover is showing where you got to start your walk you have to identify with that lamb right his name is Jesus it ain't gonna do you enough good to identify with Trinity Doctrine right it ain't the Old Testament show me it ain't there right so you got to be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ and we had a prophet brought the fullness of that name is that right and we're identified with that's your Passover Glory you've got to walk walk his possession people is it right you've got to walk through these feast days you got to possess the Passover you've got to possess your unleavened bread you got to pass the first fruits you got to possess Feast prayer because you got to go to the Feast of trumpets you got to go does everybody understand that now your Trump is the seven Church age Messengers were they trumpets people say well the trumpets don't matter you mean the church age Messengers don't matter to you that's your Feast of trump it's the seven Messengers so you walk through it do you understand what I'm saying it's the truth if you don't walk through them you you're you're cheating yourself the Jews had two killers this was their religious killer where they started in abib according to the Moon they had a civil calendar which was your natural birthday you had a contract they put that on the Civil calendar if we had a marriage license they'd put that on it but the religious counter started a whole different curve it it started a religious event at your new birth you come from a natural calendar where you were I was born on 5 16 of 55 I found out I wasn't born then I never even had a beginning all right I'm Eternal I didn't have them again I didn't begin on Sunday if you're if you began on a certain day you're gonna have an end all right Satan was prepared right he had a beginning he has an end devil was prepared for the devil so it's prepared it had a beginning I was in the mind I was the thought of God before I ever come to the Earth God seen me there perfect amen and only there he seen my sacrifice right I had a sacrifice there amen right come on that's what he said all right Glory so see you gotta reckon that Passover is recognizing who you are and who he is hey you're walking right there everybody got what I'm saying so everybody here you got to be in the Passover that's your beginning right now the next one go next let's go to the Feast of unleavened bread I'm taking way too much time Lord I am no I'm not peace the rule of it you couldn't eat a lemon bread for seven days you couldn't eat lemon bread lemon's got leavening in it lemonade makes the bread rise it actually starts the decaying process and I'm going to tell you you girls that do bread you throw leavening in it and it gets it gets big in a hurry don't it see sin Works quick in you once you start letting sin get a hold of your life it'll go quick you'll turn around one day and say how did I get here you get sin in your life it'll go just like that right so a little Heaven Jesus said 11 at the whole lump he said the doctor and the scribes and the Pharisees that was left me right so Jesus showed us there's seven days and there was from the second day Jesus crucified on Passover right the next day that's the Feast of it for seven days through seven Church ages we have to be under that Feast we can't have any leavening if we have leavening in your message it's decaying it's it's bringing death right is that right and G brother Brandon now let me show you everybody heard God's chosen place of worship you know where Brethren got that scripture unleavened bread and we always say well God is where his name is that's a true statement you only got half of it he only puts his name where the unleavened bread is right he don't put his name on a Baptist Church because they got leavening there I'm going to really shock you if you're a preacher this message and you've got 11 in your message God ain't gonna put his name God ain't going to associate with leaven everybody got what I'm saying for seven days seven churches are gonna be no 11 found in your house what they would do the Feast of unleavening they didn't have Candlelight or light they take a candle that go through the house every corner if they found a breadcrumb that was living bread they would sweep it out and burn it right remember brother Ram said don't bring that over into this burn it he's talking about leavening if you bring that Pentecostal message over into this you brought leavening and what message you have is going to spoil so there's preachers in the message that got nothing but a Baptist attitude once saved always say I believe that in the right thing if you place predestination right I believe it but some of these guys got one saved always saved and they've got sloppy Grace mixed in that's Lebanon buddy that's that's going to Decay that thing so you can't bring any leveling into this so God's going to put his name where there ain't no leavening that's his chosen place to worship does everybody got what I'm saying so if if Lula church has any leavening in their Doctrine God ain't gonna put his name there exactly God ain't gonna come and worship here right right because those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth amen it ain't 99.99 right right man it ain't pure it's got to be a hundred percent true all right that's why God put his name here because truth is here and God will not associate with anything less than the truth I don't care you don't scare me when you say you're message believer if you got unleavened in your life God ain't there God is not going to come to your Tabernacle exactly that's not his chosen place he will not live in an unclean Temple that's your Feast of leavening let's go to the next Feast that's easy isn't it and those will get done that quick did you okay Feast of first fruits that's the third day after his crucifixion Jesus rose from the dead you know Jesus was waved over the rest of the crop Jesus came to fruition there was no sin in his life he's showing you that you can come to that right yep if he rose you raise with him but look you got to be in that body by one Spirit you can't do it claude's Spirit can't do it brother Samuel Dale's Spirit can't do it exactly you're subject to failure your body is subject to failure exactly so if I want to get lifted up off the Earth just like Jesus did then I have to not have any leavening in me right right I got to come to fruition everybody okay with that and what they did every day or the county of the Omer they counted from the first Feast of first fruits to the day of Pentecost if they were on the 21st day this is what the Jews did they said we are at the 20 and first day of the county of the Omer and the rule of the county of Omri is if you didn't recognize the day you were on you would miss the day the blessing of that day yeah is that does that does that bring a title to you that brother Brandon preached recognizing your day in this message amen Paul knew the day he was in he recognized the messenger and he was blessed for that day right the ones that are iridius they might have not known who the messenger was president said I doubt they knew the message was since Paul but they knew the message right and the message and the messenger are won all right can I tell you this this message and you were one amen this message ain't different you this message is you may play the message is made flesh in you exactly that's the son of man does everybody understand what I'm saying it's got to come to you you have to walk up and down in these feasts right it has to you've got to walk and possess these feasts or you're not going to be there is everybody okay this is what he took him through to take him to the promised land he's going to take you through these feasts to get you out of here does God change his mind about his word brother baby said he ran a weekly in Exodus he's put Brother Brad is focusing you and putting you on Exodus right right I love it do you like Exodus whether Brad preached a year on Exodus did you know that a year he seen he's seen it okay and the first fruits remember I told you on the day of first fruits they would I got out of order a while ago but they take an Omer a barley barley there's 50 days there's five bread crops that come to fruition first one's barley did you know that then then the week comes after that exactly because that's why it says abib it's green ears The Barley had green ears on it the difference in barley and wheat is barley has no lemon in it wheat does right if you take a flower and you put it in a bowl with water and you let it sit there in 17 minutes it'll start Rising why it's got 11 in it all right you're a type of wheat you got 11. this body is 11. you will not perfect this body you cannot it's leaven that's why you got to wit the Redemption of your body you don't complete Redemption until you get a new body so if you sit here all happy and cushy where you're at in this body I doubt your experience as long as you're in this body you realize you got 11 laying right there with you and you're not going to rest till the leaven's out does everybody understand that that's what he was talking about Paul Paul wasn't gonna rest till he got rid of his body Paul went there did Paul they're going to take his body Paul said I ran the race stuck I don't even know if they ain't tied up knowing Paul stuck his old head in there didn't bother Paul at all he said death where's your sting Graves where are your eviction he was he was happy to get rid of this body I don't know about you but I'm getting weary of this body scripture says the bride is going to say and so Lord come quickly okay your daughter needed okay save them not everybody's gonna be in this Rapture some of you in this room ain't gonna be in a Rapture now there's no reason you can't be yeah man if you don't you're foolish virgin I told him in a church I said you know who you're interested in me is look at the person next to you the Baptist can't touch me no right you know the one who gives him the biggest fit the one setting here all right when he preaches the word and you won't conform to it you're the problem look out there yeah right it's you right man you're the problem right if you come under the if you come in obedience this message then you're not a problem right when he was the best thing you compliment you give him it ain't that car you got him it ain't patting on the back it was a fine message brother Samuel and then they leave here they don't become flesh right you see them go out the back door and do the same stupid thing you just preached right you know what you do you say did they even hear me right you know what we'll do we'll go home crying and say God they ain't even getting what I'm saying right it tortures a preacher when you don't do what he says it's not what I say I'm saying what the message says and we're 40 50 years down the road and you guys still ain't doing the things brother Branham said right people grow up I'm not being mean and I'm not trying to beat you down but it's time we become adults we lay aside our pride we let go of us and get God to where he's the four this message ought to be Uno when you're alive all right the first fruits they beat that three and a half barley no leaven they beat it with rods did they beat Jesus on the back it's a type of that they beat him right then they wave shaved it now the Lord had to accept it you know Jesus had to be accepted that sacrifice when he rose in the garden he said Mary don't touch me I've not ascended to the father did you wonder why you couldn't touch him until he was accepted right man because why Mary was she was born the same way you were she had living she'd have messed the whole thing up she said he said don't touch me I have not ascended to the father he was still doing the work of a high priest you couldn't touch the high priest once he was sanctified people could have gone oh shake my hand brother no he was Sanctified for service he had the blood put on his big toes he applied the blood all over the tavern you didn't dare touch that priest right right that's why the priest stayed on the outside of the door and Pilots oh they didn't go in because if they went inside there they'd have been desecrated they were fixing to do the Passover he was already Sanctified for that purpose right is that true exactly right that's why they turned him over the pilot they didn't want to have dirty hands either they had a law speaking of the children of Israel say to them when you come into the land which I've given to you and shall reap the harvesterof then you shall bring a sheep for the first fruits of your harvesting to the priest and he shall wave the way of sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath right remember Jesus died on Friday right three o'clock Friday afternoon they took his body off the cross at three and buried him before six because that was the beginning of the next day Sabbath began at six o'clock the Sabbath day was Saturday everybody agree with that that's right he said the day after the Sabbath the day that he rose so the first three is resurrection look people if you don't have a resurrection if you don't go through that feast day right you can still believe him no sure you could even be sanctified right but you know what you got to have a resurrection in your life if you haven't experienced threat you got to walk see what I'm saying you have to possess these things right it's just not God just didn't put that in their exes for a filler it's a type of things to come right okay Harvard and you shall bring a sheath the first region of harvest to the priest he shall wave the way sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it so what Jesus was was that he had to be accepted to the Lord and the Lord said I like it there's no leavening in you I like what you're doing right right so there's going to be a crop after us now the difference is we weren't barley there was a difference between Jesus and you exactly you got to admit that right he was without sin there was no leaven in Jesus whatsoever there's no sin right but you do you got leaven in you your type of wheat right in the Feast of Pentecost is when that week comes for fruition and even that wheat that comes up gets waved over because they say this is what this is the best that come out of that crop do you see what I'm saying you're the you're the ones that's waved over you're the best of the crop there's going to be the church down there there's going to be ones that are good to the bride down there they're part of the crop but they don't come up and get waved over it right everybody got what I'm saying the type's there brother ribs seeing these things now we're going to go to the Feast of first they call it the Feast of Fert and see it's fruits plural Feast of first fruits does everybody see what it says it wasn't just one day it was one day but what the county of the Omer if you're in a 21st day it connected you to the first day yeah and if it's the 21st day they were going to come up to the 50th so what they call it is the Feast of Pentecost but it starts the county of the Omer at the day of first fruits every day they took a crop and waved it over it you see what I'm saying every age God pulled a crop off the Earth everybody got the type of that man and you know so with the church by the way I know you'll read in a minute I'll read it to you later when I get Trump but then said we've just ended that long Feast of Pentecost you know what he's telling you how the church ages I'm gonna be honest with you I'm not into church age anymore I'm in a jubilee jubilees outside of the feast that's the 50th day even though it's a part of it it's not in the 49. all right it's the 50. it's a jubilee right because everybody understands there were two different jubilees mentioned in the bible every seventh day was a jubilee every Sunday was a jubilee or at the seventh Year sorry seventh year was Jubilee is everybody right they rested the land on the 50th was a jubilee as a golden jubilee that Jubilee was different this Jubilee this Jubilee you went free but you didn't get your full possession back exactly if you if you sold your land off and you got Jubilee in the church ages you didn't have enough money to buy the to buy your full possession you're going to have to wait till the day of Pentecost to where you get it all back does everybody understand that look you were in bondage working for this guy for a dad but you only paid his debt back you couldn't pay the debt to get your house and every all your land back right so at the 50th Jubilee does everybody understand what I'm saying you come into full possession you got everything back we're here we get everything right Paul didn't get his full possession back Luther I read it they didn't get a full possession the full Productions or witness Redemption of your body we get tired we're in the age of the golden jubilee when all everything we're gonna all look there's no great ones among us at the day of the the Pentecost the Feast of Pentecost everybody in equal had everybody in Egypt or Israel had the same acreage when they first divvied to land up you got 48 you know in Oklahoma they gave the Indians 40 acres so if you were in a tribe they give you 40 44 every one of the tribes they were all the same but the trouble is when they got into the land they got in debt that's the type of sin and they couldn't pay their bills so what they did they'd sell their land off and then after a while they'd sell their kid off you ever notice somebody that doesn't come out of the token all you're doing selling your children off I see you got the token applied you want to hear how you apply the tote brother okay I said that brother man told us detail you got to playing cards out can you say it the funny books Romance Books the TV yeah you say well I need to have a TV and handle it brother Brown couldn't you beyond your messenger you gonna go above him but the rep said he didn't have it he said blow it out shotgun Brother Brad said Remember the the pr the Jew he called a television did Brother Ram change that do you know what brother man said every every disease comes out of the fourth dimension you know where the TV gets the pictures out of that fourth dimension right so if you're getting out of the fourth dimension where's that coming from right you think God's pulling out of the fourth dimension I don't think so you better listen to what he's saying you better get your token applied I'm not gonna throw you away but I'm telling you you got dirty diapers you better get them changed right we're coming now where you better get you better reach your maternity and hurry we ain't playing games down where we're at all right you can explain a quote away if he said blow it out with a shotgun you might ought to do it right and I'm a dead shot with a shotgun I've won several state championships and I you called me up and I'll take a plane out here to blow it out of your front room and I guarantee you I won't miss it that's asking oh buddy I can get them I can practice him blindfolded tear half your house out but I'll get it and the the what I wanted to bring here at the end of that there was leavened bread if you remember there was two loaves waved over them right but it was they had they said there's leaven in them right see we got 11 in us but at the end of the at the end of the the Pentecostal Feast there's two loaves it's Jews and Gentiles you know there's Jews in the bride the early church before 53 was Jews right they were part of the church they're going to be in a Rapture by the way right right right but they're they're they got 11 in them but their way but let me tell you something you know two things that kills Lebanon there's two salt and fire yeah what does the scripture say you are you're the saltier you're the ones that stopped the leavening in the land you're the only ones that can resist Lebanon you stop it you do you're the bride you stop the living and what's fire when you get the bad it's a Holy Ghost and Fire you know what stops the leavening of the loaf in you this guy what stops the sin in your life fire if you don't have the baptism Holy Ghost the fire that'll stop living if you don't have it you don't have the baptism Holy Ghost you can fall off a justification you fall off at sanctification the baptism holy ghosts are sealed you can't fall because when you once you put that loaf in the fire it will not raise anymore when you're cooking that it rises up when it gets as big as you want it you throw it in the fire it won't get any bigger not in the fire because the fire stops the leavening so there's only two things in this earth that's going to stop this leavening of sin we got here the fire god the salt in your life yield the salt of the earth you're going to stand in the way of sin amen you do that's what you think God didn't put you in a big position don't want it's the truth amen but they always preach Ruth in this did you know that go up did I read it yeah I hear it right here I want you to show you this real quick I got to go I know you guys can get mad if you don't get out here at 12. yeah God help me I'm going to Deuteronomy 23 22 a bastard chilling out here to congregation Lord even to his 10th Generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord that's 400 years an ammonite or a moabite shall not enter the congregation Lord even to their 10th Generation exactly shall they not enter the Congress Lord forever right now Ruth entered in she was an Amorite right the Old Testament says you can't go what changed you ever thought of that Ruth had no right to be there you know what brethramp said you should have burned on a servant you don't have a right to be here today but you know what happened to you what Ruth she said let your God be my God Naomi let your people be my people she's ceased being an Amorite at that hour I ceased being the son of Peggy and Ed weisinger when I said God you're my God I'll follow you through tribulation through the good times I'll never leave you and he said I'll never leave you either though so what do they do they read the book of Ruth they're in the Feast of Pentecost right remember Ruth came in there at the beginning of the barley season and she went all the way to the end what did she do what Justified her your God's my God right she quit Jesus to be an Ever right then because they knew her as an emperor or a moabite sorry moabite but they let her come in the children of Israel the priests knew that and let her come in but it's because of her confession her body fold her possessed her confession everybody get what I'm saying right right so if you look at that you'll say the Bible contradicts them no it don't it states in there right right she can she threw the world into things the world away that wasn't a real Ruth the real Ruth believed that Israelite message the real Ruth and that sir believes the message of the owl and that's what they do the Feast of Pentecost she went through justification she served and then she rested when he was doing the work of kids Redeemer she did nothing right she sat in the chair at the house right you know what I'm doing I've interviewed my rest right my rest dated Saturday and seventh day my rest is the Holy Ghost that's what it showed us seventh day there and Jesus brought it to a rest of the Holy Ghost but you got to walk through that and type you gotta walk through Ruth that's the part of redemption see I'm walking up and down the book Jesus was walking up and down to church ages I'm walking up down the bus he is the book and I'm the possessor of the book I ate it it's become part of me right okay yeah I know but I'm running out of time they're gonna kill me and you shall count into the from the more I have Sabbath for the day that brought sheep for wave offering which is the first for seven Sabbath shall be complete right and then on the 50th one was the Jubilee exactly and in that year Jubilee it started on the day of atonement it started on October the 10th right and that priest would get we'd blow the Jubilee trumpet at the Tabernacle first if I'm gonna preach a message I'm gonna go back to Tabernacle and preach it there first and then that priest got on this Little White Donkey and from a year from the time of atonement back to the next day of atonement the next religious year he wrote on that white donkey tooting that horn right everybody that heard it on that 50th year they've reached atonement they blew the trumpet everybody that heard it they could throw their trumpet down go free or they could stay with their master and receive a board through their ear this is that day his brother and preached he preached the day of Pentecost you've got to walk in it you the trumpet sounded he did all three things at the time of his dissension did he voice shout voice trumpet did he do it right you better go through your day of Pentecost and your Pentecost is 50. we're through the church ages that's right I'm not in the church age that's right that's right I'm gonna be honest with you guys I ain't Leo to see you right it's blind wretched naked exactly I'm not in laodicea that's women's rights that's people's rights president said you ain't got a right coming did you always say that in a message you think you got it right you ain't got it right exactly the only right I got that word that's my that's the title deed I want that out there I could give two Hoots for I'll be honest with you so the two loaves are waved over it but 11's been killed out of it that's what we got we're getting waved over at Lowe's it's done it's finished does everybody understand that so in the day of Pentecost is finished right did not brother doesn't say the days the voice of the seven angel will you begin the sound of the mystery God will be finished all the leavens be cooked out brother man took all the seven Church ages right where it was things have been left off he brought the true leaven in this hour the fullness of the word and you know what we've we've we're just it's burned out of us right right there's no leaven in the bride can I tell you that all right it's the truth so there's your feet I'm gonna have to stop it's 12. I told you I'd I'm done come up here I won't quit talking I'm a preacher I get behind a Pulpit I preach so does everybody understand that you have to personally walk through those days Jesus personally walked through them days at Jerusalem and he had a message on go read them I showed the church every feast day and what he preached on them and it matched up with the feast days in the Old Testament Glory exactly he preached there what he preached on those feast days it matched he was showing them that was my feast and he associated with them and you're associated with them down here too and you've got to be possessor of them you've got to be walking through every one of them so that ain't Israel's face God said that's my feast and I'm part of it right does everybody understand all right I'm gonna start on Feast of trumpets next it's heavy right I don't have to hurry I got I got 50 pages of quotes but I'm just gonna do the best I can okay look I don't know at all this guy's a whole lot smarter than I am I can preach I can come here and preach because you guys are really good people you're taught well it's almost as easy as my church to preach at that's easy usually you go out you get nervous I never get nervous here I know I just I don't sister Peggy I feel as home ears I do a church in my appointment because I know the Liberty is here where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty right that's right so I thank God for you I appreciate you letting me preach if you can come back come back if you don't video stream me I love you I really do and I appreciate you it's been a pleasure my body's been sick but who cares I'm just dragging this guy along anyway this guy's just along for the ride we're laying down right like the old golf joke you know Harry died he was out golfing a guy Harry died and he said he had hit the ball drag Harry hit the ball drag Harry that's kind of what I'm doing I'm having fun I'm hitting the message I'm dragging Harry I'm hitting the message I'm dragging here but I'm gonna get through this game I'm going to get to the 18th hole I'm going to finish he said he'd finish the work in me that's right yeah and you know what I believe him yeah God bless you buddy thank you amen just remember it was not leavened bread in the days of Ruth it was The Barley season it wasn't a wheat gather part The Barley okay it's that time because she got those six measures that was Marley but what I liked what he's saying two lows Jew and Gentile there's Ruth there's Boaz perfect on the way right amen amen let's just pray and be dismissed and we'll go and eat and then come back and start right out where he left all the time amen tell our brother how much you appreciate the message Father we thank you we love you and we just commit everything into your hands now we just say Lord thank you for the word we've heard today our brother had to try to be fast and say a lot but yet we believe you believe your word guide us now as we go eat a natural meal come back together this afternoon we love you father in Jesus name amen you're dismissed take the name of Jesus
