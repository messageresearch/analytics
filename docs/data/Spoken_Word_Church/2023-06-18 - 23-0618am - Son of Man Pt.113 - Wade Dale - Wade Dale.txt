that you're staying up there we are paying for that so if you'd like to carpool please do get with somebody that's close by you or somebody that can pick you up but uh the church is not providing that at this time um but we are providing the biggest part and that's most of the food and the lodging all right so uh we appreciate brother Dale for letting us do that so also the Bethel camp what are the dates again I didn't is it up here and run oh MRI what's the dates October what 19th is it that weekend reason I ask is because brother Matthew um approached me at the wedding several weeks ago and and asked for help and I've done it with sister June and I've done it at burley's Camp if you short staff it's bad news remember some of y'all coming and helping us because me and sister June fed 100 people by herself so I would like to if you could participate and sign up to go I'd appreciate if some people from this church would take it upon theirself to go I'm going to try to go since June's going to try to go but they need kitchen staff bad because they've got to do all the meals while they're there and that's several hundred kids not just 75 or 80 or 100 it's going to be several hundred children young adults I'm sorry I don't say children young adults so just keep that in your prayer take the block of time off and go over there and help we uh sister Rachel's kind of um one is going to tell us about it here and and they've already asked her to uh to help so we appreciate if you would help them uh if we pull together the load's a lot lighter amen all right so all mine's clear let's go to Lord in prayer dear Lord Jesus thank you for this day that you've given us father it's a time that we honor Father's Day here on Earth but thank you Father that before the dawn of time you were already a father when you said let us make man in our own image and in your likeness we were made thank you Father for that thank you that we were born again that we have a new life and this life that we live now craves the word of God and it craves going to church and it it has a desire to be to have fellowship and friendship and and just come around Lord and in a sanctuary or even when you're standing around talking Lord you're there in our midst father I pray this should be with the ones that are not here that you'll keep them safe on the highways that you'll be the ones that are sick father the ones that are not with us because of that thank you for the ones this traveled the coming through Lord I pray that you should give them traveling mercies back home forgive us of our sins father and just be with us now as we talk about you in Jesus name amen all right we've been on the son of man and we're going to continue on heading up to the son of man but we're on the Statue of a perfect man and we'll bring out a few things today a little bit uh in addition to so let's read John 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory in other words it wasn't hidden we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten father of the father full of grace and truth all right II Peter 1 verse 5 and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue divert your knowledge and all his Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word First Timothy 3 16 says without controversy in other words without argument without us having to go into acts 13 or 14 000 different people denominations all right there's twelve or thirteen thousand brother Brown said there was 900 back in the 60s well there's 13 000 now if you look it up and I know it's true because it's on I got it off the internet yeah praise the Lord anyway and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so there is a mystery and it is great and it's of godliness and as we've been talking where is that godliness now Colossians 1 verse 21 says in you that were sometimes alienated the enemies in your mind by Wicked Works hello we were all there yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable in other words we have a new father all right we were birthed by our first father and and that we were birthed into death come on but now by the new birth we've been birthed again that's why Jesus said you must be born again birth into Life by our new father or by Our Father the original one all right so now in Colossians it says in the body of his flesh true death to present you he's going to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight all right thereby with me that if you continue in the faith grounded and settled be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard all of you in this building have heard the truth amen you have heard what the world is looking for they're looking for a trumpet they're looking for it to bring God on the same no it's a message and that message has already sounded the trumpet is sounded and you're a recipient of hearing that message and you're also a recipient of sounding that message amen final voice final trumpet to the final age if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and bema moved and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to Every Creature yeah it's hot in here which is under Heaven whereby Paul and made a minister come out now in the janitor well Aaron's not here so that was easy who now Rejoice all right now time back in who now rejoice in my sufferings for you this is Paul talking he's a minister he's ministering this gospel to his people well the word is eternal so he's ministering to us right now who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is what the church he was building the body of the Church of the first church age he was built starting to build this body that God was going to inhabit all right where have I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God now watch even the mystery now here we go there was a mystery of godliness right listen it's a total mystery to the world how you can live Godly but you can right all right even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations so in other words it's been hit but now is made manifest to his preachers that's not what that says that says to all of us to his Saints that's me and you to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you so what is the mystery of godliness what is this great controversy that the world has come upon now that they don't even know what gender they are now you got you know you got the Methodist they split on on the gays and all that stuff now you got the southern baptist the good old southern baptist they're splitting from a group because they're Latin women come in and preach well praise God for the Baptists that are standing strong but listen we don't have to fight that fight oh we have fights to fight in the message don't get me wrong but we don't have those major doctrines to tear our church apart I mean Heavenly days if you if you think anyway all right to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect are complete in Christ where unto also labor striving according to his work which worketh in me mightily praise God for a man named Paul amen but praise God for a man named William Brown amen that brought us the truth all right so now that we can come to Godliness now that we know what godliness is we know as I've been telling you many many times before if you look at the world and and you say well that's an ungodly generation you know what's the most ungodly thing is false Doctrine false Doctrine is the most ungodly thing in the world he hates that he hates that diesel in the Nicolaitans he hates those things that we're supposed to be the great Church of Jesus Christ yet we're worshiping the devil now I'm not talking about us I'm talking about the world the denomination of the world because listen sin is not all the smoking drinking cussing running around all that stuff brother I'm already made that real clear he said the greatest sin was unbelief all right so now that we've been brought the truth and we start believing the truth we can come to Godliness all right which is reverence or respect our piety towards God statue of perfect man brother Brown I took this quote and condensed it down he was talking about godliness and brother Brown said you say I can't do that brother Branham oh yes you can all right now listen what did the prophet come to do he comes to tell us the mind of God he come to tell us what God wants us to know without any filter without any denominational idea he wanted us to know the truth so brother random is preaching the truth in the Statue of perfect man that's all brother round we can't do it I'm sure he's Discerning all over the building and they're like oh we can't do that we can't do this we can't do that and he said oh yes you can then he proceeds to tell us how and here's a hang up deity that word deity we just we just pull away from I'm not deity well the prophet of God said if you have the new birth you are deity okay so deity is Supernatural now you didn't you wasn't born a deity all right you weren't born a deity but you were born in sin but you became into this family of God by the new birth which makes you deity the divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal goodness and powerfulness any supernatural being listen to what brother Brown said he swore by himself let's save reading let's read the red and at the same life that was in this corn down here at the first stalk has ended up here in the ear in the grain just the same it just went on and on and on the same God was in the pillar of fire was in Christ Jesus the same one in Christ Jesus in you do we believe brother Brown was a prophet I just want to make sure we in the right I'm in the right congregation that's right God and you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God he's just a portion of God and what is God God is deity all right now brother Brown in faith the substance 1951 he said deity it fell on the day of Pentecost it's still falling all right so if you say well that was for them well now it's for us if you receive the new birth you received deity you received not a second person of a trinity you receive the person of Jesus Christ in spirit form called the Holy Ghost all right the brother Ryan was talking about now he's moving up to at the spoken words original seat I want to hear what I you know I want to hear what what my father said about me all right I want to hear I don't want to I don't want to have to go to Instagram Facebook or anything and hear what somebody else said about me my father knows me better than anybody all right so this is where brother Branham says the Holy Spirit told him to pick up this pen and write and as sister clean and I were talking the other day he was so inspired he had to go back and read it again because he didn't even know what he read what he wrote that's how inspired that's how much the Holy Ghost took over and wrote this whole summation to me this is the summation of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bringing forth of its kind Genesis 1 11. these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone so it's got to come to The Headstone all right we are headstone people all right we will be the Super Church you said boy we don't look like it now you're just not looking through the right set of eyes we are a super church because we are going in the Rapture if we're born again all that other group out there is not going in the rapture and they're going to have to stay in judgment you and I are not a super race as the nearest The Headstone all right now that's us going up the statue of perfect man even look they will be much like it's like him now what is the divine nature of God that's what we're looking at now this whole statue of perfect man this is the divine nature of God but it's now not to the divine nature of God that we can't get to it's the divine nature of God that we're required to have all right remember I read you long long time ago in Sherman like 20 something out of 130 we're on Earth 113. he said it's required these virtues are required they're required to what they're not required to be a a Christian you can get born again and stay a baby but who would want to who would want to somebody who's been in this message for 30 years and still be a baby I wouldn't I wouldn't want it I mean as much as trouble as Josh did give us uh he's not here right now I wouldn't want him to stay a baby I wanted to grow up and be his own self you know what he's the father now I want him to be that that's a desire it's for him to be a father and have his own have his own family and not be living with us praise the Lord so anyway y'all remember that young kids young adults it says leave and cleave they will be one they will be in this very image how are we going to be in the image of God if we don't look all right in the in the order to being united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God now look this is the holy ghost telling the prophet to write to me and you so this is the Holy Ghost talking to me and you today this is your love letter from your father because the father and the Holy Ghost is the same person all right everybody with me then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a version of his word and through them and by them now wait through them and by them all right so it's got to come through us the great mystery of godliness that comes to a group of people that were born in sin that didn't have a chance we'll be fulfilled all that has been promised promised for his word a virgin who man-made Creed or dog God had to send us a prophet he sent us a prophet not to change the Bible to make sure that we understood the Bible was written one way not 900 some different ways one way and we got away from that and I'll read it to you in just a few minutes when we start talking about Doctrine because listen everybody's got to have a Doctrine every Church brother Brian said you're not a church without a Doctrine all right so we gotta have a Doctrine The Word of Promise in himself like it wasn't Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that's been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb in other words Jesus fulfilled she's going to make so many hundred scriptures while he was here well that's what me and you were to do we're to fulfill how many scriptures we fulfilled my you can't even count how many that the Bride of Jesus Christ is already fulfilled and God and going to fulfill all right praise the Lord that's what makes us the word that's what makes us the word made flesh all right type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be unto me as thou has said though it was said by an Angel while yet was written word Isaiah 9 6. in other words Isaiah 9 6 was written back in the Old Testament but an angel came to Mary and said you're going to have this child a virgin and then she said be it unto me according to that word all right they will love him love his and will have his potentials now we start talking about this word love and we're going to talk about brotherly kindness or Brotherly Love in just a few minutes that love is different that love is not lovey-dovey lovey dovey amen it's not filio love when you get to Agape Love and I'll read it to you this afternoon brother Ram talks about when you get to agape love everybody says well God is love God is love Yeah God's love but God is still a judge him he can't go past his word you have to stay in the confines of his word you get outside the word of God guess what you get you get judgment yes right and it ain't nice and it ain't pretty because you know what God Said in his Bible I hate oh you're quiet Revelations he said the Deeds of the nickelodeans which I hate huh God said oh wait a minute God's a jealous God wow this lovey-dovey person just love everybody Come As You Are I drove by Church coming up here and I'm not judging them I'm letting them judge yourself but the kids was running around it looked like it was school time I mean the Hell in the shorts out on their hats had on t-shirts I mean you know they were and they were going to church that's not godliness you and I are godliness all right they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head the headship of Christ was his notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see now if you stop right there he said well okay brother Brown said Soul the bride what so will the bride have harmony with the father and Christ same person and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it now remember this is the holy spirit writing to me and you nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah he wrote that himself here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word so when we come to Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience that knowledge is what knowing what to do with the word of God not knowing how to show how smart we are somebody say Amen it don't puff you up that knowledge does not puff you up that knowledge will humble you that God was would come to a simple group of people and open the word of God to us and it'd be in our time and in our season see where brother Brandon was there there was a time and a season for them in that Pentecostal age but remember in spoken I mean in The Sixth Seal on questions and answers he said you're not getting this it's not for you in other words it was for us they heard the sound but they didn't understand the Bible says if the trumpet makes a what uncertain sound because remember that's the only way they can communicate back in the Old Testament if you had an army way over here and you were part of the West Wing of the army that wasn't any cell phones and it wasn't even the time to do smoke signals you blew a trumpet and whatever the sound of that trumpet was Retreat charge whatever more you listen to that sound of that trumpet and if the trumpeter gave a wrong sound guess what if it said retreat and the sound was you go forward you'd be in bad shape well that's what's happened to the word of God the word of God came through the trumpet called the Lord Jesus Christ amen the trumpet and then man has what changed the notes come on man has changed the nose God didn't change the notes man changed the notes so it made an uncertain sound during the church ages but now in the end time right here he's telling us he's bringing it back Center he's bringing it back so that we can understand it he's bringing it back so that we can not be different but be different the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ who know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it's germatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose they do only his will amen I'll believe that no one can persuade them different now we've been talking about godliness and we've been talking about patients and all the different things it's going to take every bit of that though for us to as we were talking about the other day about the the sore of the seed falling into different ground well that's your ground today today you either brought Stony thorny ground you either got a in a fight with your girlfriend wife husband who else monument and you brought some Stony ground in here you brought some rocks hard rocks in this building but some of you brought good ground some of you brought good ground and that seed's gonna fall in that good ground and it's going to sprout up and it's going to give you Revelation and it's going to help you through amen so let's get rid of the Stony places let's get rid of the thorny places all right that and it's you that it's you that brings the dirt in here hello somebody it's you that brings it in here all right they have thus said the Lord or they will keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself and them continuing his word to fulfill as he did completely in his day in other words it's going to be in this day all things when he was here he did not complete all though when he was here fruit was not time yet why the bride wasn't on Earth his natural body was on Earth but his spiritual body was not here his spiritual body only started on the day of Pentecost 11 days after he ascended everybody with me so that's why the Holy Ghost said to me and you that's not a third person second person that's not even me I'm reading exactly what the Holy Ghost told the prophet of God to write to tell you all right to the doctrine which is according to Godliness so there is a doctrine that we must be under to take us to Godliness and to brotherly kindness because that's the two tough ones because they're right up here at the very top all right I got this off the internet so again Jeremiah must be true all right what is a Doctrine in simple terms Britannica dictionary definition of Doctrine a set of ideas or beliefs that are taught or they are believed to be true all right so now look we all have a Doctrine did you know that Jesus had a Doctrine what was Jesus's first Doctrine go look there what was Jesus's first Doctrine brother Ryan said it many many times Jesus's first Doctrine out of his mouth was you must be born again not you need to be or you might can you must be born again so brother Ram in 1961 says now God bless his word and I want to take the subject this morning of Jesus's first Doctrine and the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine now in a way of Sunday school so that I won't preach and horse myself up for tonight I thought in my heart that this is something that seems puzzling watch this puzzling the new birth and how to get it brother mom said it was most ill top subject and I believe it still is the most ill-taught subject it's not that you come in and sit down in a message Church you got to know Jesus Christ when you know Jesus Christ he'll bring you into the church you won't have to be begged poor prodded or or Hawk Titan drug in here right you'll come to your own free will because you know what you come to talk to your father your real father he said I thought it would be good this morning if we just search this subject clear it out and that's the first beginning you must be born again it's a very deep one and we find out that there are so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again all right all churches say You must be born again all right now but not any church outside the message of the hour that I know of teaches that once you get born again that gets you started not finishes you it's not once saved always saved it's once Born Again always born again you can't get unborn again all right like I said before last Sunday remember you can be saved and not born again but you can't be born again and not get saved you got to come through that but you can stop yourself at saved believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's not the new birth don't get quiet on me that's not the new birth that yes you started in justification saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost is what this church doctrine believes in we find there's so many different meanings that people put to nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretations to that what it means to be born again I might go to the Methodist church this morning they say we believe this you must be born again how do you interpret it I go to the Baptist Church you believe you must be born again how do you interpret it and I will go to each church and we'd find if we went to all 900 different denominational churches there'd be 900 different interpretations so seeing that there are so many different interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine there must be and is a truth somewhere same way with us our Doctrine in this church is you must be born again you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost to receive the new birth because you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh and in your spirit realm and die and go to hell you can be just as black inside as the Asus page amen that's what anointed ones is you better know that you know that you know that when that unclean Spirit goes out he stays out you seal that thing up so nothing can get in and nothing can get out not just believe the message or believe God sent a prophet or free brother Dale or Breathe by the way and we believe what do you believe I tell you what you're going to prove what you believe regardless it's like I said many many times before you whatever's inside of you is going to come out you can suppress it years and years and years but all of a sudden it's going to pop its ugly head up or it's going to pop its real good head up one of the two so restoration of the Bride tree brother Ryan was talking about the Palm worm canker worm and all the different worms that was eating this tree down but I watched what they said this little fella started to destroy destroyed what canker worm got to bark Watch what it did began to destroy the bark what did it do it made a natural church for a spiritual church and that's what we have out here we have a natural Church they go to church they do good they give the missions they pay their tithe most of the time they do good work but that's not what all God wants he wants a holy life and something to go with that all right he wants us to be in his very nature it made a natural church for a spiritual church yes sir it took away the true wake up he took away the true and give it a false who's he God didn't Satan did the fruit the Pomer wore meat the leaf the locus eat now the bark the covering the religion the doctrine the doctrine the canker worm God where did that first Doctrine come from outside of the Bible now Jesus's first Doctrine was you must be born again that's in the Bible all right but outside the Bible who started their own Doctrine was the same guy that stood in the Garden of Eden and put that word not in there God said You shall surely die he said You shall not surely die you historians you know where it came from from Rome exactly where it started there they started accepting dogmas why did you put that in there by the way our Doctrine has got to be that we go up that statue of perfect man that we come to the love of God and that the Holy Spirit seals us as a unit not just come in and sit down and and and you know suck on our thumbs and and eat our uh eat our uh green Pete mashed up green peas and wow no I like meat I got me a pork steak I'm gonna eat just here in a few minutes you know why my teeth will allow me to do that even the ones that are false right now so but you know why we're meat eaters and even in the spiritual realm we're meat eaters we're eagles eagles eat meat Eagles does not drink milk eagles eat meat the baby eagle does not start drinking milk it's only one of the four beasts it doesn't all them four beasts three of them start with drinking milk the eagle starts with what Mama chewing up the big pieces and putting them in the beak in the mouth of the baby eagles then guess what that baby eagle you don't see a 40 pound baby eagle in a nest I promise you that Mom doesn't kicked him out so that's what mommy Eagles done or daddy Eagle he done kicked us out and we're gonna have to fly on our own all right so we got to have a Doctrine though and our Doctrine is we must be mature Christians somebody in this world is going to be a mature Church a mature Christian that knows what God wants done that goes and reads that and says father that ain't nothing but the truth you you told us you picked your you picked the pen up and buy an anointing you wrote something on a piece of paper with a hand of a prophet and he read it to us and now what our responsibility is to live it pum Warren Caterpillar if it so happens that you your church doesn't believe or you don't believe just the things we speak of in our church doctrine we trusted it will be no means bringing the fence because the very first step to a successful Christianity and to show that man has received the Holy Spirit is humility real god-given humility that it must be given humbly but yet a church without a Doctrine uh but yet we're not supposed to be jellyfish we're not supposed to just roll over and play dead we're supposed to what what Paul tell us we're supposed to give a reason of the hope that lies within us not that brother Branham said I want you to be able to say I say I don't cut my hair because the Bible says not because the prophet told me I don't drink because the prophet said it he didn't come to bring us that he come to sharpen our pencil he didn't change the way to be born again he was exactly the same way Paul and Peter and James and John all preached it in the first church age they preach you must be born again so but a church without a Doctrine is like a jellyfish it has no backbone so our church with the backbone believes that you got to be a mature Christian for God to be able to use you a hundred percent you can bring forth you can bring forth 30 if you want to you can bring forth 60 if you want to or you can bring forth a hundred if you want to all right so we've got to have backbone in it and not also backbone but teeth because the Church of God must eat the bread of life Romans 1 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth how many times you talk to people about the Lord during the week how many times do people wonder by your actions if you know who the Lord is during the week hmm you'd be silent all you want to that's okay think about that though Genesis 1 26 is God said let us make man our own image so he's developing something made in His image and in his likeness now we're made in the image of Samuel and Peggy Dale me Terrence Anna all right all right we have their DNA we have their genetics right so we're made in there in their image and our likeness and we we walk like them we talk like them but that's our natural birth our spiritual birth we're not supposed to walk by natural anymore we're supposed to walk by the spirit which is a different walk we're supposed to walk like this image tells us to walk that's why this Genesis 1 26 is so important because that's your new birth so what comes to your new birth the image of God the image that God saw of you before the foundation of the world which he loved so much he brought this one together with this one and this one with this one this one listen to get you here and now what the prophet of God said to get your DNA here your genetics here so that he can work on you in his likeness by the new birth so God created man his own image this is where it was supposed to be this is where it was supposed to come we were supposed to come this way not by sex but by Spoken Word we were not to come by uh sorrow and heartaches and trials and and and hurts and tribulations and all that stuff we weren't we weren't originally made for that hey but to fulfill the plan of God he let it happen and that tore us away from God that took us away from this image and put us in a human image but God said hey don't worry I haven't left you I'm gonna come back in the image of my father Hallelujah I'm gonna come in the image of my father because I got all these kids inside of me that sexually I'm not going to get out because that's what's killing you already no I'm gonna come as the woman's seed come on I'm going to come as a woman seed by my father and I'm gonna make you a way to get back to this buy the new birth male and female created he them and what happened it's a new birth that's what happened that image that God saw before the foundation world that Eternal image of you came to you and as we were talking it vulcanized with you and you can't tear it apart but now can it can rubber vulcanize with rocks nope rubber has to vulcanized with rubber you have to have a desire in your heart that God changed your heart remember we were born with a Stony heart according to Ezekiel and he had to give us a new heart which is not the new birth he gave us a new heart which was pliable so that God can as the master Potter he can throw us on the wheel and make another image but you can't take a rock I've watched them do Pottery all my life I live around pottery they never have took a rock and put it on that wheel turned it on and here they go now it's still a rock but you take that you take that pliable clay throw it on that wheel and the first thing you do you get a little water and you start like this and you think man there's no way that's going to be a five gallon jar because there's only a clump about like this there's no way you're gonna act like God but the Potter has a different story The Potter has in an image in his mind well praise the Lord stick your hand in Lord so that's the first thing they do they stick their hand in they go down so far but now Sister Regina they don't go so far to where they don't mess the bass up somebody get this they don't mess the base up base stays the same then he comes like this and he brings that and if it comes in and out he just moves it with his hand get some more water and they wash by the water of the word he gets the most water amen and he puts that thing and he makes it pliable and man it is amazing what they can make it is amazing what you can get from a clump of clay well listen if man can do that what about God what about a Godly image that we're supposed to be in give him okay give him your clay and let him mold you into a Godly image man that'd make those strawberry jars and then make it and make the lip and then even make the lip part that would go out to where the water would flow right through that one part all while that thing's spinning and guess who's spinning the wheel they are full control you thank you and you know what if you spin that thing too fast if it starts wobbling now well I have watched some Potters if and they're all kin to Terence and they um they they start and start over here and they put too much pressure and they get when he gets to wobbling it falls off that's his kinfo guess what they have to do though They Don't Throw the Clay Away thank God for that song They Don't Throw the Clay Away he just goes right back and says hey you you missed that first trial up buddy we're gonna try you again we're gonna put you on the wheel we didn't give you enough water in other words you you might have got under the pressure too much and you got a little wobbly well praise God so that Godly image only comes from God but he comes through you you've got to be the one that lives it you've got to be the one that shows this godliness so is it attainable yes it's attainable the Bible talks about Godless the word Theos which is a deity so here we go back to the deity part whatever can in respect be likened unto God or resemble him in any way God's representative or vice region magistrates and judges second Timothy 3 verse 11 says persecution afflictions which came unto me in Antioch and Iconium and a live stream what persecutions I endured so guess what you got to endure some persecution but I didn't finish my story you know what happens when you get finished with the pot they're not finished with it you can't put anything in it at the moment come on somebody fill it up with water and it and it be just sitting on the wheel it's gonna go why because they hadn't been put in Fire yet it hadn't been putting fire yet and we used to unload them things you'd have to put on big old gloves your tennis shoes would stick to the floor that's how hot that thing got but you know what you put those pots in and you just really I mean boy Joe Craven would Bust Your Hide if you broke one of them things because that was a dollar and fifty cents out of his pocket probably out of yours too but we set them things in there one at a time and you'd stack them up one upside down one or the other in this kill and you walked in the ovens on both sides right here you fill that thing up and then you walk your way out to the end and you seal it up I'll seal it up then you turn the heat on well when uh he got when he got finished you didn't have to go in there be so gentle you had to be a little bit but not so gentle you could grab two of it four at a time because why then they had hardened into a good Christian that liability had become what the Potter wanted it to be not just something that's wishy-washy all the way back and forth and back and forth no something that can be used Joe Craven made Millions selling them things as Bob sits Wednesday ten thousand whirls that's what your Soul's worth not just one one would be good enough ten thousand Worlds the prophet of God tells us persecution convictions ovens trials tribulations but out of them all the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we know that's the end time all right so we can live godliness we can be Godly as I said before you think I'm nothing your sisters you're the greatest testimony I mean when I walk into Walmart with my tennis shoes and my blue jeans and and they don't have holes in them where's Dana they don't have holes in them we used to send them well Mama used to throw them away if we were called the brother Kylie because it right we caught with holes in our britches uh we got holes in our britches all right hey now they bombed for a hundred dollars a piece with holes in them I should have kept all mine and sold them this world is not my home look at the craziness though how they're dressing but see we've we've come out of that we don't have to go to salon and get our hair done and our nails done well some of y'all do nails done we don't have to go and you know open up the cabinet and then you got like five thousand dollars worth of Mac Factor all different shades and sizes and in that Max Factor Max Factor yeah open up thank you open up what did I say oh sorry anyway I have my coach with me today but you don't have that praise God I always I always said I said you look at the world and there's some beautiful girls in the world but they're all made up I'd hate to see Dolly Parton at seven o'clock in the morning he'd be like that song we played the other day about side by side there was more the woman on the chair than it was in the bed because she took her eye out she took her hair date out shook her leg off took her wig off and her teeth out yeah well that's what the world looks like to us though they want to be so beautified and so put together talk to me it's ugly and you know who you know it's worth maybe I'll wake up some of y'all are still asleep but that's what the world looks at and says well that's beautiful I don't it's ugly because it's like Daddy always said you can paint a barn you can paint an old barn with fresh red paint but the old barn is still underneath that now that's filming your pastor now he said that for years but praise God listen we've been come we've lifted out of that amen we don't have to do that we don't have to go by the fashion of the world I'll give myself a hand clap if you love the world and the things of this world the love of God is not in you I didn't say that the father said that we have to be in the world we have to rub shoulders with the world but remember I read you that scripture the other day in Saint John 17 Jesus did not say I'm going to take you out of this world and put you in a bubble he said father they're in this world so I'm going to pray for him not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the world that's what our protection is from the word of God I mean you ever thought about that I mean thank God that that our sisters don't have to buy 500 of worth of Mary Kay and Lord you know I work for the Post Office and it that thing comes in on a monthly plan I think you know it's Mary Kay comes in and she's got like 50 packages and I'm like man how much is in packages they could be 50 25 150 brother John praise God sister Alicia is not on that list hey man see because that's not on Mary Kate if you buy me a k that's your business but my wife don't need it she's beautiful from the inside out and that's all I worry about it I was looking at her the other day she's so pretty you know brother Brown told us he said we'd all get old he said you'd remember when your shoulders was all squared you know and uh your wife was all beautiful fresh he said but when you get older you still need to see that the beauty that comes from within first amen praise God that's why we were talking the other day about love there's a lot of people in this world do not know they say I love this well I do I use this I said I love to hunt Jeremiah I love to hunt well now love is compared to what okay compared to the love of God if I hunt if I well church is going on I feel a little different so let's continue on but praise God that we don't we don't act like the world we don't even think like the world right Regina thank you Jesus I mean if I had to act that way to make it I'm sorry just wouldn't make it let's talk about brotherly kindness well well see then we're on the path to Godliness all of us your sisters your brothers even the brothers you know you don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about your liquor bill or your tax bill they're going to eat at a restaurant man it costs still start bro John it costs 20 or 30 dollars a piece almost now to eat a meal and found it in your budget you're in trouble but what about them people sit and drink three four five drinks before the meal thank God that's not on my plan you know why it goes number one is stupid number two it's not my desire I don't care if they go up to fifty dollars a drink what does it matter to me I don't care if they go up to fifty dollars for a case of beer who cares see what you've taken yourself you say well that's kind of little little as much when God is in it labor not for wealth of Fame there's a crown and you can win it will go in Jesus name Broadway kindness let's talk about this just for a second and we'll then we'll close for the afternoon everybody all right y'all get you nap in between services are y'all gonna be in trouble this afternoon second Peter 1-5 besides this in other words besides the new birth besides being born again besides the beginning to act like God giving all diligence add to your faith first Universe your knowledge and knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and the godliness we've come now to brotherly kindness and I'm going to tell you something this is going to get tough all these other things are inward okay all the faith is mine virtue is mine but you give it out but it's mine knowledge Temperance patience godliness is what's inside but now brotherly kindness is something you got to give to somebody else brother kindness is something you got to give to somebody else because you gotta love your neighbor the same as you do yourself well get quiet because it's going to be in just here in just a few minutes you know Jesus said one time he said while you're praying while you stand praying forgive he said because if you don't you won't be forgiven of what you're praying for wow hmm Philadelphia brotherly kindness that's the word for Brotherly Love brotherly kindness It's Love of brothers or sisters Brotherly Love in the New Testament it's a love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren and we know that's not the same love for a wife that's feel your love agape love is brotherly love everybody with me it's supposed to be anyway sometimes we get it all convoluted and it all comes down to something else all right so Philadelphia love his Brethren loving brothers and sisters look in a broader sense love me one like a brother love me one as brother Donnie always said my family this is your family and and praise God if your family is physically sitting here but if your family's not physically sitting here this is your family I'm talking about blood all right this is your family this is the one you're gonna spend eternity with not that one all right now look God is love but love typically produces obedience now watch I thought I'd throw this in here this is kind of a few quotes from from a few places but God is love now God is love agape love right God is not feeling your love God can't feel your love God can't lust God can't have filial love God is agape love and that's it God is love but love typically produces obedience now look and for all who refuse to repent and believe in Christ they receive Justice which is true for those who do trust in Christ they receive what they don't deserve called Grace and have withheld what they really did deserve Mercy which side are you on do you have eternal life or do you still have the wrath of God abiding on you you know if you're born again today the wrath of God will never touch you if you're not born again today you are under the wrath of God all right I'm just telling you what the Bible says Matthew 24 12 says and because iniquity shall abound what is Iniquity no one to do better and you don't or knowing to do something then you don't do it and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold have you not seen that in this end time it's all selfies and we'll get to that in just a second maybe real quick First Peter 1 22 says seeing you have purified your souls Sauls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeign or love that you can't contain unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed or Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth in the Bible forever that word fervently sincere undistinguished brother I'm saying You must be born again said anything had a beginning had an end so see every love had a beginning except agape love anybody with me because it listen if God Loved You at the beginning he can't unlove you anywhere else because he can't change his mind all right so we've got to get up into agape love he led us and allowed us through Adam and Eve and what they did he allowed filial love and for us to have love for our wife love for our but still even feel your love has it has like levels you can't let I can't I don't love Deanna back there she's my granddaughter I'm sorry I'd shoot every one of you for but I love my wife different than I love my granddaughter but it's still feel your love then we know what it goes down to it goes down to all them other things do you ever think of that God the Great Master rainbow in the sky with seven spirits of God read perfect love after that comes filio love from agape love to feel your love that's the love that you have for your wife if some man would insult her you'd shoot his brains out see I wasn't very harsh brother Brown would shoot brains out see because it creates a jealousy but that filial that's filial love secondary love then comes lust for another man's wife then comes filth and we see that in the end time see it just becomes perverted but all of this kind of love had a beginning but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning and it will have no end yes you are then a Son of God a daughter of God in your affections or on things above feel your love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference like bro Dale somebody asked him one time a long time ago said would you shoot somebody if he's intruding in your house would you shoot somebody he said yes I would he said but I pray for him till the paramedics got there right shoot first pray later foreign I've never done that and everyone in his house without announcing who I was was going on to baptism of the Holy Ghost 1958 let me read this and then we'll close musicians get ready to come and then the first great spirit of God which is love God's like a great rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like look at the perversion in the world what they've turned the rainbow into those are seven colors of God those are the seven uh spirits of God those are the seven things that God give us as a covenant and the world is making it some garbage LGBT and all that other stuff they're doing they've used a rainbow well I think we ought to take it back then again the first great spirit of God is love God's like the rainbow we couldn't imagine what he looks like but just say he looked like the rainbow in spirit the perfect Spirit of love red blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship just all perfect spirits and then you begin to condescend coming down and they come all the way down from filio love or agape love to feel your love and on down to lust and on down to the lowest and then God himself became a man Jesus and came down that same way to the lowest pits of Hell picked out those who he knew before the foundation of the world the Genesis 1 26 crowd the born-again crowd all right whose names were written on the book and redeemed them back to itself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and stand in his likeness listen the full Plan of Redemption will not be understood until we get that Capstone when we get to The Headstone that's when it will happen and we'll go through this just a second we'll I don't need that let me read this down here real quick and then musicians come on everybody let's stand that's how much I had to miss don't look up it'll make you sick we're going to talk about that this afternoon we're going to get to this I said we get to it today but we're going to get to selfish because you can't have brotherly love and be selfish selfish means to be selfish is to be concerned excessively and exclusively with yourself selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and inspiring relationships with other people that many of us desire let me read you what the prophet of God said about this 19th this is 1950. not 2023 brother Brown said the people has got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a little world by their self you know that's the truth all right listen to this this is where I wanted to get to but I'll read it this afternoon but now this is your prophet 1954. he says I recognize the other day a selfish Spirit coming upon me oh a prophet he got a selfish Spirit I'm just reading what he said don't don't criticize me I'm reading exactly what he said a selfie Spirit coming on me saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong we'll talk about the rest of it this afternoon we'll get to that part hey man you love the Lord let's don't be self we got selfie sticks we got selfies we want to show ourself guess what you're gonna show who you are I'll promise you that without a without an Instagram or Twitter or whatever that you're gonna show Who You Are because this is
