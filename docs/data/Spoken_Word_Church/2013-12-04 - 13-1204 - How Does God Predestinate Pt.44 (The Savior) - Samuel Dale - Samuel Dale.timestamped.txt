[5:24] Romans 8.
[5:26] and we know that all things work
[5:27] together for good to them
[5:30] that love God to them who are the called
[5:32] according to his purpose for whom he did
[5:35] for no he also did predestinate to be
[5:38] conformed to the image of his sons he is
[5:41] a process in your predestination
[5:44] it's not just this oh we got you know
[5:47] there's a process
[5:50] conformed to the image of his son that
[5:52] he might be the firstborn among many
[5:54] brethren for whom he did predestinate
[5:56] then he also called in whom he called
[5:58] him he also justified in whom he
[6:01] justified let me also glorified what
[6:04] shall we then say to these things if God
[6:07] be for us
[6:09] who can be against us right okay look
[6:12] over to Luke 2. thank you
[6:16] we'll begin reading with verse 8.
[6:19] just to get the point for tonight
[6:22] and there were in the same country
[6:24] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[6:26] watch over their flock by night and lo
[6:28] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[6:31] the glory of the Lord Shone round about
[6:33] them and they were so afraid and the
[6:35] angel said unto them fear not the whole
[6:37] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[6:40] great joy which shall be to all people
[6:42] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[6:45] city of David a savior which is Christ
[6:50] the lord you may be seated the Lord had
[6:53] his blessing upon the reading of the
[6:55] word
[6:56] now
[6:57] trying to get to a point to get back
[7:00] into our thoughts of predestination and
[7:04] I hope that what we've been through has
[7:07] been trying to bring some things to that
[7:09] and bringing it to that point we're glad
[7:12] to have our visitor back there with us
[7:14] and I think this is his first time being
[7:16] here and we always say welcome when you
[7:18] come as a visitor you get a welcome one
[7:21] time and only just part of us so we
[7:24] don't have anything to join we're just
[7:25] part of the body of Christ let me just
[7:28] pray that you'll have a good time with
[7:31] us all right
[7:32] now talking about our Sunday ideas
[7:35] Sunday afternoon I just preached a
[7:38] message I didn't
[7:40] um
[7:41] I didn't use uh any quotes
[7:45] or anything I just tried to bring
[7:48] the the thought to you as to one message
[7:51] from the beginning of the foundation of
[7:54] the world back there before the world
[7:56] ever begun and bringing it down and
[7:59] coming through and coming through the
[8:01] Old Testament and coming out to Jesus
[8:03] Christ and then I went on through as
[8:06] just a little just clicking a little to
[8:08] where we'd have an understanding of
[8:11] The Plan of Redemption and then coming
[8:15] out into the end time to see uh you know
[8:19] where we are and are part of it
[8:22] all right and that's that's more or less
[8:24] what I was trying to bring is just put
[8:26] it into a one message thought to where
[8:29] we could uh could just look at it openly
[8:31] without reading a lot and saying a lot I
[8:34] hope you enjoyed it but I pray that the
[8:37] Lord would help us all right
[8:39] now
[8:41] we know that for you know
[8:44] we know truly that God had
[8:47] a plan and a purpose
[8:50] that he was going to achieve
[8:53] this is not
[8:56] the story of you and I
[8:59] you know that's what we want to make it
[9:01] ah me I I'm this I
[9:04] and that doesn't work too good
[9:07] it's the Plan of Redemption
[9:10] for God to show what he done
[9:13] because that's what it is see
[9:16] it is he that has made us enough we
[9:18] ourselves remember he created us we we
[9:21] didn't create him you said we created us
[9:23] yeah he had to create Us in the wound of
[9:26] Mama I mean from Mama and from Daddy and
[9:29] allow it that'll be made that away
[9:31] brought us into being
[9:34] right but God had a plan and a purpose
[9:40] and that plan and purpose was
[9:43] to
[9:44] display himself
[9:48] through his attributes
[9:51] that he had in him before the world ever
[9:53] begun before anything ever came into
[9:56] being
[9:57] he didn't gain attributes coming down
[10:00] you know he displayed attributes coming
[10:03] down
[10:04] he already had all of those attributes
[10:06] his savior healer deliverer Etc all
[10:10] right
[10:10] but there was no way to make that
[10:13] manifest
[10:15] when he created man that could have made
[10:17] manifest him when he created angels that
[10:20] could make manifest him being God the
[10:22] word god which means the Angels could
[10:25] worship Him
[10:26] all right and then his I was trying to
[10:28] bring out the other day on the body and
[10:31] I want to get a little more into that
[10:32] tonight too that
[10:34] you know
[10:35] he could have
[10:38] brought all of us into being
[10:41] and given us eternal life
[10:46] and it would have been a beautiful
[10:47] picture
[10:49] but that wouldn't have displayed any of
[10:51] his attributes
[10:52] that would have made him a father
[10:57] just as the Angels worship Him made him
[10:59] God huh see then he would come out to be
[11:01] father because that would mean he would
[11:03] have offspring
[11:06] and that would have been beautiful
[11:07] but that would not have displayed his
[11:10] attributes as Savior healer Etc all
[11:13] right
[11:15] so now God couldn't devise a plan now
[11:19] I'll get to that in a minute because I
[11:21] got my notes
[11:23] he couldn't make a plan
[11:26] as we think about it well he just he
[11:29] just done it this way
[11:30] no he had to do it
[11:33] whatever God would do he had to do it
[11:36] where he could never be brought into
[11:38] question
[11:40] right
[11:42] because if he could be brought into
[11:43] question about it then he would be just
[11:46] like you and I
[11:48] so we go to Christ the mystery of God
[11:50] reveal he had a plan and a purpose
[11:53] and it was a great mystery
[11:56] right
[11:58] in that plan and purpose
[12:00] and that it would be that he would
[12:04] create us
[12:07] perfect
[12:08] because he cannot create anything any
[12:11] other way
[12:13] you say well look at me he made me this
[12:14] way he didn't make you an eye center
[12:18] a little baby laying in a and there you
[12:21] know just from the Mama's wound it's
[12:22] it's it's perfect because you could ever
[12:25] see anything to be
[12:27] because of the way it is
[12:29] all right God cannot bring forth you say
[12:32] well a baby's born with a disease that's
[12:34] because of the domain we're in the
[12:36] genetics Etc
[12:39] it's not what God made
[12:42] he couldn't make us a sinner as I keep
[12:44] saying
[12:45] and then save us
[12:48] that would be defeating his purpose what
[12:50] anybody that's perfect to start with
[12:54] like come on think about it
[12:58] why didn't he just make us perfect to
[13:00] start with
[13:01] because that would have not made his
[13:03] attributes
[13:05] come into being
[13:06] right and we wouldn't love him you say
[13:09] oh yes we would love him
[13:12] may I remind you
[13:15] and I know I don't like to be this way
[13:17] but this is just my way I guess
[13:22] you say he just made us we'd have been
[13:25] perfect
[13:32] I remember
[13:35] the fact in the word that it teaches it
[13:38] he made Adam and Eve perfect
[13:42] not Eternal you know in bodies
[13:46] but even to have eternal life in their
[13:48] soul
[13:52] see we think old if God was just to make
[13:54] me perfect I would never do nothing
[13:56] wrong
[13:59] why do we do wrong even after having
[14:04] eternal life
[14:05] in our soul and as much as God has done
[14:08] for us
[14:10] come on
[14:11] well brother Dale I don't do wrong well
[14:13] pray for me all right
[14:17] I'm a sinner saved by grace
[14:20] all right
[14:22] and I got to keep confessing that
[14:25] all right
[14:26] now we don't go out and
[14:28] you know Corrals and drinking and
[14:31] gambling no no no no no no
[14:34] that's supposed to went away with a new
[14:36] birth if it if we do that we're lost
[14:39] that's right that's no problem
[14:42] but yet why didn't he just make us
[14:45] perfect
[14:50] he made Adam and Eve perfect
[14:54] amen
[14:55] but they fail
[14:58] oh if he just made me first
[15:02] oh yeah
[15:05] yeah Gloria Hallelujah
[15:08] if it had just obeyed you first it
[15:10] wouldn't have been no fall
[15:12] baloney
[15:16] remember
[15:18] he made Adam and Eve as perfect as
[15:21] perfect could be
[15:25] and they fail yep because the only thing
[15:28] he done was give him a choice
[15:33] we want to blame this we want to blame
[15:35] that
[15:35] I got in my notes Here on just a thought
[15:39] I wrote like this
[15:42] instead of us trying to believe
[15:46] what has been done
[15:49] said taught Etc
[15:51] and accepting that
[15:56] we've got to try to figure it out
[16:01] we got to figure out how it works
[16:05] you know
[16:07] yeah
[16:09] if we can figure out how it works it's
[16:11] not by faith
[16:15] right amen you know what I'm talking
[16:17] about
[16:18] we're not satisfied with your saying I
[16:21] believe it
[16:24] thank you Lord
[16:26] I believe it
[16:28] we want to figure out how that the cow
[16:30] eats a green grass
[16:33] it goes into the bellies it goes to the
[16:35] walls it turns from one color to the
[16:38] other it goes through water's added we
[16:40] want to figure it all out
[16:44] I'd rather just drink them yeah forget
[16:46] it
[16:50] because y'all wouldn't raise like we was
[16:52] we had to drink milk that had wild
[16:54] onions in it
[16:56] or we didn't drink any milk
[16:59] but I never tried to figure it out I
[17:01] just got me a big old onion and ate the
[17:03] sucker while I was drinking the milk
[17:05] because that's the only way you could do
[17:07] it
[17:08] yes old country folks didn't have enough
[17:10] sense to figure out how to get that
[17:13] defect out of it we just had to use it
[17:17] all right
[17:18] but now listen
[17:21] the only thing that we found
[17:26] now I've been hard on this I know
[17:29] the only thing that we found wrong or
[17:31] not wrong excuse me
[17:34] the only thing that we found that
[17:36] uh came into being
[17:41] was free more agency
[17:46] and I've talked to you I don't believe
[17:47] Eve was so
[17:49] um
[17:50] you know
[17:52] no
[17:54] I don't believe that
[17:56] I've taught you what I believe
[17:59] that that Beast talked to her and begin
[18:02] to reason with her about motherhood
[18:04] and how that was what she was made for
[18:07] until that brought up into her the
[18:10] desire
[18:13] to bring forth children
[18:16] but you know that was on the free moral
[18:18] agency point
[18:20] that is the point of free more lady
[18:22] that's not creating somebody wrong
[18:26] we want to blame everything on Eve when
[18:28] the Bible says in Adam all die but the
[18:30] same thing about an eve I'll die
[18:35] is he had a choice
[18:37] he had a free Mortal agency choice
[18:40] right
[18:42] he could have said I ain't gonna take
[18:43] her
[18:46] no
[18:47] but see God foreknew
[18:51] all of these things and we've been
[18:53] through that the brother said God knew
[18:55] if he created us
[18:58] even perfect
[19:01] you know
[19:03] we'd still fall
[19:06] he knew that
[19:08] but in YouTube by doing that that away
[19:15] that he would be able to display his
[19:16] attributes
[19:18] and that he wasn't as I tried to preach
[19:20] to you he wouldn't stay in the garden
[19:23] and leave man and run him out he came
[19:26] out of the garden
[19:28] when I was trying to get across Sunday
[19:29] there he came out of the garden
[19:33] to
[19:34] associate himself with mankind
[19:38] the very people that had turned him down
[19:42] he done everything he could do
[19:45] to try to get him to straighten up and
[19:47] do right
[19:48] right
[19:51] but the problem was
[19:56] that we as Mankind in by the Fall
[20:01] was brought into Satan's domain or
[20:04] Kingdom
[20:06] then would be born in sin see if it in
[20:08] iniquity spoused from her mother's wound
[20:10] the psalmist David says and go forth a
[20:13] liar
[20:15] so anything that came after the Fallen
[20:18] condition
[20:19] would come that way
[20:25] you see
[20:28] God then
[20:29] immediately
[20:32] I've got a note in here a minute but I
[20:35] want to read something right around and
[20:37] say yes and I was reading and I thought
[20:39] oh Lord
[20:42] he said well how come you've been over
[20:44] this and over this and over this so much
[20:48] because somebody's not getting it I'll
[20:50] read that quote in a minute
[20:52] all right
[20:56] that's it that's maybe me
[20:58] bear with me till I get it all right
[21:04] but see when he gave man a free moral
[21:06] agency a choice
[21:10] he knew that we would fall
[21:13] by his foreknowledge
[21:15] but he also knew
[21:18] he would set out immediately
[21:22] to redeem the Fallen mankind
[21:26] they're in the garden I told you
[21:29] he put the skins on Adam and Eve made an
[21:33] atonement
[21:34] bloody skins
[21:40] I put enmity between thy seed
[21:42] and the seed of the woman
[21:44] how much of the coming Messiah
[21:47] right
[21:49] that would come to save you and I am and
[21:52] that coming Messiah would be the way to
[21:55] display
[21:57] the attributes of healer savior Redeemer
[22:03] right amen
[22:06] amen
[22:09] then he would
[22:10] ordain away
[22:15] you mind that word
[22:18] prepare
[22:19] ordained
[22:21] a way to save man
[22:26] a way that man would be lost
[22:31] by allowing us to come with a choice
[22:34] ordain in it see
[22:38] then making it work
[22:40] Ed that he could come and fulfill his
[22:42] plan
[22:44] all right
[22:46] as I said I think instead of us
[22:49] believing what has been done
[22:53] and accepting it
[22:55] we try to figure out
[22:58] how it happened
[23:01] you know all right instead of believing
[23:03] it
[23:04] why not just believe what God says amen
[23:09] amen be a whole lot easier right
[23:12] you know
[23:15] not let's think about this
[23:19] plan and purpose of God
[23:24] you know that God wanted to
[23:28] display his attributes we've been
[23:30] through that a lot
[23:33] but he wanted to share his own life
[23:36] amen
[23:40] right
[23:43] he wanted to share his own life
[23:46] with mankind
[23:49] what a beautiful picture
[23:52] I had this quote
[23:53] and I want to read and it's quite a
[23:55] lengthy one
[23:56] I've had it laying on my desk for about
[23:58] three months I guess
[24:02] and I thought Lord I need to just read
[24:04] that whole thing
[24:07] to worry that we could see
[24:13] really the truth
[24:17] of what God's plan and purpose was
[24:21] he said when he wanted to be a savior
[24:24] he wanted to be a Healer
[24:28] that's wonderful and I believe that and
[24:30] that's part of the plan
[24:32] but what about him wanting to share his
[24:34] own life
[24:37] amen
[24:38] with his
[24:41] people that he created
[24:45] and by sharing his own life would
[24:47] actually make us
[24:50] his offspring
[24:55] there's more to it than just say a
[24:57] savior
[24:59] now come on
[25:01] the foolish virgins get saved one day
[25:03] right
[25:04] Jews get saved one day
[25:07] a cup of water in my name could bring
[25:09] you salvation one day
[25:17] Mr healer
[25:21] right
[25:23] because you know what Divine Healing is
[25:25] an example of
[25:28] a glorified body
[25:31] right
[25:33] healing is an example
[25:35] of the fact that one day we will be
[25:38] eternally healed
[25:41] Joyce more than just think of a plan and
[25:44] a purpose or to be a savior to be a
[25:47] Healer
[25:51] could happen and not have a thing in the
[25:52] world
[25:58] to do I hope you're listening
[26:00] I'm trying to be just dead serious as I
[26:02] can because I know the hour that we're
[26:05] living
[26:06] we're very close
[26:08] what that means I don't care 20 years
[26:10] what I care
[26:11] be an old man but I'll wobble up here
[26:13] and still preach
[26:16] as long as I got a brain left
[26:18] you just pray for the brain
[26:20] don't worry about the body it's got to
[26:22] be getting older
[26:24] pray for the brain to stay
[26:27] all right
[26:28] and then even pray that God can use a
[26:30] thing if it wears out
[26:34] but listen
[26:38] do you follow me
[26:41] we're looking at things and trying to
[26:44] instead of taking the statement and
[26:47] analyze it don't try to figure it out
[26:49] analyze what it's saying there's a lot
[26:51] of difference in analyzing or looking at
[26:53] something you know and and studying it
[26:56] through the word than it is to try to
[26:57] figure it out
[26:59] right yep
[27:02] but he could be a savior
[27:09] and save the foolish virgins
[27:12] he could be a Healer
[27:15] and heal anybody today
[27:20] see I'm wanting the ultimate end of
[27:23] healing
[27:24] amen which is this body made eternal
[27:29] not to get a new one this one made new
[27:33] redeem it
[27:34] all right
[27:37] now I'm wanting the ultimate of
[27:39] salvation
[27:43] that the eternal life that I have in my
[27:45] soul
[27:48] and come out into my body and my being
[27:52] and it can be a future home
[27:55] and even the world's got to follow us
[27:58] right
[28:01] you see what I'm getting at
[28:03] we just say oh he's a Healer he want to
[28:05] be this no
[28:09] as I was saying there that the other day
[28:10] about it I know that was kind of a
[28:13] an odd way of me putting it but think
[28:15] about it
[28:17] Jesus Christ was almighty God right
[28:21] do you believe whatever he said would
[28:23] have had to happen
[28:25] and we know he couldn't say it under the
[28:27] father showed him so don't worry about
[28:28] it
[28:30] and he didn't do it
[28:32] but you realize if he could
[28:35] raise the Dead
[28:37] which he did
[28:39] the Lazarus right
[28:44] why couldn't he buy his word just stop
[28:46] us from dying
[28:50] right that's right
[28:53] come on don't you believe he's God
[28:56] oh no brother Dave we couldn't no he he
[28:58] didn't do that
[29:00] right come on what did he say about even
[29:02] you and I
[29:04] he said what we got in US
[29:06] if it was not controlled by a law of God
[29:10] we would create a world and go live on
[29:13] it that's right
[29:15] amen
[29:17] right
[29:21] but you see he could have done all of
[29:22] that without having to die right
[29:26] but that would have not released the
[29:28] life
[29:30] that was in him
[29:32] to where it could come back on you and I
[29:38] you would have just had people living
[29:39] forever
[29:43] that'd be a beautiful thing but
[29:47] that's not the ultimate end
[29:49] God's ultimate in is to share I want to
[29:52] read it in a minute here he wants to
[29:54] share his eternal life with you and I
[29:59] them in
[30:01] now according to my Bible
[30:04] I guess yours still reads out
[30:06] Jesus is supposed to be almighty God
[30:12] and I thought we was to be uh equal
[30:17] is that what scripture said
[30:19] and says co-equal
[30:25] right I thought that's what the Bible
[30:27] said
[30:29] well
[30:31] see it's a little more than just
[30:33] well they just displaying an attribute
[30:38] blood
[30:39] but now's the time to
[30:42] look at it and really see what's taking
[30:44] place
[30:49] to share
[30:51] his own life
[30:55] now now listen to my point without
[30:57] getting it all that's what I said you
[30:59] try to figure it out so listen this is
[31:00] the point of what I'm saying what about
[31:02] his ability what if he could just made
[31:04] us flesh and just stopped death in this
[31:07] you know everything
[31:08] what if he then could just give
[31:10] everybody in the world eternal life just
[31:14] he will one day give a lot of people
[31:17] eternal life right
[31:23] at the white Throne he'll give a lot of
[31:25] people eternal life
[31:26] why couldn't he just speak that while he
[31:28] was here
[31:31] and bypass the death and the things
[31:35] and it would have been easy for him to
[31:36] do his
[31:38] Satan was trying to tempt him
[31:42] do this do that do this do that
[31:44] he could have just said put that's it
[31:47] but you see
[31:49] that would have not been
[31:52] his plan and purpose
[31:57] his plan and purpose was to share his
[32:01] own life
[32:04] with you and I
[32:07] not just by listen not just by
[32:10] impartation
[32:14] was imparted eternal life right amen
[32:18] come on Blasphemous name read the book
[32:20] you're on tape listening or something
[32:24] he said especially into Adam
[32:27] and he became an eternal person with God
[32:30] Amen it says
[32:35] but you know that still wasn't God's
[32:37] plan
[32:42] yeah see you're trying to figure it out
[32:47] what about the the ability to do all of
[32:50] that but yet he wouldn't do it that away
[32:54] he would do it to her that you and I
[32:58] would have a desire in our heart
[33:02] and he would work according to that
[33:04] desire and he would give us while we are
[33:07] here on this Earth
[33:09] eternal life in our soul right
[33:12] by the new birth
[33:17] you don't have to go somewhere and get
[33:18] eternal life in your soul if you're born
[33:20] again you have it
[33:25] that's just that part of where we're
[33:27] reading in Romans about see
[33:31] predestinate
[33:33] you realize your whole life is
[33:35] predestinated
[33:37] amen well then I can't change it see
[33:40] that's where you're thinking right
[33:42] our whole life is predestinated because
[33:45] God knew what we do
[33:49] not by what we do
[33:52] is what he knew we'd do and we're going
[33:54] to do it because he knew we would that's
[33:56] sensible
[33:58] right
[34:00] I didn't lost my notes now
[34:03] but listen Church
[34:07] he then promised the seed of the woman
[34:10] to come
[34:14] right and through that seat of the woman
[34:16] which is Jesus
[34:22] Christ he then didn't stay in the garden
[34:25] he came out
[34:31] and one day he displayed
[34:34] on Earth
[34:37] what he really wanted
[34:46] he displayed eternal life
[34:51] in flesh
[34:53] what he really wanted it to be
[34:59] listen
[35:00] our will and our desire and talks had a
[35:03] lot to do with our predestination I'll
[35:04] get back onto those things
[35:06] but I want to just read something to you
[35:10] I said it's quite a lengthy reading but
[35:12] it'll show us I believe what I've just
[35:14] said go ahead and pull up number one
[35:16] we'll start reading
[35:19] this is taken from the Ephesian Church
[35:21] age the church age book
[35:23] chapter three
[35:27] paragraph or page 102 it'll go through
[35:29] quite a bit of reading
[35:32] now that we have come this far let me
[35:34] try to crystallize your thinking on this
[35:35] subject so you can see the necessity of
[35:38] our going into the serpent Seed doctrine
[35:40] as I have we start with the fact that
[35:43] there were two trees in the midst of the
[35:45] garden
[35:45] the tree of life was Jesus
[35:48] the other tree is definitely Satan
[35:49] because of what came forth of the fruit
[35:53] of that tree
[35:55] now then we know that both of those
[35:58] trees had a relationship to man or they
[36:01] would never have been placed there
[36:04] all right now
[36:07] they must have had a part in the
[36:10] sovereign
[36:11] plan and purpose of God
[36:16] in their relationship to mankind
[36:19] and to himself
[36:21] or we could never impute omniscience
[36:23] unto God okay
[36:26] this is all true so far is it not
[36:29] the word must definitely set forth that
[36:33] from before the foundation of the Earth
[36:35] the purpose of God was was what to share
[36:40] his eternal life
[36:43] with man
[36:47] now get the thought of what I was trying
[36:50] to bring him on ago
[36:52] get it to the point of thinking
[36:55] somebody else could make these things be
[36:58] displayed
[37:01] you know
[37:03] foolish virgin getting eternal life
[37:06] world the people out there being healed
[37:08] today right
[37:13] but you see I'm wanting to get into a
[37:15] little closer I want to be in on the
[37:17] plan and purpose
[37:20] and by doing that it's going to cost me
[37:23] right
[37:25] you know what it cost Jesus
[37:29] a life of horrible rejection of mankind
[37:34] in a day that he was beaten until he
[37:36] looked like a piece of hamburger meat
[37:39] that's just quoting brother random
[37:42] and then actually to die
[37:48] are you and I willing to die for this
[37:50] plan and purpose that we're talking
[37:51] about
[37:53] God didn't want us to die he wants us to
[37:55] live
[37:57] come on
[37:59] the purpose of God was to share his
[38:01] eternal life with man now he gives you
[38:03] the scripture
[38:05] Ephesians 1 4-11 according as he has
[38:08] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[38:10] of the world that we should be holding
[38:12] Without Blame before him in love
[38:14] this is a special group of people right
[38:18] not just
[38:19] somebody getting eternal life
[38:22] not just somebody being healed I
[38:24] preached that
[38:26] this is to bring out the ultimate end of
[38:28] a change of a body
[38:30] the ultimate end of redemption and
[38:33] coming through the stature of a perfect
[38:34] man and coming all up into the adoption
[38:39] you know in the manifestation of God
[38:42] until we're that God is going to put
[38:46] into somebody's hand
[38:48] the right to speak
[38:50] right
[38:53] a lot to be done right according as he
[38:55] has chosen Us in him before the
[38:56] foundation were that we should be
[38:58] holding Without Blame before him in love
[39:00] what having predestinated us unto the
[39:03] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[39:06] himself according to the good pleasure
[39:08] of his will
[39:10] now how does he predestinate we've been
[39:12] over 40 something sermons how does God
[39:14] predestinate by his foreknowledge
[39:16] Now by his desires by his foreknowledge
[39:20] to the praise or the glory of his grace
[39:22] wherein he hath made us accepted into
[39:24] beloved
[39:25] in whom we have Redemption through his
[39:27] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[39:30] to the riches of his grace
[39:32] wherein Heath abounded toward us in all
[39:35] wisdom and prudence
[39:37] having made
[39:38] miss us the mystery of his will
[39:43] now I know I'm not going to get that far
[39:46] but I want to stop and just say
[39:48] something
[39:50] I know what that word means of what he's
[39:54] using it there
[39:57] you know his will
[40:00] his will is his desire his plan his
[40:03] purpose Etc
[40:06] but
[40:08] you know you spell another word exactly
[40:10] the same way
[40:17] you go down and you make out a will
[40:22] and you put in that wheel
[40:26] what you want done with what you have
[40:30] ain't gonna get there tonight but
[40:34] I want you to think about it
[40:39] where it is made us abounded toward us
[40:40] in all wisdom having made known unto us
[40:43] the mystery of his will
[40:45] according to his good pleasure we're in
[40:47] Heath purpose in himself
[40:49] that is the dispensation
[40:52] now if the will of God is his word
[40:57] that in the
[40:59] Indonesian of the fullness of times
[41:02] which is down here where we're at
[41:04] he might gather together in one of all
[41:08] things in Christ
[41:09] both which are in heaven and which are
[41:11] on earth even in him
[41:14] in whom also we have obtained an
[41:17] inheritance
[41:20] being predestinated according to the
[41:22] purpose of him
[41:24] who work with all things after the
[41:26] Council of his own will
[41:33] now remember when I get back to it is a
[41:35] little bit more than what I'm saying but
[41:37] remember his will is his word
[41:41] so he said it he's going to bring it to
[41:43] pies
[41:45] he can't take it back right I'm glad of
[41:48] that I might not have a thing in the
[41:50] world to ever do with salvation or God
[41:51] or anything but I know one thing for
[41:53] sure he ain't gonna lie
[41:56] somebody
[41:57] can take it and believe it
[42:00] then I turned back around say Lord let
[42:02] help me help my unbelief then he goes to
[42:05] Revelations 13 8.
[42:07] now remember he's talking about how to
[42:10] share his own eternal life
[42:12] you remember
[42:14] his purpose was to what share his
[42:17] eternal life with man
[42:18] now he goes to Revelation 13 8 and all
[42:21] that dwell upon the Earth shall worship
[42:23] him Satan whose names are not written in
[42:26] the Book of Life of the lamb slain from
[42:29] the foundation of the world
[42:30] dropped all the way back don't it listen
[42:34] but that life could not and would not be
[42:37] shared in any other way than through the
[42:41] way of God manifest In the Flesh
[42:44] now the only way he can give anybody
[42:47] life
[42:49] other than a creational whatever you
[42:51] would want to call it would he do it and
[42:53] he didn't do it but
[42:55] it's going to take
[42:58] God to come
[43:02] into the world
[43:05] God not a second person
[43:10] not a third person not even the first
[43:12] person because if you say the first
[43:14] person that convenience two or three
[43:15] more the prophet said he's not even the
[43:17] first word he said he is the person
[43:19] right all right
[43:22] God manifest in the flesh is the only
[43:24] way you can do it this was part of the
[43:26] Eternal and predestinated purpose
[43:31] there's you planning your purpose what
[43:34] was his
[43:36] plan and purpose
[43:38] to come into flesh
[43:42] then
[43:45] to redeem you and I
[43:47] okay
[43:48] this plan was to be
[43:50] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[43:53] it was the Plan of Redemption
[43:56] it was the Plan of Salvation now listen
[43:59] closely God being a savior was necessary
[44:02] that he predestinated man
[44:05] who would require salvation in order to
[44:08] give himself reason and purpose of being
[44:13] right okay
[44:14] anybody got any problems with it
[44:16] well now
[44:20] what I'm going to say it
[44:23] instead of taking what the truth of it
[44:25] is god brother random I'll give it to
[44:28] you over and over and over and over
[44:29] right the only way God predestinations
[44:32] by his foreknowledge
[44:34] right
[44:36] he doesn't predestinate my desires
[44:39] prison destination by his foreknowledge
[44:42] all right
[44:43] well yep brother Dale that's just not
[44:45] that great mystery that we we think is a
[44:47] great mystery in the entire my great
[44:48] Mysteries I miss you I missed
[44:53] I thought that's what the devil said I
[44:56] will ascend
[44:58] to the most high
[45:02] if there's anything in you and I worth
[45:04] anything it has been given unto us by
[45:08] God himself that had to die to release
[45:10] it but brother Dale my God can't die
[45:15] well I suggest you get rid of him and
[45:17] take the one the word speaks of
[45:20] that's my suggestion
[45:28] but listen
[45:30] it was necessary that he predestined
[45:32] made a man who would require salvation
[45:35] in order to give himself reason and
[45:37] purpose of being
[45:39] is that sensible enough
[45:41] that is 100 correct and multitudes of
[45:45] scripture burned out as does the very
[45:47] pointed verse of Romans 11 36 for him
[45:51] and through him and to him are all
[45:54] things to whom be glory forever amen
[45:59] there's anything all through him look
[46:02] man could not directly come and partake
[46:05] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[46:08] garden
[46:11] that eternal life of the tree had to
[46:13] become flesh first
[46:18] but before God could raise and save a
[46:21] sinner
[46:22] you had to have a sinner to raise and
[46:24] Save
[46:25] man had to fall
[46:28] listen
[46:30] the fall which would be caused by Satan
[46:35] had to have flesh
[46:37] to make fall
[46:39] Now read real careful and think real
[46:42] deep
[46:44] Satan had to come through the flesh also
[46:47] but I got this figured out Satan he must
[46:49] have he he
[46:52] Satan
[46:54] is an angel
[46:56] he is not a human being
[47:00] he's an angel
[47:03] he doesn't have any flesh
[47:07] he could not come into the flesh
[47:10] let's read a little more
[47:13] before God could raise and Save The
[47:16] Sinner he had to have one the fall which
[47:17] would be caused by Satan
[47:19] had to have flesh
[47:21] to make fall now okay analyzed little at
[47:25] the time
[47:28] come on the fall which would be caused
[47:30] by Satan
[47:31] had to have flesh to make fall
[47:33] so if it's God's plan and purpose the
[47:36] flesh was planning to come
[47:39] they went out to be flesh
[47:42] right now come on
[47:47] Satan had to come through the flesh also
[47:50] now how did Satan come through the flesh
[47:54] you couldn't create
[47:55] you don't have no flesh you know I know
[47:57] seed he couldn't plant it then Eve right
[48:00] see Satan had to come through flesh also
[48:03] how did Satan come through flesh
[48:08] but Satan could not come through human
[48:10] flesh
[48:16] to make the fall
[48:19] as
[48:21] would Christ come in human flesh
[48:23] to restore the Fallen
[48:25] Satan can't do that
[48:27] okay
[48:29] but that was an animal the serpent
[48:33] so close to man that Satan could get to
[48:35] the beat to that beast and through that
[48:38] Beast he could get to human flesh
[48:41] and calls to fall
[48:46] no problem right
[48:49] you're going to use the Beast right
[48:51] because he can't do it himself
[48:52] watch
[48:55] and inject himself
[48:57] thereby into the human race
[49:03] now what did he inject
[49:06] into the human race
[49:12] the Beast with Eve
[49:14] brought Cain
[49:18] what's he talking about
[49:23] but there was an animal a serpent so
[49:25] close into man that Satan could get to
[49:28] that beast and through that Beast
[49:31] he could get to human flesh and cause to
[49:34] fall and inject himself thereby into the
[49:37] human race
[49:38] watch
[49:40] even as Jesus would one day come and
[49:44] inject himself into the human race
[49:48] into human bodies
[49:55] now
[49:56] so the only thing Satan could do was use
[49:59] the Beast to pervert right
[50:01] come on we've been through all of it I
[50:03] tried to explain this a few weeks ago
[50:09] how is it then
[50:12] that Jesus would come one day and inject
[50:15] himself into the human race
[50:22] how did Jesus inject himself into the
[50:25] human race
[50:28] you want to say it I was reading that I
[50:30] thought I better go through this
[50:32] because the prophet said I don't thank
[50:34] the people are getting it
[50:38] Jesus inject himself into the human race
[50:42] it was not listen
[50:45] him as a baby being born
[50:52] that didn't inject him into the human
[50:54] race
[50:55] I brought a body
[50:59] come on
[51:02] how did Jesus Christ inject himself into
[51:04] the human race
[51:05] on the death Pentecost when that Holy
[51:08] Ghost fell
[51:09] he injected himself into the human race
[51:15] that's exactly what Satan done
[51:20] Satan injected himself into the human
[51:23] race as that devil of unbelief that you
[51:27] and I were born kin folks too while your
[51:30] Prophet said we're born between Satan
[51:32] and Eve
[51:34] and we're all a hybrid
[51:38] are you listening
[51:42] Satan injected himself into the human
[51:45] race
[51:46] not a seed he could plant
[51:50] he couldn't create
[51:53] he injected his unbelief
[52:01] injected that unbelief into that soul of
[52:04] each one of us
[52:07] that's why I told you God never put us
[52:09] in no pawn shop I'd like to hear that
[52:11] preach we say we're in a pawn shop we're
[52:12] going to be redeemed how'd you get the
[52:14] pawn shop God didn't put you in the pawn
[52:16] shop
[52:21] come on he can't put you in a pawn shop
[52:22] and redeem you out of it
[52:25] we put ourselves in the pawn shop right
[52:28] when we reach the age of accountability
[52:30] we accepted Satan's lives and put
[52:34] ourselves into the human
[52:37] garbage can
[52:41] put ourselves in the pawn shop
[52:46] you see
[52:47] come not very sensible when you think
[52:49] about it
[52:50] instead of trying to figure it out
[52:55] are you going to deny what he said
[52:58] he said the same way that Jesus injected
[53:00] himself into the human race was the same
[53:02] way that Satan injected himself in
[53:11] that means an entrance
[53:13] into
[53:15] our soul
[53:18] Satan when we were born he enters into
[53:23] now listen a baby when it's first born
[53:26] until it reaches the age of
[53:28] accountability
[53:32] that Soul has got to be created perfect
[53:35] not Eternal I didn't say that
[53:38] I said perfect
[53:41] God create I don't care if it's Mom and
[53:43] Daddy it's both perverted
[53:47] start to say that word I can't say
[53:53] okay what it is
[53:57] God gives life to the baby
[54:00] no matter how bad mama is how bad daddy
[54:03] is the baby
[54:06] is created perfect
[54:10] the soul of the baby the spirit of the
[54:13] baby even the bodies you know yourself
[54:15] come on we're in the human race
[54:18] you take a calf it's got to get to its
[54:21] Mama within a certain amount of hours to
[54:24] get that colostrum and about to
[54:25] pronounce that word
[54:27] because if it don't get that within a
[54:29] certain amount of hours you can do
[54:31] anything you want to for it it's going
[54:33] to die within about 14 to 21 days
[54:38] but if it can get that colostrum into
[54:40] that well it's got like four stomachs
[54:43] but only one of them starts working
[54:48] usually what I'm talking about
[54:49] used to I know it's got into where we're
[54:51] just so perverted but used to a baby was
[54:53] almost immune to diseases for the first
[54:55] six months you didn't have to worry
[54:56] about it but now you got to worry about
[54:58] it when it's first born
[54:59] why because of the degrading of the
[55:01] human race
[55:07] let me see that little baby when it
[55:08] comes into the world you look down it
[55:10] and you see it it's got a it's a body
[55:12] it's a spirit and it's a soul
[55:16] and that Spirit can't be perverted
[55:18] because it don't know how to be
[55:19] perverted it starts hearing a perversion
[55:21] when it looks up in the I mean it don't
[55:22] look up but it's laying there in the
[55:24] hospital room and they're cussing and
[55:25] snorting and Raising Cane it starts
[55:28] hearing all of that in the hospital room
[55:31] starts on this route to being perverted
[55:34] that's how Satan is injecting himself
[55:36] into the human race
[55:40] he can't create
[55:42] but he can pervert
[55:45] right now listen
[55:48] look what he says
[55:50] even as Jesus one day would come and
[55:52] inject himself into the human race by
[55:54] the new birth
[55:56] into human bodies
[55:57] put it in here
[56:00] not eternal life in these bodies but
[56:02] it's going to come to that listen
[56:06] a bit of a resurrection
[56:08] wherein we would have bodies lock into
[56:10] his glorified one goes all the way over
[56:12] to that right
[56:14] thus God work
[56:16] s it's that's what God worked out in the
[56:18] garden
[56:19] was his predestinated plan
[56:24] and when Satan had brought about that
[56:27] which was necessary to the purpose of
[56:29] God
[56:31] then man could not get to the Tree of
[56:33] Life In The Garden rarely not it wasn't
[56:36] time
[56:37] but an animal animal had calls to fall
[56:41] and did not
[56:43] that animal life be shed
[56:46] was taken in his blood shed and then
[56:49] give God had communion with man again
[56:53] even though the blood of bulls and goats
[56:56] then there was to come a day
[56:58] when God would appear
[57:02] what in flesh
[57:05] that's Jesus Christ right
[57:07] come on
[57:09] and by means of his humiliation
[57:12] he would restore Fallen man
[57:14] and making a particular of that eternal
[57:17] life
[57:18] once you see this you can understand the
[57:20] serpent seed and know that it was no I
[57:23] believe eight no it was
[57:25] degrading of humanity by intermingling
[57:29] the seed
[57:32] if I was you I'd go home if you wanted
[57:34] I'll be glad to give you this all you
[57:37] got to do to 102 Church age book and
[57:39] read it
[57:40] just keep reading it
[57:43] all that I preached for months is right
[57:46] there in that one reading
[57:49] for us to understand
[57:52] to come to a place
[57:54] to understand the Plan of Redemption
[58:00] it would be his predestinated plan
[58:03] now how does he predestinate
[58:06] by his foreknowledge
[58:10] somebody's foreknowledge in you
[58:12] if he put us in the garden perfect
[58:16] that we would fall
[58:20] right he knew we'd do that
[58:23] yes but if I had just have been back
[58:24] there I wouldn't have done it
[58:28] I remember a man talking to God one day
[58:33] and he looked back at him through Jesus
[58:35] Christ and he said
[58:38] you garnish the tombs
[58:42] you say if I'd have been back there I
[58:44] wouldn't have done that
[58:45] he said but you garnish the tombs
[58:49] is anything wrong
[58:51] keeping the tongues clean
[58:57] so evidently there must have been a
[58:59] thought involved right
[59:04] what was he saying to him he said if
[59:05] you'd been back there you'd have done
[59:06] the same thing that they done
[59:09] because you're now garnishing the tombs
[59:12] you're thinking they were okay
[59:16] um
[59:17] but listen
[59:22] God knowing
[59:25] the beginning
[59:28] the ending
[59:30] by his foreknowledge
[59:34] he could write all those names we were
[59:36] talking about Sunday
[59:39] it was a book of names
[59:42] you can write those names in the Lamb's
[59:44] Book of Life
[59:48] because he knows
[59:50] he could write in The Book of Life names
[59:52] and put them in take them out do
[59:54] whatever intersection call The Book of
[59:57] Life
[59:58] because he knows so Jacob have I loved
[1:00:01] and he saw how I hated
[1:00:06] because he knew what Jacob would do he
[1:00:08] knew what he saw would do
[1:00:09] but if we were back there we'd take up
[1:00:11] for Esau
[1:00:15] oh don't be so super religious right
[1:00:19] be sensible
[1:00:23] did anybody know Judas and who he was
[1:00:27] no everybody voting the man of the year
[1:00:29] you know that right
[1:00:32] he must have been pretty well thought of
[1:00:34] because everybody voted him treasure
[1:00:39] if you ever have any trouble it's always
[1:00:41] money
[1:00:42] no you know
[1:00:46] but think about it
[1:00:49] but God would work it out
[1:00:53] for his own Glory
[1:00:59] he is playing in his purpose
[1:01:02] to share his eternal life
[1:01:08] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[1:01:10] God doesn't predestinate by his desires
[1:01:12] he's not willing to do any should perish
[1:01:15] I'm reading from the super sign 1963
[1:01:17] 1129 which is number two you can go
[1:01:20] ahead and put it up
[1:01:22] God doesn't predestinate by the desires
[1:01:24] how many times we read that he's not
[1:01:26] willing that any should perish
[1:01:28] we buy his foreknowledge he knew he
[1:01:30] would accept it and he would not
[1:01:31] therefore he can foretell the end from
[1:01:33] the beginning and therefore he knew that
[1:01:35] we would live in this day he knew that
[1:01:39] this would be our day he had plans for
[1:01:43] this day
[1:01:45] he had plans for every day
[1:01:49] and never had one of his plans ever
[1:01:51] failed
[1:01:53] he's always on time
[1:01:55] he's got plans for this day
[1:01:58] he's had plans for every age right
[1:02:03] by his foreknowledge he knew exactly
[1:02:04] what Martin Luther would do
[1:02:08] but you know what they had to come a
[1:02:10] date at Martin Luther
[1:02:11] and to make a choice
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] they finally come and told him one day
[1:02:19] and Luther don't you know the whole
[1:02:21] world's against you and he said I want
[1:02:23] you to let them know that I'm against
[1:02:25] the whole world something to that degree
[1:02:29] he's seen a revelation
[1:02:36] brother was telling Wade the other day
[1:02:38] he said
[1:02:39] I believe the key to the entire thing is
[1:02:41] for us to realize Who We Are
[1:02:45] I've been trying to preach that for 40
[1:02:47] years
[1:02:49] to realize Who We Are
[1:02:52] and what we're here for
[1:02:54] brother Reynolds said she's not going to
[1:02:56] fall like the first Eve fail
[1:03:01] listen
[1:03:06] he's planning his purpose
[1:03:13] let's just read a couple of things down
[1:03:15] there
[1:03:16] and then we'll just have to quit
[1:03:18] but take it up Sunday ain't no problem
[1:03:20] look at number three on the notes
[1:03:24] page 34 there revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] Church age book
[1:03:28] chapter one
[1:03:29] would you like an Old Testament type
[1:03:32] let's go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:03:35] when the news came to Glory that the son
[1:03:37] Adam had been lost
[1:03:40] did God send an angel
[1:03:44] did he send a son
[1:03:48] did he send
[1:03:50] another one like unto us
[1:03:53] no he came himself
[1:03:57] to redeem that lost son
[1:04:01] Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan
[1:04:04] of Salvation to another
[1:04:08] come on you don't think the way I do I
[1:04:10] know I'm carnal
[1:04:13] if he didn't send a son then if he
[1:04:15] descended son he couldn't trust him
[1:04:18] brother to hell
[1:04:20] well
[1:04:23] is it right right that's right
[1:04:26] he said he couldn't trust nobody else
[1:04:28] right
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:33] so he couldn't trust a son if he'd have
[1:04:35] sent him
[1:04:45] God did not entrust his Plan of
[1:04:47] Salvation to another he trusted only
[1:04:49] himself
[1:04:52] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:04:55] and redeemed us unto himself
[1:04:57] we're saved by the blood of God the
[1:04:59] Eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in
[1:05:02] order to take away sin
[1:05:05] he became the lamb in order to shed his
[1:05:08] blood and enter into the veil within now
[1:05:11] that's taken from the church age book
[1:05:14] the revelations
[1:05:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:05:17] let's read where he's got to end the
[1:05:19] message the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:22] all right the next one
[1:05:24] almost identical but this is taken from
[1:05:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ priests
[1:05:29] in 1960 1204 the morning service which
[1:05:31] brother Lee Val took and wrote this
[1:05:34] right here and what this is look what
[1:05:36] he's saying look here in the beginning
[1:05:38] when Adam
[1:05:39] I just can't get away from that
[1:05:42] seemed like somebody's not getting it
[1:05:47] somewhere look
[1:05:49] in the beginning let me show you
[1:05:50] something again
[1:05:53] the Holy Spirit warns me to do this
[1:06:00] evidently knew somebody wasn't getting
[1:06:02] it right
[1:06:04] are we getting it
[1:06:06] could that been wise like this on me to
[1:06:09] read that quote
[1:06:14] I'm just asking you a simple question
[1:06:18] the Holy Spirit warns me to do this
[1:06:21] I'm leaving my subject for a moment
[1:06:22] because even on something else
[1:06:24] when the first news come to Glory that
[1:06:26] the sun had been lost Adam God did not
[1:06:29] send an angel
[1:06:30] did he send a son
[1:06:34] I lost Adam did God send an angel
[1:06:37] did he send the son did he send anyone
[1:06:40] else he came himself
[1:06:42] to redeem his lost son Hallelujah God
[1:06:45] didn't trust it with no one but himself
[1:06:48] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:06:51] and redeemed man
[1:06:53] himself it's
[1:06:55] we are saved the Bible said by the blood
[1:06:58] of God the moral God was the immortal
[1:07:02] God was made Mortal in order to take
[1:07:06] away sin to be the lamb himself to enter
[1:07:09] into Glory veiled and with his own blood
[1:07:11] before him Beyond the Veil
[1:07:15] now listen
[1:07:19] he couldn't trust it with somebody else
[1:07:25] he came himself but do we believe that
[1:07:29] why is everybody preaching all this
[1:07:31] about River Jordan and he wasn't God to
[1:07:33] the River Jordan and all I wanted to
[1:07:35] become God and God left him and he died
[1:07:37] a man and how can you do all of that
[1:07:41] he said well why do you bring that up so
[1:07:42] much
[1:07:43] because somebody here ain't getting it
[1:07:50] you're sympathizing with it
[1:07:56] right you want to quote from the prophet
[1:08:00] he says they sympathize with it
[1:08:02] and when you sympathize with something
[1:08:06] you're in bad shape
[1:08:10] but they're good people praise God
[1:08:13] a whole lot better people than I am
[1:08:16] but that ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:08:19] it's whether God's word is right or not
[1:08:24] um
[1:08:25] being good is good
[1:08:28] what the prophet said God came in South
[1:08:34] he said God came himself
[1:08:37] look at the next one
[1:08:43] 1960s 9 25 that day on Calvary you've
[1:08:47] read these before
[1:08:48] God had required it paragraph 56. no man
[1:08:51] was worthy no man was able no man could
[1:08:54] do it and God came himself
[1:09:00] all right and was made human and lived a
[1:09:02] human life under human desires and was
[1:09:05] crucified at Calvary and there Satan
[1:09:07] thought he wouldn't do it so he wouldn't
[1:09:09] Satan now or when Satan thought he
[1:09:11] wouldn't do it he wouldn't go through
[1:09:13] with it
[1:09:15] he went to Gethsemane and every
[1:09:16] Temptation that he may never stood he
[1:09:19] went through it just like all men but he
[1:09:21] prayed the price
[1:09:23] that blacked the Earth out like an
[1:09:26] anesthetic for an operation
[1:09:29] listen
[1:09:31] no wonder God in human flesh
[1:09:34] was dying
[1:09:38] so he's talking about nature going
[1:09:40] through a convulsion all kind of things
[1:09:41] happening
[1:09:43] no wonder
[1:09:46] why did the world go through all of the
[1:09:47] frustration the earthquakes the thing
[1:09:52] God
[1:09:56] in human flesh was dying
[1:09:59] it was the hour that the world had
[1:10:01] looked for yet many of them did not know
[1:10:03] it like it is today the many looked for
[1:10:05] these things and yet they don't
[1:10:06] recognize them they don't realize the
[1:10:09] way out they're still trying to seek
[1:10:10] pleasure in things of the world trying
[1:10:12] to find their way out
[1:10:15] listen
[1:10:18] I'll take up a point later on but
[1:10:23] let's read one more
[1:10:25] God rich in Mercy 1965.
[1:10:30] put it all the way down but get down to
[1:10:31] the bottom and let's read paragraph 105.
[1:10:35] this was to be an eternal
[1:10:37] atonement
[1:10:40] because he came in South
[1:10:43] God came himself in the storm form of
[1:10:46] sinful flesh to make a a an eternal
[1:10:50] atonement and suffered into flesh and
[1:10:52] made the atonement and returned back
[1:10:54] into form of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:57] to confirm that atonement
[1:10:59] we're no bright serpent no you know
[1:11:01] troubled waters you know what he's
[1:11:03] talking about you had to buy Serpa that
[1:11:05] was good but it wouldn't work Troubled
[1:11:07] Waters that wouldn't be no atonement
[1:11:10] it only just for the time
[1:11:12] in all pointed that perfect atonement
[1:11:15] God rich in his Mercy
[1:11:18] has done this
[1:11:20] now just for a second
[1:11:23] you have a brother David
[1:11:26] do you really believe in one God I
[1:11:28] surely do
[1:11:30] do you believe God died I believe what
[1:11:33] the prophet said about him dying amen
[1:11:37] amen but God can't die
[1:11:44] what is death
[1:11:48] take a gun blow my head off you can't
[1:11:51] kill me
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] you just put me in another dimension
[1:12:02] that's why it's so important to
[1:12:03] understand one true and living God Amen
[1:12:08] I've been through it with you and you
[1:12:09] know that what it brought around and
[1:12:11] said in and they're in here we'll read
[1:12:13] them Sunday if we have time
[1:12:15] he said in flesh he was a man
[1:12:17] says but in spirit he was God
[1:12:20] flexi was a man but said in Soul he was
[1:12:23] God that's two different quotes
[1:12:27] that's why I don't understand why people
[1:12:29] can't comprehend one God
[1:12:33] it just it's beyond but you you went
[1:12:36] into Oneness
[1:12:41] you don't worry about me going into
[1:12:43] Oneness you just be concerned where you
[1:12:45] at in trinitarianism
[1:12:48] yeah all right
[1:12:51] well what do you believe about God I'll
[1:12:53] give you exactly what I believe about it
[1:12:54] to the world and let them know what I
[1:12:56] believe about it because I've always
[1:12:57] preached it
[1:12:59] I believe in one thing Hebrews 10 5 a
[1:13:03] body was prepared and brought around and
[1:13:06] said by who he said the father all right
[1:13:09] he didn't provide a body for a son
[1:13:18] he provided a body for himself
[1:13:21] a body now
[1:13:23] has prepared me amen
[1:13:27] but created a body in the wound of
[1:13:29] the Virgin Mary you know started that
[1:13:32] creation
[1:13:33] of the beginning of the creation of God
[1:13:35] Amen
[1:13:39] another creation distinct from the
[1:13:41] natural
[1:13:45] created
[1:13:47] well egg and sperm placed it in the
[1:13:49] mirror in the very Mary's womb and she
[1:13:51] gave fourth birth to Emmanuel as we read
[1:13:55] in the scripture orbital trying to learn
[1:13:58] in
[1:14:00] Luke 2. born this day in the city of
[1:14:04] David as a savior which is Christ the
[1:14:07] lord
[1:14:08] right around them ask that Jew he said
[1:14:11] who will that he met will Emmanuel be
[1:14:15] like God in flesh he said yes
[1:14:21] see they're looking for a God in flesh
[1:14:26] as the Messiah
[1:14:29] why can't you look back and see what
[1:14:31] Jesus done
[1:14:34] when that baby was born from that wound
[1:14:36] or that mother the soul and the spirit
[1:14:39] of almighty God
[1:14:41] stepped into that body
[1:14:44] there was Emmanuel
[1:14:47] God With Us there wasn't the prophet
[1:14:49] said little Jehovah crying in the Cradle
[1:14:53] he said little Jehovah with no teeth
[1:14:56] that's what he explains it
[1:15:01] the Bible said it's Emmanuel
[1:15:04] God With Us
[1:15:10] when he went through his life and come
[1:15:12] to that place
[1:15:13] remember what I said the body was a
[1:15:16] creation
[1:15:18] it was not eternal
[1:15:20] you can't create eternal
[1:15:24] he could go through all of his life
[1:15:29] that was almighty God
[1:15:33] standing there talking to them
[1:15:37] Pharisees and things in the temple
[1:15:41] and his mother said your father and I
[1:15:44] wrote around and said after all of the
[1:15:45] years she had stood by he said one day
[1:15:48] she let down
[1:15:51] and said your father and I
[1:15:55] he said I must be about my father's
[1:15:58] business
[1:16:01] he said yeah but Jesus would pray don't
[1:16:04] you pray
[1:16:07] do you have God in you
[1:16:10] if you have God in you why do you pray
[1:16:14] come on is that the way you sealing it
[1:16:15] up it just oh no it's all about a lot
[1:16:18] about God that we don't know about
[1:16:24] but you see that little baby
[1:16:27] and we talk about at Christmas time
[1:16:31] the little baby laying in a Manger with
[1:16:33] almighty God
[1:16:36] or else the biggest deceiver in the
[1:16:38] world ever had
[1:16:41] he didn't become God on the River Jordan
[1:16:43] he was anointed for his ministry
[1:16:50] he was anointed with the fullness of the
[1:16:52] godhead bodily why because there was
[1:16:54] things about him he couldn't die for you
[1:16:56] and I when he was a baby he couldn't die
[1:16:58] when he was 14 to talking to the lawyers
[1:17:01] things wouldn't fulfill
[1:17:04] he didn't start his ministry
[1:17:07] he went back home with Mom and Daddy and
[1:17:09] stayed with them for a long time
[1:17:13] right
[1:17:17] but you see that's where I believe in
[1:17:18] one true and living God Amen
[1:17:22] amen but brother Dale that's just
[1:17:24] Oneness
[1:17:25] if you sit down with me and let me talk
[1:17:27] to you a long time I'll ask you a simple
[1:17:29] question let's see where you start
[1:17:33] a simple question
[1:17:35] is when does the first time in your
[1:17:37] thoughts does the Son of God come into
[1:17:39] being
[1:17:43] even your scholar says that word logos
[1:17:46] back there
[1:17:47] that created the world was the son of
[1:17:50] God
[1:17:53] that's why the man looked down in and he
[1:17:54] said didn't we throw four three men in
[1:17:56] and he says there's a four one down
[1:17:58] there and he said he'd like unto the son
[1:18:00] of God
[1:18:05] see that way I'm not a Oneness
[1:18:08] because I can follow God all the way
[1:18:10] through the Bible
[1:18:11] and bring it out to see him standing on
[1:18:13] the River Jordan
[1:18:16] body
[1:18:17] a man right but a special man
[1:18:22] everyone said no man could die like that
[1:18:25] man died
[1:18:27] he said he was almighty God in human
[1:18:29] flesh the Bible said he was a fullness
[1:18:32] of the godhead bodily
[1:18:37] he said but how could he die
[1:18:39] what died
[1:18:43] when Jesus Christ on that cross
[1:18:47] what did he say
[1:18:51] he stood into thy hands
[1:18:54] I'll come in my spirit
[1:18:59] death in the human body is a release of
[1:19:02] life that is within you blow my head off
[1:19:05] you have just released a life out of my
[1:19:09] body
[1:19:09] it will go somewhere else
[1:19:12] and be there
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:16] so when Jesus Christ hung our
[1:19:18] even brother Reynolds says God tore that
[1:19:22] soul out
[1:19:24] how much greater could you think about
[1:19:26] it
[1:19:27] he didn't want to release that
[1:19:30] come on nobody didn't want to release
[1:19:31] what was in it
[1:19:36] it's from me
[1:19:38] what's that never
[1:19:41] go ahead
[1:19:44] the body died
[1:19:48] the Soul and Spirit didn't die it was
[1:19:50] just released out of the body
[1:19:54] and that Soul was able to come back on
[1:19:56] the day of Pentecost that Spirit to
[1:19:58] anoint
[1:20:00] with that soul to give eternal life
[1:20:03] that way God could share his eternal
[1:20:05] life
[1:20:07] he is eternal life
[1:20:10] he could put it into you and I
[1:20:13] buy a new birth
[1:20:17] that's one true and living God Amen
[1:20:20] amen like I said it ain't Oneness God
[1:20:22] one this is a life's manifestation is
[1:20:24] Jesus right
[1:20:26] no
[1:20:28] I've done preach to you
[1:20:30] if you not to know the rest what I'm
[1:20:31] going to say come on he is the beginning
[1:20:34] of the creation of God we are the rest
[1:20:36] of that creation
[1:20:39] we are his offspring amen
[1:20:43] who's dwelling in your soul tonight it's
[1:20:45] either God or the devil one there ain't
[1:20:48] no in between
[1:20:50] got to be one or the other
[1:20:53] and if God is in there that's eternal
[1:20:55] life right
[1:20:59] see back there it was God With Us
[1:21:03] now is God in us
[1:21:08] think about it
[1:21:10] God's plan and purpose to share his
[1:21:14] eternal life
[1:21:18] ought to just be a savior A Healer as we
[1:21:20] keep saying it
[1:21:23] but to do what the word said that savior
[1:21:25] was going to do to do what the word says
[1:21:27] that healer is going to do
[1:21:29] one of these days he's going to heal
[1:21:31] these bodies right
[1:21:33] and they'll be eternal
[1:21:37] not to just stop death
[1:21:40] no he's going to take it right back
[1:21:43] to his purity
[1:21:47] one true and living God
[1:21:49] he had a plan and a purpose to share his
[1:21:52] eternal life
[1:21:58] we'll get to it Sunday where the Prophet
[1:22:00] says what
[1:22:01] he said Jesus gave me an inheritance he
[1:22:04] said I beg your pardon
[1:22:06] he said Jesus never gave you an
[1:22:08] inheritance
[1:22:14] don't you think about that until Sunday
[1:22:16] he never gave us an inheritance
[1:22:19] he paid the prize
[1:22:26] he paid the price
[1:22:28] he made the way
[1:22:35] see we're not one this Folk
[1:22:37] all right amen
[1:22:40] we've been down through there for 40
[1:22:41] something years preaching on how that he
[1:22:44] started back there and worked his way
[1:22:46] down
[1:22:48] through that Christ
[1:22:51] and then become human flesh
[1:22:54] upon Earth
[1:22:55] then release that Christ again until it
[1:22:58] could come back on you and I
[1:23:01] making us little Messiahs
[1:23:07] so truly when the bride realizes who she
[1:23:09] is
[1:23:10] and what's she here for
[1:23:13] we're here to strip Satan
[1:23:16] I've ever powered he ever thought he had
[1:23:19] because the one thing he still thinks
[1:23:21] he's got is death
[1:23:23] but just remember and I love it where
[1:23:25] the Prophet said when you come up to a
[1:23:27] certain place he said God took a picture
[1:23:30] you just took a picture he said okay
[1:23:32] come on devil
[1:23:33] do all you want to I said you can't take
[1:23:36] his life until I'm through with him
[1:23:43] you can't do it
[1:23:47] go somebody's there to take care of it
[1:23:52] take on these things do you see his plan
[1:23:54] and his purpose
[1:23:57] share his life
[1:24:03] this is a many-membered body
[1:24:09] a born-again believer
[1:24:14] with the same life
[1:24:16] that their father had
[1:24:18] because it is their father's life in
[1:24:20] them
[1:24:21] that's why Paul could say it's not I
[1:24:22] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:24:25] and the life that I now live in the
[1:24:27] flesh I live what by thee faith
[1:24:31] of the son of God
[1:24:38] do we see it come on brother
[1:24:42] what is eternal life
[1:24:49] there's only one form
[1:24:51] of eternal life
[1:24:58] and that's God's own life
[1:25:02] God's own life
[1:25:06] to come into you and I
[1:25:08] make us
[1:25:10] his children
[1:25:15] we are as people and the Sheep of his
[1:25:17] pasture
[1:25:20] why can't we read those scriptures and
[1:25:22] see all of those things back there
[1:25:26] remember he could read it and see
[1:25:27] himself
[1:25:29] why can't we read it see ourselves
[1:25:32] I'll run through what David said I'll
[1:25:34] run through when they said I run through
[1:25:36] a troop and leap over a wall run around
[1:25:39] and said from natural to Supernatural
[1:25:41] he said that'll take place one day
[1:25:46] but it's not going to take place
[1:25:48] except in that little ride
[1:25:53] it's for her and her only
[1:25:56] foolish virgins
[1:25:59] doesn't make him what he wanted
[1:26:04] Angels created
[1:26:06] worship Him don't make him what he
[1:26:08] wanted
[1:26:11] The Offspring of God
[1:26:14] is what's going to make him what he
[1:26:15] wants
[1:26:18] you know I've never
[1:26:21] thought
[1:26:22] or even had any concept or thought
[1:26:25] of having children that would be perfect
[1:26:29] now I know you think yours are but
[1:26:31] that's all right I do two in my ways but
[1:26:37] I realized that when kids come into the
[1:26:39] world they're going to be kids
[1:26:42] and they're going to do funny goofy
[1:26:44] things
[1:26:45] because they're kids
[1:26:48] you know and we've done them too
[1:26:51] a lot of times a whole lot goofier
[1:26:57] come on you see the kids out there
[1:26:59] we had our bell bottom pants
[1:27:04] turtleneck sweater
[1:27:06] and ducktail haircuts
[1:27:10] flat tire
[1:27:13] we had our day
[1:27:17] they're just kids
[1:27:21] I don't look at anybody when they do
[1:27:22] something wrong like that man up there
[1:27:24] that killed all them kids and all you
[1:27:26] know what
[1:27:27] he's just lost
[1:27:32] if he could have got salvation
[1:27:34] he wouldn't want to kill nobody
[1:27:37] he's just lost
[1:27:39] you see a prostitute doing what to do
[1:27:41] they're just lost
[1:27:44] they can't they don't need to expect
[1:27:46] them to do anything else
[1:27:49] but
[1:27:50] if we say we're Christians
[1:27:52] then we're supposed to all walk like
[1:27:54] them right act like them do like them
[1:27:57] sing like them listen
[1:28:00] 539 created me a clean heart I mean
