bless amen we do to all of those that are listening in and and everything all right Genesis 2 and 1 Corinthians 15 had a real good time this past weekend with brother Reed and I hope you did and fellowship doing on the Lord willing now brother for is supposed to be with us this coming Wednesday if we can make sure but we'll go ahead and announce he will be here but then just remember that things can change but anyhow then brother Ron Spencer will be here with us on October the 29th and 30th which that'll be a Saturday night service 7:00 and then a morning service on Sunday and we're having a dinner together and no Sunday afternoon service on that weekend so just remember that amen all right Genesis 2 1 Corinthians 15 father we thank you we love you we ask you to just have your way with each and every one of us we pray that you would just bless us with th understanding with your presence and Lord all of those that are listening in tonight and viewing and things Lord we pray that you'd bless them and Lord Just Have Your Way let your light shine in each one of our hearts and lives what a wonderful day it is an hour to be living upon the Earth the greatest of all times is here upon us and Lord we rejoice in that so then do as we were singing Just Open the Eyes of our heart Lord that we may see you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Genesis 2 we'll read verse 8 and N9 the Lord God planted a garden planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground made he the made the Lord to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now remember all the trees were there but then there was two trees cuz that's what we're going to be speaking about a little bit is those two trees cuz I believe they're still here amen CU it's not natural trees it wasn't an apple tree an orange tree or whatever you know amen it wasn't in that okay now let's go to 1 Corinthians 15: 20 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death By Man Al came also the resurrection of the dead as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all all authority and power for he must reain till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we come down through our studies and I had kind of forgotten that I was supposed to speak on this and you know trying to move on into the to the uh preaching and uh you know so I decided that I just drop back and put in a message tonight on this to where that we could could uh follow the thought you remember we spent about probably eight messages speaking of about heaven and how real it is and and God and how real he is and and then coming down to the garden and and the things and and taking place there in the garden and what happened with Eve and uh but I want you to think about something there was two trees there right we read all right the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen now as I said it's not two apple it's not an apple tree and an orange tree or some kind of a trees we know who that was the the tree of life is Jesus Christ amen and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is Satan right in his perversion but now here's what I want you to look at because it's a very odd scripture especially in the way we think uh we read here that The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death amen right well see now that you know that's an odd way of saying it because I thought Jesus Christ destroyed every enemy right but there's one enemy to be destroyed and that's death right so now what is death why would it state it that way that The Last Enemy that shall be you know right the other scripture we come on over and and talking about Jesus and it says that that we don't see all things but said we see Jesus all right now so don't lose me in the thought of what I'm trying to get Jesus Christ paid the price for everything right amen but there's one enemy that has not been destroyed and that is death amen you said yeah he destroyed death at Calvary okay now follow me throughout the message and you'll get a point death for the soul has been destroyed because we have the new birth that's right that destroys death to the soul amen but it doesn't destroy dying of the human body right amen so that's why Paul is saying The Last Enemy to be destroyed that shall Bey one day will be death amen but what truly is death death brother Mo I remember about 40 something years ago he made the statement he said you can't know what life is unless you know what death is and that's been with me ever since because you know I like to look at things of that order but Paul said The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death amen MH right now why would it be made that way why wouldn't why wouldn't Paul say way cuzz he's talking about Jesus Christ and his death and his the resurrection and Etc coming on through why wouldn't he say that you know we see everything destroyed right because he knew man was still dying that's right as long as we're dying then The Last Enemy is not destroyed right you say well yes it is brother it's been well you're dying right you want to tell me you're not getting older that's right you want to argue about the white hires and no hires or whatever you know I mean just look in the mirror and you'll find out that the light enemy has not been destroyed yet all right so if the light enemy has not been destroyed which is physical death all right right amen come on that's right physical death is not destroyed the price has been paid everything's been done but there's something about that that leavs death to be taking all of us right right that's right it took the prophet even in his greatest of understanding it took him to a natural death that's right amen all right MH now so then what is death death is the first death in the natural in the Bible was when Kan killed AEL right Genesis 4 but see death was there before then yep what happened with Cain and Abel was that Cain put forth the attribute of what his death he had within him right Cain was had already experienced death he said wait a minute Kan G was live see then you're not listening right when Cain turned down the revealed word he was dead amen right amen you following me am he was spiritually dead amen right amen when he turned down the revealed word when Abel told him what God had told him that was the revealed word right so death was back there behind or back before the natural act the natural Act of Abel and Cain was the attribute of kain's death right that he had already working within him amen so then death was the thing that happened when Eve disbelieved God's word she spiritually died right and not physically right we're going to get to that in a minute now so you're going to have to hold tight with me tonight and listen so what is that death see we say death is well you go down to the Undertaker and the guy's laying in the coffin you know well that's de no that's the attribute see the reason we're dying is because of the disbelieve in God's word right right that causes the physical death that's right when we come to a place listen when we get to the place that spiritual death is conquered within you and I then and then only can natural death be destroyed that's what Paul's saying he saying we see Jesus we see these things you know through his writings but it said we're still physically dying right all right so then if we're physically dying something's wrong mhm right you said well what we need to do is is to to get dying stopped maybe we can find some kind of appe peel some kind of a a a a a thing to be given to a person you know that can reverse it boy you'd be instantly Rich if you could you know but there's no such thing Pon Leon never found the Fountain of Youth I think he was a one hunting part wouldn't he that's right travel across the country trying to find a fountain of youth you know what he believes somebody's lie right cuz somebody lied to the old boy right somebody told him way over there you know you get over there and you'll find a fountain of youth well now wouldn't that kind of like what happened in heaven as we've been talking about that the Angels believe Satan's lie yeah right and then in the garden yep Eve believed Satan's lie MH right it brought spiritual death right right cuz the day you eat thereof that day you die amen she died spiritually that's right all right but she didn't die physically Noe that's right that was a 100 or 200 or 400 years I don't know how old she ever Liv I don't really know where there's a record of Adam and Eve in their amount of time to live but are you following what I'm saying that right so death is not the fact of somebody cutting your throat and your heart quits beating that's the attribute of what really death truly is Right amen go death is to disbelief God's word amen all right now what I want to do is read something to you I won't try to explain it until later end of the message all right but I want to to read it to you so go ahead brother and pull it up so let's just read something brother right and say it you might I'm going to ask you a question when I finish with this that might be a shock to you all right so just think about these things brother R starts off on paragraph 90 this will be 90 91 93 on through in the breach which is in the seal book said as when a person is struck with disease aches and pains one time there wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had help and when Nature and people as the Bible said are groaning it shows there something that they're not in ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere right now immediately get the point while he's rolling it up to paragraph 91 get the point that I want you to to Exel that this is not just talking about Adam and Eve right all right I'll repeat this in a minute but I want that in your mind this is not just talking about Adam and Eve that's what he's just saying he's talking about a person that's struck with a disease it's talking about T die right it's talking about us y right all right see now he goes to express the thought and look what he says now we don't need no anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we know it was eternal life that they had fallen from now that's I said I'm not going to explain this for a few minutes but I want this into to your thought and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve see so it's not talking just Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam and an animal an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's Eternal that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God but when we died as I said in the message this morning to sin we sold out our Birthright and crossed this CM now we're beyond the reach of God on this other side of the castle right so now he's not just talking about Adam and Eve he's talking about all of us so get the story now now what now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given through more agen it was given to them just as we so to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree said before each and and every one of us see God isn't doing for Adam or for Eve you said well it isn't their fault no not now it isn't it's your fault you can't place it on Adam now you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we're on the same basis as Adam and Eve all right now so my point is what I want to ask you a question I spoke on this line before on many things and we'll get back to it in a little bit all right but I want to ask you a question is it possible that we could fall the same way Adam and Eve fell ain't got no amens or nowhere yet ain't even got a headshake but uh you know that when I ask the question sometimes it's better to wait for a while to find out what I'm talking about but is it possible tonight because we' just shown by the prophet that that's not just talking about Adam and Eve that's talking about all mankind right and that we're in the same situation y that Adam and Eve was in right right so now keep that in mind is it possible that we can fall the same way that Adam and Eve fell in the garden now write these down brother life in want to go but they couldn't read when I wrote but that's all right I try to read it if it don't get too cold I can read it but a few days later I have to figure out what I'm saying but I just ask you to do one thing with me tonight don't try to figure out what I'm saying I I'll tell you what I'm going to say now that's where people gets me confused see they they don't listen to the words I use right they just something is said in their computer go click because how many of you click when I ask the question is it possible that we could fall like Adam and Eve your computer clicks and sometimes you don't listen to the rest of the message but I would listen and maybe even go back and play the tape if you need to don't try to interpret me just listen to what I say and then we'll ask God to try to interpret it to all of us all right see by the fall of Adam and Eve it brought the whole human race into a lost condition we lost our claim on eternal life now read this in a minute we lost our claim on eternal Life by Adam and Eve the same two trees sets before us today amen that's right that set before Adam and Eve we must decide which tree we're going to eat off of right amen that's right my brother D I'm just I'm just simpleminded and I'm just I just love the Lord and I'm just eating off the tree of life uh we were studying there in the bible study this past Saturday night and you know that Paul made an outstanding statement he had spent his entire life serving the great Jehovah God you agree right amen studying preparing to either be a the prophet said a lawyer or even a priest yet he made an outstanding statement he said the thing that I thought was life I found to be death you remember that in the scripture right the thing that I thought was life what was he talking about the keeping of the law right or the law the Commandments of God the word of God and you know if Christ did not come he would have been all right right that's right true right amen cuz he was keeping the law right that's right he would have had to been judged by the law right or the Commandments right but when Christ came he saw that those Commandments was not a book of rules but it was a revelation of the person of almighty God right and see to him was to follow it by natural carnal or excuse me natural reading not to call it carnal because we're you know he thought by studying the word and keeping the word to the letter right was his salvation yeah what about it what about you and I which tree are we eating off of now the question comes up about what the prophet had to say he said Adam and Eve he said we fa all of us Adam and Eve fail from eternal life to death y in the garden now what is he talking about well he you said what he talking about fell from eternal life to death in the garden he he just said it he's he just he he's plain he made himself plain but can you fall from eternal life is it possible to fall from eternal life well it looks like that's what the prophet is saying but what truly is death death was already in the garden before Cain killed Abel right death was for Eve to accept Satan's lie right amen right it brought her to death all right what happened to her she died remember a Eve had the word that told her cuz Genesis 2 you know he's put into the to the U flesh right remember all right now even though Eve maybe was not standing there right at the position we read the scripture of she comes into being in Genesis 2 and if she does she's told maybe if not at by God himself being revealed because you could narrow it down and argue over Genesis 2 whether it would be Eve and Adam both standing there when God said you don't eat right just a few verses over from where we read he said don't you eat of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he says don't even touch it right amen so whether Eve was standing there or not is beside the point because Adam would have finally told her when she come into big right right don't eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil don't touch it cuz you do you'll die right right cuz Satan comes along to right and as he comes along and he starts explaining and she she starts doing her preaching job she's telling him you know oh yeah we need every one of these trees but one tree y cuz see Satan said can you eat of all the trees tricking her into starting preaching that's right women preachers all right we'll get to it in a minute because see to believe Satan's lie to serve Satan and that's why you can't tell them brother R said cuz they're anointed right right that's right can you tell a woman preacher that she's not she don't have the right to preach she'll tell you in a hurry God called her and probably could out preach a lot of men they ain't got nothing to do with it right amen that's beside the point you see we look at things like death as just somebody physically dying but what is the reason for us dying why are we dying it's not because we're getting old cuz some of us are a whole lot older than others I'm 71 years old and if I live another hour like brother Brandon would say he said I would outlive a many a young person right that's right right see why why are we dying this physical death is an attribute of the unbelief that's been brought into being into our because of all of us eating off the tree of knowledge see that's why I say we we we today can eat off that tree of knowledge just as well as anybody else no no no brother I'm a Christian all right why would you say the prophet say only Christians have sins right you have to argue with him about some things but see if we accept Satan's life we're dead just like Eve was right right what's the difference in me and you accepting Satan lie or Eve accepting him right come on what's the difference I mean it can't be any difference in it and it's just one lie right amen now surely you would agree with this statement I had rather die naturally than to die spiritually right when you agree with that I had rather die naturally amen that's right than in any way to die spiritually right why because look what spiritual death will do to you all right yep go ahead brother paragraph 137 trying to do God a service without his will look what the prophet has to say many sincere persons go join an organization or a group or a cult of some sort and dare they die spiritually you can't tell them nothing they get that stuff drilled into them why these Bishops said this and this said this this said this you show them right here in the word of God where it's thus sayith the Lord but our pastor I don't care what your pastor says Now read this one don't care what I say y Now read it off the screen he said I don't care what your pastor said don't care what I say or anybody else says if it's contrary to God's Vindicated word of the of the hour the time the message and so forth forget it stay away from it amen that's spiritual death right amen is to take any thought whatsoever right contrary y to God's word Amen to even just to say well in a way that might be right is to take Satan's life right and brings us to spiritual death you say I I can't be in spiritual death brother the de I I'm born again we're going to solve the problem in a minute will to see what the prophet had to say going down to the next one Discerning the body of the Lord page 14 1959 812 let's discern the body of the Lord discern the times that we're living in we'll die spiritually if we don't do that now he could say We'll he you know he didn't say y'all Let's see we got to change that now we got to race up that wheel there and we'll change it to y'all will die spiritually now he says we'll die spiritually if we don't do that and if that is true and the Holy Spirit is with us we got the LIF sign of the coming of the Lord all right now you say what are you trying to get to can you fall now it order to be a simple matter for us to look around at ourselves and see we're getting older that's right right and there's something causing that and it's called spiritual dying spiritual death to turn down the word of God is spiritual death and we can do that maybe lack of understanding maybe to the point that we've listened listen to as he said the Bishops yeah we form Cults and things and what's wrong with the end time people spiritually dying what keeps taking us down turning down the revealed word right now remember I brought it his b as I could because you can't turn down something that you had never heard right so don't misunderstand me but if you've heard it and turn it down I reject it no matter who does the preaching would it been all right with bam to have rejected what the dumb donkey had to say not exactly right Peter listened to a rooster preaching one day when he growed three times right get your eyes off of what you're looking at and get your your ears open to the spiritual understanding of God's word cuz that's what's killing us cuz you know yourself that the mo most of the people this message are name pre name following preachers in other words the big people the ones that's got the big names and the and the things they can say what they want to and even say brother Brandon was wrong yeah even say Jesus was wrong and like I said the other day see then I can sit down in front of you and say brother do you know that brother so and so has said that I've heard 15 sermons ain't never heard him say that well I say name the dates well that was the one I listened to where he said it right y see we get all caught up into the big things instead of listening to what said right I didn't know faith comes because we get so anointed I thought it come because of hearing amen amen well you don't want me to no I've told you I've told you over and over here listen to who you want to but when that comes back in here that I don't agree with I will address it because I'm the amen but now think about it can you fall from eternal life right can you have eternal life and lose it we're not talking about anointed ones now we're not talking about anything we're talking about genuine bonifide Born Again Christ Christian look at number four paragraph 599 of the Hebrews chapter 6 Mark 3 said you'll make mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong that's where people said no you can't willfully do wrong be a Christian well brother Rand just said you will do it so you go ahead right you go out sometimes and do things that don't mean that you're lost that means that you're going to get correction all right so now he's explaining it comes on down to paragraph 601 it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again that's once been born to eternal life God is not an Indian giver he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come to the Judgment but is pass from Death In The Life I'll raise him up at the last days that's God's promise it's impossible for the person to have eternal life and lose it you reading it right it's impossible to have eternal life and lose it because that's right God's not an ending Giver now how many would you like on that point but that's just just to make sure you get it look down at the next one baptism of the Holy Spirit paragraph 5958 9:28 morning service but when a man or a woman has been born in the spirit of God all things have passed away all things have become new he's been birthed and blessed by the Eternal God they can no more perish than God himself can perish do you mean to tell me that a god an infinite God would come down and give you eternal life knowing that he was going to lose you save you here knowing he's going to lose you there what did he save you for why he's working against himself if he saved you once you saved for all eternity there's no demons in Hell could upset you now so we're making a statement you can't fall from eternal life look at the next one here your himym paragraph or E36 57 5198 Ser that when a man is born or a son that he's a Son of God that's right and God wouldn't save you here knowing he was going to lose you there you might be worked up and think you're saved here that might be true but let me tell you something when you're really saved God don't save you here and know he's going to lose you there if he did he's not the infinite God he's defeating his own purpose he can't do that if you're saved you're saved if you're not you're not and if you're saved you live like you're saved all right now so the prophet states that you can't fall from etern eternal life God's not going to give you eternal life and take it back away from you right no all right so what happened in the garden what took place in the garden we're going to come back to that first quote in a minute did Adam have eternal life amen in his soul yes amen right all right let's establish that he did Blasphemous names paragraph 184 62 11:04 the morning service you read all of it come on down breath the breath is not the soul back up to the top let's read all the way down brother excuse me but now here's je whole witness in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is the soul now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not the soul if it is you're one time one kind of a soul next time you're somebody else has breathe that soul look where you'd be now the breath is wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils all right now now they take the scripture from back and God breathed breath into his nostrils and he became a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of of life into him see what kind of breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then ever animals is living Soul because they breathe a human soul and our soul and all together then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient so brother the argument don't stand see the amoya the African word amoya is like you breathe in and breathe out and brother Bram I gave it the other day on a message where he said if that would be true then you wouldn't have to seek the Holy Ghost cuz it just come in as your breathing it right but that can't be true amen amen Theo you the breath you breathe is not it it's the soul amen listen but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life watch it amen then he became a living Soul a soul that can't die now watch we're going to get into honey Plum up to Plum to your elbows notice breathe a breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul now who's he talking about Adam right right cuz God breathed not what nature done but what God did breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul then you say to me Adam died brother random go ahead and R brother but but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those who he forne he has called he got he got a lamb to redeem them he was a typ Adam fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal the Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was the son of God not his breath as the amoyal word I don't know what the Greek word is for right now but the African word they call it which means to win an unseen Force so what Adam had eternal life amen all right let's see go to paragraph 189 then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathed into us by the breath why would we struggle for eternal life it backfires brother see it it it just can't do it but God espcially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power of God he was an amateure God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the Earth right all right so Adam had eternal life amen in his soul amen right okay that's right now then that looks like it's contrary to what we read in the beginning because we what we read in the beginning it looked like Adam had it and fell from it right let's read a couple more then we'll back up to that look at number seven let's see women now we already pass that U let me get my notes together number eight let's see what happened in the garden that's right let's read what happened really in the garden cuz this is taken for the breach uh you know the seal book 1963 317 paragraph 102 see Adam lost his inheritance yep the Earth that's right what was Adam's inheritance the Earth okay now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reason therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth to the Earth belong to him and he forfeited to every every bit to the hands of Satan he pasted it from his hands now you know what it may be on the next quote but you know what brother R said it couldn't go back to Satan he said went back to God right okay keep keep on reading look at paragraph 116 now for now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner see now the there where he comes back up almighty God the title deed to the Earth see that's why you can read one quote make brother around say anything you want to but keep on reading to see what he say now the for title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're going to find it just in the money so we drop down and you keep reading about the abstract title de to eternal life when Adam forfeited it for wisdom and instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner paragraph 123 same breach message God's law required an instant substitute itute and who was innocent every man had been born bisexual after sex everyone the only one that wasn't was he talking about Adam right had forfeited the rights to eternal life and to be king of the earth so what happened in the garden what is death to turn down the revealed word of God Amen I don't ask you to agree with me because especially for the next few minutes I would just sit and listen I'm just honest cuz I got something to say to you if you don't agree with me then we'll talk later about it that's all right I'm just trying to make a point we've read it look like we've read that Adam had eternal life in his soul that's right we're not talking about Body Spirit or anything we're talking about his soul we proved that all right we prove that Adam lost something in the garden the rulership of the earth and the right to eternal life we proved that you cannot lose eternal life right right cuz God's not an ending Giver okay so what took place in the garden this is I said it and I'll go ahead and make it because I got it WR on my notes so I believe that you and I can fall tonight just like Adam and Eve fell I believe we are falling we're falling every moment just like Adam and Eve fell now how did Adam and Eve fall right what took place in the garden that is still taking place today you say Brother D are you talking about Christians Born Again Christians right right I believe us as Born Again Christians are still falling just like Adam and Eve fell right right I'll take a little explaining on there what happened to Adam and Eve in the garden Brother Anderson go back to number one on your notes the breach paragraph 9091 through 93 he didn't know he was going to do it this way I wanted him to be thanking also as well as anyone but all of us so let's read what the prophet had to say that when a person is struck you can read it by sin and then we're groaning we're groaning now right many sick among us I forgot to tell it too uh you know my uh white blood Camp I forgot to announce it Sunday you know my white blood Camp back when I was having the temperature and all of the sickness with the sinuses and thing it it jumped from 17 to 40 and they got worried about it I just kept saying well I'm Healed it don't make no difference well we finally went back and they said well it's dropped from 40 now remember I I stated it cuz I'm sure it was not it was on 17 the blood count white blood count and it went excuse me 22 now why I saying 22 cuz I think it was may have been 22 I know that it was right in there all right it went up to 40 the next test they run it was down to 29 the doctor says well great said it's on its way down normal is from 4 to 10 that right sah she's taking her head she's a nurse we got T so they kept saying well okay let's run some more tests and see it dropped down to 29 and went back up and I said sit there in the office and I said Lord just let the thing drop on down to where it'll prove what's going on now remember it started at 22 they ran their test and it was on 14 amen he went down lower than it was to start with amen he's still in the healing business you think I'm worried about what no but now listen we're all grown in sickness among us what we know we know we've fallen from somewhere right right right Adam and Eve in the garden the prophet said said that their youth was being renewed daily all right amen now which meant Adam was not Eternal in body right he was only Eternal in his soul right amen he was not Eternal in his body right right his youth was being renewed daily evidently he must have not have been Eternal in spirit because after all that was said and done he sold the human race y That's right yep and he was a child of God remember amen the first son that's right the Bible says and Adam all die we read well ago right that's right so Adam and body he was not Eternal in spirit he was not eternal in his soul he was eternal right now go down to paragraph 91 now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us we know it was eternal life they' fallen from now brother Brandon they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve which means all of us who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature unto them to death right now how can you fall from eternal life I had just tried person tried to explain that to me one time said that was just Adam well you can take that point if you want to and go ahead but where does that put you I say church that we are doing the same thing today that Adam and Eve done in the garden we're dying I'll let you think what is brother randam saying when he's already said you can't fall from eternal life right if you're saved you're saved amen what's he saying now what happened to Adam and Eve in the garden and you'll see that the same things taking place right here today Adam never lost eternal life in his soul that's right he lost the right to the tree of life right amen you agree amen no matter what else You' agree with in the message you would agree with that he lost a right to the tree of life amen because his body was not Eternal right amen right so he fell from that body come into a position of Eternity right are you he fell from the position that he should have reached right had he stayed with the word the tree of life was standing there they could have eventually partook of the tree of life right but once they had fallen in their unbelief and brought death into their beings of natural God had to put them out cuz he said we got to get them out here because not they will partake of the tree of life and live will watch forever cuz you can't have an eternal sinner right the Bible doesn't say that read your Bible it says we got to put them out unless they partake of the tree of life and live forever right amen cuz had they been able to got to that tree of life they could have lived forever but they couldn't lived eternally right no not a difference in eternity and forever that's right amen see Adam and Eve fell from a position of rulership of the Earth right and the right to partake of that tree of life and come to eternal life in Body Spirit and soul right but they had eternal life in their soul they never lost eternal life in their soul that's right and neither was I saying what you might have thought I was saying when I asked the question can we fall the same way you cannot have eternal life and lose it right that's right there is no way right you can't have eternal life in your soul and lose eternal life in your soul you can't have it no amen Adam never lost his eternal life in his soul he lost the right to the tree of life that would have given him eternity in All Phases and would have finally brought the world to eternal life that's right all right right now we're back word that most of you know that I preached over the years that Adam lost coming to eternal life it was right there right come on if the tree of knowledge was there and the Tree of Life was there then the tree of life was right there for them to to partake of right Y and I've told you my definition you can do what you want to you think what you want do about it but had sin not entered the picture now are you listening to my statement had sin not come to to p through Adam and Eve then God would have allowed them to spoke us into existence and the g the Genesis 1:26 and 27 people which would be the children of God would have walked right out there in human bodies right with eternal Souls right cuz God would have breathed into our nostrils the breath of eternal life had they not been a fall and then we could have all went to the tree of life right and our bodies would have made been made Eternal then for our bodies to be made Eternal the world and all things would have been made Eternal but that didn't happen right but what's the difference in what happened right amen is it not true that you receive eternal life by accepting Jesus Christ as your savior amen that gives you eternal life in your soul but that don't make your body and your spirit Eternal and are we not going to the tree of life which is the word of God are we not eating of this every day as we read it or are you reading gre's Almanac you won't find this in gre's ALC I used to say that in Jamaica and they couldn't figure it out cuz they got a McDonald's alac They don't have a GRE way that interpret tell them what I'm saying but listen this is my final statements of what I'm talking about see you and I have eternal life in our soul right by the new birth you agree amen yes sir all right making you a child of God you cannot be lost right but now if we don't partake of the tree of life which is the word of God you know what's going to happen right we're going by the grave right wasn't that exactly what have happened to Adam and Eve right didn't not Adam and Eve go by the grave that's right Amen brother Brandon said one of these days Adam will raise up and reach over and catch Eve and eveil raise and she'll catch able Seth and the L come up and right up through it'll go right why because Adam never lost eternal life in his soul that's right he lost a right to come he forfeited there over in there we talking about he forfeited his right right yeah he forfeited the right to eternal life right you and I are forfeiting it right now come on right y by not believing the revealed word of God we're forfeiting our right to the tree of life right we're dying right amen well we're going to die to death no no the Bible says somebody's going to be changed come on we're forgetting that scripture somebody's going to be changed in a moment the twinkle an eye somebody's not going to let death take them right right now we're back where we started what is death to reject the revealed word of God is death right come on we're dying because yep that we're not believing God's word as I said when I started the Bible said every enemies has been destroyed but death now listen Jesus Christ destroyed death right right come on Amen it's not something that's got to be done right he destroyed death he destroyed natural death he destroyed spiritual death that's right amen that's what he's coming back in the end time right it's only here in the end time that the bride of Christ is to catch who they are and what's going on Amen and to take this message and walk straight into eternal life amen Body Spirit and soul amen while we're right here on the Earth cuz that's what the Bible says the moment you change the moment twinkle ey the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are are alive and remain shall be changed come on it's happen going to happen right here that's right somebody's going to believe the revealed word somebody's going to turn down Satan's lie that says see then he said You shall not die to Eve but you know what he's saying now he saying you can't make it y that's right cuz everybody died before you right but that's a lie amen Jesus Christ never died he rose that I might be able to live amen Paul said we may not see all things but said we see Jesus that's right who's made a little lower than the Angels Amen to suffer in honor and Glory are you listening to what I said then I believe that you and I can fall just like Adam and Eve fell and I just proved my point of what I was talking about whether you would believe it or not but they never lost eternal life they only lost a right to the tree of life and the the the living upon the Earth in an eternal being right and that's what we're doing yep right instead of believing who we are and what God has said we are instead of taking what he says about us we're still taking what the do doctor say come on when are we going to start facing them I don't there nothing wrong with going to the doctors I go to everybody brother Randon went to the doctor he's out there in Grace Valley California 1962 going to the doctor every day so sick in his stomach he couldn't stand it and the sick being healed the dead being raised in the meetings and him going to the doctor what does that got to do with it right when that doctor says hey this is it I say no it ain't right that's right they told me I had leukemia I didn't argue fuss with nobody I said no chemo he said Sam it's different I said it ain't different you know it you're in the business on that end of it it's way I talked to the doctor I said you know what it'll do to you I said I'm on the business on the other end that I sit there and watch people die and you tell them you can give him 6 months if they take Kemo and burn him up they burn my poor old mother-in-law to the point she was cooked literally cooked I ain't kidding you the skin was broke standing out it was cooked and then tell you well we'll give you 6 months God help me I tell them said give forget it cuz I'm telling you by St I'm Healed amen that's right brother D what you tell no sir I will not tell my family I will not tell anybody else not to take chemo no way it's just me the where I stand he said when you'll change your mind when it comes down to it will L see right cuz what's my what's the thing of a Christian to want to live six more mon I'd like to go home right now wouldn't you are we in that joke real amen are we still in the joke real you know you know what it is about it well yeah I want to go in the Rapture one of these days but I thought you was talking about going right now you know the bus pulling up making a joke out of it I'm ready to go now come Lord quickly get us out of here he said no there's more to be saved don't worry about it there a Rapture took place this ain't no more to be saved come on let's get it straight in line we're falling from eternal life because we are accepting what death is death is the carnality of the human mind right right you know yourself that what I'm telling you is the truth people can take their human mind soul being and bend metal crack glass do all kind of thing walk on colds of fire ask these are sitting here about their karate that they taught them to bypass the human mind and they can break a block but you look at the Block and you can't break it it'll break your fist come on we're accepting death what we're doing doing oh I just don't feel like it I go to church I just don't feel like it I thought the church was Place supposed to be at when we sick right I mean I don't understand it I'm just honest now right I thought that's where we're supposed to be when we're sick y That's right well no no no no we don't we don't need them here because they might have a disease I have finally broke down on my car I never would State make this statement till now if you got some disease that somebody else can catch go to the basement and we'll get some of us that are believe enough and come down and pray with you but don't stay at home yeah well I don't want nobody else to get you're using the excuse right y they finally brought a little bottle up here cuz I know what some people's minds are some people's minds that they don't like for me to break bread when I'm coughing and holding my hand up and going they don't want me to break the bread so I'll take the stuff and wipe it off why for you that don't mean a thing to me I pray for 90% of you never put oil on I don't care oil in my pocket that's right come on I'm not against that I know what the prophet is said I know what the Bible said that oil is supposed to protect you right but if that Holy Ghost inside of me can't protect me then there's something wrong with the Holy Ghost inside of me you mean I'm afraid to go in a room where somebody's sick don't you go in there now you'll get it with my Lord yeah that's what's killing us that's right that's right they told Brother around don't you go down there with that your wife you'll get that disease and take it home to your boy he sneaked around went downstairs went inside and sat down with his wife he wasn't afraid right see fear is our worst enemy a fear of failing don't worry about it we are failing to start with right we're born failures so that's why I said Adam and Eve never lost eternal life in their soul they lost the right to come to the body being changed and made Eternal and ownership of the earth that's exactly what you and I are doing right now right right we're allowing Satan to tell us these things tell us how sick we are when are we going to start saying by strips I'm Healed well you just never ain't never been as sick as I have all right that's an excuse yeah which means that little tongue's flapping inside of your mouth is lying to you right when are we going to start saying by Stripes I'm Healed when are we going to start saying I'm changed you know somebody's going to have to say it for it to come to pass come on yeah what's God waiting on he's waiting on you and I what's the world waiting on you and I to come to the place we saying we are the people of God and we're here for this purpose that's right and death can't take me you say well one of these days you might do it brother Dale well if it does just remember yeah I did say that I believe it that's now you make it manifest and bring me out of the Grave yeah that's right you believe it extend on it until God reveals it to you and makes it to where you can see it amen when are we going to start saying What God Says amen he says we're already healed he says we're already saved that's right when are we going to start saying it and I'm not saying don't say you're don't go around and say brother de said for me not to say I'm hurt so I'm not really hurt you're lying forget it you're lying what's Say by St I'm Healed I'm hurting so bad give me something for it right my stries I'm he do you ever talk to God that way do you ever tell him you love him now wake up in the middle of the night I say Lord I love you that's what my finger is going up like that been really cute about that part that sign language means I love you I told God years ago I said when I raise my hands I want you to know I love you I'm raised up to him I love you because you're a people of God but I love him first I love my wife my kids my grandkids my great grandkids and daughter-in-laws and son-in-law and I love but I love God more than I love anybody else cuz by he's made me what I am let's stand come on Brothers come on let's just sing and worship and believe and see God is real amen you get confused on what I said tonight I ask you twice to go and listen to the T you said but Brother D I heard you say it I've had people to tell me that I've had people tell me right it was you said so and so I said well we'll just get to table and see because that's what your mind was set on when you heard it you heard what you wanted to hear you didn't hear what I said I said Adam and Eve never fail from eternal life in their soul but they fail from coming to eternal life right and that's exactly what you and I are doing we have eternal life in our soul and we're going to go by the grave if we don't stand up and say this is the word and this is it we're going by the grave I said that how many years ago 30 40 I stood right here and said that there'll be a lot of people die that's in this message and not to go by the grave I said cuz it won be able to stand there for that change I may be one of them but I said it and I believe it right that's been 30 something years ago because I saw that what we're doing death is any interpretation that I have that is not exactly with this word right that's death any thought I have all right where's your women preachers yeah just one point where are they at brother Brown said I'm not going to tell you that God didn't call you I'm just going to tell you it's not in the word that's right cuz you can't tell them that's and North not brother said that's why you can't tell them women it's wrong to do that he said because they are anointed with the Holy Spirit y on their spirit and will not listen right
