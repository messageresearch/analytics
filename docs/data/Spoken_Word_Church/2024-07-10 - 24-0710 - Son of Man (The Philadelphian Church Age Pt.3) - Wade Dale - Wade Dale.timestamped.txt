[17:03] amen we're on the son of man we're on
[17:06] the Philadelphia and church age now for
[17:07] those of you that are that are visitors
[17:10] there was seven Church ages in the Bible
[17:12] they were in The Book of Revelations you
[17:14] can read them for yourself Revelations 1
[17:16] 2 and three you will see that God
[17:20] brought a message to a group of people
[17:23] he brought it to the world but only a
[17:25] group of people is going to receive it
[17:26] all right and only a group of people's
[17:29] going to receive this message and he
[17:31] gave us seven stars in the hand which
[17:33] are seven Messengers he gave us seven
[17:35] Church ages and you and I are in the
[17:38] last one there is no other Church age we
[17:39] are in the leot and church age and boy
[17:42] do not we know we're in leot and church
[17:44] age blind wretched miserable naked and
[17:47] doesn't know it all right but now we're
[17:50] we've come through the church ages and
[17:52] now we're in the Philadelphian Church
[17:54] age which is the messenger was John
[17:56] Wesley and we'll talk about that just a
[17:59] little bit so let's read our scripture
[18:01] that we've been reading Revelations
[18:03] 1:1 I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[18:05] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[18:07] of a trumpet saying I am Alpha what is
[18:10] that Alpha is the Greek first letter
[18:13] Omega is the last so it's I am the first
[18:15] and the last and what thou seest write
[18:17] in a book and send it to the seven
[18:19] churches which are in Asia now we want
[18:22] to compare that too with with Paul Paul
[18:25] sent messages and letters your whole old
[18:28] Test newest Testament he got the Old
[18:30] Testament wrote letters to churches in
[18:33] the New Testament and that was the
[18:35] Bible that was the Bible being written
[18:37] when he' send something to the
[18:38] Corinthians that's what was in the Bible
[18:40] when he send something to the Ephesians
[18:41] that was in the Bible so this was
[18:43] letters so there's nothing new about
[18:44] sending
[18:45] letters and send it to the seven
[18:47] churches which are in Ephesus smna
[18:49] pergamus thar Sardis Philadelphia and
[18:51] leosa and I turned to see the voice that
[18:53] spake with me of being turned I saw
[18:55] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[18:58] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[19:00] unto the son of
[19:01] man God has now imorph into his bride
[19:05] that's a big word for you but it's still
[19:07] he just moved over he changed his form
[19:09] because God is
[19:11] one God is one he is not two or three
[19:14] God is one he just moves over into
[19:17] another office just as I am a father and
[19:20] then I am also a son and I'm also a
[19:23] human being I'm one person but I can
[19:24] move over into the different offices I'm
[19:26] a husband different different titles but
[19:29] there's only one name which is my name
[19:31] and which is the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:33] Christ that we come under cuz he's our
[19:35] headship and that's why we baptize as
[19:38] the Bible tells us in the name of the
[19:40] Lord Jesus Christ and I exactly what
[19:43] Jesus said he said baptize in the name
[19:46] father's not a name son's not a name
[19:47] we've never been through this but I
[19:49] don't see how people are so blind I
[19:51] guess I do and G about the pouch with a
[19:54] golden girdle you may be seated just
[19:55] boed had y'all standing Lord so much you
[19:57] blame him
[20:00] if if Regina ARL be here she'd have been
[20:02] talking about you she said that's old
[20:04] people need to sit
[20:06] down yeah they'll stand up three hours
[20:09] to get in line to ride the Six Flag
[20:11] hello somebody Revelations 3:7 it's just
[20:13] what you want to do amen it's just what
[20:16] you want to do
[20:18] okay what about that group of people in
[20:21] the Bible they found a new piece of the
[20:23] Bible they found a new scroll and they
[20:25] stood for six hours stood for six hours
[20:29] outside to listen to what that piece of
[20:31] paper that they had found
[20:36] said well praise the Lord let's go about
[20:38] three tonight let's see how that'll
[20:40] work Revelations 3:7 says to the angel
[20:44] now here there's a message sent to an
[20:46] angel or a person one man God uses one
[20:50] man for every Church age and he sends
[20:53] that message to that man that man sends
[20:55] it to the people all right the people
[20:57] catch the revelation
[20:59] and then there are pastors and apostles
[21:01] and Prophets and teachers and different
[21:03] ones that catch the same vision and they
[21:05] go forth to the people all right so the
[21:08] angel of the church in Philadelphia
[21:10] write these things sayith he that is
[21:12] Holy he that is true he that hath the
[21:14] Key of David he that openeth and no man
[21:16] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[21:19] we'll try to get to that this after or
[21:20] this evening I Know Thy Works behold I
[21:24] have set before thee an open door and no
[21:26] man can shut it for thou has a little
[21:29] strength and has kept my word and has
[21:30] not denied my name see my name right
[21:34] amen man when the name of Jesus Christ
[21:37] is revealed to you that is a name you go
[21:40] all through the Bible and you look at
[21:41] that word says name name the whole
[21:43] family in heaven Earth has got a what a
[21:45] name and it's what Jesus Christ all
[21:47] right has a name you're identified by
[21:50] your name not your
[21:53] title many fathers in here raise your
[21:56] hand for your father we're all father
[21:57] we're fathers right now but there's only
[22:00] one Bob black so I said Bob black so
[22:02] everybody knows I'm talking about him
[22:04] many fathers I say father everybody goes
[22:08] what but if I say brother Bob black I'm
[22:10] speaking to you directly that's a name
[22:14] attached to it and that's why the whole
[22:16] family in heaven the Earth name Jesus
[22:18] Christ we are even M Jesus Christ that's
[22:20] why we don't take on some other name
[22:24] when we get married we lose our name and
[22:27] you become who you marri too and we know
[22:29] that spiritually to be Jesus Christ
[22:32] behold I will make of them the synagogue
[22:34] of Satan which say they are Jews and are
[22:36] not but do
[22:38] lie behold I will make them to come in
[22:40] worship before thy feet to know that I
[22:42] have loved thee because thou Hast kept
[22:44] the word of my patience I also will keep
[22:47] thee from the hour of Temptation which
[22:50] shall come upon all the world we'll get
[22:51] into that not next week end but not

[23:03] tempted to try them that dwell upon the
[23:06] Earth behold I come quickly hold that
[23:08] fast which thou Hast that no man take
[23:10] thy Crown to him that overcometh will I
[23:12] make a pillar in the temple of my God
[23:14] and he shall go no more out and I will
[23:16] write upon him the name of my

[23:25] congregation

[23:29] have moved out and somebody else moved
[23:30] in and I will write upon him the name of
[23:33] my God God's not a name it's an object
[23:35] of worship God's Got a Name is Jesus
[23:38] Christ which is New Jerusalem and the
[23:40] name of the city of my God which is New
[23:42] Jerusalem not the one over there now New
[23:44] Jerusalem which comes down out of Heaven
[23:46] from my God I will write upon him my new
[23:49] name he that ha an ear let him hear what
[23:52] the spirit saith to the churches so we
[23:54] have our chart and I want we're going
[23:56] to we're in that age where it
[23:59] says John Wesley the age started in 1750
[24:04] to
[24:05] 1906 John Wesley was the messenger and
[24:08] we'll read about him in a minute but you
[24:10] see Luther and
[24:11] Wesley they're very powerful men because
[24:14] what happened was is during that middle
[24:16] age number four see how dark it is
[24:19] that's a darkness of the of the of the
[24:21] depths of Satan but it's coming out of
[24:23] it to come out of it you need a strong
[24:25] men like Luther and Wesley but remember
[24:28] they are reformers not prophets so they
[24:31] can't so they can't take every Doctrine
[24:34] and make it
[24:35] correct they just don't have enough
[24:37] strength to do
[24:39] it but you and I have that strength to
[24:41] do it
[24:43] now we have we have the four combat
[24:46] Beast the lonox man and Eagle we'll get
[24:47] to that in just a second and remember
[24:50] when you talk about a um a church in the
[24:53] Bible a lot of times the Bible is
[24:55] brother Chris was preaching Sunday
[24:57] script has a dual
[24:59] meaning it can have a literal meaning
[25:02] and it can have a spiritual meaning all
[25:04] right so same way with this the
[25:06] dominating Church which was a dominating
[25:08] female if you'll read I'll promise you
[25:11] if you'll read The Book of
[25:12] Proverbs it was written by who Solomon
[25:15] with a thousand wives he knew something
[25:17] about
[25:18] women maybe not so much mother-in-laws
[25:21] but he did know about women and he told
[25:24] you a lot of things to be careful about
[25:25] a woman remember it's better to live
[25:27] with an Ox in your house and a brawling
[25:29] woman I'm just telling you what he
[25:32] said let's take that spiritually though
[25:35] cuz what happened was spiritually Satan
[25:38] got into the weaker vessel did that not
[25:40] happen in the Garden of Eden Satan
[25:42] didn't go to Adam and say hey Adam I got
[25:44] a new program for you he went to Eve and
[25:47] said Eve I got this new program for you
[25:50] and she took it same way with the church
[25:53] there's this new program and guess what
[25:55] Satan presented it to the church and
[25:57] they took it now church and bride is two
[26:00] different things everybody with me
[26:03] there's churches all over the place but
[26:04] there's only one bride of Jesus Christ
[26:06] and she is not a dominating female you
[26:09] and I are all female in the body of
[26:11] Christ see there's your dual meaning
[26:13] we're all feminist in the body of Christ
[26:15] we have a head which is Christ and we do
[26:18] what he says we don't dominate him see
[26:21] the world out there dominates him they
[26:24] don't tell me what to
[26:25] do come on somebody don't tell me what
[26:27] to do
[26:28] I know what I'm a
[26:34] cat no I feel like a
[26:38] dog they can't even be human
[26:41] anymore you think that's nor everybody
[26:43] thinks that's normal you know that's
[26:45] normal it's not normal it's
[26:48] perverted and it's Satan he made a man a
[26:52] man and a woman a
[26:54] woman man never had a baby ever
[26:59] so there's a difference in the two
[27:00] species or the two Sexes okay just for
[27:02] the new
[27:04] people so
[27:07] now there be a
[27:09] question now let me explain something
[27:12] I'm trying to slow down a little bit
[27:13] because of the ones here that's that's
[27:15] that's new and
[27:17] fresh God wrote Seven Seals in the Bible
[27:21] in the Book of Revelations Revelation 6
[27:23] and
[27:24] 8 what happened was that he there was
[27:27] something that he wanted to make private
[27:30] or secret until the end
[27:32] time all right so he sealed it up and
[27:35] put a stamp on it and you could there
[27:37] was something written but you couldn't
[27:39] see it even Paul said I look through a
[27:41] glass Darkly I'm looking through into
[27:43] something but I can't make out the words
[27:45] it's kind of fuzzy kind of like my new
[27:47] glasses if I take my new glasses off
[27:49] y'all
[27:50] fuzzy but I can still hear
[27:54] you see
[27:56] there so there was seals that was there
[27:59] was something in the Bible sealed up
[28:01] that man had never looked on before and
[28:04] then what happened in Revelation 6
[28:05] verse1 the lamb opens the seal shows it
[28:09] to John and shows John symbols everybody
[28:13] with me symbols horses
[28:16] ox man Eagles leopards all that it's a
[28:22] beautiful picture if you look at it and
[28:23] know by Revelation but it is hard to
[28:26] understand if not by revelation right
[28:28] all right Angels where are they what are
[28:31] their estate where did they fall from
[28:33] what are they there are no women Angels
[28:35] they're all men all those different
[28:37] things that we praise God that we had a
[28:39] prophet to tell us in the end time and
[28:41] then we looked in the Bible and said man
[28:43] that's exactly what he said amen so we
[28:46] thank God for that but there was some
[28:48] there was something sealed up well
[28:50] during these Church ages there was a
[28:52] there was a Ministry loosed in every
[28:54] Church age Paul was the first church age
[28:57] messenger that was a message loose from
[28:59] God Paul caught the mind of God and
[29:02] spoke what God
[29:04] Said all right so if we're Christians we
[29:07] should be very very very used to
[29:11] that if you're a Christian because we
[29:14] live by somebody catching the mind of
[29:16] God and speaking it by Revelation and
[29:19] then you catching it by Revelation all
[29:22] right but now remember God can't speak
[29:24] anything he hates false Doctrine
[29:28] so you won't get a false Doctrine out of
[29:30] God because if there because Satan can
[29:33] do the same thing Satan can get in this
[29:35] head
[29:36] too this is his playground greatest
[29:39] battle ever fought right here not out
[29:41] there right here he can get in and
[29:44] muddle it up and you can speak something
[29:46] that's wrong right that's right that's
[29:48] what happened in the in n and the
[29:50] different ones they they went to NAA as
[29:53] a one true and living Living God
[29:55] Doctrine as a water baptism in the name
[29:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ I proved it to
[29:58] you I read it to you in all the even in
[30:01] your history it shows you that the
[30:03] baptism was according to Lord Jesus
[30:05] Christ until they changed it at n Rome
[30:08] well who changed it did does God
[30:11] change does God make a mistake God's
[30:15] perfect he never made a mistake so he
[30:17] didn't go oops I'm sorry I didn't mean
[30:20] to say that uh he's not like
[30:22] us when he when he thinks it he speaks
[30:25] it it happens
[30:28] and I depend on that you should depend
[30:30] on that you should put your soul faith
[30:32] on that God never changes that God never
[30:35] makes a mistake every move he makes is
[30:38] calculated before the foundation of the
[30:40] world so it does not bother him when
[30:44] things happen he knows they're going to
[30:46] happen so there's a ministry that's
[30:49] loosed and it's loosed in stages God is
[30:52] a gracious God that he just doesn't as
[30:55] we even in high school and and or in
[30:58] grammar school we're sitting in grammar
[31:00] school and we were we're learning 1 plus
[31:01] 1 is two and and John and Mary and spot
[31:04] go to town I'm sorry some of you young
[31:07] kids don't know what that is but it was
[31:08] a reader book that we used to read out
[31:10] of and it was John and Mary and spot who
[31:13] was it Dick and Jane I said Dick and
[31:15] Jane Dick and Jane is
[31:18] spite thank you for the preachers on the
[31:20] first second
[31:21] row but but that's what we had when we
[31:26] were growing up
[31:28] but now we left that right we left that
[31:33] and got into something a little bit
[31:35] deeper right we didn't lose the
[31:37] foundation but we didn't we weren't we
[31:39] didn't go to high school in ninth grade
[31:41] and you got the same reader you got in
[31:43] kindergarten no it the the the
[31:46] curriculum changed why did it change to
[31:48] help you develop cuz we're going to get
[31:50] into that when we talk about
[31:52] justification and sanctification I found
[31:53] something a little bit ago that that's
[31:55] really going to help you if if we get to
[31:57] it
[31:58] but I saw when the lamb opened one of
[32:00] the seals so one of the seals had to be
[32:02] open so that we could see what was going
[32:03] on and there was four combat beasts
[32:05] according to the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel
[32:08] said that there was a lion ox man and
[32:11] Eagle everybody with me lonox man an
[32:15] eagle and those were anointings one Holy
[32:19] Ghost but those were anointings are
[32:21] powers to help us through life or to
[32:23] help someone through a dispensation a
[32:26] lion a roaring line in the first two or
[32:29] three Church ages to where they could
[32:31] speak boldly and got to back them up but
[32:34] now you come to the fourth age and we
[32:36] see the fourth age the second beast was
[32:38] an
[32:39] ox and he was very powerful but yet
[32:44] slow all right but that was needed in
[32:48] that age that it was sent to which was
[32:50] the fourth Church age and then there was
[32:52] a red horse went out or a power went out
[32:56] to actually literally kill kill people
[32:59] and if you look back in your history
[33:01] this is not something that is hidden but
[33:05] if you read Fox's book of Martyrs 68
[33:08] million Christians were killed by the
[33:10] Roman Catholic Church during the Dark
[33:13] Ages about 1500
[33:15] years they prove it they say they did
[33:19] but they say they killed them because
[33:21] they weren't their Christians and that's
[33:23] exactly what it was they were true
[33:26] Christians being killed by the Catholic
[33:27] Church
[33:28] literally killed them and then killed
[33:30] them more by their Doctrine cuz that
[33:33] Doctrine is still here
[33:35] today come on somebody that doctrine
[33:37] that Doctrine rode all the way up to
[33:39] this day right here where they still do
[33:41] the no venience and they still do the uh
[33:43] you know pay so much money and get you
[33:45] know get Uncle get Uncle Ray out of
[33:47] purgatory he's burning down there you
[33:49] got to give him some money if you ain't
[33:50] got enough money give a son we'll get
[33:52] him half the way
[33:53] out silly but it's what they go by
[33:57] there's no such thing as Purgatory show
[33:59] it show it to me in the Bible there
[34:01] nothing they worship Mary show me that
[34:05] in the Bible good grief Mary had to go
[34:07] to the upper room to get the Holy
[34:12] Ghost so the fifth and sixth age which
[34:15] is where we're at now trying to hurry my
[34:16] way back up to here so there was a third
[34:19] seal open and there was a third Beast
[34:22] stood up and said which was in in the it
[34:25] was in the uh form of a man which man is
[34:28] what intelligent all right a lion is is
[34:32] intelligent to a degree but it's a brute
[34:34] Beast all right an ox is in intelligent
[34:36] to a degree but it's a beast all right
[34:39] but man has come up now we've got some
[34:41] intelligence going on here and we've got
[34:43] some real intelligence where something
[34:45] can be developed but let me tell you
[34:47] something that person on that black
[34:49] horse he wasn't developing the truth he
[34:52] was developing error he was developing
[34:56] the false Vine he was developing the
[34:58] false
[34:59] Church Satan wants the church Satan
[35:01] wants to be in church he's in this one
[35:06] now if you're not born again you brought
[35:08] him with
[35:09] you
[35:10] sorry we'll get into that in a few
[35:13] minutes a Lo Black Horse and he said him
[35:15] had a pair of balances in his hand and I
[35:17] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[35:18] Beast saying measure of wheat for a
[35:20] penny and see thou measure Bary for a
[35:22] penny see thou you not hurt the oil and
[35:25] wine God spoke himself and he said
[35:28] listen the Holy Ghost is going to come
[35:30] out of this age and going to be strong
[35:32] in the next age
[35:34] coming oil and wine signifies the Holy
[35:37] Ghost right and the power the Holy Ghost
[35:39] and the power behind it now the black
[35:40] horse rider that was the Antichrist but
[35:43] one Speaking was represented by a man so
[35:45] now you got Luther and Wesley and during
[35:47] those two periods of time if you'll we
[35:51] don't have them up here but on those two
[35:52] periods of time man it was like
[35:55] accelerated growth accelerated um
[35:58] intelligence they went from horse and
[36:00] buggy and then they come up 1906 they
[36:02] had
[36:03] cars so they went from horse and buggy
[36:05] to some cars and then not a plane to an
[36:08] airplane and different ones all the way
[36:10] up well listen as man move God's already
[36:13] moved man don't move and then God
[36:16] reacts God already knows what you're
[36:18] going to do he's already there to react
[36:20] before you even get
[36:22] started so Martin Luther he sent a man
[36:24] named Martin Luther on the scene and
[36:26] Martin Luther is considered as the most
[36:28] influential figure in Western and
[36:30] Christian history why he he was listen
[36:33] he was just like Moses Moses went to the
[36:37] back side of the desert he was one man
[36:40] he actually was convicted of
[36:43] murder he killed an Egyptian he run away
[36:47] well 40 years later here he comes back a
[36:50] oneman Invasion
[36:51] army with a stick and a donkey a woman
[36:55] and two kids
[36:58] yes right that looked
[37:01] healthy but that's exactly what he did
[37:03] but that's exactly what Martin Luther
[37:05] did Martin Luther took the little bit of
[37:07] the word of God he had and he said I am
[37:10] going to go to the largest group of
[37:13] course he came out of that of course
[37:14] Moses came out of Egypt too right
[37:17] remember for 40 years Moses was tutored
[37:19] by Egyptians right all right so he that
[37:22] he had that mentality in his head
[37:25] already so he goes back loses all that
[37:28] meets God at the burning bush and the
[37:31] God tells him says go on down there
[37:32] Moses and take over make sure you take
[37:34] that stick with you and you're going to
[37:36] go down there and take over so so Martin
[37:38] Luther Martin Luther what he get he got
[37:41] the word of God the just shall live by
[37:44] faith not by no venage not by Penance
[37:47] not by going to a priest and and have
[37:48] him um
[37:50] um prepaid for your murders that's what
[37:54] they
[37:55] do pay them a little money and go to
[37:57] confessional booth and then you go out
[37:59] and do your business it's just all
[38:01] garbage but we know that but there's
[38:03] billions of people that are Catholics
[38:05] and there's some good people in there
[38:06] really are some really good people
[38:09] they're just they're just blind though
[38:10] because if you become part of that
[38:12] system you're part of you get caught in
[38:14] that system then that's your fault same
[38:17] way with us if we get caught in a
[38:19] different system it's our
[38:22] fault I'll read something to you in a
[38:24] minute about that but Martin Luther he
[38:27] come comes out and he takes and he says
[38:29] all right Catholicism everything you
[38:31] built on and I was a part of it so I
[38:33] know your system see God took a man out
[38:35] of the system so he can know what the
[38:37] system was he took Moses out of the
[38:40] system to give Moses a chance to look
[38:42] and it' be very familiar when he went
[38:43] back to Egypt same way with Martin
[38:46] Luther he comes out he goes back puts a
[38:48] thesis on the wall and he says come out
[38:51] of her my people the just shall live by
[38:55] faith not by anything else
[38:59] amen and he turned the world upside down
[39:02] he started a re Reformation or a
[39:05] protesting of one of the
[39:07] largest um denominations I guess or
[39:11] Christian supposedly Christian uh part
[39:13] of the era of the time he was in he went
[39:16] against
[39:19] them right he read this scripture right
[39:22] here I'm sure Galatians 3:11 but that no
[39:25] man is justified by the law in the sight
[39:28] of God it is evident for the just shall
[39:31] live by
[39:33] faith the just shall live by
[39:39] faith and they were reformers the
[39:42] prophet of God tells us that he was a
[39:43] mighty preacher teacher of the
[39:46] word assisted especially in his first
[39:48] years of public Eminence that the word
[39:50] was the sole criteria so he was against
[39:52] works as a means of Salvation and
[39:54] baptism as a means of regeneration he
[39:57] about the mediation of Christ apart from
[39:59] man was the original and Pentecostal
[40:02] concept so he caught the revelation of
[40:04] the word of God for his time and for his
[40:07] day and the just shall live by faith so
[40:10] that seed that was planted in the ground
[40:12] that went in the ground in that fourth
[40:13] Church age it was getting ready to bring
[40:15] life back up it was getting ready to put
[40:17] two shoots out it was beginning what to
[40:20] bring that plant back to where what man
[40:23] can see it you can't see a seed when
[40:26] it's laying in the ground it's covered
[40:28] it's hi but once it pops up you can see
[40:31] what it is and you see the
[40:32] characteristics coming up and that's
[40:34] what it was and God was pleased to dwell
[40:37] in that position he was pleased to dwell
[40:40] in Martin Luther just as he's pleased to
[40:42] dwell in me and you it's just that me
[40:44] and you have a different responsibility
[40:47] than Martin Luther we have Martin Luther
[40:49] plus everybody with me that's right so
[40:53] the doctrine of
[40:55] justification let's just cover it now so
[40:58] I won't have to miss
[41:03] it the word
[41:05] justification everybody with
[41:12] me everybody with me I'm up here I'm not
[41:16] down here or back under I'm right here
[41:17] look this way thank you pay attention in
[41:20] church you may learn something
[41:22] justification is the act by which God
[41:27] all right so that rules everybody else
[41:29] out that rules everybody else out all
[41:33] right Pope priest
[41:37] preacher
[41:40] Pastor the act by which God moves a
[41:45] willing person hold on a minute there's
[41:48] the
[41:49] key a willing
[41:53] person from the state of sin which is
[41:56] Injustice
[41:58] ice to the State of Grace which is
[42:02] Justice and justifies
[42:05] you everybody with
[42:08] me but now
[42:10] remember a pardon is not a paron until
[42:14] it's accepted as a
[42:16] pardon God didn't don't just justify you
[42:19] because he went to Calvary and you're
[42:20] just absolutely
[42:23] Justified the will of the person you're
[42:27] free will ask God to take your past sins
[42:32] and listen and not just cover them
[42:35] eradicate
[42:37] them everybody with
[42:39] me that's
[42:41] justification baby form where you
[42:43] realize you lost you realize you need
[42:46] somebody to erase your
[42:49] past and God will erase your past if
[42:52] you'll listen to him now listen that's
[42:55] erase it in here not here
[42:58] cuz this is the
[43:00] battlegr this is where God says you're
[43:03] Justified you say praise the Lord Satan
[43:06] says you did so and so you did so and so
[43:11] I was there when you did
[43:16] it I'm going be what somebody said the
[43:18] other day I want to be the one that
[43:19] kicks him into the
[43:22] hole I want to be the one that kicks him
[43:24] into the
[43:25] hole I hope he's screaming and kicking
[43:27] and got cancer and diabetes and all that
[43:29] other stuff hanging on
[43:32] him I'm sorry I wish he could get saved
[43:35] but he can't right he made his choice
[43:38] before the foundation of the
[43:40] world
[43:42] wow so there's no good justification is
[43:45] no good until accepted by that
[43:48] person so Martin Luther is saying look
[43:51] you've got to put all your trust in
[43:54] Jesus Christ put all your faith quit
[43:56] looking at at a church quit looking at
[43:58] this quit looking at that look to Jesus
[44:01] Christ and God counted that as righteous
[44:06] in that church
[44:08] age but now me and you it declares us
[44:11] righteous for the
[44:14] moment everybody with me it declares us
[44:17] righteous for the moment because the
[44:20] unclean Spirit has not left yet it's
[44:23] still there and it will still motivate
[44:25] you to do the same thing you did the day
[44:28] before you got
[44:29] saved that's
[44:34] right we're not trying to reform
[44:37] you we're trying to get you
[44:40] saved and let God change you there is no
[44:44] Reformation in Christianity you can have
[44:47] all these programs you want and that's
[44:48] fine we've got some friends that are
[44:50] that that do that 12-step program for
[44:52] alcoholics but they'll tell you up front
[44:54] you're an alcoholic don't go to the bar
[44:58] well I thought you trying to help these
[45:00] people I promise you you get under the
[45:02] power of the Holy Ghost one day and
[45:04] those things I used to do I don't do
[45:06] them no more I don't have to go there I
[45:08] don't want to go there the one that did
[45:10] make me go there ain't in there no
[45:16] more that's
[45:18] true cleaning out and putting the Holy
[45:21] Ghost
[45:22] in you can't teet her on the edge
[45:30] can't play with
[45:32] God we'll get to that back in just a
[45:34] second I I wanted to clear that up it's
[45:36] the act that God moves a willing person
[45:38] from sin Injustice to the State of Grace
[45:41] which is Justice all
[45:44] right so remember Luther was not able to
[45:47] lead the church back to the whole truth
[45:49] as would a man like Paul who was both
[45:51] Apostle and Prophet Martin Luther was
[45:53] not a prophet he did some things as a
[45:56] prophet he healed the sick all those
[45:58] different things he had miracles in his
[46:00] life but he wasn't a prophet of the
[46:04] word he wasn't a word Prophet right he
[46:07] had the word for his
[46:12] time I've not found your works perfect
[46:15] before God that's the reason there's a
[46:17] church it's a temple of God filled with
[46:19] God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit
[46:21] that was in Jesus while he was here on
[46:22] Earth causing him to do the mighty works
[46:24] that he did came back upon the church
[46:26] church at Pentecost so that they did the
[46:29] works that he did now this age did not
[46:32] have those works oh they had the written
[46:34] word but not the revealed word that was
[46:37] the Reformation period or that was what
[46:40] we call an unfulfilled
[46:43] time during Martin Luther because he
[46:46] didn't get all the way out he still took
[46:47] doctrines that were in the Catholic
[46:49] Church held on to them but then brought
[46:51] the new that just shall live by faith
[46:53] all
[46:55] right let's skip through this so the
[46:58] meaning of not perfect is what
[47:00] unfulfilled now I was thinking
[47:05] yesterday as we were studying back
[47:07] before you going to have to go back in
[47:09] your mind but remember when we come to
[47:11] the part to where Church in state
[47:15] married all right which was which was
[47:18] Constantine took religious Rome and
[47:22] civil Rome and put them together all
[47:25] right every by with me there was a
[47:30] marriage there was a marriage during
[47:32] that time of church and state which is
[47:35] what the depths of Satan but praise God
[47:40] brother Bob in the end time there's a
[47:43] marriage of Jesus Christ and his
[47:46] bride that's going to bring God back to
[47:48] the Earth not false
[47:51] Doctrine that's mine and your commission
[47:53] that's what we're here for we're here to
[47:56] get married
[47:57] we're here to get married with Jesus
[47:59] Christ though not get married with civil
[48:00] out there and the world out there we're
[48:03] supposed to get away from
[48:05] that everybody with me but praise God
[48:09] that's our that's our uh command to
[48:12] marry Christ and then do his bidding
[48:15] here not marry church and state back
[48:18] again no no no that was the bad that was
[48:21] That's what Satan wants to do and he's
[48:24] still doing it now he brought it right
[48:25] up to here but listen L God brought his
[48:27] bride right up too praise the Lord he's
[48:30] got a bride he'll have one in every
[48:32] Church age and even though deep dark
[48:34] whatever it is out there today there's
[48:36] still a church age there's still a bride
[48:39] that is sitting in that age but she's
[48:41] called out into Heavenly
[48:46] places only in
[48:49] Christ Revelations 18:4 says I heard
[48:52] another voice from Heaven saying come
[48:54] out of her her now what's her we go back
[48:57] to her and woman we go back to church
[48:59] come out of that church my
[49:03] people and be not partakers of her
[49:07] sins and that you receive not of her
[49:10] plagues amen God hates false Doctrine we
[49:15] should hate false Doctrine we should
[49:16] love the people but not partake of the
[49:19] doctrine that they
[49:22] have caution yourself when you listen to
[49:25] Doctrine
[49:27] check it by the Holy Ghost that's inside
[49:29] of you and if you don't have the Holy
[49:31] Ghost be careful you will get caught in
[49:33] that
[49:35] Doctrine but remember Satan can't cast
[49:37] out
[49:39] Satan Satan loves Satan so if he's
[49:42] inside of you you'll love that
[49:46] thing now look the Holy Spirit has been
[49:49] bound by denominations for 2,000 years
[49:52] now notice the seven sabbaths they
[49:54] couldn't get all the way out as we were
[49:56] explaining the other day back in the Old
[49:58] Testament you had seven years that you
[50:01] would work and then at the end of that
[50:03] seven years there was a release there
[50:05] was certain things went back to zero not
[50:08] everything right so you counted seven of
[50:12] those years 7 * 7 is 49 or 49 years at
[50:16] that 50th
[50:17] year everything that you bought sold in
[50:22] debt everything went back to
[50:24] zero right that's what we're looking for
[50:27] that's our Sabbath day it's not on a
[50:29] Sunday or a Saturday or a Wednesday or a
[50:31] Tuesday or whatever am we're looking for
[50:35] that day when we can be released where
[50:39] everything can be
[50:42] released will it release you of your
[50:44] problems no sorry it'll show you how to
[50:47] handle them
[50:49] though you won't get all that wowy wowy
[50:51] woo junk going on if something comes
[50:53] your way and it ain't right mortar blows
[50:56] up to me that's just Murphy's
[51:00] Law if you don't know Murphy just do
[51:02] something he'll show up at your house
[51:05] ask Dave Ramsey he'll tell you about
[51:06] Murphy's Law when you do something
[51:09] Murphy will show
[51:10] up so let's kick Murphy out well you
[51:14] listen what did Paul
[51:16] say when I do good Evil's
[51:20] present hello when I do good evil is
[51:24] present right amen and other words
[51:26] you're not immune from that we know
[51:29] where it's at though and we know his
[51:32] tactics we
[51:33] should and we know what to do with it
[51:36] when he starts to make a move right amen
[51:39] flee from the thing so the first three
[51:41] ages brought us the pure word of God the
[51:43] fourth Church age went into the ground
[51:46] the word went into the ground at
[51:48] nah it got eat down or eroded but God
[51:51] said I will restore Jesus said promised
[51:54] right here except a corn of wheat fall
[51:55] on the ground and die
[51:57] it will abide alone but if it dies it
[51:59] bringeth forth you and
[52:01] me you and me we're the
[52:05] fruit Jesus said I am the what Vine
[52:09] you're the branches where does the fruit
[52:12] grow on not the trunk it grows on the
[52:16] end of the
[52:17] vine right I mean the end of the
[52:20] branches but Vines if you want to talk
[52:22] about grapes so something had to die so
[52:25] that something could live in all of
[52:28] Christianity something has to die so
[52:31] that something can live right you have
[52:34] to die out to yourself so Christ can
[52:37] live inside of
[52:38] you not divorce not like I said reform
[52:43] or or
[52:45] suppress we're human beings try to
[52:47] suppress
[52:49] something all of a sudden one day it'll
[52:54] go oh I'm sorry I'm preaching to the
[52:56] wrong
[52:57] people pray for
[53:00] me when I do good evil is
[53:08] present but we deny that
[53:11] right Joel says I will restore to you we
[53:15] are in a time now of restoration now we
[53:17] know that Luther and Wesley were
[53:20] reformers but they began the restoration
[53:24] process to get us back to grain again
[53:27] that went in the ground now listen who
[53:29] was the seed that went in the ground
[53:31] Jesus Christ except a corn of wheat
[53:36] die and go on the ground and ab B
[53:39] alone amen but if it comes forth it'll
[53:42] bring forth what much
[53:46] fruit and I will restore to you the
[53:48] years that the Locust eat cankerworm
[53:50] caterpillar polymer or my great Army
[53:52] which I sent among you which is the same
[53:54] bug in different stages
[53:57] so moffit's definition was I will make
[54:00] up to you for the years or I will repay
[54:03] you for the
[54:06] years listen God doesn't owe us
[54:09] anything but to take you home to
[54:15] Glory he's repaid your
[54:19] time he repaid brother Dale's time yes
[54:22] sir he put him in a condition that the
[54:24] devil can't even get nowh don't even
[54:26] know where they brother John that place
[54:28] ain't even don't even the devil ain't
[54:29] even been
[54:31] in name many places on this Earth the
[54:34] devil ain't been in remember he told
[54:36] Jesus or God asked him said where you
[54:38] been he said oh I've been walking up
[54:40] down the Earth I've been walking through
[54:42] the Cs of fire I've been visiting your
[54:46] kids he said have you considered my
[54:48] servant
[54:49] job amen right but we're going to look
[54:53] and see now as we go into this
[54:55] Reformation we're going to and see that
[54:57] God give us a word now of progression to
[55:01] bring us from Shoot To Branch or shoot
[55:04] to stalk to tassel to full corn there's
[55:08] something going that's going to be a
[55:11] progressive revelation just as in
[55:13] Ezekiel
[55:15] 47:2 the water was to the ankles took
[55:18] them out a little further to the knees
[55:20] that's what we're trying to do that's
[55:21] why brother Chris and and brother Mike
[55:23] and all the different pastors around the
[55:25] country they're trying to get their
[55:27] people out in the deeper water I hope
[55:29] they
[55:31] are if not you're going to be shallow at
[55:33] the ankles but you're still going to be
[55:34] in the water can't deny
[55:38] it but if I want to go
[55:41] swimming I can't do it in ankle deep
[55:44] water you can't
[55:46] either but God gave us a revelation
[55:49] showing us that we can go to the ankle
[55:51] the knees the loins the head swim in the
[55:55] water so that's what he give us he
[55:57] started in that first church age to
[55:59] reform the Christians back into
[56:01] believing what Paul believed but they
[56:04] couldn't get everything because remember
[56:05] I am Alpha and Omega I'm going to bring
[56:10] back not in the second third fourth
[56:12] fifth or sixth age but the alpha bride
[56:15] is going to be the same as the Omega
[56:16] bride the Omega bride is going to be the
[56:17] same as the alpha bride the only
[56:20] difference is we're not plus they were
[56:22] plus because they were plus the next
[56:24] Church age that's right we have to come
[56:26] to a seventh seal end that's from a long
[56:30] way from now but we have to come in this
[56:32] age you have to realize we've come to an
[56:35] end a seventh seal end of all things
[56:38] where there's silence in heaven Satan
[56:40] don't know what to do with
[56:47] you now brother R tells us about the
[56:49] last three Church Ages which we're
[56:51] getting into of course we got one
[56:52] already done and getting ready to get in
[56:53] the other
[56:55] one now now that three elements that
[56:57] worked in those three Church ages now
[56:59] we're talking about Luther Wesley and
[57:02] Leota with a small little Pentecostal
[57:04] age in between that's what it takes to
[57:07] constitute the full birth so God God's
[57:10] brought the new birth in the old in in
[57:12] Paul's age now he's going to bring the
[57:14] real revelation of the new birth back in
[57:16] our
[57:18] age remember Luther's birth was he was
[57:23] justified by faith and he believed that
[57:25] he put his faith fath in that and the
[57:28] people that were with him put their
[57:29] faith in
[57:32] that that's what put them in the body of
[57:34] Christ they believed what their Prophet
[57:37] said or what their teacher he wasn't a
[57:38] prophet but they believed that that new
[57:43] doctrine Catholics never taught
[57:46] it right Paul did because he wrote it
[57:50] right but he got eroded down through
[57:53] time man had jumped in and put his idea
[57:56] in in to where now you got to pay for
[57:58] your justification you got to do the
[58:00] penants you got to you know do the hell
[58:02] marriage you got to do the rosaries and
[58:04] all that
[58:05] stuff no Martin Luther said no the just
[58:08] shall live by faith it says it right
[58:10] here in his Bible and it's
[58:12] free it's
[58:14] free you just believe what God's already
[58:16] said it's free so I'm telling you
[58:19] tonight if you don't know anything about
[58:21] God start with justification say God I'm
[58:24] done amen right I'm sick and tired of
[58:27] being sick and
[58:29] tired forgive me of my
[58:33] sins and he is what just to forgive you
[58:37] if you really ask
[58:41] him there's a difference in getting
[58:45] caught they were but now look they were
[58:47] only conceived as a little germ so it
[58:49] had to start in baby form a womb of a
[58:54] mother the Holy Spirit
[58:56] coming to birth now what about a birth
[58:58] of a a woman when you when you birth a
[59:00] child sisters water breaks then you got
[59:03] blood and
[59:04] life all right water
[59:08] breaks justification sanctification
[59:11] baptism the Holy Ghost listen when that
[59:13] water breaks you going to have that
[59:14] baby right normally normally now there's
[59:18] there's instances but when that water
[59:21] breaks you better get to the to the to
[59:23] the hospital or wherever you need to go
[59:25] cuz something's to happen there's
[59:27] something heading toward
[59:28] something all right that thing wants to
[59:31] get out and there's life waiting on them
[59:33] to get out come on somebody y'all go to
[59:36] sleep if you want to but Heavenly days
[59:38] the new birth ought to be the most
[59:39] exciting thing in your life Don't Clap
[59:42] cuz some of just
[59:44] asleep you'll wake them
[59:48] up it's a fervor you got to have a
[59:51] fervor did you not get that this weekend
[59:53] you got to have something that somebody
[59:55] else else don't have you might have to
[59:57] have something that your neighbor
[59:58] sitting there don't have but there's
[1:00:00] something got to be inside of you that
[1:00:02] says that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:00:03] but you got to be able to carry
[1:00:06] forward that's right well tomorrow's
[1:00:10] Thursday all that I got Wednesday like a
[1:00:15] balloon
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:22] Sunday
[1:00:24] Monday tie that thing
[1:00:27] off talk about babies tie that thing
[1:00:32] off but look if the Pentecostal message
[1:00:36] was the last message which justification
[1:00:38] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:39] Ghost the last three messages the last
[1:00:42] three Church ages forms the complete
[1:00:44] birth now listen that's what you and I
[1:00:46] had to have there had to be a baby born
[1:00:50] right not saying these were wrong but
[1:00:53] God said whatever was happening in the
[1:00:56] first age has got to happen in this last
[1:00:57] Church
[1:00:58] age the complete birth we got to know
[1:01:02] when we're Justified we got to know when
[1:01:04] we're Sanctified we got to know when the
[1:01:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost FS our fills
[1:01:08] our
[1:01:09] soul brother R said just like when a
[1:01:11] woman is having a baby first thing
[1:01:13] happens water next thing blood next
[1:01:15] thing life when they killed Jesus At The
[1:01:17] Cross what came out of his side water
[1:01:19] and blood and then the life came
[1:01:21] out praise God because that was me and
[1:01:24] you amen amen that's
[1:01:28] right now watch here's the here's the
[1:01:32] another Definition of
[1:01:34] justification it eradicates now watch it
[1:01:37] doesn't
[1:01:39] cover it doesn't cover it
[1:01:43] eradicates because listen God won't
[1:01:45] dwell in an unclean vessel if he doesn't
[1:01:47] forgive you of your past sins he can't
[1:01:49] start working on you amen so you can be
[1:01:53] so you can be sorry that you got caught
[1:01:55] and your sins will
[1:01:57] remain the Bible says a a repentant
[1:02:01] heart when you really truly say I've had
[1:02:05] enough God will forgive you of those
[1:02:07] sins and he will actually throw them in
[1:02:08] a sea of forgetfulness he won't ever
[1:02:11] remember them again now the devil might
[1:02:13] but he
[1:02:13] won't so look justification is it
[1:02:16] eradicates by faith in what Christ did
[1:02:19] at the cross so we had to have faith
[1:02:22] that Jesus was even alive we don't know
[1:02:24] that do you know he died do you know
[1:02:28] where he was
[1:02:29] buried oh somebody told
[1:02:32] you but that thing's got to come alive
[1:02:34] in
[1:02:35] you and I don't have to go over there
[1:02:37] and stand at the empty tomb I know
[1:02:39] there's an empty tomb cuz it's in
[1:02:41] here I ain't got to go look for like
[1:02:43] brother Chris or one brother Mike said
[1:02:45] I'm not looking for
[1:02:47] relics I don't need a Bell Buckle I
[1:02:50] don't need a fishing
[1:02:52] lure amen amen
[1:02:56] you see how Catholicism just runs right
[1:02:58] into
[1:03:00] everything trinkets all that stuff but
[1:03:03] anyway but it eradicates by faith in
[1:03:06] what Christ did at the cross the sins of
[1:03:09] your past nature now look it didn't
[1:03:12] destroy your
[1:03:13] nature right it eradicates the sin that
[1:03:16] was attached to that nature everybody
[1:03:19] with
[1:03:21] me all right
[1:03:27] but remember the guy that did it still
[1:03:29] there that's
[1:03:30] right the
[1:03:32] devil is still there there's no hold on
[1:03:36] your past it's
[1:03:39] gone God can't never bring you back up
[1:03:41] again but now day the next day the next
[1:03:44] day and the next day if you don't do
[1:03:47] something that thing's going to come
[1:03:48] right back up again and you're going to
[1:03:51] do the exact same thing you
[1:03:53] did 4 days ago 5 days ago six may take
[1:03:56] longer than
[1:03:58] that but listen so that that's why that
[1:04:01] we had to have a John
[1:04:04] Westley to come the next Church age and
[1:04:07] tell us about
[1:04:09] sanctification which is not eradicating
[1:04:11] your sin it's taking that thing
[1:04:13] completely out of
[1:04:15] you hold
[1:04:18] on what does Luke say Luke Luke 11:24
[1:04:22] says your unclean Spirit goes out why
[1:04:25] did he go
[1:04:27] out he was driven out
[1:04:32] right he loved it just like my cats at
[1:04:35] home they'll lay down right between our
[1:04:36] legs and they'll snuggle and you can't
[1:04:38] get them up for nothing just like you
[1:04:39] could throw them and they still be
[1:04:41] asleep Satan was comfortable inside of
[1:04:43] your soul he was comfortable with the
[1:04:46] things you did that's why you didn't
[1:04:48] come to church that's why you didn't
[1:04:50] come around your mom and daddy that's
[1:04:51] why you didn't want to talk about the
[1:04:53] Lord that was
[1:04:54] uncomfortable with the guy that was
[1:04:56] inside of
[1:04:58] you but praise God you go through
[1:05:01] justification hey I had to realize you
[1:05:03] had to realize if you're born again
[1:05:05] today you had to realize God eradicated
[1:05:08] your
[1:05:09] sin he eradicated your past because he
[1:05:12] can't hold anything against you if he
[1:05:14] don't know what it
[1:05:15] was and if he didn't get listen if he
[1:05:18] didn't get rid of
[1:05:20] everything he didn't come
[1:05:24] in God don't do halfway
[1:05:27] stuff you got to give him your
[1:05:35] all then the outer Court as we were
[1:05:37] talking about before the outer Court
[1:05:39] remember there was an outer Court inner
[1:05:40] court and the holy of holies the outer
[1:05:42] court if it rained you got wet there was
[1:05:44] no covering you could walk around there
[1:05:47] there's many people today brother R says
[1:05:49] that never went any further than the
[1:05:51] outer court now watch what he
[1:05:53] says this will trip you up
[1:05:57] that's never went any farther than the
[1:05:59] outer Court the veil yet they are
[1:06:02] Christians by the
[1:06:04] millions hold
[1:06:06] on they enjoy Christ in an
[1:06:09] outward form
[1:06:16] amen they go to church with a
[1:06:18] consolation of knowing they belong to a
[1:06:23] church Spoken Word Church would you like
[1:06:25] to realize what I just
[1:06:28] said they go to church with a
[1:06:30] consolation of knowing they belong to
[1:06:33] church but they have never become hid
[1:06:35] away with him in the inner court
[1:06:40] amen so there is a difference in being
[1:06:44] saved and being New Birth or being born
[1:06:49] again you can have
[1:06:51] salvation and not be born again believe
[1:06:54] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[1:06:56] be saved I guarantee you you confess
[1:06:58] your sins if you go outside and get
[1:07:00] killed in a car wreck you're going to
[1:07:01] heaven but you're not
[1:07:03] bride CU God's got to justify
[1:07:07] something come on God's got to justify
[1:07:10] something so he justifies you enough to
[1:07:12] get you into heaven but you're not going
[1:07:14] to be bride bride is somebody that's
[1:07:17] connected to it that has a part of him
[1:07:19] inside of it inside of them part of him
[1:07:22] inside of them and know what marriage is
[1:07:25] we connect with each
[1:07:28] other yet they are Christians they enjoy
[1:07:30] Christ in an outward form that's why you
[1:07:32] see people they disappear from church
[1:07:35] then they come back they disappear then
[1:07:37] they come back then they disappear God
[1:07:39] what cloudy days sunny days rainy days
[1:07:42] rainy days they don't show up when
[1:07:45] everything's going right or their
[1:07:46] favorite preacher shows
[1:07:48] up praise the
[1:07:51] Lord they'll just come by the flocks
[1:07:56] they're still in the outter court right
[1:07:58] they think they got something and it is
[1:07:59] it's an outward
[1:08:01] expression but I'll promise you you keep
[1:08:03] going and that old thing's going to pop
[1:08:06] up I promise you it will seen it before
[1:08:10] but they've never been hid away with him
[1:08:12] in the court cuz if you go to the next
[1:08:14] part you open the curtain and go into
[1:08:16] the next part only the priest can go in
[1:08:18] there now now all of them can't the
[1:08:20] priest can but the high priest goes on
[1:08:22] through but priest can go here because
[1:08:24] they have candlesticks that's artificial
[1:08:26] light they have some Mana there they
[1:08:28] have different things that's
[1:08:29] sanctification that's clean listen maybe
[1:08:32] there was 250 people in the outer
[1:08:36] court but now when you go to that middle
[1:08:38] court only the priest can go in so that
[1:08:41] does away with a group of people that am
[1:08:43] I making sense that does away with a
[1:08:46] group of people in their
[1:08:48] walk I just got
[1:08:50] that and their walk but now remember
[1:08:53] that group of people
[1:08:56] they don't get to go in the holy of
[1:08:57] holies only one the high priest walks
[1:09:00] right by them goes right into that holy
[1:09:03] of
[1:09:04] holies they have to stay out here
[1:09:06] they're clean enough to stay out in here
[1:09:09] right right but they're not clean enough
[1:09:11] to go in
[1:09:12] there that's why you have to be
[1:09:14] justified Sanctified and filled with the
[1:09:16] Holy Ghost
[1:09:20] amen listen let's worship him in the
[1:09:23] inner
[1:09:24] Court let's let's get this Shak kind of
[1:09:26] Glory back into our life yes sir let's
[1:09:29] get it where it's just you and God not
[1:09:30] you and God the
[1:09:31] preacher where's you and God and you

[1:10:25] sheep so I got to get in there with

[1:10:38] say look I was there that night for you
[1:10:40] I was coming right to your place and it
[1:10:42] was
[1:10:46] empty that's why I want to be it's why
[1:10:48] brother R said every time the door opens

[1:10:52] church your soul listen my not my soul

[1:11:06] of our schedule has been since Dad
[1:11:08] brought us up as little
[1:11:10] kids that's what I said we've been
[1:11:12] drugged all our
[1:11:14] life we were drugged to church when we
[1:11:17] didn't want to go but praise God I got
[1:11:20] part of that inoculation one
[1:11:23] day and they didn't have toight find me
[1:11:25] to come to church they found me in
[1:11:29] church where'd they find Jesus they
[1:11:31] found him in church amen if Jesus had to
[1:11:35] go to church sure should
[1:11:37] we amen well you don't know my problem
[1:11:40] well we can talk about it but let's go
[1:11:42] back to the Bible That's Right much more
[1:11:45] as the day approaches you should be in
[1:11:46] church cuz you're not going to make it
[1:11:49] by yourself you're not going to make it
[1:11:51] alone you will not make it you will fall
[1:11:54] you will not make
[1:11:57] it oh real quick let me cover this right
[1:12:01] here now look let's go back to
[1:12:02] Revelations 3:7 the Philadelphia and
[1:12:03] church age to the angel of the church in
[1:12:05] Philadelphia write these things sayth he
[1:12:07] that's holy he that's true he that ha
[1:12:09] the key of David I'm going to explain
[1:12:10] that just a second he openeth no man
[1:12:12] shutteth shutteth no man openeth I Know
[1:12:14] Thy Works behold I am set before thee an
[1:12:16] Open Door let's stop right there and
[1:12:18] I'll go to
[1:12:19] the to the comments and
[1:12:22] look the word Philadelphia means the
[1:12:24] love of
[1:12:26] Brethren I was talking to brother Andre
[1:12:28] a couple days ago and that's what the
[1:12:31] problem is now is the love of
[1:12:35] Brethren if somebody's against you or
[1:12:38] you're against
[1:12:39] somebody you don't even want to be
[1:12:40] around them well that's not the way
[1:12:43] brother R
[1:12:44] said that's not the way that right there
[1:12:46] supposed to be brotherly kindness is you
[1:12:48] love them
[1:12:50] more if they're against you right exctly
[1:12:55] Jesus told us he said pray for your
[1:12:57] enemies do good to those that
[1:12:59] despitefully use you know why cuz you
[1:13:02] Heap coals on his head you do something
[1:13:04] good to somebody and they're like I hate
[1:13:07] you why you doing this to me I said I
[1:13:11] don't care if you hate me or
[1:13:14] not I've got something to
[1:13:18] do no what we do is get toe to- Toe with
[1:13:21] them well which one are they going to
[1:13:23] see
[1:13:25] where are they going to see a
[1:13:27] difference if you're back and forth with
[1:13:31] them well praise the Lord anyway I Know
[1:13:33] Thy Works behind th set thee an Open
[1:13:35] Door no man can shut it thou has a
[1:13:38] little strength in other words they had
[1:13:39] a name they were coming out of that
[1:13:43] system and they were becoming Christians
[1:13:45] again not like they weren't before but
[1:13:47] they're becoming where Martin Luther
[1:13:49] separate John Wesley more separation
[1:13:53] John was giv us a way of of of sitting
[1:13:55] in church and having song Service First
[1:13:58] and having money tithe taken up and
[1:14:01] having missionary work and going in
[1:14:03] doing this that was that's why they were
[1:14:04] called Methodist it was a method of
[1:14:06] doing a
[1:14:08] service everybody with me so they had a
[1:14:11] little strength too but that it was an
[1:14:14] unfulfilled age in that time
[1:14:18] too now we know they all lapped over so
[1:14:20] we know that John Wesley he just built
[1:14:22] right he took he took Martin Luther's
[1:14:24] just ification and pulled it up and
[1:14:27] stacked sanctification on top of it he
[1:14:30] didn't do away with that justification
[1:14:32] he knew he knew he didn't say oh now we
[1:14:35] ain't got to listen to that guy over
[1:14:36] there he no he said man the just shall
[1:14:39] live by faith and we got to live a a
[1:14:43] clean life cuz the Holy Spirit was
[1:14:46] pulling that out of him in that church
[1:14:48] age amen and talking about a fervor he
[1:14:52] preached 800 sermons in one year amen
[1:14:58] we get about 50 if we're
[1:15:04] good the sardian church AE started the
[1:15:07] Reformation that must still go on to the
[1:15:10] grain that was planted at Pentecost goes
[1:15:12] through the full cycle of planting
[1:15:13] watering nourishing till it comes right
[1:15:15] to the Original Seed we have now come to
[1:15:17] that point of
[1:15:19] time we are at the Original Seed time
[1:15:22] that're going to God said no don't
[1:15:24] Harvest them now let them all grow up
[1:15:26] I'll separate the wheat and the tears so
[1:15:29] let God do the
[1:15:31] separating all
[1:15:36] right that's where church was married to
[1:15:38] the state but I believe now we're
[1:15:40] married to Christ in this last Church
[1:15:43] age
[1:15:46] fully John Wesley was the church age
[1:15:49] messenger born in 1703 died in
[1:15:52] 1791 it was John Wesley remember all he
[1:15:54] was the he was one of 19
[1:15:58] children your sisters worry about three
[1:16:00] or
[1:16:03] four sister Wesley taught every one of
[1:16:06] them at home did their did their mama
[1:16:10] did their
[1:16:12] drawers hung them up on the line and
[1:16:14] still taught them how
[1:16:16] to talk and
[1:16:20] read if you'll remember brother Rand
[1:16:22] makes a point here and I won't go too
[1:16:24] far but I'll finish in just maybe this
[1:16:26] weekend he was born to Samuel and
[1:16:28] Susanna Wesley Samuel Wesley was not
[1:16:31] very well thought of he was a stickler
[1:16:35] for a method so nobody liked him they
[1:16:39] wouldn't let him preach they kicked him
[1:16:41] out of a certain place he come back
[1:16:42] again they kick him out again but what
[1:16:45] Happened One Night is
[1:16:47] all of the kids were gone except
[1:16:51] John and the house caught on fire he was
[1:16:54] on the Second
[1:16:56] Story they run in to see if they can
[1:16:58] find him or couldn't find him of course
[1:16:59] everything's made out of wood back then
[1:17:01] so the wood the wood was falling in and
[1:17:04] somebody happened to look up through the
[1:17:05] smoke and what John was doing he was
[1:17:07] trying to push a piece of furniture into
[1:17:10] the window to break it well finally they
[1:17:12] found him they saw him up there and one
[1:17:15] guy run around the back and come up the
[1:17:17] backside and and they got down to the
[1:17:19] bottom to catch him but they threw him
[1:17:20] out and the man come out because
[1:17:22] remember brother random says that John
[1:17:24] West
[1:17:25] was a fire
[1:17:27] brand snatched from the fire he
[1:17:30] literally was but he was a fire brand
[1:17:33] preacher that put a fire in him maybe we
[1:17:36] ought to be caught in an upper room with
[1:17:37] a come on somebody with a fire going off
[1:17:41] and you can't get out of there by
[1:17:42] yourself and let God show up and help
[1:17:44] you out I promise you you'll be a fire
[1:17:46] brand you'll think a lot different
[1:17:48] you'll talk different you light
[1:17:50] different when the fire god hits you
[1:17:52] I'll promise you that but that's his his
[1:17:54] father father said John you're a fire
[1:17:56] brand snatched out of the fire and that
[1:18:00] lit a fire in him I guess to preach 800
[1:18:02] sermons and over 4,000 in his
[1:18:06] lifetime he bus the stick he did all
[1:18:08] these different things but they were
[1:18:10] called Methodist and other
[1:18:14] titles actually went to Georgia for a
[1:18:16] little
[1:18:17] while total disaster
[1:18:19] though cuz you know what John Wesley did
[1:18:22] he went over there thinking that he was
[1:18:24] born
[1:18:26] again
[1:18:28] right he he went all the way to Georgia
[1:18:31] to convert the Indians them heathens to
[1:18:35] convert them into
[1:18:37] Christianity he meets the moravians he's
[1:18:40] so impressed with them they're so Meek
[1:18:42] and I mean there's a storm coming up and
[1:18:44] the boat's falling apart and they're
[1:18:46] just down there singing and and John's
[1:18:48] probably puking and and um you know not
[1:18:50] having a very good time but when he
[1:18:53] comes back to England that's what he
[1:18:54] said he said I went to America America
[1:18:57] to convert the Indians but oh who shall
[1:18:59] convert
[1:19:00] me he knew he didn't have what those
[1:19:03] people
[1:19:04] had I knew I didn't have what the bride
[1:19:07] had right amen you need to realize that
[1:19:11] find you some bride get around them
[1:19:13] that's why I said you need to be in
[1:19:17] church but back in London he met him
[1:19:19] again and we keep going again Charles
[1:19:22] actually said John come on buddy come on
[1:19:25] brother you were born again way over
[1:19:27] here and John said uhuh no sir he could
[1:19:32] un understand how such a spiritual man
[1:19:34] as John should say that he was not
[1:19:36] formerly right with God it was however
[1:19:38] not long that Charles got a
[1:19:41] fire he was saved by grace the work soon
[1:19:45] took on such proportion that he began
[1:19:47] sending out numerous laymen now look it
[1:19:49] was an Open
[1:19:50] Door travel was a lot better you could
[1:19:53] go by boats and different things travel
[1:19:55] was better so what he would do is he'
[1:19:57] get numerous people now doesn't that
[1:19:59] sound familiar Paul did the same
[1:20:02] thing Paul would go to an area he'd get
[1:20:05] them all built up he'd get some good
[1:20:07] preachers in the area and then he'd
[1:20:09] leave and let them do the work so the
[1:20:12] same way what was John Wesley doing the
[1:20:13] same thing he was getting Layman to
[1:20:15] preach the word this seemed like a
[1:20:17] parallel to Pentecost where the spirit
[1:20:19] raised up men with power to preach and
[1:20:22] teach the word almost overnight
[1:20:26] of course there was a violent opposition
[1:20:27] to it remember I told you that time they
[1:20:29] kicked John out cuz they kicked his
[1:20:31] daddy out and they kicked John out so
[1:20:32] John John's Daddy was buried in a
[1:20:34] courtyard somewhere and and on a mum up
[1:20:38] this high so John runs over there and
[1:20:40] jumps up on top of it and starts
[1:20:42] preaching and the people from the church
[1:20:43] comes out and said you got to leave he
[1:20:45] said no my daddy bought this property
[1:20:47] and now I own it you can't take me off
[1:20:50] of
[1:20:52] this do we have that fervor would we
[1:20:55] would have done you know while you while
[1:21:00] you watch this right here he could not
[1:21:04] remember to have felt lowness of spirit
[1:21:07] for even a quarter
[1:21:10] hour since he was
[1:21:13] born none of y'all done
[1:21:17] that he slept no more than 6 hours a
[1:21:21] day arose in time to start preaching at
[1:21:24] 5: practically every day of his
[1:21:26] ministry preached up to four times in a
[1:21:29] single day so a year he would average
[1:21:31] 800 sermons he traveled multiple
[1:21:34] thousands of miles on a
[1:21:37] horse as did his circuit Riders who
[1:21:39] carried the gospel near and far Wesley
[1:21:42] traveled 45 100 miles per year by
[1:21:47] horse he must have had a good
[1:21:50] warranty he was a believer in the power
[1:21:53] of God and he prayed for the sick with
[1:21:54] great faith and wonderful results let's
[1:21:58] skip through this just for a minute I
[1:21:59] want to get something to you this is
[1:22:00] what John said now this is where John
[1:22:03] direct
[1:22:06] what he could have been wealthy but he
[1:22:08] didn't his favorite saying was get all
[1:22:10] you can save all you can and give all
[1:22:13] you
[1:22:14] can how strange it would be for Wesley
[1:22:16] to come back and see the denomination
[1:22:18] that bears the name of Methodist boy
[1:22:20] wouldn't
[1:22:21] he having gay pride weak in them in the
[1:22:24] church
[1:22:25] Church gay pride month in the church saw
[1:22:28] it on YouTube guy standing there with
[1:22:30] the color flag all behind him and
[1:22:33] he but look folks that's not
[1:22:36] deceiving we know that's garbage but
[1:22:39] what about the deception that eats at us
[1:22:41] the little foxes that spoil the
[1:22:45] vine they are vastly rich but the life
[1:22:47] and power of John Wesley is missing he
[1:22:51] didn't desire to build a work upon a
[1:22:52] denomination or sectarian base he was
[1:22:55] Armenian in his beliefs he did not want
[1:22:56] to separate from the Brethren on the
[1:22:58] grounds of Doctrine he was a good
[1:22:59] candidate for James he based his eternal
[1:23:01] life on faith and words are the living
[1:23:04] of the life rather than simply accepting
[1:23:05] a Creed or doctrine statement so now
[1:23:09] what's the difference then in
[1:23:12] what Martin Luther
[1:23:15] preached and what John Wesley
[1:23:19] preached listen to me a
[1:23:22] minute what John Wesley what uh Martin
[1:23:25] Luther
[1:23:26] preached just shall live by
[1:23:28] faith that's
[1:23:32] it that's
[1:23:34] it
[1:23:36] right come over here to sanctification
[1:23:40] though and watch what John Wesley
[1:23:43] preached he based his eternal life on
[1:23:46] faith and
[1:23:48] works Martin Luther based his on faith
[1:23:52] alone remember he inter intered the
[1:23:54] Bible he interpreted his German Bible
[1:23:57] says by faith
[1:24:00] alone but you take that and he stood on
[1:24:03] it and it was part of God but now you
[1:24:06] come over to John Wesley he based his
[1:24:08] interal eternal life on that faith and
[1:24:11] then working through it so what is
[1:24:15] sanctification justification does what
[1:24:18] declares you're righteous for that
[1:24:20] moment declares you're
[1:24:22] righteous praise God
[1:24:25] grab a hold of that if that's where
[1:24:26] you're at but there's
[1:24:28] more cuz you got to come over here to
[1:24:30] where the unclean Spirit goes out you
[1:24:32] got to come over here to where you start
[1:24:33] living more Godly that the devil hates
[1:24:35] to be around
[1:24:36] youen so sanctification is what it's a
[1:24:40] gradual growing
[1:24:44] righteousness think about
[1:24:46] it cuz remember I'll promise you one
[1:24:49] thing in sanctification there's some of
[1:24:51] them Devils that run pretty quick and
[1:24:53] they some of them that claw the
[1:24:55] walls getting out of your
[1:24:58] soul well praise the Lord I'm preaching
[1:25:00] to
[1:25:01] me there's some of them that it was easy
[1:25:03] for you to get rid
[1:25:05] of there was some of you it was
[1:25:08] hard cigarettes don't you don't mind a
[1:25:13] while wasn't it Bubba yes sir but it
[1:25:15] gone but that devil was
[1:25:19] going chop
[1:25:22] board and when he he finally gave it up
[1:25:25] that demon was
[1:25:27] gone we believe in demons here just as
[1:25:29] much as we believe in Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] because they're
[1:25:33] real and they do influence
[1:25:36] you but Luke 11 says the unclean Spirit
[1:25:38] goes out of the
[1:25:40] man so sanctification is our gradual
[1:25:43] growing righteousness in that part all
[1:25:47] right made possible by the spirit of God
[1:25:50] that's why we got to get under the
[1:25:52] influence of God not under the influence
[1:25:54] of a Creed are not under the influence
[1:25:56] where Satan can hide behind
[1:25:59] it well I've quit smoking if I got to
[1:26:02] quit drinking
[1:26:06] too or in your case I quit drinking I
[1:26:09] got to quit smoking come on just a
[1:26:11] little bit
[1:26:12] more no God knew one thing for
[1:26:15] sure I never did smoke but I chewed
[1:26:17] tobacco
[1:26:18] for since I was 14 I
[1:26:21] guess and uh
[1:26:24] he knew that would be rough so the day I
[1:26:27] get my heart to
[1:26:29] God the last day that thing any of that
[1:26:32] ever the desire was absolutely gone now
[1:26:35] remember there was other of them Devils
[1:26:37] going but that one was gone just like
[1:26:41] that the day I came right up here in
[1:26:43] December gave my heart to the Lord and
[1:26:45] said I'll serve you Lord just give me
[1:26:47] some
[1:26:47] time I walked back out that door I had
[1:26:50] skull everywhere I had I had my red man
[1:26:53] and I had all this stuff and I had to
[1:26:56] and more the devil you know he lets you
[1:26:57] find it every once in a while you know
[1:26:59] after about 3 weeks you you find one
[1:27:01] that you didn't throw out like
[1:27:03] the you find one you didn't throw out
[1:27:07] and you're
[1:27:12] like the unclean Spirit goes out so now
[1:27:15] we're in sanctification we'll get to the
[1:27:16] baptism of the holy ghost in a little
[1:27:18] bit but a Sanctified life is made
[1:27:21] possible by the spirit that dwell that
[1:27:23] will not dwell in you but it's getting
[1:27:25] ready to cuz remember sanctification is
[1:27:27] what
[1:27:29] cleaned and set
[1:27:31] aside for some kind of service clean and
[1:27:35] set aside for some kind of service I
[1:27:37] think I got it down right here we'll
[1:27:38] skip we'll get back to this this weekend
[1:27:41] let's stand musicians
[1:27:47] come guess I spent too much time
[1:27:49] backgrounding I'm sorry
[1:27:55] cleaned up and set aside for use or a
[1:27:59] purpose cleaned and set aside for
[1:28:03] because remember in justification you're
[1:28:04] not
[1:28:06] clean

[1:28:11] sins that was on your piece of
[1:28:14] paper that the recording Angel was
[1:28:16] recording since you come to the age of
[1:28:18] accountability it it

[1:28:27] made you do it it is going to be with
[1:28:29] you and it's going to start accumulating
[1:28:32] again everybody with
[1:28:35] me but what happens when you get born
