commit it to you now in Jesus name amen be Ephesians 1 we'll begin to read about verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places in Christ according he as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that's right that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will through the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he ha purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we've have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word we like got a lot of quotes a lot of things to bring out and we're going to be talking for it'll be quite a while I'm sure but we're going to uh make a topic out of it and go into kind of a series of things and it'll be on predestination predestination brother B said it's a hard word or a bad word to use on times in untrained congregations but after all of the years of being here and the things that we preached on these things it shouldn't be any problem with uh you know the word predestination with us but now forgive me but now for those that will be listening and all and what we will do and make sure here too that we uh wind up you know getting uh as much understanding as we can and put out as much information as we can on the subject of what the prophet has said and then that way um some hearing maybe that hasn't never heard a thought or a point on predestination you know how I am anyway I just always start at the bottom of something and just build a slow basis of gradually uh coming upward until I I can get to a place to say what I want to now this afternoon we're going to do something very different odd that we've never done before I don't think maybe we have played it one time over the 35 years that I've been Pastor uh maybe we've played one tape I'm not certain uh but anyhow we're going to play the tape on communion this afternoon and we want you to listen to it and follow along and brother Joe and Richard and him got up here last night and rigged up system to where that you'll be able to actually read it as brother brandom is preaching on it so we we want to do that now it's not just about but I want you to get the point now in the thoughts in your mind of what he would be saying about communion who qualifies uh what would disqualify you um the things but I want you to go on and maybe keep this message in mind and if you do like I do sometimes uh repetitive things is easier to remember now we found out last night a lot about people here that you got to keep telling them over and over because they kept losing last night in a little game we were playing which you know the right or the left and uh we wound up seeing that a lot of people doesn't know which is their right hand and their left hand and you know it gets all confusing sometimes but it was a lot of good fun and everything of doing it uh but it is good to be repetive itive uh you know keep repeating something until you get it brother R said hold up a point till the people get it then move on know it doesn't bother me to to preach long lengthy uh serieses uh I don't intend to but I want to cover everything to the detail to where that it won't be somebody will come along and say well you left this out you know what about this well if we can cover it we will try our best to cover it all right now to me whether it be thank you brother whether it be predestination whether it be um well as a matter of fact anything anything whatsoever uh you know that you would be thinking on uh to me the basis of all the Bible and understanding is based upon one thing first that God God is real he is not just the thoughts of your mind we've been through that through the series as we just finished talking about it and this may surprise you where we will will be going with this series so I would uh pay attention and if you miss any of them you know I know sometimes you have to miss services but we have it a wonderful situation to where that you can uh go in and pull them down on your computer and if not you can get the services downstairs off of the the CDs MP3s Etc cuz we don't want you to lose you think well I'll just catch up I myy for services brother brother Dale just keeps reviewing so much well I keep reviewing to where that will'll get it but you might miss something in that service and not do so I ask you to please listen and it may uh take away a lot of questions before uh the questions come up okay all but but I believe that the basis of of the Bible and all things is to believe First that God is real right amen he is not just a thought of your mind he's not a good thought and the devil's a bad thought you know this doing and that doing it's not that way it's whether or not God is real all right and see believing whether or not he's real will tie into to the point that we'll be dealing with does God know all things yes now does God know all things now see I I try to cover everything where there won't be a loophole cuz see in the series I just finished we were talking about that uh um you know sometimes God forgets because what's under the blood he can't remember but remember he put it under there it's not that he don't know you know he's the one that that uh devides the way to be able to get to where he doesn't remember all right so don't go that way and don't say well we got you now you you now you no no we just cover everything that way you have no problem see you know we keep it all in a straight line I believe that God knows everything amen you've heard the prophet many times say he knows every nap that would ever be in the world yeah and he said how many times that natat would bat its eye that's right and how much Toler I didn't know Nat's made Tyler but that's what he said and how much Tyler that that they make you know and uh you know so then being infinite see then he knows all things so don't think you're going to pull anything over on him right amen like I told you about my daddy with predestination my mother was talking to him one day about it and and she said well you know uh God knows everything and he predestinate he said well uh you know like that to him he he said does he God know I want to pick that bowl of cotton she said well yes he does he said well good I'll go around it won't pick it well see that's our foolishness we'll get to in a minute on our thoughts of predestination where brother R calls it foolishness you know our thoughts about something like that you know in the line of the truth becomes foolishness you know to God because as I said even though he would forgive our sins it's not that he would not know about that because if he didn't know about that to start with then you wouldn't have any sin right see because that's why the law came into existence not for the sole purpose but because it was the word of God but it bring comes into existence to bring a knowledge of sin right to where that you know a record was made under the law well you know if it's that way under the law it's not any different under grace we we don't just play around and say well bless God I'm a Christian so it don't matter what I do hey that way you prove you're not a Christian I mean that solves a problem you know brother Dale's tough and mean I know when he says things but why not say it like that I mean if I live like the devil I am the devil and if I say that something like that then I'm I'm lost all right we'll get out of those thoughts in a minute but now what do you think about it do you believe God knows everything yes that's right what kind of a god do you have you know is he like us that it's peanut brain that you know doesn't know what about it what do you think about him does he know everything I say if he doesn't know everything then why worry about it that's right right right just go live like you want to if that's what you believe because God don't know it y well he's up in heaven up in there you know the work as we covered in the last series he even sent down investigating angels to make sure that everything that he knew was right and would be able to have a witness you know in the Bible you got to have two witnesses two or three so you got to have two so God knows what people will do and then he sends down investigating things right and then he'll use me and you against each other that's right right why because I see you do it you see me do it so we wind up being a witness against each other but see does he know all things that's the basis of everything we talk about predestination there's garbage K's teaching in the denominations about it and also in this message of predestination but how does God that's the point I want to ask you the question today and we just put a subtitle how does he know it how does God know it does he have to wait until we do something and you're missing it see then he would be in trouble because you would have Jacob and Esau right CU Jacob and Esau shows you the perfect example before Esau ever done it God knew right so you see we're going to go back before the foundation of the world as we get to it and we're going to go back there in a way by way of the Prophet messenger that will be able I believe to help us understand all of these doctrines that are in the message and thanks to see that uh some of it doesn't line up too good but now what is your thoughts about predestination what do what do you think about it okay but the main point now as I said keep it on I'm bring it I'll probably bring this in every service to begin with is to believe that God knows all things and he knew it before we'd ever do it right or else he's not God right see he's not God now what he chooses to not remember will be his choice that's right but we'll get to it where the scripture says the thing form can't say why did you form me this away am we get down into a lot of it and just be real slow and it doesn't matter I wanted to preach a couple of messages before having reason I postpone to communion until this week because I was thinking I'd be able to get through uh Sunday morning in the last week and and I could preach Sunday evening on what I wanted to say and then bring out a little something before we would listen to what brother randam would say on the communion message about predestination but we're not going to be able to do it so I saw it and so I just said well okay Wade You Preach Wednesday cuz I'll just take it real slow okay all right let's go now with the thought in mind that God knows all things now I love the way brother brandom makes everything because he L leaves no loophole that's right because remember now brother brandom is having to preach to people around the world and he's preaching to theologians you know that are sitting there waiting just you know for him to make some little verb out of place y right some little something you know that they can attack and and then they can you know come up and say well here's this here's that now he was human he made mistakes now I appreciate the theologians for being that way I'm talking about all over the land because they did understand that he'd make mistakes and they couldn't use his mistakes cuz that'd be very easy for him and other people to say well that was a mistake I made you ought have been smart enough to realize that cuz you make them too and that's you know that's the way smart people are you you you got to talk to them on the Smart Level because they'll they'll try to trap you into anything now that people ain't going to believe it anyway right we get down to it where the Prophet said if you're not predestinated to see predestination you w never see it that's righten that's right you'll never see it that's right you'll have your own idea concept and thought it don't matter what said y or what's read you know talking to a man on the phone one day and he said well so I said well brother said so and so he I don't know whether he said it or not I said you give me a minute to go get my computer running and let me get it cuz I can't you know I can give it to you in a hurry off a bit no see he knew better he knew if I was going to say it that I could back it up right but see then he didn't believe it anyway it didn't change anything in other words he was telling me I don't care if you read it that's right it ain't going to change me oh we believe everything brother random says until it comes down to something we don't want to believe that's right you know oh yes the message is perfectly all right except one thing well see then people by doing that you don't realize that you're making yourself greater than the prophet was cuz if you can straighten out a prophet we're supposed to worship you cuz the only step up from the prophet is God right all right he's so close Dar you got to be careful on that but then the next step up would be almighty God Amen so if you can straighten the right and straighten out brother brandom then that would make us God get your shoes off a kiss you toe that's not nice I don't mean it is a joke I mean it's God's honest truth I'm serious about it my life is at stake on these things but look what he says spiritual inspiration 19561 128 get all this down to where we'll know he's talking about God God knows all things and making predestination for it God knows all things he's an omnipotent he's omnipresent he's om ient he knows all things when the world before there was a star in the heavens before there ever was a light in the firmament God knew every Prophet that ever lived or everything that men and women would ever do he's infinite see all right he wants us to get ready now look what he says and who is this mzc 1965 because when brother random starts making statements as I said people are waiting for him to make a statement and then they can show how really smart they are to correct him all now the next statement is is he's a being and he's not just all over the world like we think oh brother Rand I got you because you said he was omnipresent all right we let him Express see because how could one being be omnipresent right okay so we let him say it who is this meled 1965 220 uh there they are get the glasses 1965 221 the evening all right right down to the middle paragraph God has to be infinite we're finite he's infinite and he was omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God knows all things all places because of his omnipresence right now in the second we'll read these being so now you got a problem with omnipresence to believe in a being so we'll let him answer it he says omniscience makes him omnipresent right how is God omnipresent in the fact that he's omniscient right he knows where he needs to be that's right his omniscience makes him omnipresent he's not on the moon today if there's nobody on the moon right he doesn't need to be there but when someone goes there he's can go there with him you know all right do you understand the OM omniscience knowing all things then that way him being a being he doesn't have to be like the wind that just floats around that we think see now he's a being cuz let's read it amen omniscience makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he's a being he dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything that's going on there can't be a flee B is eye but what he noted and he knowed it before there was a world and how many time it B its eye and how much Tor it had in it but before there ever was a world that's infinite we can't comprehend it with our mind but that's God God infinite right all right so now he's omniscient knowing all things so if he needs to be anywhere he can be there that would make him omnipresent see now but yet he's a being he's a person see all right now in doing that now that's the basis of what we're talking about predestination predestination according to Webster is the act of predestined predestined all right is to like a doctorine of things you know see for your point it's to to Destin in advance right right for ordaining are predetermined that's predestined all right now brother brandom used that one time is all I can find that he used the word predestine and then one time he used the word predestines plural so we'll read it in other words a message called Jesus arose 1956 405 paragraph in other words E5 in in St it's strange in Reading taking his word how that God way back before the world ever begun and I begin to see the thing unfold and know that God didn't make a choice then right and listen to these things now Mark them I underline all those but you mark out I I would suggest because if you'll notice a lot of times what I do I have a little highlighter and if you saw my notes uh it looks like the flag more already uh you know I use many different colors that means this one is more or less a purplish looking that means that that's a quote uh this one is yellow that means emphasize a little on that you know the blue means make sure you explain that okay so if I was you I'd bring me a thing along sometimes and I would sit down and when I'm reading these things or take your pencil and you know while you reading put little quotations around it to where you can remember that right all right so watch what he's saying now God did didn't make a choice then God could could not say the word of predestinate the word predestinate as I always said is not a good word to use to the public right because predestinate means perhaps to to to predestine something to happen but God could predestinate by four he knew what would be not willing that any should perish okay but that all would come to repentance but being infinite in God he could predestinate and foretell by forn knowledge right okay now lot covered in that little paragraph right amen right all right so brother Bram uses the word predestine right and tells you what predestined means it means something to happen okay now we read in there that God doesn't choose like we think right but then how does he predestinate okay not willing that any should perish that's scripture amen so it could predestinate by for knowledge oh brother Dale he's still about for knowledge we're so far up here until we sailed out into the great vast ways of the message and we're out into the infinite place and y'all are still talking about four nights now you tell me how you can get to where you're at I mean I know that they take an airplane they I know they make a a rocket and they can just go and they can sell out there and they can land on the moon I know that but you know how they got started because they call it the same horsepower but means the force of thrust is what you're using but they still say that they take so much horsepower to push that rocket to outer space and to bring it back and you know that started from a horse you know the power of a horse the thrust of a horse the ability to pull a a wagon or a buggy you know and and and to make it work and make it go the cars are called horsepower because that means the thrust point of what you're doing now I'm not a mechanic I'm I'm just using my own terms okay you put yours there but it just simply means a Thrust or a force or a push of doing that's why I told you the whole time you don't believe it but a horse pushes a wagon it don't pull it I tried my best to explain that to you from the beginning I'm an old Farmer Boy he pushes the collar the collar pushes the gears the gears by chains pulls the wagon okay so it's thrust thrust Force push all right now so God then he does it in a way that it can never be brought up against him that is wrong right okay amen so he say he says we'll get to it in a little while he says how can the thing formed say why did you form me thus amen right he's very specific in saying it he said I make vessels of honor and I make vessels of Dishonor right we get down to some of these where brother Brandon said uh like what is it over in Jude it says brute Beast made to be destroyed Atomic F right plain language but then truly if he didn't give everybody a choice then he's not right so you'll find out that he's dealing with your choice right yes but that's I just want to I I just want to know what I am I want to know you don't thrill me brother brother Dale you make me think and I get all confused in my brain no no no no you don't get confused cuz I say it I just expose your confusion right but you see would tell us all about how great we are how you going to know that this is the greatest thing there is to me is to know how God done something and you know then I can depend on it always right cuz if you ever done something one time is that the way of the Prophet if he ever does it one time he's got to always do it amen he can't change see he said I'm God and I change not all right look at the next one baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 928 we believe that God's church is that seed that's mixed down through this realm down through here and it come in by what we spoke of last night and we'll further discuss it predestination not that God predestines predestines the plural of predestin anything to be but by for knowledge he can predestinate for he know all things and we found out last night that there's nobody ever got saved like tonight and had their name wrote on the Lambe book of life that didn't work your name was either put on the Lambe book of life before the world began or it never was there and never will be there and we find out when God slay the lamb before the foundation of the world you were slain with your lamb okay amen so now we come down to understanding one thing we'll get to it in a minute let's see yep let's go to number four on your notes then we'll get the backs side of that one just in a second let go to number four on your notes Jehovah gy part two 1962 706 now there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense there is a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense right now as I said when Daddy said does God know if I'm going to pick that bow theot and the mom said yes he said well let I'll just fool him I won't pick it now that's their stupidity of her mind right that's the rotten nonsense that man has the idea yeah all right so we'll get back to that in a second the next one we'll come on down on some more but look at the one that doesn't have any notes on it I want to bring out a little point to you see we say uh God God this is organizational teachings well if God predestines and it doesn't matter to them if you call it for knowledge they ain't going to worry about it they ain't going to change them but if you say well you know predestination well that means god for ordained everything before the world you got to say yes or else it wouldn't God right right God for knew all things you got to agree yes right well then you say well I don't have a choice I don't have a choice and see in the message they're saying now that it's not whosoever will so that's for the organizations see you know you can go into a lot of thing brother dick knows the doctrine of the Presbyterian they have it like this well it's predestinated I step off of this thing so I might as well go ahead and step off get it done that's just their thoughts you know you know but see they call it predestination and they think well you know it's just if God said I'm going to be saved I make no difference I'm going to be saved CU God says I'm going to be lost don't make no difference I'm going to be lost well there's a lot truth to that but it's not all lined up amen that's right all right that's right so there's a lot of nonsense in the doctrines of predestination as a matter of fact most Baptists never known anything about it but the Baptist Church was totally split back there many many years back in the beginnings over two brothers arguing on predestination but see what about you and I what do we think about we say well we don't have a choice do we believe that like they're teaching in the message now that says we don't have a choice do we believe organizational point of what do we don't have a choice cuz if it's already stamped sealed finished then you know we don't have a choice all right among the message they're saying we don't we don't want that part of whosoever will we don't want that the choice is for others how was eternal before the world always was and you can't tell me I wouldn't always Eternal well I'm not going to try to cuz it ain't going to do no good but listen to what your Prophet had to say about whosoever will looking at the Unseen 19594 and he's bringing down whosoever will he said all that's willing to come and anybody whosoever I'd rather he'd said whosoever than to say William Brandon amen there might be more William Brams but when he said whosoever I know he meant me and that gives me a change whosoever may come and drink of the Waters of life God coming in whosoever will so he said there might be more William Brams but when it said whosoever will see I want to keep that don't you conference with God tiffon Georgia 1960 108 it's a very familiar old scripture text and just thought on it as I come down today and was thinking of that is a striking thing when God the creator of heavens and earth would invite his creation mankind to come reason with him now there's another one we don't reason brother well the Bible says come reason right that doesn't mean you're reasoning that's right it means you lay down your reasoning and you sit down and listen to God and then when it's all finished what God Said is the only thing that's reasonable right we see that's the way people are become reason with him what an honor to have God to invite an invit to give an invitation you know he didn't have to do that but he did it and he invited whosoever will may come he just didn't select a certain person or a certain group or a certain denomination or a certain color he said whosoever will let him come and then I'm sure that that means every one of us has a right that does me better tonight to know that then it would have been if the scripture said let William brandom come because there might be more than one William Brown but when he said whosoever will I know that it includes me and it includes you and we all have a right to the Tree of Life am all right one more paragraph 46 Revelation chap 1 1960 1204 he's talking about the little church has always been in the majority like the Pentecostal church and Pentecost is not an organization Pentecost is an experience that goes to whosoever will right Catholic Jew proelite Methodist Baptist who whoever will let him come it's an experience that the individual God doesn't deal with a denomination neither does he deal into Gentiles as a a race or a people he deals with individuals whosoever will let him be white black yellow brown Methodist Baptist president what Protestant catholic whatever he is let him come whosoever I'm so glad GL he made it that way I'm like the fell said once I'd rather he'd say that than to call my name William brandham come because there might be more than one William brandham but when he said whosoever will I know that took me so that's the way we can all feel whosoever will let him come now so that does away with our own thoughts as I said that we we think about you know predestination well that that means Destiny determined beforehand because predestination is the past tense of predestinate or you know and predestinated would go in between the predestinate and predestinated and then predestination goes all the way to show you that it's totally done right right the predestinated can be back here to discuss the point predestination can be what you can argue predestinate can be what you can argue about but when you say predestination that's why the prophet said it's a bad word to use before an untrained congregation because predestination literally means Destiny determined beforehand right right but see do we believe that do we believe predestination do we believe what it can be see or do we just want to be you know like the ones as we read about here all right but let's read some things brother Bram said so go back to number four when you notes Jehovah Gyra part 2 6276 there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense but there really is a true predestination God by for knowledge could predestinate because he has for knowledge now watch it God's not willing that any should perish but being the infinite God knew that who would perish and who would not right that's the reason he said before Isa or before Jacob or Esau was born he hated Esau and loved Jacob his forn knowledge let him know that Esau was was a Shyer and he let and he let him know that Jacob represented that or respected excuse me that Birthright regardless of how he got it he wanted it now both boys see in the message they say well one didn't have no choice the other one didn't have no choice and other one CA in the seed you know now I like this but both boys twins born from the same holy mother and father but one was a renegade and the other uh was a Believer and God by his for knowledge knew that y all right so how does God predestinate by for knowledge if he's infinite see then he would predestinate according to his forn knowledge see of the thing right and then that way as we'll get to back in in a minute then the thing for him can't say see because I believe that you that God predestines according to your desires right not according to his we'll read that in a minute he predestines according to your desires okay right he it's basing upon what you want well that sure makes L that makes a wonderful great God that he's got trillions of trillions of all times upon the Earth of people that one day he's going to have to condemn some glorify some uh all kind of things you going to have to do and yet he knows all all about it right to me now to realize predestination is based upon what I desire more than it's based upon what he desires right that brings me to a place of a Consciousness within my own being that I do have something to do with this right and then that his choosing is not that he just I choose this one reject that I just just but yet it's based upon what you desire see that but it also goes when we have a choice it goes to another point that at judgment our thoughts our choices will be brought forth that's right amen if we have to stand before a judgment all right and even if we don't even if we do make it in the bride there are two judgments there's a judgment whether or not you're deciding to have eternal life you know to go into it uh you know and to be lost or there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad and we're all going to have to give an account right so it's still based upon our choice right we're not hiding anything you can get by with it with me you can get by with everybody you know like I've always said what's the problem that makes Crooks get caught what what gets a murderer caught more than anything in the world he's Perfect Crime everything's covered no fingerprints no nothing nothing can connect him to it what happens he gets drunk he gets lonely he gets so down and out you know and he starts confessing to somebody cuz he wants somebody down in the boat with with him you know because he knows and realizes that everybody's not no too good anyway so he wants you to say well that's all right brother I thought about killing a couple of people myself he wants somebody to sympathize with him so he gets caught by running his mouth amen because that's the consciousness of man the part of you being a soul animal can go out and kill and just come on back he don't worry about it he don't have to explain to nobody later about it right he goes out and does it again see but yet we have a soul which makes us a conscious am all right now I'm trying to hit everything see the word that we want you know and then I hit a few things because up before I read them because I know what a lot of people do when they're turning we can tell how many is listening as Wade was said the other day we can tell how many is connecting on but we don't know how long they listen so you know what s a lot of us done today when I said pre predestination said for knowledge and I said that about Choice a lot of the computers went flat and they ain't listening so I try to put a little in on down here that if that judgment day it'll be brought back that's right so you remember what that man said that brother brand said that he didn't predestinate according to his desire well I don't know that won't be no good at judgment you can tell me all you want to that you don't know brother BR said some things and I'm going to say well why you you getting upset cuz I said it you know you read it I just don't have the ability like brother randam to be able to go back and tell you the DAT you read it I'm glad of that am I don't want that I want to be what I am all right see I'm just trying to make it into a line that'll help us all to understand look at the message number five of you notes of Queen of Sheba 1958 uh 125 he's talking about people that were ordained to that condemnation that's the book of Jude all right that's the scriptures if you're a Believer tonight you should bow your head in reverence and humbleness to thank God that he chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world because no man can come to me Jesus said except my father draws him and God by for knowledge not willing that any should perish but by for knowledge knew who would so he could predestinate from the beginning all things Jesus come to save those who the father saw before the foundation of the world that would be saved going down to the next Super sign 63129 God knowed the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes God is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time sometimes we get weary upset we get hly we think oh we must do this or do that but remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great for knowledge his for knowledge for by for knowledge he could predestinate not by his desires but by his forn knowledge God doesn't predestinate by his desire now that's as plain as can be he's not willing that any should perish but by for knowledge he knew who would accepted and who would not therefore he could make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could for tell the end from the beginning therefore he knew that we'd live in this day he knew that this would be our day he had had plans for this day he had plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever fail that's right he's always on time how does God predestinate by his for knowledge now according to brother Maloney that was telling me about the Greek word for that years ago and uh you know I I don't know no Greek anyway but it made a good point but he said really the definition of for knowledge you know and things like that it is simple in uh Greek or Hebrew terminologies it means that you're standing looking with totally unlimited eyesight you know well now you know what Einstein said you'll see right Einstein says if you're looking out totally with unlimited eyesight that you're looking at the back of your head he said because everything is in a circle right it comes right around you see the back of your head because everything is in a circle there's no such thing as all of these things as we think about it everything is in a circle we're moving in a circle we're not it's not you know and and see but see now the word then meaning unlimited see to see that God before the world would ever even begin before there was anything whatsoever in any air space or anything that we can calculate of what we call this realm that God in his for knowledge could look all the way down through time and not make you and I do anything that's right but know what to do to contact us and I know what the organization say about that and I wonder about the people the message argum it see they said well look at Paul said God knocked him down to make him no no he just knocked him off the horse to get his attention he knew that's what it take what it take to get yours amen right a man at dille wanted to change and be on the night shift because his daughter was um having problems and things and you know invalid style and I changed with him for 30 days and you know what I ran up into a fell that you know he was looking for some answers and then one day I got an inspector ction and we wound up later getting back together again you know well you know I guess that was just an accident you know I've always told you I'm the baby of 13 my daddy was 65 years old when I was born my mother was 42 there's 13 of us and if you don't believe in predestination you got a problem I'm just glad they saved the best of last that's the only thing I can say about Dad all right but now think about God's forn knowledge now can he think of something can God think of something and then change that now he can add to his understanding we know that as he would reveal it when he would show first church a in the second Church age third fourth fifth he can keep adding to but it's not adding to anything it's just unfolding what you see amen but can he have a thought and then have another thought contrary to that well I I I I was going to save Danny Fountain but I just decided I didn't want to now that's the way we think right right but then too you'll find out that God doesn't put it on how good you are right cuz he doesn't deal in that type of business ain't none of us nothing but garbage canins right that's all we was all we'll ever be in human life right nothing good about us he didn't choose because of something good he chose he chose because he knew what you'd choose right that's for knowledge right well what about this great pre brother tell that just I want to know about this Hang on we're going to get down one of these days until a question I ask you and I don't know how long it'll take but we'll get there I asked you a question I said how many times can you find the soul of God in the Old Testament you can find a lot of other things but can you see it made manifest back there well yeah I can see it in it I'm not saying that I'm saying there wouldn't no children of God until the New Testament okay right they didn't have the Born Again experience in the Old Testament no way all right so then it might encourage you to listen to what I'm saying but if we don't get this out of the way when you come up to that you'll say you know I just don't understand because look what's happened yeah look how brother randam said it one day like this he said he had to mix this with this and this with this and that with this and this with this to get you here y that's right you ever noticed that quote Amen to get you here that's right how do you wind up Mama and Daddy's blackheaded Grandma and Grandpa on both Sid blackheaded you know and you got a blunt-headed child I think something went wrong we go get your a DNA and find out but then you go back through the lineage and you find out somewh way back there great great great grandma y was blune headed they come all the way down see God knows what he's doing don't worry about it and everything's right on time don't worry about it just be on time yourself right and and and try to understand what's right all right so now he never desired anybody to be lost he want I want to read these because people say when I you know you just preaching your own Doctrine well so we read what number six all right let's go over to to number seven doesn't look like a seven that's what it's supposed to be but any it's Harvest Time 1964 12 12 I Chang these things so many times until you know I have to move my numbers around I want to keep you in line all right but what did he say now he's talking about the word for the age and he said God scattered his word out now we're not going to go into this we're still on for knowledge okay we're not going to go into the word part and all like that right now we're going to prove predestination by full knowledge right okay now he said he's infinite and he he's omnipresent in omniscient therefore he knows all things he can't be present everywhere but by be by being omniscient knowing all things then he can be present everywhere so that goes back to the other one what too right because that's the way he predestines By Us by for knowledge not because he desired that this person should be saved and this one lost but he knew who who would be lost and who would be saved see therefore by his for knowledge he can predestinate amen and he makes everything work to his glory that's what his attributes are doing displaying to his displaying to his glory one vessel of Honor One Of Dishonor but is it God that maketh it not him that willth or that runneth but God that showeth Mercy all right now I thought I'd get away on over let's go down to the next one where Pentecost failed not where I think Pentecost failed 55 1111 now the word is used in here in the fifth chapter he talking about in Ephesians predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use because it kind of confuses people when you say predestinate predestination speaks no what looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks to Destin destination predestination goes back to forn knowledge forn knowledge goes to destination I got a couple of these but I'm not going to get into that okay cuz I'm holding the point to try to get you to see for knowledge right then we'll go back and see it is really true in other words God didn't say now God didn't say this now I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning so order to forn knowledge that he order to forn knowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that amen that's truly scriptural now one of these days we're going to get down to a very familiar scripture that people don't like and that's Ephesians you know where it says that he gave some Apostles and some prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers right and brother Brown said he predestined that yep right see we don't think about the fivefold ministry being predestined we think of the prophets being predestined right okay we're going somewhere see in other words God didn't say now I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man to be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning so in order to forn knowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and know where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that that's truly scriptural put on to the next e19 faith of Abraham 55 uh 11:18 and predestination is a hard word among a Congregation of people because predestination really forn knowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to forn knowledge and for knowledge looks on to Destiny that God being an infinite now he's explaining these things in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what God what people would do so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore he before Esau or Jacob either one was born God could God could say Esau I've hated and Jacob I've Loved because he forew what they could be he never made Esau the way he was he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice God knew what would take what new would take that way so that's how he knows knows us today he knows your heart and if you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool God cuz he knows your heart all right but now we'll get back to that where he's talking about predestination looking back to forn knowledge for knowledge looking to Destin Destiny we'll get back to that so don't get tied up in it now just stay with me on what I'm trying to prove I'm trying to prove to one point what God's covenant with Abraham 56-23 he said now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for a halfhazard thought amen are you reading y see now this is what my brother says my brother says that he believes that certain places that there were certain prophets certain people Jesus being pre-ordained to be here he said he believed it that way but everything else was just on any other point but see he believes that Jesus come and says well you know God sent down you know have the denomination TR God sent down his son you know to where that he could die that maybe some people would feel sorry for him and get saved now that's what he's a pres he's a Methodist Theologian and that's evidently probably what they taught him in college see that he just does it hophazardly well listen to your prophet now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for a h Hazard thought well I'll die up there perhaps maybe some somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved so no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus come for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that God fornew right would be redeemed see now God's not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but in order to be God he had to know now the word predestinate as is used in Ephesians 1:5 predestinate there isn't a good word it means in speaking of predestination to the people sometimes leads them to think that God just predestinated you to push you through a little pipe or something that's not right predestination looks back to forn knowledge and forn knowledge looks to Destiny I said I won't try to Express that point but I will say this much you do have something to do with your predestination that quote just proves it amen cuz God don't put you in a pot and push you through the other end all right we'll come back to that quote later but he don't do that he don't put you in there and just push you to that's the way it's got to be no you got a choice why would it be say said to Brother brandham by the U was it the tongues and interpretation of Danny Henry which one was it because of the choice that you have made a great portion of Heaven awaits you that's it what a choice that he make right brother Adam is not one to bypass anything he's going to be just like you and I he's going to be judged according to his desires right and if he didn't correct those things he's got a problem right I trouble saying those things because that's the way all human beings are we're all going to give an account right of the reason why we had that idea well I just don't like brother Dale course that's what all of you say when you come here you say well we was all talk you know sister was saying it last night you know we was we know we in other words you heard so much about brother Dale you you you thought he was so messed up till you just didn't want to fool with him well you know people's going to have to give an account for that one day amen that's right I mean they'll have to answer that point but that's their business that ain't mine I still love them I still fellowship with them you know and I don't have no problems why cuz I'm I want Christ to be made manifest not Samuel Dale or some Doctrine right the church has got to have a Doctrine sure but you don't have to put it in the wrong way right and listen he said he didn't God do it that way so here's another one God keeps his word 5747 and Jesus never come to Earth just to say I'll have preachers go out and preach some tell them about what I done and maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and get saved God don't run his office like that there God at the beginning know exactly who would be saved Jesus come to save those that God knew would be saved he wasn't willing that they'd be lost but but to be God he knowed who would be lost and who would be saved therefore he could predestinate not predestinate this he he he for by for knowledge he could set in order to make everything work to his glory because that's now I like this one now the devil isn't omnipresent nor omnipotent neither does he know the end from the beginning see we give the devil credit of knowing a lot of things and I do too a lot of times about it but you know come find out he doesn't know as much as we think he knows that's right see all right amen God Only God Alone knows it he doesn't know the end from the beginning God Alone knows it you know what we do that's why brother brother said if I keep something within my heart and don't tell nobody about it he said devil can't bother me but he said if I go tell somebody he said devil will beat me there that's right in another words cuz he know something fixing to happen right now I I've always like liked it like this I believe that he knows when that angel that's with you I believe he knows about him all about everything and your own personal angel that when he's coming towards you and something's being done Satan will automatically try to hinder that so that's why sometimes he makes us sick sometimes he makes us of problems and all and I don't glory in sicknesses but if we take our sickness in the right direction and let it be for God's honor and glory to be healed not honor and glory to be sick honor and glory to be healed delivered as a witness then it's a wonderful thing to be sick right but we look at it as a you know as a problem and I do too first thing happens when I get sick what did I say what did I do wrong I'm a human I'm just like you I said Lord what did I do wrong all I'm doing is studying your word trying my best to preach and screaming and the people and and here I am telling them about healing and you you letting me be sick well we don't have nothing to do with that right but we got something to do with believing right right if we believe it God can release it all right okay five Junctions of time 56 122 did you ever read over there in Romans 9 how did he said before either boy was born Esau and Jacob said I hate one and love the other how can he be just and do that now that around is asking you a simple question how can God be just and condemn Esau and love Jacob he's asking you a simple question do you know him I hate one I love the other how can he be just and do that by for knowledge he knew what a rascal Esau was see and he could predestinate not just say say that the word predestinate is not a good word to use it's for knowledge because he wouldn't just listen at deliberately turn you away can't you see him dealing with Judas when his for knowledge to let him know exactly what Judas would wind up being can't you see his for knowledge and he would know exactly what Cain would do but yet he's still dealing with Cain and saying if you'd have made the right choice like your brother even if you'd go do right now that's why we blame Judas and we say Judas was this that of the other well what are we right he said all Judas was just a rascal Peter was worse Rascal cuz Judas never did deny Jesus he told him who he was right he led him to him right right Peter was one tonight even cing doing it yeah we want to make one so great yeah okay but listen just that deliberately turn you away because it's because you have there another words in other words you've done something you you know he wants you in other words just listen you you you got to read brother Brandon but you got to know what he's saying go read that next part you're saying right there just read it without understanding because because you have he wants you to go away yeah right now that's not what brother around and say well what do you mean I word for word yeah yeah but that's know what he's saying right he's not saying he wants you to go he's telling you because because you have other words he don't want you to go away he wants you saved that's right amen but we think he wants us to go away Satan's the one who wants us to go away he's not willing that any of you should perish but by full knowledge he know that they'll do even before you that what you'll do even before you come on Earth sure for knowledge okay I got to read fast let me Christ The Mystery of God reveal 63 7:28 God never just said I'll choose this one and I'll choose that one but he knew by his reason he could predestinate is because he's infinite and he he knows he's infinite so therefore he know everything he know the end he could tell the end from the beginning he's God If he if he can't do that he's not God now that's plain as could be around blunt I like to be that away but listen I don't have time to read all the rest of these but you read the rest of them all right me fast run it through in case people miss it well you just go ahead we'll get back to these and I'll bring them and we'll reread them for knowledge brother brandom says Jehovah Gyra 581 127 first forn knowledge allows him to predestinate all things to work to his glory you see what I'm talking about now what is how does God predestinate by his for knowled well brother D I thought it was all this seed that was in us and all all of these things like that see that's where your thinking is messed up he doesn't predestinate according to his desires cuz if he does the thing formed could say you made me this way and you can't judge me my brother says that he said God made me a sinner and he cannot condemn me for being a sinner I said you're wrong you made yourself a sinner God did not make you one right you made a choice We were put in the pawn shop oh that look like God told us in the pawn shop we put oursel in the pawn shop we had a choice when we come to the free moral agency we could have accepted Jesus Christ or rejected him we could have went on but instead we rejected him we went out into the world we put oursel in the pawn shop we put oursel in the Devil's Hole and then blame God for putting us there sure God knew by four knowledge that we would go there right right and he would do whatever he could would I can stand here and talk all this afternoon where down through my life I've told you about I go out and do wrong and and I'd come back home and cry about it Butz I didn't want to do it but yet I was a human mortal and in my body I wanted to do things but even as a lost and I was totally lost but yet still I had a recognition of a god see brother Brown explains it like this and you'll see where I'm going he's talking about Moses BN born with this great gift oh we can look at that in really Glory can't we do you know what he said he said every person in the world was born with that gift so whatever you give Moses give it to everybody or whatever you give to everybody give it to Moses right you got to understand what's going on but how does God predestinate by his for knowledge he could look down through time before the world ever begun and he could see everything that we would do every thought you and I would have here today God knew that before the world but you know what he didn't make you think it he didn't make you think that the devil makes you think a lot of things but God Don't Make Us thing God gives us a choice we can accept him or we can reject him that's right and by his forn knowledge he knew what it would be well I thought predes you know there great big mystery of of a seed and you can't understand a seed until you know what a seed is right what kind of seed you talking about right come on brother that's right what kind of a seed you talking about beans potatoes corn well I was born BL god with this seed in me then it was in there by for knowledge y amen amen right we've got read on those quotes I'll bring them back when I preach Wednesday bring the you know again just bring you quotes there we play the tape this afternoon but Wednesday we'll get brother Brown says you're saved by predestination amen I thought I saved by grace through faith that's what predestination is Grace through faith amen amen see it's all right when we get it together but see that way the thing form can't say God you didn't give me a choice you see where the condemnation is going to be though because you and I have heard this message and we have heard the prophet explain it and the it'll be a condemnation upon us because we have no rights whatsoever here in Lula to argue the point of whether or not I well I don't know whether I was a seed or whether I wasn't a seed or I just can't figure this out we've been over this for 40 years right sure we still have things that we wonder about but for 40 years we've been through these things how many times how many series have I preached on predestination that's right brother raay pulling them down and putting them fixing some of them now maybe we can hear it what we got 364 in let's stand and
