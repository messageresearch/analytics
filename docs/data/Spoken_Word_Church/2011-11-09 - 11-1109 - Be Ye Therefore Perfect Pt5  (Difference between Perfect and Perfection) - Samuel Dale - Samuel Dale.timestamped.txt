[18:42] a little Abby she's sick today and so
[18:45] just remember her she's got a thing
[18:46] that's going around and I think the
[18:49] technical way they call it was the hoof
[18:50] and mouth disease so it wasn't the old
[18:53] days of it but it's it's from hand and
[18:56] mouth and and things and it's just a
[18:58] apart so she didn't choose to come
[19:01] tonight and know but that's you know
[19:04] just pray to the Lord she's okay with
[19:05] running just a little mild temperature
[19:08] and but just pray that everything will
[19:09] be all right amen amen so let's go into
[19:12] the scriptures and then we'll pray and
[19:14] uh just take on these things I've been
[19:17] trying for a while to get something to
[19:19] you and maybe tonight we will just I
[19:22] really didn't have anything written down
[19:23] or quotes or anything just something
[19:25] laying here and there and and so we'll
[19:27] just try to go to the best way we can
[19:29] tonight to see what we can talk about
[19:32] from this scripture but let's
[19:33] pray Lord Jesus we thank you Father for
[19:37] the day and the hour that we have upon
[19:40] the Earth we thank you for your love and
[19:42] your grace and to us thank you for
[19:45] salvation thank you for peace thank you
[19:47] for all things thank you for being you
[19:51] cuz that way we can depend upon it and
[19:53] you don't change so then we don't have
[19:55] to worry we can just rest in you we love
[19:57] you and we thank you you bless those
[19:59] that are sick remember Little abig Grace
[20:01] there Lord and take away that problem
[20:03] remember all of us here together and
[20:05] Lord the sickness is among us because
[20:07] you said in your word that you sent your
[20:08] word and healed us and delivered us from
[20:10] destruction and Lord we love you and we
[20:12] thank you have your way tonight in the
[20:14] service bless and guide each one in
[20:17] Jesus name amen let's go to Matthew 5
[20:22] we've been reading from verse 37 through
[20:25] 48 then we'll go to Romans 4
[20:31] let your communication be yay yay nay
[20:33] nay for whatsoever is more than these
[20:35] cometh of evil you have heard that it
[20:38] hath been said an eye for an eye and a
[20:39] tooth for a tooth but I say unto you
[20:42] that you resist not evil and whosoever
[20:46] shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn
[20:48] to him the other also and if any man was
[20:52] Will soe thee at the law and take away
[20:55] thy Coke let him have thy cloak also now
[20:58] that's remember the background the
[21:00] Beatitudes be your attitude now the Lord
[21:04] Jesus is showing how his attitude of the
[21:08] way he is so that's what he expects us
[21:11] to do to have in this see that would be
[21:13] the be attitudes to you and I you know
[21:16] be our attitude in other words be it to
[21:18] the right
[21:20] place and whosoever shall compel thee to
[21:22] go a mile go with him Twain give to him
[21:25] that asketh thee and from him that would
[21:27] Bor of Thee turn not thou away you have
[21:30] heard that it hath been said Thou shalt
[21:32] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[21:35] but I say unto you love your enemies
[21:38] bless them that curse you and do good to
[21:40] them that hate you and pray for them
[21:42] which despitefully use you and persecute
[21:45] not that you may be the children of your
[21:48] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[21:50] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[21:53] good and send us reain on the just and
[21:55] the unjust that we may be the children
[21:57] of God that we may be able to do like
[21:59] God does right right now cuz this is
[22:02] what it's describing for if you love
[22:05] them which love you what reward have you
[22:07] do not even the publicans the saint and
[22:10] if you salute your brethren only what do
[22:13] ye more than others do not even the
[22:16] public and so be therefore perfect even
[22:19] as your father which is in heaven is
[22:22] perfect all right now we go over to
[22:25] Romans 4
[22:28] and we'll begin reading verse one to get
[22:30] the
[22:32] point what shall we say then that
[22:36] Abraham our father as pertaining to the
[22:38] flesh had
[22:40] found now watch for If Abraham were
[22:43] justified by works he ha where of to
[22:47] Glory but not before God okay plain
[22:50] language right for what saith the
[22:53] scripture Abraham believed God and it
[22:55] was in it was counted unto him for
[22:58] righteous
[23:00] and to him that worketh is the reward
[23:02] not reckoned of Grace but of debt see if
[23:04] he worked for it there something he
[23:06] could do it wouldn't be Grace see right
[23:10] it would be some reward but to him that
[23:13] worketh not but believeth on him that
[23:16] justifi the ungodly his faith is counted
[23:18] for righteousness even as David also
[23:21] describeth the blessedness of the man
[23:23] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[23:25] without
[23:26] works saying bless are they whose
[23:29] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[23:32] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[23:35] the Lord will not impute sin amen you
[23:39] may be seated Lord that his Blessing to
[23:41] the reading of the word now what about a
[23:44] man we want to just go back and try to
[23:46] use that in David well that would be
[23:48] even greater than try to using it in the
[23:51] New Testament part but what about a man
[23:54] that God will not impute sin impute
[23:56] means to reckon or count you know us to
[24:00] establish against him all right you say
[24:03] well now that's impossible I agree with
[24:05] you that's the one thing I want tonight
[24:08] to to try to express to
[24:11] you where that you can say well this is
[24:15] what brother Dale believes and that way
[24:19] then you won't be saying what does he
[24:21] believe right you know cuz we used we
[24:24] came up through the Baptist and I'm not
[24:25] throwing off on them just because we
[24:27] came there but they'd preach one service
[24:30] be you therefore perfect even as your
[24:32] father in Heaven is perfect and they'd
[24:33] have you you know feeling good maybe and
[24:36] I'm just making the point of it maybe
[24:38] the next service or so down the road
[24:40] they would preach there's none good no
[24:42] not one and they condemn everybody so
[24:45] you never could get to a right part of
[24:47] trying to have faith because you didn't
[24:50] know what it was they didn't lay it out
[24:53] but now we went through a good many of
[24:57] the services declaring what brother
[24:59] Brown said that when Jesus said in
[25:01] Matthew there 5:48 to be therefore
[25:05] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[25:07] perfect that to require
[25:10] that meant that he had to make a way
[25:15] that's right or he would have not
[25:17] required it see then you say well
[25:19] there's none perfect no not one now
[25:22] there's a quote in here in a minute that
[25:24] you'll see brother R said see right now
[25:25] you got a contradiction
[25:28] see that's where people call
[25:30] contradictions where it says None good
[25:32] no not one and then the other say be
[25:34] therefore
[25:35] perfect but see those are not
[25:38] contradictions those are scriptures
[25:40] right once placed in the correct order
[25:43] right we bring a correct understanding
[25:46] all right so then it won't be one
[25:47] fighting the other you know all right
[25:50] but now get to Point see we say but we
[25:52] can't be perfect I agree with
[25:56] you there's no way than any human
[26:00] mortal I don't care where it's brother
[26:02] brandom or who you want to talk about
[26:04] right no human mortal outside of the
[26:08] Lord Jesus Christ could qualify in any
[26:12] form to be talking about being perfect
[26:16] right I agree with you right all right
[26:20] but then I've got to go on the opposite
[26:21] side of it and say I don't agree with
[26:22] you
[26:24] right and even go on to the point now
[26:27] that the human
[26:29] element we're dealing with Body Spirit
[26:32] and soul right
[26:35] right a person can be perfectly totally
[26:42] sinless right and then still turn around
[26:45] and be like brother brandham and says
[26:47] brother brandham do you sin he said
[26:49] every day
[26:51] right now that's what I said we need to
[26:54] Define sin a lot of times because people
[26:57] get all involved involved in the
[26:59] definitions of
[27:00] words but now did Brother R say he
[27:04] disbelieved the word he said show me
[27:06] where I've ever disbelieved right right
[27:08] well then he's not talking about the
[27:10] word sin which means
[27:13] unbelief of disbelieving the word he's
[27:17] talking about the same thing if we have
[27:20] time to get back to it that Paul gets
[27:22] into Romans about the 7eventh chapter
[27:25] and that's where he's expressing that
[27:27] the things I would I do not the things I
[27:29] do I would not in this backwards and
[27:31] forth he said well then with one said I
[27:34] serve the
[27:36] law of
[27:38] Faith that's from the inward man all
[27:42] right but said in the Natural Life out
[27:44] here I saw serve the law of the flesh
[27:48] which means what now that doesn't mean
[27:51] that well with my flesh I can't help it
[27:54] so I just got to commit adultery every
[27:56] once in a while you know now he's not
[27:58] talking about junk I'll be glad to show
[28:01] you where brother R Expresses in conduct
[28:03] order and doctrine that he was talking
[28:05] about natural everyday life not sinful
[28:11] things PA wouldn't say I just can't Happ
[28:14] it you know I just have to lust cuz I'm
[28:17] in this body no he was talking about
[28:20] natural
[28:22] things he said even to the basis of of
[28:26] uh I'm too tired to go to church
[28:28] church he said then I let my body
[28:31] rule over my
[28:34] going and said I don't go
[28:36] MBE like I've always told you you let
[28:39] that old body rule you you said well I'm
[28:42] so tired till I just can't go and the
[28:45] devil said that's right you tired you're
[28:48] wore out just take a day off you know
[28:51] don't go to church well about the time
[28:54] that the service starts here the devil's
[28:56] going to change his tactic
[28:58] and he's going to say I told you you
[29:01] wouldn't a Christian cuz if you would
[29:02] you would have went that's right right
[29:04] so you'll never win with him you might
[29:07] as well get up and go on and forget it
[29:09] or either go to bed and go to sleep you
[29:12] know cuz you're never going to win over
[29:13] the Devil he's going to have a trick
[29:15] either way the way you go all right but
[29:19] now we covered the life message where
[29:22] brother randam
[29:25] said said we're either perfect
[29:29] or we're
[29:31] lost you remember the quote he said
[29:33] you're either perfect or you're lost
[29:36] right he said there's no middle
[29:39] area no black white
[29:42] bird no siner
[29:45] saint no drunk and sober man right won't
[29:49] work all right he says if we're not
[29:54] perfect we can't go to heaven right
[30:00] so now we might to get away from our old
[30:04] Theology of n good no not one you think
[30:08] you're
[30:09] perfect and I told you then they come up
[30:11] with the idea and I saw the bumper
[30:13] sticker and said I'm not perfect I'm
[30:15] just forgiven yeah well if you're
[30:18] forgiven then according to God he don't
[30:21] remember
[30:22] it how much more perfect would you want
[30:25] than the fact that a God can can be to
[30:27] the basis that he can forget right right
[30:30] amen right don't ask me how he does it
[30:34] not I can't and you can't right I
[30:39] remember everything I done just about it
[30:40] in life right but God can't remember any
[30:43] of it that I put under the
[30:45] B when are we going to get down to
[30:47] believing it like
[30:50] that and accepting What God
[30:55] Says for us that's right
[30:58] I gave you or two three services covered
[31:01] in the Old Testament where Noah was a
[31:03] perfect man or job was a perfect man
[31:06] that's what God said about
[31:08] him well if God said he's perfect then
[31:11] who am I to try to bring up something
[31:12] about him that's right right right see
[31:15] I'm trying to bring something out of
[31:17] them under the blood that's been put
[31:19] under the blood right and you know what
[31:21] you happen there don't
[31:23] you in other words I try to draw
[31:26] something out under the blood that br
[31:27] brother Don's put under the blood you
[31:29] know what happened that thing will come
[31:31] to
[31:33] me oh no yes it will MH it'll come and
[31:38] try to get you cuz you brought it out
[31:41] under the
[31:42] blood God put it there and says it's
[31:47] gone see we try to bring it up but be
[31:49] careful what you trying to bring up
[31:50] against
[31:51] somebody it's like I told you I'm so
[31:54] glad brother random explained where it
[31:56] says are in the scripture return since
[31:58] you went over to sa for the destruction
[31:59] of the flesh that the soul might be
[32:02] saved see we used to think that the
[32:04] church had the power to just take a guy
[32:05] you know and just just turn him over
[32:08] well I found out that brother brownon
[32:10] said we turn him over to God he turns
[32:14] them over to the devil all right now see
[32:18] that's wonderful you might not think it
[32:19] is but it is for me because I'm Pastor I
[32:23] have to call a situation
[32:26] sometime and see what if I'm over here
[32:29] condemning brother klie and we're
[32:31] turning him loose and he's over at his
[32:33] house praying for all of us and don't
[32:37] ask God to forgive him what he
[32:39] donees now who's going to get in
[32:41] trouble God don't play games right so we
[32:46] turned him we'd have to we turn him over
[32:48] to God then God would Loos him CU he
[32:51] knows whether or not his heart is
[32:53] right so we're not playing with the word
[32:55] we know what the message of the hour
[32:57] bring
[32:58] right that's right but now what is the
[33:02] thought of being
[33:06] perfect
[33:10] now
[33:14] Noah he probably died a
[33:19] drunk God said he's Perfect Right his
[33:22] kids was out doing all kind of wrong
[33:24] things he made an atonement for him
[33:27] right
[33:30] God gave him his kids and Glory that's
[33:33] right that's
[33:36] Bible but you see what are we talking
[33:38] about being
[33:43] perfect the word perfect we'll get more
[33:45] on this when we get back cuz I'm just
[33:47] laying a background for something to go
[33:49] on in so you can go to Hebrews 6 and
[33:52] start studying on uh you know therefore
[33:55] leaving the principles of God let un
[33:57] principle
[33:59] of Doctrine let us go on to
[34:01] Perfection now that's what I want to ask
[34:03] you tonight so that you'll get a point
[34:05] for later
[34:06] on see in the
[34:12] Bible uh we were talking
[34:15] today and
[34:17] uh you know it's just a a human
[34:20] part and it it was like I was giving the
[34:22] illustration to brother Mark there in
[34:24] the back seat and I said but Martin you
[34:28] know what
[34:31] ovar he looked at and said
[34:34] what I
[34:37] Oar he said you know he didn't
[34:40] understand he's a northern said I said
[34:42] oh okay over
[34:46] there he said yeah he knew what I was
[34:50] saying well I said the same thing
[34:52] before I just said it in southern
[34:55] language Oar let's go oar
[34:58] amen right that's Pig Latin for
[35:02] southerners all right but my point
[35:08] was you can say something but you need
[35:10] an understanding amen that's right all
[35:13] right so when God gave us the ability to
[35:18] you know he knew that we would not have
[35:20] the ability to understand the Greek or
[35:23] the Hebrew Etc you know like that
[35:25] because we wouldn't be those people all
[35:28] right so he gave
[35:30] us a a a people like scof Fields Etc
[35:35] that would go through and uh put a lot
[35:38] of definitions to things right and he
[35:41] would give us people that would give us
[35:43] the lexicons you know that would give us
[35:47] the definitions of wording all right so
[35:51] then the word perfect when we get back
[35:53] you'll get to it and see it more it it's
[35:55] like perfect perfect perfect perfect
[35:59] perfect right so it can have many
[36:02] different meanings to the word
[36:05] perfect they made a perfect sacrifice in
[36:07] the Old Testament the Bible said I mean
[36:10] that's what it says it made a perfect
[36:13] sacrifice well now that was an
[36:18] animal but see it was perfect all right
[36:21] so I'm just asking the question tonight
[36:23] to get a little point and then we'll get
[36:24] back to the thought what's the
[36:26] difference between perfect in
[36:32] Perfection what's the difference between
[36:35] perfect and
[36:38] Perfection now they're both used in the
[36:42] Bible but to get an understanding then
[36:46] see perfect is like a condition that one
[36:50] has reached by some means right by some
[36:53] means it's run you know Perfect all
[36:55] right but perfection
[36:58] has to do with a growth
[37:02] development into the process that you're
[37:05] talking about right so that's what we
[37:07] got to break it down and we'll see then
[37:09] and get away from our human thinking of
[37:13] perfection see we've been taught all of
[37:15] our Liv this is our right hand how do we
[37:18] know they me you're a horse by hands
[37:22] whose
[37:24] hands I wouldn't want to get on a horse
[37:27] but how many hands 16 Hands is
[37:29] tall but what if you had a horse it was
[37:32] 16 Hands of brother
[37:34] Arline the suer be 20t
[37:38] tall see we we we label things by what
[37:42] words we
[37:43] use all right and so then when God gave
[37:47] us the language we have he gave us an
[37:50] ability to look up these things to be
[37:53] able to get
[37:55] definitions there's a lot of words in
[37:57] the Bible that when I begin to try to
[38:00] read the Bible I didn't have enough
[38:01] education still don't have enough
[38:02] education to understand what those words
[38:05] mean you know what I look them up the
[38:09] dictionary even some in the straight
[38:11] King James
[38:14] version I look have to look up
[38:18] definitions of
[38:20] things well because that's the way you
[38:22] find out what it
[38:23] is you said well I know what that word
[38:26] means well it might not mean that in
[38:28] that order you remember the way that I
[38:30] bring it the before and the after part
[38:33] of it will Express what it's about so go
[38:36] backward and read a little bit and go
[38:38] forward and read a little bit and you'll
[38:40] see better what the definition is all
[38:42] right but how can a human
[38:46] mortal think of being
[38:52] perfect but yet Jesus said unless our
[38:56] righteousness EX ceeds the righteousness
[38:59] of the scribes and
[39:00] Pharisees that will not enter
[39:05] Heaven now the scribes might have had
[39:07] problems because they wouldn't in that
[39:10] close
[39:11] form but the Pharisees if they had a
[39:14] problem they had a
[39:16] problem you know even the high priest
[39:19] one Mark against him he could be
[39:24] killed what do you want to try to
[39:25] compare with their lives
[39:29] that's what Paul was explaining in
[39:30] Romans the things I do and the things I
[39:33] do not whatever you know I'm Waring
[39:36] Within
[39:37] Myself and he couldn't see until he seen
[39:42] Christ so
[39:45] now being
[39:48] perfect so we admit right openly that
[39:52] there's none of us perfect right
[39:54] right there's not a human being in the
[39:57] world world that is
[39:59] perfect cuz here's what the prophet
[40:01] would say Hebrew Book he said I hate to
[40:04] think that I had to go to heaven on the
[40:07] Merit of
[40:09] myself watch
[40:12] now listen he said even if I was born
[40:17] five minutes ago
[40:19] right that's right you remember
[40:23] that now what can a five minute old baby
[40:26] do
[40:28] nothing it can't
[40:30] sin but you know what it's a product of
[40:33] sin right it come by sexi right a
[40:37] product of
[40:39] sin the psalmist David summed it up by
[40:41] saying born in sin shapen in iniquity
[40:45] come from my mother's wound to Li her
[40:47] you don't have to teach a baby how to
[40:49] lie you got to teach it how to tell the
[40:51] truth right it'll automatically learn
[40:54] how to lie
[40:57] you see
[40:58] then what would they be that we could
[41:00] think about being
[41:05] perfect right and that's what the whole
[41:07] book of Job I wish you'd read that over
[41:09] and over and
[41:11] over of the Book of Job and those three
[41:14] men came to him and told him said now
[41:18] job look at you you've lost your
[41:22] family You' lost all your cows and your
[41:25] your donkeys and your C and all the
[41:28] things you had you've lost everything
[41:30] you got said you're sitting out there
[41:32] now scraping your balls you know Rising
[41:37] balls with a piece of
[41:41] pottery did you know you done
[41:45] wrong now confess
[41:49] up but he kept telling
[41:51] me I done what God told me to do that's
[41:56] right right
[41:57] he told me to offer the
[42:02] sacrifice I've offered the
[42:05] sacrifice so thereby according to what
[42:08] God says I have no sin in my life right
[42:13] right now he wasn't saying that he
[42:15] didn't have a bad
[42:17] thought come on right he wasn't saying
[42:20] that he didn't maybe you know have
[42:22] little problems in
[42:24] life he was saying he done what God told
[42:27] told him to do right right God told
[42:30] Abraham remember there in the scripture
[42:32] said walk before me and be thy
[42:36] perfect now what could Abraham do we
[42:39] read over here in Romans that he
[42:42] couldn't rely upon the things he had
[42:44] done or not done or whatever he
[42:47] was he could not rely upon that that's
[42:51] what I was trying to get you to see
[42:52] there the the Sunday I guess it was that
[42:54] the great Apostle Paul
[42:58] so the Pharisee the
[43:01] Pharisees concerning the law blameless
[43:04] he said that's
[43:06] right but he said I found that that I
[43:10] thought was
[43:11] life I found it to be death
[43:15] right why because he thought
[43:18] like job like Noah like all the others
[43:22] back there the best they could think was
[43:24] I've done what God told me yeah
[43:28] right so I I've got to be
[43:32] right in the world cuz God covered
[43:36] him but when job seen the Redeemer
[43:40] that's right coming then he seen the one
[43:43] that would stand between that's right
[43:45] amen he said I'm covered of God there's
[43:48] a covered over me said oh I
[43:53] would just paraphrasing him I would that
[43:56] somebody would
[43:57] come and just take my hand and hold
[44:00] God's hand and bring us together yes
[44:03] amen he longed for that cuz he seen
[44:05] something about himself wasn't right
[44:08] right but when that would come you know
[44:10] he said I know my redeemer
[44:13] liveth he saw the coming of the Messiah
[44:16] he saw the one that would take away all
[44:19] of his problems that's right but no
[44:22] matter if they were covered by the
[44:24] blood they could not enter in to eternal
[44:28] life under those situations right right
[44:31] because eternal life was not
[44:34] there it had to come in a man one day to
[44:37] walk upon the
[44:39] Earth and he had to give his life for us
[44:43] to be able to receive eternal life but
[44:46] if God looked at them back there and
[44:47] called him perfect cuz he done what he
[44:50] said all
[44:52] right then how much
[44:55] more would he look at us through the
[44:57] blood of Jesus
[44:59] Christ right and the blood of Jesus
[45:02] Christ covers the whole world
[45:04] today there's no sinner in the presence
[45:07] of God he got to kill it think about it
[45:11] so the blood of Jesus Christ covered the
[45:12] world as well as the blood of bulls and
[45:14] goats had it covered in an example
[45:18] right all right and in doing that it
[45:22] brings us as to human beings
[45:27] that as far as the inward part of us
[45:30] which is the New Birth the
[45:32] soul you're born
[45:34] again you have eternal
[45:36] life that soul is as perfect and pure
[45:40] and eternal if you have eternal life if
[45:44] you've accepted Jesus Christ and he's
[45:45] accepted you and gave you the new birth
[45:48] you have eternal life now if you've done
[45:50] it through the head that that won't
[45:52] work if it's really a possession now
[45:55] right I'm not talking about everybody
[45:57] comes to the alar and said I want to be
[45:58] saved right you remember I was trying to
[46:01] express that by the Old Testament people
[46:03] that resurrected it said many of the old
[46:05] didn't say all of them right there was
[46:08] some reason that all of them didn't come
[46:10] up but
[46:13] now to look at it then end the soul is
[46:16] perfect by the new birth but we're still
[46:20] living in this
[46:23] body Paul calls it there in Romans
[46:27] this body of
[46:29] death
[46:32] right he calls it that in the the 8th
[46:36] chapter no seventh chapter I think it's
[46:39] verse yes seventh
[46:42] chapter who can deliver me from this
[46:44] body of
[46:46] death he knew he had a problem with the
[46:50] body right don't be like the Baptist
[46:53] used to be cuz that's the way they
[46:55] preached it they said Paul was writing
[46:58] his
[47:00] life chapter 1 2 3 4 5
[47:03] 6 that he was writing his life of trying
[47:07] to be
[47:09] saved in chapter 7 he comes to more or
[47:12] less a position or place of being able
[47:15] to be
[47:16] saved in chapter uh chapter 7even
[47:20] chapter 8 there is therefore now no
[47:22] condemnation them that are in Christ
[47:23] Jesus verse one all right see that's the
[47:26] way the B has preached
[47:28] it but I don't believe that I believe
[47:31] Paul was explaining chapter 1 2 3 4 5 6
[47:34] 7 8 and all of that his life in Christ
[47:38] right so he saying who can deliver me
[47:40] from this
[47:42] body he said I I want to be of the out
[47:47] Resurrection you remember that in
[47:48] scripture
[47:50] right now why would he want to be out
[47:55] Resurrection he knew he had the
[47:57] resurrection inside of him he he
[47:59] explained it by the new
[48:01] birth but he wanted an out Resurrection
[48:04] out from the unbelief really he wanted
[48:06] to change of the body just put it in
[48:09] plain language he wanted this body
[48:11] redeemed and he realized as long as he
[48:14] was in this body he was having trouble
[48:16] now watch
[48:18] it according to the law of
[48:22] blindess all
[48:24] right then he says I find out this thing
[48:27] is killing
[48:30] me he never recognized his little parts
[48:35] of his
[48:37] life that was
[48:39] human of a wrong thought CU remember
[48:42] under the Old Testament wrong thought
[48:44] wouldn't wouldn't I mean you could lust
[48:46] all you wanted to in the Old Testament
[48:48] that was no law that they kill you right
[48:50] but you going to do it to kill you right
[48:53] the the difference in the two Jesus come
[48:55] to magnify right Jesus said you know we
[48:58] read there if you if you look on a woman
[49:02] we didn't read it but we you look on a
[49:04] woman to lust after you committed
[49:05] adultery right all right he magnified it
[49:09] right he Amplified it he brought it up
[49:11] into a higher order so Paul then
[49:14] sees now look at the
[49:18] situation I know I'm caral but listen
[49:20] look at the situation of the Apostle
[49:22] Paul in his Old Situation under the law
[49:27] he walk around I'm blameless I'm
[49:30] blameless I haven't sinned all day I'm
[49:34] happy oh I love the Lord Jehovah God he
[49:38] get
[49:41] saved and don't you believe he got saved
[49:44] don't you believe he got the new birth
[49:46] then he's going around and saying who
[49:47] can deliver me from this body of
[49:51] sin looks
[49:53] backward right
[49:57] he comes from a happy state to a
[49:59] condemned state
[50:02] right that's what amplifying the law
[50:05] does to
[50:07] you amen they wouldn't murder I mean
[50:10] they didn't kill you for lusting in the
[50:12] Old Testament but when Jesus said if you
[50:15] lust after one you committed adultery
[50:16] with her
[50:18] right now to the point I'm trying to get
[50:21] you to
[50:22] see is the Apostle Paul wasn't saying I
[50:26] got to sin so I can't have
[50:29] it no he was saying forgive
[50:32] me for sinning
[50:36] right brother random you see he said
[50:38] every day right he said show me where
[50:41] I'm off the word right so he wasn't
[50:44] disbelieving the word
[50:46] right that could not have been what he
[50:48] was talking
[50:52] about he had to be talking about the
[50:54] little things of Life m amen you know
[50:58] you remember he even showed in the
[50:59] vision about how that they about to turn
[51:02] down to the wall and the things you know
[51:04] and in the vision he was even more he
[51:05] was going to bust that
[51:07] guy and when it come up time to do it
[51:09] the Lord said bypass
[51:12] this you
[51:15] know he knew right quick he wasn't
[51:17] supposed to go out there and get mad at
[51:18] that guy he said what are you doing they
[51:21] said we're going to put a road through
[51:22] here he said there's something in a
[51:24] vision I got to go look you went back
[51:26] looked at Vis and said now I got to go
[51:27] to Arizona I don't know why but I got to
[51:32] go but get what I'm talking about we're
[51:35] all human Mortals so one mortal can't
[51:38] look at the other Mortal and see
[51:40] Perfection right because we're all
[51:42] seeing what we
[51:44] see
[51:46] right but God doesn't look at us like
[51:49] that amen the soul is eternal by the new
[51:52] birth
[51:57] how much more perfect can you make
[51:58] anything than Eternal amen right do you
[52:02] have anything to add to Eternity to make
[52:03] it better I'd like to know about
[52:06] it but I thought Eternal
[52:09] was a state of total
[52:14] Perfection that nothing could ever be
[52:16] added to it right you can't make it
[52:19] better you can't do
[52:21] anything cuz it's
[52:23] perfect all right amen but we as human
[52:27] Mortals have problems in their flesh
[52:30] right
[52:34] right just little bitty
[52:38] things but now watch the scripture it's
[52:41] the little
[52:43] foxes right that spoils the
[52:47] vine right
[52:49] right all
[52:51] right
[52:53] now so we're all I'm talking about
[52:57] newborn people now I'm talking about New
[52:58] Birth that's all I can talk about
[52:59] tonight cuz those that are not born
[53:01] again can't understand what you're
[53:02] talking
[53:05] about see that's why you have people you
[53:08] think you're
[53:09] perfect well there's none good know not
[53:14] one I said but God said I
[53:17] perfect I saw you get upset one
[53:21] ago you ain't
[53:23] perfect you're like joob
[53:26] you're a secret
[53:28] sinner well you might have a good
[53:31] argument if job had been proved to being
[53:33] a secret sin that's right right but he
[53:38] wasn't proved to be a secret sinner
[53:40] that's right agreed right go read your
[53:43] book he wasn't proved that he was a
[53:45] secret sinner the only thing that was
[53:48] brother random even just had to State it
[53:49] because elu when he came to him which
[53:52] was Christ he said you're just a little
[53:54] bit exalted
[53:56] M he was a little bit
[53:59] self-righteous
[54:01] right you know why cuz he thought he's
[54:04] right right but he thought he was right
[54:07] in
[54:08] himself right but when he saw that
[54:11] Redeemer amen he knew there was
[54:14] something else to the story and that's
[54:17] the way it is with you and I right see
[54:20] the new birth brings us a redeemer right
[54:24] makes a soul perfect
[54:28] not complete because that's the word
[54:32] Perfection it's a growth development
[54:34] until we leave here stature of a perfect
[54:37] man whatever you want to call it adding
[54:39] Faith you know therefore leaving the
[54:41] principle of the doctrine Christ let's
[54:42] go into Perfection
[54:45] yeah I don't claim to be perfect in the
[54:49] form of being
[54:52] complete well because I'm not complete
[54:54] what about you we're still here
[54:57] anybody got an argument there we're
[54:59] still sitting here we're getting older
[55:02] we're having problems we're start down
[55:04] the road tonight somebody cut us on what
[55:06] did he do that
[55:09] for he might have cut you off on that
[55:11] part to keep you running into that other
[55:13] guy on the other side of the road but
[55:14] see we don't see it like that do
[55:17] we we just see what he do that to me
[55:22] for like brother Mo used to say he said
[55:24] Devil's mad at me he said
[55:27] I ain't making no joke out of it but
[55:28] it's kind of funny he say devil was mad
[55:30] at me he said my water pipes are busting
[55:32] I said no they ain't brother things
[55:33] getting old wor out like
[55:37] you you know you say well the devil was
[55:40] they a lot of water pip last 50 years
[55:42] but you know I'm just making a point
[55:45] that we look at something and think it's
[55:47] maybe uh I remember one time we were
[55:50] coming from Florida and we miscued the
[55:52] way we're to come around Atlanta and
[55:53] after we got so far my wife said what
[55:55] you going to do I said I'm G to let them
[55:57] go on I'm cutting this way
[56:00] well they went all the way around we
[56:02] went
[56:03] through we got down and got a traffic
[56:08] jam we was late getting
[56:10] home
[56:12] but what if I went the other way and it
[56:14] have been a wreck yeah you don't have
[56:16] think like that do
[56:18] you right maybe sometimes the Lord's
[56:21] taking us through things let's get the
[56:22] point to you but
[56:24] listen so then we EST
[56:28] Lish that's why I said I just wanted to
[56:30] make sure you understand then let's
[56:33] establish one
[56:35] thing that by the new
[56:38] birth it makes our soul Eternal right
[56:43] and and if it's Eternal it would have to
[56:45] be perfect
[56:47] right right all right but we're still in
[56:51] human
[56:54] flesh that we have problems every day
[56:57] right right and the Bible says that
[57:00] anything that's not of faith is
[57:05] sin all right I'm an example of it you
[57:09] eat too much your belly sinfully slides
[57:14] out
[57:15] right and the older I get it's the
[57:18] harder to get it back up where it used
[57:19] to be it used to be up under my chest
[57:21] and I had a big old chest but it doesn't
[57:23] work now all
[57:26] eating too
[57:28] much can be a
[57:30] sin how many of you got high blood
[57:34] pressure I love pork don't
[57:36] you now no better need it like
[57:39] everything so I
[57:42] don't I'll eat some he said well it can
[57:46] be Sanctified you know all right but the
[57:49] same one it said you can sanctify it
[57:51] said just leave that stuff alone you
[57:53] know right we already to think about it
[57:56] but I'm just making a point to you when
[57:59] I'm talking about that we sin as human
[58:02] beings and that we're not perfect in our
[58:04] human
[58:05] flesh I am not talking about that that
[58:08] gives us a right to go out and just live
[58:10] like the
[58:11] devil and then say the devil made me do
[58:14] it I don't agree with that you argue
[58:18] with me about it argue with me I don't
[58:20] agree that the devil makes us do it all
[58:22] the time I think we have a lot to do
[58:24] with it that's right I don't blame him
[58:27] for all the
[58:29] things sure sin in the origal brought it
[58:31] down okay we're all
[58:33] right but if you don't volunteer for
[58:38] it
[58:40] right and we
[58:42] volunteer the Bible said he that sends
[58:44] will life receive the knowledge of the
[58:45] truth th remain is no more
[58:48] sacrifice the prophet said you believe
[58:50] in willfully sin that's
[58:54] right cuz you know better
[58:57] are you
[59:01] lost all right Paul what is
[59:07] it with my inward being he said there in
[59:11] Roman I serve the law of
[59:15] God I'm a Christian I'm born
[59:18] again and before I got to this
[59:22] situation I didn't realize all of these
[59:24] things that I was doing was any problems
[59:27] right that's right but said now they've
[59:29] been
[59:30] magnified right before me until I
[59:34] realize that there's none good no not
[59:40] one there's not anything in US mortal
[59:42] people that's any
[59:44] good it's like I tell all of you you can
[59:46] argue with me all you want to people
[59:48] don't like for me to talk playing you
[59:50] know but you black people you can run
[59:52] your roots to
[59:53] Africa we can't run ours no further back
[59:56] hardly
[59:57] anywhere that's why they call us
[59:59] Caucasian I told you a long time ago
[1:00:01] they order said Co
[1:00:03] concoction cuz that's what we are oh
[1:00:06] don't throw off on me I come from
[1:00:07] England yes so it the DS but that don't
[1:00:10] mean I'm
[1:00:13] right you
[1:00:15] see we get that righteous
[1:00:20] indignation I I don't love you thought
[1:00:22] off on my
[1:00:24] family I ain't thought off on your
[1:00:26] family I'm thr off on
[1:00:28] you that solve the problem get me away
[1:00:31] from your family I'm talking about you
[1:00:33] I'm talking about
[1:00:34] me we're in human
[1:00:36] life we live in human life we are
[1:00:39] subject to the things of human life even
[1:00:42] the Lord Jesus was subject to life right
[1:00:46] he had to eat he had to sleep he had to
[1:00:48] do
[1:00:51] things back when I was in the Baptist I
[1:00:54] used to think it was so much God he
[1:00:55] didn't never he couldn't stomp his
[1:00:57] toe I give you scripture B said you bur
[1:01:01] him up unless you dash his foot against
[1:01:02] the tone i' give you scripture
[1:01:07] for when the prophet said after he
[1:01:09] raised that uh child from name there
[1:01:12] believe was from the dead said according
[1:01:14] to I think word comes from but he
[1:01:18] said according to that he said Jesus sat
[1:01:20] on a rock grown with a headache that's
[1:01:22] right
[1:01:27] but you
[1:01:28] see I'm not like these people now that
[1:01:31] said Jesus was done wrong I didn't say
[1:01:34] that so now don't go the wrong way with
[1:01:36] me
[1:01:37] amen he was God in human
[1:01:40] flesh but yet he was a mortal right
[1:01:44] which mean he was subject to life
[1:01:48] right he got angry one day right you
[1:01:53] agree planted a rope together planned it
[1:01:56] in other words didn't just reach over
[1:01:58] and get a whip he platted the ropes
[1:02:00] together he got on I'm going to go out
[1:02:01] there and run them out of his
[1:02:03] P you know that's what he done that's
[1:02:06] right but like I've always tried to tell
[1:02:08] you we might run somebody out out of the
[1:02:10] building but are we willing to go to the
[1:02:11] cross and die for them that's it
[1:02:14] it that's my point right sinless
[1:02:18] Perfection there's no such
[1:02:22] thing there's no such thing as sinless
[1:02:24] Perfection now watch my point in the New
[1:02:28] Birth by the new birth in your soul is
[1:02:31] sinless perfection amen you see what I'm
[1:02:34] talking about in your new birth is
[1:02:36] sinless
[1:02:38] perfection but there mortal beings out
[1:02:41] here in this life that we
[1:02:43] live the best we could
[1:02:46] do would never be sinless Perfection
[1:02:49] right that's
[1:02:50] right he say yes no it's not sinless
[1:02:53] Perfection it's
[1:02:54] covered I
[1:02:56] don't you know I'll give you a quote a
[1:02:59] minute where brother Brown said it it's
[1:03:03] a not what you've done is not even what
[1:03:05] you
[1:03:12] do so be careful now what you're
[1:03:15] doing but just don't go overboard that's
[1:03:18] the point I want to make to you
[1:03:20] tonight we're talking about eternal life
[1:03:24] in the soul to make the soul Eternal but
[1:03:26] we're talking about human mortal bodies
[1:03:30] that live under the curse of sin amen
[1:03:33] right you wouldn't have babies born if
[1:03:35] you didn't have lust right come
[1:03:40] on you understand what I'm
[1:03:43] saying so we're living in a
[1:03:47] situation to where that we need
[1:03:51] something to work on his body right am
[1:03:55] that's why I've always tried to get you
[1:03:56] to see that brother Brown's message come
[1:03:58] to explain eternal life for Body Spirit
[1:04:02] Soul world everything
[1:04:06] amen we didn't need a message of eternal
[1:04:09] life for the soul the Bible is already
[1:04:10] full of it with the apostles amen but we
[1:04:13] needed somebody to turn us back to help
[1:04:15] us to see that amen
[1:04:17] right but everybody was looking for a
[1:04:20] new
[1:04:22] body you see the reason they was looking
[1:04:24] for a new body
[1:04:27] they were honest enough to admit that
[1:04:28] this body is not no
[1:04:31] good
[1:04:33] right but see the people of the message
[1:04:36] gets the
[1:04:37] idea
[1:04:39] that well bless God I don't see him
[1:04:42] anyway what are you doing it
[1:04:47] for like I told you about that lady told
[1:04:49] Jack Co had SE in that many years or
[1:04:51] something he said let sit down and shut
[1:04:53] up you're the biggest liar here
[1:04:56] well it's time to say things like
[1:04:58] that people say so I tell you what I
[1:05:01] always was eternal you can't condemn me
[1:05:04] that's why they go off and have extra
[1:05:06] women and young girls and all kind of
[1:05:08] things in this
[1:05:09] message that I don't like to be
[1:05:11] associated with it amen but we
[1:05:16] are because of
[1:05:19] life but there's plenty of them that
[1:05:21] that take out these little young girls
[1:05:23] and live with them
[1:05:26] cuz they preached that they're their
[1:05:28] husband and they're doing no more the
[1:05:30] Catholic church was what they was doing
[1:05:32] right claiming the message claiming
[1:05:35] brother Rand said it was all
[1:05:38] right and being that's the biggest
[1:05:40] hypocrite in the world right they have
[1:05:43] their day they ain't worried about it
[1:05:45] amen but I'm just trying to
[1:05:48] express in human
[1:05:52] terminologies that in Soul you can be
[1:05:54] perfectly Tau totally
[1:05:56] sinless but living in a body that's
[1:05:59] subject to the
[1:06:02] world that told you over and over I say
[1:06:04] it one more time that don't give us no
[1:06:07] right to go out and say it don't matter
[1:06:09] what I do I'm going to
[1:06:13] heaven you got that idea you're not even
[1:06:15] born
[1:06:17] again is that plain
[1:06:20] enough bless God I you didn't say I know
[1:06:22] I didn't say you but I like what the man
[1:06:25] said about you know one of the great
[1:06:27] evangelists down to there and this old
[1:06:29] drunk was staggering by and this other
[1:06:30] evangelist talk to him said that's one
[1:06:32] of your converts he said looks like
[1:06:34] something i'
[1:06:38] convert he sure didn't say it was God's
[1:06:40] convert right but when we living like
[1:06:45] that you see Church don't ever get to
[1:06:47] the point that we think that it doesn't
[1:06:49] matter what we do in these bodies cuz it
[1:06:52] does
[1:06:53] matter that's where I've tried to
[1:06:55] explain to you there are two judgments
[1:06:57] in the Bible one is the white Throne
[1:07:02] judgment we do not go before that white
[1:07:04] Throne judgment we sit on the white
[1:07:06] Throne judgment with him judging the
[1:07:08] world and even judging Angels etc etc
[1:07:11] but there is a judgment of the Deeds
[1:07:13] Done in the body whether good or bad and
[1:07:15] if we don't get rid of them while we're
[1:07:20] here we're going to have to answer that
[1:07:23] right right and you said well bless joh
[1:07:26] I just wait till I get there you know
[1:07:28] what that proves you
[1:07:32] lost show me where the holy spirit
[1:07:35] inside of you could allow you to go out
[1:07:36] and live in adultery and not condemn you
[1:07:40] well it don't condemn me to smoke
[1:07:44] well you don't have anything to
[1:07:48] condemn you don't condemn me to drink
[1:07:50] you don't condemn me to do it when you
[1:07:51] don't have anything to
[1:07:53] condemn a hog acts like a hog
[1:07:57] right that's his
[1:07:59] nature but you take the nature out of
[1:08:02] the
[1:08:02] hog and you put a nature of a lamb in
[1:08:05] the hog what have you
[1:08:06] got he's going to act like a lamb we're
[1:08:10] supposed to be
[1:08:11] Christians
[1:08:14] right think people with enough temper to
[1:08:16] fight a bu all they say I'm a
[1:08:19] Christian I'm
[1:08:21] Christian
[1:08:23] well I can two brothers were saying that
[1:08:25] night in a Minister's meeting was having
[1:08:28] they was talking about how that that you
[1:08:30] know said you know it's it's it's not me
[1:08:34] mad said it's just my right indignation
[1:08:37] you know this other brother got up
[1:08:38] behind him and said I don't know how
[1:08:40] y'all feel about it but said when I act
[1:08:41] like that I'm
[1:08:44] mad you know and that's what we ought to
[1:08:47] do is face ourselves right you know when
[1:08:52] you look in the
[1:08:53] mirror there's been more muscles strin
[1:08:55] looking in mirrors than they have about
[1:08:58] weightlifting right you stand there
[1:09:03] and boy you look pretty you don't see
[1:09:06] all them wrinkles all that gray ha all
[1:09:09] that bald head old fat tummy hanging
[1:09:14] out we think we're
[1:09:17] pretty
[1:09:19] right what you pring for a boy that's
[1:09:21] what you do every morning you get up
[1:09:26] we think we're
[1:09:28] pretty you
[1:09:30] know but listen
[1:09:33] Church defining
[1:09:36] words is what I'm trying to
[1:09:39] do when the prophet said I sin
[1:09:43] daily I don't believe he was saying I
[1:09:45] disbelieve the
[1:09:47] word but yet he will finalize sin by
[1:09:50] saying there's just one sin right and
[1:09:53] that's the sin of unbelief
[1:09:58] but see Life Is Life we live in life we
[1:10:01] we are here we're under the
[1:10:04] curse and until the change comes we will
[1:10:08] have trouble with these bodies right
[1:10:13] right see if you ever get to Point
[1:10:15] thinking in your mind well it don't
[1:10:17] matter what I
[1:10:20] do you already to know that ain't God
[1:10:28] that's not God telling you it's all
[1:10:30] right to do those things right amen
[1:10:34] right when I got B with that that's what
[1:10:37] he
[1:10:38] thought that's right God was right he
[1:10:40] said today you eat she died less than a
[1:10:42] th Years cuz one day is a th000 years
[1:10:44] she died less than a th years God was
[1:10:47] still right but she didn't think it she
[1:10:49] thought she got B
[1:10:51] ined she lived 900 something years
[1:10:56] she thought she got by with it but God's
[1:10:59] word was still right
[1:11:00] am see we still is I trying to explain
[1:11:03] the other day we still have to have the
[1:11:06] Bible says an
[1:11:09] advocate Paul says which is one who
[1:11:12] stands
[1:11:15] between bless God I'm so perfect I don't
[1:11:17] need nobody stand between me and God I
[1:11:19] stand
[1:11:22] myself I'll remind you who was it
[1:11:26] that that had the dream or whatever it
[1:11:28] was I think his name in a minute and he
[1:11:30] he went to heaven and he
[1:11:34] said while he was there in the presence
[1:11:36] of that light he thought I never have
[1:11:39] done wrong I never Li he said then all
[1:11:42] these little things came up to where it
[1:11:44] wasn't exactly right right I never stole
[1:11:47] anything he said all these things came
[1:11:49] up that wasn't exactly
[1:11:53] right well brother D I mean I've had
[1:11:56] people argue me with
[1:11:58] this they said will the Lord forgive
[1:12:04] me see one brother tried to preach here
[1:12:06] and I told him it wouldn't right some
[1:12:07] pull pip here he tried to preach did you
[1:12:09] get the new birth that covered you
[1:12:11] marriage and divorce I told him I didn't
[1:12:12] agree with that cuz one would WR around
[1:12:15] have to preach the grace of
[1:12:19] it you said well now maybe he meant all
[1:12:22] right maybe he meant I don't know but he
[1:12:23] sure didn't explain it that's
[1:12:28] right maybe he meant the completion of
[1:12:30] the new birth would set everything free
[1:12:32] that's right but we can have the new
[1:12:34] birth and we need the grace of marriage
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:36] divorce amen yes
[1:12:39] sir CU you can't accept the grace of
[1:12:41] marriage and divorce unless you got the
[1:12:43] new birth first right that's right tell
[1:12:46] me how you can do
[1:12:48] it the prophet said it's a supernatural
[1:12:51] Revelation because of the opening of The
[1:12:53] Seven Seals right
[1:12:58] I was looking at another scripture in
[1:12:59] there tonight and you know there some
[1:13:01] things I'll probably speak on that
[1:13:03] Oklahoma but I remembered this scripture
[1:13:05] but I didn't bring it out
[1:13:09] when when I was in the point of talking
[1:13:11] about Moses in Exodus
[1:13:14] 32 but in
[1:13:16] numbers uh
[1:13:20] 14 verse 19 Moses said pardon I beseech
[1:13:24] Thee the iniquity of this people
[1:13:26] according unto the greatness of thy
[1:13:27] mercy as thou H has forgiven this people
[1:13:31] from Egypt until e even until now and
[1:13:35] the Lord said I have pardoned according
[1:13:38] to Thy
[1:13:43] word that was Christ not
[1:13:47] Moses Christ that tell could tell God a
[1:13:50] better way of doing something Moses
[1:13:52] never gloried in the fact that he
[1:13:53] thought he wasn't guilty Abraham didn't
[1:13:55] need you
[1:13:58] right if you're a human mortal with the
[1:14:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost take my word
[1:14:03] for it you'll never you you'll never get
[1:14:05] to the basis that you don't realize
[1:14:07] what's wrong in your life right if you
[1:14:09] ever think you do number one you need an
[1:14:12] order right cuz you're not born again
[1:14:15] right that's what Paul's explaining the
[1:14:19] things I do I would not the things I do
[1:14:21] would not I do and all but it's not me
[1:14:25] it's this law sin of My
[1:14:29] Flesh but the inward
[1:14:32] man is pure by the new
[1:14:37] birth does everybody understand what I'm
[1:14:39] saying whether you agree with me or not
[1:14:41] right that's up to you between God and
[1:14:42] you to reveal it I believe that every
[1:14:45] person that is ever born again is
[1:14:47] absolutely totally sinless in their soul
[1:14:50] right right if you're born again amen
[1:14:55] but this body is still the problem we
[1:14:57] got troubles with yes
[1:14:59] sir right and as long as we're in this
[1:15:02] body we will have troubles with the body
[1:15:04] that's
[1:15:05] right but I am not talking about not
[1:15:09] talking about well I can't help it so I
[1:15:11] commit adultery every once in a while
[1:15:13] you're not born again that's right do
[1:15:15] you understand me any planer can I get
[1:15:19] right what else can I say that's
[1:15:26] I don't mean it's wrong but can I put it
[1:15:27] in a Northern language and say you're
[1:15:30] wrong or a southern language say you
[1:15:35] wrong he regardless it comes out to one
[1:15:39] thing the prophet of God said a
[1:15:42] Christian will
[1:15:44] immediately amen when you do wrong
[1:15:47] repent that's
[1:15:49] right yes sir you mean to tell me you
[1:15:52] can go out and do something wrong and
[1:15:54] and go to pick up your Bible and start
[1:15:56] to read it and like I said even brother
[1:16:00] brandom right when that income tax case
[1:16:03] wasn't he was just so wore out until
[1:16:05] humanly mortally he was just wanting to
[1:16:07] get rid of the guys he told his wife he
[1:16:10] started out the door said tell him I'm
[1:16:11] not here you know he wasn't in the
[1:16:14] house but it was a white lie and the
[1:16:17] white Li is worse than the big lie big
[1:16:20] lie nobody don't believe white lie some
[1:16:23] people believe right
[1:16:26] when he said tell them I'm not here he
[1:16:28] goes down to pray for a baby right the
[1:16:31] holy spirit said take your dirty hands
[1:16:33] off that
[1:16:36] baby of course most of us would have
[1:16:38] said bless God lord I pray I'm sorry I
[1:16:41] repented to
[1:16:42] you he said you going to make it
[1:16:46] right that's right he didn't just go
[1:16:49] back and tell his
[1:16:50] wife he did but he didn't stop there he
[1:16:55] them people
[1:16:56] up and he explained it to them I was
[1:16:59] just so wor out I didn't want to talk to
[1:17:01] you said I'm sorry I lied to you and I
[1:17:05] had my wife to
[1:17:08] lie you know what the man said I than
[1:17:10] more of you now it never
[1:17:12] have you think things it turned out good
[1:17:15] but then he went back to that baby and
[1:17:17] he said now bring me the
[1:17:18] baby and God delivered the child right
[1:17:23] there you see we don't think about that
[1:17:26] that we you know we think we get by with
[1:17:28] it because we do something wrong and
[1:17:30] like I've always told you and you tell
[1:17:33] me I'm wrong come on be in my office
[1:17:34] right well you know what it is I go do
[1:17:37] something to
[1:17:40] somebody I go to Dan I do something to
[1:17:44] Danny you know if I don't get rid of
[1:17:47] that immediately when that Holy Spirit
[1:17:48] condemns me tells me I'm wrong you know
[1:17:51] what'll happen cuz you're a human being
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:55] about an hour later I start blaming him
[1:17:58] for it right right it wasn't my fault he
[1:18:01] would not even been here if he had been
[1:18:04] here I wouldn't have said
[1:18:06] that two hours later first thing you
[1:18:08] know I blamed him for
[1:18:11] everything it's all Danny's
[1:18:14] fault well you know that's going to have
[1:18:16] to be straightened up
[1:18:18] somewhere but I don't understand
[1:18:21] you I don't understand you Brother D you
[1:18:24] preached it we're
[1:18:25] perfect and then you preach that we got
[1:18:28] things we need to
[1:18:30] confess I'm just telling you what the
[1:18:32] Bible says and telling you what the
[1:18:34] prophet
[1:18:36] said if I'm that far off come and show
[1:18:42] me but don't come into office with me
[1:18:44] and start sitting down I don't agree
[1:18:45] with you you bring your Bible and you
[1:18:47] bring the prophet's message we'll talk
[1:18:50] about it I don't have time to play
[1:18:52] around with silly little ideas I just
[1:18:54] don't think you're right I think he was
[1:18:56] upset well if I'm upset that's my
[1:19:01] problem I have to deal with
[1:19:04] that I have to go home tonight and live
[1:19:06] with this
[1:19:09] sermon it hits me for it hits
[1:19:16] you but there's people that rather to
[1:19:18] give you brand new Cadillac and say I'm
[1:19:20] sorry
[1:19:25] right that's
[1:19:26] right right why I can't what you say I'm
[1:19:29] sorry yes
[1:19:31] sir but really mean
[1:19:35] it the prophet said that Holy Spirit
[1:19:37] Will condemn you immediately get rid of
[1:19:41] it when the Bible said don't let your
[1:19:43] sin go down on sun go down on your wrath
[1:19:46] right then the next day you going to
[1:19:48] blame the other
[1:19:51] person don't let it go down I'm sorry
[1:19:53] that's right that's why I said the
[1:19:55] wedding I do it it wouldn't matter to me
[1:19:58] if I was as mad as a hornet my wife
[1:20:01] before we go to bed tonight I said love
[1:20:03] you and I mean
[1:20:12] it I mean it I'm sorry I love you I
[1:20:17] apologize what I love
[1:20:20] you but why can't we be that way it is
[1:20:25] bless God let her say it first then I'll
[1:20:27] say it now where's the Bible for
[1:20:33] it just onest where's the Bible
[1:20:38] for
[1:20:40] listen according to the Bible and
[1:20:42] according to the prophet we're human
[1:20:45] beings and we're going to have trouble
[1:20:47] in this
[1:20:49] flesh right all
[1:20:51] right sometimes we can't help because
[1:20:54] because we're
[1:20:56] human because of our
[1:20:59] life desires things husband wife living
[1:21:02] that's that's God it doesn't look at
[1:21:04] that to call it
[1:21:07] sin it's going to do with the wrong
[1:21:10] person
[1:21:11] then you got a problem
[1:21:15] right see I'm not talking about
[1:21:17] something to where that it doesn't
[1:21:18] matter what we
[1:21:21] do because if we don't confess
[1:21:25] they will have to be an account given
[1:21:27] for that act that we done right right
[1:21:31] well I I thought you meant we' all go it
[1:21:33] doesn't have anything to do with going
[1:21:35] to
[1:21:37] heaven you'll already be in heaven or
[1:21:39] somewhere when that
[1:21:45] appears it's not going to keep us out of
[1:21:47] the
[1:21:48] Rapture but we have to give an
[1:21:51] account I tell you one I don't know
[1:21:53] where I believe that or
[1:21:56] not that's your
[1:21:59] choice I thought when I got saved that
[1:22:02] everything was
[1:22:03] covered that's as Catholic as anybody
[1:22:06] can be
[1:22:07] right I'm not against them
[1:22:10] right I just use that because that's
[1:22:12] what they do so we Baptist you know what
[1:22:15] we
[1:22:16] have once saved always
[1:22:22] sa you never heard him preach F was
[1:22:25] going to heaven because he pav the
[1:22:26] parking
[1:22:27] lot painted the church putting new pews
[1:22:30] in don't anybody go to hell no
[1:22:33] more you want to do away with
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:39] yeah but I'm just trying to be honest
[1:22:43] straight where you won't misunderstand
[1:22:45] me then when I do say look there is a
[1:22:48] man
[1:22:50] somewhere that the Bible said sin is not
[1:22:55] imputed unto that man
[1:22:59] right and you know anything I put under
[1:23:01] the
[1:23:03] blood right can't be imputed
[1:23:10] that's but if I don't put it under the
[1:23:16] blood somewhere I'm going to
[1:23:20] ask that's hard to understand I guess
[1:23:22] the people that are not regenerated
[1:23:25] right because he can't understand how
[1:23:26] you can preach
[1:23:28] Perfection and then preach that you've
[1:23:30] got to answer for the Deeds Done in the
[1:23:32] body I didn't write the
[1:23:38] Bible I just try to tell you what God
[1:23:43] says why wouldn't we want to be
[1:23:48] straight why would we want to go out and
[1:23:50] live like the
[1:23:51] devil and think that we could go to
[1:23:53] heaven
[1:23:56] brother randman explaining that he said
[1:23:58] say suppose I go overseas he said some
[1:24:00] woman comes
[1:24:03] along you know what he's talking about
[1:24:05] right we mortal a human being some woman
[1:24:08] comes along you know speaks to him wrong
[1:24:09] way so he comes home he said I go tell
[1:24:12] my wife said honey this woman come up he
[1:24:15] said I believe she'd forgive
[1:24:19] me but he said how dare could I do that
[1:24:24] right when she's sitting at home turned
[1:24:26] gray-headed at 40 years old handling the
[1:24:30] fires and life and burdened with all
[1:24:32] kind of things what you what do you
[1:24:34] women think it would be like living
[1:24:35] there whenever day you had maniacs and
[1:24:38] all kind of things hanging on your doors
[1:24:40] and and all kind of people coming out
[1:24:41] and you couldn't even have a minute with
[1:24:43] your husband because he's got to be gone
[1:24:45] somewhere to pray for
[1:24:49] somebody he said I dare that I could do
[1:24:52] something like that
[1:24:54] he said I wouldn't because I love
[1:24:58] her we're not talking about a doo
[1:25:03] granddaddy you know how that is our
[1:25:06] grandkids they get by with bloody
[1:25:08] murder when great grandkids coming along
[1:25:10] doing just the
[1:25:12] same kids come in and say you didn't let
[1:25:14] us do
[1:25:16] that we jumped on the bed we got we
[1:25:20] didn't want to sit down for a while
[1:25:22] that's right yeah you know
[1:25:26] we it's different
[1:25:29] now yes sir God's not to do your
[1:25:36] grandaddy he's
[1:25:39] gone he knows how to raise his children
[1:25:42] amen that's right and you know what he
[1:25:45] does a lot of times he gives us a weapon
[1:25:47] when we need
[1:25:49] it that's right you know but you know
[1:25:52] what I love about him he always whips
[1:25:55] with a nail scarred hand that's
[1:25:57] right
[1:26:03] right see Scofield even knew when it
[1:26:06] says there be therefore perfect even as
[1:26:09] your father in Heaven is perfect he says
[1:26:11] in his footnotes he said it has nothing
[1:26:13] to do with the fact of
[1:26:19] sin he said there's a growth development
[1:26:22] that's right
[1:26:25] the growth
[1:26:29] development and we get the older we get
[1:26:31] in the Christianity you mean to think
[1:26:33] that we can say we can get
[1:26:40] by you know
[1:26:43] what I I hate two things and I'm sorry
[1:26:46] I'm just human I don't mind telling you
[1:26:48] I don't like to go to
[1:26:49] funerals and I don't like to go to
[1:26:51] hospitals
[1:26:55] I do I'm just
[1:26:57] sorry maybe that's why I don't go a lot
[1:26:59] I went this morning to see brother
[1:27:01] George for a few minut I had a good time
[1:27:02] with him his mind still good working
[1:27:04] good and all they working on him you
[1:27:06] know he said what in the world am I
[1:27:07] doing here brother Dale I said well
[1:27:09] maybe it's CA they need to give you some
[1:27:10] therapy well I want him to be happy
[1:27:12] about it you know
[1:27:15] have condemn somebody and say well put
[1:27:17] you in here cuz they going to leave you
[1:27:18] let you
[1:27:19] die why don't you have to be something
[1:27:21] like
[1:27:21] that I said they going to give you
[1:27:23] therapy they were they would happen it
[1:27:26] but you don't hate to be there because I
[1:27:28] see those people with their
[1:27:29] minds but you know what I think
[1:27:34] about I think about that person that his
[1:27:37] mind is slipping you know I don't
[1:27:39] believe God accounts those
[1:27:41] thing I
[1:27:43] know you may believe different I don't
[1:27:45] know I don't believe God accounts those
[1:27:47] things when it comes to a place that
[1:27:49] they don't you
[1:27:51] know and I look around and I just say
[1:27:53] thank you Lord
[1:27:57] that you don't keep up with all this
[1:27:58] that they're doing but you still do all
[1:28:01] the things I'm
[1:28:02] doing forgive
[1:28:05] me forgive
[1:28:07] me how many times a day do you ask God
[1:28:10] to forgive
[1:28:12] you every time I pray I ask him forgive
[1:28:15] me
[1:28:17] Lord you said well you ought to quit
[1:28:18] doing it I
[1:28:21] try but I'm a human mortal
[1:28:26] mhm what would it be what thing could we
[1:28:29] do if God was to drop down right into
[1:28:32] our presence if you go to a King brother
[1:28:35] Brown said I didn't mind it he said they
[1:28:36] cut my trousers off you know and fixed
[1:28:39] them and he said I was told never to to
[1:28:41] turn my back on a king he said I have no
[1:28:45] problem cuz see that was their way of
[1:28:48] doing he said I ain't going to kiss his
[1:28:50] toe or his ring right but he went before
[1:28:54] you know would have went before the Pope
[1:28:56] I think something happened he didn't get
[1:28:57] to go I'm just I'm just saying that off
[1:28:59] hand I can't remember but
[1:29:03] anyhow what would it be if you knew that
[1:29:05] Jesus Christ was going to stand right
[1:29:07] here
[1:29:12] tonight ain't a person in this world be
[1:29:14] able to stand in his principles
[1:29:20] right cuz we'd be condemned
[1:29:25] but every soul of ever born again
[1:29:27] Christian can stand in his
[1:29:31] presence so until I can get to that
[1:29:34] place to bring this body to the
[1:29:36] position let me depend upon the inward
[1:29:39] part and you know what the only way the
[1:29:41] outward part is going to ever be worth
[1:29:43] anything is because of the inward
[1:29:46] part I'm glad he's not looking at me
[1:29:51] amen are you listening I don't need an
[1:29:55] atonement for my soul if my soul is
[1:29:57] eternal right right The Advocate is not
[1:30:01] for your soul if your soul is
[1:30:05] eternal the Redeemer is not for your
[1:30:07] soul if your soul is
[1:30:11] eternal it is for the rest of
[1:30:13] us body and spirit
[1:30:19] amen I agree with one brother years ago
[1:30:21] he said your brain is the first thing
[1:30:22] that needed to be baptized
[1:30:24] and I agree with
[1:30:26] that that's right we need a baptism of
[1:30:29] the Holy Ghost on the
[1:30:30] brain you know cleans it up and
[1:30:33] straighten it
[1:30:34] up but does everybody understand that's
[1:30:36] all all I want to make is one
[1:30:38] point the soul is perfectly totally
[1:30:41] sinless so when the prophet is said to
[1:30:43] bride is perfectly stand before God
[1:30:45] perfectly totally
[1:30:46] sinless he's talking about the soul of
[1:30:49] the
[1:30:50] individual but the body is still under
[1:30:53] an advocate
[1:31:00] but as the Old Testament
[1:31:04] person that sin that they committed
[1:31:07] under the atonement
[1:31:10] was covered but when Jesus Christ came
[1:31:14] he eradicated
[1:31:20] it he died once for all he eradicated
[1:31:23] sin
[1:31:27] then with our bodies and Spirits we're
[1:31:29] still of the
[1:31:31] world and human
[1:31:33] Mortals that are subject to doing
[1:31:38] wrong but that don't
[1:31:41] justify that's right you don't say well
[1:31:45] well I just can't Happ it no man you're
[1:31:48] lying right you said I can't help it I
[1:31:51] can't help lust and I can't help this
[1:31:52] you're lying I can't help seeing what's
[1:31:54] out there I agreee with you on that cuz
[1:31:57] but everywhere you turn there's plenty
[1:31:58] of them
[1:32:00] now you can't help seeing but you can
[1:32:02] help lust
[1:32:05] them and you know the greatest thing
[1:32:07] that's always helped me to be one thing
[1:32:10] a sister told me one time said brother
[1:32:11] Dale don't look you over when he's
[1:32:13] walking up to you he said he looks in
[1:32:14] your
[1:32:16] eyes I don't have problems as a human
[1:32:18] mortal I've never tried to express
[1:32:20] Perfection that I live this life of this
[1:32:23] no I'm a human
[1:32:27] mortal but you
[1:32:29] know I try to look at every woman as my
[1:32:31] sister that's right in the
[1:32:38] Lord you understand that in the
[1:32:43] Lord I'm a human
[1:32:49] mortal BL
[1:32:55] but I know how to handle that
[1:32:58] thing just say forgive me is a good way
[1:33:01] of do it
[1:33:02] it and don't tell me women that you
[1:33:05] don't have your thoughts and and all
[1:33:07] I've done been too
[1:33:10] old the women's bathroom is nastier than
[1:33:12] the men if you want to be
[1:33:15] playing that's right we're not living in
[1:33:17] the old days of where women was counted
[1:33:20] to be something different they have
[1:33:21] their thinking ability remember it was
[1:33:24] the woman that had the thoughts wrong to
[1:33:26] start with that caused all of this
[1:33:28] problem that's
[1:33:31] right but you see I'm just trying to be
[1:33:36] honest have you asked God today to
[1:33:39] forgive
[1:33:42] you well let me think back over s now if
[1:33:45] you got to think it over you got a
[1:33:47] problem if you got to think over what
[1:33:49] you've done today to see whether or not
[1:33:51] you need to repent you got a problem
[1:33:54] that's right I just say Lord forgive me
[1:33:57] for being a human
[1:33:59] sir and you know I wish sometimes that
[1:34:04] doctrines would have been
[1:34:06] different you see you're crazy I know it
[1:34:08] but I just tell you like I
[1:34:10] think it'd be nice for us just get a new
[1:34:13] body if we didn't have no problems with
[1:34:14] this
[1:34:16] one but it don't work
[1:34:20] amen but this body can be redeemed amen
[1:34:24] yes sir Paul wouldn't saying I can't
[1:34:26] help it living like the devil but he
[1:34:28] said with my body I serve the law of
[1:34:35] sin I'm a human
[1:34:37] mortal living in
[1:34:40] life and have problems in
[1:34:46] life but he said I thank God that inward
[1:34:49] man is after the the law of the spirit
[1:34:53] right
[1:34:56] then he could say in Romans 8:1 there is
[1:34:58] therefore now no
[1:35:00] condemnation and watch
[1:35:04] you to those that are in Christ
[1:35:08] Jesus
[1:35:10] Paul do you mean
[1:35:13] that it's blessed to be in Christ Jesus
[1:35:16] and we know how to repent so we stopped
[1:35:19] that's where I got in trouble years ago
[1:35:20] trying to preach a little message called
[1:35:22] interpolating cuz inter ating simply
[1:35:24] means that you're bringing down from one
[1:35:26] language to another or thought to
[1:35:27] correct what you're thinking to not
[1:35:29] leave loopholes when you speak in
[1:35:32] Spanish and you say we say we're going
[1:35:34] to town in Spanish they say to town we
[1:35:36] go even if you translated the words
[1:35:38] exact it's entirely different you're
[1:35:42] interpolating and Scofield says that
[1:35:44] Paul interpolated the next part of that
[1:35:47] verse Romans 8:1 he said therefore there
[1:35:50] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:35:52] that are in Christ Jesus
[1:35:56] the holy spirit said Paul you left the
[1:35:58] loophole that people will come along to
[1:36:01] think they can live like the devil and
[1:36:02] get by with it as long as they claim
[1:36:04] they're in Christ
[1:36:06] Jesus so you know what he said to those
[1:36:09] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:36:12] the spirit
[1:36:14] right I Die daily he said
[1:36:20] right you ever heard it preached on
[1:36:22] justification and sanctification the
[1:36:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost in three
[1:36:27] stages of each
[1:36:30] one the disciples were Sanctified
[1:36:35] right and then they got the new birth
[1:36:38] you know that Paul taught a daily
[1:36:42] sanctification that's
[1:36:44] right that's what he's doing he's
[1:36:46] teaching the daily
[1:36:48] sanctification a daily repenting and
[1:36:51] cleansing and setting aside
[1:36:59] that's why all those scriptures are
[1:37:01] there to keep us from going the wrong
[1:37:07] way sinless Perfection there's no need
[1:37:09] of talking about
[1:37:11] it but what about what a prophet would
[1:37:14] say we don't have time to get them off
[1:37:16] and read them because we're running
[1:37:19] out he had to die for all of us
[1:37:24] he had to Die the perfect
[1:37:26] one that we imperfect could be made
[1:37:29] perfect in him by partaking of every
[1:37:32] word of his
[1:37:36] Bible perfect blood perfect atonement
[1:37:39] perfect
[1:37:41] loosing there is therefore now no
[1:37:46] condemnation his death gave us the blood
[1:37:49] the blood has loosed us there's no
[1:37:52] condemnation how can there there is
[1:37:54] nothing to be condemned for because the
[1:37:56] blood has loosed us from sin we are free
[1:37:59] Guiltless don't listen to man listen to
[1:38:02] the word we are Loos by the
[1:38:05] blood you so when nobody can be
[1:38:09] perfect the Bible says there is none
[1:38:12] perfect he said there's your
[1:38:15] contradiction cuz you're taking that
[1:38:17] scripture and then the other scripture
[1:38:20] says that in Jesus Christ you're perfect
[1:38:29] the law having a shadow of things to
[1:38:31] come could not make the comary to
[1:38:34] perfect what's the subject Paul's
[1:38:36] speaking of here Perfection God requires
[1:38:39] Perfection no one could ever come to
[1:38:43] Heaven outside of being
[1:38:45] perfect perfect you must be perfect and
[1:38:49] yet the scripture says None is
[1:38:51] perfect so if you must be perfect to
[1:38:54] come to heaven then and the scripture
[1:38:57] says not is perfect and we're all and
[1:39:00] we're we've all sin and come short of
[1:39:03] the glory of God how are we going to
[1:39:06] enter God's living
[1:39:08] place and Dwelling Place when he
[1:39:10] requires Perfection Jesus said I Believe
[1:39:13] In The Sermon on the Mount be therefore
[1:39:15] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:39:17] perfect think of perfection that's what
[1:39:19] God requires of the person of perfection
[1:39:25] amen the Bible said he that is born of
[1:39:28] God does not commit sin for he cannot
[1:39:30] sin how can you make a man a sinner when
[1:39:32] the blood bleach of the blood of Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ is between him and God that would
[1:39:37] scatter sin till there's there are be
[1:39:39] nothing L of it how can that pure blood
[1:39:43] of Christ ever let a man sins pass die
[1:39:47] he says he
[1:39:51] cannot it paid your price it settled a
[1:39:54] question your sins as Scarlet you're as
[1:39:57] white as snow red like Crimson white
[1:40:00] like wool then you have no sin you are
[1:40:02] perfectly sinless no matter what you
[1:40:05] done or what you
[1:40:08] do you're still sinless as long as
[1:40:12] you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:40:19] savior think on these things
[1:40:24] we got to be perfect to go to
[1:40:28] heaven so one day these bodies are going
[1:40:31] to be
[1:40:34] changed they have to be changed to match
[1:40:37] the rest of us you know the Eternal part
[1:40:39] of the Soul so your soul is the only
[1:40:42] thing that's
[1:40:42] Eternal by the new
[1:40:46] birth and now
[1:40:50] listen if you have the new birth
[1:40:55] and you go out and do wrong see now this
[1:40:56] is why the statements going for a while
[1:40:58] are going to be confusing if you don't
[1:41:00] have any birth to
[1:41:04] understand I've explained it over and
[1:41:06] over you sin you the prophet said you
[1:41:09] sin a sin as a Christian he said you
[1:41:11] reap a tug for so what do you do
[1:41:13] immediately home do it you say forgive
[1:41:16] me
[1:41:17] right you know God don't Recon sin to a
[1:41:20] born again believer that's right
[1:41:24] I don't understand that when you just
[1:41:25] got to explain without to give an
[1:41:28] account that don't annihilate that that
[1:41:32] settles
[1:41:33] that why wouldn't you want to give an
[1:41:38] account what would be your reason for
[1:41:40] not wanting to give an account
[1:41:43] that's why they be
[1:41:47] embarrassing you're talking about
[1:41:49] eternal life
[1:41:58] eternal life is a
[1:42:00] person it's not something to play with
[1:42:04] right and if that person's inside of
[1:42:07] you I ask myself all the
[1:42:11] time if Jesus Christ was living in this
[1:42:14] flesh would he be doing
[1:42:18] this you don't ever think like that you
[1:42:21] don't ever talk to yourself
[1:42:28] Jesus Christ wouldn't do
[1:42:36] this so if he's living in my flesh he
[1:42:39] wouldn't do it in my flesh no more than
[1:42:40] he doing it in his
[1:42:46] flesh brother R said he was tempted by
[1:42:51] women to be tempted of sin is not
[1:42:55] sin lust when it's
[1:42:58] conceived stage one 2 three lust when
[1:43:01] it's conceived bringeth forth Sin Sin
[1:43:03] when it's finished bring forth death the
[1:43:04] Bible
[1:43:06] says it's not a sin to be
[1:43:08] tempted
[1:43:11] right is when we yield to the Temptation
[1:43:15] right
[1:43:18] right see Jesus was tempted in all
[1:43:21] points the Bible said like we are
[1:43:24] but yet without
[1:43:28] sin you say how did that happen don't
[1:43:31] ask me I can't explain it you're going
[1:43:32] to have to talk to God I don't I don't
[1:43:35] understand how Jesus being so Eternal as
[1:43:37] he was yet he could be a Satan could
[1:43:39] talk to him I don't understand how up
[1:43:42] there right now Satan can be up there in
[1:43:44] the presence of God talking about me and
[1:43:48] you he made it that way and I guess he
[1:43:50] wanted it that way I don't understand
[1:43:53] that's right he can get an audience with
[1:43:55] God at any time to go talk about you
[1:43:57] Mark and I can't get an audience with
[1:43:59] him to try to cover my sins time
[1:44:02] seemingly I look like he's gone on
[1:44:04] vacation when I'm
[1:44:06] praying you don't ever feel that way
[1:44:09] amen just remember he
[1:44:14] Ain brother rown said when you sin you
[1:44:17] want this quote he said when you sin
[1:44:19] said immediately
[1:44:23] the Holy Spirit knows you didn't mean
[1:44:26] that and he say you're
[1:44:32] forgiven how not all them quotes if
[1:44:35] people wants to quote
[1:44:38] one-sided we not quote at
[1:44:40] all there's none good no not
[1:44:45] one but we are the body of Jesus Christ
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:53] and if David under the condition he was
[1:44:57] could go before God and say Lord I love
[1:44:59] you I'm sorry and God come back say
[1:45:01] you're the apple of my eye that's
[1:45:05] right David is the one that said blessed
[1:45:08] is the man to whom God will not impute
[1:45:11] sin
[1:45:16] am because if he imput it to him he
[1:45:18] killed
[1:45:21] him why did he not kill King because
[1:45:24] David cried out in his
[1:45:26] heart oh Lord restore unto me the joy of
[1:45:30] thy
[1:45:33] salvation he had a repentant heart
[1:45:36] that's what God Said you you sacrifice
[1:45:39] and offerings become a stink in my
[1:45:41] nostrils he with to a man with an honest
[1:45:44] and a contrite heart right
[1:45:48] amen David was quick to
[1:45:50] repent amen and do what God
[1:45:54] Said what about us come on this what
[1:45:58] about you and
[1:46:02] me so well we've been over this we know
[1:46:05] what we're talking about here this okay
[1:46:07] but we just one more time
[1:46:10] tonight saying that in the New Birth
[1:46:12] we're perfectly totally sinless but in
[1:46:15] these human bodies we got problems that
[1:46:17] don't make us to where we can say I
[1:46:19] can't Happ it don't get into the garbage
[1:46:22] camp
[1:46:27] say I'm
[1:46:30] sorry forgive me
[1:46:33] Lord help
[1:46:35] me keep me from doing it
[1:46:38] Lord you know my weakness you know my
[1:46:42] problems amen but take away the desire
[1:46:45] brother Tom years ago and this before he
[1:46:48] ever come into message he caught
[1:46:49] something somewhere from the scriptures

[1:46:54] praying for to quit
[1:46:56] smoking and he said Lord take away the
[1:47:01] need and the
