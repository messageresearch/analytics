[1:57] sit back and talk about the Lord that
[2:00] even come among us and work out a lot of
[2:02] things for us okay
[2:03] I just keep remembering brother dick
[2:05] with Addison I talked to him this
[2:07] afternoon and he's having a lot of
[2:09] troubles with his back he's got about
[2:12] three disc herniated discs right what'd
[2:15] you call him two of them one's messed up
[2:17] real bad and you know which one thing
[2:20] after the other is beating on him
[2:21] so just keep praying for it and hold him
[2:23] up and he was life and said we're all
[2:25] getting old you know so that's that's
[2:28] the point we were all getting old
[2:30] together in that way we can can have a
[2:33] good time in that but you know what
[2:35] we're also getting younger together oh
[2:38] that's that's part of the to know to
[2:41] getting younger and they meant but just
[2:43] remember that and they were to pray for
[2:44] him it to the Lord would touch him and
[2:47] bring him on out of all of these times
[2:49] remember all these others that are sick
[2:51] among us how do we know that the devil
[2:54] doing everything he can on ever form to
[2:57] try to hinder us to keep us from walking
[2:59] on in him okay
[3:02] if you like turning your scriptures turn
[3:04] what we've been reading from Ephesians 2
[3:06] and here ooze for and just let's read
[3:12] this and go right into the word and try
[3:14] to pick up where we left off Sunday but
[3:16] I want to try to bring this stock in
[3:19] tonight a little bit to you know open
[3:24] our eyes maybe to things that has been
[3:27] but also see what is taking place now
[3:31] the causes that's the main thing you see
[3:34] we're right now right okay father we
[3:37] thank you for this day in your grace and
[3:39] thank you for your love and your
[3:40] understanding of us thank you for you
[3:43] Lord and we ask you to just come among
[3:45] us and just be with us and bless and
[3:47] guide each one keep us all in your love
[3:50] that our hearts may be knit together in
[3:53] you that we may see Christ
[3:55] let's forgive our sins and lead us and
[3:58] keep us in your love let your love and
[4:00] understanding be in each heart because
[4:03] that's the main thing for all of us we
[4:05] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[4:06] Amen
[4:08] remember sister Jeanne she had her hand
[4:10] operated on today
[4:11] corporal Tana love it you know what it
[4:14] was and talk to her a little bit ago and
[4:17] said she was George doing good so just
[4:19] keep praying for the Lord take care of
[4:21] all things
[4:22] hmm seasons 2 and verse 5 even when we
[4:29] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[4:31] together with Christ by grace you're
[4:34] saved and hath raised us up together and
[4:37] made us sit together in heavenly places
[4:40] in Christ Jesus
[4:42] that in the ages to come he might show
[4:44] the receding riches of his grace in his
[4:47] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[4:50] so the future a promise that in the
[4:54] future there's going to be greater
[4:56] things and the prophet said it right
[4:58] then God would give us his message of
[5:01] cheer down through the ages to come all
[5:03] right in ages to come he might shew the
[5:06] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[5:08] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[5:10] well my grace you're saved through faith
[5:13] that not of yourselves it is a gift of
[5:16] God not of works lest any man should
[5:18] boast okay let's go over to Hebrews 4:12
[5:25] for the word of God is quick and
[5:28] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[5:31] sword piercing even to the dividing
[5:34] asunder of soul and spirit and of the
[5:38] joints and marrow and is a discerner of
[5:41] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[5:44] so the word is the main thing right it
[5:46] will divide you may be seated the Lord
[5:48] and His blessing to the reading of the
[5:52] word now I want to try to pick up the
[5:58] point that we left off Sunday and then
[6:01] move on into that just a little bit and
[6:03] get a better understanding of where
[6:07] we're at we're talking about that you
[6:11] say by grace through faith
[6:13] it's a journey it's an experience the
[6:18] Prophet said you can be born again
[6:22] without having a sensation but he never
[6:25] I have never been able to find it if you
[6:27] can let me know where he ever said that
[6:30] you could be born again without an
[6:32] experience there's a lot of difference
[6:35] in a sensation and experience an
[6:38] experience is something you live through
[6:40] all right whereas a sensation is just a
[6:44] stimulation upon your your inward parts
[6:48] and and things and working back out into
[6:50] the outward part and and can be easily
[6:55] the devil working in many ways aren't
[6:58] but now because it I've tried to get it
[7:02] don't misunderstand me in what i'ma
[7:05] bring in I believe that I tried to say
[7:09] it are Sundy but you know by not saying
[7:11] a whole lot about something maybe
[7:13] sometimes if people who miss it
[7:14] well I believe in salvation as something
[7:19] you live through alright
[7:21] the disciples lived three and a half
[7:24] years in their experience
[7:28] right of the Lord Jesus with him raised
[7:32] in the dead healing the sick signs and
[7:34] wonders taking place among them and it
[7:36] never gave none of them the new birth
[7:40] they had to go to the upper room to
[7:44] receive Christ all right but the three
[7:46] thousand outside see some of them just
[7:48] barely heard the word things like that
[7:49] and they received the word and received
[7:52] the new birth so don't think that I'm
[7:54] saying that well brother Dale believes
[7:56] in a prolonged or a long time between
[8:00] each stages now it's according to your
[8:03] ways you're studying your thoughts that
[8:07] according to each one you know being
[8:10] different so as I remember making a
[8:13] statement I said it can your journey can
[8:16] be three minutes or it can be ten years
[8:19] well my point was you know it could be
[8:22] quie real quick I believe I believe you
[8:25] can come to the altar and believe all
[8:28] the way to receiving the baptism of the
[8:30] Holy Ghost I believe it now what the
[8:32] Prophet said very few people would so I
[8:35] believe in that now so don't told me so
[8:38] well brother Dale blues this you know he
[8:41] don't understand it no I try to make
[8:43] both sides to where it'll fit your
[8:47] experience may be a long experience may
[8:50] time and all I have but to someone else
[8:53] it may be real quick and Feist you know
[8:56] to do because he you've got the house of
[8:59] Cornelius they had heard the word they
[9:03] had been studying the Bible and and
[9:04] studying about this coming Messiah and
[9:07] it everything within the Holy Ghost just
[9:10] fell all at once all right you got
[9:13] experiences like that so don't
[9:14] misunderstand me to think when I say
[9:17] that it took the disciples three and a
[9:19] half years that's true too right I see
[9:23] you don't discount that is the only
[9:25] thing I'm saying I don't discount them
[9:28] I'm believing that and you just don't
[9:30] discount it and make me it's something
[9:32] brother Dale believes you you may be
[9:34] twenty years seeking God you may be
[9:38] you maybe I told my own experience when
[9:43] I was two years in this message seeking
[9:46] the baptism of the holy ghost before I
[9:48] received well that was my experience
[9:51] what I just read I just got it this
[9:53] quick as I okay yeah no problem long as
[9:57] you got it right
[10:00] you know matters that said three minutes
[10:02] for 10 years as long as you got it
[10:05] that's the main thing make sure you got
[10:07] it and I always tell you my point is
[10:10] what I'd rather go through life seeking
[10:11] God come to the end of it find out I've
[10:14] always had him or to go through life and
[10:17] not having him and missing the whole
[10:18] time you said well could I do that
[10:21] well anointed ones and that's what we
[10:24] want to touch a little to not about
[10:27] anointed ones is a dangerous situation
[10:30] we'll back up on it on the justification
[10:34] sanctification and cover a few things to
[10:37] to get into that but you know I want you
[10:42] to think with me and then try to get the
[10:46] pointed I'm driving up because basically
[10:50] now I used the word correctly basically
[10:53] in brother branham's early ministry up
[10:56] until right into the greatest battle
[11:00] ever fall from right into there he begin
[11:02] to see things honor I say more clearer
[11:06] you can argue that whatever you want I
[11:09] can eating you at all alone I ain't
[11:10] gonna argue with you about it I'm just
[11:12] gonna say I believe it cuz I believe the
[11:14] Lord Jesus grows in grace and knowledge
[11:16] so I don't argue for nothing else and
[11:19] you know no problems there's no argument
[11:22] it's just a point
[11:24] all right but see we went through and we
[11:27] showed the difference
[11:29] that in his early ministry he preached
[11:34] basically and used it in draught
[11:37] illustrations and things and covered the
[11:40] human being as the triune being that we
[11:44] are and that's what you know we remember
[11:48] we read that the other day but first
[11:52] Thessalonians 5 and 22 says that your
[11:56] whole spirit and soul and body be
[11:58] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[12:02] the Lord all right I have mentioned this
[12:05] many times to you maybe you never heard
[12:07] it I ran into this before I heard her at
[12:10] the time maybe I was hearing the
[12:11] prophets message but they used to be a
[12:13] doctor among some of the organized
[12:15] religions that you didn't even have a
[12:17] soul until the law came into be I don't
[12:20] know where you've ever heard that or not
[12:22] but that was a doctrine they said you
[12:25] didn't have a soul to the law because
[12:26] the law brought your knowledge of sin
[12:29] well that sounds good and I said to her
[12:33] at work and listen to a man present his
[12:35] points you know and when it was over he
[12:38] said something about the soul you know
[12:40] and he said to me you know personally
[12:42] and I said well I always thought you
[12:46] saying that man didn't have a soul until
[12:49] the law came unsaid I always thought the
[12:52] Bible saying that he breathed into the
[12:55] Adams nostrils and he'd become a living
[12:57] soul he said I never thought of that I
[13:01] said well I had because that's the Bible
[13:04] you know let's see that's that can be
[13:07] man's ideas and thoughts coming in to
[13:11] where it'll get confusing and that's
[13:14] what confuses and brings us all into a
[13:16] position of having to fight those ideas
[13:20] and thoughts that we once had oh I just
[13:23] got rid of every time no no you don't do
[13:26] that that's they settle down and quit to
[13:29] action well if we have time we don't
[13:32] we'll pick it up Sunday the Prophet
[13:34] spoke of it
[13:36] in anointed ones the end of that day was
[13:41] three unclean spirits like frogs would
[13:44] go out in the last days brother Bob now
[13:46] we're talking about it the other night
[13:48] three unclean spirits like after the
[13:52] opening of the seals no I didn't say
[13:58] that that's enough no one wants them
[13:59] time after the opening of the seals
[14:04] three unclean spirits like frogs
[14:07] I'm looking at that now whether you're
[14:09] looking at or not I'm looking at it
[14:11] because I'm looking at seeing what's
[14:14] being done where people won't listen to
[14:17] the word and just like me is saying that
[14:21] what you know me trying to explain body
[14:24] spirit soul body folk soul spirit well
[14:27] why does it matter what does it matter
[14:31] well get baptized Lord Jesus Christ we
[14:34] just for Father Son Holy Ghost
[14:36] assistance there oh and why would it be
[14:42] so much to your profit will read it in a
[14:45] minute
[14:45] that he says that after the opening of
[14:50] the seals these things come out you
[14:56] never preached anointed ones until 65
[15:04] he did appreciate till after the opening
[15:06] of the seals well see it's more serious
[15:12] than we think well what does it matter
[15:14] there so long as we get saved that's
[15:16] what I'm trying to do I'm trying my best
[15:18] and every way that I can to finding a
[15:21] way to get me and you to a place to be
[15:23] born again and they'll take care of the
[15:25] whole thing
[15:26] we won't have to worry about nothing but
[15:29] now being foolish to the point of this
[15:31] well it don't make no difference
[15:35] we wanted to profit preached anointed
[15:38] one but don't make no difference why do
[15:41] priests marriage and divorce I don't
[15:44] make no difference whitey Fritz Kreisler
[15:45] mr. Garner there don't mean oh dear my
[15:47] deep resurgence milchester when he said
[15:57] that when the seals broke the Bob will
[16:00] became a wife a brand-new book or maybe
[16:06] he used the word new was a four times a
[16:09] huge brand new she didn't does it matter
[16:14] well does it matter at all let's just
[16:18] eat drink and be merry go I'm gonna be
[16:19] happy about it forget it no I'm fighting
[16:25] for my soul and yours whether you like
[16:27] what I do or the way I do or not I don't
[16:30] bother me at all I'm just fighting for
[16:33] try to get the truth to you and me to
[16:35] where we can see it for our own sales
[16:39] and follow it from that line and be able
[16:44] to walk out of here then when we get
[16:46] dark
[16:46] ain't gonna be no argument well I try to
[16:48] tell you ain't gonna be no argument when
[16:51] we get there you know they won't we just
[16:55] won't get dark that'll be the main thing
[16:57] but now listen see in this early
[17:00] ministry
[17:04] before the opening of the seals before
[17:08] the word become more open to him he
[17:12] taught things on the basic line of what
[17:15] organized religion talked body-soul
[17:23] second trim spirit center rim I gave you
[17:27] them read them to you there this past
[17:30] Sunday all right where he made those and
[17:33] he made the drawing greatest battle ever
[17:35] fought
[17:35] he made the drawing we put up the
[17:37] drawing here to see the difference
[17:39] between this early ministry and the late
[17:43] ministry early ministry he taught I said
[17:47] basically cuz listen he always said the
[17:50] soul is the real you you always believed
[17:58] in that and now what are you gonna
[18:02] believe it or not but we we're gonna get
[18:04] back to the to the future home one of
[18:07] these days where he made the statement
[18:09] and he said I taught three processes
[18:14] from the beginning as a boy and said
[18:18] never changed one iota
[18:23] well then we say he chained here any
[18:25] chain here huh he didn't change is what
[18:29] we think each other all right
[18:33] see you say well what is the importance
[18:36] of knowing the difference between sold
[18:37] in spirit
[18:38] where are you born again is your born
[18:44] again experience in your body is it in
[18:48] your spirit it it in your soul and see
[18:56] you don't follow the line that I do
[18:59] stay there years listening to those
[19:02] things fighting out of the people that
[19:05] followed that to soul doctrine
[19:08] back in the seventies and all I got it
[19:11] with this and it's still going around
[19:12] the world but they cannot take from 65
[19:18] on and preach their two souls you can't
[19:26] do it not stay in the early ministry you
[19:31] better remember too that the Bible has
[19:34] always been right Ezekiel 18 for all
[19:40] souls are mine the Bible says the soul
[19:47] that sinneth it shall die doesn't say
[19:49] anything about the spirit that's in it
[19:51] is the soul that sinneth where did
[19:55] brother Branham when he went beyond the
[19:56] curtain of time did he see spirits
[19:59] I'm asking you you've read the message
[20:02] you heard him
[20:03] Artie do you say he saw sold didn't you
[20:06] read it were and we've read it over and
[20:08] over to you or even the angel of the
[20:10] Lord referred to souls under the altar
[20:13] it sold under the altars under the fifth
[20:15] seal putting it back to beyond the
[20:17] curtain of time was brother Randall he
[20:24] said well what's the difference
[20:26] do you know what the new birth is how
[20:31] can you be born again if you don't know
[20:33] well I just bypass them things I did I
[20:37] just got no one to believe I just I just
[20:40] come into mansions and I know I'm right
[20:42] cold I believe the message
[20:49] could I say something I'm being too hard
[20:52] how can you say you believe the message
[20:56] then you're gonna say it don't make no
[20:58] difference what you're whether it's body
[21:01] spirit show some spirit body weight
[21:02] don't lean over now you tell me you I
[21:07] know I know that cuts and I know that
[21:10] hurts I know you think I'm calling you a
[21:13] lot of things
[21:14] mind if that does it to save you I'll
[21:16] call you that
[21:17] sorry I'm just to the human point that I
[21:23] know that if we're not walking you never
[21:24] worked it just took one I hear is that
[21:29] three unclean spirits like frogs get it
[21:32] in Bible they took one word one word
[21:37] took us out of the garden right you mean
[21:44] we're going back with it all messed up
[21:46] no we're not no that's why we're here
[21:50] you want to know from me why we're here
[21:52] we're here because we got it
[21:54] straightened up
[21:57] we still got our own ideas and thoughts
[22:01] where would three unclean spirits like
[22:03] frogs go to run said they come out of
[22:07] the old Trinity he said the old trinity
[22:11] comes from Rome you know the story right
[22:17] where did the old original Trinity come
[22:19] from from from Roman Catholics who
[22:24] believes in idols and son - right then
[22:28] it come on in to the Trinity of the
[22:34] Catholic Church
[22:35] well now what would be the new Trinity
[22:40] he said come out of the old Trinity that
[22:47] new Trinity is being you taking this
[22:49] word and because of our own self and
[22:53] interpretation in any way twisting that
[22:56] to make it different from what it is
[22:59] there's a new Trinity now you think I
[23:02] ain't looking at it look at all these
[23:04] across the land it's left a message
[23:11] could that be the new Trinity cuz what
[23:16] would it be well brother Browns right on
[23:18] sometimes but he ain't right on
[23:20] everything well no you know what if you
[23:26] can correct brother Brandon come on if
[23:30] you can correct brother branham take off
[23:33] your shoe and walk down here I want to
[23:36] kiss your toe now you know what that
[23:39] means don't see that means the Pope the
[23:45] Pope ain't that far all he's against the
[23:47] message we ain't that far off code you
[23:49] don't know how to be that far off three
[23:54] unclean spirits like frogs frogs look
[23:57] backward what was the thing the Prophet
[24:00] said our problem would looking backward
[24:03] looking forward I'm not seeing one snail
[24:07] I'm sorry I'm sorry for trying to tell
[24:13] you the truth no I don't care about that
[24:16] part
[24:19] because I believe we're gonna get out of
[24:21] here all right
[24:25] and he's gonna take the full word all
[24:28] right now are you with me and what I'm
[24:30] talking about
[24:31] we gave you the quotes no you still got
[24:36] the same notes all right we gave you the
[24:40] quotes so one and 61-62 and on through
[24:48] there there what's your profit talk go
[24:55] ahead number two we'll read these we'll
[24:57] put it right back out read it again just
[24:59] the same way we've read it because I
[25:02] believe it all right this is from the
[25:04] message called the inside 1962 119 okay
[25:10] man is made up as a triune being so body
[25:14] spirit now the outside is the body
[25:16] there's five gates to that body and
[25:18] that's the five senses of course CJ's
[25:21] filled smells in here inside like the
[25:24] seed that's planted I'm about a plan of
[25:27] a natural seed penny bean corn the
[25:29] inside of that seed is a puff like of
[25:32] the seed which is the sole there is five
[25:34] gates to that you enter into its
[25:37] conscious memory and so forth
[25:39] within inside of that little compart
[25:41] little that little compartment is the
[25:44] third compartment which is the spirit
[25:46] okay there's only one Avenue through
[25:50] that and that self we'll all right then
[25:55] so he's teaching body by senses second
[26:03] room five senses memory reason conscious
[26:09] calling it the soul
[26:13] yeah and then he's showing you the
[26:16] compartment in the middle which has only
[26:19] one sense either faith or doubt he calls
[26:22] that spirit he draws out the little
[26:25] circles were safe down to reading him
[26:27] but he draws out the little circles on
[26:30] blasphemous names and he gave those
[26:33] little circles and told I gave you from
[26:37] the message the in sign and gave you
[26:40] from the message the revelation of Jesus
[26:42] Christ
[26:44] 1961 0 101 gave you a paradox 1962 1228
[27:01] so you made up a soul body and spirit
[27:04] the outside which is the body is
[27:07] controlled by five senses you enter the
[27:10] body by the five senses see taste feel
[27:14] smelling here and inside the body is a
[27:17] soul and that soul has five cents five
[27:22] cents gates and so forth memory reasons
[27:26] but inside of that is a spirit and
[27:29] that's what controls it okay so there no
[27:33] problem but now you that was here Sunday
[27:37] or have heard the message remember one
[27:39] thing for sure I'm not trying to correct
[27:43] brother branham because I told you 40
[27:45] years ago I was teaching this same thing
[27:48] or more that's brother Colley he said
[27:51] I've got even some of the notes inside
[27:53] you know his way of talking I've always
[27:56] taught it because what are you gonna do
[27:59] it you got brother branham that looks
[28:00] like he goes this away then he looks
[28:02] like he goes that way
[28:05] but he was right when he was teaching
[28:07] body soul and spirit because he gave the
[28:14] five senses he always gave the five
[28:18] senses to the body the five senses is
[28:20] the second dream five and one scent
[28:22] start to as he called it which is either
[28:24] faith or doubt one sense to the inner
[28:27] man he always talked to him he talked
[28:31] that in the beginning he taught it after
[28:33] the opening of the season amazing how
[28:39] God can keep him so correct when I'm
[28:43] telling you you didn't gonna like this
[28:45] statement but evidently he didn't have
[28:47] it lined up straight because he had it
[28:50] back in his early ministry did he
[28:52] followed that line but then when he come
[28:56] over in the opening of the word which
[28:58] was the anointed ones that's the basics
[29:04] when he started 1965 11:25 1965
[29:11] did he started on anointed ones and he
[29:16] starts explaining the end of body spirit
[29:19] and so what now on anointed ones that
[29:27] was the key I tried to get you to see
[29:29] Sunday anointed ones where is the
[29:32] anointing at on an anointed one
[29:39] the Prophet said is in your spirit
[29:45] so then if he hadn't brought that if the
[29:48] Lord
[29:49] in other words plain language whether
[29:50] you like it's what do God had to open
[29:54] the eyes of the profit on anointed ones
[29:57] now if you don't believe me read the
[29:59] book no let me read it
[30:01] let me just read it okay and see what he
[30:05] said let's see if this is important when
[30:08] he comes to the anointed ones in 1965
[30:11] 7:25 he says and seeing all this
[30:15] accumulation of evidence that the hour
[30:18] that work that we now live in I think
[30:21] it's a good thing to rehearse these
[30:23] things and draw them out since this
[30:25] fields has been opened and find out the
[30:28] truth of these things as God has been so
[30:31] loyal with us with His grace to show us
[30:33] these things I want you to notice here
[30:35] in Matthew 24 Jesus used the term Christ
[30:38] sees our ist as Christ not Christ not
[30:42] singular but Christ plural not singular
[30:45] Christ alright anointed coming down that
[30:50] was paragraph 22 23 24 paragraph 44
[30:54] anointed wants the end time but you see
[30:57] he sends a rain back to our subject on
[31:01] the just and the unjust Jesus tells you
[31:04] here in Matthew 24 it would be a sign at
[31:08] the end time what would be a sign at the
[31:11] end time he just told you up here
[31:16] Matthew 24 covers Christ it's right
[31:19] across many now if this sign is only to
[31:24] be known at the end time it'll have to
[31:27] be after the opening of those seals see
[31:31] it's a son well they got it up here it's
[31:34] the sign of the end that would be when
[31:37] these things happen it'll be at the end
[31:40] time and it'll be a sign and so the
[31:42] election will not be confused in these
[31:44] things then it's got to be revealed
[31:49] why do we need to know the difference
[31:50] between body spirit and soul are you
[31:53] nobody sold spirit or anointed ones I
[31:57] remember this because he does not cover
[32:02] on anointed ones he does not make the
[32:05] statement now you read it bring it to me
[32:07] he makes the statement but you got
[32:09] itself interpreted he does not say the
[32:13] anointing is on your spirit well the
[32:18] only once in time he does not use that
[32:22] terms then he uses later on in his
[32:25] message as come on folks I forget I've
[32:30] been in this 40 years so don't worry
[32:32] about it our faith preachers standing
[32:35] and saying hey no y'all are saying
[32:37] because you can quote brother Branham
[32:38] back then we only had one or two books
[32:40] and you quote that anointing is on your
[32:43] spirit
[32:45] well he only said it on that one time on
[32:47] our own so it's not in northern ones the
[32:50] in time it's not he preaches it because
[32:54] he preaches the Christ but he doesn't
[32:57] say the anointing is just on your spirit
[33:00] he just says on anointed one that you
[33:04] can be baptized with a genuine baptism
[33:06] of the Holy Spirit and still be lost he
[33:10] doesn't put the basis and were sacked
[33:14] now remember the dates that was 11:25
[33:24] 1120 used me it's your got it right it's
[33:28] 11 2011
[33:30] excuse me 65 725 is when the Illinois
[33:35] was free northern ones all right now he
[33:39] preaches in the evening that's the
[33:42] morning he preaches in the evening
[33:46] the only ones he goes to the next wins
[33:49] next wins tea and excuse me
[33:53] priestess Christ is revealed in his own
[33:55] word then he preaches thinking man's
[33:57] builder and knoweth it not trying to do
[33:59] God a service rapture things that are to
[34:02] be power to transform and leadership
[34:05] each one of them he brings out and
[34:09] preaches body spirit and so what are you
[34:17] gonna do with anointed ones are you
[34:20] anointed on your spirit are you anointed
[34:22] on your soul which one is it
[34:27] what does it matter because you don't
[34:29] know whether you're born again or not
[34:33] come on
[34:36] you don't know whether you're born again
[34:38] or not because were you born again at if
[34:44] we are to be born again in our soul we
[34:46] need to get it in the soul if we're
[34:48] gonna be born again in our spirit we
[34:49] need to get in the spirit we're gonna be
[34:51] born again in our body we'd never get it
[34:52] in the body right is that sensible you
[34:59] see that's where when the Prophet when
[35:01] it opened when it opened
[35:05] he had draw those three reigns on
[35:07] blasphemy on the greatest battle ever
[35:09] fought in 62 he comes back in 65 and
[35:13] draws him Satan realms and says body
[35:16] spirit and so he said in C you can be
[35:21] anointed on your spirit and still be
[35:25] lost
[35:28] do you believe that you believe you can
[35:31] actually be on those times we didn't get
[35:33] to read these other day but let's read
[35:35] some of it okay let's go to number five
[35:41] and knoweth it not now here's what
[35:44] happens now watch this just a little
[35:49] figurative picture here what that's
[35:53] that's greatest battle ever fought I
[35:55] don't want to come on it come to the
[35:59] next message and North it not brother
[36:04] Brandon shows his drawing of the three
[36:07] range
[36:08] this is 65 after 91 was preached the
[36:15] date the only ones was preached on 725
[36:19] 815 okay come on and what does he say
[36:25] it's what we look at what we see it has
[36:27] five inlets to that body in any grammar
[36:30] school child as myself would know that
[36:34] there's five senses to the body see
[36:36] taste feels militant here you can't
[36:38] touch the body it's the only way you can
[36:40] have through the body see taste feel
[36:42] smell in here all right that for the
[36:44] evil one works on the outside now inside
[36:47] of that is a spirit which you become
[36:50] when you're born in the earth and the
[36:53] breath of life is breathed into you that
[36:55] spirit is of a world in nature because
[36:57] it was not given from God but was given
[37:01] and watch him permitted in other words
[37:05] it wasn't made of God to be wrong right
[37:09] is that what he's saying it wasn't made
[37:12] to be wrong oh I didn't make it wrong he
[37:15] permitted it to come into a worldly
[37:17] nature he didn't make it wrong you can't
[37:21] have God making your soul spirit or body
[37:23] whatever wrong and then condemn you you
[37:27] can't do that
[37:29] it wouldn't be a just God so watch what
[37:33] he's saying but it was given permitted
[37:36] now you got that and every child that's
[37:39] born in the world is born in sin sin and
[37:41] iniquity come to world speaking lies
[37:42] right that person inside dark is a
[37:45] sinner to begin with then you got five
[37:49] inlets and then five will inlets he said
[37:52] first I know it's tall conscious love
[37:55] choice no conscious memory there is the
[37:57] five inlets to the spirit now listen to
[38:01] it you can't think with your body you
[38:04] have to think with your spirit you can't
[38:06] have conscience in your body it has no
[38:09] mental faculties at all what I feel I
[38:13] can see that's where people I don't he
[38:16] don't know how to explain it it was he
[38:18] literate
[38:20] I never heard of nobody would a college
[38:26] degree that ever defeated his
[38:28] terminologies do you it may sound like
[38:34] it wasn't too good but if you listen to
[38:37] it it'll tell you the truth so you can't
[38:40] think with the body you have to think
[38:41] with your spirit you can't how conscious
[38:43] and in your body is there's no mental
[38:45] faculties all your body does so you have
[38:48] to think with your spirit you have to
[38:50] reason you can't reason with your
[38:52] physical being reason doesn't see touch
[38:54] feel smell hear reason is what you can
[38:57] make in your mind if you're asleep or
[39:00] you're out your body is lying there dead
[39:02] but your spirit can still reason there
[39:06] is five senses that controls that inside
[39:09] man and that now to the last man which
[39:13] is the soul there is only one sense that
[39:16] controlled that and that is free moral
[39:19] agency to a right to choose in other
[39:22] words
[39:23] so what's he explaining now body spirit
[39:28] and soul now you can understand it when
[39:32] we get to these other words down here
[39:34] that you'll find out where it comes from
[39:36] all right that's going over what was
[39:38] that one let's go to number six rocks
[39:43] revealing his own word lie Sunday
[39:47] which was a days preaching on only once
[39:50] in time when we was going into those
[39:53] cycles about that the five senses on the
[39:58] outer rim that's the inlet five senses
[40:01] to the body there's only one way you can
[40:03] get into the body that's about five
[40:05] senses CJ's feel smell in here there's
[40:08] no other way to contact the body when
[40:11] the inside of that man is a man called
[40:13] spirit and he has five senses think
[40:16] thought thought love and conscious and
[40:19] so forth now you can't think with your
[40:22] body you think with your mind and there
[40:25] is worth to many of Christians only stop
[40:30] and they can just like the corn in the
[40:33] field and the weed in the field they can
[40:36] be anointed with the same Holy Spirit
[40:39] that the real believer is anointed with
[40:42] but down on the inside of that next room
[40:46] third rim so where's the anointing
[40:49] second rim now listen he was listening
[40:53] to one ago when they first started back
[40:56] in the seventies and the things about
[40:58] the anointed ones in sight we didn't
[41:00] have no quotes to argue with him with
[41:02] the people we had ministers meetings we
[41:06] didn't have no quotes to argue
[41:08] because the books were not out we didn't
[41:10] have the ability
[41:11] I remember when some started appearing
[41:15] that you could start saying hey wait a
[41:17] minute he's talking about the spirit go
[41:19] you tell a lot of you tell the to slow
[41:21] people LaRon was talking about anointing
[41:23] on his fear no he said so
[41:28] he's an Engel listen to you what are we
[41:32] gonna do and then on the inside of that
[41:33] next room the third room is a soul and
[41:36] that's the predestinated that's where
[41:38] the real seed germinates okay go ahead
[41:40] to the next one there's more of that
[41:44] legacy in church 8 which is he's reading
[41:47] from that but he still own the crisis
[41:51] revealing his own work no see see the
[41:56] Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his
[41:59] spirit but his soul is his journey the
[42:08] anointing can fall in your spirit but
[42:14] the soul is the journey that germ is the
[42:17] word come on I don't care how much you
[42:22] can preach how well you do this and how
[42:24] much you love that's one of the inlets
[42:26] to spirit you can't love with your body
[42:29] you love with your spirit that's one of
[42:32] the inlets you don't love with your body
[42:35] you display it that's one of the inlets
[42:38] and you can love and even love God and
[42:41] still not be right you can cast out
[42:43] Devils and preach and do these things
[42:46] still not be right you just said so said
[42:49] many would come in that day okay go
[42:52] ahead
[42:54] what's the next number sick number I
[43:00] thinking man's filter come on up now as
[43:05] I spoke this morning and life Sunday
[43:09] morning on that wheel in the middle of
[43:13] the wheel or that little inside sole on
[43:16] the inside of the spirit how does the
[43:20] spirit Canon now that the spirit on the
[43:23] outside between the soul in the body
[43:28] can be absolutely anointed with the holy
[43:31] ghost did you understand that what of
[43:35] that with this continuity the message
[43:37] god of this world anointed ones in the
[43:40] last days and inside that middle circle
[43:43] first circle is the human senses second
[43:46] circle now he's coming outside going
[43:48] inward second sir I mean in we're coming
[43:50] out the second circle is the spirit
[43:53] sentences self will desire so forth but
[43:56] the inside is the soul that so was
[43:59] predestinated so they can annoy this
[44:03] spirit to make the outside body come
[44:06] into subjection to the spirit with the
[44:08] soul that sinneth that's social not in
[44:10] the soul that rejects in unbelief the
[44:13] Word of God which is a part of that soul
[44:16] no words why is it gonna be run it up he
[44:19] can get down to the bottom she might
[44:22] sing in the choir
[44:23] she might dance in this period she might
[44:25] speak in tongues and have all the
[44:27] manifestations of the spirit but unless
[44:30] that soul on the inside is God's
[44:33] daughter see she's gone now what is it
[44:39] if it's not done come on
[44:42] what's the next no trying to do go to
[44:47] service see how the Holy Spirit can a
[44:50] known a man but it's got to be listen in
[44:53] the order of the anointing listen the
[44:58] outside spirit can be anointed with the
[45:00] holy spirit and the soul as dark his
[45:03] pitch now you know for certain which one
[45:07] he's talking about don't you
[45:09] the Spirit is worthy of mourning falls
[45:12] those the soul is either white or black
[45:15] it's one of the two you got to cook a
[45:17] burger think what the soul is of it is
[45:20] cocklebur the false teachers can rise
[45:23] teaching all kind of trinitarianism and
[45:26] everything else and be anointed with the
[45:28] Holy Ghost and perform just as many
[45:30] miracles as the true gospel can
[45:34] continuum number nine the rapture you
[45:40] say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:42] they don't mean that you're saved not by
[45:45] a long ways the year you're a try on
[45:51] being you're inside this little fella
[45:52] here is the soul now what's you in a
[45:55] minute
[45:55] the next is the spirit the next is the
[45:57] body you got five senses in this body to
[46:00] continue to act your earthly home they
[46:02] don't contact the rest of it
[46:04] you got five senses of the Spirit low
[46:06] conscious and so forth but in here is
[46:08] where you live that's what you are or
[46:12] let's all right sure well what is it one
[46:15] of them will bar a cocoa butter cuz
[46:17] that's all ahead the cocklebur will
[46:20] raise up okay go ahead things that are
[46:26] to be there are three people of you the
[46:30] outside is the body
[46:31] you got five senses that you contact the
[46:34] earthly home with the inside is the
[46:36] spirit there's five senses darl of in
[46:38] conscious so for you but the inside of
[46:41] that is the soul keep on going
[46:46] what number which we hold on the number
[46:49] eleven okay which is the power of
[46:54] transformation that little inside of the
[46:56] inside that's where you start which is
[46:59] your soul
[47:00] can you come from that your spirit then
[47:03] you become a living being and a living
[47:05] being that five senses to conduct the
[47:07] second has five senses that's the
[47:09] outside body see touch feel smell in
[47:11] here the inside body had love conscious
[47:13] and so forth but the inside of the
[47:15] inside the control tower is either God
[47:17] or Satan though the soul is either God
[47:22] or Satan whatever we want to make it
[47:24] okay next is leadership look here on the
[47:29] outside person you've got five senses
[47:31] they can't run that guy outside he had
[47:33] five senses contact with earthly home
[47:36] then you know were spirit on the inside
[47:37] of that and it has five outlets
[47:39] conscience and love and so forth five
[47:42] outlets that you contact the spirit
[47:44] world with that but with your spirit
[47:48] your physical contacts of physical
[47:50] spiritual contacts are spiritual but
[47:53] inside of that you've got a soul and
[47:55] that soul is that gene that come from
[47:59] God
[47:59] okay works is faith Express now remember
[48:05] you're in a cycle of the three which
[48:07] you're one person like Father Son and
[48:09] Holy Ghost cycle of three the one person
[48:12] three attributes to the same God
[48:15] fatherhood the Three Olives is like
[48:17] fatherhood sons you all ago and you are
[48:19] body spirit and soul outside of the body
[48:22] has five endless
[48:24] to contact your earthly home see taste
[48:26] feel smelling hear the inside which is a
[48:28] spirit it has five senses conscious and
[48:31] love is over but the inside of that the
[48:33] soul has one thing that's where you live
[48:35] the spirit come and watch now the spirit
[48:39] can come out here and anoint you to do
[48:43] certain things and you do it but that
[48:46] don't mean you're saved where's it an
[48:50] anointing you that in your spirit think
[48:55] of me that cough let's promise that
[48:56] Judas casts out Devils the spirit
[48:59] anointed in this rain falls when
[49:01] adjusting the unjust the weeds can
[49:03] rejoice with the wheat which is what's
[49:06] that that core there's where you can
[49:08] intellectuals can accept and say oh sure
[49:11] that looks good I believe that I still
[49:14] that still don't do it no sir and the
[49:18] spirit can actually make witness of it
[49:20] and still it isn't so because that soul
[49:23] hasn't come from God come on it can make
[49:28] all the impersonations out there but it
[49:30] cannot be real you can actively you can
[49:33] act like you have you can act like you
[49:34] receive it Christians can act like
[49:36] they're Christians in action be so good
[49:38] at it but that don't mean you're saved
[49:41] that's exactly right and the spirit can
[49:43] be the real genuine spirit the Holy
[49:46] Spirit can anoint you and that spirit
[49:49] still don't mean you're saved it's that
[49:52] inside soul that never dies it's got
[49:55] eternal life it's the soul when we got
[49:59] what number 1 12 13 14
[50:08] I like to say things this way right in
[50:10] the middle of all of it you wondered
[50:12] what and wherever you come about I'm
[50:14] gonna say this you think I'm leaving out
[50:17] some of the things brother I don't say
[50:18] it I invite you to come and show me
[50:24] I've had these 40 years I ain't worrying
[50:27] that don't you think in any way that I
[50:31] ever leave anything out
[50:33] I try to prove a doctrine if you do you
[50:37] need to leave finds you another pastor
[50:39] if that's what you think your pastor
[50:41] does I'll help you find every quote you
[50:46] want that will even look like you to
[50:49] disprove me because I know for certain
[50:51] and ain't gonna do it he's never done it
[50:54] so far I'm not talking like this
[51:02] rocks revealed in his own word that
[51:07] doctor one we done read I think
[51:11] Christ revealed they don't work Oh 23
[51:15] yeah okay
[51:20] let's just put it out here and leave it
[51:23] right there now I believe the bread
[51:32] around him was a prophet born the
[51:34] Prophet but I do not believe he
[51:38] understood everything if he did then he
[51:41] lied when he said he did so that's a up
[51:43] to you to believe what you won't do
[51:45] about it that I'm not determining that
[51:47] that's nothing to me I've tried my best
[51:50] to search this message knowing that not
[51:53] only was my soul involved my family was
[51:56] involved and his church was involved and
[52:03] I've tried to study it to try to bring
[52:05] it out don't worry that you could make a
[52:07] choice you don't understand what I'm
[52:12] talking about when I say those two so
[52:14] people would rattle that message off but
[52:17] they always talked about your soul is
[52:19] just the nature of your spirit
[52:26] there is not a quote of that in the
[52:29] message find it for me he did not
[52:34] brother I've never said the soul is just
[52:36] the nature of the sphere
[52:38] he said the soul is the nature of the
[52:39] spirit they added to word just to it
[52:42] because that would just be enough to
[52:43] twist it he'll make it to word it really
[52:47] didn't mean nothing
[52:51] where is the new birth or does it type
[52:55] lies
[53:02] and what about it here comes a prophet
[53:05] to correct all errors he corrected those
[53:09] two so people and they never knew it
[53:13] they still won't have it
[53:22] say well whatever what are you talking
[53:24] about you could be anointed on your
[53:28] spirit we just read it do genuine things
[53:32] and still be lost they show me where he
[53:36] ever said you could be anointed on your
[53:38] soul that the soul is the real you the
[53:46] inner part of you the body five senses
[53:51] see taste feel smell in here the second
[53:55] realm of mankind whether you call it
[53:56] solar call experience is memory reason
[54:01] conscience etc the five senses but the
[54:08] soul has one sense and brother branham
[54:12] went beyond the curtain of time the
[54:14] angel of the Lord reading if you don't
[54:16] believe it Brian come to me I'll be glad
[54:18] to read it to you
[54:20] the angel of the Lord referred it said
[54:22] sold under the altar
[54:30] he saw real people he didn't see no
[54:34] spirits running around he saw real
[54:38] people in their soul which is their
[54:43] theophany come on he's one that said it
[54:48] was theophany he saw him dark and he
[54:52] said this that was the soul of man
[55:01] we're missing the whole thing by our own
[55:04] thoughts of taking what we believe about
[55:06] something instead of listening and ours
[55:09] where we'll end and say it that's where
[55:12] your three unclean spirits like frogs
[55:15] after the opening of the seals and
[55:18] that's what's your prophet say it after
[55:21] the opening of the seals you would have
[55:25] three unclean spirits like frogs
[55:33] age
[55:36] b-26 anointed wants the endtime
[55:41] paragraph 143 no notice the Trinity the
[55:47] Dragon him any knows what the dragon was
[55:50] it was wrong the dragon stood before the
[55:53] woman to devour her child as soon as it
[55:55] was born that right
[55:56] what does beast mean in the Bible power
[55:59] false prophets false prophet a false
[56:03] prophet a false anointed ones he started
[56:08] were this is false prophet singular
[56:12] because that's what it is you've got you
[56:14] you've got your order you got your
[56:16] Antichrist false prophet incarnate false
[56:20] prophet and beast that's your seal
[56:23] that's your for combat beast and the for
[56:26] to combat it alright so listen to what
[56:28] he's saying this is a false prophet
[56:32] singular false prophet Pope and there
[56:37] come up the and the mother of
[56:39] harlots the whole thing a false trinity
[56:42] was rising not in the early days
[56:46] wouldn't be made manifest in the early
[56:50] days now when was the Trinity way back
[56:54] before the Prophet right so listen to it
[56:58] it right right on through it and when
[57:01] the seven seals become and open those
[57:04] mysteries and reveal them
[57:06] that's when the frogs three unclean
[57:09] spirits like frogs come out to manifest
[57:12] themselves
[57:14] a Trinity doctrine against the to truth
[57:19] see where it come from words it going
[57:23] back to ecumenical council they're all
[57:26] brothers in the house same spirit same
[57:28] thing what
[57:28] so performing miracles these are Devils
[57:31] so forth to all the gods of the earth
[57:34] working miracles to deceive them in the
[57:37] last days and we'll succeed in doing
[57:40] that what
[57:42] after the seals broke so that's all I
[57:47] say to you you can say what you want to
[57:50] about the statements I've made the only
[57:52] statement I'm making you're gonna just
[57:53] have to look at it and believe what you
[57:55] won't do those three unclean spirits
[57:58] like frogs come out after the opening of
[58:00] the seals okay that's what he said got
[58:06] no argument all right
[58:08] they come out after the opening of the
[58:10] seals or are they now there right now
[58:15] deceiving the people of this message
[58:18] taking them straight to niceö Rome oh no
[58:24] they ain't taking us to Rome you don't
[58:29] have to go to Rome to be a Roman you
[58:35] don't have to kiss the Pope's to do PO
[58:37] to be a Catholic
[58:42] they asked the Pope but it's that time
[58:44] what about so that some of them because
[58:46] they think on our doctrine does not the
[58:51] world system how the same doctrine of
[58:54] the Catholic Church the Trinity but what
[59:00] about the people of this message over
[59:04] brother Dale they're not Trinitarian
[59:06] what are they they're tearing this
[59:09] message apart don't ever hand go on
[59:15] click it on the internet and see them in
[59:19] preach this message 4050 years and see
[59:22] what they're preaching now we were
[59:26] talking about this the other night at
[59:27] Terrance's I have never in my life been
[59:30] for afraid because I believe the
[59:33] prophets message didn't believe it's
[59:35] gonna take place but I'm looking right
[59:38] now at the worst deceptive point that
[59:41] and I've been at it for about a year or
[59:43] now or more of knowing the people of
[59:47] this message was turning so much against
[59:49] the message and I taught this in the 70s
[59:53] whether you believe it or not I taught
[59:56] in the seventies that it would not be
[59:59] the denomination's that would destroy us
[1:00:03] it would be right from among us
[1:00:08] I talked that in the seventies and and
[1:00:12] still believe it today
[1:00:13] you've got no problem with a Trinitarian
[1:00:16] concept of a doctrine with three unclean
[1:00:19] spirits like frogs come out from bat
[1:00:22] Dyer and brought in that Trinity and
[1:00:25] when the Prophet went off the scene an
[1:00:27] opening the seals what happened here's
[1:00:29] three unclean spirits like frogs coming
[1:00:32] back doing the same thing destroying
[1:00:34] this message
[1:00:42] what are we doing about it I've told you
[1:00:47] over and over in the 70s we had
[1:00:49] doctrines and questions and we had
[1:00:52] ministers meetings about brother Branham
[1:00:55] on his dates being wrong out in Colorado
[1:01:00] Arizona it's a day sometimes we had
[1:01:04] ministers meetings on that in the
[1:01:05] seventies talking about it but you know
[1:01:08] what the difference was you had the old
[1:01:10] people that listened and the old people
[1:01:13] said I don't give a hoot what day he was
[1:01:16] hunting because I remember telling them
[1:01:20] in the ministers meeting I said you've
[1:01:21] got bunch of gods think you've got
[1:01:23] something about her I said they changed
[1:01:25] into laws every day I said I'm a deer
[1:01:28] hunter I said they change the law I said
[1:01:30] I can just buy click of a pen put on
[1:01:32] another week of hunting I said I don't
[1:01:38] care but you see the older people
[1:01:41] withstood it and fought it and those
[1:01:47] young people that was coming in trying
[1:01:48] to produce and a lot of the oh the
[1:01:51] doctrinal issues wound up to be the old
[1:01:54] people of the message and when they did
[1:01:57] the old people that's turned against the
[1:01:59] message you said talk like that is it
[1:02:06] the truth are you going to be deceived
[1:02:10] by a bunch of illegitimate children of
[1:02:16] this message that are the old people of
[1:02:18] the message the biggest force of the
[1:02:21] whole people about dying off you're
[1:02:24] leaving it for the young ones
[1:02:27] they got nothing wrong with the young
[1:02:29] one if they'll stay with the truth
[1:02:34] they got her place as I've told you that
[1:02:39] it was up in Jeffersonville first time
[1:02:43] I'd went was 68 we was up there to the
[1:02:46] old was the guard buildings and things
[1:02:50] up there in that place and they were
[1:02:52] having a meeting you know I went one way
[1:02:54] brother bolt went the other way night
[1:02:56] awhile I come back around through there
[1:02:57] and I was just dying laughs and he said
[1:02:59] what is wrong you alive and I said well
[1:03:06] I said I went over here to these group
[1:03:08] of old men and they was all saying that
[1:03:15] you had to see brother Branham you had
[1:03:17] to know his moves his actions to
[1:03:19] understand what he's preaching and you
[1:03:21] had to see and if you didn't see it then
[1:03:25] you messed up and said and they were
[1:03:26] saying and these young people that are
[1:03:28] over here said them young people is like
[1:03:31] them it was 20 years and under said they
[1:03:34] didn't see Moses like we did I said I
[1:03:37] left that group and I went over to the
[1:03:39] other side
[1:03:39] got over here now with the young people
[1:03:41] you know what young people said them old
[1:03:45] people never crossed over the land and
[1:03:47] it doesn't go any Bibles tell you the
[1:03:49] old people didn't go across they got in
[1:03:51] the wilderness those it was 20 years of
[1:03:53] age and younger were the ones that went
[1:03:55] in to the promised land I said I don't
[1:03:58] know which one to join you know which
[1:04:03] group should I be in
[1:04:09] you see I see it more today

[1:05:09] make fun of that is to make fun of the
[1:05:11] Holy Ghost oh no that's no come on I
