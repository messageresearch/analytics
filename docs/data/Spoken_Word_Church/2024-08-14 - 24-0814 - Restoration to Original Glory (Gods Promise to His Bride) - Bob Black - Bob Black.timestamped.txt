[1:33] in the house of the
[1:35] Lord you can turn to your uh Bible in
[1:38] your Bible if you have it the Joel
[1:40] chapter 1 verse
[1:42] one and then when you're going to read
[1:44] out of Joel chapter 2 verses 25 and
[1:48] 26 um it's good to be back with you we
[1:52] had a real good time in Ohio at the at
[1:55] the camp up the true word Tabernacle
[1:57] Camp I I felt like um you know brother
[2:00] Brandon when he went when he went to
[2:01] that Pentecostal meeting that first time
[2:03] he was like I I want to be identified
[2:05] with these people um you know there's
[2:08] some people that you know they represent
[2:10] the what you believe in a in a strange
[2:12] way and you just don't really want to be
[2:13] identified with them but there's some
[2:15] people that you do want to be identified
[2:17] and uh when you get around people that
[2:19] are are are wonderful and you see the
[2:22] spirit of God being manifested just uh
[2:24] sure does make you uh make you proud to
[2:28] believe what you believe amen
[2:30] and uh so this morning this afternoon I
[2:32] want to read from Joel chapter 1 let's
[2:33] go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're
[2:35] so grateful to be able to gather around
[2:37] your word so grateful for that to know
[2:40] that your your spirit is still alive and
[2:43] moving Among Us Lord to make your word
[2:44] manifest and take it up off the page and
[2:47] make it a living reality and we believe
[2:49] Lord God that we're here to Manifest
[2:51] this word Lord in our lives we thank you
[2:54] God for the for your grace to us now and
[2:56] we just ask Lord that you'll show your
[2:58] grace to us tonight Lord be with us Lord
[3:00] Jesus to make these words real to us we
[3:03] ask in your name
[3:06] amen so Joel 1 ver1 says the word of the
[3:09] Lord that came to Joel the son of
[3:12] pethel hear this ye old men and give ear
[3:16] all ye inhabitants of the land hath this
[3:18] been in your days or even in the days of
[3:20] your fathers tell ye your children of it
[3:23] and let your children tell their
[3:24] children and their children another
[3:27] generation that which the pommer worm
[3:29] hath l left hath the Locust eaten and
[3:31] that which the Locust Locust hath left
[3:34] hath a cankerworm eaten and that which
[3:36] the cankerworm hath left ha the
[3:38] caterpillar
[3:39] eaten and then if we turn over in Joel
[3:41] chapter 2 he said I will restore to you
[3:45] the years that the Locust hath eaten the
[3:47] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[3:50] palmerworm my great Army which I sent
[3:53] among you and ye shall eat in plenty and
[3:55] be satisfied and praise the name of the
[3:58] Lord your God that ha dealt wondrously
[4:00] with you and my peace shall never be
[4:04] ashamed my people shall never be ashamed
[4:07] God bless you can take your
[4:09] seats I I as I was meditating on this I
[4:12] was just just thinking about um you know
[4:14] how the power of God is still alive and
[4:17] well and his people and and how that
[4:19] this this tree that's being prophesied
[4:21] spoken of here in this story The Bride
[4:23] tree that uh you know God's got a
[4:26] promise here that it's supposed to be uh
[4:30] it it it God saw that it would be in in
[4:33] fullness and uh grown up with all the
[4:36] bark and all the leaves and all the
[4:38] different parts of it that's spoken of
[4:40] here that these four four bugs ate down
[4:43] and he's got a promise here that he'll
[4:45] restore to us he'll restore to you all
[4:48] those things all those years that the
[4:50] cankerworm and so forth ate down but you
[4:53] know if you take a picture of what that
[4:54] tree really looks like it's got It's got
[4:57] all the the the the leaves and the bark
[4:59] and everything all up and and then
[5:01] you've got fruit coming out and so
[5:03] that's the picture that God wants us to
[5:05] have in our mind that God wants to see a
[5:08] church with fruit he wants to see a
[5:10] bride with fruit where the power of God
[5:13] is actually so visible in her that you
[5:15] can benefit not just from leaves and not
[5:17] just from the doctrine but it's actually
[5:19] God manifesting and pushing up like like
[5:22] a tree drinking uh from the rivers of
[5:24] water drinking up pushing up until it's
[5:26] just pushing out putting out pushing out
[5:29] a manifestation of the word and the
[5:31] power of God in their day and so that's
[5:34] what this is really speaking of that in
[5:35] this day is prophesied that he will
[5:37] restore where where all these demonic
[5:40] bugs ate down down through the seven
[5:43] Church ages that God is going to restore
[5:45] all that back restore all not not just
[5:48] the doctrine not just some little bits
[5:51] and pieces but fully restore it fully
[5:53] restore it back to the way it was
[5:55] supposed to be in the beginning and and
[5:57] you think about you know what's going to
[5:58] take for us to said take a Rapture full
[6:01] restoration means that restoring the
[6:03] bride back to her position full
[6:06] restoration means taking the bride back
[6:08] to where and the the the position that
[6:11] God thought of her in the from the
[6:12] beginning that if she hadn't Fallen that
[6:15] if all of this this sin curse hadn't
[6:17] have been existed and everything that
[6:19] that that that she would be uh walking
[6:21] in power with dominion over the over the
[6:24] Earth dominion over the uh the uh
[6:28] dominion over the weather dominion over
[6:30] uh sickness dominion over every full
[6:33] power and so that's that's the position
[6:35] that God wants the the bride to be
[6:36] restored back to and you know that's
[6:39] that's what we're looking for because
[6:41] we've got to come to that and when we
[6:43] come to that that's when the Rapture
[6:45] will take place you want to you want to
[6:47] know well what what is the secret of
[6:48] taking a Rapture and brother Ram said oh
[6:51] if the church only knew its position it
[6:53] will one day then the Rapture will go
[6:58] when it knows what it is
[7:00] and see we even you know we preach about
[7:02] what we know what we're trying to come
[7:03] to to to a place where we know what our
[7:05] position is where where we know these
[7:08] things we know on the on paper the place
[7:11] that we're trying to come to what we're
[7:12] supposed to understand but when we
[7:14] really come to that place and when we
[7:16] really the word being built up built up
[7:19] in our lives until until this fruit tree
[7:21] this this tree is built up to a place
[7:23] where it's actually bearing forth fruit
[7:26] and it recognizes its position and you
[7:28] can see is position and it's visible I'm
[7:32] talking about the power of God moving in
[7:33] the church then we will go in a Rapture
[7:36] and and it's it's kind of uh we got to
[7:38] be careful though when we're preaching
[7:40] these things that we push it we it's we
[7:42] have a tendency to push it off way off
[7:44] in the future but I don't believe it's
[7:46] far off in the future I believe that
[7:48] down Through the Ages God has been
[7:50] building us up building us up and even
[7:51] over the last decades and so forth until
[7:54] we're coming to a place and we are now I
[7:56] believe where the son of man is actually
[7:59] being revealed and we you you know last
[8:02] time we were talking about speaking
[8:03] about restoration that Martin Luther had
[8:06] a part to play in restoration and and
[8:09] his understanding of what justification
[8:10] was that John Wesley had the part to
[8:13] play when he preached sanctification
[8:15] isza Street on up until we get to Elijah
[8:18] the Capstone message to bring what is it
[8:21] it's that brid tree being being restored
[8:23] back to its fullness again and we know
[8:26] the pattern of restoration is there in 1
[8:28] Thessalonians 416 where it says for the
[8:31] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[8:33] with a shout now that's the message that
[8:36] brother random brought the message that
[8:38] went out and with the voice of the
[8:39] Archangel and that's when the bride
[8:41] begins to realize what she begins to
[8:43] realize what the message is talking
[8:45] about that's the voice of the Archangel
[8:47] and with the Trump of God and there's
[8:49] your body change so you've got that
[8:51] pattern with the Trump of God and the
[8:53] dead and Christ shall rise first so it's
[8:55] restoring God give us a message to
[8:57] restore our faith to to restore our
[9:00] faith and as our faith is restored it
[9:02] restores our character it restores the
[9:04] power of God in our life it restores the
[9:07] spirit working in the church again so
[9:09] that you've got like nine River nine
[9:12] nine fountains pumping out from the
[9:15] spirit of God to Bear forth nine
[9:17] spiritual fruits nine spiritual gifts
[9:19] all being displayed in the church now
[9:22] that's what God wants to see he wants to
[9:24] see the power of God being made manifest
[9:27] in you and I and that's what restoration
[9:29] is restore means to bring back to the
[9:32] former owner or to bring back to a
[9:35] former state of condition and if a claim
[9:37] is made on something to make that
[9:39] restoration you can enforce it to make
[9:42] it come back to its right place oh don't
[9:45] you love those strong words that brother
[9:47] random uses if a claim is made on
[9:49] something then you can enforce it now
[9:52] now you see that's the role of a
[9:54] minister in the church that when you can
[9:56] look into the word and see what your
[9:57] claim is and if there's somebody that's
[9:59] that's got a devil on them or somebody
[10:01] that's B in under the influence of a
[10:03] spirit or somebody that's in a sin
[10:05] condition you got a right to enforce
[10:07] that you've got a right as a mother or
[10:09] father when you get on your knees to
[10:11] enforce the claim you've got a right to
[10:14] enforce it and how do you have that
[10:16] right if you've got the token you've got
[10:18] the right to every promise of God if you
[10:21] got the
[10:22] token you think about brother R told
[10:25] this story about um you know ailec there
[10:27] in the Bible that that Abraham told his
[10:30] little phib and and gave his gave his
[10:33] wife over to ailec and there is Sarah in
[10:36] AMC's house and and God gave aimc that
[10:40] dream in the middle of the night and he
[10:42] came to him and said because of the
[10:43] Integrity of thy heart I will hope
[10:46] withheld thee from sinning against me
[10:48] and he said now therefore restore the
[10:50] man his wife and brother Ram uses that
[10:53] as an example of he he's he he he kept
[10:56] he kept Sarah he kept Sarah away from
[10:58] aimc he and He restored him back to him
[11:02] and restore means take back to the
[11:04] original he took Sarah and he took her
[11:06] back to where where she was supposed to
[11:08] be and that's what God is doing Us in
[11:10] this age he's restoring us back to the
[11:12] right mind to our right he's taking away
[11:14] our spiritual Amnesia he's restoring us
[11:16] back to the to so that we're looking at
[11:18] the scripture the right way he's
[11:20] restoring us back to where the spirit
[11:22] and power of God can actually move
[11:24] through Us in the right way now you you
[11:26] think so many stories in scripture of
[11:29] where the people were restored back to
[11:31] to a place where they were you know they
[11:33] left when they went down into Babylon
[11:35] they were restored back when the
[11:37] children of Israel went down into Egypt
[11:39] they were restored back they were
[11:40] brought back to their Promised Land oh
[11:42] you think about now that the state of my
[11:44] this is a lesson and state of mind when
[11:46] they got back Joshua placed them where
[11:49] they were supposed to be and that's a
[11:51] type of exactly what's happened in today
[11:53] the Holy Ghost is putting us exactly
[11:55] where we're supposed to be in God's word
[11:58] and you see we're all moved by The Same
[12:00] Spirit it's the same Spirit manifesting
[12:02] himself in different ways in us but one
[12:04] might be have a gift of wisdom and one
[12:06] might have a gift of tongues and one
[12:08] might have a gift of interpretations and
[12:10] on and on one might have a gift of helps
[12:12] and and different things but it's all
[12:14] God moving through the church and he'll
[12:16] put us into our positions and how is he
[12:19] putting us in our position positionally
[12:21] placing Us by the word oh and when you
[12:24] realize where you're that you're in your
[12:26] spot in your spot now I'm not talking
[12:28] about your job I'm talking about in your
[12:29] spot by the word the word placing you so
[12:32] that you're dressing right and you're
[12:33] walking right and you're doing right and
[12:35] you're living right and you got you got
[12:37] your Temperance and you got your virtue
[12:39] and you got your patience and
[12:40] everything's placed right and now you're
[12:42] placed placed like the Israelites were
[12:44] back into the Promised Land by Joshua by
[12:47] the Holy Ghost now you got Ephraim over
[12:49] where he's supposed to be and you got
[12:51] Manasseh over where he's supposed to be
[12:53] and then you see that solves so many
[12:56] problems because that's that's so many
[12:59] so many spiritual problems are caused by
[13:02] when we're not where we're supposed to
[13:04] be when we're not I'm I'm talking about
[13:06] the word now I'm not talking about our
[13:08] job now I'm talking about the word where
[13:10] we're not if you're not if if you're not
[13:13] in your soul if you're not born again
[13:14] right there'll all be something that
[13:17] ain't
[13:18] right and if you're not if you're not
[13:21] adopted there'll all be something
[13:23] something that you're battling out it
[13:25] ain't right but when God gets you right
[13:27] in your spot when God places
[13:31] you that's when that's when all the
[13:33] jealousy and everything stops that's
[13:36] when all the enmity stops you know I I
[13:39] think so many times that people will
[13:40] look at people will look at a real born
[13:42] again Christian or somebody that's
[13:43] living right and doing right and so many
[13:45] times the devil will rise up and his
[13:47] reaction will be well I hate that person
[13:50] that person thinks that they're that
[13:52] person thinks that they're better than
[13:53] me that person thinks that something
[13:55] else but you know what many times what
[13:57] it is is that that God has just place
[13:59] that person and they can't they can't
[14:01] help being a real lamb they can't help
[14:02] being a real Dove they are what they are
[14:05] they are what God made them and there's
[14:06] going to be baums and and judases and
[14:08] AMCs and all kinds of things rise up and
[14:11] poke and make fun but but you you are
[14:13] what you are and it's not because of
[14:14] something you did but because that God
[14:17] has changed you changed your character
[14:20] now there's a bride tree there's a bride
[14:22] tree I'm talking about where God pumps
[14:24] fills you with his spirit and he's just
[14:26] moving just just filling every fiber of
[14:29] your being until you can be like Jesus
[14:31] on the cross and everybody hates you and
[14:33] crucifying you and mocking you and
[14:34] scourging you and everything but you
[14:36] stand there and you you oh that's that's
[14:39] real Godly character when you can love
[14:42] the
[14:43] devil when you can love somebody that
[14:45] hates
[14:48] you my wife and I we had a little a
[14:50] little talk earlier today about how all
[14:52] the things that the devil can't
[14:54] do and you know the devil can't love
[14:56] brother that's what brother Ram said the
[14:59] devil can't love like I'm talking about
[15:00] real Godly love the devil can't bring
[15:03] the word by word which means he can't he
[15:05] can't manifest it he can't man he's
[15:07] always got to fake it everything the
[15:10] devil does is a fake so he can't love he
[15:13] can't but but God can love God can love
[15:15] God can love the devil God can love I'm
[15:18] I'm talking about not he he can like G
[15:21] you look at Jesus on the cross there
[15:22] when they were they poking him in the
[15:24] side and all those things but yet his
[15:25] reaction was father forgive him father
[15:29] father forgive them oh you the devil
[15:31] can't do that the devil can't do that
[15:33] but God can God can Manifest this word
[15:36] and that's the brid tree that I'm
[15:37] talking about that that the your purpose
[15:40] in life is to Manifest this word to be a
[15:43] to be a conduit for the Fountain and
[15:45] power of
[15:47] God and you see that I I was thinking
[15:49] about that story of the little African
[15:51] slave that when he when he come over uh
[15:53] and he knew he knew where he come from
[15:56] and he wasn't ashamed of it and see
[15:59] that's that's the position that God
[16:00] wants us to be is to not be all downtrod
[16:02] and have our head down and and where
[16:04] everybody's beating up on us but to know
[16:06] know and confidence where you come from
[16:09] and that's not pride and that's not
[16:10] arrogance to be confident and and like
[16:13] Ephraim Ephraim in his homeland this is
[16:16] my property this is where I'm supposed
[16:18] to be and manasseh's over there he's got
[16:21] his and manasse bless bless him he's
[16:24] where he's supposed to be you see where
[16:26] the Devil comes in is where you start
[16:28] comparing in yourself to the other
[16:30] person now that's where the devil gets
[16:32] in now that that's the definition of
[16:34] pride is when you start comparing
[16:36] yourself to the other person that is the
[16:39] definition of pride pride is when you
[16:41] say I'm better than that person or when
[16:44] you say I'm not as good as that person
[16:47] CU When you say I'm not as good as that
[16:49] person or I you know that person's got a
[16:51] little bit more favor or whatever then
[16:52] you start that you start get that's
[16:55] where jealousy starts coming in jealousy
[16:58] and enity where you're comparing
[16:59] yourself oh but God wants us to know to
[17:02] be positionally placed and recognize I
[17:04] I'm where I'm supposed to be I'm doing
[17:07] what I'm supposed to be now you see even
[17:10] even uh you we've SE we've seen that
[17:13] happen at at camps you know sometimes
[17:15] you go to camps and and that's where the
[17:16] devil really get in where these young
[17:18] people they don't have the Holy Ghost so
[17:20] they have no defense so they get there
[17:22] and they start compare and they're they
[17:24] know they recognize many times that
[17:26] there's something wrong in their in
[17:27] their life and in their heart but
[17:29] they'll see somebody else that they
[17:30] think has a little bit more joy than
[17:32] them and they start to hate them they
[17:34] start to lash out at them oh but if
[17:36] we'll just get if we'll just get our own
[17:38] house straight if we'll just get our own
[17:40] our own place in order and and then and
[17:43] then everything will take care of itself
[17:46] get get our own door swept and then then
[17:48] you can be like Ephraim or you can be
[17:50] like manasse and say well I'm where I'm
[17:51] supposed to be and that's where you'll
[17:54] find that you got real Joy real Joy
[17:58] comes I'm talking about Holy Ghost fill
[17:59] Joy is where God give you his joy and
[18:03] God give you his peace and God give you
[18:05] his comfort and then you can Bank all of
[18:08] your hopes and everything on him not on
[18:11] something that you've done not on
[18:12] something that you've got to do or not
[18:14] on your whether your friends like you or
[18:16] not oh that's where we get so messed up
[18:19] so many times is we'll we'll base
[18:21] everything on how many people like us or
[18:23] how many people B Pat us on the back or
[18:26] how many people how many people all
[18:29] those kind of all those external things
[18:30] but if we'll get along with God in our
[18:33] prayer closet and get along with him and
[18:36] get a relationship with God that's what
[18:39] we need that's what we need in our lives
[18:41] to get along with God and get things
[18:44] settled that way I think that's what
[18:46] brother R was talking about when he
[18:47] preached about desperations if we get
[18:49] desperate enough with God and say well I
[18:51] I want I want to know this God that I've
[18:54] heard preached about at camp and
[18:55] preached about at church on Sunday
[18:57] morning and preached about I want to
[18:58] know it for myself cuz that's the way I
[19:01] come I heard I I grew up in a message I
[19:04] had a minister the other day said well
[19:06] you were raising the message you never
[19:07] were out in the world and I said listen
[19:09] listen I had to find Jesus for myself
[19:12] just because you were raised in the
[19:14] message didn't mean that boom you just
[19:16] automatically were in come on you got to
[19:17] find God for yourself and I found him on
[19:20] my knees I found him like looking
[19:21] through the word for myself and I found
[19:24] him and that's where I get my joy from
[19:26] not because somebody likes me or
[19:27] somebody Pats me on on the back or
[19:29] somebody thinks I'm a good preacher or
[19:31] not a good preacher none of that matters
[19:33] but all the only thing that matters is
[19:35] what God thinks about me that's the only
[19:38] thing that
[19:39] matters and when you find that Joy you
[19:42] don't have to be ashamed of where you
[19:43] come from you don't have to walk around
[19:46] with a mock humility where well I I get
[19:49] I don't know I don't know you don't have
[19:51] to put on something you can be like that
[19:53] African slave and say I know who my
[19:55] daddy is I know that my Daddy's got a
[19:58] Cath cattle on a thousand heels I know
[20:00] where I come from and you know that'll
[20:02] give you peace and joy and comfort on
[20:04] the inside and you know the thing is the
[20:07] thing this is how the devil works if you
[20:08] don't have joy on the inside if you
[20:11] don't have a rock then you will lash out
[20:15] at other people and and why because
[20:18] there's something wrong on the inside
[20:20] and and you you're trying to get your
[20:22] joy from somewhere and that's what you
[20:26] that's always show love to people cuz
[20:28] that's why people act the way they do
[20:30] sometimes is they're trying to find joy
[20:33] and there's something wrong in their
[20:35] heart and they're trying to find it and
[20:36] many times they find it by trying to
[20:38] take it from somebody else they're
[20:41] dissatisfied in their heart and they try
[20:43] to take it from somebody else by putting
[20:45] them down or belittling them or calling
[20:48] them
[20:50] names bullying them calling them names
[20:55] cuz there's something lacking in their
[20:57] life and that ain't nothing to hate my
[21:00] friends that's something to love you
[21:03] ever see somebody that's that's in a
[21:05] spot like that you put your arms around
[21:06] them and you know in the Christian way
[21:10] and and show them love because they're
[21:12] looking for something they're thirsting
[21:14] for something and where are they going
[21:15] to find that from you where are they
[21:18] going to find that from the bride tree
[21:20] they they need that from the they need
[21:22] that from the they they're looking for
[21:23] the the shelter under the leaves of the
[21:26] brid tree they're looking for the
[21:29] rustling of the stirring of the wind
[21:31] under the leaves of the Bri brid tree
[21:33] they're looking for some of that sweet
[21:35] nectar some of that fruit to get that
[21:37] apple or whatever the fruit is off of
[21:39] that bride tree and and and partake of
[21:41] that and they're looking for you they're
[21:43] looking for what you've
[21:46] got
[21:48] oh pride is when you think you're better
[21:50] or worse than the next fell but if we
[21:53] can just be happy with how God made
[21:56] us that that's that's what plagues
[21:58] that's what plagues the church I we were
[22:00] up there and brother Josh Bennett he was
[22:02] preaching on do you he he said people
[22:04] asked me before when you hear another
[22:06] preacher preaching that does that make
[22:08] you jealous and he got to preaching on
[22:10] that he said no we're all on the same
[22:13] team look see because it's a it's a
[22:16] state of mind when you when you get when
[22:18] you get in your right place when you
[22:20] realize what God has called you for
[22:23] you're not basing your experience and
[22:25] your life on whether how you compare to
[22:27] somebody else
[22:29] how you compare to somebody El do do
[22:31] they like them more than they like me do
[22:34] they does that is that person happier
[22:36] than me they got a nicer car than me
[22:39] they got nicer clothes on and on and on
[22:42] they got they got more friends on social
[22:44] media they get more likes than me on and
[22:47] on and on and and that will torment you
[22:49] it'll be a torment to your mind it will
[22:52] grieve your mind but oh if you get along
[22:54] with God and let him take all that away
[22:57] it'll change everything change every
[22:59] that's what I I I that's why faith is a
[23:02] rock it's the rock that everything is
[23:05] anchored to and if if you get into a
[23:07] place get into a straight where you
[23:08] don't know which way to turn why don't
[23:09] you just let down that anchor until it
[23:12] can grip a hole to the Rock and anchor
[23:14] your life and anchor your life so that
[23:17] you're not movable by what somebody else
[23:19] thinks about you oh God if we could get
[23:22] away from that who cares what somebody
[23:24] else thinks about me whether somebody
[23:26] got more likes or more views them or
[23:29] this or that I want Jesus I want to know
[23:32] that I'm positionally placed in his word
[23:34] and that's where I am just be happy with
[23:37] how God Made You and the part of his
[23:39] word that you are predestinated to
[23:41] fulfill do you know that every one of us
[23:43] are predestinated to fulfill a part of
[23:45] his word every one of us here are
[23:48] predestinated to be to fulfill a part of
[23:50] his word you've got a part to play and
[23:52] I've got the part to play and the devil
[23:55] will get in and say well if you're
[23:57] fulfilling the part that I want then I'm
[23:59] going to be jealous of you and that's oh
[24:03] cast down all those imaginations cast
[24:05] down all that stuff but God is restoring
[24:07] us back to a place where we can have we
[24:09] can have confidence in where we are that
[24:12] now that's real Christian maturity where
[24:14] we're supposed to be he's restoring
[24:17] what's he doing he's restoring God is
[24:19] restoring everything that the devil has
[24:21] taken away he's restoring us back
[24:25] restoring us back to a place where the
[24:28] devil
[24:28] can't mess with us anymore that's what
[24:31] that's what God wants us to when the
[24:33] Devil comes to you and say well I I
[24:35] don't think you should like that brother
[24:37] I don't think you should like him I I I
[24:39] think you're better or worse all those
[24:41] kind of things cast that down and
[24:43] recognize it recognize that it's a trick
[24:44] of the devil and cast that
[24:49] down cast it down you know if you got
[24:52] joy you really want to give it
[24:56] away that's why when we GRE one another
[24:58] at church we say God bless you cuz
[25:01] that's a Christian's desire that God
[25:03] will bless you we greet one another at
[25:05] door it ain't just some some saying that
[25:07] we say we're we're grabbing each other
[25:10] by the hand and the brothers gra hugging
[25:13] each other around the neck and say God
[25:15] bless you because that's our desire
[25:18] that's sure my desire I want to see I
[25:20] want to see the church blessed I want to
[25:21] see people
[25:23] blessed if you're being restored you
[25:26] want to see your brother restored that's
[25:28] right if you're being restored if you're
[25:30] being brought up to a place of maturity
[25:31] you want to see the same thing for your
[25:34] brother so that's not that's what we're
[25:36] talking about this morning or this
[25:38] afternoon this tonight is we're not
[25:40] talking about reforming we're talking
[25:43] about
[25:44] restoration not reforming not patching
[25:47] things up but restoration all the way
[25:50] back to the way it was in the
[25:52] beginning to reform something means like
[25:54] if I got a car um my son-in-law Micah
[25:59] he's always working on his car he's got
[26:00] a truck that the engine just fell out or
[26:02] something and see that's what happens
[26:04] when you reforming it
[26:07] you you you're going you're going to uh
[26:10] go go on the internet and you're going
[26:11] to buy some souped up muffler or
[26:13] something or whatever it is I don't know
[26:15] nothing about cars but you're going to
[26:17] buy the the that that nice new Chrome
[26:19] thing and put it in there and then then
[26:21] you might be riding down the road like
[26:23] he was one time he's going might be
[26:25] listening and hear me talking about it
[26:26] walking riding down the road and all of
[26:27] a sudden part of it falls out and you're
[26:29] stranded for 6 hours what trying to fix
[26:32] it cuz it was reformed it's not restored
[26:34] it's it's patched up things are it uh
[26:37] you know the door might be painted a
[26:39] different color and and you you keep
[26:40] adding on and adding on and it's and
[26:42] you're you're making improvements you're
[26:44] making improvements but you're not
[26:47] bringing it back to the original you see
[26:49] that's why Martin Luther and John Wesley
[26:51] were reformers they were making
[26:54] improvements Martin Luther was like he's
[26:56] like I can't talk quite so much fully
[26:59] about against the pope like he still had
[27:01] those things about the pope and he's
[27:03] trying to improve the Catholic church
[27:04] and things he couldn't quite uh you know
[27:06] he got out of it but there was still
[27:08] some things that lingering the
[27:10] trinitarian doctrine and so forth he
[27:12] improved it but he didn't take it all
[27:14] the way back all the way back to the
[27:16] original and John Wesley improved it
[27:19] some more and theza Street improved it
[27:21] some more oh but that's why we needed a
[27:23] profit not to just improve it not to
[27:26] just patch it up a little bit where you
[27:28] might have a problem running down the
[27:30] road or something but he he took it all
[27:32] the way back to the very beginning to
[27:34] restore it and why did it have to be
[27:36] restored so the full power of God could
[27:39] work in the church and so that's what
[27:41] we're that's what we're looking for
[27:42] we're we're not looking for just just to
[27:44] know a lot of information but we're
[27:46] looking to see that brid tree restored
[27:48] that's that's my expectation I'm
[27:50] expecting the power of God in my life
[27:52] I'm expecting the gifts to be manifested
[27:54] I'm I'm expecting the nine the nine
[27:56] gifts the nine fruits and all all the
[27:58] different things to be manifested in the
[28:00] church cuz that's what restoration means
[28:04] full restoration means a return back to
[28:06] the original teachings of of Jesus
[28:09] Christ free from all of that influence
[28:11] of denominational systems full
[28:14] restoration means Act full access to the
[28:16] nine spiritual gifts that are manifested
[28:19] in the
[28:19] church healing prophecy all those
[28:23] things oh I'm I'm talking about I we we
[28:27] were uh Lily and Z were sharing with us
[28:29] how Lily's brother broke his arm broke
[28:32] his shoulder and the church prayed for
[28:35] him he had just had an x-ray that his
[28:38] his shoulder was just tow up I'm going
[28:41] to say it in the southern style it was
[28:42] tow
[28:44] up and and and they prayed over his
[28:47] shoulder and and it was healed God
[28:50] healed
[28:52] it now see that's returning back that's
[28:56] building up our expectation that that's
[28:58] what we should be expecting we should be
[29:00] expecting like like that Vision brother
[29:02] brandom had of the people going into
[29:04] that little room that when they come out
[29:06] their arms were restored their legs were
[29:07] restored whatever was wrong why because
[29:10] the power of God was restored back into
[29:12] the church full restoration means brings
[29:15] genuine Brotherly Love among
[29:18] Believers genuine Brotherly Love where
[29:22] you're not so interested in who's up and
[29:23] who's down and who's against you and
[29:25] who's for you but you love regardless
[29:28] and that's something my friends that the
[29:30] devil cannot do the devil cannot
[29:32] manufacture that the devil what what is
[29:35] it the devil cannot make the word live
[29:38] he cannot make he cannot bring the word
[29:40] word by word and he can't bring he can't
[29:43] manifest any of the things on this wall
[29:46] back here he can't manifest it he can't
[29:49] manifest love he cannot do it now he
[29:53] might be able to fake it sometimes like
[29:54] we know the story of the the kind old
[29:56] priest where he'll pay for for your your
[29:58] ticket he'll pay for your hospital bill
[30:01] he'll do all those things but brother
[30:03] brandham said if you go back and listen
[30:04] to how brother Bram framed it we don't
[30:06] we're not looking for a kind old priest
[30:08] but we're looking for the word to be
[30:10] manifested not just somebody to look
[30:12] like they're on a children's television
[30:14] show grinning and playing the banjo and
[30:17] that kind of thing that's not
[30:18] Christianity but we're looking for the
[30:20] word to be manifested the word to be
[30:22] manifested in Power full restoration
[30:26] brings a a position where faith in God's
[30:29] word is reaffirmed why cuz it's
[30:31] positionally placing you and full
[30:33] restoration brings genuine joy and peace
[30:38] genuine joy and peace where you're
[30:41] satisfied like the children of Israel
[30:43] that were placed in their Homeland
[30:44] you're satisfied with where the word has
[30:47] brought you and you can eat the old corn
[30:49] of the land you can eat and be satisfied
[30:52] with everything that God has given to
[30:54] you and full restoration brings genuine
[30:58] Divine fellowship and it brings healing
[31:01] through the rights given by Jesus's
[31:05] sacrifice because the scripture says by
[31:07] his stripes we are healed and it gives
[31:10] it brings power and authority over
[31:12] demonic forces in other words we ain't
[31:16] got to take nothing from the devil when
[31:18] the devil tries to take your joy and
[31:20] tries to take your peace you just give
[31:22] it right back to him because he has no
[31:25] power when Christ is here when full
[31:27] restor restoration is here so Resto
[31:29] restoration means to bring it back to
[31:31] who really owns it or to bring it back
[31:33] to its natural estate where it was at
[31:36] the first time bring it back into its
[31:38] natural
[31:40] condition brother Brown said in order to
[31:43] do this we have a right to
[31:46] enforce if there's a law to enforce this
[31:50] rightful condition of restoration to
[31:53] restore you you know what I think that
[31:56] means that that should give us
[31:58] confidence that when we go in prayer
[32:01] that God has given us a right to call
[32:03] for the restoration of our family to
[32:06] call for the restoration of our children
[32:09] now I think so many times we we just
[32:11] we're we're honestly we're slack about
[32:13] it and you know we we come and we hear
[32:15] preachers preach about it but oh if we'd
[32:17] really get desperate and really get
[32:19] sincere about it we'd find out that God
[32:22] would
[32:23] move I I can tell you so many times in
[32:26] my life you know raising raising
[32:29] children you'll find out that they start
[32:31] slipping and sliding and doing stuff
[32:32] that makes you grieved in your heart and
[32:35] and and it makes you come to a place of
[32:36] desperation and where you you've got to
[32:39] respond in faith and you have a right to
[32:43] resp you have a right to do
[32:45] that you and oh if we can have
[32:48] confidence when we come like Paul said
[32:50] to come boldly to the throne of grace
[32:53] knowing that he is the high priest of
[32:55] our confession in other words he's going
[32:57] to take take whatever we say whatever we
[33:00] pray in faith and he's going to take it
[33:02] like a priest behind the veil and make
[33:05] it manifest make it actually act because
[33:08] he's bringing our sacrifice he's
[33:10] bringing our sacrifice of praise like a
[33:13] high priestwood he's actually performing
[33:16] what we confess and so we when we
[33:18] confess in faith believing that there's
[33:21] a law that we can enforce by the power
[33:23] of the Holy Ghost it will go to work it
[33:26] will do what the word says that's what
[33:29] brother Ram said he said we have the
[33:30] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[33:33] claims that God give us you see we we
[33:36] get we get tied up sometimes we want the
[33:38] minister to do it for us or we want
[33:40] somebody else to have the faith for us
[33:43] but you can have that kind of Faith you
[33:45] can have that kind of Faith Like hadie
[33:47] Wright did that that caused her children
[33:49] to fall over her knees and receive their
[33:51] salvation it it is I'm I'm I'm not
[33:54] preaching a a hope so maybe I'm
[33:56] preaching if you believe it will happen
[33:59] that's the kind of faith that we've got
[34:00] to you know Peter he was sitting there
[34:02] watching Jesus walk on the water and he
[34:04] didn't I often wondered why didn't all
[34:07] the others stand up but Peter stood up
[34:10] and said well if Jesus can do it I can
[34:11] do it too and he stepped out of that
[34:13] boat and you if you look at scripture
[34:15] that way if the word
[34:18] says whatever you say brother R said God
[34:22] has a law and his word is a law and God
[34:25] in this word made certain claims to
[34:27] theur Church therefore we have a right
[34:31] to force these claims upon Satan say
[34:34] give it back and he has to do
[34:37] it he has to do it because we can take
[34:41] God's agent the Holy Spirit go right
[34:44] down on our knees and say it's thus
[34:48] saith the Lord he's got to give it up
[34:51] that's all because the holy spirit is
[34:54] there to make him do it oh you realize
[34:58] what that means is the Holy Ghost is
[34:59] backing up his
[35:01] word and when you come believing the
[35:03] Holy Ghost is there to back it up and
[35:04] make it
[35:06] perform so that means we've got a right
[35:09] to
[35:10] Salvation and you got a right to claim
[35:13] salvation for your
[35:14] children you we we've been studying on
[35:17] job how job was watching his children do
[35:19] all of their things and every day he
[35:20] offered up a sacrifice and you know you
[35:23] can go to go offer up your sacrifice of
[35:25] your incense of praise and worship and
[35:28] prayer over your children and it will
[35:30] actually influence them in their lives
[35:33] and and guide them but why because
[35:35] you're confessing and praying and laying
[35:37] your confession before God you've got a
[35:40] right to Salvation and you've got a
[35:41] right to Healing you got a right to it
[35:44] and the devil wants to take your rights
[35:46] away but this message and this gospel
[35:48] that I'm preaching is to take back
[35:50] everything that the devil's trying to
[35:51] steal from you if you're sick in your
[35:54] body or you're sick in your mind you got
[35:56] a right to take it back we've got a
[35:58] right to deliverance and we've got a
[36:00] right to Restoration and we've got a
[36:02] right to the Holy Ghost and brother R
[36:05] say the law of the land is to enforce
[36:08] and the law of the spirit is to force
[36:11] Satan to give up that which he has
[36:13] unrightfully deceitfully taken from
[36:16] God Souls of men he took from God Souls
[36:20] of women children sickness of the body
[36:23] he placed upon people but God made us in
[36:26] His image to be like him and the church
[36:29] is given the rightful legal rights by
[36:33] the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and
[36:36] enforce this upon them oh I think if we
[36:39] really would apply that scripture
[36:41] rightly we'd take things seriously when
[36:43] we got down on our knees in prayer
[36:45] believing that the things that we pray
[36:47] and the things we confess and the things
[36:50] that we say and do will actually have an
[36:53] impact because you got a right you got a
[36:56] right by the token of holy ghost that
[36:59] God has given to you you got a right to
[37:01] use it you got a right to use it like a
[37:04] policeman that says stop devil you can't
[37:06] come in here and tab my kids you got a
[37:08] right to do it you got a right to Dell
[37:10] the devil he got he's got to get out and
[37:13] where does it say in the Bible that the
[37:15] church is given the rightful legal
[37:17] rights it said it's in Genesis 1 12627
[37:20] God said let us make man in our image so
[37:24] you were made in the image of God after
[37:27] our likeness and let them have dominion
[37:30] so you were predestinated to have
[37:32] dominion over what over everything over
[37:36] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[37:38] the air and over the
[37:41] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[37:44] every creeping thing that means every
[37:46] serpent every every slimy slithery thing
[37:49] that wants to get in your house you are
[37:51] predestinated to have dominion over that
[37:53] thing it creepeth upon the Earth so God
[37:56] created man in his own image in the
[37:58] image of God created he him and male and
[38:01] female created he them and that is what
[38:03] God wants to restore to you he's trying
[38:06] to bring you back to a place where you
[38:08] have that kind of dominion where the
[38:10] power of God is working in you like that
[38:13] and you know it and and and that is your
[38:16] joy and that is your peace you recognize
[38:18] it and you know where you come from like
[38:21] that African slave and you know you know
[38:24] who your daddy is and that is your joy
[38:26] and your peace that nobody can take away
[38:29] from you God wants to restore that to
[38:32] you God is in the restoration business
[38:36] brother Ram was telling that story about
[38:37] how brother evans's car was stolen and
[38:40] and he said so we got down on our knees
[38:43] and he asked the question see see what
[38:47] power you've got that you might not be
[38:49] taken advantage of they got down on
[38:52] their knees and the Holy Ghost began to
[38:55] work and brought back that car that was
[38:59] stolen from them now what'll happen if
[39:01] you and I get down on our knees and
[39:03] begin to call out to God in faith not
[39:06] beg and you don't have to beg but I'm
[39:08] telling you what I believe in fellowship
[39:10] with God I Believe In Worship with God I
[39:13] don't believe in prayer as a mandate to
[39:15] your salvation but I believe in getting
[39:17] along with God and fellowshipping and
[39:19] worshiping and telling him that I
[39:21] believe his word and laying his word out
[39:23] where he can see I believe and saying
[39:26] God you said it now bring it to pass you
[39:29] do that and watch it watch and see if
[39:31] restoration won't happen just like it
[39:33] did for that
[39:35] car now he said now Jesus wouldn't have
[39:37] had to do that for he was the word but
[39:39] now we're not the
[39:42] word and you know in Matthew chapter
[39:44] 18:19 it says this is the prayer that a
[39:47] lot of times you'll hear the ministers
[39:49] praying over people when they come up
[39:50] for
[39:52] prayer if two of you shall agree on
[39:56] Earth
[39:58] now you think about
[40:00] this if two of you that means if me and
[40:03] brother Louise agree for
[40:06] something if me if you and your wife if
[40:10] there's a need in your
[40:12] home and you
[40:14] agree like brother Ram said he said that
[40:16] used two they'd get together on New
[40:18] Year's Eve him and his wife and they'
[40:23] grabbed each other's hands and they'd
[40:25] pray over the Bible that God will give
[40:28] them a good next year that God will be
[40:30] with their home and they get to pray and
[40:34] now it's just them two if just two of
[40:37] you agree on Earth as touching anything
[40:40] that they shall ask it shall be done for
[40:43] them of My Father which is in
[40:47] heaven why for where two or three are
[40:51] gathered together in my name there am I
[40:55] in the midst of them
[40:58] to
[40:59] agreeing oh you see what power we have
[41:03] that you've got a right to claim the
[41:06] promises of God and and don't cow down
[41:09] maybe tonight later on this evening you
[41:11] maybe these thing these words will kind
[41:13] of fall from your remembrance and you'll
[41:15] get all caught up in the world and
[41:16] caught up in how your children are doing
[41:19] but don't do that I I want you to really
[41:22] let this fall down like a rock in your
[41:24] heart when when things get rough and
[41:27] condition get all all around and you
[41:28] begin to wonder what's up and what's
[41:30] down and and you see your children going
[41:33] out in the world and different things
[41:35] don't forget that you got a right to
[41:38] claim restoration and and we ain't just
[41:41] repeating words in a dictionary we are
[41:44] we are speaking what God actually spoke
[41:47] and with confidence that he is going to
[41:49] take those things that we speak and
[41:51] perform them just like they did when
[41:54] they were calling for the restoration of
[41:56] brother evans's car
[42:02] and you do
[42:03] it with your husband or with your wife
[42:07] or maybe gather around your children
[42:09] around the coffee table and you call for
[42:12] whatever needs you have now if we'd
[42:14] start our day off like that if we'd end
[42:17] our day like that how much more
[42:19] fulfilling and joyful and peaceful would
[42:22] our lives
[42:23] be if we'd start off like the Bible says
[42:26] and brother Brown said what is it
[42:29] he said that Holy Spirit come upon that
[42:31] driver of that car condemned him and he
[42:33] turned around about halfway what is it
[42:35] enforcing
[42:37] enforcing you got to do
[42:40] it Satan you got to get out Satan you
[42:44] got to let go Satan you got to give
[42:47] in Holy Ghost is here to enforce see
[42:52] that's it he said that's what it's
[42:54] talking about restore it bring it back
[42:56] to its right
[42:58] owner and that's what the restoration of
[43:00] the Bride tree is all about restoring
[43:02] her faith restoring the faith of the
[43:04] Bride to enforce
[43:08] restoration we've got a right this
[43:10] morning or this afternoon brother
[43:11] Brown's saying this morning I'm just
[43:13] reading the quote to enforce the claim
[43:15] of
[43:16] God so if the devil took something from
[43:18] you take it
[43:20] back amen oh you think about all the
[43:22] things this sitting here this afternoon
[43:24] that the devil might have taken from us
[43:26] you might might be sitting here maybe
[43:29] you don't have any
[43:30] joy and and maybe you're maybe you're in
[43:32] that spot where you're trying to take
[43:34] joy from somebody
[43:35] else and and it's because the devil has
[43:38] taken your joy but why don't you take
[43:41] your joy back from him because you got a
[43:43] right to do it that's right how do you
[43:45] do it you get along with God and and let
[43:48] your faith go to work say I I don't have
[43:50] no joy but I want it and get along with
[43:53] God until something happens start start
[43:56] looking at at the word of God open up
[43:58] your Bible and just spend 30 minutes
[44:00] every day and start going through the
[44:01] pages and say I I I don't understand it
[44:04] but yet I'm just going to read it I've
[44:06] seen it have an effect in other people's
[44:08] lives and I'm just going to read it a
[44:10] and and and you watch something begin to
[44:12] take place read it with
[44:14] faith because we got a holy ghost right
[44:17] to enforce our
[44:18] claim that's right brother R say the
[44:21] only way that he can work the Holy Ghost
[44:24] is when you let him work you got to
[44:26] believe it
[44:28] That's the Law believe it and it will
[44:31] work believe it and it will work it will
[44:34] work how many times brother R said take
[44:36] the gospel medicine have you taken the
[44:38] gospel because if you haven't taken the
[44:41] gospel you can't say that it doesn't
[44:43] work if you take the medicine it's going
[44:46] to work you got to take the
[44:48] medicine he said verily verily I say un
[44:51] you he that believeth on me the works
[44:52] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[44:55] Works than these shall he do because I
[44:57] go under my
[44:58] father it's going to work you you think
[45:02] about so many promises in the Bible that
[45:04] are about the word manifesting in the
[45:07] hearts and lives of the people that's
[45:10] what the brid tree is about Greater
[45:12] Works than these shall you do that the
[45:15] works of Christ will be performed in his
[45:21] bride why cuz the law was in US
[45:27] yeah he brother Brown would he T us that
[45:29] a fish has got a law in him where he can
[45:31] go and he can go I I was looking at
[45:33] pictures of these deep sea fish you know
[45:36] the strange looking things that go down
[45:38] way in the bottom of the ocean way way
[45:40] down many many leagues down way down
[45:44] until pressure is just pressing in and
[45:47] and brother Brandon framed it up he said
[45:49] that there's a law in a fish like that
[45:51] that he can do that CU it's part of him
[45:54] that he can go way down and all the
[45:57] pressure and just you know they tried to
[45:59] do that with that submarine where they
[46:00] they went down and it just blew up on
[46:02] them so we we can't do that but the fish
[46:05] is made like that that where he can do
[46:07] that see he's got a law in him now if a
[46:11] law was in that fish to be able to
[46:13] withstand the pressure what about if
[46:15] there's a law in you that law that
[46:18] brother R's talking about the law the
[46:20] law to take back the law to raise up
[46:24] when it's down the law to restore
[46:27] he said there's a law in Christ and that
[46:29] law is in men you can bury them to the
[46:31] deepest grave or the deepest sea or the
[46:33] lowest tail there's a law of the spirit
[46:35] of God that will raise him up again you
[46:38] know there a law in birds that that some
[46:40] birds can climb way up high you look at
[46:43] we we were riding to church this
[46:44] afternoon we saw a Hulk up on the on the
[46:46] foam pole and there's all kinds of hwks
[46:49] around because we've got chickens in the
[46:50] backyard so there's always Hawks coming
[46:52] around and a Hulk can fly real high but
[46:55] it can't fly like an
[46:58] and brother Brown told us there's
[46:59] certain kind of birds you know like that
[47:02] that can fly is they'll just try to keep
[47:04] flying up up up but they get to a
[47:06] certain spot and they just can't go any
[47:09] higher but if there's a law in you
[47:12] that's comes by hearing the word for
[47:14] this age you can go just as high as the
[47:17] eagle profit because you're hearing the
[47:19] same
[47:20] word oh you find you find that even in
[47:23] in the gospel you'll find that certain
[47:25] people they're they can only go so high
[47:28] now that's a a horrible thing to say
[47:31] is't it sounds like a horrible thing to
[47:32] say but they can only go so high maybe
[47:35] they can go as high as being born again
[47:37] well they can only go as high as the
[47:39] virtues oh but God has predestinated Us
[47:41] in this age to take that that eagle
[47:44] anointing and soar up into the Mysteries
[47:46] and climb and climb and climb until the
[47:49] word becomes a living reality those
[47:51] Mysteries become a living reality to us
[47:54] and and and and the bride tree is rest
[47:59] restored in this age the spirit and the
[48:01] truth are here to bring full
[48:03] restoration full restoration back you
[48:07] know when the sun comes up in the spring
[48:09] every winter everything freezes over and
[48:11] everything gets Frozen and and it looks
[48:13] like there there's nothing there it's
[48:15] just death even nature testifies of
[48:18] restoration but then Here Comes the Sun
[48:20] and the shines its warmth on everything
[48:22] and you see that first Little Flower
[48:24] come up and it starts rising up and all
[48:26] everything that the winter killed in the
[48:28] sun restores it's the sun coming back to
[48:31] warm everything up and what does it do
[48:34] brother said it forces it to come back
[48:38] it forces it to come up the rising of
[48:41] the sun forces life it forces
[48:46] restoration and brother R would say it
[48:48] forces death in other words death's got
[48:51] to go when the sun comes it forces death
[48:54] out of the picture cu the Sun is there
[48:58] the nearing of the Son of God in these
[48:59] last days come into his church restores
[49:02] it back to life again and brother Bram
[49:05] would say he said God restores his
[49:07] flowers his leaves his nature his seed
[49:09] of the earth and therefore we know then
[49:12] that God will restore also his
[49:15] habitation he will restore his Eden he
[49:18] will restore everything that death
[49:21] killed that's right now the only way it
[49:25] can ever remain dead is let it lay in
[49:28] the wrong
[49:30] place but if it falls in the right place
[49:32] it's got to come back to life
[49:35] again so if we can just get in the right
[49:39] place oh God said everything all of his
[49:41] laws in motion that it must according to
[49:43] his own word it must work according to
[49:46] his own word his word his word is how
[49:50] he's he's he's restoring he's restoring
[49:52] the bride by his
[49:55] word and that's the reason the law of
[49:57] life was in
[50:00] Christ so I think brother Brown said it
[50:03] is time for
[50:05] restoration he said he planted a fruit
[50:08] tree he planted it on the day of
[50:11] Pentecost and he brought that tree there
[50:13] for a
[50:14] purpose you know what that tree
[50:16] represented it represented a tree with
[50:20] character a tree with the character of
[50:23] Christ brother Ram said in that early
[50:25] church age when that when that when that
[50:27] gospel tree was planted on the day of
[50:29] Pentecost they had all these virtues in
[50:32] there all these qualifications they had
[50:35] all those character that's what God is
[50:38] looking for he said this tree that God
[50:40] planted it was to Bear nine different
[50:43] kinds of fruit nine different kinds and
[50:46] I'm going to be closing here in just a
[50:47] moment he said which means nine
[50:49] spiritual gifts nine fruits of the
[50:52] spirit to go with the nine spiritual
[50:54] gifts that was God's tree he planted it
[50:58] in the Earth on the day of
[51:01] Pentecost I I thank God that that's the
[51:03] kind of tree he planted a tree that's
[51:06] not puffed up with how much it knows a
[51:08] pre a tree that's not trying to take joy
[51:11] from somebody else a tree that's not
[51:13] trying to poke or bully or prod but you
[51:15] know brother R always compared it the
[51:17] nature of Christ to like a little lamb
[51:20] that ain't got nothing to take but all
[51:22] it does is just give whatever it's got
[51:24] it gives and he compared also that that
[51:27] little lamb would be led by a dove a
[51:30] dove that it can't eat nothing rotten it
[51:33] can't eat nothing but filthy and and
[51:36] it's just we we were looking at out at
[51:38] the bird feeder the other morning and
[51:39] and Monica's got her little her bird
[51:41] seeds and all that stuff and those was
[51:43] two little doves come up and doves are
[51:46] so we were just got to talking about
[51:48] just watching how doves when they mate
[51:50] they mate for life it's two that they
[51:52] just stick together and both the all
[51:54] those other little birds coming around
[51:56] Cardinals and different kind of birds
[51:57] but here are those two little doves
[51:59] coming together and you could tell the
[52:02] nature of a dove just a little sweet
[52:04] little pure animal and it probably if
[52:06] you went out and grabbed it it'd
[52:08] probably just give its life freely and
[52:11] you know that's why in the old testate
[52:12] doves were sacrificed because it was
[52:15] acceptable to God it just it was just
[52:18] just a little animal willing to give and
[52:20] those animals a little Dove and a little
[52:22] lamb typify the nature of Christ and
[52:25] that's the kind of nature nature that
[52:27] God is going to have in his
[52:28] bride a little simple simple I think so
[52:32] many times we we get to think it in our
[52:34] mind that the nature of a Christian's
[52:36] got to be something else than what the
[52:38] Bible says but the nature of a Christian
[52:40] is got has got to match those those
[52:43] those types that were laid out here in
[52:45] the scripture just a little simple Dove
[52:49] just a little simple lamb a little lamb
[52:52] that was willing
[52:53] to like like uh Monica's always told
[52:56] those stories about her family when they
[52:58] used to kill the Lambs in the middle of
[53:00] the night and and they'd be uh there at
[53:03] the family they they wouldn't cry they
[53:05] just offer theirself up freely now
[53:07] that's the nature of a Christian the
[53:10] nature of a Christian is not to fight
[53:12] and fuss but to just that's why we don't
[53:15] argue over Doctrine we'll stand for
[53:17] what's right we'll stand for truth but
[53:19] we're not going to beat each other over
[53:21] their head over it because the same God
[53:22] that revealed what I believe is able to
[53:25] reveal it to you and it no matter how
[53:27] much we beat up over each other over the
[53:29] head about it it ain't going to change
[53:31] the fact that God has got to reveal it
[53:33] to you and God is God is the revealer
[53:37] god is the one that can reveal and so
[53:39] that's the the real character of life
[53:41] that is being built up in the church
[53:44] down through 2,000 years that's being
[53:46] molded and and through reformers until
[53:49] finally God sent a prophet to bring us
[53:51] back to the original Faith the original
[53:54] word that will produce the original
[53:56] character the same character of Christ
[53:59] that would stand for truth in the temple
[54:01] when he tipped over tables but also
[54:03] would say father forgive him on the
[54:05] cross when they struck him on the cheek
[54:07] oh that's what I want I want the the
[54:09] same life and the same character that's
[54:12] the same nine fruits nine fountains
[54:15] bubbling up pumping out the same love
[54:19] the same
[54:20] Joy the same
[54:22] longsuffering the same gentleness
[54:26] oh you think about what that means
[54:28] gentleness kind gentle gentle with one
[54:31] another gentle and
[54:34] longsuffering longsuffering patient with
[54:36] one another patient to wait for somebody
[54:39] that maybe wrestles with the truth that
[54:42] doesn't come to it immediately maybe
[54:44] it's they're looking for Joy so they
[54:46] strike out at other people but because a
[54:49] real Christian is long suffering they
[54:50] can deal with it gentleness and goodness
[54:54] goodness is that moral and integrity and
[54:56] the desire to always do good for others
[54:58] you're you're just want to do good like
[55:01] a little lamb a little Dove a little
[55:03] lamb or little Dove and
[55:06] Faith you just believe no matter if
[55:09] somebody strikes you on the cheek or
[55:11] somebody's rough and horrible with you
[55:13] but yet you just believe you just you
[55:15] keep coming to church you keep ride on
[55:18] cuz you believe a Believer is what you
[55:20] are and that's what you're going to do
[55:22] cuz you got faith and now those are the
[55:24] nine spiritual gifts the nine mind
[55:26] meekness humility strength under control
[55:30] you got an humble spirit and humbleness
[55:32] is not weakness but humbleness is
[55:34] recognizing like Ephraim or manasse I'm
[55:36] where I'm supposed to be I'm not putting
[55:39] myself above somebody and I'm not
[55:40] putting somebody myself beneath somebody
[55:42] but I just I just am what I am and I
[55:45] need God and you need God and and that's
[55:48] all there is to it and that's I'm just
[55:49] humble and Temperance self-control and
[55:52] those nine spiritual gifts what is it
[55:54] it's the character and the nature of
[55:57] Christ God wants us to have character he
[56:00] wants our character to be on display he
[56:03] wants us to be like
[56:05] him and as we close the musicians come
[56:08] forward that's what the scripture means
[56:10] when it says he shall be like a tree
[56:12] planted by the rivers of water that
[56:15] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[56:18] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[56:21] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that
[56:26] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[56:29] and brother Randon would say there's
[56:30] been different seasons it's the season
[56:33] of the message for your day when you
[56:36] hear the word for your day you manifest
[56:39] the fruit for That season you're
[56:42] actually manifesting it and so what is
[56:44] your fruit your fruit is the word that
[56:48] you've heard actually manifested in your
[56:51] life to produce the same character of
[56:55] the word that you you've heard there it
[56:58] is nine different Springs feeding into
[57:01] him and there you've got a real a real
[57:05] powerful real Christian Church that's

[1:04:30] not have seen all the things that God
[1:04:32] did for the Indians and Venezuela but we
[1:04:34] look back in our life and just be
