========================================

God bless you Saints it's good to be back in the house of the Lord it's it's it's been a while since I was uh been almost a month I guess and uh but I I sure I want to say I sure appreciate everybody that um took this spot over the last few weeks and I sure appreciate all the messages that were delivered and uh we sure appreciate each and every one of you I'm getting an amber alert um it's asking me to subscribe all of a sudden hold on let me see if I can all right sorry about that y'all just bear with me okay let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord around your word and as we study these things out I pray Lord that you'll bless your people and Lord edify them build up their Faith Lord give us something in the hour that we're living in Lord to help us along life's way be with the services today I pray Lord that you'll just bless brother Wade as he's ministering Lord Brother pageant bless bless brother Louise this morning Lord and we just ask your blessing upon the service now in your name amen now we've been kind of studying on Hebrews chapter 11 and and getting into verse 12 but I I kind of wanted to take just a little detour I've been thinking about some of these things that I I'll bring out today I just wanted to meditate on you know it you the only way that you can please God is to have faith and and there's things that you do if you disb believe God's word and and act out of turn and things like that and it Grieves the Holy Spirit now you know when we come together and we gather around gather together in this little assembly this morning you know really our main objective is to is to be pleasing to God and to do things so that we we don't do things that are that are Grievous to the holy spirit because we want we want the service and we want the songs that are sung and the words that are said and everything our actions and our deeds and the things that come across the pulpit to be pleasing to the Holy Spirit now Paul in Ephesians chap 4:30 we'll kind of study out a few scriptures there in Ephesians 4:30 Ephesians chapter 4 where he said in verse 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption so we can take away from that there's a lot of things that you can do that that can grieve the holy spirit of God even after you're born again now if you study these things out before you're born again there's things that you can do to grieve the Holy Spirit and you know you uh he would and we'll we'll kind of study these things out and as we go through some of the slides but it's very Grievous when we don't when we don't believe what God is saying across the pulpit when we don't believe what uh what the message is in it when he said you can grieve the Holy Spirit until finally your soul just kind backs off and you're not listening to that to that still Small Voice anymore until it becomes fainter and fainter and your your heart becomes as like in in the Old Testament says your heart begin sealed your conscience becomes seared over as a as a as as if it was seared with a hot iron and you just don't hear anymore why because you've grieved away the Holy Spirit but now after the Holy Ghost after you've been born again you do things just in your conduct and the way that you act that Grieves the Holy Spirit you know things can go wrong that's why there's deacons said in the church Church you know keep you know keep children from running up and down the aisles and so forth like that because you want to set the atmosphere so where the Holy Spirit has feels at Liberty to to do things to move and and to impact your life now brother R would say in the Israel in the church he said seal till how long because this verse is saying don't grieve the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed so you're sealed you've got the Holy Ghost right you've been born again you've been born again and now you can do things that are wrong he but saying he's trying to stress the point seal till how long grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption not from one Revival to another but until the day of your Redemption everlasting life just isn't a little space of time Everlasting is eternally forever can't die no more than a grain of corn could become a Cocker and if a man's born of the spirit of God is automatically he lives the life y all think about that now is if you're born again again it's going to be automatic that you live the life automatic now of course you're going to you know just like a little baby growing up it's you're going to trip and fall and do things but as you grow up you the little things that that maybe a little child will deal with as you grow up and become an adult you're not dealing with the same things anymore those things get worked out now but you so you're you're grieving think of Jesus looking at us like a little child growing up and and to grieve means to suffer you know any parent can look at their children and see things that were I I wish they wouldn't do that a little child getting playing with their their tricycle and they get get to getting too close to traffic hold don't do that and you start yelling at them get out of the get out of the road or as they grow up they start talking to the to the getting in the wrong crowd and everything and it becomes Grievous and and you see Jesus is kind of looking at he God is looking at that with the same same kind of viewpoint I guess you'd say he's like a parent and and we can do things that cause him to to grieve and grief to grieve means to suffer grief to feel grief for because of to cause great distress to someone and you know if you really break it down to grieve the holy spirit means to engage in behaviors or attitudes that are contrary to God's Will and character to to do things that are wrong or to think things that are wrong to behave wrong or to have the wrong attitude the wrong attitude when we come to church or when we're just going through life and we're doing things the wrong attitude and that Grieves the Holy Spirit brother R would say in the position of a believer in Christ he'd say quote it for the sake of time grieve not the holy spirit of God and he'd broke it down he'd say by your backbiting back by talking about people behind their back saying things that to kind of stir things up by your carrying on now if you really break down what carrying on is and that's that's kind of something hard to Define what is carrying on well the internet says carrying on means to just act foolishly you know just just just uh behaving in a way that's like you know you know what it is when you see it carrying on indifference not not really caring about not I think that's one of the worst things to see in in Christian Christian Christian people is indifference where you just don't really care anymore you just you're you're not really engaged in the service anymore you're just kind of going through checking off your your Sunday services and you don't really oh to think about now that that that would grieve the Holy Spirit to to see somebody not really caring anymore you know what the ministers are preaching about growing in maturity and the stature of perfect man and the blessings of God and the promises of God and people just get indifferent well it's just the same old same old and and then another way you can grieve the holy spirit is by your unbelief to see the promises of God and all the access all the things that you can have access to and here brother Rams make statements like we're living beneath our privileges and yet we fail to believe the things that that God has said grieve not not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption now now that's a powerful scripture because you're sealed to the day of your Redemption your soul is sealed you're born again but you can still do things that are Grievous to the Holy Spirit and to see Jesus brother Ram said as you come lady he's talking to somebody in a prayer line come believing and and I I just want to talk about how the the nature of the Holy Spirit CU he's he's in this prayer line he's say he's telling his sister come un believing don't have any doubts in your heart for if you are just a little suspicious now think about this if you're just a little suspicious the Holy Spirit cannot and will not if you're just a little suspicious it's it's a very timid being now you think about the nature of the holy spirit this morning is if we we want the Holy Spirit to feel welcome in this Sanctuary we want him to feel welcome in our lives but the Holy Spirit the nature of the holy spirit is very timid amen he's not going to just come kick the door down and just barge in and say well I'm taking over anyway you got to let him in you got to you got to you got to you got to have the right attitude and the right Behavior he's he's he's going to back off and pull away if if if if you know you're not just treating the sanctuary right if if if the conditions are not right if he detects any kind of unwelcome attitude then he's going to pull back why cuz he he's very timid the holy spirit is a person it's not just some kind of a spooky thing floating around or something it's a person it's the person so a person has characteristics and likes and dis dislikes and the Holy Spirit does not like unbelief it doesn't like all the things that we just read about foolishness and and carrying on and and uh all all of those things and being led by the spirit brother R said but whatever I say now do just as I tell you for it isn't me when the anointing strikes me I don't even know until my brethren play a tape and tell me what I said so you see it's so timid the Holy Spirit just the least little thing Grieves it now think about that just the least little thing Grieves it be real reverent and Jesus will come to you if you're all excited he can't come to you see be reverent and believe now to think about that how you can be pleasing to the holy spirit is to be to think with a with a same sound mind to think on the Lord to to to be conscious of that you want fellowship with God to be to meditate on his word to be reverent to be sincere you you'll know every every single time this brother brand would move up all these three stages of grace to the next level the angel of God will come and tell him to be more sincere what I need to do be more sincere be more sincere because the holy spirit is very timid and you're not going to get anywhere with the Holy Spirit if you're not sincere and re re and and looking at things in the right with the right attitude and the right Behavior not not wanting to carry on or not do do something irreverent but because we don't want to grieve the holy spirit so when we come together around the word of God we want to have a a a church service that's pleasing to the Lord we want to have our lives in order so that we're pleasing to the Lord our every footstep every thought is pleasing to the Lord so that we don't grieve the Holy Spirit now if you want to find some examples of G in the Lord you can go back to Ephesians 4 of course there's a lot of examples in Corinthians and all through the scriptures but where where Paul says this in Ephesians 4:30 back up a few scriptures and he'll lay out some good examples that we can take take note of of of how you can grieve the Holy Spirit and in verse 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another now you know reading some of these Scriptures it it you getting down to the where the rubber meets the road but but you know these are things that I I think are worth kind of studying out and meditating on that that Christians are truth bearers now you think about this now we're talking about grieving the holy spirit that if you don't bear the truth if you say something that's that ain't quite right it's going to grieve the Holy Spirit Away the holy spirit is very timid so it's not going to like that Christians are called to be people of Integrity honesty and truthfulness now you go all the way back to the verse verse one in Ephesians chapter 4 and Paul says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with you are called in other words every aspect of your life should be trying to line up with what the Holy Spirit the way that he wants you to live to uh be truthful with one another be honest with one another uh try to try to you know if you promise somebody that you're going to do a certain deed for them on the job or something you you do the very best that you can of of course in all aspects of your life but espe espcially dealing with one with one another CU we're brothers we're brothers and sisters in Christ and here's a good one and the skipping on down a couple of verses from 25 to 27 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath now you know we're talking again about grieving the Holy Spirit anger anger by just by itself it and inherently sinful there's there's probably a lot of reasons that you could here's some good good examples of when you can get angry Ry and and you might be right like you you find out your kids hadn't done their maybe you're homeschooling your kids and you find out they hadn't done any lessons in like three or six months or something and of course you're going to naturally get a little bit upset what do you mean you hadn't been recording your work or uh you know I'm I'm going use Zach for an example he was telling us yesterday that he was on the job and the guy working the ship before him hadn't fill the G put gas in all the trucks so naturally you're going to be up actually if you wen't a little upset something something will be wrong God don't want you to go through life like a robot and like not get upset when like you know your your your family's not living right you you ain't you ain't doing right the people on the job ain't doing right so anger and you'll find we'll find a few examples in scripture here where where Jesus got angry the Bible says that he got angry so anger in itself is not inherently sinful but when you when it gets out of control oh when when things begin to get out of control see there's nothing wrong with get angry angry at your children for not doing what they're supposed to do if your kids don't don't uh don't show up on time for their job and then they get fired of course you're going to get angry but when you cross that line and you start railing on them and saying you're stupid and worthless and something something else begins to take over that's that's so what's what's taking over what's in control you know uh you can kind of compare in Mark 3: 1-5 when Jesus entered the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered ham and he and he healed him and and and they got all upset with him and he he said unto them is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man straight straight forth thine hand now look at look at Jesus in this case he was angry at them because they did not believe that they got so wound up because he was trying to heal somebody on the Sabbath that they didn't even see the good that he was trying to do so naturally he got angry with them he was angry and not furthermore he was grieved why was he grieved for the hardness of their hearts so there's another example of where you can grieve god with your heart's all Stony and you just don't you just you just don't care so much anymore oh that's what the gospel was given for to take somebody that don't care and and soften up that heart but start changing them start start uh when you begin to realize how much much God loves you and how God wants to woo you and and do something with you and do something with your life it it'll uh it'll change that old Stony heart into and soften it up now talking about anger so who who really is the one in control on the left we got a picture of Jesus in the temple was striking out at all the animals and the people and everything because they were they turned his turned the temple into uh a den of Thieves that turned it into something where they were just interested in money but on the right you some got some people that just have lost control lost control who's the one in control now just kind of call out that that image on the on the left is if you've been paying attention to artificial intelligence lately I I generated that from a computer that is a fake image can you believe that that's completely generated by artificial intelligence and this one too so don't let this anger don't let the sun go down upon your wrath and this is where you start to grieve the Holy Spirit is when when you just get angry so angry that it starts taking up root in your life and you start getting bitter with one another and it starts growing up into something that's why the Bible says in that same verse Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath don't allow it def fester and grow into a grudge or unresolved conflict if you got if you're angry at your spouse don't wait till tomorrow to get it resolved uh I I I've got uh over this is maybe too much information but over my wife and I bed we have a sign that says don't forget to kiss me good night because we want to get all the problems resolved if there's any any fights or anything you get the problems resolved and every night before we go to bed we've got that sign over the bed it says don't forget to kiss me good night because uh it's because of this scripture don't allow things to fure and grow into a grudge don't carry unresolved conflict into the next day don't let anger linger and poison in relationships and handle your emotions in a manner that honors God and promotes healthy relationships with one with others why cuz if you don't if you're angry with somebody you got something against somebody if you don't deal with it right then then it might be 15 years later and you hadn't talked to that person in 15 20 years and you you oh you you just let you just let the devil tap dance all over your life you just let the devil run the show don't don't let things grow until they just get out of hand until until it becomes a problem greater than when it started amen be angry and sin not and of course of course we're all familiar with the scripture in John Chapter 2 or Jesus I was just referring to he went into the temple and and uh made a scourge of small cords and drove everybody out of the temple and and in verse 17 it says his disciples remember that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up now brother Brown would often quote this scripture when he's talking about deacons in the church because sometimes you know know deacons have to you you know there's a time when you you you want to be nice and sweet to everybody but there's a time when you got to do like Jesus here and and as he rose drove everybody out you got to you got to get a little bit rough if if uh if things aren't going right you know you got to straighten things out let's read through through a few other places in the in the Bible where anger anger you want to be sure that your anger is well placed in Proverbs 14:1 17 it says he that is soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated in Proverbs 15:18 a wrathful man stirreth up Strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife and I I I'll post these online I'm not not going to Bel the point you can read all these scriptures in your own time and verse 28 says let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor were working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth what are these scriptures are for I'm reading about that there's things even after your new birth that you can do wrong that can grieve the Holy Spirit and God wants you to God wants you to not not be a thief but to to work for what you earn to to uh and verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and I think there's there's a real for something that'll really cause the Holy Spirit to draw back when you say a little joke that you don't need to be telling or say something a little bit crass you know sometimes we'll we'll get in that mode where we we well I'm just going to skip over that let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth engaging in Gossip or spreading malicious rumors using foul language profanity or derogatory terms promoting or discussing immoral behaviors that that sort of conversation has no business in a Christian's mouth discussing immoral things things that things that you're not supposed to things that the world that's the world what the world's doing encouraging harmful or destructive actions towards oneself or others engaging in sexually explicit or inappropriate discussions that violate God's design promoting violence all those things are corrupt communication and Paul's saying now so there's the scripture if anybody ever ask you where does the bible say we're not supposed to cuss you can take them to Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth that your conversation is supposed to be holy that the words that you say and the actions that you that portray or everything's supposed to be holy brother R would say on backsliding now see these are things that uh we're talking about a born again Christian he said on backsliding I wish somebody would go to ask me that but on backsliding remember you backslide every day every day we make mistakes every day we do things that that are Grievous to the Holy Spirit we need to repent of but see those things are more when you're a baby and grow less as you mature there's no way at all for you to keep out of of out of it but you backslide to the people in the church but not before God see you backslide on Christ but you don't on God cuz when you sin you're gone but you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repent rep all the time so we don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit I'm going to skip over that you know we we should be conscious of the Holy Spirit what the Holy Spirit likes and what the Holy Spirit doesn't like like Elijah in that cave listening to that still Small Voice when the holy spirit says you've done something wrong aren't you glad for that that little twinge when you said something wrong to somebody I've heard people say I say things to people all the time and I never feel bad about it boy I do I I feel sometimes I say something and harsh to my wife or my children and I you just got to apologize I I think that's the mark of somebody that's coming close to maturity when you can get down and say I'm sorry or or or you know some there's a mark of something really Supernatural taking in place in your life when you feel bad because you've done something listen to the Holy Spirit when you grieve the Holy Spirit turn around and make it right when it says you got to make something right or when you says you need says you need to do something differently or something's off oh you listen to it but when something's listen to that Holy that still Small Voice when it says something's off kilter when those when those guys start coming around talking to your daughters or or vice versa the girls there there's a still Small Voice that'll tell everybody something's off and you listen to that listen to that still Small Voice cuz it's there for a purpose and back to where we started from and and the message testimony brother Brown said when you move or stir it just shakes me now now you think about brother brandham saying this and and how close he was with God and how should we look at the Holy Spirit and and the way that we live he he would he would say I lose the anointing so quickly and he would say the holy spirit is very timid how many knows that very timid and the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he would say now don't do that see you're moving around he said I'll have to stop stop first thing you know my son will be beating me on the side brother billya will come on and pull on him and tell him it's time for him to stop preaching and that means go see be reverent just be quiet just for one more will you then we'll just ask them to lay their hands on one another when you get up like that it Grieves the Holy Spirit and I and I gets away from me and I can't control it see because he Grieves and he leaves me why why would the holy spirit cuz the holy spirit is so timid now you think about this morning in in the church Church the holy spirit is so the Holy Spirit doesn't want to be in a building where people are indifferent where they don't care about the service where they're not engaged where they're not listening where it's just something else where they can check it off their list the holy SP Spirit do want to be in a building where people are not believing where they're not wanting to be there oh but if you want to be there then the Holy Spirit wants to be there too amen oh you think maybe maybe this is a little bit hard I can I can kind of tear about by the Expressions on your faces maybe that you're pushing back a little bit but the Holy Spirit wants to be where he's welcome and if you welcome the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will come now we can think we'll meditate on that this morning if you want the Holy Spirit to be active in your life Welcome him if you want the Holy Spirit to be active in the church and moving welcome him and don't do things that grieve the holy spirit because the holy spirit is very timid the holy spirit is very timid God bless you Saints than
