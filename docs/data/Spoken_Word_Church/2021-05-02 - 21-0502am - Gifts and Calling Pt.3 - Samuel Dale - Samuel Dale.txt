you and we've fought the battle been through great trials and things and come now to the point of ending it all up because we're in we've got to admit we're in the last days i mean that's not not something to say well we don't know about the answer about that but we're in the last days we're winding it all up and we just thank god for the opportunity to know where we're at and what's taking place it's good to see everybody that have sister tootsie back with us you've seen her come up out here you know i mean her legs broke crushed and everything in the book and she hadn't been out just a little bit but we we kept trying to offer her help to come up the thing and and we wound up thinking we were going to have to help sister freda instead of strategy because mr tootsie just walked right straight up that ramp and come right on in and and got everything uh you know inside and she didn't want no help so that's a good way to do it that's a i like to see that i like to see the spunk you know if you you say i'm not gonna just do this i'm gonna get up and go and work on it amen and it's good to do that we we just appreciate it and you know now remember the uh let's see uh starting now next this coming sunday coming up we will be starting with the sunday school classes downstairs you know the children the things okay not wade's class but boys all the others all of them are going to do and now and we're going to uh wait a week because white's going to be gone ministering but you know this coming sunday now that will be the same thing 9 45 you just don't come up or anything like that and whatever then just go right straight to your your classes and things and all the sisters and things will have everything set up and ready for you to enjoy the services and then the next weekend we'll have it set up to pull in and boyd will be able to go into wade sunday school class giving him more room and it'll be you know based on that and we'll be having the sunday school class up here for the adults okay the ones coming up here will be the sunday school class and we're going to rearrange the services just a little to where that we can fit it all in and we get it all fit in and then it should flow right straight in that the sunday school class will be here upstairs wade wade's class or ever if when he's out or something wherever who's doing it we'll be up here for the morning service and then flow right on into the ministering and be able to uh we should be able to go and basically just the the ministry side of the second part you know which would be say if i'm preaching that day it should flow right straight in to worthy between 11 30 or at least 11 40 whatever i mean 10 excuse me 10 we will uh flow into the evening service and shouldn't have any problems of uh of doing it okay so we're going to try to get that fixed up to where we can have everything better because we don't have enough room downstairs i mean we're sorry if we just don't have the room to be able to put you in this place or put you in that place we just don't have those to do all right and it will be being announced heavily this month about the june time for the uh vacational time for the sisters and for the brothers so we'll be doing that it'll be good you get everything ready get it all in motion and get everything turned to to do now i'm going to say this i don't want to be aggravating about it but uh we brothers we get our set and we just let somebody take care of it and it's all done we don't have no arguments about where we're going to stay and what we're going to do you ain't got no choice when you walk in the room to decide what bed you're going to sleep in you grab the first one you can get a hold of you know and you just do everything you can because we just don't have any trouble uh maybe we were to send some of the uh maybe one of the men along to direct the women but you know i'm i'm not throwing off on you now sister you know i mean you want to eat here you want to eat there we just want to eat i mean it don't matter to us if we got to go down to mcdonald's and get a hamburger we're going to eat you know but if we can we'll go up here and have this whatever you call it london broil or whatever that thing low country broil you know we always have that and you know if you don't like one part of that slide it over i'll eat that you eat your side of it we're gonna we'll take care of it sorry about that sis but it's truth you know just don't argue with each other about what's going on okay because brother long and his son will be here for that weekend uh ministering for us on that and the lord willing uh they're not here but brother luis will be ministering lord willie wednesday so just remember that and uh getting everything kind of in order to where that we can can uh do any other announcements white announced he wants to meet downstairs in the evening after the evening service with the uh song leaders the deacons the uh ministers we're going to try to get everything in order that we can get to where it all works and flows without having any trouble in that okay if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading from romans 11 and then we'll go to ephesians 4. yes we are having communion today now we still will not have the foot washing we will hold off on that for another a little time we we kind of flow into everything we can gradual to where that is not uh you know not causing difficulties but we do thank god for taking care of us and and guiding us about to have danny back with us because he he got to blunt into the deal joyce and them they wound up with small amounts well that's still okay you you you get hit with it it's rough it ain't no small thing it's a rough thing but then god will just take care of us and bring us through we appreciate it okay all righty father we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for everything and we ask you to just be with us now as we go into the service and we pray that you would bless each one and guide us in your understanding keep us in your love that your life might shine into our hearts be with each one of those the ones that are sick remember brother owl our lord having a lot of problems and weaknesses and things lord and just just touch him and bring everything out of it and all the others brother house mr audrey and and all the ones just to clean the lord and for brother colley brother dougherty we we pray that you would bless them and sister mary and and all and just just let your loving grace be with us remember those that are not here with us today and all out traveling and and things and all and lord just let your loving grace be with us all we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen all right we're reading from romans 11 29 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance all right now turn over to ephesians 4 for the gifts many plural many gifts but only one calling because make your calling and election sure see we're all involved in that but yet we have different gifts you know different gifts in in our doing and we appreciate all of that but we're just trying to cover what those gifts are and then try to relate it down to uh finish it up and i hope we can get far enough to if if not if you listen to last night's uh bible study i mean i'm saying i had a good time i enjoyed it it was good to to be able to sit down and talk and and let you listen and me do all the talking no i tried not to do that but but it just gets hung out so you ain't gonna sit there and say all right who's next well 45 minutes later who's next now we're going to do something if we have to get up and dance or do something we're going to do something for a time instead of just sitting there dead and and all of that and just have a good time fellowshipping together is what i like it's wonderful for all of us to be able to come into the building and just sit down and just have a good time i thoroughly enjoyed that and we just pray the lord would bless okay let's go to ephesians 4 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ all right wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that's psalms 68 verse 18 that says almost verbatim word the same there because it was a from back there promising looking forward to the new testament and paul picks that up in his is telling you that what it all about and he relates back to that and says well now this is what the word is saying back there so wherefore he saith when he led when he ascended up on high and led captivity captain gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things and he gave his the gifts he gave gifts he ascended he brought the gifts the ascending and descending brought to pass the part of the gifts could come into being of the holy ghost coming on the day of pentecost the gift of the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts and things etcetera as we try to cover all right so he gave some apostles and some pastors i mean it's been prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity how long is this to be till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ let's stop right there and just you may be seated and we'll pick up because while you're being seated i want to go to uh one more scripture that uh you know see it says over here that he gave some apostles some prophets some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers all right now my point of emphasis to you now for your look if you won't do i don't have this for them but if they want to grab it and see if they can get it up but would be in the the corinthians uh let's see 1228. and what i want you to get out of this point is that he's not laying in order which one is greater than the other he's not saying here in the things that you could say well now wait a minute it says apostles first well that may be over and i think that's right same in corinthians it says at first all right but he's not necessarily making a definite statement of which comes first because i don't believe now i'm as straight as i can be i don't believe that there's any difference in the ministry in the body of christ now i'm talking about the fifo ministry one is not greater than the other now it may be that one brings the word in a greater measure but so what as long as we get it the main thing is us to get it the main thing is for us to to come to a position of understanding and that's what we read in ephesians till we all come to the unity and you go over in peter in the statue of a perfect man but see it doesn't use the word stature but i can read it don't you paul picks it up here and he lays it into a growth development understanding unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ seeing he he brings that into order but now let's look at first corinthians 12 28. let's see if i can get it right all right now 27. now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god has set some in the church now he said it in the church we're going to read a lot today uh irregardless of whatever we're going to read a lot where brother branham talks about that the fifo ministry is the offices offices of the holy spirit see then that way one's not no more valuable than the other one is just as important as the other all right but think about it now and god has set some in the church now who said it in the church he says over here that he gave some apostle some prophet some pastor some teacher okay and god has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers now watch him that's not a threefold ministry you know what i'm saying it's a fifo ministry but he doesn't name the other two but he names them why because he says early teachers after that after one two three then you've got miracles then gifts of healings governments diversities of tongues but he said are all apostles or all prophets or all teachers or all workers of miracles have all the gift of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but he said covet earnestly the best gift that you show shall yet show i unto you a more excellent way what if it's in jesus christ all right now so what we've been doing and and i'm sorry but i found out a long time ago to quit being sorry for changing your message and bring it because it's always something there and and i've had the last couple of services we've had company coming and going in and we love that i'm not saying nothing i say that it gives an opportunity i say they were sent to make me back up and relate again something that you that was here didn't get it now that's as serious as i can because i've watched that for for 50 years in the ministry so you you come in you've got a preacher and he comes up and he's struggling in a message he's struggling like everything and and man he said man i tell you what i don't know where's anybody getting anything out of what's saying today because i ain't getting much to myself you know but then you go outside and somebody says i caught something well you know what what you said well lord i would have loved to come out with that great glorious anointing that i had the week before you know that i could run the aisles and i can do but this one just seems to be dead well it might be god is using that to make it work any way that it's done we honor glory to the gift gallery to god who does all of this so all right now you understand what i'm saying then see paul to the corinthians there were some of them arguing who was best who was first they must have been because he said now are all apostles or all this or all that but he just simply names off to you apostles prophets teachers he doesn't go excuse me he doesn't go in and call the pastor you know and all like that but yet he does because he says and helps and governments and and this and that and the other he's naming those gifts but he's not doing it into one after the other we want to argue yes but brother dale i found over here because you're always saying this is and i found over here where the bible says it well praise god but does that make anything out of it you know paul is express expressing what we have need of is all of those gifts all right and i believe fully in a five-fold ministry i don't believe in a one-fold i don't believe in a four-fold or a three or two but as wade was bringing out there the other day of frank you know the brother branham come i've always taught you that brother branham came as we would call it outside of the fifo ministry not outside that he was somewhere else no he could fulfill all of those ministries anything of the fifo ministry brother branham could fulfill that because he was the prophet of malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 said you said well you don't think i can do that but around no i don't worry about it i know you can't i know i can't quit trying to be something that you're not just be what you are and it'll fit right into the body of christ and everything will be perfect all right what's been our goal so far what we've been talking about paul said the gifts and calling of god are without repentance the prophet said you don't repent to get a gift you remember what he said the first thing he remembered at 18 months i don't remember what i'd done until i was four or five years old how about you any of you remember anything that happened when you was 18 months old he i think i'm pretty sure that's 18 there's an amount of months right there he said first thing he remembered was a vision he was crawling across the floor picking snow off of somebody's shoe that had walked in and he saw the point about the bridge of following the things you know when they're arguing you see prophets are born prophets moses was born with a special gift brother brown said he had the word from his youth why because his mother taught him you are not the son of pharaoh's daughter you are the you are the you're the direct descendant of abraham coming down and that's your people that's out there until one day it finally rose up in him enough until he started defending his people and killed that man you know see because he realized who he was he didn't have to wait you you get it in the ten commandments they do the best they can and i thank god for all of that but you get in there and they had him like 40 50 years old when he finally found out who he was and then they run him out of each read your bible they didn't run him out he ran out of himself because remember he went back out the next day and one of the the israelites or jewish people said he was correcting them you know and they said you're going to kill us like you killed that egyptian well he knew right then he was out of there he prepared to leave because he knew what had happened had been exposed and he couldn't do it so that's what i'm saying you do the best they do the best they can in the movies and the things like that but most of the time they do it to try to attract you know they they claim what is it uh everything has to be in movies now especially nowadays in what you call it sections of of like it's only two or three minutes then it changes because your human mind locks in at on two or three minutes and stops but if you change the scene real quick and make something real drastic happen ever say 10 minutes or ever what time it would be i don't know i just heard this but i realize that's what they're doing they're changing that to make you hold your mind not you're going to go to sleep especially if you're 81 years old but you see they do the best they can thank god for it but we we we'll take what the prophet said and believe in that and then he knew from his youth who he was what did he come for his mama told him daily because she was taking care of him okay let's go on with it all right now we started out explaining that gifts and callings of god are are calling on god are without repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're born with it all right now don't get all involved in it take it as i try to explain it step by step because if not you say well i got the holy ghost before foreign born into the world then because i got the gift that's that's not what he's talking that's not what your prophet is saying when he said he was born with a gift he was born with natural gifts natural abilities to do things right that other people don't have it's gift all right see that don't make it to baptism of the holy ghost i tried to explain that you have gifts you have gifts to be able to understand if you have to if you have the new birth today and have the gift of knowledge you had that gift back there but it was in a different form of knowledge maybe not working of god because when you come into christianity you begin to start using that gift that was in you all the time i don't see where there's any problem to understand that but it gives the foundation to be able to say well wait a minute the prophet didn't say this the bible don't say that and you don't get all flusterated you know things you know you go step by step and study things out and think about it think about what your prophet said we were talking about it last night brought around and said i can conclusively prove that you are born again and baptized into the body you take that one little quote and you can make him miss the entire bible unless you understand what he's saying and he said now the new birth is a difference than the baptism well see settle down and listen to what he's talking about take the illustration he always gave he said everything is made known by what illustration before and after everything will fall into place by before and after then you can see what you're dealing in the middle all right and that's what i'm trying to get you to see that's what i've been dealing with the fact that see you had gifts you had things you knew things in your life you were coming up maybe you didn't think about it in the christian realm you didn't think about it in in those terminologies because you were not supposed to but you you were just born a little different i told you i was a sinner and go out and do things of the world and come home and and sit down and feel dirty and feel uh like repenting and and whatever see a lot of people say well i think people tell me well but when i come back i wouldn't i was happy well you see you're not getting it right around said some people are just born different there's just something different about you then you look and you finalize it and you bring it all the way over into your new birth and you bring it up in through the statue of a perfect man and you find out that that was a wonderful thing that you know that you could that god could do those things through you and you're a sinner he don't beat us to death for being i mean for for sinning he beats us to death for being stay in a sinner because we need to get rid of it all right well see that's what i've tried to bring up brought that and then we moved up from there to where that you can really see the the gifts and calling the and you bring it into the new birth and you see that god through the new birth he can activate your life and and things of where you had just the little things in your life that you might see something and you might be a little different in school and we were talking to a sister about it that you can you know you could be and people could run to you for for advice and do different things well see that you take that in the natural but then when you get born again god can activate that he doesn't have to give you another gift the gift is eternal life because that's what the bible says the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ all right you don't have to give you another gift you're born with a gift see whatever you have today in the line of christian boo doing singing worshiping playing music doing or preaching or whatever see that gift was there but it was just in a form to be not being used maybe you would call the terms of it but then when the holy ghost comes in he starts to do it and then you got the the nine spiritual gifts and look what you've got in the nine spiritual guests you've got love joy peace goodness meekness all of that over one part then you turn over on the other one and you've got the uh the ability to discern the uh speaking in tongues and all kind of things in the nine spiritual gifts that you can have and god could come down during that and the prophet was so wonderful to explain and he said he could use you in that line he could use you one time he even said a a preacher could be could be trained for whatever 30 years or something one thirty minute sermon or something some some normal just a small thing because it's it's what he's got he gave you the gift now wait a minute you're getting it too far okay now hold the point what are we all dealt in predestination so don't run off the deep end think brother dale's dumped us now and he's trying to bring something else down stay with me gifts and callings of god are without repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're born with a gift well i was born with eternal life now wait a minute you gone too far now you stepped out of the bounds of the bible well you said i was born with the gift that was not a gift of the new birth you wasn't born with a gift of the new birth you got to be born again all right see that way you put it in line so when you come into the new birth then you see how that god starts doing like uh let's see uh one of them i've got in here where brother brown said there moses was of all of the things but said one five minutes at the front of that burning bush was worth more than all of his teachings and knowledge he said because dire is where he was anointed we see you got the new birth you may have had a gift of discernment you may have had a gift of being able to understand this that or the other but then that needs to be anointed so it was anointed and put into action then you see it really working in higher realms all right because that's the nine spiritual gifts but in the nine spiritual gifts even the the prophet will cover and i've got them right here if you want me to read that part to you to make sure that in the nine spiritual gifts they are for the perfecting of the signs no no i brother dale i i finally got what you're saying the bible says it's a fifo ministry for the perfection of the sign now you're trying to tell me something else well hang on might tell you a lot more down the road but see when you come into getting the new birth it activates the gift that you already had paul's saying what was the unistro where there after well lois said you know paul said when you're the gift that was in you from your grandmother or something lois well you don't lay on hands he didn't go over there and say now wait a minute lois we got we know you've been this all your lifestyle we're going to take off you can put over over here no no no no it's not none of it is that away see it was to lay on hands to activate that's right yeah why do you lay hands on ministers to send them out to first show others that you're behind them in the ministry of what they're doing but others is to show that that you are you are uh uplifting that gift and honoring that gift that god has given you all right but seeing if i in the nine spiritual gifts god can use you and then not use you again okay that's what your prophet said and see then you can see that there's things that can happen in your life that you realize you were different all right let's see that new birth when it comes into you it activates that gift for god it converts it over from where you was using it for the devil and makes it over into working for god amen all right and see those nine spiritual gifts works in the the body of believers wisdom knowledge templars patience all the statue of perfect man all of those different things that you start reading they're in the local assembly and everybody's there subject you realize what we're talking about life's not on the point of it you ever thought about then you ta what are you going to do with nine spiritual gifts what are you going to do well a woman ain't allowed to do this out of the other now you done walked off the word sorry you done went out on your own limb because woman is allowed to speak in tongues interpret she can have prophecies she can have those signs see in the nine spiritual gifts it don't define between male and female and the operation of gifts it deals with gifts because the sister can can tell you something if you listen to her i like brother woodbury's way of saying it years ago he said that old woman up here in tennessee scrubbing on washboard said she'll tell you something if you'll listen to her say this she's got the new birth she can tell you something this thing ain't just thrown off for the man you know he does all of the things no that's what i'm trying to get you to see in the nine spiritual gifts you show it to me in the nine spiritual gifts that's in the local assembly and god can use those things men are women now you move up to the 5-4 ministry out she goes she can't fit in there why because it's a different part deeper part of what's taking place more is happening more is required all right see then in the 5-fold ministry it was so amazing when i began to run little thoughts just to think about what was the prophet talking about and to come back to see how many times he used words like five ministering gifts then he'd talk about those gifts and he talked about an office you're going to have to think a little bit now because you're going to get yourself involved with a with a building with a door in front and i'll call that an office and that's what webster says right but what would be an office in the spiritual realm paul didn't say come on timothy walk in here in my office no before timothy stood the office paul's standing there he was the office of god who used the word office in a different form of your mind instead of thinking about office being a building with doors and windows get it into what it's saying there because it's nine spiritual gifts but five offices huh do you understand you got this at work so much you got this it works so much you got this at work so much and you got this over here that everybody's trying to take brother branham's office stay out of that office i don't care how many doors you got or what you're doing stay out of that office because you'll get yourself in trouble with god in a hurry of trying to do it that way you're following me on what i'm trying to get you to see i'm trying to keep it so simple until to me it's it's it's uh boring to have to keep repeating to people but i learned a long time ago that that's most of the time as i say it a while ago about it that's most of the time when people are really getting it when it seems to be so boring then until it's just amazing and everybody has gone to sleep or gone to water you know it just seemed to be the whole thing now there is some points where you can get so far and sleep but you don't remember nothing but we won't go that way i don't i haven't uh heard anybody snoring in the services maybe you have but you know you'd be like oh brother maloney i used to get tickled at brother maloney well brother schrader was he's bad to go to sleep and he he snore just a little and [Music] my brother maloney by the time he he'd get a couple like that will run them along every door an old brother straighter yeah and put his arm around brother maloney and just hug him up you know and there he'd woke him up well okay yeah seem to get you to life and then when you get people to life and they're at least paying a little attention so i'm going to add my point i fully back what wade said the other day about his bathroom deals now and to prove it worked and nobody went in the bathroom last service i'm just telling you knife church see i'll try to get your life to where you can open up and then you won't sir up on me and kill the rest of the service just remember the prophet said you will give an account for everything you've done and said if you hinder one person with your doing then you'll be responsible that's right well no no no no brother dale you mean we can't go to now nobody didn't say you couldn't go to the bathroom that's where you holler and scream and talk about no nobody didn't say that it says to be nice and comfortable and do you got to go to the bathroom go the housekeeper don't want to clean up poodles in the church but when you just run it and running and running brother brown said a child running through the church would hinder the next service and he said you'll be held accountable no come on if we're held accountable for what we're doing i don't want to hinder nobody else and i'm 81 so you'll see me going to the bathroom before i come in here because that's one of them things you're going to have to go the older you get the more you're going to go so we're not doing that but i'm just telling you i'm standing behind it now i'm behind the rules and regulations of the church and it set forth and i believe you should we wanted it to anyway why would you want to hinder anybody well my little darling your little darling has got them little little little eyes as we call them the doggy eyes you know the little things where you want to pet the little doggy you know and then he bites the daylights out of you but uh okay all right we've done that i got that done so i can quit but listen see then you go from natural gifts to a place of nine spiritual gifts that puts you in the body and begins to work in a realm with god in his ways and then you've got a five-fold ministry and all of these nine spiritual gifts has got to be judged right but even in the five-fold ministry they've got to we judge but our judgment is what the prophet said it's not a judgment of the congregation to decide whether it's right or wrong i mean if you ever get to the point you think you can straighten the preacher out then be careful you might be right but you might be wrong well who are you arguing with see that's the serious part of it we're we're not playing church you know you know for brother dale you'll run people off ain't never run nobody else preaching the word has never run nobody off i've had a lot of people get them walk out yeah but i used to say it and i finally got where i just quit saying and i said if you're going to leave don't slam the door you're going out at least be quiet get up and walk out and go on go somewhere else and do whatever because we ain't built this church on the basis of trying to make people come to church or threaten you because you don't come because you're just a hindrance to me and i'm a hindrance to you if you're not in it brother brown said find you a church that's got a god-given pastor and stay behind it i'm going to say something but it's going to be another week or two to get to it but you know brother around talked about that pastor morning did anybody now we're talking about the 5-fold ministry i invite you to study some in the next few weeks he talked about this pastor more than anybody he said he's the burden barrier now he didn't discount all the rest of them no no no he put their office and gave it right but he put the pastor in the office he says he's ordained to carry you through now watch so we got to get it right he's ordering to carry through if he's ordained well i don't have no trouble quoting that i don't have no problem with quoting the life part that's the before and the after i got it right it's an honor to be a pastor of a church it's an honor but the other four ministries should honor that ministry as to where they're supposed to be and realize what god is doing he's in charge he doesn't have to give an account except now listen wait a minute and i mean what i'm saying the 5-fold ministry gives an account to the prophet's message of how did he bring that but they don't have to give an account to the congregation as to what they're doing oh [Music] brother dale you'd be better off if i'd beat you i'd be better off you know i'd been better off a long time ago if i just quit and let it go but it's too late now i'm sorry i just you know it's just too late i'm i'm trying my best to save your soul and that's what the profit you want to hear it let's see if i can find it i'll run it off while i go anyhow your pastors are dying to lead you through he watches after your soul now here's what we've said we've got to get it in order if you had one ministry greater than the other you have a trouble in the fifo ministry so what did i say to start with he named it this away he gave some the apostles pro he named it over here maybe in a different form of lineup than it is over here but to me he's saying not one minister is greater than the other but you show me where there's any of the ministry because that teach that that pastor sure teacher could bring a greater depth of word but he'll bust the church wide open the evangelist oh he's good but he'll run the people off and the poor old pastor has to sit there and put it back together right so now who's in charge who's got the greatest of all the gifts okay because he's ordained to carry you through but you know what sorry to say it pastors don't believe this statement but they have got to have a pastor i've discussed this with the fivefold ministry people you know what a lot of people have said i've discussed it in ministers meetings they said i'm a pastor i'm a just who do i pay tithes to i can't pay it to myself oh they're really smart you thought about that you ever thought on those lines who does a pastor play tithe to you know back in the old testament the only one that was allowed to receive the tithe was the high priest then he divided it down to the rest come on get in the bible and talk with me about it the high priest was in charge of all of that because he was the pastor and then he driven it down there's a lot can be said we'll try to get it try to keep you from being lost in what's being said to where you could understand that doesn't make the pastor greater no that's why paul said he said i'm the least he said i'm the chiefest of all sinners what about a man so great like that until his word was just the power of god was behind his word but yet to him he didn't think of that what do you think about look at brother branham no wonder he could be a pastor i had a sinner tell me something one time and i thought it was a pretty good point he said don't get between a man and his wife when you're discussing things said set off to the side because you're in trouble because they're going to get together and you're going to be the dirty dog now you tell me that's wrong you want to go to some of these places and let them tell you about it don't get between a man and his wife you you're going to get in trouble because you're going to say to her well i think you're and i you know i'm thinking and about that time they're going to both quit talking to each other and they're going to go they're bringing and they're going to get you they're going to be after you this old fudge went through some holes in the wall to find out a lot let people tell you all about it and then let them decide have you ever noticed a word that they said about brother branham that he was the only man that was ever seen that he made you up he lifted you up that was an honor that he would lift you up and him being one brother said he said me and bill said we decided this right here wasn't right in the bible i said forgive me i'm stumbling around because when he said me and bill decided i learned real quick bill was sitting there letting him just run his mouth and after a while he said brother you go do it this way if the brother had any sense at all he'd go do it the way he said it i'm getting into ministries and things like that but listen when you come into the fifo ministry you come into offices gifts or offices it's not a pastor can pass out of speaking in tongues or shouting or crying or any kind of a gift to you that's laying on the hands brother and said i don't agree with that he said that's where i differ with those brothers that you can't lay on hands to pass out gifts but says you can lay on hands to activate the gift that is in the person and thing right but when you say i'll give you a gift we need to go up there because brother dale i heard he can give out gifts well boy that'd be pretty good i can't give you nothing but the word of god then you're going to make up your mind what to do about the rest of it because a a minister is a an officer as i said surely we're past the point of thinking about an office as being a a building with walls when you're talking in spiritual offices it's it's a situation or a positional point that is valued in line or are looking at it as to be the thing that it should be in in the line of christianity it has nothing to do with an office building or anything like that uh you go over to banks county and you go to the sheriff's office well sure yeah we know what the sheriff's office right you go over and say where's the sheriff's office it's right back there three doors down well sure that's right that's right that's his office but then you turn back around and say where's the sheriff he's fulfilling his office today because he's down at the courthouse in atlanta bringing the case against so-and-so that's his office he's the one ordained to do that now you can see why brother brown says it's your pastor he's ordained to carry you through if he's ordained and hey i don't mind quoting i love to quote he said if your pastor won't stay with the truth finds you one that will i have no trouble saying that you don't agree with me the way that i preach and what i do find you another church but i will quote some more brother brown said you have no right to leave a church unless there is a doctrinal issue now i couldn't i can find that for you but you want to know it unless you got something and that pastor's off the word well i don't like him well glory that's good i mean god's going to change the whole world to fit you i don't like you okay but let's listen to what he's saying about these things go ahead and we'll start with number one i will read some of these today every service i said we've had these same notes for four this is third third message and we've had these same notes i just go back and say you know this is the same notes but look what brother brown said on jesus christ this time yesterday and forever now before you could do it see now god does that then he sends people into the church such as preachers teachers evangelists gifts of healing don't mean the man now can heal you it means that he has faith in what he's talking about and all that proves the bible and that all right after that there's prophets that seers all those gifts and without uh repentance that god sent to that the office that's what he said office gifts god sent to that office gifts are sent by god they're for ordained of god office gifts now see your gift if you have a gift it was foreordained before the world ever begun god knowing what you would receive but now come on i don't mind i can quote it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but it's the word of seed but to remember everything comes before knowledge predestination of everything comes before now watch it now office gifts are sent of god for ordained of god and they're set in the church they're born in you them traits are born in you when you come to this world you just find your position now i spent all that time describing how god activates a gift and activates it that's exactly what he's saying you just find your position find out what god wants to use you for and he'll take care of it he'll he'll do it okay go on with christ and all those things are in the kingdom of god and all of it's for the perfecting of the church and to bring it together so all of the whole thing is for the perfecting okay go ahead to the next one number two this is from the message service we would see jesus so when jesus came on the scene the bible said he was to be a prophet moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like and unto me and israel always believe their prophets because that was god identifying himself in human flesh you just think what a prophet was always any bible scholar knows that that's the way he identified himself was in his you know excuse me we flicked off and we'll just read from there because we're going to back it up we all know that there's local gifts now watch him look how brother random defines things local gifts in the church but there is offices of the church see women can serve in local doings of the church but not in the pastor not in the preaching right because that's in your nine spiritual gifts god can use you sisters but just keep it to where you're going and say don't say well i know i'm preacher cause boy i tell you what i said that and it happened no see once but there's offices now there's local gifts of nine gifts in the church local gifts but there is offices of the church and that god that's predestinated or for ordained god has said in the church apostles and prophets and teachers pastors and evangelists and so forth that's god's gifts set into the church then there's nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body and of the believers and they must be checked by two or three judges now they gotta do it but not not this minister up here watching before they're to be given to the church because you know sometimes they could be wrong but notice these prophets as they were born like i believe in jeremiah here god said what before you was ever conceived in your mother's wound i ordained you a prophet over the nations but brother dale that just gets so much into me because i can't see the difference between the man and his office that's what brother brown says you you're doing wrong he said to try to define the difference between the seventh angel you've got to get it straight but if random stood before no one that was the whole message the other day to prove he stood before no one he stood before god right i don't stand before the congregation but i stand in the point that the bases that i've got to line up what i'm talking about with that prophet and if i don't then i am guilty of schism well don't you think brother brown was a little off right here that we need to straighten that out you've never heard that out of this man you've always heard one thing before an icer will take care of it just get into the message and study it okay listen because watch now we're just conceived in another ordinary a prophet over the nations you see moses was born a prophet and john the baptist 712 years before he was born he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness isaiah the prophet speaking of him see it's not these gifts are born gifts god placing them in the church offices fifo ministry gifts from god offices that god sends brother branham was above offices that was sent wade read that now the church age book the word you take the church ages and you bring them all down and each one of those church age messengers was god to the people all right let's see where you're going to fit brother branham because he said he was not the messenger to lady osea the holy ghost came himself 464 the old syllable the holy ghost came himself on the day of azusa street and then you got the ministers of this message got the audacity to say that azusa street was false or was not right of god you look at me i can call names don't do it with me just take the bases to realize we there's one thing about it is brother dale said it he'll he'll stand behind it as a man stood in this pulpit right here that i had already corrected him in the meeting we was having and he said azusa street was false and he said it where we were eating at and i confronted him in and said brother branham said well he come right here and he said zeus street was false of course everybody in the congregation 90 of the people believed him because he couldn't preach aero come on church what are we getting into let me go ahead go to number because i want to try to get these go to the next number three now if you believers how many believers is here i could not do it i cannot bring him it takes all of us together to do it i'm just a part of him and you're a part of him but if you're sick and needy i'm your brother and god sends in the church now there's nine spiritual gifts goes in each local body which is tongues interpretation and things okay even the prophecies and so forth but there is the five predestinated offices of the church what is an office like i said you realize that to use the sheriff you realize that we're they've kind of done it but you realize in my day when i was a just a kid you know the sheriff had so much authority to but it was something he was full authority man everything went his way or it didn't go he'd go shoot you and they just didn't do nothing with him because he was the sheriff but what was it his office what is that that brought around said it's not the the man with a whistle stand out on the thing that blows it he said it's that badge it's his office and says you better stop because that's his office the whole world is backing up that sheriff as he does his duty because it's an office with us voted by the people with god a position appointed of god an office called the for ministry all right are you sure officers of the church apostles prophet teaches pastors and advancements that's what god said in the church the holy experience that's an office okay now it's the holy spirit that's an office so what's so fine the holy spirit might fall on one tonight and speak in tongues and the other give the prophecies and so forth and then next night it might be somebody else and somebody else like that that's local gifts in the body to keep us straight okay but in the church alone five offices apostles means missionary apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists god sets those in the church and let's believe with all of our heart that through these ministering gifts that the great god of heaven will send christ among us tonight amen that we'll see jesus is that not your prayer nine spiritual gifts right that's good but five offices and it was so amazing to me that i've got about six or eight i know that i brought in here and i underlined them to where if you got your notes with me you can find it of offices sit in the church you know what a pastor to a church is he's god to the people no no no no bro he's god to the people as long as his message comes from the prophet but he loses his own office when he goes after his own idea now you see why i holler and scream so much and cry so much about these ministers today and the way they take the message and what they do with it well brother that brother's got a ride he's a human there ain't no rod in the gospel the word is either true or not true but you get the difference see natural gifts you you've got in there but then you come into this five of the nine spiritual gifts and you you run that and there's a lot that goes with that that can be in the body to the brother random even said to help keep the church straight is your nine spiritual gifts somebody speak in tongues and say just need to get this straightened up so and so it's been out here committing adultery there's no problem with that you know what i mean well no that ain't why not you're just in the nine spiritual gifts with the nine spiritual gifts of god now you move on up into the five whole ministry and you see that five-fold ministry answers to no one but has to have as their foundation what the apostles and prophets built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ the chief cornerstone there's a lot of difference in local gifts they have to be judged but the fifo ministry don't have to be judged he's judged himself i'm judged every day by whether or not i stay with the message you don't have to judge me i'll judge my own self yeah but you try to hide it from us so we get okay i got it where was it at i wrote one down where brother random said don't put your pastor too high give him the opportunity to be a human don't put him so high that he can't attain to what you got him it's odd isn't it you mean brother dale i can't have my own idea where are you going to fit it it won't fit in the nine spiritual gifts because one of those is wisdom and another one is knowledge and wisdom and knowledge goes in the statute of a perfect man to prove the individual to be correct so our ideas cannot fit in that well who am i going who am i going to believe i've said it and i don't back off i wouldn't follow the biggest portion of the pastors of this message or the preachers of this message i would not follow them i would not go to church with them i would hunt for me something else if i had to drive across the country well brother you're trying to run me off if i can run you off that's great because i'm getting rid of a problem and you're getting rid of one because you're going somewhere else this church ain't never been built on brother dale as a it's always built on one thing the word of god let me take that prophet like what i said when i started looking at this gibson collins immediately it started appearing office office office office office office i never thought of the fifo ministry being in office had you you ever thought i mean literally had you ever thought about the fivefold ministry as an office god given office responsible to god himself don't go to a 5-4 ministry prophecy i think you're wrong let's print off where he is so i ain't going to talk to you about what i think here's what he said that's no problem to me because i know one thing for sure you're right and i'm wrong or i'm right and you're wrong or both of us are wrong because we both can't be right and put it in the wrong thing do you understand what i'm getting at the gifts that god gave the church is offices to run the church offices that's why don't don't come to me and say brother dale would it be something if you could run for president you are degrading my little bit of mentality that i already have or think i have because i'm in the greatest position i'm in the greatest office because i am in no way trying to be a brother branham to be a that has already been fulfilled and cannot be fulfilled by nobody but that point that he done it and it wouldn't matter if i'd have been there you would have been there you say if i'd have been there i'd have said it if you'd have been there and you'd been like me you'd messed it up so the best thing to say if you'd been there just forget it sit down and listen to the prophet brother dale you're just hateful because i've seen you when you enjoy you know and you'd be happy about what you're seeing i'm happy about what i see but i'm trying my best to save your soul i'm trying to preach what the prophet has said to us to save your soul and then if i miss it i have no problems because i reached that position a long time ago i believe that where brother branham said it he said with the attitude i have something like he said i could look at god and he could say you're lost and going to hell and he said i'd say i love him and walk right on by now notice what he said if he went with the attitude he had right there but the attitude i have in the baptism of the holy ghost and what a pastor of a church is and what i'm trying to do and what i'm trying to get you to do i could walk before god and say thank you i tell him every day thank you lord thank you for showing me these things now help me get it to the people because i'm just trying to be the best i can an office see we look at gifts and things we don't think about it being an office but that's what it is it's an office that a minister stands in an office where nobody else can stand he gives an account to the the lord himself well brother dale you don't think i got a right to come and tell you wrong i'll give you the right to come and tell me i'm wrong i don't care whether it's right or not whether it's right with god or not i'll give it to you myself because i want to be right and i want you to be right a five-fold ministry is an office set aside of god as a gift to give unto the church whatever you do with a gift now i'm quoting brother random whatever you do with a gift is how you dealing with god but now if your pastors are dying to lead you through while you're running around to the neighbors try to find some oh why are you traveling somewhere to try to find something or sit and listen to that on the internet something when you believe your pastor is ordained to lead you through now now let's keep it straight because you know i have never said a word about you doing that i have never said you was wrong to go to other churches but i said one thing for sure that i've always stood on you bring back a doctrine i will come to the pulpit and denounce that doctrine because i am the pastor i am ordained to lead you through well let's get to the point where we need to be well what do you want us to do brother today i'll take a special offering for you today oh that's good how about me giving you something that's where you can't argue with me you can't argue with me about those things you can't argue and say what do you want an offering a special offering right up to buy you a new cadillac i'll give away more than most of you making a year easily christmas alone is 14 to 15 or 16 thousand dollars for to give you at christmas why because i want to not because i have to but i want to i want to help you because to me that's a pastor like i said the man said don't get between a man and his wife okay the best thing you do is get there and say no listen i'm not taking sides with neither one of you we're going to sit here and work this thing out but i'm going to tell you up front i ain't taking sides of you that's a true minister of any ministry because you know how that puppy dog little you look over there and she said well he treats me dirty he don't never tell me he loves me would you ever tell him you love him no it's his job to say it this you want to try saying it you want to try saying i love you honey yeah like i said sometimes i have to say it i know you honey oh but your brother's tail i'm truthful i ain't gonna lie to you about it but you see the difference do you understand what i'm getting at that after all is said i've done of a five-fold ministry what are you trying to do get something of your own some doctrinal [Music] i've had the offer to go to other situations it would have been a lot of money i've had an offer i'd be offering here for it all the time to have a lot of money i've never done it because it don't suit me they just don't fit i'd rather give you than you to give to me then i'll tell you one thing that you owe me you want to know what's the one thing that that you owe me if i'm your pastor you owe me one thing to pray for me you owe me that because you realize what is having to be done and go sometimes you have to do things in a different ways and all like that and sometimes you have to just go off somewhere but listen god's office gifts this is from perseverance number eight but he said god's office gift the office apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and we must respect them if we expect something from god does that strike home you want something from god how do you get it bless god i ain't never like i talked to a man one time he said i ain't playing tired of no preacher well you know what that ended me with ever to be able to give him any money because if he wasn't going to line up he wasn't going to get nothing from me but that's what he said he said ain't paying tithe to no preacher but brother dale you talk about the tithes and things well how do you pay tithe you realize what i do all these ministers here which is contrary to most pastors in this message any word i've ever heard of that they don't pay their their local ministers they just feel it an honor to preach to them every time anybody preaches here they get a paid salary just like i get maybe not as much because it would be hard to do but see i pay tithe i pay tithe upon my working parts you know what i mean by that i retired from general motors i'll get a social security check i get all that i pay tithe on that because that's my income but then when it comes to the church and what they give me i pay tithe on him well how do you keep it straight where you can i don't i just depend on god and some brother comes through and you know we have to handle it through the secretary and they say well what are you doing they know right now that the next fellow that come ain't going to get the same about the other fellow god or he might get more might get less i just say and that's why they asked me what do you say i said 800 000. see i'm paying tithe you know why because that's the money the church give me see what the money that's in this church this building and things belongs to the church but the money this intake doesn't belong to the church it's me and i have a right to take every dime of it and spend every time of it why because it's mine but i've also paid tithe on what's been given and always will i like the way brother dick addison said it he said if i backslide and get to where i ain't even christian he said i'm gonna pay my tithe is because the bible says there's a great honor that goes with that you know but you see i pay tithe see a church pays tithe in the old testament you only had tithes for certain things you didn't have it forever little doing but you had to tithe offering for running the church you had a tithe offering for the but the mind control was the high priest he was in full charge and whatever he said did put it that's where it went you see church i'm just trying my best to be one thing to you a bible pastor now if you're going to narrow it down to five offices i'm going to make a statement that i've made to you many times which is the truth though i don't consider myself to be much of a pastor you might label me as a teacher or something that's up to you but you see a man can't hold two offices brother branham was the only man that could hold two offices yeah i'm not to do it so if you come down to the point say well okay brother dale what are you going to do well i'd have to sit down we'd have to get us a pastor but we'd have to check him out to see whether he's an apostle or a prophet or a teacher before we could vote for him to find out whether he'd be the pastor it's not to work i want brother so-and-so i like his type of preaching well what is it well i know y'all don't like him because he's a teacher but i do now you put yourself up there you're you're trying to determine what office come on musician just remember they're in here so i'll be glad you can have them you've got them of how many times brother branham would call the fivefold ministry offices offices ministerial offices gifts or offices that god gave the church but i can also quote a lot of the other that brother branham said in the church age series if you won't honor your church age messenger he said god will take him off the scene well don't not said that because you say well brother dad we're going to meet right out of church and dishonor you well go ahead just let me know where i can come i'll save you the trouble you know i just walk out because i know for one thing for certain i'm not saved by preaching i'm not kept saved by preaching it's the greatest honor could be because don't run me for president that's not an honor i'm the great at this position or the greatest honor could ever be because there's one thing about it there's only one man higher than my office and he's passed on but he brought us the message but he would say it here today if he was standing here he'd say there's one man higher than my office and he said that's the lord jesus christ the gifts and callings are really without any repentance or any trying to get them or searching for them let's stand together think on these things pray for wade this afternoon and the ministry and the things and we're just trying our best to be what we can be [Music] a gift is also listed and you start studying about a gift and a position in an office and thing and you'll find that it goes to the military stripes on a man's shoulder that even though you hate him i've heard people say you know that we're in the military they say i wanted to kill that guy i said one day i come in battle i wanted to grab him to hug him because i had been trained i said i wanted to kill him but he said i respected that bar that he had on his shoulder if you respect anything disrespect one time pastor and pray for it that god will use him and pray for the other four ministries that's there see we have the greatest opportunity we have ministers more than just a pastor see these are my pastors brotherdale who's your pastor wade bob louise aaron they're my pastor i've got to have a pastor a blessed god i don't know that's nobody brother my pastor oh glory you just exposed yourself you can't hide all i want is one thing when we walk out of this thing i want to stand and look at you as you go by i had a dream one time but i tell the dream is a dream the day of the rapture came and all of you was walking up a ramp to going around and going up to be able to go on out in spaceships and things i was standing direct in traffic i was standing there directing the people the word of god that's my greatest desire [Music] is to be in christ what he wants this by [Music] [Music] anybody [Music] reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you will find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry [Music] he said lay hands on the sickness and we believe it that by your stripes he's already healed and in the name of jesus christ we count it soul [Music] thanking you lord in jesus name anybody else it's just simply to believe him simply to believe him to say thank you thank you father bitty paul told one time that he went to pick up his dad and they was in a a motel or something he said he went to the door he said he stopped at the door said he could hear brother branham he said he was praying said he was saying papa papa we'll see [Music] something meant with that name [Music] see every time a new con a new child comes along in the dale family they generally get to pick what my name is it goes from poppy to this now it's papa you see i know what they mean and who they're talking about because that's the way god is to his people though jesus [Music]
