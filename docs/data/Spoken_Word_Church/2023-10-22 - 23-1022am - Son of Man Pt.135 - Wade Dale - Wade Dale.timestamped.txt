[25:51] in this service you speak the words Lord
[25:53] don't be a a participant on the
[25:56] sidelines Lord you be the active one in
[25:58] this service father just bless each one
[26:00] in Jesus name
[26:02] amen as we always read for 136
[26:08] times in the beginning was the word is
[26:10] brother Brown I was reading a quote here
[26:12] just back there a minute where he said
[26:15] let's break this down he said in the
[26:16] beginning was the
[26:17] logos the logos was with God and the
[26:20] logos was God it's all God there's not
[26:23] three or four people running around up
[26:24] there uhuh no it's a furtherment of God
[26:28] it's God stepping out so that he can
[26:30] reveal he don't need to reveal himself
[26:32] to us I mean to him he needs to reveal
[26:35] himself to us you all right we we're the
[26:37] ones he knows who he is we just got to
[26:40] you know figure out who he is and he's
[26:43] given us everything we need to know it
[26:46] all right because because I believe that
[26:48] God's perfect I know you do too and he
[26:51] didn't write something down and then say
[26:53] well I think we need to do something
[26:55] different no he wrote it the way it was
[26:56] supposed to be
[26:58] it never will change so so if it's hard
[27:01] for you then you need to get the Holy
[27:03] Ghost you need to study you need to do a
[27:04] little more because it's written for our
[27:06] admonition as the Bible says it's
[27:09] written for us so somebody's going to
[27:11] get it he wrote it so we can get it all
[27:12] right so it's pretty plain that in the
[27:14] beginning was somebody was the word the
[27:17] logos the word was with God and the Word
[27:19] was God and that logos became flesh he
[27:22] had to come down here to save us and
[27:25] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[27:26] the glory of the only begotten the
[27:27] father
[27:29] full of grace and truth Jesus wasn't
[27:31] part he was the fullness of God you may
[27:34] be seated in the Lord as his Blessing
[27:36] I'll read a few more of these this
[27:38] morning we kind of background a little
[27:39] bit so we're going to jump through the
[27:40] background a little bit and then we'll
[27:42] head
[27:43] into um talking about adoption because
[27:46] adoption is our
[27:49] predetermined uh destination in the end
[27:52] time without adopted Sons and Daughters
[27:54] of God there will not be a res
[27:59] Resurrection right death's got to be
[28:02] destroyed here yes by a baby no by an
[28:07] adult by a by a bride that has become a
[28:10] wife and knows what her husband wants
[28:13] amen yes get scary sometimes but but I
[28:18] know Mom and Dad's been married 60
[28:19] something 65 years and June and I've
[28:21] been married 44 years and I know some of
[28:23] you may be longer than that but it's
[28:24] real scary when you look at each other
[28:25] and say something and you're like I was
[28:27] thinking the same
[28:30] thing I know it happens all the time
[28:32] well it ought to be with God
[28:34] too it ought to be what your thoughts
[28:36] are he's like I already thought of that
[28:39] that's good thought well that's a that's
[28:41] a wife the wife has made herself ready
[28:44] and that's what we're doing now we're
[28:45] getting ready now it's just not going to
[28:47] be all dumped on us cuz we couldn't take
[28:49] it we could not take it as human beings
[28:52] and you know what God knew that amen he
[28:54] knew that we couldn't dump it on he
[28:56] couldn't dump it on top of us and either
[28:58] make us do it no he can present it and
[29:01] let us make a choice and how much
[29:02] greater that is that we make the choice
[29:05] and he says that's my child that's my
[29:08] that's my wife right and present us to
[29:11] the world and that's what he done I
[29:13] believe through the prophet he was able
[29:15] to present us now because if you talk to
[29:17] people in denominations it's like they
[29:19] push everything you know well we know he
[29:22] died on the cross and we know there was
[29:24] a day of Pentecost but he lives inside
[29:26] of me but but I still smoke and drink
[29:29] and cuss and you know I'm no ain't
[29:31] nobody perfect you ain't perfect and I
[29:32] ain't perfect I've heard that a hundred
[29:34] times I just take him right back to the
[29:37] Bible and I said the Bible says be
[29:38] therefore perfect and he said I would be
[29:41] spot without spot or wrinkle he said I
[29:44] was righteous because of
[29:46] him so but they're waiting till we get
[29:49] it over there yeah yeah just one day and
[29:52] and every denomination believes you got
[29:55] to stand before judgment now I'm talking
[29:57] about the white Throne judgment no way
[30:00] no that's what I said I praise God
[30:02] almost every day that I think about I
[30:04] think God I don't have to stand judgment
[30:06] like these people have to stand judgment
[30:08] and you're the one that told me I didn't
[30:10] have to stand it through a prophet
[30:12] because all other denomination say oh
[30:14] yeah you're going to have seven years
[30:15] tribulation if you miss a Rapture you'll
[30:17] get a second one you know that what is
[30:19] that um Left Behind movie was you know
[30:22] if you don't make it the first time you
[30:24] can get better and make it the next time
[30:25] there ain't none of that we know that
[30:28] all right we get right now and brother
[30:30] Brown said whatever way the tree leans
[30:32] the Bible says that's the way it's going
[30:33] to fall he said death doesn't change
[30:35] your personality he said it just changes
[30:38] your Dwelling Place all right so if you
[30:40] hate people over here how you going to
[30:41] take hate over there come on somebody
[30:44] how you going to take it over there all
[30:46] right if you're vile over here how you
[30:48] going to take vness over there or you
[30:50] may take it over there but it ain't the
[30:52] over there that we're going to amen
[30:54] there's a there's a difference in a
[30:56] fifth and a sixth dimension I I know we
[30:58] know
[30:59] that don't make the fifth one okay we
[31:02] want to be in the sixth Dimension if we
[31:04] pass from this world I've always said
[31:06] you know they all those jihadist over
[31:08] there and Hamas and all that are are the
[31:11] ones that are Islamic you know they they
[31:13] say that if they die in martyrdom that
[31:15] they get 72 virgins I don't know how why
[31:17] they come up with that number but they
[31:19] get 70 something virgins and they get
[31:20] all this you know Euphoria and all this
[31:23] after they die if they die
[31:26] jihadis about that much after they pull
[31:29] that red or M that red button they
[31:31] figure out they got told a
[31:33] lie they got told a lie cuz they ain't
[31:36] going to meet no 72 virgins they might
[31:38] be 72 about 72 million people in that
[31:41] Fifth Dimension waiting on you know the
[31:43] Lord to come back and U and stand before
[31:46] the white Throne judgment but they ain't
[31:48] going to have they going it's not going
[31:49] to be blessed I'll promise you that but
[31:51] you know what that but see that's what
[31:53] they've been taught and listen they give
[31:56] their life for
[31:59] that they stood and give their life they
[32:01] mashed that button knowing that they was
[32:04] going to be in a Oasis with 72 virgins
[32:08] and they were going to I don't know how
[32:10] them 72 virgins got over
[32:13] there I'm just honest if they you know
[32:16] five or 6 hundred of them got killed
[32:17] last couple
[32:18] weeks just saying you see how you say
[32:21] well that sounds stupid but they
[32:23] believed it so much so they mashh the
[32:24] red button would you R mash the red
[32:26] button for religion
[32:29] right thank God we don't have
[32:31] to we just need to mash play and steady
[32:36] that's the only button we need to mash
[32:38] all
[32:39] right John 16 says when he the spirit of
[32:42] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[32:44] truth I was looking and I can't find it
[32:46] maybe if I ever say this I'm kind of
[32:49] what I do is is subliminally I can't
[32:52] find a quote but brother Joe's back
[32:53] there in the back and he's over there
[32:54] and he'll hand it to me at the end of
[32:56] the service so brother Joe I can't find
[32:58] this quote but uh it's a secret thing we
[33:02] have which is not secret anymore but uh
[33:05] if you look you know as well as I do you
[33:07] swear brother Brown said this the same
[33:09] identical way and you put it in and it
[33:11] ain't there it comes up zeros all right
[33:15] it comes up zeros but brother Randon was
[33:17] talking about the the ministry bring
[33:19] taking the big nuggets and bringing them
[33:21] down and breaking them down into small
[33:23] nuggets look up nuggets cuz I I was
[33:26] looking for and you can't find it but I
[33:28] know brother Brown was talking about a
[33:29] group of people that was going to break
[33:30] down what he said and give it to the
[33:32] people so maybe you can find it by the
[33:34] end of the service he may find it just a
[33:35] few minutes but I just couldn't get the
[33:37] word right and um but so he's going to
[33:40] guide you into all truth so what's my
[33:42] point there's going to be a
[33:46] people a fivefold Ministry that preaches
[33:50] the truth not a
[33:52] truth everybody with me it might be okay
[33:56] to preach a truth back in the other
[33:57] Church ages but in this church age like
[34:00] I said before Jesus never said one day
[34:04] never one day in his life on this Earth
[34:06] he never said I didn't do what my father
[34:12] said he said I always do that which the
[34:16] father shows
[34:18] me why can't
[34:23] we we got that same person inside of us
[34:26] amen the same man that said that's
[34:28] inside of you today by the Holy Ghost so
[34:31] why can't we keep it straight why can't
[34:33] we have a ministry that's
[34:35] perfect because a perfect ministry will
[34:37] produce a perfect people an imperfect
[34:39] ministry will produce a imperfect
[34:43] people come
[34:45] on brother R said if one word got him
[34:47] out of the garden being off one word one
[34:51] word right he said one word ain't going
[34:53] to get us back in either one word off so
[34:56] we've got to have this thing down right
[34:57] so I contend that if we'll let the Holy
[34:59] Spirit the truth the spirit of Truth he
[35:02] will guide you into all truth he will
[35:04] guide you into what to do where to go
[35:06] and what to listen to amen all right I
[35:09] just contend that he's perfect coming
[35:12] from a perfect one and that perfect
[35:15] one's inside of you now where's the mix
[35:17] up it's that Spirit realm we were
[35:19] talking about this morning where you get
[35:20] involved and I get
[35:24] involved he say the spirit of way Dale
[35:26] has come
[35:28] he said the spirit of Truth has come and
[35:31] then he the Holy Ghost will guide you
[35:34] into all that truth all right everybody
[35:36] with me CU he's not going to speak of
[35:38] himself in other words he's going to
[35:39] speak through his
[35:41] bride and we're all under the messenger
[35:43] of the age
[35:45] absolutely but Jesus Christ is my savior
[35:49] yes he's my head that I'm watching to
[35:51] come
[35:52] back I hope he's same way with you and
[35:55] you'll have it straight cuz when that
[35:57] Capstone when we ever get to that where
[35:59] it says love we'll see that those Seven
[36:01] Seals was given to bring the headstone
[36:03] which is Christ himself back to the
[36:05] Earth in a perfect message they can say
[36:09] whatever they want to about brother
[36:10] brandom and his personal life and
[36:11] whatever they he made this and made that
[36:13] and the other if brother bam ever made a
[36:15] mistake he told us that was one thing
[36:18] that man could do and I praise God that
[36:20] he couldn't keep a secret cuz he told us
[36:21] one time he said I can't keep a secret
[36:23] well praise God if he'd kept secrets we
[36:25] wouldn't have known what we know
[36:27] but he was sent here to give us a
[36:29] message all right and present it to us
[36:32] and then that Spirit of Truth which is
[36:33] the Holy Ghost is supposed to what now
[36:37] look the Holy Spirit don't coincide with
[36:40] the
[36:41] message the message coincides with the
[36:44] holy spirit because the holy spirit is
[36:47] the truth everybody with me but when
[36:49] they the two come together and they
[36:53] vulcanize when they
[36:55] vulcanize you can't pull it apart and
[36:58] you can't tell the difference that's
[37:01] right listen I can see now Sister C and
[37:04] different ones that sitting in our
[37:05] congregation saw brother brandham
[37:07] literally with their eyes they they sit
[37:09] in the meetings and they watched the
[37:10] meetings if you hung around that man
[37:13] long enough you just about think he was
[37:14] Jesus
[37:15] Christ I said You' just about think he
[37:18] was how the other ones thought you know
[37:19] baptizing in his name I mean that's
[37:21] hogwash and baloney but still a man that
[37:25] would tell you say hey you need to go
[37:26] hunt over there because I saw there's 20
[37:28] elk over there in this side of the
[37:29] mountain and not over on this side then
[37:31] he tell you what you thought yesterday
[37:33] what you was eating and what your wife
[37:34] was doing yesterday well I mean what
[37:38] would you think and it all come through
[37:42] you you'd be going man but he was human
[37:44] he was a human mortal man and as brother
[37:47] Dell's always said we're a balanced
[37:49] church we don't go way over here in
[37:50] fanaticism and we going go over here in
[37:52] Greasy Grace we pull it all back
[37:54] together all right if the prophet of God
[37:56] said said he had a television then I
[37:58] mean not television but a Christmas tree
[38:00] then you can't quote me that he didn't
[38:03] but don't say anything about the ones
[38:04] that don't have one the ones that do
[38:06] that's what Daddy's always said right I
[38:07] mean so if you want to have one you got
[38:10] quotes for it so you got quotes for
[38:12] everything it's what's inside of you is
[38:14] what makes the difference cuz that
[38:16] Spirit of Truth is going to tell you how
[38:18] to deal with that right and he will show
[38:21] you things to come in other words give
[38:23] you
[38:24] Revelation yeah all right he will give
[38:26] you Revelation and brother Brown tells
[38:28] us in the church age book that the bride
[38:30] in other words we thrive on Revelation
[38:32] we need Revelation Revelation actually
[38:35] is what makes you
[38:37] stronger right
[38:39] amen the brother R says you're still
[38:41] what you are until you actually are born
[38:43] again of the spirit of God in other
[38:45] words all this other stuff doesn't
[38:47] change you your Creed joining your
[38:48] church change your ideas or you even
[38:50] your good intentions although as good as
[38:52] that might seem it's still not right
[38:54] there's something got to happen the new
[38:56] birth is an experience something that
[38:59] takes place all
[39:03] right then brother R talks he comes into
[39:05] the church age book now we're I mean the
[39:07] seal book we're going to take that in
[39:09] just a few minutes and I'm going to tell
[39:10] you give you a little story and we we we
[39:12] did it not too long ago we'll bring it
[39:15] back together now look this is on the
[39:16] first
[39:17] seal right here the first Seal's open he
[39:20] sees that there's something mysterious
[39:22] going on he sees that it's not exactly
[39:25] what he thought it was
[39:28] come on he said I'd have made a horrible
[39:29] mistake I told you I'd have made a
[39:30] horrible mistake if I had you know used
[39:32] my old
[39:33] notes he said the angel come in the room
[39:35] and correcting me on this okay all right
[39:38] so as he was corrected though he comes
[39:40] and he says hey we got to you know in
[39:42] his mind he said we've got to we've got
[39:44] to take this up a notch right instead of
[39:47] just going church church church church
[39:48] church church church he said you tell
[39:51] those people I'm talking to them I'm
[39:54] talking to the bride cuz only the Pride
[39:56] will get the revelation of the Seven
[39:58] Seals and a lot of them won't either
[40:01] right if it's not taught to you you'll
[40:03] never get
[40:04] it because truly y'all know we've been
[40:07] taught by Brother Dale for so many years
[40:10] the first seal Revelation the first seal
[40:11] is not that the white hor Rider
[40:14] Antichrist that's in the
[40:20] Bible the opening of those seals is for
[40:23] you amen and full Redemption for you
[40:27] we'll get into that when as we go up
[40:29] when we get to The Headstone cuz that it
[40:31] CU brother R stopped one day and he said
[40:32] he is those
[40:34] seals he is the Seals All right so if
[40:38] he's the seals then the white horse
[40:39] rider was the Antichrist right it was an
[40:42] exposing or a revealing of where Satan
[40:45] was at the time and that now he's got to
[40:48] get out of here so that God can take
[40:50] over my life and your life never since
[40:54] Jesus Christ was on the earth I believe
[40:55] this 100% % he's never had such a
[40:57] formidable opponent than he does right
[40:59] now and that's the wife of Jesus Christ
[41:02] all right and we're going to keep
[41:04] believing that I'm just going to believe
[41:05] it and I'm going to believe it until
[41:07] it's like brother Brown said or somebody
[41:09] said said if Satan pulls all your teeth
[41:11] out we can just gum him to death we'll
[41:12] just keep guming him until till
[41:14] something happens all right so brother
[41:16] Brown tells us there's been churches
[41:17] churches Brides churches Brides brides
[41:19] but there's got to come one you see how
[41:21] that headstone it goes up yeah big wide
[41:24] a lot of people can live by
[41:28] faith but now not a lot of people can
[41:31] live by brotherly
[41:33] kindness hello
[41:36] somebody I'm one of them amen I know
[41:39] where I'm at in this
[41:42] thing but you're going to lose a lot
[41:45] down here as you go up to here that's
[41:48] why it's narrow brother R says it
[41:50] Narrows to a point and that's what it
[41:52] does it Narrows to a point but there's
[41:55] been churches churches bride Church
[41:56] churches Brides brides but there's got
[41:57] to come one Hallelujah there's got to
[41:59] come a real bride not that all of them
[42:01] were false but this one is going to take
[42:03] the real truth the mechanics and the
[42:06] Dynamics and make it
[42:08] fire
[42:09] 100% I just believe
[42:12] that Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is
[42:15] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[42:17] two-edged sword that's why it takes the
[42:19] full word to pierce you you got to know
[42:21] what that is Brother John it can't be a
[42:23] a a a three-bladed knife right right
[42:26] amen can't be a trinitarian
[42:29] knife it's got to be one knife with
[42:32] double edge going in and coming
[42:35] out the dividing of su of Soul and
[42:38] Spirit brother R was the only one that
[42:40] could go down inside of you and just
[42:42] break you apart amen amen listen I
[42:46] didn't have to be sitting in his
[42:49] congregation I didn't get broke apart
[42:51] with listening to the
[42:52] tape cuz he he he delves into things
[42:55] that man has never delved
[42:57] into am and he sits there and tells you
[43:00] he said oh cancer is a Bru cell or
[43:03] backslid cell and he keeps talking and
[43:04] it's like he's inside that person's body
[43:08] well probably he was cuz God revealed to
[43:11] him everything the word of God first
[43:14] though because remember Divine Healing
[43:16] is not a
[43:18] major it's a
[43:20] minor all right the healing of the soul
[43:22] is the
[43:23] major all right healing the soul one
[43:26] time you don't have to worry about it
[43:27] you can be healed today and die tomorrow
[43:29] that's right ask
[43:32] Lazarus but the word of God is
[43:35] what we were supposed to
[43:38] get the restoration of the word he said
[43:41] that was the bait on the
[43:43] hook but we still try to Major on a
[43:46] minor we still try to oh if we had
[43:48] Divine Healing no we get the word
[43:51] first that will come signs follow the
[43:55] believer
[43:56] follow the believer
[43:59] not back here up here all right get the
[44:03] word
[44:04] right get the Soul and Spirit because I
[44:08] mean listen since I've been doing
[44:10] this for 130 something sermons it has it
[44:13] has showed me that the sometimes um um
[44:18] excuse me the way I act I know where it
[44:21] comes
[44:21] from ain't it you
[44:25] Regina you got that furrowed
[44:29] look cuz even in my body like brother
[44:32] Randon would tell us he said he said you
[44:35] know you can go in other words let me in
[44:37] my own English you can go back crazy and
[44:38] still have the Holy
[44:40] Ghost right amen you can go crazy as a
[44:44] bat and still have the baptism of the
[44:46] Holy Ghost in your soul
[44:49] right and then your spirit realm is over
[44:52] here and listen that's where you
[44:54] sin you can't sin in your soul if you're
[44:57] born again that's
[44:59] right how can God sin that's right so
[45:03] separate that that's what he saying
[45:06] separating my soul is redeemed sealed
[45:11] ready to go it's waiting on my spirit to
[45:15] catch up with it cuz remember your soul
[45:18] if it's born again it's
[45:21] Eternal and it's in an eternal condition
[45:24] yes sir yet you're getting older
[45:26] in your body that's the Paradox you know
[45:30] we was talking about the other day I
[45:31] just believe that when you got born
[45:32] again your soul is now 18 years old and
[45:35] never gets any
[45:38] older how could God get any
[45:41] older if that's God inside of you but
[45:43] now the spirit realm and the and the
[45:45] body is kind of like the capsule around
[45:47] the around the soul and it's kind of
[45:49] keeping it you know keeping it pushed
[45:52] pushed in you know that's why I said a
[45:56] year or so ago I said what I tell you
[45:57] let it out whatever you got let it out
[46:02] if it's wrong we can help you if it's
[46:03] right you can help all of us but just
[46:06] let it out but you got to know where
[46:08] you're letting it out
[46:10] from cuz our problem is not in in our
[46:13] listen in our daily walk if you're born
[46:15] again your problem's not in your soul
[46:17] that's right amen one more time your
[46:20] Soul's perfect your Soul's sinless
[46:23] that's why God's looking at cuz you
[46:25] accept him he comes in and burns all
[46:27] that
[46:28] out there's no more hint of sin if
[46:31] there's any sin in there God and a devil
[46:34] can't reside in your soul at the same
[46:36] time one or the other Faith or doubt not
[46:39] faith and doubt when brother Ram gave
[46:42] the analogy of the of the old Indian
[46:45] Indian said oh Indians said which you
[46:47] know he said and say after my conversion
[46:50] you got to remember when he said that
[46:52] after my conversion in inside of me is
[46:54] white dog black dog that wasn't in his
[46:58] soul his soul was a white dog the spirit
[47:01] was a black dog he said which one wins
[47:03] he said the one I feed the
[47:06] most it is the one you feed the most but
[47:09] if you're born again today your Soul's
[47:10] just as Eternal as God is never has sin
[47:13] never will sin never had a bad thought
[47:16] amen he say it's literally in Heavenly
[47:19] places in another dimension but it's
[47:21] still inside of you now your Soul's not
[47:23] out there somewhere your Soul's right
[47:24] here this is the real you this is what's
[47:26] talking to you today all
[47:28] right but we've been pierced by the word
[47:31] of God in the end time to tell us how to
[47:34] deal with these things how to deal with
[47:36] the Statue of perfect man and and you
[47:39] can ask where's my brother-in-law
[47:40] where's Richard Richard's in the back he
[47:43] came from another
[47:45] church when Daddy started preach been 20
[47:47] years ago ever how long they've been
[47:49] married
[47:51] um well ain't no telling well aby's how
[47:54] old
[47:56] 16
[47:58] 17 23 years that's exactly right because
[48:01] Sarah and them were married the same
[48:03] year right yeah I was there both of
[48:08] them but uh we're just a big
[48:12] family but he came from another church
[48:14] and he never heard a word about Statue
[48:16] of perfect man message
[48:18] church right and when brother Dale
[48:21] started preaching and he read a quote
[48:22] where brother Brown said these things
[48:24] are required
[48:26] he said that hit me right in the soul he
[48:27] said and Aaron went there too Aaron's
[48:29] right there that's his brother he'll
[48:31] tell you the same thing when that he
[48:33] said that hit me right in between the
[48:35] eyes just like a shotgun that these
[48:37] things are required they're not just
[48:39] something brother Brian preached to fill
[48:40] up space they're required for you to
[48:43] become a mature Christian all right so
[48:45] that's the pretense that we have of this
[48:47] whole thing that's our predestination
[48:49] that's our destiny is somebody to come
[48:52] to that statue of perfect man our
[48:54] brother I'm just preached in a nice
[48:56] drawing and and you know it's just fill
[48:58] up
[48:59] space I don't either
[49:01] brother but our soul is the real you and
[49:03] if it's born again it's you and God
[49:05] together as persons vulcanized to where
[49:07] it can never be pulled apart now your
[49:09] spirit realm can be pulled apart
[49:12] right memory reasoning conscious
[49:14] affection imagination that's where God
[49:17] works and that's where Satan works
[49:19] that's the Battleground it's not really
[49:21] in that gray matter I know brother R
[49:23] said the greatest battle ever fought was
[49:24] in your mind well what's in your mind
[49:26] memory reasoning you don't reason with
[49:29] your guts you reason with your with your
[49:32] with your uh
[49:34] brain all right conscious is in
[49:37] your imagination's in your all right and
[49:41] you don't love with this thing right
[49:43] here this is just something that pumps
[49:45] we say heart but it's not the heart of
[49:48] you the heart of you is your soul then
[49:51] you have a spirit that's wrapped around
[49:52] it and it actually is the one you feed
[49:55] the most is the one that controls you
[49:56] the
[49:57] most just saying all right so the soul
[50:01] is the real you that's the one that
[50:03] God's going to judge remember the Bible
[50:05] says do not worry about the person that
[50:06] can kill the body he said you worry
[50:08] about the one that can kill the what the
[50:10] soul listen God's only one that can make
[50:12] a soul and he's the only one that can
[50:13] kill a soul Satan cannot kill a soul he
[50:16] can't make one and he can't get rid of
[50:17] it praise God you see who's in control
[50:20] Satan's not in control of this thing
[50:22] God's in control of everything that's
[50:24] going on just like we were talking about
[50:25] Wednesday night he's
[50:27] Sovereign he's got this thing worked out
[50:30] we just got to you know what get out of
[50:32] the
[50:35] way thought them two brothers were
[50:37] talking other day and brother said
[50:39] brother how how long you been been a
[50:40] Christian and and and the old man says
[50:43] well brother I've been in the way about
[50:45] 25 years and that guy said that's your
[50:47] problem you've been in the way about 25
[50:49] years so anyway Ephesians 1:4 says
[50:52] according as he has chosen Us in him
[50:54] before the foundation the world we know
[50:56] that's the Providence of God we know
[50:58] that's the for knowledge of God knowing
[51:00] it was going to happen before it
[51:01] happened
[51:03] right that we should be holy and Without
[51:05] Blame before him in love now listen
[51:07] there was a time we weren't Ho Holy
[51:09] there was a time we were blame blameful
[51:12] not blameless that's right amen having
[51:15] predestinated us what unto the adoption
[51:18] of children so if we're going to have to
[51:20] come to adoption we got to have these
[51:22] things working in our life that's why
[51:23] it's a requirement it's not a
[51:25] requirement to be a Christian it's a
[51:27] requirement to be an adult
[51:30] Christian everybody with me having
[51:33] predestinated us into the adoption of
[51:35] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[51:38] according to the good pleasure of his
[51:40] will and adoption series brother Ram
[51:42] says your adoption is not your birth
[51:44] your adoption is your placing that's
[51:46] what we're going to talk about in just a
[51:47] few minutes right we were
[51:50] predestinated unto adoption all right
[51:54] listen
[51:56] it's like well my sister's not here but
[51:58] she's a school teacher and she went all
[52:00] the way to 12 you know 12 grades and
[52:02] then plus you know she's almost got a
[52:04] doctorate degree and um and she's smart
[52:08] she can teach that gives her the the
[52:11] requirements to teach all right I only
[52:14] went a couple years in college so I
[52:16] don't have that's not I don't have a
[52:17] requirement to teach why would I try to
[52:20] teach somebody something that I didn't
[52:21] know anything
[52:22] about amen what are you saying by the
[52:25] way there has never been an adoption of
[52:28] a Son of God since
[52:31] Jesus you can argue Paul if you want
[52:34] to but the adoption brings that
[52:37] headstone back the adoption brings
[52:39] everything together so we had to have a
[52:42] Prophet come in the end time go out
[52:45] Arizona right get met with a cloud
[52:47] caught up in the cloud and I believe
[52:49] that's when he was adopted because when
[52:50] was Jesus
[52:52] adopted on a mountain with a cloud and a
[52:55] voice amen all right so we know that I
[52:58] can put my confidence not in a
[53:02] cloud but that the person that I am
[53:04] looking toward that I reading his
[53:06] literature that I'm listening to his
[53:08] voice that person had come to
[53:11] adoption he came to the apex of the of
[53:15] the time that he was in so now whatever
[53:17] he had he was a
[53:20] scholar not a book scholar a holy ghost
[53:23] scholar he was a church messenger he was
[53:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ he was all the
[53:27] different
[53:29] things but he was identified in the
[53:32] Bible That's Malachi 4 all right so
[53:35] that's enough for me so he comes to
[53:37] adoption and he tells us he went out
[53:38] there he didn't tell us that he was
[53:39] adopted he told us a story about going
[53:41] out to out west and being caught up in a
[53:44] in a constellation of angels and what
[53:47] did what he say and told to go back to
[53:51] Jeffersonville the seals weren't open at
[53:54] the cloud that's right
[53:56] that's right Jesus didn't preach Matthew
[53:58] 24 in the
[54:00] cloud that's right cuz watch Matthew 24
[54:03] that's the seals he had to come down off
[54:05] that mountain right that's right he had
[54:08] to come down off that mountain and then
[54:10] he came to Jeffersonville and the seals
[54:13] were open there Jesus comes down off the
[54:16] mountain brother rown said it's about 6
[54:18] months before he was uh put on the cross
[54:21] and in Matthew 24 he preaches six seals
[54:25] all right so brother Brown was not the
[54:27] first one to preach seals Jesus preached
[54:29] them right he preached six seals and he
[54:32] was number seven so that's good enough
[54:34] for me but listen brother Brandon was my
[54:37] seventh
[54:37] seal he introduced me to him I've got to
[54:41] decide whether I want to enter in that
[54:43] or not okay so let's look at adoption
[54:46] for a minute so we know then I have
[54:48] confidence that what brother R told us
[54:50] about adoption was not from hearsay or
[54:52] from a book it was from an experience
[54:55] right amen so God told us through the
[54:58] prophet if you're going to get it you're
[54:59] going to get it from that man right
[55:01] there cuz he's restored everything back
[55:04] he's brought everything back to where
[55:06] the faith of the fathers were which was
[55:11] here Peter couldn't preach on them if he
[55:14] didn't know anything about
[55:15] them so the statue of perfect man was
[55:17] preached in Peter's time but it just
[55:19] wasn't all put together so that we can
[55:22] understand it there wasn't a pyramid
[55:25] there wasn't all the church AE
[55:26] Messengers it wasn't the seven uh cities
[55:30] and we sure didn't know anything about
[55:31] having a holy spirit up here we thought
[55:33] it was down here and sure it is but that
[55:35] one up there is a extra anointing of the
[55:39] Holy Ghost we already been through that
[55:40] but we go through it maybe again later
[55:42] on when we start up to The Headstone
[55:45] second Peter 1 says for if these things
[55:47] be in you and abound they make you that
[55:49] you shall neither be Barren or
[55:50] unfruitful in other words you will be
[55:53] mature you'll not be tossed to to and
[55:55] fro you not say I don't know if I need
[55:57] to go to church or I don't know if I I
[55:59] this that I promise you one
[56:02] thing if anything enters your mind that
[56:04] says you don't need to go to church
[56:05] because of
[56:07] XYZ it's the
[56:09] devil no one thing's for sure I don't
[56:12] care if he talks to you with an Angelic
[56:14] voice and it sounds so sweet and it
[56:18] sounds so nice it's the
[56:22] devil why do you think God can't deny
[56:27] word can he deny his word
[56:33] no that's why Holy Ghost people will
[56:35] come to
[56:36] church if you don't you're denied his
[56:38] word that's right for if these things be
[56:41] in you bound they make you I like that
[56:43] word in that big I like to they it makes
[56:46] you these virtues make you into
[56:49] something they make you to where you
[56:51] will not be
[56:53] unfruitful or Barren in the knowledge of
[56:56] our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack
[56:58] these things is blind and cannot see a
[57:01] far off and have forgotten that he was
[57:03] purged from his old sins wherefore the
[57:05] rather Brethren give diligence look at
[57:07] all these what you call these adjectives
[57:09] right amen right
[57:12] diligence um let's go back over
[57:17] here
[57:19] abound all these great adjectives it it
[57:22] it's not just well well
[57:26] praise God I got brotherly kindness I
[57:30] don't hate my neighbor no more but I
[57:32] really don't like the way he see there
[57:35] right no if these things be in you in AB
[57:37] bound let me just put it in my terms
[57:40] there's no room for the
[57:42] devil when God's in there and he's
[57:44] pushing
[57:46] out remember they well you know I'm
[57:50] going to go ahead and tell you cuz God
[57:51] said he hated the Deeds of nickas and so
[57:53] God hates amen yeah he hates the devil
[57:55] the devil hates him the only problem is
[57:59] this one's got an end this one never
[58:01] did I'll go with this one it didn't have
[58:04] no
[58:05] end for so an entrance shall be
[58:07] ministered unto you now what happened in
[58:09] the end time there was an Open
[58:12] Door actually in the age before us if
[58:15] you look in the church age book There
[58:16] Was An Open Door started in the
[58:18] Philadelphia age of what of missionary
[58:20] work all right but you can also say
[58:22] that's an open door for me and you like
[58:24] I when I was preaching brother how's
[58:25] funeral Revelations 4:1 John types who
[58:30] the bride right John is the type of the
[58:32] whole bride Amen in Revelations 4:1
[58:36] there was a door open where in heaven
[58:39] and it says come up hither right come up
[58:44] hither amen and when he got up there he
[58:47] didn't see three he saw one
[58:50] right he heard a voice yes I said come
[58:54] up here did you hear that voice say come
[58:57] up
[58:58] here wherefore I will not be negligent
[59:01] to put you and always in remembrance of
[59:04] these things though you know them and be
[59:06] established in the present day truth
[59:07] like I said before over and over and
[59:12] over as long as we don't as long as we
[59:14] don't change anything over and over is
[59:16] good all right Matthew 17:5 here we go
[59:20] while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[59:22] overshadowed now I'm going to bring this
[59:24] into this to the present day and um and
[59:27] we're going to see the two things fit
[59:29] together here in just a second while he
[59:32] yet Behold a bright Cloud this is
[59:34] Matthew 17 he's up on top of the
[59:35] mountain with who Peter James and John
[59:37] there's a cloud comes down over Jesus
[59:39] and there's a voice that comes out and
[59:41] says Behold a voice out of the cloud
[59:43] which said this is my beloved Son and
[59:45] whom I'm well pleased now that's what he
[59:47] said to out of the heavens when Jesus
[59:51] was
[59:53] baptized when you got born again God
[59:55] said the same
[59:57] thing this is my beloved Son and whom I
[59:59] pleased to dwell listen if he's not
[1:00:01] pleased to dwell he's not wish it washy
[1:00:04] God's not wish it
[1:00:05] washy but when he took you as his own
[1:00:08] when he gave the new birth he was
[1:00:10] pleased of something about you he was
[1:00:13] pleased to dwell inside of you come on
[1:00:15] somebody you got to be able to know that
[1:00:19] when you get to New Birth he's pleased
[1:00:20] to be inside of you now listen there's a
[1:00:23] lot of things he's not pleased with
[1:00:26] afterwards and that's getting into your
[1:00:30] doors in that Spirit realm see that's
[1:00:33] the other part you got to you you the
[1:00:35] devil's gone the unclean spirit's gone
[1:00:37] out walk in dry places Seth rest find us
[1:00:39] none come back but now this time when he
[1:00:41] comes back it's sealed
[1:00:43] yes God can't get out Satan can't get in
[1:00:47] but then Satan says
[1:00:48] hey hey you were a good soldier of mine
[1:00:53] I I see you're still cuz remember Hey
[1:00:55] listen the devil's
[1:00:57] spiritual the devil's
[1:01:01] anointed
[1:01:03] amen so he's so anointed he said I can't
[1:01:05] get back in that soul but I'm sure going
[1:01:07] to stay in your spirit I'm going to make
[1:01:09] sure you remember the things you used to
[1:01:12] do I'm going to make sure that you
[1:01:14] reason with the word of God the wrong
[1:01:16] way I'm going to make sure that I'm
[1:01:18] going to be in your conscience all the
[1:01:21] time you know they always talk about the
[1:01:23] little devil on this side the angel on
[1:01:25] this side they I wish they were on my
[1:01:28] shoulder huh I wish they were out here I
[1:01:32] could knock them off they're in
[1:01:37] here so here's a situation Matthew 17
[1:01:40] Behold a voice out of the cloud said
[1:01:41] this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased
[1:01:43] to dwell now you get to another position
[1:01:47] hear ye him amen now we know that's
[1:01:51] adoption brother R told us many many
[1:01:53] times
[1:01:55] but now watch this is now that was
[1:01:59] Matthew's view all right so now Luke has
[1:02:04] come up and he's writing the
[1:02:06] same he's writing the same part but it's
[1:02:09] going to be a little bit wordy a little
[1:02:10] bit different y'all know Matthew Mark
[1:02:12] Luke and John was written by four
[1:02:13] different people right about the same
[1:02:15] person and basically about the same
[1:02:17] thing but it was four different views it
[1:02:19] wasn't four different views it was four
[1:02:20] views right one saw two Blind Men one
[1:02:23] saw one that don't make the Bible wrong
[1:02:25] and that don't make Matthew right and
[1:02:27] John wrong all right so Luke he's
[1:02:30] looking he writes this by the Holy
[1:02:32] Spirit he says and it came to pass as
[1:02:34] they departed from him Peter said unto
[1:02:35] Jesus Master it is good for us to be
[1:02:38] here and let us make three Tabernacles
[1:02:39] one for thee and one for Moses and one
[1:02:41] for Elias not knowing what he said cuz
[1:02:45] Peter wasn't even a Christian at the
[1:02:47] time Peter was a follower of Christ he
[1:02:49] was a disciple sure but he didn't have
[1:02:51] the Holy Ghost all right while he thus
[1:02:54] spake there came a cloud and
[1:02:56] overshadowed them all right this is the
[1:02:57] same thing Matthew but now watch he's
[1:03:01] given a little bit different angle at it
[1:03:03] he says and they feared as
[1:03:06] they entered the
[1:03:09] cloud now the other one Jesus was
[1:03:12] overshadowed voice came out here pet I
[1:03:16] mean Luke is telling that they feared as
[1:03:18] they entered the
[1:03:20] cloud so was all four of them three and
[1:03:23] one right right and there came a voice
[1:03:26] out of the cloud saying this is my
[1:03:27] beloved Son hear him now watch here's my
[1:03:31] point cuz I want you to see something
[1:03:32] cuz we were talking about it just the
[1:03:33] other day and when the voice was
[1:03:37] passed Jesus was found alone praise God
[1:03:41] Amen when you see Jesus
[1:03:44] only you're doing
[1:03:47] good and they kept it close watch and
[1:03:50] told no man in those days any of those
[1:03:53] things which they had
[1:03:55] seen they told
[1:03:58] nobody why cuz it wasn't for them they
[1:04:01] didn't know them come to
[1:04:05] adoption come on stay awake for a
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] minute some of you already went to land
[1:04:11] of ND kan's one that did
[1:04:17] that but it wasn't for them it was for
[1:04:22] us they entered the class
[1:04:28] everybody with me now let's go to
[1:04:29] questions and answers I was talking
[1:04:31] brother George Smith and everybody knows
[1:04:32] brother George his brother Bram
[1:04:33] son-in-law and U I tried to get some
[1:04:36] firsthand information from him a lot of
[1:04:38] people don't like brother George but I
[1:04:39] do he's matter of fact and I appreciate
[1:04:41] matter of fact people cuz I seem to be
[1:04:43] that way sometimes
[1:04:45] myself praise the Lord anyhow we're all
[1:04:48] different all right God liked me this
[1:04:50] way okay or it made me different he's
[1:04:53] still still working on me so question so
[1:04:57] anyway so now that was the first seal
[1:04:59] just a few minutes ago when brother R
[1:05:01] was telling he said I now I'll call you
[1:05:02] a bride all right so now he's preached a
[1:05:06] whole week this was Monday Tuesday
[1:05:08] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday he
[1:05:11] was preaching he preached to the six
[1:05:14] seal now is everybody with me he said
[1:05:17] the greatest week of all my
[1:05:20] Ministry was this week right here it was
[1:05:23] the opening of the seals that had been
[1:05:25] closed since Jesus was on
[1:05:28] Earth did everybody agree with that okay
[1:05:32] I agree greatest ser and I've seen he's
[1:05:35] seen thousands heal Millions heal
[1:05:37] probably no greater than the perfect
[1:05:40] word being opened and he was able to
[1:05:43] understand it and then he's getting
[1:05:44] ready to give it to a group of
[1:05:46] people all right he's fixing to preach
[1:05:48] the seventh seal on Sunday night he said
[1:05:51] we're going to stop now at first of the
[1:05:53] week he said we're going to have a
[1:05:53] healing heing service on Sunday morning
[1:05:56] cuz remember there's always a a breach
[1:06:00] that's right or a gap between 6 and
[1:06:02] seven read your Bible there's six seals
[1:06:05] there's a gap then there's a Seven
[1:06:07] Seals on Revelations 8 Revelations 10:7
[1:06:12] is in between the
[1:06:13] trumpets 6 to 7 so there's always
[1:06:16] between 6 and 7even is something
[1:06:17] happened there's a gap there all right
[1:06:19] the Brother D was preached this years
[1:06:21] ago so y'all understand most of you do
[1:06:25] but look the reason there's a gap is is
[1:06:27] because he wants everybody to catch up
[1:06:29] because we're humans there was so much
[1:06:31] going on that week and and he was like
[1:06:34] I'm preaching the greatest uh sermons
[1:06:36] I've ever preached the night of The
[1:06:38] Sixth Seal he said okay we're going to
[1:06:40] have questions and answers tomorrow now
[1:06:43] I didn't pull the quote up but most of
[1:06:45] youall know what I'm going to say
[1:06:46] brother R said look ask me about the
[1:06:50] seals right make have these questions
[1:06:54] pertain to what I've been preaching all
[1:06:57] week right that's what he wanted him qu
[1:06:59] he didn't want questions about panty
[1:07:01] hoes and and and one God and water
[1:07:04] baptism he won questions on the seals
[1:07:08] well out of 25 questions he got
[1:07:10] two that had anything to do with the
[1:07:12] seal so he knew right then they weren't
[1:07:15] getting
[1:07:16] it I mean the greatest sermon he
[1:07:18] preached and for six days straight and
[1:07:20] and somebody asked can I wear pajamas to
[1:07:22] bed
[1:07:25] yeah pajama
[1:07:26] pants and you know what brother brandham
[1:07:28] having full of Brotherly kindness he
[1:07:31] answered every one of them
[1:07:32] questions but inside of his soul he was
[1:07:36] like I'm going to read you right
[1:07:39] here cuz brother George Smith he asked
[1:07:41] me the other day he was redoing he not
[1:07:43] redoing the seal book but he's making it
[1:07:45] more friendly for people to interpret in
[1:07:47] other languages all right he's not
[1:07:49] taking anything out he's just kind of he
[1:07:51] said massaging it you know how George is
[1:07:54] he said what's the greatest thing in
[1:07:55] that seal book to you you personally to
[1:07:58] you what's the greatest thing in that
[1:07:59] seal
[1:08:00] book I said when brother Bram said it's
[1:08:03] not for
[1:08:04] them that's the greatest thing in that
[1:08:06] seal
[1:08:07] book cuz if it wasn't for them it's for
[1:08:11] me then I can understand all the
[1:08:14] revelations but I just want to make sure
[1:08:15] that it was for me watch and he kind of
[1:08:19] looked at me you know how George does
[1:08:20] and he said oh I see what you're talking
[1:08:21] about I said yeah that's important cuz
[1:08:23] it's me it wasn't them back there in
[1:08:26] 1963 they weren't getting
[1:08:28] it I'm going to read you right here and
[1:08:31] then also knowing that right among you
[1:08:33] things are happening see I know I know
[1:08:36] look that you don't see
[1:08:38] it amen see I'm just positive you don't
[1:08:41] see it so now if he's preaching six
[1:08:45] Services of the greatest anointing he's
[1:08:49] ever had in his life opening up the
[1:08:53] seals that had had been closed since
[1:08:55] Jesus was
[1:08:58] here he says you don't see
[1:09:01] it so it's got to be for another group
[1:09:03] of
[1:09:05] people CU God don't do anything and cast
[1:09:08] his you know you know Pearls Before
[1:09:11] Swine and you know right and it won't
[1:09:14] return void so it was for
[1:09:16] somebody so brother Mark I can this for
[1:09:18] me it wasn't for them so they weren't
[1:09:21] supposed to get it they weren't supposed
[1:09:22] to study it out we were listen I am
[1:09:26] positive you don't see it listen Peter
[1:09:29] James and John up on the mountain they
[1:09:31] didn't see it they didn't
[1:09:34] understand and you say brother R that's
[1:09:36] a hard thing for you to say I know it is
[1:09:38] but look let me just say this now I
[1:09:41] suppose this is just tape for oursel and
[1:09:42] so forth praise God it was for us but
[1:09:45] let me say this see that you you you
[1:09:47] don't you don't get it see and you're
[1:09:50] not supposed to get
[1:09:52] it
[1:09:54] now he's preaching to
[1:09:57] Christians he's not preaching to
[1:09:59] heathens he's preaching to Christians
[1:10:02] bride not wife bride he's preaching to
[1:10:06] the bride all right different different
[1:10:08] different situation here and you're not
[1:10:11] supposed to get it so don't try to
[1:10:13] interpret anything and they tried and
[1:10:16] messed up made the seventh seal polygamy
[1:10:19] made it two Souls made it this made it
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:24] don't try to put your interpretation to
[1:10:26] it in other words Peter James and John
[1:10:29] don't tell this to nobody CU you're
[1:10:30] going to mess it up amen right that's
[1:10:34] why they didn't say anything to anybody
[1:10:35] CU they didn't understand what who was
[1:10:37] the one that stood up and said hey let's
[1:10:39] make three
[1:10:41] Tabernacles Jesus is like come on Peter
[1:10:46] just shut up for a
[1:10:49] minute you'll only get further away just
[1:10:51] take my advice if you believe me now if
[1:10:53] God has given me favor in your sight and
[1:10:55] you know that them Revelations and
[1:10:57] things I've been here with you everybody
[1:10:58] believe brother R was a prophet I just
[1:11:00] want to make sure I had skipped out into
[1:11:02] another another service over here I've
[1:11:05] been here with you a long time and it's
[1:11:06] always been right now see he's been
[1:11:08] there with the people a long time and
[1:11:10] now to double prove it right it hooks
[1:11:12] right in with the word and we know that
[1:11:13] for a fact so you know it's thus sayith
[1:11:16] the Lord that's exactly it's prove to
[1:11:17] you now take my advice as your brother
[1:11:20] don't put your own interpretation to
[1:11:21] anything amen amen just go on and live a
[1:11:24] good Christian Life be bride cuz you
[1:11:28] can't be wife you're not getting this
[1:11:31] Revelation it's going to come to a group
[1:11:33] of people right about the end time cuz
[1:11:37] you'll only wind yourself away from the
[1:11:39] real
[1:11:41] thing when you do
[1:11:43] it you'll only wind your way again away
[1:11:47] from the thing and all you are conscious
[1:11:49] and know that there's something
[1:11:50] mysterious happening and it's happening
[1:11:53] and I know what it is you know what it
[1:11:54] was they're not getting it it's for
[1:11:57] another group of people that's going to
[1:11:59] have to sit under a five-fold Ministry
[1:12:01] to listen to a five-fold Ministry
[1:12:04] because the Bible tells us the
[1:12:06] perfecting of the saint is not for one
[1:12:09] Prophet Bible
[1:12:12] First Bible
[1:12:14] First Bible says we will be perfected by
[1:12:17] fivefold Ministry all right okay I know
[1:12:20] we believe
[1:12:21] that and I know what it is now look now
[1:12:24] I'm not saying that it's the grace of
[1:12:26] God that lets me know what it is it's
[1:12:29] something that's tremendous and it's
[1:12:31] gone right
[1:12:34] now we still believe brother brownan was
[1:12:36] a prophet amen we all do right he's
[1:12:40] telling the people they ain't getting it
[1:12:43] and whatever the anointing of that time
[1:12:46] was is
[1:12:49] gone it's gone right now and there's not
[1:12:52] a way in the world world for you to see
[1:12:55] it wow but so help me with this Bible in
[1:12:59] my hand I know what it
[1:13:03] is it's come to a group of people in the
[1:13:06] end time to get us ready for a body
[1:13:09] change to get us ready for
[1:13:13] Rapture amen I'll clap
[1:13:17] myself so it wasn't for
[1:13:20] them that cloud lifted off and didn't
[1:13:23] come back to right
[1:13:28] there why are you
[1:13:32] quiet God had to come in a sign he
[1:13:35] showed a sign and he showed it to the
[1:13:38] world and and if some of you don't have
[1:13:40] not read uh watched that service with
[1:13:42] brother what is his name Bob what's his
[1:13:45] name no the the the brother that broke
[1:13:48] it down up at brother Luke Gibson's
[1:13:50] Church he's a physicist or some kind of
[1:13:52] scientist
[1:13:54] brother h brother Bill Bill rth yes he
[1:13:58] broke it down and and they can believe
[1:14:00] whatever they want
[1:14:02] to I don't care am but there is no
[1:14:06] rocket made on the earth even an atomic
[1:14:08] bomb that can make that much vapor and
[1:14:10] make it 20 something miles wide and so
[1:14:11] many miles long no way if it was a
[1:14:14] rocket it might be a little I don't
[1:14:17] serve a message that's a
[1:14:20] little I serve a big God with a big
[1:14:22] message
[1:14:24] they showed the whole world as a sign
[1:14:27] that he has come down just like he did
[1:14:30] 2,000 years
[1:14:32] ago on top of that mountain and brought
[1:14:35] us the opening of the
[1:14:36] seals I just contend that's that and and
[1:14:38] if I didn't I'd sit down if I didn't
[1:14:41] believe that I'd sit down and never
[1:14:42] preach again but I believe it with all
[1:14:44] my heart God sent us a prophet to prove
[1:14:49] that God was
[1:14:51] here in his bride in this
[1:14:55] message and that we're supposed to carry
[1:14:57] it on to the coming of the Lord not just
[1:14:58] sit back and go well brother brandom he
[1:15:00] said just live a good Christian Life
[1:15:03] that's okay that was for them thank you
[1:15:05] that was for them that's not for them
[1:15:07] that's for us right all right Hebrews
[1:15:10] 5:10 says called of God a high priest
[1:15:13] after the order of mzd of whom we have
[1:15:15] many things to say and hard to be
[1:15:17] uttered seeing you're dull of
[1:15:21] hearing this is Paul to the Hebrews for
[1:15:24] when for the time you ought to be
[1:15:26] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:15:28] you again which be the first principles
[1:15:31] of the Oracles of God and are become
[1:15:34] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:15:36] strong meat that was that group that was
[1:15:38] back
[1:15:39] there listen they would have literally
[1:15:42] choked on it if they had got to
[1:15:43] Revelation because it wasn't time God
[1:15:45] brings it all in his time and he brings
[1:15:46] it in dispensations that was not the
[1:15:48] dispensation for that okay amen amen
[1:15:53] this is the dispensation for it but for
[1:15:56] everyone that uses Milt is unskillful
[1:15:58] and the word of righteousness for he's a
[1:16:00] bab but strong meat belongs to them that
[1:16:02] are full age even those who who by
[1:16:04] reason of
[1:16:06] use have their senses exercised to
[1:16:09] discern both good and evil our problem
[1:16:11] is is sometimes that gets a little
[1:16:14] cloudy
[1:16:16] amen we pray for me okay if it don't
[1:16:19] bother you pray for me sometimes that
[1:16:21] gets a little cloudy the good Evil part
[1:16:24] all
[1:16:27] right here we are in adoption let's look
[1:16:30] I Jim was saying this between services
[1:16:33] and I appreciate listen if she would if
[1:16:36] she would have said that to a to a
[1:16:38] minister 30 years ago
[1:16:41] that I ain't going there woman ain't
[1:16:44] supposed to know
[1:16:46] nothing she said you know she said it's
[1:16:49] not an adoption until the baby's
[1:16:51] born right you can still have the
[1:16:53] paperwork and all that stuff but until
[1:16:55] that baby's born and breathes and it's a
[1:16:57] soul it can't be
[1:17:03] adopted natural types of spiritual until
[1:17:06] you're a newborn baby in Christ and you
[1:17:08] have this baptism of holy ghost in your
[1:17:10] soul you can't be
[1:17:12] adopted but now you're able you're in
[1:17:14] the line of adoption because you're born
[1:17:17] again all right so now look you know
[1:17:19] what happened when that boy became a
[1:17:21] certain age that boy was adopted into
[1:17:23] the family now listen you got to take
[1:17:25] the adoption that we're talking about
[1:17:27] here as like this one was of another
[1:17:31] family well we were this one though
[1:17:34] naturally and then they don't want them
[1:17:36] anymore or the parents die or XYZ and
[1:17:39] then you adopt them but now remember
[1:17:41] they become your
[1:17:43] kids that's right even the birth
[1:17:46] certificates
[1:17:47] changed praise
[1:17:50] God praise God I don't have an old birth
[1:17:52] certific from Samuel and Peggy Dale
[1:17:55] that's going to kill me that's going to
[1:17:56] put me in the grave and they're going to
[1:17:57] go oh that was Samuel wayale he's born
[1:17:59] on January 26 1960 and no I was born
[1:18:06] December the 17th till till July the 4th
[1:18:10] or 5th of
[1:18:13] 1998 that's when I got born amen all
[1:18:16] right and and you you said oh you didn't
[1:18:18] get Bor and get at one time no I went
[1:18:21] through justification I went to
[1:18:23] sanctification and I went through the
[1:18:25] process of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:27] all right you can receive it one night
[1:18:30] you can receive it one day you can
[1:18:31] receive it at one moment but some of us
[1:18:33] are
[1:18:34] slow amen but I want to know that I am
[1:18:37] really Justified yes that I am really
[1:18:40] Sanctified that's all
[1:18:42] gone and then God seals me by the
[1:18:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the new
[1:18:46] birth am
[1:18:51] amen oh don't miss this now look that
[1:18:54] boy was adopted into the family in other
[1:18:56] words he was still a family he was a
[1:18:57] family member he was born to that Daddy
[1:19:00] literally all right but what he's going
[1:19:03] to do is he's going to positionally
[1:19:05] place him in the family of authority all
[1:19:08] right in the family comma with authority
[1:19:11] all right so they took him out in a
[1:19:13] public
[1:19:18] place put a special robe on
[1:19:21] him and had a ceremony seven angels
[1:19:25] actually and all the people of the city
[1:19:27] gathered around and look but you know
[1:19:29] let me stop right here real quick we
[1:19:30] keep pointing to this we keep pointing
[1:19:32] to brother Brown being adopted that's
[1:19:34] not going to adopt
[1:19:36] you amen that's right that's it no you
[1:19:41] got to believe the message of the hour
[1:19:42] you got to believe that you don't not
[1:19:43] taking milk anymore that you want strong
[1:19:45] meat you going you're the one that's
[1:19:47] going to have to have a mountain
[1:19:50] experience amen
[1:19:53] yeah they took him out in a public place
[1:19:56] put a special robe on him had a ceremony
[1:19:58] and all the people of the city gathered
[1:20:00] around and looked and when they looked
[1:20:02] upon this boy and the father had a
[1:20:03] ceremony of adoption oh don't miss this
[1:20:06] after that son was adopted his name on
[1:20:09] the checkbook was good as his daddy's
[1:20:11] now the the quote I read you this
[1:20:13] morning was God give you a checkbook
[1:20:16] with his name signed on it just to make
[1:20:18] sure that you don't mess up but now it's
[1:20:21] so much of full Authority he say here
[1:20:22] here's checkbook you write it for
[1:20:24] whatever you need because I have put my
[1:20:26] complete trust in you I have watched you
[1:20:28] down through your Christian Life I have
[1:20:30] watched your experience and it's
[1:20:33] true and you're just like your
[1:20:40] daddy there's where God's trying to get
[1:20:42] his church yes just say to this mountain
[1:20:45] be moved and it will move Authority sons
[1:20:47] of God the whole Creations groaning and
[1:20:50] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:20:52] sons of God am that's why we can't take
[1:20:56] denominational ideas they get cut off
[1:20:58] they can't go higher they can't go in
[1:21:01] Revel you can't have a revelation there
[1:21:02] is no revelation of God being three
[1:21:06] there's no revelation of baptism and a
[1:21:08] title there's no Revelation to that so
[1:21:11] it's just dead
[1:21:14] right waiting for the manifestation of
[1:21:16] the sons of God waiting to a spot look
[1:21:19] where that sickness will be arise and it
[1:21:21] will be there be that way the blind will

[1:23:16] always talk about the guys you women
[1:23:20] too you got to come to adoption
[1:23:23] yeah you got to come to speak in terms
[1:23:25] with
[1:23:26] God
[1:23:29] Amen now
[1:23:31] watch but how can the church the
[1:23:33] Pentecostal church and the Methodist and
[1:23:35] Baptist Churches be adopted until they
[1:23:38] come to
[1:23:39] discipline now here we're going to look
[1:23:41] at something right here we've got to be
[1:23:44] disciplined
[1:23:46] first God could not trust this power
[1:23:50] with the
[1:23:51] church
[1:23:54] it's hard to tell what they' do with it
[1:23:57] in other
[1:23:58] words how could a father trust his
[1:24:00] business with a boy that might simply
[1:24:03] pollute his whole
[1:24:06] inheritance he couldn't do it the church
[1:24:09] has got to come to a place to where it's
[1:24:13] disciplined God's Own that work right
[1:24:17] now
[1:24:19] discipline patience temperance the
[1:24:23] virtues disciplined knowing what God
[1:24:26] wants and not have to go
[1:24:33] huh and I'll tell you how that happens
[1:24:36] about the adoption I was going to back
[1:24:38] I'll back up right here but even in
[1:24:39] Israel because the Bible says that
[1:24:41] adoption pertains to Israel in the Bible
[1:24:43] all right but we take it as Gentiles
[1:24:45] because that's our growth development
[1:24:47] that's our you know going up the statue
[1:24:49] of perfect man or whatever more but over
[1:24:51] in Israel m if that Mom and Dad were
[1:24:53] here they' tell you they went through
[1:24:54] one it's called a bar
[1:24:56] mitzvah have you ever heard of that well
[1:24:58] look it up Google it I'm sure you'll
[1:24:59] find
[1:25:00] something Bar Mitzvah is when they take
[1:25:03] a son they take him out and I'll tell
[1:25:06] you a little background of this in a
[1:25:07] minute they take him out put a special
[1:25:09] robe on actually they have a party they
[1:25:12] have a ceremony they have a party they
[1:25:13] bring the guy the the kid out and said
[1:25:15] hey this person has come to a certain uh
[1:25:19] level of maturity now what happens is in
[1:25:22] Israel you couldn't now the reason we
[1:25:25] look at this is because remember Jesus
[1:25:27] when he was 13 now look he was a baby he
[1:25:30] comes up to about two years old then you
[1:25:32] don't hear nothing from him until he's
[1:25:36] 13 come on that's right at 13 he he pops
[1:25:40] up and he's in a temple right and he's
[1:25:44] reading the
[1:25:46] Scrolls all right in Jewish tradition
[1:25:49] you cannot read a scroll till you're 13
[1:25:51] years old
[1:25:53] so they have a bar mitvah which bar
[1:25:56] means son remember Simon bar Jonas that
[1:25:59] means Simon was the son of Jonas bar
[1:26:02] means son of Mitzvah means
[1:26:06] promise so a son of Promise that's me
[1:26:10] and you we have our own bar mits for all
[1:26:12] the time if we're going up a statue of
[1:26:13] perfect man we've come to a place that
[1:26:16] we can at 13 now in Israel at 13 years
[1:26:20] old they're allowed to go into the
[1:26:21] temple open the Scrolls and read them
[1:26:24] well that's exactly what Jesus did at 13
[1:26:26] years
[1:26:27] old he didn't listen he didn't break the
[1:26:30] law amen he had to come under the law
[1:26:33] that's right the law said you had to be
[1:26:35] a certain age before you could read well
[1:26:37] that's what he did remember they found
[1:26:38] him they come back found him doing what
[1:26:41] reading the
[1:26:43] Scrolls what about that the word reading
[1:26:46] the
[1:26:48] word he said I must be about my what
[1:26:51] father business all right but that's
[1:26:54] what a bar mitzvah is now they put a
[1:26:56] robe on you they put all kind of these
[1:26:58] pretty streamers and all this stuff and
[1:26:59] they have a big party celebration
[1:27:01] because your son has come to adoption or
[1:27:05] bar mitzvah or become the son of the
[1:27:07] promise all right so that's something
[1:27:09] you can that was a life lesson so now
[1:27:11] let's get back to scripture Romans 8 ver
[1:27:14] 21 says because the creature itself also
[1:27:16] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:27:19] corruption and the Glorious Liberty of
[1:27:21] the children of God now look because the
[1:27:22] creat creature creation itself remember
[1:27:26] the creation or the cre or the the
[1:27:29] creation underneath Adam fell because of
[1:27:31] who
[1:27:32] Adam man fell everything else fell
[1:27:35] underneath him so that's why the whole
[1:27:38] world is
[1:27:39] groaning waiting for the adoption to
[1:27:42] with the Redemption of the body we're
[1:27:43] going to read that the whole for we know
[1:27:45] that the whole creation verse 22 granth
[1:27:48] and travaileth in pain together until
[1:27:50] now listen every earthquake
[1:27:53] Quake every typhoon every
[1:27:57] hurricane amen it's caused because this
[1:28:00] world is going through birth pains and
[1:28:02] it's because me and you have not got to
[1:28:04] the right place to run them out of
[1:28:07] existence cuz that whole world is
[1:28:09] groaning and rocking why do you think
[1:28:12] there's going to be a big earthquake
[1:28:13] when we leave this
[1:28:15] place all of creation is saying hey get
[1:28:19] back to where you were get back to where
[1:28:23] there's not dead animals on the side of
[1:28:24] the road get back to where there's not
[1:28:26] all this sin and debauchery going on
[1:28:28] let's get back to
[1:28:30] that amen that's what's groaning well
[1:28:33] you you know why you're the Earth this
[1:28:36] is what supposed to groan
[1:28:39] first
[1:28:41] sorry for we know that the whole
[1:28:44] creation granth and travaileth in pain
[1:28:47] together until now and not only they but
[1:28:51] ourselves also which have the first
[1:28:54] fruits of the spirit me and
[1:28:59] you we are supposed to be groaning
[1:29:01] within
[1:29:03] ourself waiting for the adoption to with
[1:29:07] the Redemption are to witness to Wi to
[1:29:10] witness are to be part of the Redemption
[1:29:12] of our body cuz right now our body is
[1:29:15] not redeemed because mine's
[1:29:18] sweating and hurting in
[1:29:20] places
[1:29:24] you know I was thinking and we we've
[1:29:27] said this before and I'll say it again
[1:29:29] when brother brandham you know to
[1:29:31] prove uh I guess God gave all these
[1:29:34] things to brother brandham to prove
[1:29:35] maybe not to himself where he was at but
[1:29:37] to prove to us where he was all right so
[1:29:40] because remember this is after all this
[1:29:43] that's after the
[1:29:45] seals he goes up on a
[1:29:47] mountain and the Lord
[1:29:49] says there's a storm coming
[1:29:53] and a man says there's a storm
[1:29:55] coming get off the mountain brother
[1:29:58] Brown said I could have survived cuz I'm
[1:29:59] a mountain man he said but them people
[1:30:01] down there he said I knew they wouldn't
[1:30:03] be able to survive it's okay I'm I'm
[1:30:04] just I'm paraphrasing I'm not telling
[1:30:06] you this whole thing people crucify you
[1:30:08] for not saying it word by word but
[1:30:10] anyway here's the whole Gest of the
[1:30:11] thing so here's brother Brown I'm in a
[1:30:13] situation to where God saying hey it's

[1:30:19] you're not going to get down there fast
[1:30:20] enough to get them off the mountain
[1:30:23] he was up here hunting up high all right
[1:30:26] he knew they were down there and they
[1:30:27] were just going to get I mean feets of
[1:30:29] snow sound like Jew forny feets of snow
[1:30:32] feet of snow I love brother juel we all
[1:30:36] love brother
[1:30:37] juel but God is telling him say hey you
[1:30:40] got a situation in your hand son what
[1:30:41] are you going to
[1:30:44] do brother what are you going to
[1:30:49] do so he said says
[1:30:54] okay inspiration strikes him and he says
[1:30:56] okay he said storm go

[1:31:04] it wasn't just what 10
[1:31:07] minutes that rolled out sun came out but

[1:32:10] that deer scared a
[1:32:12] man well that was something going
[1:32:15] on there was an anointing there just for
[1:32:17] a
[1:32:18] moment that if you could have read those
[1:32:20] deers mind
[1:32:23] they'd be looking at that they'd be
[1:32:24] looking at him and say you know said our
[1:32:27] ancestors felt this in the
[1:32:29] garden Adam is that
[1:32:34] you are you back here hallelujah we're
[1:32:37] not scared of
[1:32:41] you that's what adoption is bringing
[1:32:45] this thing back not listen he's not
[1:32:47] going to give you Authority and you're
[1:32:48] going to zap your boss out of existence
[1:32:49] CU you had a bad day
[1:32:52] that's power without character yes sir
[1:32:54] cuz some of y'all would do it I work for
[1:32:57] the post office I got several I'm just
[1:33:00] kidding I work for the government but
[1:33:03] yeah but Power without character well
[1:33:07] see he was looking at Power we're
[1:33:09] looking at Power with character yes he
[1:33:11] said I could have shot those deer yes oh
[1:33:14] yeah he was hunting he had full right to

[1:33:19] so close I could almost touch them with
[1:33:20] the gun barrel well the Gun Barrel only
[1:33:21] about this long the whole gun is so it's
[1:33:23] about from me to Sister Regina you won't
[1:33:25] get that close to a deer I'll promise
[1:33:26] you that unless something's going on for
[1:33:29] just a moment time rolled back and saw a

[1:33:36] earth that they're not scared of that
[1:33:39] the lion is not scared the ox and all
[1:33:41] the different ones can lay down with
[1:33:42] each other what do you think you know
[1:33:44] that's not what going to happen because
[1:33:45] it's in the
[1:33:47] Bible cuz I don't believe anything
[1:33:49] happens just for
[1:33:50] nothing right that's going to be brought
[1:33:53] back by a group of
[1:33:56] people that just for a moment we're
[1:33:59] going to
[1:34:00] see Adam again a small portion of
[1:34:05] Eden hey we better be able to um we got
[1:34:10] about 2,000 years of dead
[1:34:13] Saints it's waiting on me and you to
[1:34:15] come to
[1:34:16] this we got a prophet waiting on us to
[1:34:20] come to this
[1:34:22] because Hebrews 11:40 says what they
[1:34:26] without us cannot be made
[1:34:29] perfect you say no brother that just
[1:34:32] we're going there's going to be a
[1:34:33] resurrection and it's just going God's
[1:34:35] got a a calendar with an an act on it
[1:34:37] and that's today it's going to happen no
[1:34:39] it will not happen until you and I get
[1:34:41] ready amen the voice of the Resurrection
[1:34:44] is already here you're not going to hear
[1:34:45] a toot toot toot from the sky like I
[1:34:48] said before this morning you everybody
[1:34:50] in the world thinks oh when that trumpet
[1:34:52] sounds it's already
[1:34:54] sounded I declare to you today I have
[1:34:57] heard the voice of the Resurrection I've
[1:34:59] just got to get myself into
[1:35:02] that I've got to get myself into the
[1:35:04] right
[1:35:06] tomb amen hallu Galatians
[1:35:10] 3:23 this is kind of how adoption is all
[1:35:13] right is everybody with me but before
[1:35:15] Faith came we were kept under the law
[1:35:17] listen if you're not born again today
[1:35:19] you're under the law dos and don'ts yes
[1:35:23] and it will kill
[1:35:25] you shut up unto the faith which should
[1:35:29] afterwards be revealed wherefore the law
[1:35:32] was our school Master teacher to bring
[1:35:37] us under Christ that we might be
[1:35:39] justified by faith but look but after
[1:35:42] that faith is come we're no longer under
[1:35:45] School listen we're not doing away with
[1:35:47] the Holy Ghost cuz that's your school
[1:35:49] Master but he's not going to have to do
[1:35:51] it Paul said go back and teach you about
[1:35:53] the baptism teach you about one God
[1:35:56] teach you about not cutting your hair
[1:35:57] teach you about
[1:35:58] not right the first principles of the
[1:36:01] Oracles of God we need to move on from
[1:36:03] that if we have a problem with that
[1:36:06] that's okay that means you're a
[1:36:08] baby please realize that position but
[1:36:12] don't stay there move
[1:36:14] forward
[1:36:16] right cuz like I said before you people
[1:36:19] will tell you stuff well that's just the
[1:36:20] Old Testament
[1:36:21] about the pants and all that stuff you
[1:36:23] know women not supposed to wear a
[1:36:24] garment pertaining to man they have yeah
[1:36:26] they tell me I said that's the Old
[1:36:27] Testament I said so is The Ten
[1:36:29] Commandments you going to do away with
[1:36:31] them too oh that was Old Testament y'all
[1:36:33] live in the Old Testament praise
[1:36:35] God you tell me where you can wear them
[1:36:38] and I'll tell you where you can't amen I
[1:36:40] can read in the
[1:36:42] Bible all right so that's just the way I
[1:36:44] see it I'm going to stand before God
[1:36:46] when his word says this right here right
[1:36:49] all right if I stay in this right here
[1:36:51] he can't condemn me or judge me that's
[1:36:53] right already been judged but if I step
[1:36:56] outside of this into the law it's a law
[1:36:59] of dos and don'ts
[1:37:01] yes look for wherefor the law I'm
[1:37:04] reading the Bible I'm not making this up
[1:37:06] okay wherefore the law was our school
[1:37:08] Master to bring us unto Christ that we
[1:37:11] might be justified by faith but look but
[1:37:13] after that faith has come we are no
[1:37:15] longer under a school Master for you are
[1:37:18] all the children of God by faith in
[1:37:19] Christ Jesus praise many of you has ever
[1:37:22] received Bap been baptized in Christ
[1:37:24] have put on Christ that's why we baptize
[1:37:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:27] because it's not a title we're in a
[1:37:29] family
[1:37:30] name I am a father but that's not my
[1:37:33] name sir there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:37:36] Bond or free male or female for you're
[1:37:39] all one in Christ Jesus yes sir and if
[1:37:42] you be Christ in are you Abraham's seed
[1:37:44] and look and what there we go to the air
[1:37:46] part Heir is according to the promise
[1:37:48] Galatians 4:1 this is a continuation I
[1:37:51] know all of you know this but Paul
[1:37:53] writes
[1:37:54] letters he didn't write
[1:37:56] chapters man put those chapters in there
[1:37:59] it's a continuation of writing of Paul
[1:38:01] man's the one that broke him apart and
[1:38:02] put all the verses and all that in so
[1:38:05] let's go to Galatians 4:1 which is a
[1:38:07] continuation of Galatians 3 now I say
[1:38:10] that the heir as long as he's a child
[1:38:12] now look Heir Heir means you're a child
[1:38:16] of God a you're in the family all right
[1:38:20] right The Heir as long as he's a
[1:38:23] child watch now differ nothing from a
[1:38:28] servant start down
[1:38:32] here I've had several businesses and so
[1:38:34] is my brother I'm glad daddy didn't have
[1:38:37] one remember what he said he said if he
[1:38:39] said if I had a business my kids would
[1:38:41] learn how to clean toilets first that's
[1:38:43] right amen praise God he's not he didn't
[1:38:46] have one of
[1:38:48] them that's what he said didn't he he
[1:38:51] said that plainly many times amen we'd
[1:38:53] start cleaning toilets I have cleaned a
[1:38:55] few toilets in my life but but but the
[1:38:59] heir as long as he's a child he dith
[1:39:01] nothing from a servant in other words
[1:39:03] your babies yes but somebody's got to
[1:39:05] come out of that somebody's got to grow
[1:39:06] up get out of the
[1:39:08] diapers look though he be Lord of all
[1:39:11] though down in his soul he's a born
[1:39:13] again
[1:39:15] believer but is under tutors and
[1:39:17] governors and I'm going to tell you the
[1:39:19] um um meaning of those two words look

[1:41:06] orestes of a king metaphorically it's
[1:41:09] the apostles and other Christian
[1:41:10] teachers and Bishops and overseers in
[1:41:13] other words one who's over the
[1:41:15] household all right not just teaching
[1:41:18] you the word of God but all of
[1:41:20] everything your life and everything your
[1:41:22] manner of life and all the different
[1:41:23] things that you do or don't do verse
[1:41:26] three even so we when we were children
[1:41:28] now look we Paul Paul said I was a CH he
[1:41:33] was I was a child too even so we when we
[1:41:35] were children were in bondage under the
[1:41:37] elements of the world but when the
[1:41:40] fullness of the time was come that's us
[1:41:42] that's now right now God sent forth his
[1:41:44] son made of a woman made under the law
[1:41:46] to redeem them that were under the
[1:41:49] law remember he didn't come to destroy
[1:41:52] the law he came to make an honorable and
[1:41:53] able to live the Ten Commandments and
[1:41:55] able to live what the Old Testament
[1:41:56] tells us to redeem them that were under
[1:41:59] the law that we might receive the
[1:42:01] adoption of sons and because ye are Sons
[1:42:05] Born Again Believers God has sent forth
[1:42:08] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:42:10] crying daddy daddy or Abba Father
[1:42:14] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[1:42:16] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:42:20] through Christ
[1:42:22] how be it then now watch how be it then
[1:42:24] when you knew not God there's a time in
[1:42:26] your life that you didn't know God Amen
[1:42:31] you did service unto them which by
[1:42:33] Nature are no Gods amen Bud wazer Bud
[1:42:38] Light porography let me can I just keep
[1:42:41] naming them that's what you were under
[1:42:43] you were Servants of these people these
[1:42:47] demons look which by Nature are no Gods
[1:42:50] but now
[1:42:51] after that you have known God or rather
[1:42:54] are known of God how turn you again to
[1:42:57] the weak and beggarly elements why how
[1:42:59] in the world can you turn around and go
[1:43:00] back to what you were doing if you've
[1:43:03] been enlightened and given all these
[1:43:04] gifts and given all these promises how
[1:43:06] in the world can you go back in the
[1:43:09] world you never got it here if you go
[1:43:11] back in the
[1:43:13] world right how turn you again to the
[1:43:15] weak and beggarly elements where to you
[1:43:17] Des ye desire again to be in bondage
[1:43:20] that's question you want to go back into
[1:43:22] bondage no I want to be
[1:43:26] free the believer's position in Christ
[1:43:28] we'll stop right here just a second
[1:43:30] right here look now in a spiritual sense
[1:43:33] after we were born into Christ we become
[1:43:34] children of God now he's explaining but
[1:43:37] then see God knows best now this boy
[1:43:40] after he got a certain age he had to be
[1:43:42] adopted into that same family he was
[1:43:44] born
[1:43:45] into that's why your Born Again
[1:43:48] experience is not your adoption it puts
[1:43:50] you in line for it right everybody still
[1:43:53] believe we we got a prophet and that's
[1:43:55] what he says right okay just want to
[1:43:57] make
[1:43:58] sure and any Minister
[1:44:00] knows that's the placing of a son he had
[1:44:05] to be adopted into the family that he
[1:44:07] was born into all right could you
[1:44:10] imagine that but that's the Old
[1:44:12] Testament teaching Paul's referring to
[1:44:13] it here in Ephesians the Church of
[1:44:15] Ephesus now when the father look when
[1:44:17] the father became aware that this boy
[1:44:20] was not worthy he never disowned him
[1:44:23] amen praise God he never disowned
[1:44:27] him never kicked him out the prodical
[1:44:30] son was still a
[1:44:32] son he never disowned him he was still
[1:44:36] his boy
[1:44:37] amen but in human terms he wasn't very
[1:44:40] happy with
[1:44:43] him but he couldn't put confidence in
[1:44:46] him that's
[1:44:49] right he was too carried about with all
[1:44:52] kind of winds of
[1:44:54] Doctrine that's what the scripture says
[1:44:56] be not carried about by every wind of
[1:44:58] doctr be stabled always abounding in the
[1:45:01] works of the Lord he's he's actually
[1:45:04] paraphrasing first Peter that we just
[1:45:06] talked about for so much as you know
[1:45:08] your works is not in vain quickly wish
[1:45:10] we had stayed on that a while but notice
[1:45:12] read this right
[1:45:13] here this father then the day came when
[1:45:16] this boy maybe had been all right now
[1:45:18] he's talking about the one that was
[1:45:19] still a son still there still thought a
[1:45:22] lot of him but just couldn't trust him
[1:45:24] with anything all right but this
[1:45:27] boy this boy maybe had been all right
[1:45:30] and was a worthy man you hear that word
[1:45:33] worthy man he wasn't a
[1:45:36] baby he listened to the father he took
[1:45:40] instructions he was a good boy then the
[1:45:44] father taken him out into a public
[1:45:46] Street put a special clothes on
[1:45:49] him yeah right and then the father had a
[1:45:53] ceremony and adopted this his son into
[1:45:56] his family and then this son after he
[1:45:58] came out there was given no longer was
[1:46:01] he just like the servant under a tutor
[1:46:03] he was the
[1:46:05] boss now he was the boss because God
[1:46:08] made him the boss not because he made
[1:46:09] himself the boss everybody with me I
[1:46:12] hope this soaks real deep let's get way
[1:46:15] down deep this son was no more under a
[1:46:18] tutor but he was like his father
[1:46:21] father and his father gave him certain
[1:46:24] things to do the father might have told
[1:46:27] him you take care of this field over
[1:46:30] here see he's placing him in a position
[1:46:33] all right we need to find our what find
[1:46:36] our position or our placing where God
[1:46:39] placed us not where you want to be
[1:46:40] placed where God placed you amen I've
[1:46:43] always said if God wanted me to a pastor
[1:46:46] a church in South Florida I would
[1:46:48] question that if he said go to Alaska I
[1:46:50] go tomorrow so see that's my own desire
[1:46:53] that's not God's that's my desire see
[1:46:55] God don't want that you go where he
[1:46:57] tells you to go I don't have anything
[1:46:59] get South Florida well I do it's
[1:47:03] hot I like Alaska but that's my that's
[1:47:06] my my privilege to like those things God
[1:47:10] put it there for a
[1:47:11] reason the father might have told him
[1:47:13] you take care of this field over here or
[1:47:16] you do this over here you take care of
[1:47:18] the slaves you take care of whatever it
[1:47:19] was he was in full possession amen for
[1:47:23] he was adopted into that family and his
[1:47:26] name on a check was just as good as his
[1:47:30] daddies now what God has done the reason
[1:47:32] we see these things and know that
[1:47:33] there's something wrong friend we see
[1:47:35] the promises of God we see now as how
[1:47:39] adoption is supposed to work it's
[1:47:41] supposed to be full Authority that we're
[1:47:42] able to speak the word and it happened
[1:47:44] just like this we see the promises of
[1:47:47] God we see it in the word of God but
[1:47:49] look God has just began to my humble
[1:47:52] opinion to start adopting his
[1:47:55] son this was in
[1:48:02] uh
[1:48:04] 1955
[1:48:07] wow
[1:48:11] 1955 to my humble opinion to adopting
[1:48:14] his son positionally calling him out to
[1:48:16] one side giving him a certain
[1:48:18] Ministry anointing them for that purpose
[1:48:21] and sending them
[1:48:23] out watch what
[1:48:26] happens when he
[1:48:30] does Ephesians 1 ver4 according as he
[1:48:32] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:48:34] foundation of the world that we should
[1:48:35] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:48:37] love having predestinated us into the
[1:48:39] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:48:41] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:48:43] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:48:45] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:48:47] accepted and the Beloved and whom also
[1:48:50] we have Redemption through his blood the
[1:48:52] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:48:55] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[1:48:56] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:48:58] Prudence having made known unto what us
[1:49:01] the mystery of this
[1:49:03] will according to his good pleasure
[1:49:06] which he has purposed in himself look
[1:49:09] that in the
[1:49:10] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:49:13] yes right now he might gather together
[1:49:17] in one all things in Christ
[1:49:20] both which are in
[1:49:22] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:49:25] him in whom also we have obtained an
[1:49:34] inheritance you know Jesus didn't come
[1:49:36] bring you
[1:49:39] inheritance boy you preach that in
[1:49:40] certain churches you better have the
[1:49:42] quote to back it up but I don't need it
[1:49:43] here we know brother BR said Jesus did
[1:49:45] not come to bring you an inheritance
[1:49:47] right your inheritance was before the
[1:49:49] foundation of the world
[1:49:50] Jesus came to get you back to your
[1:49:52] inheritance praise God thank God for a
[1:49:55] prophet also we have obtained an
[1:49:57] inheritance being predestinated
[1:49:59] according what to the purpose of him who
[1:50:00] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:50:02] his own will which is what his word that
[1:50:05] we should be we should
[1:50:07] be we should be to the praise of his
[1:50:10] glory he's happy for us to be where
[1:50:12] we're at he's happy that we're in him
[1:50:15] he's happy that we're setting in the
[1:50:16] church age that we're setting in he's
[1:50:18] happy that we're come to a position that
[1:50:20] we understand now what God did sending
[1:50:22] us a prophet and then showing us to a
[1:50:24] fivefold Ministry how that all these
[1:50:27] things are going to work out that we
[1:50:29] should be to the praise of his glory he
[1:50:30] first trusted in Christ in whom also you
[1:50:32] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:50:35] Truth can't hear you can't believe
[1:50:38] something you had never
[1:50:39] heard the gospel of your salvation and
[1:50:42] whom also after that ye believed you
[1:50:44] were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[1:50:46] Promise which is the earnest of our
[1:50:49] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:50:52] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:50:55] his
[1:50:56] glory let's stand to our
[1:50:58] feet cuz we get to now I'll back up a
[1:51:01] little bit but Jesus is talking about
[1:51:02] the stone which the builders rejected
[1:51:04] what stone was that Christ the fullness
[1:51:07] of the godhead bodily was rejected and
[1:51:11] has not been brought back until the end
[1:51:13] time and the prophet of God said that
[1:51:15] the bride would be not one person but
[1:51:18] the bride would be the fullness of the
[1:51:20] godhead bodily in the end
[1:51:23] time you believe that
[1:51:26] amen you love the Lord these are great
[1:51:29] promises that he gave us you know what
[1:51:31] you can leave them laying there or you
[1:51:32] can reach and get them one of the two
[1:51:34] amen you can leave them there if you
[1:51:35] want to you can leave this thing laying
[1:51:37] on the shelf and it will absolutely do

[2:02:27] Dale cuz he loved Terry and Terry was
[2:02:30] just a good honest man he wasn't a
[2:02:31] Believer but he was just a good honest
[2:02:33] man we love to hunt with him and
[2:02:38] that he walked out and got his Bell F he
[2:02:41] pulled the prayer cloth

[2:02:45] just now Terry was coming between the
[2:02:47] two buildings he was coming out you know
[2:02:49] he was getting tired he cuz he had
[2:02:51] cancer he was getting tired you know and
[2:02:52] he couldn't hunt cuz we did a lot of
[2:02:54] walking and um and he just kind of moped
[2:02:59] out daddy walked up to him and said said
[2:03:02] Terry said this this cloth we believe
[2:03:05] that we pray over
[2:03:07] it and according to Acts
[2:03:10] 19 we can take these prayer CLA pray
[2:03:13] over them and the sicks
[2:03:16] healed amen we've seen it
[2:03:19] all right so he gave it to Terry Terry
[2:03:21] said thank you Sam I appreciate that
[2:03:22] Daddy

[2:03:28] crazy he said put this in your
[2:03:31] billfold he said I'll see you in
[2:03:38] March we saw him in
[2:03:40] March and the March after that and the
[2:03:43] March after that and the March after
[2:03:45] that and the

[2:04:15] hunting in
[2:04:16] Alaska for a month climbing mountains he
[2:04:20] hunted with us for nine years and
[2:04:22] finally he did pass away but hey 3
[2:04:25] months he was supposed to been gone we

[2:04:41] and we hunted and he just got back
[2:04:43] stronger and he he got back healthy
[2:04:44] again and his color came back and it was
[2:04:47] just a complete Miracle just by prayer
[2:04:48] CL right from a Believer to non to a
[2:04:52] non-believer now he didn't he wasn't an
[2:04:54] atheist but he just wasn't a Believer
[2:04:55] like well I know where that's that I
[2:04:57] know what that is Daddy had to explain
[2:04:59] it to
[2:05:00] him that's
[2:05:02] Authority and power behind that
[2:05:05] Authority praise God that we can come to
[2:05:07] that hand these prayer cloths to people
[2:05:10] amen listen we've seen people heal
[2:05:12] taking
[2:05:16] communion took communion Brother Dean
[2:05:18] that time house and he was just
[2:05:20] completely gone not dead but I mean he
[2:05:22] was just sick dead dog sick he raised up
[2:05:25] took communion started speaking in
[2:05:27] tongues come out of that thing and I
[2:05:29] hope I make communion wine that
[2:05:32] good it wasn't the wine by the way the
[2:05:35] communion wine is doing pretty well so
[2:05:37] brother Joe is doing a video on it now
[2:05:38] so we're going to give it to little
[2:05:40] churches so they can make their own
[2:05:41] communion wine not have to buy that junk
[2:05:43] outside cuz it's got all kind of stuff
[2:05:45] in it but anyway but there's Authority
[2:05:48] cuz all and it wasn't you know it wasn't
[2:05:51] daddy didn't Shake
[2:05:52] him you know didn't throw him on the
[2:05:54] ground and beat on
[2:05:57] him he just said look here's a
[2:06:01] promise the Bible will back it up you
[2:06:04] just believe it and Buddy when he called
[2:06:07] me cuz he didn't have D number he called
[2:06:09] me he said man he said whatever it is he
[2:06:12] said I'll see y'all in March he said
[2:06:16] because they the doctor told me he said
[2:06:17] I don't we don't know said we wrote
[2:06:19] mystery across this
[2:06:21] file well I know that
[2:06:24] mystery I was a part of it and you are a
[2:06:28] part of it every time you people healed
[2:06:30] and people that you're attached to that
[2:06:31] get better and all listen God can heal
[2:06:33] instantly and he can heal over time
[2:06:36] doesn't matter God's still the Healer
[2:06:39] listen he's up there right now in the
[2:06:40] hospital at Northeast Georgia Medical
[2:06:42] Center God is himself the Healer he's
[2:06:45] healing in people and they don't even
[2:06:46] know him that's right cuz remember
[2:06:48] there's no nobody healing them but God
[2:06:50] Satan's not healing them that's for sure
[2:06:53] Satan's wanted to put them in the
[2:06:54] hospital so God's our healer so if you
