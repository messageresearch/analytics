holy holy Lord got on money good to be in the house of the Lord could have each and every one of you here all smiling and feeling good everybody doing alright at least doing a good job leading saying good good to have everybody back I know Bob's life's not back yet and June will be here in a few minutes so we'll have both of them back get everybody back together again I like it when the teams together I don't like it when they're all separated all out in different places so we have a good team and a good support team so it's good to have good to have them here and I can remember years ago when it was a it was a miracle to just have a piano player daddy remember that lead singing preaching deacon clean the charts all in one person but now the Lord blessed us over the years too to be able to put together a good a good team so and that's okay but I'd rather be on God's team then just be this team but but now it can be this team and God's team we can put them together and it will be wonderful some we thank all of you for coming we are going to probably try to step on a little few things that brother Dale couldn't to this morning there's a few few new ones here so and that's alright that's I feel sorry for him sometimes he won't go he's like huh it's like a horse at the Kentucky Derby you know he's getting ready and then somebody comes in he goes thank you but that's okay but really it's not a problem because you know what before the foundation of the world God knew they'd be here and knew that they didn't have to listen to a certain sermon so we you know we don't we don't I wish you had new ones every service hey ma'am I just wish they'd come back and stay anyway and you know you never know you plant a seed come up a little bit later sometimes so let's turn to 2nd Corinthians and back where we were again but we're going to kind of go to another level at them for the time this would be to life's part 3 but we're going to talk about building his family because that's what Christ came to do he came to build his family and release the life so that we can have two life because if you had just one life the first life Rome the first life dying the first life had a beginning the first life is going to have an end so we had to come somebody come down to this life and man give His life so that we could go to eternal life ma'am so we'll get to that in just a few minutes but if you would turn to 2nd Corinthians 5 verse 1 they'll have it up on the screen and then we'll read Galatians 2 verse 20 and then we're kind of background a few minutes and then we'll carry on all right let's bow our heads there Heavenly Father we pray Lord then you'll be with us today as an active participant in the service you do the speaking you do the hearing you'd be the one Lord that gives revelation father we pray that you would just be with the ones that are traveling sister Monica and June ones that are not here it will bring them all back safe home Lord we pray that you just be with the ones that are not here that are sick that you just touched them sister Glenn some of the ones that went home just touch them father and give them strength blessed each one today give us a charge of energy to make it through this time and then a super charge of energy to make it through Monday through Wednesday till we come back Lord because truly that's this world is getting dark the pressure is beginning to push on each one of us but you told us Lord you said the bride would not be pushed out she'd be pushed up so we are thankful that you gave us a prophet that would tell us these things that would point us to you and now as we speak about you Lord you come and reveal yourself probably just bless the missionaries that are coming in be with the ones that are still in the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor the ones that are coming in Lord just give them good traveling mercy it will all be made together a new father let's give us this day our daily bread and jesus name amen second corinthians five verse one for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of this life that we're talking about a man this new life a man because the old life is going to pass away there's no doubt the old life is going to pass away but it's going to pack to the to us that are Christians it should have already passed away man because we should be born in newness of life alright we'll talk about that in a minute Galatians 2 verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ I didn't know this was brother Bob's favorite scripture till Wednesday night I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in this flesh I didn't have to go somewhere else to live this life I'm living this life right here in my flesh the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you may be seated in the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now as we get started we'll look and see that come in building his family there were certain things that God had to do and there were certain things that he didn't have to do because he's God and his brother Dale has been telling us about God and he doesn't change there was there was no way he could come up with a better plan there was no way that that he could somehow get down the road hey sweetheart change made it back so we got one of them back Bobby Oh sweetheart be here about five o'clock so we'll be okay all right so anyway we come to this place to where we see these two lights and we we know I know in my flesh I used to live one life and now I live another life but now remember you can't kill this life because you still have to live we still are alive Paul but Paul says I am crucified with Christ in other words he's putting his identity back to that Genesis 1:26 man that come what here with Christ when Christ came to this earth he brought that Genesis 1:26 man with him amen and we'll look at that in just a second because remember back in the Old Testament and I'm going to explain today it was a brought to my attention that sometimes when we say well there was no one born again in the Old Testament and we just kind of just say a few things and go on well I'm going to go back and we're going to read some scripture and we're going to show that that the Bible tells us that there's no way a person not one person in that Old Testament besides Adam who was imparted eternal life which was not a new birth he wasn't birth he was he was created a grown man and God put that Genesis 1:26 man eternal life into that man okay so he didn't have to grow up as a baby he never came out of a womb but now remember what happened in the fall brought up through the womb so now we had to be all be born babies there's nobody on the earth since jeet sent some Adam got here full-grown man we got here the baby everybody you see guy here the same way I don't care you walk through billions of people they all got here same way alright so but God's going to take that same way and he's going to turn it and make it work for his good he's going to bring he knew we would have two lifes and then he knew that so there's nothing new Under the Sun and there's nothing new that that I know there's things new to us but remember to God nothing's new remember he's already seen this he's it's already happened in his great intelligence and we'll read it in a few minutes we're brother Brent talks about foreknowledge but let's look and see though in the Old Testament and I'm just going to go you don't have to pull these up but remember we've been talking about Abraham meet Melchizedek well who did he meet he met God in human flesh right but it was not the god Savior in human flesh and then it was a it was to be and I'll read it in a few minutes the Bible tells us or this morning I was showing them brother the lease did a good job of talking about looking back you know it's not it's not bad to look back but looking back to the Word of God you should but now looking back on your old first life nature well don't worry you don't have to look by Satan we'll bring it up right he says I said his job is to bring what you did but I told him yes this morning I said I was sitting yesterday or day before yesterday I said God because something came to my mind that I did a long time ago and I said god I just forgive me of that and if we would have been in the dimension of God sitting on the throne God would have looked over and said what are you talking about what are you talking about if that sin that's why the property God couldn't see sin under the blood why it wasn't just under there hiding it wasn't there to begin with and man that's what you and I've got to look at and see that this new life this Genesis 1:26 man is so supernatural till it is just like God it's not finite it's infinite it never sinned today never had a day that it began never had an end and never sinned a man because if it did if there's one mark against that soul of God that come into you then you have to go back and say God you made me do this our God it's your fault that I can't get rid of the sin nobody I'm tell you something there's not his fault it's our fault amen because we leaned back to that oh damn it nature you know you look and see things like that you think we'll well at some times this is easy to forget well there's a lot of things that are really hard to forget but one thing's for sure if you've truly repented it doesn't matter how many times you ask God to forgive you it's done what sins are you talking about I got preaching brother Burleigh's where where God was working on that masterpiece and and I gave a little illustration of Satan leaning over and saying God don't you see them down then them people down there they leaving the message and they shut up Satan I got work to do that's all got to shut up Satan I got work to do he's not worried about the devil he don't even sure he might turn and say something to him but he don't even have to and then what sins are you talking about I thought I thought Christ died on the cross to take away sin not just cover it because that's what I think about brother Brown said well if it's placed under the blood and we as humans think well we you know it's something is something is placed under the blood well then it's still there no when it goes through that bleached blood it's gone you can't find it anymore that's why the Prophet couldn't find it because it wasn't there and that's our problem you know what we do put it back out again we'll read it in a minute the reason the blood of bulls and goats couldn't take away sin is that room as a remembrance and we'll read about it was a remembrance of sin every year when that priest went behind that belt everybody in Israel knew they were sinning they knew what he was going to do but let's let's read it in the Bible this I'm getting ahead of myself but Abraham meets Melchizedek twice Moses meets milk meets God in theophany remember he walks by and then Joshua met him as the captain of the hosts many times God comes through the Old Testament and what he does though he shows his self as a pillar fire or as a the one that was in the fire the one that spoke from heaven the one that spoke from different places but remember one thing's for sure it was always God Almighty it wasn't to take a person it wasn't a third person it was God busying himself with his people even in the Old Testament even though he could not see them he was there and then because remember that's why in the old and back in the Garden of Eden God made that sacrifice and then many times we we've heard this before but I'm going to say it again that before the foundation of the world though they'll read it that we stood as a lamb slain before the foundation where God made sure God made sure that everything brother Larry was covered because he did it before the foundation of the world before that Genesis 1:26 man that Genesis 1:29 26 men come out then the two seven men before any of that he was already slain in the mind of God so you're covered that's our problem we think there's a part in there that God didn't cover he wouldn't be eternally he wouldn't be perfect if that happened man he is infinite he is eternal and there is an eternal qualities the prophet of God said to me and you a man a man there's an eternal property to the II leg what if that Genesis 1:20 six man and then so here we go now Jesus Christ which we should we showed that brother Brown called him King theophany so there was there's no other theophany spilt at Rome there's no other theophany that I'm worried with and that's the eternal it's not funny spellcheck didn't work on my computer so it's not softening it's a king theophany see yeah we've had that up there three times and nobody's seen it so anyway we'll fix that but God in building is family now for me for me to say and I'm going to say something here and I hope you don't misunderstand because brother Dale talked about the book there is one book that has pictures in it and all the other books don't have pictures why would God want to take a picture of a sinner hello if I go to Donny's house don't even do anything for me he'd do anything for my family but I'm not a publisher so when I go in and I look at all his pictures of his family I don't find my picture in there why I'm not a published so God has not got he's only got one book that's got pictures in it because it's his family members hey man if his children will read that in just a few minutes but I look let's read our first quoting and bring him down properly God said in 2 min 1957 and no then no doubt in my mind but that's what Jesus had in his mind and I thought about that this morning look see that word infallibility we've got to realize now listen to me that Genesis wants what them brother Lewis was speaking this morning and I got something else on the Genesis 1:26 men because remember we talked about the infallibility of God right God is infallible we know that well then that Genesis 1:26 man is infallible hello against is 1:26 man comes straight from God it's part of God it is as infallible as God is a man so look there's no doubt in my mind and I was thinking this morning brother Dale and correct me if I'm wrong Paul says we must have the mind of Christ well why can't we take that word out and put soul in we must have the soul of Christ oh you don't know you have if you're born again you got the soul of Christ now we know there's a mind that we think with but remember the mind of Christ when he came on earth he didn't have a carnal mind that's our problem the Bible says the carnal mind is enmity to God not the mind of Christ am I going too far here it's like the we said he said when we say I and my father are one or I come from God and I go back to God there's people in the message that have questioned him because saying that please people we haven't said it enough we haven't got ourselves to believe that's where we came from My heavens where'd you come from and were you going back to where were you last time day afternoon well we'll look at in just a second okay in fact flipped your switch then it just lifts you switch but that's what Jesus had in his mind when he was here on earth was that infallibility of God's eternal Word for we know that in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily the entire Godhead was in him he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost but weld in the human form that the Alpha knee of God the great image of God that he made man in them placed him in the earth he had a body and then so Jesus Christ came with the ability to produce that Genesis 1:26 man Adam was given potential ability to do it and he really messed it up amen he went to the carnal mind and then what did God tell him in the garden see to me that's the great promise and we'll talk about in just a minute the great promise glogg said in genesis 3:15 to me that's one of the most powerful scriptures in the Bible because it says I'll put enmity between you and her seeds but anyway in other words I'm coming and whatever gap that there is I'm going to fill it in and then the promise the prophet of God said the promise of the woman sees what Jesus Christ was the woman sees he's the only one that could produce what we needed no other man could that's why in the Old Testament you couldn't find the person they had the new birth you can find it the person had the Holy Ghost in their soul amen but dwelt in the human forms as he often in God the great image of God that he made man in then placed him in the earth he had a body God isn't without a body God's got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it others saw it and it looked like a man all right we already read that several times now look let's go to John now what happened is we're going to look at this what we call the promise we're going to read in a few minutes you say what is the promise listen if we didn't get a promise of a new life if we didn't get a promise of a new life our old life was going to take us to hell and then we needed a promise and what happened in Hebrews 11 we'll see that they received a good report to faith but did not receive the promise and then they had to go into Abraham's bosom they couldn't go into the presence of God why because their sin went with them sorry but that's the truth if we dies Christians our sin doesn't go before us in that soul of man you're going to understand something one day when you got born again brother man said that was the most important thing that took every sin in your life away from you in your soul what was this thing okay now look remember he promised us a new life he in promised us a perfect life down here that perfect life is coming but you had to get the promise of a new life down here to get rid of the old life that you had a man that's why David under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he could say they pierced my hands and my feet and they he could write the whole song speaking of Jesus Christ but then that anointing would leave in me and he would go and have his best friend kill so he could have her relations with now see a Holy Ghost fell persons that will never happen I said the Holy Ghost fell person would never do something like that Moses was a murderer Abraham led twice give his life away twice did God impute that not when he looked through the blood he didn't he looked back through Calvary and Peter and Paul wrote having great faith not staggered not at the promise of God sometimes that's hard for us to see you think man that dude staggered his whole life but not in God's eyes he didn't now what did Jesus promise because remember our first life that we were born in was born in sin all right so he gave us a promise and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive so remember the whole world is not going to see this new life the whole the whole world is not going to receive this promise amen all right because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you all right now there's your promise I will not leave you comfortless or here's a promise I will come to you not to your group not to your doctrine or your religion or your denomination I'm going to come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me know or but you see me now how we seem we understand him we were by revelation we understand see we contractures like brother Dale said we can we know what he looks like but we can track his whole movement we can we can track him from the foundation before the foundation of the world all the way to the future home because God sent us a prophet that could raise up go into the mind of God the mind of God how'd he get in the mind of God he had the mind of God that's how they could connect and then that's how he can get up in the mind of God because he already had the mind of God and then yet a little while in the world said me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and that day and what proper God say that was this day and that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I and you now if cliff if the prophet of God told us that the scriptures there speaks of the bridegroom also speaks of the bride Amen in me I and you where ever he that that's where we are wherever we are that's where he's at and you know what he's pleased to be there alright in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost now see John brings it right down and shows and God this is you know Christ speaking he's not leaving anything out telling you what the comforter is the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name that's why we're going to see that name come over and book of Acts well send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance now look not the minded mom and daddy gave you not them not the carnal mind he's bringing you what you thought he's bringing you a new life bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you the promise of eternal life now let's back up on Hebrews 9 and let's read going on here because God can't go past his word God has to go through his word alright so now let's go to them Hebrews 9 6 all right now here's Paul speaking now when these things were thus ordained the priest 1 always into the first tyrannize oh now we're selling the Old Testament and I told burly's kids birdies kids I told his people we were talking about the where there was the first book of the New Testament what you think that's technical but it's not it really helps me because I'm going to read to you why that the New Testament started on the book of Acts not in the book of Mathew and then the Bible tells you why all right the priest went always into the first time when I go accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priests remember that was only two veils you had you outer Court veil enter court veil Holy of Holies so he's talking about here the high priest could only be the one that goes in to the Holy of Holies right right which is a type of what your soul a man your soul but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood he took the blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest there's the key in your answer right there the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first hibernal was yet standing which was the whole Testament and then sure they'd knock it down the building back they knocking down that built it back but they always out of Harvard I know a man which was a figure or an example which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience what the conscious carmine which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation so it was going toward something right but Christ being come as a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle his body not made with hands that is to say not of this building here neither by the blood of bulls and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us now that to me explains it right there the death we'll see in a minute you had to have a death of someone that had a soul someone that had eternal life in their soul if you if his job was to bring us back then he had to have a soul to connect with our soul amen bulls and goats couldn't do it to me it's so simple but you you say this in a congregation and they go quiet you know why they don't understand but we do thank God and we're understanding more we're not just we're not just understood and we're done now look neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood why because the life send the blood and then the life was in the blood that could what speak and do some good in the animal it was just there God just said I'll in other words I'm going to allow this to happen until I come but when I get here I'm going to bring you a life that you're not going to be able to get from mommy and daddy and you're not going to be able to get coverage from the high priest and then the high priest can give them eternal life why every year same thing every year next year same thing next year same thing alright for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean now look watch this it did do some good in the Old Testament right there's your right there's your answer it covered their sin its sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh not the soul now how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God he asked the question and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament what the Old Testament amen look they which are called might receive the promise of inter eternal inheritance in other words the New Testament for where a testament is there must also am necessity be the death of the testator something had to die for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth in other words Matthew Mark Luke and John the testator was alive a man sure right over two very ending in the chapter he died but what was the next thing come up the book like Jesus said go what go to Jerusalem you'll be endued with power from on high why because the testator had died and listen to what he says right here because we read it we read it all the time for the let's go to Matthew 26 and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it this is my blood of the New Testament and then which he shed for many for the remission of sins he was going to Calvary to die for our sins amen not to just hide them but to do away with us cuz I thought it said eternal Redemption amen done all rights amen because remember even though we'll not sure we have things now we're real modern we have living wills and all that stuff but a will can't be read until a person dies there has to be a death amen you don't go read a will I don't think I've ever seen anybody read the will was the person sitting in the room that wrote it he's usually gone on to another route to another in another dimension right why because he left a will and what Testament right amen so God left us a will and testament the will being this hello the will being this now watch he died in flesh that all rights a man but now watch this quote I love and this is when I read when I'm talking about this and buddy you talking about people being quiet I reckon they don't study enough to read this we read it a hundred times I'm gonna read it again doctrine series 1960 the other man said inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance number one you got to have the inheritance first I can't give you ten million dollars if I've got ten dollars hello but if somebody's got eternal life okay why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left being inherited Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name what brother Dale told me last Sunday but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world signed sealed and delivered that's not in the quote if you know if you're not reading them if you're listening that's not in the quote okay that's me that's that's a way close that's a interpolation okay I interpolated do what now sure sure it's exactly what it was but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first and then Jesus only come a lot here's the way they try to make it God said well there's a lot of people own I don't want them I don't want be saved so I've sent Jesus down and perhaps may know that a lot of people think this that God just sent Jesus down here and and if somebody would accept him that's good if they don't know my heaven I'll send Jesus down there perhaps maybe he'll somebody will feel sorry I know what I've done and get saved Oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do run it sometime I wouldn't do it like that how about God Road up God by his foreknowledge seeing exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved he sent Jesus in other words to get his children he sent Jesus to save those he had all ready chosen and then didn't Paul say five verses behind this that he chose us in him before there was even a world that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price Adam couldn't pay the price he wasn't a redeemer he did not have those attributes sure he was given the ability he was given the ability to bring us in to me but he lost it and when he went out he tried to come back and he couldn't come back because you know Savior amen they don't know one Savior in this world that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen the what his shedding of his blood that no sin would what let's all read that together that no sin that's pitiful say it with me that no sin would be accounted to us no sin that's our problem though that we pull back into the carnal mind into that first life and we start thinking about all things that we did and God's over here in this new life in already paid you didn't do it in the first place we'll see this one of these days but if he that sends willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there is no more sacrifice now and there's where you will rise up again and say how about that brother branham but just remember who have received the knowledge of the truth they never receive the truth they just received the knowledge of it I'm am that's why that's up here it didn't go down to here it was your mind not the mind of God because the mind the guards down here this is your brain this is what works with you right I don't know about you but this is where I think about some things I used to do and then but we got to realize though that that Genesis 1:26 man never did any of that never did one speck of sin and you got to be connected to that it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and made protectors of the Holy Ghost tasted the power of the good work like the borderline believers that watch that's what's happened today they got an anointing of the Holy Ghost all this the Geoff Jenkins and I'm going to call his name I don't care Geoff Jenkins and all them people like that sorry they never came they just got acknowledged the truth they said the message for 40 years and then as soon as something one thing happens they just deny and go off and say well it's no good no you can't deny God's Word and have God in your soul you cannot now you cannot I didn't say you couldn't understand understand it you cannot understand and still have gone in your soul because to me that's your growth development mm that's God using what using the word of God to build you up but if what God does got to go push your filters out why brother Brown said the greatest battle ever faults in your heart no it said it's in your mind in your mind because if you're born again there's a battle why because to life to life amen all right everybody okay with that but beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance he says I am the way the truth and the life what the way back to this new life under this new testament because the old testament could only cover what you did but this new testament watch what paul right he writes even about abraham he looks back and he sees surely to goodness surely the goodness paul could read and he read come that's all he had he had the scroll he read where abraham live where abraham laughed Sarah just giggled in her heart and God said you the Bible says Abraham got down in front of God and laugh on the ground laughs when he told him he's gonna have a baby but when he looked back through the blood Paul looks back and goes strong and faith never wavered in other words just like me and you that first life there's no way there's no way you can still have that old life though and have the new life amen the life that I now live Paul said I live by what the faith of that mandate how long the cross that what he said that promise we hadn't got to that yet hang on a minute I'm a gift I may skip down guys let's skip to save a little time let's go to number three instead of two let's keep because I'm still not going to getting all the quotes but anyway that's okay but ill knows exactly what we're talking about but to listen revelations three fourteen to me shows it's just the beginning of the creation of God a man in other words the beginning of the New Testament there was no children of God I'm talking about born again even Nicodemus Nicodemus says must start going you know Nicodemus was in the first life he said must I go back into my mother's womb and come back out again the first life Christ said you know that's what's killing you that part is killing you you got to have a new life and be born from above not from your mother's womb again in other words he sent Nicodemus what's your problem well you know he knew what his problem was he didn't have eternal life in his soul in other words he had all the head knowledge of the Old Testament yet he could not bring it down through a filter that could say like Haiti right said that ain't nothing but the truth hey man all right so look in number three now we're going to read this and then we'll go to acts 2 because remember we're still on the promise questions and answers' 1957 yes notice my Jehovah Witness friends I'd like to ask you about that see that hell is a place because remember remember Christ died the testator had to die for us to be under this New Testament and for that life and he came here with to go back into the believer is that all right here his body was in the grave go down to the red and it shoul was inhale now we read we read this but what within help reaching alive what about that he was Dennis theophany again why he had to come out of that body that body was what laying as a sacrifice but remember the Bible said in Isaiah which was one who has believed our report Isaiah 51 53 who has believed our report he says he gave his soul a ransom he gave his soul his body is laying up there in the grave as they what as a sacrifice that was the Lamb of God the Lambs got skin hello a lamb has skin so the Lamb of God was laying up there in other words remember look Jesus's soul never was bruised Jesus's soul never was you know beat it was that body that was beat that body is our sacrifice for our healing amen but when he separated that eternal soul went to hell as a ransom so that we don't have to go any more I've already told you that listen that's a promise to me that if I received that same life that theophany right there if I receive that theophany in me I don't have to do to hell I've already been and guess what I came out and they some keys come with it here his body was in the grave and his soul was at hell preaching alive what about that he was in a theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in the oppan he's also and was witnessing to them that they repented not in the long-suffering now remember when he go to hell for he went to hell - what show those people what all those Old Testament Saints I'm Old Testament prophets and before the flood he said I'm the one that Noah preached about I'm standing here in human and it's not human flesh but I'm standing here in my theophany I'm standing here telling you that you should have listened to Noah I came down in Noah and spoke to you and you in in other words you didn't reject Noah you rejected me I have eternal life but since you rejected me I'm taking that eternal life back with me while he'll can't be eternal you can't put an eternal person in hell you can't put an eternal theophany in hell and then Jesus left that place memory came back up went to Paradise picked all them people up amen he had a job to do but he was fulfilling the promise of Isaiah that said he'll give his soul a ransom so that he could one see his seed well I'm not the seed of Charles and Ella Branham I'm a seed of my mom and daddy if you're born again you're not the seed of your mom and daddy you're the seed of Almighty God amen and that's what he went to hell for is that he gave his soul a ransom so he could see his seed or see his progeny are see his genetics come forth and be something as real listen to me as real as he is you see we're not as real as God is I'm not looking at the real part I'm looking at a shadow I'm looking at a negative I'm looking at the first life I'll read something to you in a minute but acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent we haven't read the scripture ever before repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise there's the promise for the promise is unto you what is the promised eternal life in your soul eternal life back the way it should have been had there not been a fall than alright for the promises them to you and to your children to all that are afar off even as me and the Lord our God shall call now let's go to Hebrews 11 verse 37 all the great warriors our faith all in Hebrews 11 they were stolen they were sawn asunder here Paul is bringing it all together we know all the names Moses Noah we know all the names they were stoned they were sawn asunder that was Isaiah remember tempted slain to us with a sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented and I like when this is a good interpolation of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise that to me is this plain is what I'm tell you two plus two for God having provided some better thing some new Testament for us that all right that they without us should not be made perfect and then you're born again today you're perfect if you're not then you need to get morning in Hebrews 10 verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing look the law was a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing Jesus Christ was the image that they were looking for all those Old Testament prophets were looking for the Messiah because they knew that Messiah would be gone he would come down in human flesh and in other words he would save Israel not all right because that was your customer can never can never with those sacrifices Isis which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have seems to be offered because that the worshipper once purged the worshipper once purged should have had no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year those people knew the date they knew when that high priest was going to get ready they knew when they did that sect one sacrifice to get the one bullet to get the blood to go in the Holy of Holies they knew that and you know why that they knew that number one it was proclaimed everywhere but number two it was their sins they were dependent on him to go in there to take care of a man but it was every year that's our problem we bring up like I did we bring up our sins every few minutes and God said I don't want to send you talking about but in those sacrifices there they resemble remembrance again made of sin every year for it it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin and then wherefore when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offerings out what is not but a body has now prepared for me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure that was a that was a permissive will of God that that would even happen and then in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said i lo i coming the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will of god above when he has said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offering raise it up for sin thou wouldest not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law now watch then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second what he takes away doesn't do away with the Old Testament listen we're not doing away with the Old Testament we have to have it because I'm an put it in here may not but remember it somewhere in Corinthians I think Paul said those are all done for example whose the ends of the world come - which is us all right he takes it away the first that he may establish the second by the which will by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest and of daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sit down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool look far by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified we're of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that it said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their heart heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins now this is written this is the Old Testament scripture this is quoting from the Old Testament if I had my well I got my Scofield but we'll look it up later but this is an Old Testament scripture and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more right the problem with the Old Testament they just kept it just like a rollercoaster I just kept sins were just pushed back people could still remember them but not anymore or by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified all right done all right say ma'am a man now look when at the apne was made flashing Jesus Christ he was the only person that everything could be involved with he was the only one it could be the fullness of the Godhead bodily there's no one else can do that he was the only one now we can be apart and being apart is great but he was the whole we're not saviors he's savior a man but yet through us through life he can save people I say we could I said but through us through us wide in the Ethiopian eunuch need of Philip he was stuck in the Old Testament he was reading the scrolls and he said I need somebody to explain this to me so God sends what a piece of itself that had the mind of Christ he sent a piece of himself down to to the Ethiopian unit you know what he didn't have to set in the message church for 10 years Philip sat there and explained it to him and the Ethiopian eunuch didn't look and go well my my pastor don't believe the hell where'd you get that quote no you know what he said he said words of water where's water if this is what you're talking about it and I'm sure Philip didn't just sit there and go well now that man he I think he died and I think he came back and I think no I believe Philip was very positive Philip said this man who you see in this Old Testament he has been here in flesh and he did exactly what he said he's going to do and this man named Peter if you want to go talk to him he may preach the good sermon just a few weeks ago and he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive this gift if this man talking about and I'm sure the eunuch said where's the water what hinders you in other words in other words well I think he was walking toward the water and Phil it was probably still standing up on the shore bill it was my whole wait a minute what's going on here I'm getting I'm getting persecuted by the religious world and here's an Ethiopian eunuch you don't know what that is a man that is sterile because of what he does things in the palace all right so here's this guy and he looks just so common and filling the plate man you you got to have it we got it in the ethiop unison what if you've done enough talking I know what I got to do yeah wish that's the way we would do instead of what what do we do we go when I wait I don't know my preacher didn't preset that way no the Ethiopian eunuch God showed him something but he showed him something through Philip a man he showed him Philips a zeal to the he showed the zeal through the truth Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch and the Ethiopian unit was pricked in his heart just like the people under their Pentecost was pricked in their heart like the 3000 he was one man and he got pricked in his heart and he says what must we do well I reckon Philip had already told him about the water fill and the beauty of unasyn of words water what hinders us got off that chariot and hit the water but he did it through somebody and that's exactly the way he's working now through his children he's working through the ones that he gave why in the world would God give us a promise and then renege on it why would he give us a promise and not fulfill it amen he's going to fulfill it that great theophany of God which to me is the Holy Ghost amen that's the Holy Ghost in your soul because if you don't have the theophany of God in you what are you you're not born again you're born from down here you've got to be born from wait a minute those that don't know I'm getting I'm trying to quit pointing upward yeah that's true at a slant so let's do this at a slant but remember if you have the Holy Ghost in your soul he's right here he's not over there somewhere he didn't say I'll be with you in beside you he said I'll be with you even in you and man till the end of time or whatever time you know that we have left all right let's read this next quote that all right number four then will then will I stop again but that's all right we got next Sunday if the Lord don't if the Lord comes you know what we'll know it anyway number 457 life let's close our eyes to our imaginations for a few minutes and go way back that's what we've been doing we've been going way back Bell availing myself and old brother brothers tell you I want to give a I want to give a rose Bob Louise is there okay even people like brother Ryan a man let me give a rose they have come it took me a long time to get to know what they know in just a very short period of time and I am happy to be a part of their life I know brother Dale is I'm speaking for all of us but I am so happy to be a part that we can sit and talk about and that God is just what brother what brother branham say he said it's gonna start what pop pop like popcorn it'll start popping what's happening now that short work is bringing them up quicker than why it took me and brother Dale and different ones I mean we've our whole lifetime and here they've been 10 years 12 years only preaching what a year Bob year year-and-a-half you're just a baby in the preaching realm but man can he put things together bring it to us I mean I've got some good things Wednesday night bro Luiz today I got I got some good hey man you clap for him come on you get a one that stock that's not man man can't do that Satan's you're not gonna do it he's gonna be back there going who you think you are yes there's no seniority in this thing no no no there is no seniority brother Brown said get them under the waterspout get them wet and let's see what happens hey man so we get them under the waterspout the great fountain of all eternity was that spirit of love joy that spirit of honesty that spirit of trueness in his perfection and now the existence of the father went to low Gotham don't get into something here which was the Sun which was the theophany that's weed uncovered this couple weeks ago which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word we've been through this you should have that down pretty pretty well then that the oppinion was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Ghost all in that and that's the very way we go plumb back to the original beginning of God hope God don't have a beginning brother it's mine and your understanding not his he never had a beginning but there was a time when we began to understand God listen even when you get the new birth you don't understand God all the way you should why because you got that other life you got that you got that carnal mind beating on that what beating on that person look go plumb back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not a flesh born again not of blood he's gone about the first birth but born again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honor he comes down to make its place in us so don't think that we have something waiting for us sure there's a fullness that is waiting for us okay that's all right but if you don't have a part here to connect to there you're not going there right and when we die from this life we go into the body which if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany to go into a body celestial now listen there's not a body hanging up here like this waiting on us today or waiting on this to get changed no I thought he just said he was going to be in you okay so let's not confuse this then it's a coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked from the earth again this body and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever then all the perversion all the things that's in the perversion all goes out of existence all right now look he talked about evil people here hell opens up her mouth and swallows and all the evil and the perversion and God in his beloved church his bride takes their stand for the eternity to roll on that's the great hope of the Christian Church a man so that the often is what comes back to get you that's what came back on the damned Pentecost it's not waiting somewhere am i I don't want something to wait on me I want to hear to take me there to take me into another dimension I can't go into another dimension six dimension without the new birth sure you're going to go into a dimension but that first life is going to take you into what the fifth dimension you don't get born again if you just have that first life and you just live your life and you still got that old carnal mind that Adamic nature you're going to go in and going to hell I'll let you get unless you get eternal life for being good to somebody or something but you people sitting here today they there's not a lot of gray area for us sitting here and man we're either going up or down you know too much you can't plead ignorance and then that's why I said it's a lovely place but you know what Jacob said he said the house of God is a dreadful place remember he went to Beth Ellen he saw the angels he said this is the house of God it is a dreadful place all right now let's read this let's go to number six and read it real quick I pasted my 45 piece live I'm sorry only by about 10 minutes so anyway let's read the what's going going up that life that begin not nothing along here but all the way up there eternal life Zoli God's own life comes down and dwells in the man and he is eternal with God and can't die that's what the word said I just think of it is there to eternal life I answer no you answer no you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life and that's the life of God this kind of life no matter what it is it's got an end to it listen pulse it to life I now live in other words my old life is d-a-d dead not divorced that's our problem we come - let me just tell you this we come to a state of sanctification nothing's dead yet it's dying dying but it's not dead because remember the unclean spirit goes out he's not dead he just goes somewhere else he comes back he's still life but he brings several more of his buddies and the state of the person but let me tell you something you drive him out and let God kill him by the word there's nothing to come back except God himself a man just think of it is there to eternal life you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's gotten into it and anything that had a beginning has an end but anything that has no beginning has no end and God said he would give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him and actually the life that thin us wasn't brought here by human nature nature give us a spirit but that spirit are the first life died that all right can say that without with a little interpolation we get the Spirit of God glory to God amen but I watch let's get way on over guys to number eight let's go to number eight because I want to get to something right here got it all right when God was Wednesday often when God was in theophany which was Christ in the making then that theophany became flesh and dwelt among us then that was to redeem he came from there down through this to redeem this creature give it life take it back up into the eternal one see there's only one eternal life and it lays in God alone and God only has eternal life and we have been privileged to become the sons of God then that word he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life the greek word zoe they are used for god's own life the creature that accepts him becomes a part of god and is just as eternal as god it that's right there's no reason for us to doubt it it's God's everlasting eternal word and everything that had a beginning had an end so where did where did sin begin sin begin at the Garden of Eden and sin has an end so David cried o Lord my God my soul is thirsty for then and dry land where no water is without loving-kindness is better than life there must be two different types of life and there is two types of life and when a man is born into this world he's nothing but a product of sin when he's born because he's from sexual desire and he's just a product of sin the Bible says he is he's born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Eliezer and yet he's got life but that life is perverted life that light was that life was Satan cannot create life to look even though it was Adolf Hitler even though it was you get the worst person God had to give that person life Satan cannot create a lot cannot give anybody life listen dog gets lost all the animals that's God's life it just doesn't have a soul put in it than all right that's right okay but he put it in us to make a choice Satan cannot create life he can only pervert what God has created Satan has no way there's only one creator God didn't talk about Satan can't heal and all the things now we see the different types of life that's the reason that this man is born as a product of Adam which were a product of sin from listening to his wife and the wife would the products of sin comes from Satan and Adam followed his wife out a perfect type of Christ going with his the bride to take her sins as item took the sins to be even left the Garden of Eden not deceived but willingly walked out with her soulless Christ not deceived Satan could not deceive him if thou be the Son of God he knew that he was but he deliberately walked out into sin for the church he's our sin bear and now everything that come out of that cycle of eternal life when that goes back into its cycle again it's that ceaseless eternity not one shape form of sin in any way will ever enter now here's one Baptist preacher believing holding notice that has got to be cleanse that person has got to be cleanse and there's only one thing can cleanse them that's the blood of Jesus Christ nothing else can do it that's the life we're looking for we have to live in life we do we still have a carnal mind because remember the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind even after you're born again listen I didn't have to fight so much when I was a sinner why just what were you fighting if you want to say a bad word when did you fight saying it no you just said it you didn't have to fight and go to liquor store that's what you did right but when we got the new life that killed that old life and you better on go back to the liquor store again unless you get some cough medicine maybe alright anyway get away from that one listen now what's going to happen is what's going to happen is we want to see now that this family that God is developed we know we have turn alive but now I want to something that we want to read here and let's go all the way guys over to number 11 that'll save time we'll read these two and then we'll be finished number 11 I mean number 10 sorry 10 10 there you go what do we do because watch now we brought you here with the new birth now I'm going to take you back remember I've always said that the seals sure it's a revealing of Jesus Christ it run around many times in the seal book he said the seals breaking shows what what that which was which is and what used to come in other words where you came from what you're doing here and where you're going now if I know that a man I use the GPS it's called God's predestinated seed it will get there I promise you with no error that will be not a recalculating in God's predestinated seed that GPS will land right where it supposed to land a man done all right I like brother and listen I'm telling you that's brother Joseph is good - let me get brother Joseph arose I got one morning amen don't you listen this is what we were talking about and he come up with something that was really neat I'm going to use it brother Joe's all right I can't see him slum we'll use it anyway brother Tim Jim's we were talking about you know relationship well remember Adam didn't lose his relationship with God he was the son of God when I'm a relationship if men my first cousin we're a relation because what we're family now you can't ever take that away you can't take that relationship but they lost fellowship and then brother Joe said what we need is revelation ship revelation ship to get us back to what fellowship we're not gonna lose our relationship it's always there remember that's what that's what that quote was I don't stay at them but I think God wanted me to say it now because when he said what did Jesus did he bring your inheritance no no your inheritance was before the foundation of the world your relationship never had a beginning or never had an end now that's in the mind of God but when you drop down to this other life yeah you've got to walk through sin but listen if you weren't in his mind in the eternal section you're not going to do it down here hey man I know as well as you do I don't believe it we came with any kind of eternal life in us the things I did when I was a sinner God wouldn't know we're in because God won't dwell in an unclean vessel but I had representation that one day somebody would quote the right quote or somebody would read the right scripture and it was what bark like lightning what the revelation ship takes me back to fellowship Joe I'm gonna use that not if it's copyrighted I'll pay you later huh but I think that was great because what brings us back to fellowship revelation shift how can to agree how can do what without a grant you really I mean come on people you can you can fellowship with somebody but if you don't have any common interest with each other it's going to be a real short fellowship amen but we're supposed to have a fellowship with God for an eternity so we must better be pretty close and have something to talk about with our Savior amen now look in building this family watch number 11 questions an answer what do we do well my dear brother st. hey brother my dear st. his sister before the foundation of the world when God created you in His image or created the man in His image and created the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself his self when he said led us to the creatures that he had made let us make men our own image in our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was a theophany all right now watch but once you really want to read this so now God created you in His image before the foundation of the world but not many times we and we know that it's not a person but though you've got a button remember you say well we were just in the thoughts of God but remember thoughts his artery turn and brother Brown said they're real because he had to see you in his mind I'm not talking I'm not talking I'm talking physically cuz I'm gonna read you a quote okay cuz remember God didn't take a picture you when you were eight ten or twenty years old down here nuke most of you had short hair I told them it burly's I said I look like Jesus but I denied like Jesus when I was twenty when I was twenty I had hair pretty long I look like Jesus but I Jordan that like him some of you girls had earring short hair you won't go back that one guard saw no no no let me read you a quote can I read your quote okay last one right here now look go to number eleven questions answers 1964 this is after the seal so it must be right I'm being mean sorry and this spirit who was occupied so much gases let's read that I want to read that that's good let's go back down son now look you take a cell you break it down from a cell and it comes in then to a cell and a cell into an atom and molecule and on down like that it finally it ends up into the unseen it goes from a natural something you put your hands on two gases from gases to acids acids in the gases gases on back like that till it finally all winds up to one little thing and that is spirit we had a spiritual Einstein that can that could say that mmm and this spirit who has occupied these gases it might not be the same gases but the features of what you are will be exactly what they are again see the spear it has controlled that now look if you don't have that Genesis 1:26 man inside of you how in the world is Doug going to know what you look like you saw God knows everything sure he does but he don't keep up with the Devils kids because they are getting older and older and older and I just read you a quote last Sunday where there theophany what they were old when they were down in hell amen hey listen I want to use this lose I don't say God doesn't care but he really doesn't care about the Devils kids they made a choice so in the judgement of the choice he had to reject them wasn't his fault it was their fault amen I don't think God doesn't care about them but really he really don't I mean he fought takes you through life he follows you through life he's going to make sure you get to that image amen and this spirit is not going to occupy these gases the spirit has controlled that and now in other words when you become a young man or a young woman and like God takes a picture of you no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it will be that will wind right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lines whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the earth that was calcium potash petroleum cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter that the whole earth is filled with that all right now paragraph 21 now look but now roll it up but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your bath down here first life because like I said before how many of you were not even the message of 20 years old girls who had short hair this when I had earrings now the way God's going to see you in the eternity no I don't think now this picture was taken what let us make man in our own image because listen when that second life comes in to you it's a new birth what does it do it turns you back into that image your hair is long sisters you know where earrings guys we don't wear alone hair what it's taking our body back into that image to match what's inside of us well that thrilled my soul when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy God saw you there hear not as people before there was a foundation of the world it was putting God's great file and then only thing it did was feature itself here for you to make your choice then become see then become a servant of God him for knowing it makes them a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative before there can be a negative there had to be a positive the gods forgot to start with therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing I like southern prophets and this hates the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real theme that is to come now you get it I don't care what they do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's great gallery up there it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you can burn it Fiat the lines do whatever you want to but remember that what brother I was talking about revelations 13 when your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world it wasn't just a name that was a face went with that name and that was at 18 20 years old that's your best not down here but already in God's mind because like I said listen to me when you got born again it turns you from that that first life took you into that but thank God Almighty that knew taking turns you in your whole your whole being turns back to that how do you think we're going how you think we'll have a body change we gonna change from old old we're gonna change from new top no we're going to change from old to that image right then and to me that is in his eternal section he's got pictures let's notice it prettier that's about 55 but anyway God takes him out of once and while I believe he just kind of looks too easy well we'll develop that in just a little while well they're getting closer so we're going to develop that one in just a little while and man because in God's mind remembers already finished done over settled you never did get old you never send a day in your life you came from the great eternal to what the display his attributes here on earth but I'll guarantee you one thing if you were in that book that profile cannot be destroyed because it's the Word of God that word of God is what made that image hey man that word of God is what made that image and when he said let us make man in our own image boom there it is all these children he'll ever have he has a hole and let us make man in our image why there was an image what it was all of us created in His image amen you loved the Lord all your to love God more than ever he has preserved you he has took you from nothing and made you something you think I'm insignificant that's your problem if you're born again you're just as powerful as God it I believe that there's got to be a time when we go well I don't know but I'll just what did I business there's only one I am and he said I am that I am so that's the one we need to look at you know what when Moses went to Egypt like girls always said when Moses went to Egypt Pharaoh said hey who's going to deliver these people you want you know you got an errand there and you can't even talk yourself I can't listen here you can't stand here he told Moses he said who's on deliverance because Moses I am I am took them people out of Egypt but he used a human man and for you and I musicians come for you and I to get out of here we're gonna have to realize that God is using you and I he's using his bride to fulfill what he saw before the foundation of the world amen now remember some of us has already went past at 18 to 20 years old so I've got to depend on the memory of God to remember what I look like and you know what that kid's business brother Louise that's his business that's what he promised he would do he made the promise we make a promise that when half the time we do it half time we don't amen I'll guarantee if God makes a promise he'll see it all the way to the end he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us he'll never turn us down I was thinking the other day you know brother Brian said well you know we always say well Satan this and Satan did this brother Berman said if you're a Christian said if you let Satan get to you he said you went out to meet him in other words he can't get you while you're behind the word he can't touch you but when you do something wrong or you goof up or you do something that's a little bonehead like I do what you've done is is you walked out from behind the Word of God now you didn't lose your relationship but you lost some fellowship by the round said the holy ghost of the gentleman he'll go out on the limb somewhere and he'll sit down and wait what wait for you to repent you didn't lose your relationship but you lost a little fellowship so by revelation ship you realize that he's sitting out there and that you need him right back here let's stand to our feet God's going to have a group of children have children he's already got him we're finite we didn't know I mean we were going to have but God is infinite he knew how many kids he was going to have there's not an extra one there's not an extra seat we got to try to feel there's not a like brother branham said there's not an extra soul somewhere that God's not going to feel no everything is perfect and I have to put my dependency on that promise that I was talking to ruff had that promise that that New Testament that testator would come and die to give me a new life a New Testament what in his blood what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus Hira Oh fresh cut is that blown [Music] make me why - no no cloud I know nothing but the blood of Jesus God a can force in our cold in the if not I have done nothing but makes me white as snow no water the buggies are cleansing for my quizzes Diwali nothing buggy the for my pardon my god oh that made me why - no no no no nothing but a blood this is all

nothing what about inspiration well Bob and I were talking about the inspiration of these songs you listen to these songs a man they're just so inspired but those people can be just as lost as lost to be but anointing could follow them people write a song and brother Brown stood there trying to go out and kill themselves commit suicide why because when anointing left them they do not act but you and I is Christian even though we do get anointing we do get refilling of the Holy Ghost we have a settling factor we have a factor that we can go back to and it will be it is settled that we don't have to go crazy we're already crazy a man we've already lost our minds amen amen we've already lost our mind we spoke to have the mind of Christ I was lost but now I'm found hey man I was blind but now I see oh [Music] that makes me why - no [Music] [Music] my precious is the flow that makes me white as snow [Music] ooh nothing the one can wash away
