[0:00] and whilst the Sunday School lesson this
[0:01] morning here and downstairs and we love
[0:03] you and thank you for all your blessings
[0:04] in Jesus name amen you can be seated God
[0:07] bless you
[0:19] good morning and God bless you
[0:21] it's good to be it's good to be back we
[0:23] had a wonderful time uh fellowshipping
[0:25] with the Saints up there brother Andre's
[0:27] little church
[0:28] and he sends his greetings back and uh
[0:33] and uh we sure I sure I was listening to
[0:36] all the services and everything working
[0:37] in the yard yesterday and I sure enjoyed
[0:41] brother John's Sunday school lesson and
[0:43] uh
[0:44] and and brother Willie Smiley I I really
[0:47] enjoyed that
[0:51] I'm thinking about brother brother John
[0:52] uh his Sunday school lesson there's
[0:55] there's so many things you know if you
[0:57] if you make the wrong decisions it's
[0:59] sure and your natural life it can sure
[1:01] make uh things a lot more difficult if
[1:03] you make good sound decisions it can
[1:05] make things a lot easier so
[1:07] it's uh anything we can do to make our
[1:10] natural Journey a little bit easier I'm
[1:12] in favor of it
[1:16] now to get things started this morning
[1:18] uh I just want to read a couple of
[1:20] quotes and then we'll read our scripture
[1:22] um just because you know Hebrews 11 is
[1:24] speaking about faith and uh
[1:28] and you you think about what faith faith
[1:30] really is is we got our natural senses
[1:32] and and to be able to contact this
[1:35] natural world but God has given us
[1:37] another sense to be able to contact the
[1:39] things that we can't see it's like a
[1:41] like a little antenna that you can you
[1:43] can know that that God's here in the
[1:45] building that you can know whether
[1:46] somebody's preaching the right doctrine
[1:48] that you can know
[1:50] um looking beyond the things that you
[1:51] can see that you can know
[1:53] that God is able to to bring things to
[1:56] pass that he promised and they're in a
[1:58] super sense he said the Sixth Sense come
[2:00] for this reason only that was to make
[2:03] the five senses in you deny anything in
[2:06] this contrary to God's word now they
[2:08] kind of think about this in the context
[2:09] of what we're studying on Abel and Enoch
[2:11] and and all the ones that are laid out
[2:14] in Hebrews 11 that that they're looking
[2:17] by Faith by faith in it new to build the
[2:21] Pyramid and Enoch walk with God and by
[2:23] faith Noah built an ark
[2:26] The Sixth Sense uh gives you the the to
[2:30] make the five senses and you deny
[2:31] anything this contrary to God's word
[2:33] that's what the Sixth Sense is for the
[2:35] scripture speaks of casting down
[2:37] reasonings
[2:39] the five senses will you can reason well
[2:41] now why should this man and why should
[2:43] but the Sixth Sense doesn't see that at
[2:46] all
[2:47] oh think about that the sixth sense that
[2:49] doesn't see the circumstances and so
[2:51] forth at all it's so far beyond it it's
[2:54] so much higher than it is until it don't
[2:56] even have any reasonings at all with it
[2:59] we believe it
[3:01] is far beyond anything that the five
[3:04] senses would have to say about it now
[3:06] get ready for a healing service see we
[3:08] believe it you walk by that sixth sense
[3:09] you talk by that sixth sense you live by
[3:12] that sixth sense you die by that Sixth
[3:14] Sense and Rise by that sixth sense that
[3:16] super sense something that's in you
[3:19] that's different from what the natural
[3:21] man is
[3:24] and in the unity of one God in the one
[3:26] church he said now what your eyes tell
[3:27] you what your mind thinks you I can't
[3:30] quit it I can't do it I can't stop doing
[3:33] this that's intellectual
[3:35] but something down in your heart says
[3:37] and you are my property remember listen
[3:41] to what your voice in the heart says
[3:43] calls us God speaking to you all of the
[3:47] things will fade just like the night has
[3:49] to fade which is the strongest the night
[3:52] or the day let the sun rise and see what
[3:54] happens to the night it just Fades and
[3:57] can be no more
[3:59] and now let's get to our scripture oh
[4:01] God we're so grateful to be able to
[4:03] gather around your word this morning
[4:04] Lord and as we as we study these things
[4:06] out I pray that you'll guide us through
[4:08] these scriptures to give us a greater
[4:09] understanding of what we can do with our
[4:12] faith and what faith was given for and
[4:14] God that you've given all these promises
[4:16] to us and I pray God that you'll just
[4:17] blessed by the way it is he's preparing
[4:19] Lord back there Lord that you'll help us
[4:21] help our hearts Lord Jesus and that your
[4:23] Lord will fill that Liberty Lord to be
[4:25] among us today granted Lord in your name
[4:28] so Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 says by
[4:31] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[4:34] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[4:36] he obtained witness that he was
[4:37] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[4:40] and by he being dead yet speaketh and
[4:43] will
[4:44] Lord will will kind of make some good
[4:46] progress today and and hopefully move on
[4:48] to verse five but you you kind of dive
[4:51] into this scripture a little bit and
[4:52] you'll find out that the faith Abel had
[4:54] that God actually come behind it and and
[4:57] testified of his gift that it was
[4:59] correct and that faith that was in him
[5:01] the life that that he lived actually
[5:04] began to even spoke beyond the grave
[5:06] that it still could be continued to
[5:08] speak and and Paul's seeing that saying
[5:11] here that he be being dead yet speaketh
[5:14] that his testimony still lives on today
[5:16] that he was right and we'll examine
[5:19] these things now the reason that he kind
[5:22] of lay in the background again that the
[5:24] reason why he offered up animal animal
[5:27] life was because he had a revelation
[5:29] that the problem was life
[5:31] and brother Brown said in law or Grace
[5:33] he said see what kind of a blood was
[5:34] that shed animal's blood animal life for
[5:37] a human life it just can't take away sin
[5:39] can't now when Jesus come and wasn't
[5:41] only human's life but it was God's own
[5:43] life himself
[5:45] that what was it that's what was in his
[5:47] blood now the reason why we labor
[5:49] belabor life so much
[5:52] I'll read a quote here in a minute where
[5:54] where brother Rome said the evidence of
[5:56] a real revelation of God is that you've
[5:59] got the life is on display what happened
[6:01] when Abel believed that God come down
[6:03] and Vindicated that and you see that
[6:05] life actually becomes the Vindication
[6:07] that your Revelation is correct or
[6:09] something Something's Happened in your
[6:10] life when when Cain saw that Abel's
[6:13] Abel's Revelation was Vindicated you
[6:16] know you think about God coming down
[6:19] with fire and consuming that sacrifice
[6:21] off the altar that Cain could look at
[6:23] that and say well something Supernatural
[6:25] is taking place and all these all these
[6:27] messages where brother Brown laid out
[6:28] for us this something Supernatural when
[6:30] God comes down and vindicates your life
[6:32] vindicates your Revelation with a
[6:34] changed life where somebody can look at
[6:36] you and see that God is God is living in
[6:38] you God's done something for you that
[6:40] you ain't like you used to be and see
[6:42] that's that's what it all comes down to
[6:45] life when somebody can see the Life of
[6:47] Christ in you that the fruits are on
[6:49] display there's there's a real
[6:51] Vindication and an expectation he said
[6:53] tonight with our Throne blessings in our
[6:55] heart by his grace to know that we were
[6:57] Sinners and he came and took our place
[7:00] and died as a sinner died in my place he
[7:03] died my death at Calvary he died all our
[7:05] deaths at Calvary and the sin me as a
[7:08] sinner he represented me and his death
[7:11] at Calvary he represented every believer
[7:13] tonight in his death at Calvary and God
[7:15] reconciling us and his love to us raised
[7:18] him up again for our justification
[7:22] and then the message law he said now a
[7:25] beautiful type of the believer today
[7:27] coming believing laying his hands upon
[7:29] Christ's head now look how he's talking
[7:31] about a Believer changed there at the
[7:34] altar or in his seat wherever he meets
[7:36] Christ laying his hands upon him at
[7:38] Calvary and realizing that all that
[7:39] Agony and suffering belongs to you and
[7:42] in your soul deep regrets and sorrow
[7:43] comes with your hands upon him you are
[7:47] changed you'll never be the same it's
[7:50] taken the condemnation away from you he
[7:52] under the law being a shadow the man
[7:55] went away Justified but still with the
[7:57] same desire now back there in the Old
[8:00] Testament went away with the same desire
[8:01] but in the New Testament because why
[8:04] because of life not animal life or man's
[8:07] life but God's life God's life God's
[8:10] life applied to you will have an effect
[8:12] in you he said let's say he was caught
[8:14] committing adultery and he offered a
[8:16] lamb and the lamb died in his stead he
[8:18] went right back out of the building with
[8:20] the same desire in his heart he'd come
[8:21] in with for the blood of bulls and goats
[8:23] says the scripture would not take away
[8:25] sin
[8:26] for it was only a type or a shadow of
[8:28] things to come because the life and the
[8:31] blood cell of the dying animal The
[8:33] Substitute was only the life of an
[8:35] animal but in this case here it is in
[8:37] this case it was not only the life of
[8:38] human but it was the life of God God the
[8:42] perfect one who came into the womb of
[8:44] the virgin in the form of the Holy
[8:45] Spirit the Creator himself bottling up
[8:48] in a blood cell he had no earthly father
[8:50] Mary was not touched by man she was a
[8:53] virgin and God himself overshadowed her
[8:55] or other words the Immaculate Conception
[8:58] that God himself created a blood cell
[9:00] what are you talking about this morning
[9:02] brother Bob I'm talking about why Abel
[9:04] why Abel offered a lamb because he knew
[9:06] the problem was life he knew the reason
[9:07] why they were were dying was because
[9:10] life got messed up and and uh you see
[9:14] that I'm just going to kind of skim over
[9:16] some of these notes just to kind of save
[9:18] time but Satan injected into the human
[9:20] race a carnal mind a carnal birth and
[9:23] carnal makeup but God injected by the
[9:25] New Birth the antidote for all of that
[9:27] to straighten up your life brother said
[9:30] in a blessing prophet he said bring us
[9:31] back to God not with an injection of
[9:34] Education not with an injection of
[9:37] religious Reformation not in the
[9:39] injection of some kind of man-made
[9:40] theology but an old-fashioned baptism of
[9:43] the Holy Ghost sent down from God out of
[9:45] heaven in a Pentecostal experience of
[9:48] burning out what the carnality and
[9:50] replacing in there the jewel is calling
[9:53] there of a son and daughter of God
[9:54] what's this got to do with Abel because
[9:56] when Abel believed right and God come
[9:58] down with fire and consumed that
[10:00] sacrifice
[10:01] until we do that brothers and sisters
[10:03] we'll still have bobbed hair makeup on
[10:05] sexy looking women and men drinking
[10:07] smoking and calling themselves
[10:08] Christians because they don't know
[10:10] better and in their heart that very root
[10:12] of carnality lays there
[10:15] [Music]
[10:17] look how in the unity of one God and the
[10:19] one church just to kind of kind of skim
[10:21] over the high points of this there's
[10:23] many people in that says that the Holy
[10:25] Spirit ain't real but he said there's
[10:26] tens of thousands and millions of them
[10:28] saying it's not so there's many enjoying
[10:30] the blessings of it that to show that
[10:32] the holy ghost is real and he says he
[10:35] fills you with the power he fills you
[10:36] with the spirit he fills you with his
[10:38] own divine nature and he changes your
[10:41] carnal nature into his nature then in
[10:44] this you become a new creature in Christ
[10:47] oh to think about that that the Holy
[10:49] Ghost just leaves you in the situation
[10:51] where you are but it actually changes
[10:54] your life it changes you and we'll we'll
[10:57] we'll get into that when we look at what
[10:59] Enoch's Revelation how he walked off the
[11:01] earth I I was kind of studying on a
[11:04] uh
[11:06] which other denominations believe in the
[11:09] Statue of perfect man and I found out
[11:11] that the Methodist actually believe in
[11:12] the Statue of perfect man and they use
[11:14] they don't call it maybe like that but
[11:16] they use Ephesians 4 13 that were
[11:19] growing into the unity of the perf to
[11:21] come to the full measure of a perfect
[11:22] man and they use that to speak about
[11:25] their doctrine of sanctification what
[11:27] they're really calling this is
[11:28] sanctification that we're growing we're
[11:30] growing to be more like God what what is
[11:33] it what is sanctification get rid of
[11:35] that carnal nature that God is God is
[11:37] changing you to be it's all based that
[11:40] life is that life is pushing out in you
[11:43] to change you from the way that you were
[11:45] to be more like him and that's why Abel
[11:48] brought that lamb and the True Vine and
[11:50] the false Vine brother Ram said here
[11:51] come little old label pulling that Lamb
[11:54] with a spiritual Revelation that he know
[11:56] that it wasn't fruit that brought him
[11:58] out of the Garden of Eden he knowed it
[12:00] was blood
[12:02] and life don't lay in plants like can't
[12:06] though he could just bring some stuff
[12:07] that he grew in the ground but life
[12:10] life the kind of life that would help
[12:13] Abel didn't lay in Plants it lays in
[12:16] blood
[12:17] here you come with a little string
[12:19] wrapped around a grape vine around that
[12:21] little lamb throwed him up there and
[12:24] said this is it Lord
[12:27] now now see when you come we could when
[12:29] you come to God with a real revelation
[12:31] of what his word is and you lay that
[12:33] before the Lord in prayer and say you
[12:35] said it and I I know what you're talking
[12:38] about and you come believing and it's
[12:40] real genuine faith God will come by
[12:42] behind that like he did with Abel and
[12:45] he'll vindicate it and prove it no he'll
[12:48] he'll bring it up off the page and
[12:49] manifested in your life in a real
[12:52] genuine manifestation of the
[12:54] supernatural power of God now now that's
[12:58] why life don't lay in Plants it's blood
[13:01] and that's why Christ had to die on the
[13:02] cross that's why that's why sitting here
[13:05] this morning we need the baptism of the
[13:06] Holy Ghost Jesus sitting there talking
[13:08] to Nicodemus and Nicodemus was looking
[13:10] at it from a fair sacred Pharisee
[13:12] perspective that just trying to
[13:14] understand things from an intellectual
[13:16] perspective but Jesus told him that
[13:18] which is born of the flesh is flesh we
[13:21] got to get away from the carnality the
[13:23] carnality of our original birth the
[13:25] carnality of the way that we think but
[13:27] that that which is born of the spirit is
[13:29] Spirit
[13:30] Spirit the spirit the life of God will
[13:33] change you and he said Marvel not but I
[13:36] said unto thee you must be born again
[13:38] you need the life of God to change the
[13:41] way that we change think the change the
[13:42] way that we that we were walking that we
[13:45] talk and and the unity of one God and
[13:47] the one Church uh brother Brown said but
[13:49] Abel by faith chose a lamb for it was
[13:51] blood and life that taken it and he drug
[13:55] him to a rock and hammered his little
[13:56] throat until he bled to death
[13:59] God said that's righteous Abel that's
[14:02] right how did it come to him by
[14:04] Revelation not by intellectual through
[14:07] his heart he knew it
[14:09] now those quotes we read about what a
[14:11] six the sixth senses so that God give
[14:13] you something the ability to look Beyond
[14:15] uh the natural and to to get in touch
[14:18] with the Supernatural and that's that's
[14:21] how Abel knew what to do because God
[14:24] revealed it to him
[14:26] in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 brother
[14:28] around said look over here at Jimmy
[14:30] Osborne in Louisville out there with
[14:31] that old Boogie Woogie rock and roll all
[14:33] Tommy rod and filth and on Sunday
[14:35] morning take the Bible and stand on the
[14:37] platform and preach what a disgrace no
[14:40] wonder the Bible said every table is
[14:42] full of vomit while we're living in a
[14:44] terrible day and people say oh they're
[14:46] very religious
[14:48] oh don't you know that the devil is
[14:50] religious don't you know that Cain was
[14:52] just as religious as Abel was but he
[14:55] didn't have the revelation
[14:57] that's it he didn't have the Revelation
[14:59] yet we all go to church but there is
[15:01] some that's got what
[15:03] is the difference life
[15:06] somebody's got the real genuine life of
[15:09] God working in their heart that's the
[15:12] ones that's got the revelation of Jesus
[15:14] Christ in their heart not by shaking
[15:16] jump but not by joining church but the
[15:19] revelation God has revealed him now you
[15:23] see you think take a look at that
[15:24] picture of Cain and Abel coming and
[15:26] they're they're both we know we kind of
[15:28] believer those points they're both going
[15:30] to church both paying their tithes both
[15:32] uh you know doing all the things it
[15:34] looks like a Christian would do but
[15:35] what's the difference one's got a real
[15:37] genuine Revelation that'll produce
[15:39] something and the other is just kind of
[15:41] going through the motions now there's
[15:43] the difference between just religion
[15:45] because we don't we don't want religion
[15:46] religion is what the Pharisees and the
[15:48] Sadducees had what that that will make
[15:51] them say well how can I divorce my wife
[15:53] and why can't why are you healing people
[15:55] on Sunday and just getting not having a
[15:58] true interpretation of what God wanted
[16:00] done with his word but a a real genuine
[16:04] revelation will produce a meek humble
[16:07] spirit of God living in a person that
[16:09] can deal with other people that can
[16:10] forgive and love and because it's Christ
[16:13] on display
[16:15] and I will restore brother Brown said
[16:17] now Cain was a Believer look at that
[16:19] Spirit what a beginning where it began a
[16:22] religious spirit and many people today
[16:24] are trying I hear ministers on the air
[16:27] trying to say that communism is the
[16:28] Antichrist oh brother I'm not a
[16:31] know-it-all I don't want to be that way
[16:32] God forbid but that's pure religious
[16:35] ignorance
[16:36] communism has nothing to do with the
[16:39] Antichrist Spirit Jesus said in Saint
[16:41] Matthew the 24th chapter of the two
[16:43] Spirits would be so close together and
[16:46] deceive the very elect if possible the
[16:49] Antichrist is religion
[16:52] not anti-religion
[16:54] the Antichrist the Antichrist is going
[16:56] to be sitting right there in church
[16:57] acting like a Believer an antichrist is
[16:59] just so close Judas was possessed with
[17:03] the Antichrist period and walked Plum
[17:05] almost to Pentecost with him rejoiced
[17:09] shouting in the camp meeting casting out
[17:12] Devils preaching the Gospel Power on
[17:15] display shouted had great joy but when
[17:19] it time come time for him to get the
[17:21] Holy Ghost he showed his he showed his
[17:24] colors of what he was and what's the
[17:27] Holy Ghost the life of God what's the
[17:30] difference between Abel and Cain
[17:33] the life of God showed Abel what what
[17:36] was true and what was what what the true
[17:39] approach was that was like life is in
[17:42] the blood
[17:43] how you think about these Pharisees I'm
[17:45] just I'm going to Breeze through some of
[17:47] these with the last few minutes of of of
[17:48] of Jesus you know Jesus uh he was he
[17:52] always dealt kindly with the ones that
[17:54] were fought believing him but he would
[17:56] deal harshly with the religious spirit
[17:58] with the religious people he he had laid
[18:01] on him he'd kind of conquer him upside
[18:03] their head if you say because a religion
[18:06] religion where's where's the biggest
[18:07] problem was it was somebody that's
[18:09] religious a religious proud person is
[18:11] going to stir things up a religious
[18:13] person will do like Cain and kill
[18:15] somebody will kill will kill a real
[18:18] believer they'll go around behind their
[18:19] back and destroy their influence and
[18:21] murder them a religious person is the
[18:24] person that Jesus always had the problem
[18:26] with in Matthew chapter 12 verse 10
[18:29] Jesus he was talking to the Pharisee
[18:31] behold there was a man which had his
[18:33] hand withered and they asked him saying
[18:34] is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days
[18:36] that they might accuse him you think
[18:39] about
[18:40] somebody in that state of mind that
[18:43] would think somebody being healed uh it
[18:45] would would uh would would be incorrect
[18:48] and we'll just kind of skim through some
[18:50] of these Luke Chapter 20. they washed
[18:53] him and sent forth spies which should
[18:55] feign themselves just men that they
[18:57] might take hold of his words so that
[18:59] they might deliver him under the power
[19:01] and authority of the governor and they
[19:03] asked him say master we know that thou
[19:05] sayest and teach us rightly
[19:07] neither accept acceptest thou the person
[19:09] of any but teacheth the word of God
[19:11] truly is it lawful for us to give
[19:13] tribute unto Caesar a no or no but he
[19:15] perceived their craftiness and said unto
[19:18] them why tempt Jimmy let trying to
[19:20] trying to lay a trap for him because
[19:22] they weren't really interested in
[19:23] whether they should pay their taxes or
[19:25] not they were trying to trying to get
[19:27] him in a fall
[19:28] and in Mark chapter 10 and the Pharisees
[19:31] came to him and asked him is it lawful
[19:32] for a man to put his what put away his
[19:34] wife and look what Jesus said for the
[19:36] hardness of your heart he wrote you this
[19:38] precept no there there's a good example
[19:40] of a religious person trying to fight an
[19:42] example to be mean to their wife trying
[19:44] to find an example to kick their wife
[19:45] out I've I've boy I've got a reason that
[19:49] I can and you know
[19:51] some some of y'all Old-Timers can look
[19:53] back and see see examples of that and
[19:55] different people's lives where they're
[19:57] trying to got a good wife or whatever
[19:58] somebody's trying to cook it for them in
[20:00] their kitchen and everything but it gets
[20:02] just the hardness of their heart they
[20:03] really just boot them out for the
[20:05] hardness of your heart he wrote you this
[20:07] precept but the life of God is going to
[20:09] make you act different the life of God
[20:11] will make you want to love your see
[20:13] there's a difference between religion
[20:15] religion and something real and genuine
[20:19] the life of God will make you want to
[20:22] straighten things that won't you want to
[20:23] make you want to sit down and talk talk
[20:25] things over with your wife and find out
[20:27] how to understand one another and and be
[20:30] a real genuine man or be a real genuine
[20:33] woman the hardness of your heart
[20:36] yeah
[20:37] in Luke chapter 19 he said when he was
[20:39] come nigh even now at The Descent of
[20:41] Mount of Olives the whole multitude of
[20:43] the disciples began to rejoice and
[20:45] praise God with a loud voice for all the
[20:47] mighty works that they had seen saying
[20:49] blessed be the king that cometh in the
[20:51] name of the Lord peace in heaven and
[20:53] glory in the highest and some of the
[20:54] Pharisees from among the multitudes said
[20:56] unto him Master rebuke thy disciples
[20:58] they didn't understand how somebody
[21:00] could be praising God and shouting in a
[21:03] good camp meeting and getting excited
[21:04] about the word that was coming forth and
[21:06] seeing God fulfilling his promises and
[21:08] he answered and said unto them I tell
[21:10] you that if thee should hold their peace
[21:12] the stones would immediately cry out
[21:14] because what religion religion is just
[21:17] kind of going through the motions
[21:19] through an intellectual understanding
[21:20] not understanding
[21:24] but but if they those people shout and
[21:27] then rejoice and they had caught a
[21:28] revelation of what was happening in
[21:31] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 19 and 20
[21:33] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[21:35] these least Commandments and shall teach
[21:37] men so he shall be called the least in
[21:39] the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever
[21:42] shall do and teach them the same Shall
[21:44] be Called great in the kingdom of heaven
[21:46] and look what Jesus said for I say unto
[21:48] you that accept your righteousness shall
[21:51] exceed the righteousness of the scribes
[21:53] and Pharisees he shall in no case enter
[21:56] into the kingdom of heaven
[21:58] so your righteousness has to go higher
[22:01] than the righteousness of the scribes
[22:03] and Pharisees now you think about the
[22:05] people of that day thinking man these
[22:07] these Pharisees and these religious
[22:09] people that I look up to so much they
[22:11] they are really righteous and for Jesus
[22:14] to say your righteousness has to exceed
[22:16] the righteousness of these people
[22:18] how is your righteousness going to
[22:20] exceed the righteousness of a good
[22:22] religious person by Revelation
[22:24] revelation of God's word
[22:27] and questions and answers brother Adam
[22:29] said if you watch the spirits that come
[22:31] up out of Genesis and begin to raise up
[22:33] watch that real classical High classical
[22:35] Church worship look at it back Yonder
[22:38] and Cain look at it today comes right
[22:41] down and moves on down through into the
[22:44] Pharisees and there's two six of them
[22:47] Pharisee and sadducey see moves right on
[22:51] out and look at it today in Catholicism
[22:53] and great moves like that great
[22:55] beautiful places but look at Abel with a
[22:58] Little Lamb
[23:00] Abel with his little lamb
[23:02] God's provided a way of dealing with sin
[23:04] he said here he come pulling the little
[23:06] lamb the lamb knowing that death laid
[23:08] near him pulling back I wonder what kind
[23:11] of a death that was when this little
[23:12] fella knowed he was coming and he laid
[23:15] him upon the rock
[23:16] pulled back his head he perhaps didn't
[23:18] have any knives or lances then so they
[23:21] just took a sharp Rock and began to chop
[23:22] on his Little Neck did you ever hear a
[23:25] lamb die you hear the most pathetic cry
[23:27] you ever heard when you hear a lamb
[23:29] dying anyways they beat him across his
[23:31] little jugular veins with this rock and
[23:33] the blood spurting out bathing his
[23:35] little wool God looked down
[23:38] and said that's it
[23:40] what did he speak of it spoke of some 4
[23:44] 000 years later when the Lamb of God was
[23:47] hanging on the Rock of Ages and the
[23:49] judgments of God of The Sinner Man was
[23:51] hanging there and his bloody locks
[23:53] tripping around his shoulder speaking
[23:54] Abel couldn't understand what the lamb
[23:57] was saying and Jesus when he died spoke
[23:59] in an unknown tongue my God my God why
[24:02] hast Thou forsaken me he was God's lamb
[24:05] dying on the altar the innocent for the
[24:07] guilty God dealing with sin in that
[24:09] manner nothing at all you can do God has
[24:13] already did it you have to accept it and
[24:16] by Sovereign Grace believe it and God
[24:19] will vindicate your faith by giving you
[24:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[24:24] and that's what happened when not not
[24:26] the baptism the holy ghost that Abel God
[24:29] gave Abel but God certainly Vindicated
[24:31] his faith and we'll stop on this Abraham
[24:33] said in the message presuming what was
[24:34] the difference as the musicians come
[24:36] what was the difference in Moab up on
[24:38] the mountain with seven altars and seven
[24:40] Rams and Israel down in the valley with
[24:42] seven altars and seven rounds but both
[24:45] of them keeping the Commandments of God
[24:46] both of them trying to do it but God
[24:50] Vindicated Israel how did Cain when he
[24:53] made an altar just as pretty or prettier
[24:55] than Abels he offered fruits he'd give
[24:57] his tithes he brought his income into
[25:00] the house of the Lord
[25:01] he knelt on the altar he bowed himself
[25:04] he prayed he worshiped just as sincere
[25:07] as any man but God Vindicated Abel by
[25:12] consuming his sacrifice
[25:15] God Vindicated
[25:17] Abel's faith
[25:19] something Supernatural took place and
[25:22] we'll stop on that note God bless you
[25:24] [Applause]
