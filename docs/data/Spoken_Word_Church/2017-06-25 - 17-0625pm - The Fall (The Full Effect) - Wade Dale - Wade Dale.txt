JOSHUA 5:13
»     13     †      ¶  And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
»     14     †     And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?

song leading and I should appreciate that everybody's got a job to do amen that's what makes us unique we do it not because we have to we do it because we do it for him don't do it for ourselves we do it for him by the way of announcements got one announcement I want you to all petition on your calendar July the 14th that is two Fridays or three Fridays from this week coming up by the Tim hem just having a special meeting on Friday night at 7:30 at his Church in Bessemer City which is about two and a half hours from here and the guest speaker is me so y'all can come and enjoy 7:30 we're going to be up there and and have a meeting we've been trying to get both Tim for a long time and Lord he's got 20 ministers I don't know how in the world he does it anyway so but he's going to have a special meeting we were going to have it on Saturday night but something came up so we're going to do it on Friday night so if you want to come and be in the service just put that on your counter you out of 14 7:30 so good to be in the house of the Lord got your Bibles let's turn to 2nd Corinthians 5 we're going to continue kind of our thought from last one day we answered those questions I think maybe one of them was weird we need to maybe address a little more today but I want to talk just a little while on one subject that that may help us it's like brother Dale said if Peter kept reading his quotes you're going to hear them again if we get to them so Allah who is this Melchizedek and different things so we are we're going to speak today we're going to stay on the fall but we're going to look at the full effect and then for a subtitle to life's not to lives Li ves to life's all right property guard talks about to life's LIF is not wise life's to life's so let's bow our head before we get started family Father we pray Lord that you'll be with us again today Lord you be the active participant in this service you be the speaker you'd be the hear you're the only one that can reveal Lord we pray that we will let this sink down deep in our heart become part of us it'll help us on our journey Lord as we continue to strive and try to serve you father we pray for the ones that are sick and not with us the ones that are traveling ones that are doing other things Lord the missionaries on the foreign fields bless them Lord give them fruit for their labor and be with them too Lord in the next month we know that they're coming in for the camp meeting in August and from all over the world just be with them Lord and keep them safe other forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord heal the ones that need healing father but most of all the ones that are since 8 we pray that you touch their soul bring them into this body Lord this wonderful body that there's no other family like this family Lord there's no other family like the family of the Lord Jesus Christ father just be with us further of this service in Jesus name we pray amen second corinthians 5 verse 1 for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens all right you noticed that doesn't say heaven that says heavens all right we may get into that but we may not because I got another little path I want to go down but we need to read this for in this week groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven got it one says heavens that says heaven all right if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked I was thinking about what daddy said today you know the thinker you know he's like he's naked and he's like this and they put him everywhere he's wondering where he's clothed here everybody that put him you know made him they've all made him naked he's out in the middle of a park somewhere doing this well he's wondering where the clothes are the somebody's go to put on him but anyway that was just something I was thinking this morning for a we that are in this time were not grown being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life all right now let's go to Galatians 2 verse 20 because I want you to see this I didn't see it in this way so last night I was reading I was thinking about the - light - lights Allah is not lives and watch what Paul said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live so nevertheless he's got he's a living human being all right yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live which means he lived another life previously but this that's where you get you to life's from and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you may be seated in the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word let me get all this put back together here where you going you leave it okay no I go I guess no I think I guess I'm self-sufficient man I can do this why I'm self-sufficient you think I look like I'm starved don't I know how to cook I got in there last night in June was making she was making breakfast and I said I want some potatoes and fried potatoes and onions high fried potatoes and onions yeah that's what I thought no I you know what I need I might hold this back numbers could y'all forgive me can everybody see that he might see me no good I may have to have a piece of tape hey Bob wait Bob can you bring me some tape that back part is broke and I taped it up so I think he may left the building too so anyway let's get back to what we were talking about last Sunday all right so bye all right with that what I'm going to do is is we're going to like brother Dale talking about we're going we're talking about Redemption so we got to come to a place I gotta have a tape yeah cause every time I push on this thing the back starts falling you are worth something that is wonderful thank you good job Donnie did leave Danny he left the building buy some duct tape it'd be a lot better but this is all right that's 200 mile an hour duct tape works fine now all right we got it we good there you are darling all right so what we were talking about last Sunday is this man that we call it he it was started with the logos remember all right we come down and brought in that word theophany everybody all right say man all right so we brought that it was a man that was speaking and it was white it was the Word of God listen God cannot say anything outside of his word he doesn't speak idol there's no Idol words and God everything he speaks when he speaks something happened all right he doesn't just carry on a conversation for the sake of conversation know what he believes what he says all right he believes his own work all right so this life that he is which he is he is and I'm going to read it in a little while but brother Branham called him King theophany amen that makes him King I mean that makes him the only theophany the only theophany there really is is God himself and then and out of him comes the word or what was inside of him like me and you like I want you to understand that because me and you we have conversation and and you know brother Hal and and Tony gotta wear got we all got talking about Bigfoot well now we know one thing for sure there's not a Bigfoot there's some people with big feet there's not we could take anderson and run him through the woods back there and they would have thought it was sasquatch but you see that's an idle word though that's that's nothing God doesn't do that God doesn't just sit back and go I think no when he he has a purpose for everything that he does everything every move God makes that's why the Bible is the brother branham said is the perfect Word of God man there was no addition there's we're not going to get to heaven or we're not going to get to this great position and go we need another Bible or we need another word we don't need another word what from the beginning coming out of this great fountain of this theophany man is exactly what me and you need man alright now we come to this person which is only one person a man but many titles and we'll read some of them in the Bible he when we get down here a little bit further but we know what happened in the fall so what happened in the fall when God spoke the word the word came forth in Genesis 1:26 to multiply and replenish the earth subdue the earth do all these great things God blessed them well that was what that was a man speaking what his children into existence that was Poppa God and man you got to understand one thing Adam was the ruler of the earth he was a son of God but he was not the God and then he's not King theophany he's part of King theophany you and I are part of King theophany but you and I are not the fullness of the Godhead bodily man all right we remember last Sunday he's the big G and if you'll read your Bible it when it says ye are gods it's a little G it's not big G so if we keep that in order he's the big G he's the creator he's the one that speaks and it happened but now being that we have this in our genealogy when you come down to here we're just like our daddy just not the fullness so we're not King theophany but we are part of King theophany and we anything that comes from God is eternal that is a part of God right all right so that's the eternal life okay so that's one life eternal I love that word and Lewis stole stole my quote this morning thanks a lot Lily we were talking about grace I said Knox not grace it's amazing grace you see what he said that Dave use them a quotes man will charge you for that one but look we have God in this is all eternal life Satan does not have eternal life Satan is not a creator Satan is a pervert err he perverts everything he touches amen because what glock told us to multiply and replenish the earth in this theophany form that he created were formed before the foundation of the world Genesis 1:26 man before we were put in flesh he told us to multiply and replenish the earth well Satan was not telling a lie to Eve saying you need to multiply and replenish the earth he just told her a different way of doing it than what King theophany wanted us to do alright King theophany is always true always right always eternal life amen because we're going to see that there was another life that came in li Fei once you know once a life lives its life but God is the only eternal life which never had a beginning never have an ending like brother nel teddy just as much that way is this way we try to come this way a lot more than we go that way but God is always ever-present he's the I am he's the creator no one else can create amen all right now sure God called us that's why I let me tell you something about this message and about the Bible you can make statements like what I just made that God is the creator and we're not but then it but then we're called a little critter see what I'm saying is that on that onion peel you got to peel that layer back you got to run it through the filter of your Holy Ghost and know what I'm talking about amen and everything because you can take what brother Brown says and you can find a quote totally opposite let's stand up in the dress the third person of the Trinity he talks about in one quote that I gave you last night he talks about the Trinity well there's no such thing as a Trinity a property God never believes in a Trinity right but he said Trinity run it through your filter you know there's not a Trinity if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why that I see now more than ever if we don't have the Holy Ghost we will absolutely take it in our own Flint right we will we will slant it what what they do Satan can't get the Holy Ghost bless his heart well that's why he slapped everything he can't stand the pure Word of God he can't stay on the true word he has to slant it what and his angle amen God is pure and true and he is eternal and that's what we must depend on I have to hook myself to eternity amen because it's constant and then it doesn't do this but now Satan what did he do he broke that thing off right brought us down into time where we're now in time brother Brown said time began after the fall okay and I'm like brother Tim Humes and he made a good point of the day he said why do we have to bring 30 or 40 quotes with us when we come to preach we should be to the point now to where we can at least if you have never read the quote verbatim you should run it through your filter and that filter could should say that ain't nothing but the truth that ain't nothing but the truth that's exactly what he said amen not-not-not you know bro they'll read quotes I got 15 of them right here but what does it do though for the younger ones are for some that are not that are still in kindergarten of course you got one to the born-again when they're born again you're a babe and you got it you got to grow up so you have to preach all of them but we don't have to we don't have to proper it's not theory anymore God's Word is never a theory it's a fact all right Satan brains theories but we have to go by the facts the Word of God and I have to and I you'll see me using this where I have to hook myself back to that eternal life amen because without eternal life the life that I have before Paul said the life which I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God but the one I lived before I lived I'll read it in a minute remember you lived in the world you lived in the world the world is what influenced you that life is what influenced you from the day you were born he said it doesn't matter if you never told a lie in your life you'd born a lot that's right you say well I didn't lie didn't steal see we put what we do is we make a list well I didn't do that I didn't do that I didn't do that I didn't do that addenda left any one of them so let's don't list you know like Bob was talking like somebody was saying about statue of a perfect man they was talking about somebody could still cut their hair and this is someone another church they're teaching was it even at faith that you can still a woman can still cut her hair and you know a man could drink and cuss and smoke and then up here's where you get to real holy go I know folks all that should have went away at sanctification before you get to the baptism of the holy go hey ma'am the cleaning of the stage is what we've always had wrong he said well I don't drink because I have the Holy Ghost no you don't drink on your thanks pot okay that all right go now here's eternal life now what happened in the garden was is that Satan brought his slant of the Word of God and God you know think about this morning when brother Dale was preaching what about a man that has so limited himself that there's not an atomic bomb in this world could blow up Jesus Christ there's not a chemical that you could create that would even harm him there our world that are floating around out there that God create this man Christ created yet he decided to come down in the human body and go through all this Willis he decided to show himself limit himself I mean the one that just brother Brown said when he saw Christ hanging out he said he didn't say a word to him to be low like he could create world just by looking at the man and here we got this man down to where he so in a simplified form he walked with us on the earth he talks with us on the earth he he came down in fellowship with us amen what a mighty God because that's low gosh this logos is was the speech that come out of God all right and then we called we brought in the theophany which the opening an Italian is Theo is God and financed the show so to show God all right so that's what happened in our mind remember in God's mind he never was all these floating like brother Dale was talking about he never was he always loved the man he always was eternal he always had these thoughts he always had these attributes he never gained anything amen he never gained one thing but for you and I to understand this man he had to step down not even down here he had to step down and and form so that you and I can see now see I can see even you go to Hebrews 10 and 5 a body thou has prepared me okay now we know that was the natural body of Jesus Christ but a body see it right here he's preparing me a body that theophany is that is that is God and all of his children and then you say well that's one listen God can be one and 10 million just like him and have the same theophany Christ created all things they men I thought Paul said it with Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you somebody in India somebody and Africa somebody in Alaska at the same moment Christ in you the hope aboard it does not make him any smaller or it doesn't make him any less powerful you know what makes him that me and you that carnal mind that began right here that narrowed atom down to a place to where he couldn't even control the earth anymore he couldn't even control the earth anymore he was lost and and brother Ryan had asked that question I don't think I really covered it you can't lose your Genesis 1:26 that's eternal life what did Adam lose he lost fellowship Adam lost the connection he had with God before the fall he didn't lose his Genesis 1:26 man listen I'll read it here in just a minute that there was a cloud well I read it last Sunday there was a cloud that came over Adam to where it where did it come from right here Adam had never had to think about death before Adam had never had to think about children before him bringing them like by sex but he never had to think about a lion it was going to eat him he never had these thoughts he it was no fear but when all this happened he said I was afraid so when that fear came involved in God said where you argue at him he said I was afraid now before that Adam had no problem to walk straight up the dog and say hey daddy how you doing that's much of a relationship that's why we got to get back to that relationship I was telling Bob let me give you this little pointer and it may be totally wrong but it's just my fault anyway Paul went to the third heaven installed things that he could not talk about right why Paul was a prophet but remember Paul was not he didn't have the Bible to fall back on he was writing the Bible I want to know and I'm going to go back and look I'm study I want to know what this Corinthians was written before he went across or after because if he went across the curtain of time and saw things he couldn't talk about I'll guarantee when he came back to this earth he said for we know if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we got one waiting cuz I saw it right that's what our deal is now people the book has been open Paul was writing the book all those Old Testament Saints was writing the book they were all writing the book that's why the prophet of God said everyone look to this day why because the books open we can understand we can even by even by natural thinking know that a prophet of God when he went across the curtain of time you know what he saw because he came back told her you know why cuz he could explain it Paul couldn't explain it but Paul maybe later on and I'm going to find out because it makes a lot of sense Paul went across and he's like because remember brother branham being a prophet up until 1960 he thought that if he went across a curtain the time for jokes daughters here hey how are you good to see you - hey it's good to see you again sure enough God bless you but brother Branham he thought that that if he went to heaven that he'd just be moving in a safe setting on a cloud but he said I'd see brother Neville and I said hey brother Neville couldn't shake his hand right that was his revelation at the time he didn't know like Paul he couldn't express that they got bodies like until he went there then when he went there and come back thank God he couldn't keep a secret when he came back he said I saw him and there and it's all that word that brother Branham had he could look back to Paul's writing in Corinthians and all these different ones and see that they were embodied he said they were what theophany they went sea off anybody's now I'm going to read it to you the minute we get to it but don't we'll get it next Sunday that brother Brown says I don't I don't get hung up on the material things I really don't like to say that I'm really not going to stay up at night and study about what that body's made of over there that's immaterial to me all I know is one thing for sure I got to feed it over here I got to make sure I got it over here and when I've got it over here if this earthly tabernacle dissolved I don't have one set up in a closet somewhere over in glory because remember it says eternal in the heavens but then this there's one that closed upon with our house which is from heaven it's got to be down here and then because from heaven is where this comes from and then that's where this come from when what happened was and we'll read it right here in just a second what happened was is this bar called time kept glide from coming down into a being human being the way he wanted to he couldn't get into the soul of man and listen the soul of man is not a spot I am my soul is me there's not a little dot right here the whole firing next mechanism of what you see is my Fiat me I'm not it's not it's not it's me go Jesus when he came back it was what him and then but God could not come he was barred by his own word I'll put enmity a division in other words I can't come through the way I want to come through but I'm coming anyway I'm coming anyway so what he does is he comes through the Old Testament as what Jehovah and all those titles now really not to correct you but I look it up the other day the it was Jay hv8 is the way it was written instead of jb8 you it's Jay bah and what man done is put to eat the O and the a and made it Jehovah but the original was Jay h vh I looked it up in the Jewish website j h vh was the original they couldn't pronounce it so man put vowels in to make it geo and a to make it jehovah alright so now cuz you know what you got people that looks on the internet and they see something different they go why did you do that why did you saying that well that's what it is go there j HB h but man didn't understand it but what happened to this Jehovah God he comes down one time he comes down two times in a man called Melchizedek than all right now I'm going to pick a few because the three that I pick in the Old Testament is going to be ones that a body appeared to somebody not an angel listen an angel is not in that theophany light you and I are in that theophany because they don't have a soul remember brother Ron says even Satan didn't have soul takes an angel Saints not a man Satan is an angel angels are different he said angel heard everything man all right now so we come down with CML Cassidy Abraham made him in the first part of his journey amen which was what they brother Dale said this morning that was a pre figure of what Christ was going to be but that was not him because he could not die when he met Abraham he met him in a flesh body but it was not the flesh of God it was just never had brother Brown said he threw up some potassium and some potash and let it drift over his body and he walked up and met Abraham then he disappeared went right back into that theophany now remember I want to I want you to get something though God didn't lose anything when if all happen God didn't lose anything at all because I want to the full effect of the fall is how all this great beautiful picture that we're fixing to see came about without the fall you wouldn't have all these titles of God you wouldn't have us being lost and look back and need a savior like I said before the love of God put us on freewill and man the love of God gave us a choice and listen the only way you can have a choice is to have a soul animals don't have a choice they don't have a soul but that soul we're going to read in a minute is the theophany listen Adolf Hitler had a soul that came from God yes he did sure he did you should all like to show God yeah I did but put him on free moral agency to choose whether he continues on that path I'll read it in the minute I got quote and this is what I believe anyway a sinner hasn't the awesome cuz it's the farm into the ant it's a soul it's a soul you only you can't have a soul and not make a choice so God put everybody in one place give everybody a soul and attacks our nature to that soul I'll read it a minute go that's your old atomic nature that's the nature of the Fallen part that you come you come follow all right go down no calves ain't met Abraham then milk I didn't met Abraham again at the end of his journey right when he was 99 years old made him at the end of the journey told him all these things so there's two times that God comes down in that King theophany puts on a little dust and shows yourself give him a pre figure actually to me he hid himself he didn't reveal itself he hid himself he was revealing himself to Abraham because Abraham said Lord a man nobody else around him had a revelation he said Lord now then works the next one Moses obviously and then and I came upon something last night what do some study we might find something I know if you go to that word when Moses when the book the Bible says the bush was on fire okay it says the bush was on fire now let me tell you what the Hebrew let's consider bout that word fire that word fire pull it up it's Hebrew look right here they interpreted that as a theophany was accompanying this supernatural fire we know it was we know what we know Moses saw the fire Moses heard the voice but behind that fire was that King theophany that was Almighty God that was the I am of the I am he was standing there he was the accompanying theophany of what what he was is in Moses in revelation at the time God was hid God was hid hiding himself in simplicity but what revealing himself because what happened to Moses later on Moses comes up one day and and says God I saw you in the bush I went to Egypt and I spoke everything you told me to say I brought these bunch of rebels out here you've told me to speak to them I've done things right I've done things wrong but I want to see who you are I want to see you I want to actually not just understand you I want to physically see you so God said okay go hide yourself in the cleft of the rock we know the story and when he saw that body go by he didn't see some floating body the Bible says he saw the back part of AMA n now you say well what was that with Jesus Christ not in his human form at the time but that was mr. King theophany showing himself to Moses hey man he come down out of returning he's the only one that can move I'm still I'm still working on those dimensions because God in the seventh dimension no one can go there but he can go anywhere he wants to so he stepped out of that seventh dimension down into higher dimension and showed this up just a little bit and I promise you one thing I don't think Moses was surprised I don't think Moses was going to expect some ball of light to go by or some bush burning do you know walk my friend when he saw that man he said that's what I thought you would that's what I thought you would you talk to me like a man so you must be a man can you seem like that can you see with all this revelation we got so it struck me the other day when brother Dale says do you see when you pray do you pray to somebody or you just praying we eyes close and it's just out into the hello somebody or you just do like I'm doing now I'm just going to talk to him I don't have to close my eyes I don't have to close my eyes we do by we do in reverence listen we do in reverence let's don't be let's don't have a preacher come up here and he said let's bow our head and pray and everybody's going no bow your head in reverence but when you talk to God and you need to talk to him I've had to talk to him on my lawnmower now like brother Ryan said that's my burning bush is my lawnmower now if I close my eyes I'd probably run over Susan's plants and she'd kill me I'd see my king tee off and he real quick but I keep my eyes open while I'm praying without ceasing I'm talking I'm talking to the man I'm not talking to some spirit or some or some Idol or I'm talking to you know why because I know who I'm talking to Moses finally he says god I want to see who I'm talking to and then he sees the man saw him in that supernatural fire listen Moses what a dummy he knew that if that Bush wasn't consumed it had to be a supernatural fire and there had to be a supernatural being behind that part but when God stepped out of that and just said okay Moses I'm going to walk by animal what you see can't let you see my faith I'll let you see my nowhere so the incense shadow it's a shadow he's gone man he said why was he in flash again who cares who cares I don't care I don't I don't I'm not gonna sit here and worry about what this the off anybody's made out of there's only one thing I know for sure that them across the curtain of time we're solid is this table and they need a flesh body when they come back here and that's the thing that we're going to live through eternity because brother Ron said they're not in their right to be conditioned so there's a part of them that's still here with the connection we'll get to that in a minute everybody all right say man all right so now who's the next one the next one is a man named Joshua Joshua 5:13 let's read that I wonder I want you to see something you think well maybe this is just somebody that Joshua saw but watch what happens so you have to look at the character in the attribute behind what happened with Joshua same thing with Moses don't just take Moses for his word Moses saw the back part of a man Joshua this is after they had the scripture before that if they had just went into the Promised Land they were eating the old court of the land everything was good because they were getting everything together and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a spook there stood a light there stood a burning bush there's to the man over against him with a short draw this guy was doing he wasn't just standing now you meant business but why was he there watch and Joshua went unto him and said unto Him art thou for us or for I ever said you know what didn't have a revelation at that moment who he talking to you because you don't ask god those questions right no but God's got that amazing grace lluís amazing wake up so you hear one thing are you for us are you for adversary and watch when he speaks but Nathan Nate but as captain of the host of the Capitol lor DMI now come and Joshua would have not worshiped this being had it not been God and then had he not been King theophanies Joshua would not have got that watch he fell on his face of the earth and did worship and said unto Him what staff my lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoes have you ever heard this before have you ever heard this before that same I am told Moses to take your shoes off Oh your foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy and Joshua did so remember Joshua not not degrading Moses but Moses was a prophet Moses couldn't go across the promised land but Joshua it's a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Joshua is a type of the placing of the people in the land so his revelation showed him immediately a man face-to-face and then and he got down in worship this man knowing that was Almighty God and when he said loose your shoes I don't think Joshua took his time I think he kicked them off or in the bushes somewhere because he knew he was in the presence of Almighty God but where did that captain of the host go he dropped that body went right back into the in another dimension Amen so he showed himself several times down through the Old Testament but remember the proper God told us that Melchizedek became Jesus Christ a man not another person by a different person that's why he could stand and say before Abraham was I am because he'd been there he'd been aligned if he had to be a man he would have been lying if he said well I know he knew and we read it in just a little while maybe we connect Sunday on who dis Melchizedek that's why Jesus he came here the Word of God we had to be made into the image we had to be made the Word of God we didn't come here to word a god man is that all right listen we didn't come here special now in the mind of God we were special in the mind of God we were absolutely already saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and already sit in heavenly place but now he's up here and we're down here he's looking through he's looking through his he's looking through what he has always got to look back to the word there's therefore now no condemnation we have to start looking back toward the word look at that word of God look at the word let the word tell us what we are instead of us going oh smoke I don't drink I don't come I go to church I believe the Prophet devil does too he's on top of the list he gets here to church for you too and he never goes to sleep never goes to sleep but he's not the flesh body either so I know you live in a flesh body so that's all right but the Word of God King theophany now did it stop any of this no no it just kept unfolding yourself down through Moses but remember one thing's for sure one thing's for sure no one in this time period had that Genesis 1:26 men in their soul Moses as great as he was had an anointing Joshua had an anointing they all had an anointing but they were not sons and daughters of God they were not part of this Genesis 1:26 man but remember because of that Genesis 1:26 man because of the word that was spoken already like I telling them this morning we're on the fifth seal because of the word of God God God has got to give that fifth seal Jew eternal life you say you can't make God listen you can make God do something call him on his word you have if you program take God's love for you to tell him what he's worth then why call him on the word that fits healed you you've shown me one thing why they should have eternal life show me one they know one there's not one there do so what but God said I'll not forget that's how they get it God said I blinded you so that you can come in that's why I told them this morning I said let's not be so let's don't put that fifth seal Jew down if they hadn't been a fifth seal Jew they went to be in Genesis 1:26 man they wouldn't been a Gentile bride called out in the church ages it would have been the Jews would have accepted Christ at Calvary and then they would have went right on into the Millennium because remember the Millennium is not to us it's to the Jews so there wouldn't have been like I said last Sunday they wouldn't have been the gap where the seven church ages are you'd have Jesus Christ here died they accepted him and go right there and then go right in the Millennium but no he blinded them for seven churches right therefore he said I will not forget now Israel you went whoring Israel I divorced you but I won't forget you you'll be servants now you won't be my children and then that all right so then we see this theophany now watch this the object in theophany is she showing itself but he's having to leave he's showing himself but he's having to leave a man he can't come down and reside in a human being because remember the blood of bulls and goats never eradicated sin it covered it you still had I'm still with dark but it covered it so God what'd he do he saw that he had to he had to come off at Judgment he had to come off that judgment he if we ni seize the blood he couldn't cross that Sistine there's no way doesn't matter what was behind that door he told them put to put the blood over the doorpost and I will pass over you he had to do what his word said so that's what he did he just kept till he comes down to one place where this King theophany finally became flesh in Jesus Christ now I'm just gonna make a cross okay that all right let's read Isaiah 9:6 now here see you wouldn't had any of this you wouldn't had any of what I'm fixing to read for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given here's the full effect to the fall he didn't have to come hadn't been to fall right Bryan to us a child is born unto us a son is given them the government shall be upon his shoulder his name should be called a wonderful called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there should be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this now let's go to isaiah 44:24 next one thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself he don't need no other like I said this great guy try to think about that sometime think about a God that you could you know all the horribleness that we could throw at him doing flinch all the horribleness that Satan can throw all the horribleness that man could throw at God not going to hurt that King theophany there's nothing ever hurt this King t this King theophany never fails it don't fall and man there's no fall in it that's why I said once we realized that when we come to a place that that thing resides and we got to go back to that we got to go back to that that's what we got to go back to because the words that multiply and replenish the earth that's what we're doing right now Bob and I were talking to the back Paul the great Apostle Paul he's going to be a prophet he's going to write 80 percent of the Bible yet he needed somebody from the body not another prophet not a preacher God said and now I'm gonna send you somebody and Ananias is like really Lord that guy's kid that guy's killing us he said I won't use lay hands on him he said cuz the Holy Ghost has got to come through the body and you are the only one that I can trust to do that or he would ask somebody else so I said about brother Branham he couldn't he's nobody could have been the prophet in this age for him because because he's the one that fits the bill he's the one that fit everything God needed right regardless of the things he did that we say was wrong come on big deal he fits the bill he fit the word perfect he was absolutely a word prophet because he came by the Word of God and man the only thing is is I don't believe he was deity because he came to a second sex birth okay he had deity residing in him but he was not did he no way no he had babies I'm sorry he was a baby and he made babies so that's Jesus Christ never did both of those so that made him did he Christ was did he ma'am because he came here he came here with us in him we didn't come here with him in us and man that all right okay all right so now we come to Jesus Christ there is King theophany and I love like I said before except the atom for a minute Adam was the god of the earth I had him had complete rulership but he was not the God he was not this Great King theophany he was part of that theophany you and I are part of that t oppan e we're tied back to the eternal the property God said amen but Adam lost it or forfeited the right to bring all this to pass he forfeited he gave the book back to God which was what book of names it was the book of life eternal section okay alright cuz it look this right here is the eternal section of that book God himself there's a book that's got life in it that God said if you put to see if you put a seed in the spurt or a sperm of the egg together it makes a baby I'm going to give it life so he says bring forth life okay that's what's that whoop we're not gonna get to it because I'm gonna stop in a few minutes we'll get to it next Sunday because I haven't even read one of the fifth in quotes yet but it's not alright do we need that we need them to back up what I just said okay you don't need them if you listen to what I'm saying run it through your filter a man run it through your filter and don't get your own idea or your own slant just listen to what's being said don't worry about what that see often is that the opening to me is a body made by the Word of God it cannot be touched by human hands it cannot be made by human hands it has to come from right here tell you some people when we find out that we come straight from God now remember we're going to see something we'll read it next Sunday we didn't come straight from God in the theophany we came down here in flesh we came down here lost we came down here with a nature attached to our soul I'll read it next Sunday brother brems tells us it was all smutty blackened marg God can't touch an unclean vessel right maybe he can't dwell an unclean vessel but he can't clean that vessel up because I'm gonna read you with the Liddell's talking long time ago about Holy Ghost and fire there's your burner it burns that nature off of you and kills it it don't kill your soul it just kills the nature what that you drop smoke run around you know here we go with list again the number one thing you make a list but when I was out in the world doing the things of the world I wasn't here so there's my list one left I wasn't a believer and man I wasn't under what I wasn't under the leadership of the Holy Spirit I was under the leadership of a spirit all right but it wasn't holy a man's all right so this King theophany now comes down here in human flesh now he has a body that came from God and it started as a baby that all right came as a baby just like me and you because the kids went had to be kin to me in you I know this is elementary but it's got you got to bring it into the story that the entire Godhead dwelled in that baby and he came here with King theophany already in place amen I love that why you can't fail with that what if we're to come that way but we could because we spawn on this he was born on this end that's why it's called fall we fell we fell from what coming this way to where we had to come see if God didn't I didn't have a crisis meeting in heaven God didn't have to worry about anything he said okay Satan that's all right you have just revealed more of me you have just made me more you've expanded me more than would've it's we to come this way around here you played right into my plan you played right into my hands and you might think that you stopped the son and daughter of God being born the way they're supposed to be but I'm going to use that thing that you used the sex and I'm going to bring my children here anyway in continuance where I was I fashion right right the only problem is we had to come through death we had to come through the death part all right we had to come to the death part but we had a redeemer and what did he do remember remember and I'll bring it next Sunday and adoption brother Brown said Jesus Christ did not come to bring you an inheritance well that's boy when you preach that in different places they like who you reach what the prophecy and the Dobson series brother Brown said Jesus Christ did not come to bring you an inheritance what did Adam lose Adam didn't lose his inheritance he had eternal life he just lost the way remember he was pushed out of the garden and the Flaming Gorge what guarded the way back in well then Christ became the way to what bring us right back bring us right back he made the way for us to get back because look he didn't come down here and say well I'm going down I'm going to I'm bringing you something new that ain't knew he was back here he knew what he was doing he knew he was breaking the seal open that had been sealed up from right here all the way to here that seal was broke in Jesus Christ remember he is the seal hey man so what did he break he broke the seal so that you and I can get right back to this spot right here amen then on the day of Pentecost that's what happened that King theophany started spreading himself out just exactly the way it was going to happen in the Garden of Eden but there was a fall we had to contend with but still that's exactly the way that it would be a man let's try to read one or two and this is just going to reiterate what I said but let's read them anyway number one entombment 1957 okay let's just read the the read the entire Godhead was in him he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost but dwelt in a human form the theophany of gloves a great image of God that he made man in then placed him in the earth he had a body God isn't without a body listen God has never been without a body God has a body it's like God is not it's like Rodell see God is not he doesn't have a soul this whole being is the soul of God he doesn't see we st. we look at that we go why remember we were separated we were separated we fell that never failed so when we get back listen to me now when we get back to the future' home I'm just going to say that because that's the very end because we do in the Millennium actually we do here we go back to the original right here right before we go home we go but let's just put it on into the look on end of the moment let's say the Millennium when we get into Millennium that's exactly what would walk the earth body spirit and soul eternal that's what a body changes people that's why people are just going to be hard to make a body change can be hard but somebody is going to do it because of one little scripture we which are alive and remain listen if Jesus resurrected on one Scripture we're going to take a body change on one Scripture and it's just a piece of Scripture amen all right so God's got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it others saw it and it looks like a man and let's now watch and it's just an impression this is of what that is and everything on earth the beauty the sweetness the beauty of the earth is nothing in the world but an answer to a far better than that that weights us when we leave this world for everything in earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven everything that's good everything this righteous never clean this beautiful trees birds everything is just a pattern of what's in heaven our own life is just a pattern it's just a shadow remember we got to realize one thing when God the probably God said that God took a picture of us at our prime of life 18 to 20 years old before the foundation of the world he didn't wait till you got down here and got 18 to 20 years old right there is your picture when he said Genesis 1:26 when he said let us make man in our own image the real guy is all I wasn't back there no you weren't back there you were nothing but right there in the mind of God yes you where you were is real more real than you are right now didn't get many men's on that one but we were listen we kind of know we came from somewhere right I know for a fact I didn't come here with eternal life but now that I have eternal life I know where it came from I know where it came from our old life was just a pattern it's just a shadow and not the real thing so that eighteen to twenty years old like I said he didn't wait to take that picture down here he preserved that thing way back over here put that thing in an album and said I have so much patience I'm going to wait six thousand years ten thousand years eighty-five million years but it's gonna come to pass because you know what's eighty-five million years to eternal person our own life is just a pattern it's just a shadow not the real thing it's the negative side see we take all we're piloting this is the positive edges no it's totally the negative of what God saw oh right there because remember this is not supposed to come like it did this is not the perfect will of God this is a permissive will of God and man the perfect will of God is his word the permissive wheels all this other stuff down here and then we spoke on that many times it takes death to develop the picture to put us back in the theophany we came from then in the resurrection we come in his likeness a resurrect no up you shall we go all look like Jesus well they don't even that's not even what he looks like now he's 20 years old now he's not 33 or whatever that is he's not that but that's the picture of him when he wasn't here on earth that's what I said before listen listen when you got born again you got a body change that's the oppening body that burnt that old nature off you become an 18 year old person you had to because I want to read you if I get to it I'm going to read you where brother Brown said when he went to hell he saw young and old he didn't say that in a six dimension right he said they were all young he said but when I went to hell I saw him young I saw old people why listen the benefit of us being at Genesis 1:26 man is that we are young and then what we're going to if you don't if you leave that nature at old nature attached to that soul God give you God can't say that he can't go over that any more he winks in our ignorance at one time but now we know how to take that came right then in the resurrection when we come in his likeness a resurrected body what a beautiful not only beautiful but it's the real solemn truth of God's eternal word that will be like him why was going to be like him because like like bow still said that poor old man that said that this morning they said that yesterday he's 85 years old he's about blind so he thought I was daddy and dated with me I met he you can't I get out a lot of things you know it mister Charlie's a good guy he's really nice to us so I'm not grading him a bit he's a really nice guy but he can't see worth the flip and I'll tell him the next time I say but look this man right here doesn't get old and and and young and old and young that's God who wants a God with a gray beard and walks like this no I want a young God that skips the Bible says to skip like a lamb and do all these wonderful things that's the kind of God I want I want a guard with some youth to it I'm getting old Rolaids getting old here though yeah you're right about that all right look let's read this right here and then we'll stop we'll get this next Sunday that's only half of what I had so go yeah that's good entomb yeah number two let's read this one here he goes where did he leave when he left now I want to talk to you about just for a minute and then we're going to stop this is the quarter one read here he goes where did he leave when he left the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah his soul his spirit his theophany of his own being went down so now look that's the complete package he left his earthly body up in the tomb see see brothers and sisters that's our sacrifice the theophany didn't bleed the theophany never died the body died just like those sacrifices back in this back in the Old Testament the body died so his body died is our sacrifice but he gave his soul ransom his soul went to hell and if that is the oppening and if that's just the opening it's the same you and I went with him right but Larry we don't have to go to hell him or we already been we've lifted on you laughs but I see that as something personal I don't have to go to hell because I went to hell already with him and I was so protected I wasn't scared God didn't go down to then awesome Gaga goat I was able to lay I got told all these people and he's shaking like no same way when I told him this morning about laughs about Legion Jesus didn't step this foot off that boat and go there's a bunch of Devils on that island hunting come he's thinking think about it he just stepped on out and they went to screaming he didn't hey man that's what we're coming to folks I'm telling you because that thing that's scaring us we got to get rid of we got to get rid of that thing that scared us that repented not the long suffering the days of Noah his soul his spirit his theophany of his own being went down now let's follow him but roll it back up I keep going yeah we okay now look he tells us just below the reasons a mortal being lays the realm of demon power below that just above that lace the souls are then just so below it lays the very domain of Satan he'll then just above us lays the Holy Spirit then under the altar lays the souls of the just men the next is God himself that's up in the seventh dimension one going downward one going upward the two spirits are here on earth influencing the people of this earth now keep going now look this is where I want to show you something when Jesus died he goes up down there I can see him on that Friday afternoon after his death by the RAM knock knocks on the door of the regions of the Lost let's follow him a minute the door opens there was women there was men there were young ladies there were old they weren't all in his prime of their youth the way they died but what brother Brown say I think after this and offices whichever way the tree leans that's where false they were old there were all together in that hideous place called the prison of the lost soul man so we don't want things for sure he didn't see that in the six dimension he saw everybody young everybody happy everybody rejoicing he saw everybody in what in their prime he didn't say that about these people why because they didn't accept the sacrifice amen now hey can y'all switch to one more and then I'll quit right hand will go back to read this let me find it real quick go to number nine and then I'll prove all this other stuff later about the nature because I got it all right here you know me I don't come up here with with nothing all right come on come up come on here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany this is from questions and answers on Hebrews 1957 he was in its theophany again okay his soul was down there with those people that were in the opening also dinner has a theophany you sawing off the often is God be careful be careful there's to life a permitted life and then they'd eternal life man all right now what we'll explain later also and was witnessing to them that they repented not in the long-suffering now if you take that and you see that what God did we'll put this back together and then we'll start next Sunday what God did is God gave us a choice when we got here we're all because we do have a soul and I don't want I don't like going that's not a soul a soul it's me right like I said before Seoul is not some little spot I got in my heart no it's me you see me moving my souls moving you see me talking my soul is doing the talking right because my brain can't talk thank god it's coming from something way down inside hey man that's why I love what brother Brown said he said you can't love with your soul now listen you have to run that through your filter because you can't feel your love with your soul you natural love with your with your with everything else on the outside that soul inside of you is agape love that's the only true love of God that is the theophany a man that is the theophany that is pure and descend the theophany that is eternal life but you cannot love listen when Adam and eat when Eve did what she did in the garden I think about this ladies and gentlemen wake up from it you men let's just be honest if my wife laid with a beast I'd divorce her wouldn't you hello come on now naturally speaking filial love would you want her back if she laid with the Beast No so what took over with Adam what took over with Adam it was not filial love it was that right there it was a Goffe love that love way down inside that God gave Adam eternal life and not a godly love because what did brother Brett think that was a type of who Christ I think Christ would be a godly love wouldn't you that agape love came forth and said I'll take her I'll keep her she's mine keep part of me God I can't kill her I want killer because he's me Jesus Christ go to the cross yes I don't have to but ever got me love I will go to the cross and whether they love me or not I'm still going to die for he died for the whole world didn't he but he
