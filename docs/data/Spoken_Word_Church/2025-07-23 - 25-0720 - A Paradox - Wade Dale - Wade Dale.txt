The walls of Jer and golden street. Why should I be present? Why should I enter in after all the sinful living and the wicked one I'm in the presence of Jehovah as I stand before the throne the accuser of the bre starts to ring the things I've done. As I hear the awful charges, a question f my mind. Why should not be placed in hell to suffer for our time is true love. That's all I have to be is through the love that Jesus shed for me. Not by works of my own rightousness. Oh filthy rags are they loving a battle rug tree hanging on this is my only fruit of a valley and I see there's no way Now the winds of sorrow threaten me and turn my world around. That's when I look to Jesus and the price he paid for me. I can lift my hands in praise to him and shout the victory. is true love. That's all I have to love. Love that Jesus shed for me. of my works. So my own rightousness or fil. But because of that tree hanging on the calary. This is my only is through the blood.

This morning, we're going to sing the song, Where could I go but to the Lord in the key of G. Amen. Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford striving alone to face temptation. Lord, where could I go? Back to the Lord. Where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking a reuge for my soul. needing a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? [Music] And life here is grand with friends I love so dear. comfort I get from God's own word. Yet when I face the chilling hand of death, where could I go back to the Lord? Where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to help me in the end.

Sister Linda, the boys aren't here today. I got a little buddy named Josiah, and he sang he sang my song. He learned to sing my song. And so, we're going we're going to sing it this morning. But uh I was going I was going to ask him to come sing this morning with me, but he's not here. But uh everybody everybody knows everybody knows the song. And before brother Wade comes this morning, we're going to sing Paul and Silas. Everybody everybody knows the song. And we're going to worship the Lord for a few minutes. And just clap your hands, raise your hands, whatever you feel like doing this morning. Worship the Lord as we sing. Well, you've heard the story of Paul and Silas, how they were bound and thrown into jail. They kept on praying. They didn't worry. They were serving a God that could not fail. Well, on about midnight, God sent an earthquake where the whole foundation began to shake. Those prison doors blew open wide and Paul and Silas stepped outside. Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of need like those Hebrew children from that fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two fishes and bread and he walked on the water and he raised the dead. Well, he stood by Daniel in the lion's hand. He saved over Moses from Pharaoh's men. Open the eyes of the blind to see. I know that he'll deliver me. Now it was David, my God delivered. When before Goliath made it stand, he took no armor. He took no weapons, just five stones and a sling in his hand as he went running to meet that army. He met that Philistine man that stood mighty and tall. He said, "I come in the name of the Lord." And oh, that mighty man did fall. Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of me like those Hebrew children from that fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two fishes and bread and he walked on the water and he raised the dead when he stood by Daniel in the lion's d. He saved old Moses from Pharaoh's men. Open the eyes of the blind to see. I know that he'll deliver me. Now it was David. My God delivered. When before Goliath he did stand, he took no armor. He took no weapons, just five stones and a sling in his hand. As he went running to meet that army, he met that Philistine man that stood mighty and call. He said, "I come in the name of the Lord." And oh, that mighty man did fall. Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of need like those he grew children from that fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two fishes and bread and he walked on the water and he raised the dead. When he stood by Daniel in the lion's den, he saved old Moses from Pharaoh's men. Open the eyes of the blind to see. I know that he'll deliver me. As brother comes this morning, he'll deliver me in my time of need. children [Music] 5,000 with his fishes and bread. And he walked on the water and he raised the dead while he stood by Daniel and lions. He saved all Moses from Pharaoh's men. Same God. Same God here today. I to see. Sing it one more time. Oh, turn around, shake somebody's hand, and say, "God bless you. Good to see you today." Oh, he'll deliver me in my time of need. From that fire he breathed, fed 5,000 with his fishes and bread, walk on the water, and he raised the dead. Well, he stood by Daniel in that lion's den. Pharaoh's men open the eyes of the blind to see. I know that he'll deliver me. You believe that? Same God, same one, same Holy Ghost inside of you did every bit of that. Amen. We believe it was the same person, right? We don't believe it was two or three different people. It was the same God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That delivered them. We'll deliver you today. Well, good to be in the house of the Lord. Good to be back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always a pleasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I want to thank all the church here in in Irwin for for putting up with us for a few for a few days. And uh and uh that's right. Okay. I wanted them to say okay. But um we sure have enjoyed it. Brother uh Andre and I were talking we should have done this a long time ago, but since we didn't, we're going to catch up. So, we're just going to keep doing it as long as the Lord allow us to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh we appreciate all of ours that came uh made the journey with us. And also uh Brother Luke, Sister Jan coming and being with us. And &gt;&gt; we've had a wonderful time. Yesterday was a wonderful day for us to get together and fellowship and uh and eat and then eat and then eat some more. So today we're going to try to eat a little bit of spiritual food. &gt;&gt; So if you got your Bibles, let's go right straight into the word of God. It's going to be kind of a a paradox today. We're going to u uh go to 1 Corinthians 6 verse 9. And we greet you again in the name of the Lord from Spoken Word Church there in Lulu. They're live streaming in now and and uh not having service, but again, we appreciate Brother Andre opening up his church for us and uh to speak and I was talking to uh brother Jackie and and uh brother Albert, I wondering how long we've been, how long this place had been here. We started coming I think in 1974 and we were all a lot younger than we are now but um a lot of waters went under the bridge. We've had a lot of trials, troubles, tribulations, went out in the world for a little while. Lord brought us back. Now we've come back full circle to a place that we really enjoyed being here &gt;&gt; during that time that we were uh coming up here uh rather often uh back then in the in the 70s. So we sure appreciate this place. I believe God set it aside for a reason because there's a bride here. &gt;&gt; God's going to take care of his own kids. God's going to take care of his bride. &gt;&gt; Satan's not going to take care of them. I promise you that. &gt;&gt; God's going to take care of his own children. And today I want to speak to you today a little bit and show you that we are looking at a paradox. Let me tell you before we get started. We're going to look at the Apostle John today. Now this not John the Baptist. All right? This is the Apostle John. Not John the Baptist. So when I say John, I mean who? &gt;&gt; The re &gt;&gt; the revelator. John the revelator. The one who went to Patmas. Okay. One more time. John the &gt;&gt; revelator. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. But we're going to get started here first and then we'll move our way there and then uh let's see what the Lord has for us. So let's bow our heads before we get started. I know we all have needs to uplift our hands. We have sick among us. We have our um friends and family that are not serving the Lord. We all have those needs. So if you'll raise your hand before the Lord, we'll say a prayer and get started. Father, Lord, with our hands up, Lord, mine, too. I pray, Lord, that that all the needs will be met in this building today. that Father, you will continue to bless us, lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit. Lord, bless the local congregation here and brother Andre, Lord, keep him strong, Lord, and and bless his wife, Father, as she recovers, Lord. May may there be no nothing backwards. Everything will be forward from now on and the healing process will continue. Father, I pray for the ones that are weward, Lord. We know we all have one in our heart that we're thinking about that's not here today or or has backslid or has went away from the Lord or doesn't know you. Father, I pray that you would stir the water, Father, and and draw them to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Be with us today, Lord, as we speak your word, you do the speaking, Lord. May we hear from you and no one else. Father, I pray that you'd be with the ones that are in the foreign mission fields, Lord, a different one. Brother Aaron getting ready to leave in a few month going there to Honduras and different places. I pray that you'd be with him, Lord. Bless the ones, Lord, that are on the highways. We're going to have to all travel back home, most of us. So, be with us, Lord, as we travel back. Give us safe journey. And Lord, may we go away from this place, Lord, knowing that that we met you today. Not just human beings, but we met you through human beings today, Lord. And that this will all be done for your honor and glory. In Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, you have to pinch yourself for a minute because we got to get started, but we got we're going to end somewhere. All right. So, I'm we're going to talk about this whole congregation here for just a second. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; All right. No tomatoes. 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? That's &gt;&gt; right. Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors. Now, this is Paul speaking to his church in Corinthians, okay? He's not out on the street preaching. He's preaching to his people. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to make you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weak. That was weak. &gt;&gt; I heard y'all shouting yesterday about certain things and ball games and all that stuff. So, let's shout for the Lord today. Neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves of mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists shall inherit the kingdom of God. We're in trouble. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Paul says that's out in the barrooms and it's not affecting us today. Verse 11, he said, "And such were some of &gt;&gt; you, but you are washed, but you are sanctified. You are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God." Now, let's turn to Romans 8. Romans 8:1. Now, you heard what I said, what we were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But by the saving grace of Jesus Christ, this is what we are now. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1. You got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I you it's usually on the screen. That's why I'm I'm going to wait till you turn you to the to the scripture. Romans 8:1 Paul says, "There's therefore now what? &gt;&gt; No condemnation." &gt;&gt; I thought we just all felt condemned about two minutes ago, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Such were some of you. Well, now such are some of you now. There is therefore now no condemnation to them what? which are in Christ Jesus, who walked not after the flesh, but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, and that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. &gt;&gt; What? that the righteousness of the law, the law was righteous under Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The law condemned us. But when Christ came, he lived the law and gave us liberty to see the righteousness of the law. We're the only ones that can live the Ten Commandments. We're the only one that can live the Bible the way it's supposed to be lived. Is that not right? &gt;&gt; Am I in the right place? &gt;&gt; We still believe Brother Brandon was a prophet, right? We believe what he said about us. We're going to talk about that in just a little bit. All right. So, remember though the contrast 1 Corinthians and then Romans 8:1 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled what? &gt;&gt; In us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Us today. Us. No one outside today. Us. &gt;&gt; That about me fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. You may be seating as blessing to the reading of the word. But in Corinthians, Paul's giving us a a summation of what our life was before Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he's given us a summation in Romans 8 of our life being filled with Christ. All right? And we see that there was a law and we see that there was grace. But remember, there was grace in the law. If you killed somebody, you could go into a sanctuary city and you stay in that sanctuary city. Right? So there was actually grace in the law. But remember, if we stay under the law, the law kills us. So what did we have? We had to come to a place to where someone had to change this contrast of being these horrible people to there is therefore now no condemnation. And it's the same people, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. You're the same person that you were well maybe not 25 years ago. Maybe a little different, but you're still you. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Hebrews 9 because I want us to see something today that that we're going to get to the Apostle John and and see something. I believe it'll help you a little bit to uh to understand why we we do have trials and tribulations. We have strife. We have trouble. Uh, when you got saved and you got born again, Sister Kim, your bills didn't quit coming in the mail, right? Your car never broke down. &gt;&gt; Your house never needed a repair, right? &gt;&gt; No, that ain't right in my Georgia language. No, that ain't right. Seems like you have more trouble. But listen, you'll know how to handle it better if you're a born again Christian. Instead of blaming other people, we just go ahead and blame oursel and we just go and move on with it. But look at Hebrews 9 real quick and then we'll get set a basis here and then we'll get started. So Hebrews 9:15. For this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament. What was the first testament? The law. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You got hold your Bible up. It says old &gt;&gt; testament. &gt;&gt; And you look in Matthew, it says New Testament. All right. Hebrews 9:15, for the transgression that was under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. Now, those people in first Corinthians didn't receive a promise of eternal inheritance while they were named as they were named as horongers and revilers and liars and all those different things. &gt;&gt; But receiving this testament, this New Testament, as you take communion, I know y'all take communion once a month like we do. Jesus said, "This is the new testament in my blood. This is the something new." But something had to happen for us to transition from from being this lost condition to being where even in John in Revelations 5, not being lost in his soul, but he was he was he was afraid that that he wasn't going to make it. He cried, and we'll read that in just a few minutes to where we go over to to the book of Revelations where he's shouting and praising God because of the things he sees. &gt;&gt; Right? Right. &gt;&gt; So, what are you trying to say, brother Wayade? We're going to have trials. We're going to have tribulation. We're going to have trouble. We're all going to have We're all We all had to come out of the world. And then the world had to come out of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. But when it did, it changed us by a new testament according to Hebrews 9:16. For where a testament is, there must also ne necessity be a death. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Um, my u wife's mother died seven years ago and we didn't read her will till she died. &gt;&gt; You don't read wills until people pass away. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. You read a will after the person's dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it's not enforced when it's alive. Usually the usually the the will says after my after my departure u Gail gets everything I got you know or whoever your wife is they get or the husband they get everything you got well that's what's happening same Jesus come the same way for watch verse 17 for a testament is of force after men are dead so Jesus when he raised that cup on the communion night right before he was crucified he said this is the new testament in my blood and what that new testament was going to do was it was going to wipe the sin off of your life. When you get born again, your sin is gone. &gt;&gt; I want us to see that &gt;&gt; your sin in your soul is gone. You are a new creature. &gt;&gt; You have become a new testament because you had to die too. &gt;&gt; You had to die to have a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? That's right. &gt;&gt; So now continue verse 17. For a testament is a force after men are dead. Otherwise it is has it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. In other words, the person or the one that's giving the testament or giving a uh the really the testator means someone that's giving something away or giving something. All right. Verse 18. whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept of to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool hip sprinkled it all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto me. And as we continue on we know what happened that the next day after Jesus said this is the new testament man my blood. What did he do? He died. He passed away. He's body died, but his soul didn't die. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that because we don't die. &gt;&gt; Christians just fall asleep. Just departs from this world because we came here born in sin and and ch and we got to wait for a body change and we haven't got to it yet. So, as we pass away, the body stays here. The uh soul goes in another dimension and it's waiting. Thank God for a prophet that told us all this and literally went there to tell us these things so that we can come back and have assurityity. I can have assurityity that this is my testament &gt;&gt; that God gave us. &gt;&gt; He gave it to me. He didn't give it to nobody else. He gave it to me. He didn't give it to you. He didn't die for you. He died for me. &gt;&gt; All right. You got to figure out whether he died for you or not. Right? &gt;&gt; But if he did die for you, then there's something that we're going to look at that has been a mystery since the foundation of the world. And it's been in the minds and the hearts of others all down through the ages. But here today, we stand and we're looking, if you're looking down at your Bible, you're looking at your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, after somebody dies, that's the first thing they do. They probate it for 30 days and then they go to the court, they give it and they say if anybody's got anything against anything against you, then they can't read that will until that's taken care of. But today, when you get when you're born again of the spirit of God, there's nothing against you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can come and you don't have to wait 30 days for man to stand and read the will and say, "Okay, you get this and you get that and you know I I I bestow this on you and this on you." No. God gave us a will right here. 66 p 66 chapters. &gt;&gt; This is the will. Every every Sunday we have a death. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is Sunday? Resurrection morning. &gt;&gt; We come to what? show that someone had died and now they've resurrected. I want to ask you a question today. Have you died and resurrected yet? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about even Christians. Have you died today &gt;&gt; of the things that you were living for yesterday and got rid of them? Because this will, if you don't understand what this will is, you'll be confused. Because this will today, as I'm looking at it today, right here, this is your adoption paper. This is your will. This shows that you're in the family. It shows you what you got. Ain't that what a will does? A will shows you what you are what you're given from the testator or from the person that's passed on. All right. So God gave us this will which brother Brown said his will is his what? Is his word. &gt;&gt; All right. So if his will is his word, this is where we must look at first to see what we have as a member of the bride of Jesus Christ. But remember, this Bible or this will is being read today down the street and over across the the river over there by Presbyterians, by Methodists, by Baptist. &gt;&gt; They're reading the same thing. &gt;&gt; But they're not getting the mystery of the will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because they look at it um &gt;&gt; and they look at it and go, "Well, there's three." &gt;&gt; They go to Matthew 28:19 and say, "Well, we need to baptize in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." They look in the Bible and somewhere they find a trinity. &gt;&gt; It's not in there, but they they find it. So what do we today as the bride? We're standing here today, sitting here today. There's a mystery that must be unfolded just to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not to the world. It is just to the bride. I mean, this is the greatest book that was ever written. There's there's more there's more Bibles in print. It's the greatest book that ever was, you know, New York Times bestseller. Ain't got nothing to do with this guy. What do we see the mystery of what this will has given us? &gt;&gt; Because God hid it &gt;&gt; in the will. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I do because there wouldn't be so much confusion. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be so much I believe in this and I believe in that. I believe it's all right if we do this. And you know, you've got what 13,000 now different denominations. I was listening to brother Brown the other day. He said 969. Well, I looked up, Sister Dorothy. I looked up on I I Googled it, so it's got to be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to be true. There's 13,000 different denominations now in the world. From 969 that we quote from Brother Brandham to today, there's 13,000 different ways they interpret this. Well, &gt;&gt; 13,000 different times. Now, God's not that confused. He wants a group of people to know exactly what he wants to give them, who to give it to, and for us how to use it, what God's given us. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; But we can't look at every We look at Corinthians and we go, "Man, these people are lost." And then Paul says, "Such were some of you." So, you got to figure out there's got to be a way or something's got to be a way to get us to Romans 8:1. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? This is simple, but we're getting to something here. &gt;&gt; All right. Romans 8:1 got us somewhere. And it had to be that testator dying. And for us to not read the Irwin Times, I don't know what Irwin paper they're about to do away with paper now, you know? I mean, it's all on it's all on the internet, so it's all got to be true. But hey, you got all these other things that you read and and sure we read self-help books and we read about different things and we do look up things online and and used to go to the library and you don't have to go to the library anymore. You just open up your phone almost and get any answer that you want. But is it the real answer? &gt;&gt; Is it the true answer? &gt;&gt; Is it man's idea or is it God? as as our brother was saying yesterday and I really really appreciate when I I I hold on to that quote probably more than anything else where brother Ram said, "Let's go back in the back part of God's mind." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take a stroll to where no one else has been &gt;&gt; and it's in the back part of God's mind. &gt;&gt; And bring it out. Now listen, I believe Brother Brandham went there, but I don't believe the door was shut where you can't go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; When he went back into the back part of God's mind, I believe he Isn't he supposed to tie up all the loose ends? Wasn't Wasn't this Malachi 4 person supposed to open the seals and open the door and open open? Well, guess what he did when he went there? He brought that part of God's mind, the eternal part, and he brought it to us. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is it. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed." And then what is the great mystery in the Bible? It tells us plainly in Colossians, he says, "What is it? What is this great mystery? It's Christ in you, the hope of glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. If it Christ is not in us today, there is no hope &gt;&gt; of a resurrection or rapture. But there's going to be one, folks. I'll promise you. You can sit here today and you can close your eyes and you can say, "I don't believe what's going on. I don't believe this Christianity stuff. I don't believe this." Well, you are an unbeliever. That's why &gt;&gt; this will requires believing something. We had to believe Jesus Christ died. Were you there? Some of you are pretty old, but you're not that old. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. We don't have any documentation except believing word of mouth. There was no pictures, no photographs. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So that's why we become believers. And as we become believers, we do see the back part of God's mind. We do see because I believe that's where he wrote the Bible from. &gt;&gt; He wrote it from that part that no one else can understand. But he had to write it for everybody because he's not a respector of persons. He had to write it for every person on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Even the devil, &gt;&gt; but the devil don't believe it. &gt;&gt; And people don't believe in this whatever, you know, you this religion thing and all this. I told the church the other day, I said, "It's just so hard now though, that um that Christianity has just become this big broad brush and you just take and brush it across the wall." And that's Christianity. You can you can have tattoos. You can have rings. You got earrings and all the you and you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to church. You just have to believe that God's God and and then go about your business. Well, no. There is something in this will that tells me that's not right. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said faith final resting place is not in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God &gt;&gt; which is the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. We're not doing away with that, which is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; We would not understand this will had it not been for the message of the hour. I know a lot of you come out of denominations. Some came out of just come from the world. So, you were a denomination of your own self. &gt;&gt; But everybody came from somewhere with an idea. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Everybody came somewhere with an idea. You didn't come here to sit here today and your mind was blank. No. Your mind's running all the time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But why can't we see the back part of God's mind? It's a mystery that was withholden until we had a prophet come to help us see that this was the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And it was the correct way to do the correct way to live, the correct way to worship. That's right. We may have flaws. We may have problems. But I'll promise you one thing. You try your heart out to live this message as the prophet preached it according to the word of God. And that's the closest anybody on this earth is going to be to God is you living it the way you're supposed to live it according to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's just it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What are you going to put your hope in? You tell me what you going to put your hope in. finances, you just wait another year, maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just wait. There's going to be a crash like you never seen before. You know, when stock markets crash, the two years before they have their best years. &gt;&gt; I can remember when the stock market was like 9,000, it's 30 something thousand or 13,000. It's just astronomical. &gt;&gt; If you put your hope in that, guess what you're doing? You're throwing money in that thing and it keeps piling up. Well, all of a sudden one day that's going to get pulled out from under you and you're going to go back to zero. They I work for the post office and they have a uh a retirement plan, a 401k or something that's matching. But you can instantly look on your phone every day and find out how much you made or how much you lost. &gt;&gt; Well, boy, when the stock market went down the other day, all of them were looking on their phones. They're like, "We lost $25,000." I said, "No, you didn't have it to begin with." &gt;&gt; That's right. You just had a small portion of that. You didn't lose $25,000. You didn't have it to begin with. &gt;&gt; It's just all on paper. Sam Walton said one time, he said, "It's just all on paper." &gt;&gt; We don't even have cash in our pocket anymore. &gt;&gt; We didn't have paper. &gt;&gt; We got to build our hope on something besides that. &gt;&gt; Something besides that. I like what one of the brothers at church said that brother Brown told us that this nation was gone. &gt;&gt; So we don't we don't need to get happy about the good things that are happening in this nation. We know what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day this nation's going to get it &gt;&gt; because they turned down this right here &gt;&gt; in English. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They turned down God's prophet spoke English. brought it to the United States of America and turned it down. More denominations now than ever. You'd think if he'd come and and the way he tore those denominations down that that that they would be no more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, there was plenty more. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people. You and I are the only people, as I said before, that are going to see this event. Let's go to Matthew 16. Brother Andre, I can't see that far back, brother. Hey, there you go. Okay, he's sitting back there in the men's bathroom almost. Just don't let nobody go out the door. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Matthew 16:28. We'll build up to something here. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, you've got you have got to make a decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't walk this life wishy-washy. You've got to make a decision. &gt;&gt; And I'll promise you everything as the as the manifestation of the word comes forth, &gt;&gt; you're going to manifest who you are also. &gt;&gt; Hide it all you want to. Hide it any way you want to. When this word comes forth, there'll be a time when even the Bible says the sinner will not be able to sit in this congregation. Why? Their sins will be called out. &gt;&gt; All right. Wow. Matthew 16 verse 28. Now, as we know, I know brother Andre is very versed in and I know he teaches y'all well, so I don't have to background about the dispensations of the son of man and son of God, son of David. Do I have to do that? No. Jesus came as the son of man. &gt;&gt; The son of man is what? God in a human vessel. Right. &gt;&gt; That was that was born without sex. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was God in human flesh. All right. When he when he ascended, he came back in a spirit form called the Holy Ghost. That was the son of God. &gt;&gt; The dispensation through the church ages was son of God. That's the Holy Ghost inside the believer. Everybody with me? Then it's promised in the book of Psalms, I believe it is, or over in the Old Testament, that that the son of David would sit on the throne ruling and and reigning the 12 tribes of Israel. So that's the son of David, which is we know it's Jesus Christ. But brother Brown told us right in in between the time of the son of God and the son of David dispensation, there's a small period of time that the son of man will come back into power. &gt;&gt; That's what we're living under today. You're living under a ministry that's not the son of God ministry. It's the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Your flesh and my flesh are going to be literally changed by the word of God that you listen to. &gt;&gt; Literally going to be changed. It's going to change us back. You say, "I don't see that." I see it. &gt;&gt; Even though we get older, even though we look different because we get What are you looking at? I'm not looking at this. We're looking at that thing inside of us because remember that thing inside of us is greater than we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This Linda, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; That real you never sinned a time. &gt;&gt; All the things we went through of all of our life that we can remember up here. If you're born again by the spirit of God, that eternal life is in your soul. You can't sin anymore. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can't fall ever again. It's eternal. It's perfect. It's the thing we were singing about. It'll deliver you from the things that you need to be delivered from. &gt;&gt; Matthew 16:28 says, "Verily, I say unto you, there will be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the what? &gt;&gt; Son of man." Son of man, not son of God. Son of man coming in his kingdom. Now, what kingdom is the kingdom of the son of man? Remember Jesus said, "I have no kingdom here. My kingdom is not of this earth." Right? When he was here the first time, the son of man, the son of God kingdom was the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the seven church ages that are that are most are gone now. Everything's about over with. We're right at the end of the seven church age. Everybody with me? All right. Don't fall asleep on me. I'll come down there and sit with you with an ink pen. the son. Then you got the son of God dispensation which is not to us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's to the Jews. We're going to be there, but you know what we're going to do? We're going to be sitting right beside of him &gt;&gt; as the queen and him being the king. We're going to be the queen. Now, we got to get from here to here somewhere. Something's got to happen between this and this. &gt;&gt; Right. I believe a lot of people believe I do believe a lot of people believe that just God is sitting up there in heaven and he's got an X on a day on a calendar that he's coming. &gt;&gt; Sure, he knows when he's coming, but he's not coming till we get ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not coming. What are you saying, brother Way? Well, I think that's what the world's waiting for. The world's waiting on for a day that he's going to split the eastern skies. He's going to walk down through just like they did. Now listen. If the second coming of I just got this. If the second coming of Christ, first coming of Christ was they thought that G that this Messiah was going to come down go through Jerusalem and stick spears in the Romans and destroy their kingdom and get rid. Right. Is that what they said? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening now. They think that that Jesus is going to walk down through uh a big old cloud and walk down here and just, you know, take over every nation. That's not going to happen. I told the brother that one time. He was saying, he said, he said, "Oh, I can't wait that I can look up and see them eastern skies split and see Jesus walk down through there." And you know me. I said, "If you done that, you missed the rapture." &gt;&gt; He looked at me. I said, "The Bible tells me that it's a secret. It's a secret catching away. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be I said when you see him I said that's where every eye will behold him. I said that's the judge. He's coming down to judge. &gt;&gt; I don't want him to come down to judge. &gt;&gt; He's judging us now. &gt;&gt; So there's a son of man coming in his kingdom. So what is the kingdom of the son of man? He couldn't over here be the kingdom, have a kingdom because he was the only person that was the son of man. Everybody with me? When Jesus was on earth, there was no Christian. There was nobody saved. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You can say what you want to. Nobody got eternal life until Christ died, released that life &gt;&gt; for it to come back into the believers on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; All right? And that started the dispensation of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was standing in on here on earth and he said, "My warriors are not here or they would fight. My kingdom's not here." Where was his kingdom? &gt;&gt; His kingdom was inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His kingdom was waiting to get out. And on the day of Pentecost, 120 little kingdoms came forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says there will be somebody people standing here. There'll be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. What is the kingdom of the son of man? You're looking at it. &gt;&gt; This is his kingdom. The kingdom of the son of man. &gt;&gt; We've been called out of denominations. We've been called out of different things. And we've been put into this kingdom of the son of man because there's got to be a time to where and we'll look at it with John and the two types with John because remember also John the revelator type the bride right &gt;&gt; everybody knows that type John the revelator one man typed the whole entire bride. Now that's what the prophet says. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So John typed the bride. John the revelator. So whatever he goes through and sees we are. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Whatever he goes through, because remember in Revelations 4:1, he's caught up. We'll read that in just a minute. He goes up in a rapture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's caught up to see what what is, what was, what was, what is, and is to come. All right, we'll get to that in just a minute because brother Brandon will tell you that John the Revelator saw it just as he lived it. So the spirit of John, the the Holy Ghost in John is projecting all the way down to where you're sitting today. &gt;&gt; If he lived through it, he didn't. We know he died in, you know, AD96 or somewhere in there. We we he's gone on. But there's a there's a group of people that's going to see that's not going to taste death according to Matthew 16 till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. When the son of man comes in his kingdom, death will be destroyed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Death will be destroyed in me and you. You got to believe that. You I'm getting older. That doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sight and time is man's worst enemy. Looking at something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been in this thing for my brother Brown's been gone how many years? 60 some odd years. He's been gone. And here we're still here. But you know why we're still here? Because we're not all a complete body yet. &gt;&gt; Right. But remember, there's got to be a group of people that's alive. &gt;&gt; Alive. &gt;&gt; Because remember, the resurrection was told to live people. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a group of people that is alive. To me, that's the kingdom of the son of man that we're living in and living through. But there's going to be a culmination to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very soon. Matthew 17 verse1 there there Matthew 17 verse1 this is Matthew 16:28 ends if you look at your Bible it ends and I believe the next chapter starts Matthew 171 is that right &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; okay so he's it's it's continuing his thought Matthew is so and after six days it's kind of funny after six After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and who? &gt;&gt; John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his raignment was white as a light. And behold, there appeared what? Moses and Elijah talking with him. Then after Peter said unto Jesus, "It's good for us to be here." Peter got a denominational idea. He wants to build three tabernacles. Well, the the the Lord shut him up. Said, "Behold, behold this my beloved son. Hear you him." And then there was nobody else seen but Jesus. &gt;&gt; All right. So now look, so remember one more time, John was a type. So John was there, right? John was there. Peter, James, and John. John was in that scene and saw Jesus being glorified. &gt;&gt; Saw Moses and Elijah. Right &gt;&gt; now, Brother Bam's going to tell us here in just a few minutes. I hope I brought this one. Yes, I did. where Moses is representing six church ages that slept because Moses died. &gt;&gt; And then Elijah, the messenger of the last day, his group, I'll read it to you right here. &gt;&gt; But remember in your back part of your mind, John was a type of the entire bride in the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; So what he went through is what we're going through. Right? &gt;&gt; He didn't go through it. He he went through it in a vision, &gt;&gt; but this is a reality. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, let me tell you something. In the past year, have you seen how much prophecy has been made known? We have a pope from the United States now, &gt;&gt; which has been extremely quiet for the past few months. If you'll notice that he's not asleep in the Vatican, I promise you, &gt;&gt; they're working on something. Then you got a man in the in the office now of the White House that's going to be Revelations 13. It's going to be the voice. What? That's going to give the power to the beast. &gt;&gt; You see the power the man's wielded already in the first six months he's been in office. &gt;&gt; Not getting into politics, but that is what's happening according to Revelation 13. We see that happening. According to all these, we see everything coming to pass. We're living it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living. It's not prophecy anymore. Once a prophecy is made known and fulfilled, it's not a prophecy anymore. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram saw California sinking. Now, when that day when California sinks, that prophecy is over. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So listen, Revelations chapter 4, Brother Brham said, "Look, paragraph 136. Jesus said, "Some of you standing here will not taste of death till you see the kingdom." Now, he said the kingdom of God. Now watch this. This is how the Lord worked on brother Brandham. And I hope he works on us ministers and all you too. He didn't say the right thing. Revelation chapter 4. I know I read this the other night. Some of y'all that um at church, he says until they until they see the kingdom of God coming in power, or see the son of man coming in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; He changed it because it was wrong. Brother Brandham was I'm not going to say that. Some people when you say brother Brandham was wrong, they get all upset about it, but he was a human. &gt;&gt; He was a human being just like me and you. But the Holy Ghost stopped him. &gt;&gt; How many times have you seen listen to a a message and and Brother Mar go uh uh uh you know what he's doing? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is changing his thought. That's just the way I believe it, folks. I'm telling you. I believe he was so inspired by God till God wasn't going to let him. Especially when the seals open, he wasn't going to let him speak error. &gt;&gt; It was going to be the exact word of the will. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, brother Ram did preach that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost. We've been through that before. But we've all had our ideas &gt;&gt; about how this thing is going to happen and how these prophecies are going to happen. But there is a way that they're going to happen and that's the only way they're going to happen. Because when John saw what was going on and when he wrote that in the book of Revelations, that's the eternal word of God. It can't be changed. Not going to change. Never will change. All right. Now listen. So he changed it. Says, "See the son of man coming in his kingdom." Rather see the son of man coming in his kingdom. A few days after that, he took Peter, James, and John and went up on a high mountain and there was transfigured before them. Now watch. There was a transformation on a mountain. There was a transformation of the son of man. All right. Moses and Elijah were there. Listen to what the prophet said. Now watch. Over in this place, he saw the coming or the rehearsal. right? &gt;&gt; Or the rehearsal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what was the first thing he saw? The first thing he saw in the coming was Moses represented the dead saints that would be resurrected. Elijah was standing there. He said, so he interjected. Elijah was standing there. Oh, I want you to notice next paragraph what will take place. There was Moses first. That's all these six ages that slept. Six church ages. All right. He didn't say seven. Six church ages. Not only that, but Elijah was there. The messenger of the last day with his group. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, don't let your mind go wild and say that was brother Brandham standing on the mountain with Jesus and and Elijah, I mean Moses. It was not. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Elijah. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was not there. Sorry. Anyway, not only that, but Elijah was there, the messenger of the last day with his group of the transfigured, the raptured, now in the future awaiting the coming. Now, what did he do? Because he said, "Some people will stand here." not will not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and they seen the rehearsal of it. All right, continue on. Same same thing. Now listen, this is where we're going to get into a transition part of John because remember John type the bride. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; John type the bride. &gt;&gt; But now remember John is going to be like Moses though and type the bride in the six church ages because they're gone on. All right, everybody with me? Cuz brother, I'm I'll read it. I already read it to you one time. Here we go. I'd like to bring you to another thing. Verse one, I mean chapter 141. After Jesus died and buried in St. John 21:20, that's actually St. John 21:22. If you want to turn there and read it, we'll read it here in just a second. Some critics started this in the early day, right? While we're in this lesson, let's clean it up. Jesus had met with his disciples, fed them fish and bread upon the fire. As they went upon the bank, John leaned upon his bosom. And Peter asked a question, said, "What will happen to this man?" Jesus loved John. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus loved his bride. Jesus loved John. Every time I see John, I see me. I see the bride. All right. &gt;&gt; Every time. &gt;&gt; What's going to be his estate? What's going to be his future? Now it's St. John 20 21 verse 22. Let's read it. And Jesus said unto them, "What is it to you if he tries until I come till I return?" What is it? That's this is brother Brown paraphrasing. What is it to you? Now watch John the person John did not see Jesus come back. He's in the grave right now. &gt;&gt; But remember, he is projected as the bride, &gt;&gt; right? And tight. Jesus said that he was going to live. Uh the disciples made a mistake and I'm reading from brother Brandham. They said Jesus said he was going to live till the coming of the Lord. But Jesus didn't make no mistake. Right here in Revelations the 4th chapter, Christ kept his word. He brought John up into heaven and rehearsed the whole thing to him. Now who'd he bring up? He brought the bride. Now listen, you and I are not in a rapture right now, but we are in rapturing condition. As brother uh Joel said last night, the rapture's inside of you. It's working. It's like that butterfly. It's like that cocoon where all that mess is inside that cocoon. It's working and one day it's going to burst forth as a butterfly. All right, y'all with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. A transformation is taking place in all of us today. Either good or bad. You're either going to walk out of that door better or you're going to walk out that door worse. &gt;&gt; And you know how you do that? You come in here with sin. You come in here with the things of the world and the things you do. &gt;&gt; And if you don't want deliverance, you're going to walk out of that door and God's going to tell you one day, he's going to say, "I give you a chance to be delivered." Right there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if you'll come here and get deliverance and go out that door, you'll go out that door a better person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to go out that door a better person. Who want who come in here wanted to go out bad? &gt;&gt; You want to come in here and hear God tell us something &gt;&gt; that we can take and hold on to? Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; To watch right here in Revelations the 4th chapter. God keeps his word. He brought John up into heaven and rehearsed the whole thing to him. Glory. He saw the preview. Now watch. Here's here's here's the quote. He saw it just as though he lived it on earth and saw the whole church ages come to pass right to the coming of the Lord. The whole book of Revelations. Now we continue on. Paragraph 145. See how infallible his promise is. James didn't do it. Peter didn't do it. John did it. &gt;&gt; One person. There's not two or three brides. &gt;&gt; There's one bride. &gt;&gt; And John typed that one bride. One man. John type the bride. &gt;&gt; Peter's a great man. James is a great man. But God chose John &gt;&gt; to write the book of Revelations and to write it as though he lived it on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now listen, paragraph 145. He quotes the scripture again. What is it to you if he tries till I come and being that he said that he just chose John and took him up and showed him the whole thing before he died? Just like he lived the whole thing through. showed him the church ages, the coming of the Jews, the pouring out of the plagues, the vowels, all the different things, the rapture, the millennium, and the future home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a mouthful, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But if he typed the bride, he had to &gt;&gt; because the bride's in the church ages. When the bride leaves, God goes to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Right. The pouring out of the plagues is when we're gone. It's because we're not here. Listen, the reason this world's not falling apart today is cuz you're sitting there in a pew. [Music] &gt;&gt; God's not going to destroy this world with his bride here. &gt;&gt; We're going to get out of here and then the plagues are going to really fall. But he saw the rapture, which is the bride. He saw the millennium, which is not to the bride, but we'll be in there. And then the future home will be where we live. Just as though he said it again, just as though he lived right through it. So maybe you'll read the Bible a little bit different now. When you read the book of Revelations, uh dad preached sermon many, many years ago or series on the book of Revelations and he called it the bride's book. And it is it's the bride's book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John's there. John's the one that wrote it. And it's either what's going to happen to us, with us, or because of us. &gt;&gt; One of those three is all the bride. &gt;&gt; One more quote and then we'll read scripture. We need to go to Revelations 5. Go ahead and turn there if you want to. Will, brother said, look, paragraph 147. Before his death, he was caught up in the spirit and seen things just as though he had lived it. Seen it all rehearsed. Thus he saw in a vision exactly what would have taken place and what did take place on earth from that time until the coming of the Lord showed it to him in a vision. All right. So let's go to Revelation chapter 5. Is everybody all right? I know it's hot in here. I'm sweating. I know some of you are already went to the land of Nod, but that's where Cain went. So be careful. Revelation chapter 5. Now remember John wrote the church ages. Maybe if you'll start flipping your Bible, you'll Maybe that's what we'll start doing at home instead of putting it on the screen. Make you look for it. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's some action we need a little bit maybe. But remember John in Revelations 1, what did he do? He saw Christ. Saw all of his attributes. Saw all of his manifestations in Revelations chapter one. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And he said it was like unto the son of man. A man standing in the seven golden candlesticks. One liken to the son of man clothed about with the cloud and all the different things. But he come to revelations 4 and it says and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven. What brother said he was caught up in Revelations 4:1. So after the church ages there is a rapture. But remember this is a rehearsal. This is not the real thing yet. &gt;&gt; All right. This is not the real thing. We not I hope the rapture hadn't took place this morning, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz we all missed it. &gt;&gt; All of us. &gt;&gt; So now, what is Revelations chapter 5? Brother Ram said Revelations chapter 5 was the most sublime scripture in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Why? Because something was happened. Something had happened to take us from 1 Corinthians 6 that we read to Romans 8:1. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There had to be a book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There had to be something taken which was we know what it was. We know it was the book, but we know it was a book of names. It was it was us. Because remember in a will to be specific in a will you can't just say I leave my children everything if there's four or five of you &gt;&gt; they going to be a fight &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we just humans going to be a fight but if it says specifically I give Gary I give Aaron I give Wade then that's what The testament has to that's what the will has to do. It enforces, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. It enforc the the one enforces the will and gives Aaron whatever is written on here. Well, that's what Christ has then that's why that's his will. But his will is a mystery. It's been sealed until we look at Revelations 10. We'll look there in just a minute. But Revelation chapter 5, remember the book is closed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is everybody with me? The book is closed in Revelations 5. You can't listen. John has there's going to be another paradox here because down in verse 4, verse 3 and 4, John said, "I wept. There's nobody could even look at it. I I I'm I'm distraught. I don't know what's going on." But you see him over in Revelations 10:1. He's eating a book. He's eating that same book, Brother Bob. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's eating the same book. It's not a different book. It's the same book he was scared of over here. He's eating it over here. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations five. And I saw in the right hand of him sat on the throne a book. Now remember, there's one sitting on a throne, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get into that for save time, but there was one sitting on a throne. That was the father. &gt;&gt; That was the father's throne. And he had the book because remember what happened in the garden of Eden. Brother Bram said God took the book back from Adam. That's right. &gt;&gt; Held it, brought it here as Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that with me? &gt;&gt; That book was inside of that man called Jesus. &gt;&gt; This whole entire book was him. &gt;&gt; Okay. This whole entire book was him. &gt;&gt; So, who had the book? He had the book because it was the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was the book of names. &gt;&gt; My name and your name. But that book was sealed. No man could look at it. But Christ came and he said, "Hey, I'm going to go away, but I'm going to send somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send a comforter. I'm going to send the Holy Ghost." And he's going to help you understand this, but I'm really not going to open it fully until the end time. &gt;&gt; That's what he says. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Revelations 5. So, here's the paradox. We're going from 1 Corinthians 6 where we're all dead. We're all dead in t- trespasses and sin. We have no hope &gt;&gt; to where in Revelations 8:1 we're shouting and praising. I mean Romans 8:1 where we there's no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'll promise you today when before when I started till this moment there has been a thought run through your mind that has condemned you. &gt;&gt; Some of you shaking your head. Some of you are lying. I'll shake mine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. So it was closed. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven, no man in earth, no man under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look at it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And I wept much. Who's I? John. I the bride. If I don't get this mystery, I'm not taking a rapture. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look there on. There's no hope. &gt;&gt; That's what John said. There's no hope for us until God reveals this word to us. &gt;&gt; There's no hope for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, had prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. All right? Now, remember that book couldn't be touched. That book couldn't be looked at. That book couldn't be read. &gt;&gt; I just read you that. That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; That book was a hot item. Nobody wanted it. Nobody could touch it because they weren't worthy to grab a hold of that book. And I behold behold, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came &gt;&gt; and he came &gt;&gt; and took the book out of the hand, right hand of him that sat upon a throne. In other words, he had no problem, Brother Luke, reaching and getting that book. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had no problem that nobody could see it, nobody could understand it, nobody could read it. He went and just picked it up off the throne, the man sitting on the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question. And he come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, there was just a there was just a Pentecostal revival happen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember that book couldn't be touched. Now someone is touching it. All right? That means no one was worthy to reach and get that book except the man that was sitting on the throne and the one that picked it up from the man sitting on the throne. But remember when he picked that book up, listen, when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vows full of odors, which are the prayers of saints, and they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof." All right. Someone is now worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was that? The lamb was the son of man, not the son of God. The lamb was the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that died for us. &gt;&gt; So now, if that was where he's standing, and if we're standing in the son of man dispensation now with this kingdom that he's talking about, we were there with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're shaking your head this way, you you're an unbeliever. Where were we? We were in him. &gt;&gt; All of us were in him. Brother was telling about before the foundation of the world, we were the attributes in the mind of God. Listen, if we were infallible, if we knew everything, I wouldn't know how many children I'd have, what their name would be if I was infinite. That's the reason he knew. He knew every child he was going. He knew every person that was going to be born again. He knew everybody that was going to be in his family because he was infinite, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So then therefore he could predestinate or predetermine what we're talking about by his fornowledge &gt;&gt; coming out of that back part of his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we had to have something happen between Revelations 5 &gt;&gt; and Revelations 10. That's specifically to me and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Be finished in just a few minutes. All right. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So John typed the bride in the ages, but remember John also typed the seventh age bride. Right? &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you in just a second. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in Revelations 5, the lamb takes the book. They singing a new song. Now watch verse 10. Watch verse 10. Now verse 1 2 3 and 4. No hope. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unworthy. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Something has happened and has made us &gt;&gt; right. Amen. unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on or over the earth. Something happened in just about 10 verses that made us worthy to be kings and priests. &gt;&gt; But remember, the book was still closed. &gt;&gt; Book was still closed. He just took the book. He redeemed what was in that book. He took that book. That book was me and you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'll promise you when when John's standing and looking, he said, "Well, I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy." Well, by the time we get over here a little bit further, when that book becomes open, it's going to show us that we're worthy. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Revelations 10 real quick. We'll be finished right here. I hope you know God orchestrated all this just for us. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sure. He sure he loves nature and he loves people. He loves every person. He can't he can't unlove. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He loves. But remember, you got to remember that you got to attach yourself to that love &gt;&gt; because you're a free moral agent to either be able to do it or not be able to do it. All right. Revelations 10:1. All right. This is all of our This is our great This is our um anthem of the believers &gt;&gt; chapter. All right. So, Revelations 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven. You see how God is hiding all this? Because remember when you talk about the covenant angel or the angel of the covenant, it's a capital A. &gt;&gt; This is not. &gt;&gt; So, God's hiding it. It's going to take a prophet, but it wouldn't really take a prophet. It'd just take you to knowing what was look because his his characteristics after that, brother Bob was exactly Revelations 1. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown said, "Only Christ this could be." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, a rainbow upon his head, his face, as it were with sun, and his feet as a pillar of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; All right. a little book open. Now remember, John typed the bride, but John is fixing to type us &gt;&gt; because remember, he couldn't even touch the book. He praised he praised the lamb that he could take the book. &gt;&gt; But over here, John's not going to have a problem reaching and getting the book. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What happened? I'll tell you what happened. He had his hand a little book open and he said his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth. Now there is something I want you to make a little asterisk in your brain if you don't want to write in your Bible cuz we got to come back to that. That is a spec. Everybody believe the word of God is written right correct. No changes. Okay. I just wanted to make sure I was in the same crowd. And he had his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. Who was that? That was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody with me? That was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's another angel going to come into the be involved in this in just a minute. All right. He cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. Now look, brother Ram said John saw who those what they were. He even said Daniel saw the thunders. So, everybody wants to make it a great mystery. The thunders are a great mystery. John was about to write down what they were, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Man's made it everything else, but we're not getting into that later on. That's a another subject for another time. But I was about to write. Remember, John typed the what? &gt;&gt; Bride. Right &gt;&gt; now, here in this chapter, he's going to not be the entire bride cuz the entire bride did not eat an open book. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the angels which is which I saw, now watch again. He said, "Seal up those things that the seven thunders uttered and write them not." And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven. Now who is that? That's Christ, right? That's Christ. &gt;&gt; And swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and things that therein, and the earth, and the things that therein, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer. If we skip down to verse eight, we'll miss the whole thing. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Verse seven says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God, should be finished &gt;&gt; as he has declared to his servants to prophets." Let me read you a couple of uh translations. Brother U Andre and I were talking about this. the there's a translation called the way way wy translation and he's a really good he's a really good uh translator. Now listen we're reading but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to servants the prophets. This is the way the another interpretation of that is then is the secret purpose of God fulfilled according to his message which he give to his servants to prophets. &gt;&gt; Or another translation says moreover at the time when the seventh angel shall speak when he is ready to blow his blast the mysteries will be revealed. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, we know who that was. We know that was Elijah number seven. We know that was William Brandon. We know that for a fact. Is that right? Amen. All right, real quick. But now watch. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God to be finished, as he has declared his service to prophet. We should all read that without even looking at the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we say, well, verse 8, 9, and 10, we know that's John. But here's John doing something that he's never done before. Revelations 5, he couldn't even pick the book up. Revelations 5, he couldn't even look at it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now verse eight. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me and said, go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. &gt;&gt; That's not brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; The book was not taken from the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; That's correct. But without verse seven, you will not know what verse 8, 9, and 10 is. &gt;&gt; Okay? We're not doing away with brother Brown's ministry. But there's a lot of people believe that that book was given to brother Brandham. That book was given to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took the voice of a seventh angel to break that mystery to show us who we are. &gt;&gt; All right. We know who William Brandham is. I want to know who I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me saying, "Go and take." Now, he had a problem with even looking at it. Now, the angels Christ is saying, "John, go and take that book from me. Come and get it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, something happened between Revelations 5 and Revelations 10. Something should have happened between 1 Corinthians 6 and re and Romans 8:1. Something should have happened the day you got born again. from that day till this day you're standing here today. &gt;&gt; There should be an open book somewhere that God say you come and take this book. It's your book. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram's message was my message. &gt;&gt; Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. We know that's Christ. And I went unto the angel and said unto me, I'm not worthy. I can't look at this book. I'm gonna cry because I don't know what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; That's not what that says. &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto him, "Give me. &gt;&gt; Give me my mountain." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me my book. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; And the and and the and the angel said, "No, no, no, John. You you no you you you can't do this. This is not for you. No. What does he say? And immediately the angel says, "Take it and eat it up." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Then it shall make thy belly bitter, and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book &gt;&gt; that was open out of the hands of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I ate it and it disappeared in John. &gt;&gt; He didn't sorry. He didn't throw it back up. &gt;&gt; He ate it and it became John. &gt;&gt; That book that was not worthy to be looked on, not worthy to be handled, now is being eaten by a person. &gt;&gt; And he didn't eat the pages that he liked and kicked the rest of them out. Right. &gt;&gt; They weren't pages laying on the ground when John got finished. Well, I don't think I can do that one. No, that's too much for me. All that stuff right there. I don't think No, he ate the whole book. &gt;&gt; He ate everything there was. There was nothing left for him to do but one thing, and that was to go into all the world. And let me rephrase that and preach the gospel to every creature. Jesus said that before he left, right? Right. &gt;&gt; And you must prophesy to every person you see of all the nations, tongues, kindred, everybody. &gt;&gt; Yes. John was the man that ate the book. &gt;&gt; And who did John represent? &gt;&gt; The bride. But here he represented a specific part of the bride &gt;&gt; cuz not other part of no other part of the bride could eat that book. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry &gt;&gt; because remember it was closed over here. It was open over here. So he was commissioned to eat an open book. &gt;&gt; Everything has been given to me and you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You and I should not have a mystery in our will and where it goes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who it goes to &gt;&gt; and how to handle it. At one time, this book couldn't be handled. &gt;&gt; This book had ideas of man that said, "Well, it's three people. It it's it's water baptism in the other other way. It's it's uh hell's eternal. Uh Eve eat an apple. just let's just keep going. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But once that book became, it took the seventh angel. Let's stand our feet. Come on, musicians. It took an angel. It took Christ to come down on a mountain and give our prophet the seals. &gt;&gt; And then those seals were revealed. All the trumpets, the vows, the plagues, even the thunders, &gt;&gt; everything was revealed. Yes. &gt;&gt; But if brother Brandham came just for himself, he came, God's not going to ever do that, folks. God's going to come and bring a message. And when he brings a message, he brings it to a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? All the way back when brother Woodby and different ones, my dad, different ones, God brought a message through them because I see the fruits of it. &gt;&gt; I see the fruits of it. &gt;&gt; If not, where'd you get it from? Who'd you get it from? Right? &gt;&gt; You got it from the man behind the bullpit &gt;&gt; who preached to you an open book &gt;&gt; who said today come and eat this book. &gt;&gt; Come and let's eat this book together. &gt;&gt; Let's make Oh, it's going to be bitter. We got to live it. But oh, it should be sweet as honey when we put it in there and the word of God starts working and and we see that that that we're part of that book and and then then you know all of a sudden lives start changing around you. You start changing your job changes. Sometimes you it's a transformation folk &gt;&gt; from 1 Corinthians 6 to Romans 8:1. There's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not with a closed book but with an open book. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, thank you for this day you've gi us. May we have said something, Lord, that'll help our people. Lord, it's just it's just us here on earth, Lord. We're human beings and we sometimes we do feel unworthy. Sometimes we feel like that we're just not worthy enough. But Lord, I've got to look to the word of God and I've got to say this everywhere I go that we are worthy. By your stripes, we're healed. &gt;&gt; By your healing power of salvation, our soul can be burned out, Lord. And you come and and be there and reside in our soul by the new birth and make us a new creation, a new creature in Christ. And then Lord, we are then in the bride and now involved in an open book to where we're going to eat this. We're going to eat our way into a body change. Father, bless us. Be with us now as we take a little time here with you, Lord. And and may we eat this book. And oh, it may be bitter sometimes, but Lord, John, eat it all. And everywhere John went after that, he prophesied. He told about the Lord. He went and told people up until the day he died. He was just a very humble man. But he was typing an end time bride that was standing here today right now around the world. We are living under that open book and making that book come to life. Father, be with us. Be with brother Andre and the group here, Father. Strengthen them. Be with us, Lord, on the highways, Lord, as we go eat a little bite there in a in a bit, Lord. But be with us as we continue on our journey home, Lord. that as the wheels turn that we'll say, "Oh, did our hearts not burn within us as we walk together as believers." Father, I thank you for the uh blessings of the people that you have that brought from the church, our church. Lord, that you would be with them. Thank you for each one. Lord, just bless us now. Sanctify us, Lord. Keep us healthy. Keep us centered in your will, Lord. And I I hope that and pray that every morning that we open this book up and we see our name in the will and that you died to give us all these things &gt;&gt; and you gave it to us abundantly. Father, I pray that you'd bless us now in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Andre, God bless you. [Music] They just let his praises ring. Come on. &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy. Appreciate you. That's warm. Go ahead. Thank you. [Music] of the pro. [Music] from the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take that book. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we see the open book, because we are the people of the open book. That's our message. And when we see that great Holy Spirit with the power of transformation &gt;&gt; to move us, the people who pass from death into life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said in the message, who is this mech? Only the predestinated are considered in redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This great plan of God that's &gt;&gt; taken over our lives. As brother Wade was saying, your real you. I'm not going to preach &gt;&gt; your real you. that gene that was locked up in the seals. &gt;&gt; And then the book was open, &gt;&gt; then your life came into view. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how thankful we are. &gt;&gt; Let's take this word &gt;&gt; that we've heard this morning. You say, "Well, brother, I know those things, but these things are reality, a living reality." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if our life is just the same, and we're just doing the same thing and just get the same results. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Then we've got to do something different. &gt;&gt; Amen. to do different is to have that lamb. The lamb that came and took the book in Revelations 5. The lamb that steps from your heart &gt;&gt; and and gives you faith to say, "Lord, that's me. &gt;&gt; That's my life. That's the real me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the one that was in the back part of God's mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's who you are. So, y'all sit for just one &gt;&gt; about two or three minutes. I'm not going to let you go without thanking you for coming. Brother Wade, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank God for these wonderful things. So we certainly want to thank you all for from Lula there, brother Wade, all of you coming up and bringing the fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; It's just been beautiful to have you all up. the Lord has orchestrated these things &gt;&gt; and we look forward to it. This is the third year &gt;&gt; and we was just saying how beautiful. It's just so sweet like it's just it's growing, isn't it? It's it's the family there, the family of God. &gt;&gt; And so you the sacrifices that you all made to come up the church here, we were praying, Lord, give them traveling nurses. Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything they have need of and you came and we had fellowship Friday there and seeing you come in. I tried to run and and shake your hands and say, "God bless you. Thanks for coming." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and brother Way can tell you, I was like, "Where's this brother at? Where's this family at? When are they coming?" "No, brother.
