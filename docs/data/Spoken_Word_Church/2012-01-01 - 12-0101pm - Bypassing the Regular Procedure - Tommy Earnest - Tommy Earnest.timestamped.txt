[23:28] by our Prophet 40 years ago or 50 years
[23:33] ago and it it's not time stamped it's
[23:36] not time dat right am I got one here for
[23:39] you this morning and and I wanted to
[23:40] begin with this just had it come on
[23:43] strong on my heart this morning brother
[23:44] brandom asked a question he says this is
[23:47] out of a message called my new ministry
[23:49] he says did you
[23:50] know that God knew that we'd be standing
[23:54] here 10 million years before the world
[23:57] was ever
[23:59] amen did you know that God knew that we'
[24:02] be standing you know you might think
[24:04] well I just made a wrong turn and ended
[24:05] up at the wrong church this
[24:07] morning but did you know that God knew
[24:10] that 10 million years before the world
[24:11] was ever formed you know how he like to
[24:14] talk about this did you know he knew
[24:15] we'd be standing here this morning the
[24:18] infin infiny of God knowed every fly
[24:21] every NAD every time they had bat their
[24:23] eyes and how much Tallow they would
[24:25] produce before the world was ever
[24:28] he says now you'll say well if he knows
[24:31] it then why are you preaching that's a
[24:34] good question is God knows the end what
[24:36] what's what's all the in between stuff
[24:38] going on then why are you preaching he
[24:41] says that's part of God's program y
[24:44] preaching is his program right amen you
[24:47] know I like one quote I didn't bring it
[24:48] along because I you know I don't know I
[24:50] run into a lot of tape people that
[24:52] believe you just got to just get it off
[24:54] the tape but there's one place brother
[24:56] BR says God does not use mechanic IAL
[24:58] devices to deliver his word preaching is
[25:02] part of his program when he looked upon
[25:03] the apostles he looked on the Harvest he
[25:06] said the Harvest is right the laborers
[25:08] are few pray the Lord of the Harvest as
[25:09] he'll send laborers into his Harvest how
[25:11] many remember that amen well why would
[25:14] they have to pray to the Lord of harvest
[25:15] to send laborers into his Harvest if the
[25:18] Lord of harvest was standing there
[25:20] knowing it would be done if he know it
[25:23] was going to end up this way brother
[25:25] Randon is asking the question why he
[25:27] says why he says God has so arranged it
[25:30] and he says now listen to this God has
[25:32] so arranged it that his program cannot
[25:35] move without you and I and as long as
[25:38] we're not doing what God leads us to do
[25:41] we're paralyzing his program but when
[25:44] the church moves by the anointing of the
[25:45] Holy Ghost then we're in God's will
[25:47] right doing his program how many want to
[25:50] do his program yes sir all right our
[25:53] text this morning will come out of John
[25:55] chap 4 if you'll turn there this morning
[26:00] morning while you're still standing in
[26:03] John the 4th
[26:05] chapter and we'll begin in verse
[26:08] 30 then they went out of the city and
[26:11] came unto him in the meanwhile his
[26:14] disciples prayed him saying Master eat
[26:18] man I you know you don't have to
[26:19] remember me as a guy who like to preach
[26:21] about hunger and food yeah right in the
[26:24] meanwhile his disciples prayed him
[26:26] saying Master eat but he said unto them
[26:28] I have meat to eat that you know not of
[26:31] therefore said the disciples one to
[26:33] another hath any man brought him ought
[26:35] to eat Jesus saith unto them and I
[26:38] thought this was a good scripture for
[26:40] 2012 my meat is to do the will of him
[26:43] that sent me amen and to finish his work
[26:47] you know finishing his work is a big
[26:50] part of this program brother brandom
[26:52] said all that God didn't complete in his
[26:55] Earthly journey is being completed now
[26:58] in the lady Jesus Christ that's the meat
[27:01] of the father let's pray this morning
[27:02] Heavenly Father we do want to do our
[27:05] part we want to do our our our portion
[27:08] Lord to be a part of the program of God
[27:11] and to finish this work we are in the
[27:13] finishing hours yeah what brother
[27:15] Brandon believing in the days that he
[27:17] stood here that it was the last hours
[27:19] the last days and and here 40 more years
[27:22] later we're still in those last
[27:24] finishing hours we don't understand the
[27:27] the time line we don't try to decipher
[27:29] it figure it out place a final date on
[27:31] it figure out how many are going all of
[27:34] those things will leave to others Lord
[27:35] but we just continue walking in your
[27:38] light as you lead us help us tonight
[27:40] this day as we as we go into the service

[29:06] certainly puts our brother Jim under a
[29:08] lot of pressure I know he's there
[29:09] ministering this morning as we got to
[29:11] log in for a few minutes with him and
[29:13] then he's got the funeral memorial
[29:15] service for his mother-in-law tomorrow
[29:17] so if y'all just are are wandering
[29:19] around tomorrow around lunchtime and
[29:21] think of them and just offer up a little
[29:24] a little prayer for the family there
[29:25] she's a sweet lady she's been a a part
[29:27] of our assembly and it just gives us
[29:30] somebody else on the other side pulling
[29:32] for us to get there that's right and U
[29:35] you know death doesn't doesn't alter our
[29:38] vision it doesn't alter our view it just
[29:40] gives us gives us a little more reward
[29:42] to go to right what brother Rand say
[29:44] he's just just hooking The Chariot death
[29:46] is just hooking on and pulling us some
[29:48] of us on over to the other side but
[29:50] whether we're asleep or whether we're
[29:53] awake it doesn't matter Paul said just
[29:55] to be found in him so so it's it's no
[29:59] disgrace to go on and it's no disgrace
[30:01] to stay right you know we had years ago
[30:04] I learned a little lesson we had two
[30:05] sisters in our assembly there in Florida
[30:07] both of them came down with breast
[30:09] cancer exactly at the same time within
[30:12] within days of each other they were both
[30:14] diagnosed one of them being leaning a
[30:16] little more to the medical side she
[30:17] wanted to have the doctor's treatment
[30:19] done for her cancer the chemotherapy and
[30:22] the radiation and all the things that
[30:24] they can do another sister saids no I
[30:26] just want to believe on the Lord because
[30:28] if it's my time to go and and he won't
[30:30] heal me then I'm where I'm supposed to
[30:32] be the it was no disgrace that the one
[30:35] sister passed and the one made it they
[30:37] chose different routes right now you get
[30:39] a lot of folks who say Well the lady
[30:41] with the doctor ought to went the other
[30:42] way well you know I don't know how
[30:45] strong y'all I don't know how much the
[30:47] medicine preachers got around to y'all
[30:48] in the days gone by but I've known of
[30:51] preachers that go out and dump out
[30:52] handbags to see who's got that devil
[30:54] Tylenol in their purse you know and all
[30:56] those kind of thing I remember years ago
[30:59] as a young man I went down to Hot
[31:00] Springs Arkansas and I was sitting in it
[31:02] was a Pentecostal church but we had met
[31:04] the brother and we were just visiting
[31:05] and and and them knowing we were in the
[31:07] message they had been in brother
[31:09] brandom's meetings down in Arkansas and
[31:11] and this man got up and and he wanted to
[31:13] give this testimony about how he went to
[31:15] Brother bram's service because he was
[31:18] having trouble with his eyes and he
[31:19] wanted to be healed and his whole
[31:22] testimony was he says you know I knew as
[31:24] soon as brother brandham came out that I
[31:26] wasn't going to get my healing because
[31:28] he took a pair of glasses out of his
[31:30] pocket and put them
[31:32] on and he he did that for my benefit I'm
[31:35] sure you know that that I knew that his
[31:37] faith was bursted by that little act
[31:40] right yeah you know there was I didn't
[31:43] bring it but there was one quote brother
[31:44] brandom said a man came to me and said
[31:46] brother brandom I can't believe you're
[31:47] eating sausage gravy you remember that
[31:50] yeah he said so if all I got to worry
[31:53] about keeping me out of Heaven is
[31:54] sausage gra he says I've been pretty
[31:56] good sh you
[31:58] know but uh but that that's just just
[32:02] how it is the Lord knows every one of
[32:04] our footsteps is ordered if he knew 10
[32:07] million years before the world was ever
[32:09] founded that we would be here he knows
[32:10] where I'm going to be
[32:12] tomorrow you know the only surprises we
[32:14] have here in the end time is is us God
[32:18] knew God knew already every every step
[32:21] everything about it amen he knows and
[32:23] our steps are certainly ordered and
[32:25] ordained of him but but I did enjoy last
[32:28] night that's about as long as as I've
[32:31] ever preached or or wanted to ever
[32:33] preach that was you know I certainly
[32:35] heard about it afterwards because
[32:38] brother Wade was the last guy we had do
[32:39] two hours at our place and so now that
[32:41] I've even the
[32:43] score you know one guy with one brother
[32:45] I won't say who but he was telling me
[32:48] that you don't have rollover minutes
[32:50] when you go short and you don't I've
[32:51] done use my whole month's Supply up on
[32:54] my whole time plans finished up and
[32:57] why is it guys like that when you
[32:59] mention those quotes where brother BR
[33:00] said the ought to preach 30 or 45
[33:02] minutes why do they just that's all they
[33:03] ever hear right why is that you know
[33:06] they like those don't they you usually
[33:07] get some amens out of that so to balance
[33:10] the score I have another quote for you
[33:12] this morning is that okay cuz I don't
[33:14] want to leave and brother Dale be all
[33:16] under pressure about time so so so this
[33:19] is out of a message called the unwelcome
[33:21] Christ and brother B's talking about how
[33:23] we got time for other things he says we
[33:27] got time for other things and he's in
[33:29] quotes he's speaking as if a man's out
[33:31] there a fellow would say oh I wish he'd
[33:34] hurry up and quit preaching 20 minutes
[33:36] is long enough for any preacher to
[33:38] preach now that's what somebody out in
[33:40] the crowd is saying he said why he says
[33:43] you're starving to death you're so thin
[33:47] you look like a shadow you need
[33:49] everybody ready now you need a good 4our
[33:53] sermon sometimes
[33:55] right right how many believe this
[33:59] message all right y'all with me you need
[34:03] not you ought to have but you need a
[34:05] good 4our sermon sometime to fatten you
[34:09] up on gospel
[34:11] vitamins that's what the church needs
[34:13] today amen so don't get all upset if he
[34:16] decides that that that 3 weeks from
[34:19] today y'all need a good 4-Hour sermon
[34:22] amen because he's got a quote to back
[34:24] him
[34:25] up you know
[34:27] I'm not am I making that up is that what
[34:29] it says yeah that's what mine says you
[34:32] need you guys that think 20 minutes is
[34:35] long enough you're the ones that need a
[34:37] good 4
[34:40] sometime in another place brother says
[34:43] the church needs some vitamins it's got
[34:45] anemic it's it's become anemia its nerve
[34:49] system has run down y now I'll tell you
[34:52] God's got a whole Storehouse full of
[34:53] vitamins yes sir amen that's right it'll
[34:56] beat all they got in the
[34:57] drugstore a you know had a call going to
[35:00] take the place of the just accept them
[35:03] spiritual vitamins and it'll Build You
[35:05] Up A peculiar people a holy nation amen
[35:08] and amen and amen how many believe that
[35:10] that's right so just keep that in mind
[35:12] you need it if if you if you get a 4
[35:15] hour coming up then just remember you
[35:16] need that I don't know why you needed
[35:19] that right I'm going to just live by my
[35:22] my my friends from Trinidad's slogan
[35:24] there though if we go three hours and
[35:26] it's seems like 45 minutes and we have
[35:29] not done an
[35:31] injustice because most of us don't start
[35:34] count until we get done rambling anyway
[35:36] see we actually need one of those time
[35:39] clocks that when we start preaching then
[35:41] we can put it on and then if we diverse
[35:44] out and do a little more rambling then
[35:45] we can stop the clock and then we go
[35:47] back to preaching we can put it back on
[35:49] again and if your pastor is so inclined
[35:52] to do a little meddling during his
[35:53] meddling time you can put a little time
[35:54] out there as well yeah a man ought to
[35:57] preach only 45 minutes there the
[36:00] rambling medling warming up and cooling
[36:03] down period should not count against
[36:08] him is that all right come
[36:12] on see the thing is you all start the
[36:15] clock as soon as you fall into your
[36:16] chair yeah oh clock's on now he's not on
[36:19] the clock yet he ain't warmed up he
[36:22] ain't rambled he ain't medled he ain't
[36:24] done none of those things yet he gets 45
[36:27] minutes preaching yeah there you go it's
[36:30] just the way I'm just just trying to
[36:31] help I'm going to be long gone I just
[36:33] want to help before you
[36:36] know I just want to I just want to help
[36:39] all I can I like to balance I like to be
[36:42] balanced how many believe this message
[36:45] has a
[36:46] balance that's why it's talking we all I
[36:48] know yall agree with me on Christmas man
[36:50] people get so bound up about Christmas
[36:53] brother Jim a couple weeks ago took a
[36:55] little message and he he took one place
[36:57] place where brother random said
[36:59] Christmas ought not to be a celebration
[37:02] he said it ought to be a worship it
[37:03] ought to be a time of Honor we shouldn't
[37:05] be celebrating Christmas and then in
[37:08] another message sometime later he says
[37:10] now we're entering into our Christmas
[37:12] celebration this week so which way is it
[37:15] do we celebrate or don't we celebrate
[37:18] there is a balance to this word and most
[37:21] of the legalism and most of the false
[37:24] things that have come out of this
[37:25] message is because one guy swayed too
[37:27] far right one way or the other because
[37:30] because they only read one batch of
[37:32] quotes and didn't read the whole message
[37:35] and that's why I printed out all those
[37:36] Christmas messages you listen to all 17
[37:39] or 18 of them how many there were and
[37:41] you decide what brother Brandon believed
[37:43] about Christmas you decide what he
[37:44] believed about any event right but
[37:47] instead of that you know what we'll
[37:49] always do we just run ask the pastor let
[37:51] me ask him what we believe why don't you
[37:53] search it out for yourself exactly well
[37:56] you know this you got the if you don't
[37:57] have the message on your computer I know
[38:00] brother Jim got real excited at home one
[38:01] time he said if you ain't got the
[38:03] message on your computer you don't even
[38:04] have the Holy
[38:06] Ghost now I never saw brother Brandon
[38:08] qualified that way because back in his
[38:11] day he didn't even know there was going
[38:12] to be a computer and a message to have
[38:14] on the computer but I loved it that's
[38:16] right what you got a computer in your
[38:18] house for if it ain't got the quotes on
[38:21] right where that you can hear Brother
[38:23] Wade or Brother Sam stand up and say
[38:25] something and you maybe didn't get it
[38:26] just right rather than burn the
[38:29] telephone line up to ask him what he me
[38:31] why don't you go read it yourself and
[38:33] God will show you what the true
[38:36] intention of that was so I hope you all
[38:38] Scurry home and get it on your computers
[38:40] or according to brother Jim you ain't
[38:42] even got the holy ghost son that's his
[38:44] Doctrine I'm
[38:46] not I was grateful at the time I had
[38:48] about five computers in my house and
[38:50] they all had it on it so I was just glad
[38:52] that I passed the the litmus test but do
[38:55] use the know these resources to be able
[38:58] to print off the quotes I started
[39:00] preaching in
[39:01] 1979 we didn't have the computer we
[39:03] didn't have the message info base and
[39:06] for us to bring you a quote we had to
[39:08] get it out of the books and so when we
[39:10] all come up here you remember how we all
[39:12] showed up like this we had books under
[39:15] our arms out both sides because we had
[39:17] one quote and we didn't have copy
[39:18] machines most of us so we had to bring
[39:21] all them books we had them marked up
[39:23] lined up we had them paragraphed and
[39:25] paper clip and and yellowed out and
[39:28] highlighted exactly and then the
[39:31] computer came along and it led us not
[39:34] only look at those that were in print
[39:36] which I think in
[39:38] 1979 when I started preaching we might
[39:40] had a couple of hundred of the books in
[39:42] print by then 200 maybe 300 now you can
[39:45] print them all but at that time we just
[39:47] had a A small collection of them right y
[39:50] we had the what Jeffersonville deemed
[39:52] the most important ones and I never knew
[39:54] how they figured that out yeah you know
[39:56] there was a little gospel Doctrine going
[39:58] around way back in the old days I
[40:00] remember that there was tapes that were
[40:02] divided in categories some of them were
[40:04] called seed tapes remember those days
[40:07] exactly did you get that off of one of
[40:08] those seed tapes well well I thought all
[40:11] of the spoken word was the original seed
[40:13] so but they would ask you that was that
[40:16] off of a seed tape well I'm not sure
[40:18] which one that was you're referring to
[40:20] but they had a little collection of of
[40:22] Christ the mystery and mighty God unveil
[40:24] and power transformation those were the
[40:26] seed tapes the Rapture you know but um
[40:30] anyway that's what we had to work with
[40:32] now you got the computer right and you
[40:34] got the message to put on it and it's
[40:36] it's available don't go without it don't
[40:39] take an opportunity if you got 10
[40:41] minutes spare time I know you want to
[40:43] play with the grandchildren but go look
[40:45] up something go put it in your mind go
[40:47] dwell on it right exactly don't don't
[40:49] don't forsake the grandchildren Let Them
[40:51] Sit along with you on your knee while
[40:53] you read and while you look let that be
[40:55] a part of your life that's right let
[40:57] this message be more important to you
[41:00] than any other aspect of your life right
[41:04] let it be so that's my prayer for this
[41:06] year Lord let it be more real to me more
[41:08] important more valuable than it's ever
[41:11] been before
[41:13] amen that is my prayer that's my prayer
[41:15] for you as well but again back to to our
[41:18] home Church they remember our brothers
[41:19] tomorrow our sister Pinkston and the
[41:22] loss of her mothers two of her other
[41:24] daughters attend the assembly there so
[41:26] there's a little bit of sadness in the
[41:27] home front but we pray that the Lord
[41:29] will just help them help them and
[41:31] encourage them today we're going to just
[41:32] continue a little thought that we we
[41:34] began there at the end last
[41:37] night uh uh especially about what
[41:39] brother Bram talked about bypassing the
[41:42] regular procedure you know that I
[41:44] mentioned just some common common carnal
[41:48] things that's hard on us guys you know
[41:50] right how that we fail so many times in
[41:52] believing you know I I just I'm just I
[41:55] just like everything you know I like
[41:57] what the scripture said let everything
[41:58] be done decently and in order right and
[42:00] so in order is is diverted but I would
[42:03] like to read with you one more place if
[42:05] you will over in Mark chapter
[42:07] 2 Mark the 2 chapter I'd like to read
[42:11] this and it'll help us get into our
[42:17] subject I did want to thank brother Wade
[42:19] for the hospitality of his home he
[42:21] opened up his his house to us there gave
[42:23] us a lovely a lovely place place to stay
[42:27] and everything we need Diet Coke in the
[42:29] fridge and and everything is there so I
[42:31] appreciate that brother thank you for
[42:33] that it's just an honor to to share your
[42:36] home with you like that amen but in Mark
[42:38] chapter
[42:40] 2 we find verse 23 a very
[42:44] unusual an unusual little scene in in
[42:47] the ministry of Our Lord verse 23 it
[42:49] came to pass that he went through the
[42:51] corn fields on the Sabbath day and his
[42:54] disciples began as they went to pluck
[42:58] the ears of
[42:59] corn and the Pharisees said unto him now
[43:03] you know I just want to stop for a
[43:04] minute these disciples were not
[43:06] untrained unlearned completely I know
[43:09] Peter was a little ignorant at times but
[43:11] some of them had some some learnings
[43:13] right some of them have been around
[43:15] Church long enough to know you know you
[43:18] look at Luke The Physician you look at
[43:20] and some of the other apostles were they
[43:22] were not just just totally incoherently
[43:27] doing something that the Pharisees all
[43:30] I'm trying to say is the Pharisees
[43:31] didn't need to be the first ones to
[43:33] point it out I mean Jesus and the
[43:35] disciples are going through the corn
[43:37] field and his disciples began as they
[43:39] went to pluck the ears of corn and the
[43:41] Pharisees said behold why do they on the
[43:44] Sabbath day that which is not
[43:46] lawful it wasn't like the 12 disciples
[43:49] were standing around saying H we didn't
[43:51] know yeah yeah come on we didn't know
[43:53] what we were doing we you mean we can't
[43:55] pluck corn on the Sabbath it wasn't like
[43:58] Jesus stopped as he said about John and
[44:00] send him a book of conduct on how to
[44:01] behave while he's in prison right he
[44:04] didn't stop his disciples and say what
[44:06] are you doing why are you why are you
[44:08] breaking the Sabbath let me show you my
[44:11] pamphlet on how to observe the sabbath
[44:13] yeah yeah let's go back and read Church
[44:15] order again and make sure that we're
[44:17] doing it exactly right he's going
[44:20] through the Field of Corn his his
[44:21] disciples are plucking the corn but it's
[44:23] the Pharisees that get riled up about it
[44:26] right now one thing I don't know of
[44:28] course there's some debate whether this
[44:30] is truly corn because all of us have
[44:33] pluck corn I mean but it could be wheat
[44:37] it could be corn there's a great debate
[44:38] among all the theologians about which
[44:40] one it is but if it was truly corn as we
[44:43] know corn and they were out plucking
[44:44] ears of corn and the Pharisees are on
[44:47] the tear it would be easy to hide
[44:49] yourself in a field of corn and not be
[44:52] discovered yeah right come on we've all
[44:54] been in corn fields
[44:56] how many ever played a game of hiding in
[44:58] the cornfield sure unless you see the
[45:00] top of the stalk Rippling they could
[45:02] have avoided these Pharisees but
[45:04] obviously they were coming out to the
[45:05] end of the rad with a big old armload of
[45:07] corn yeah they weren't just just they
[45:11] were not trying to conceal their
[45:13] activities this is what I'm wanting to
[45:14] say to you am I think sometimes we get
[45:17] all worried and frustrated and worked up
[45:20] about not letting somebody else know how
[45:23] we do it down in our church you in one
[45:26] of those
[45:27] scenarios I've got a I've got a website
[45:29] but it's password
[45:32] protected we'll find the world you want
[45:34] to have a p a website with your sermons
[45:36] on it if you've got a password
[45:40] protected why bother to build this
[45:43] website well I don't want nobody to hear
[45:45] what I'm saying well don't have a
[45:47] website
[45:49] then now y I hope y'all ain't password
[45:52] protected after saying all
[45:54] that because we we want to have a church
[45:56] we want to have a little a little
[45:58] commune of of people here and we want to
[46:00] do it our way and we don't want nobody
[46:02] else to know how we do
[46:04] it the disciples weren't like that this
[46:06] was in plain view of the
[46:08] Pharisees because I want you to know
[46:11] something brothers and sisters no matter
[46:12] how many times we read Church order no
[46:15] matter how many times we measure the
[46:18] sister's hymn at the door and their
[46:20] heels as they walk in that somewhere
[46:23] along the way we're not going to get it
[46:25] right oh somebody's going to show up a
[46:28] little off a little out of kilter
[46:30] because we're measuring it by man's
[46:32] standard right I want to say this to you
[46:35] and I mean it with all my heart there is
[46:37] a we were left with church order brother
[46:39] random laid down what we call Church
[46:41] order to help us have an order in our
[46:44] services but I want you to know there is
[46:46] a higher order than that there is an
[46:48] order that's called bride order amen and
[46:51] if we are in Bride order we don't have
[46:53] to worry about church order because Bri
[46:56] order supersedes Church
[46:59] order if your heart is right to dress
[47:02] right live right act right do everything
[47:04] right Y and your heart is right between
[47:07] you and God concerning those things then
[47:09] you'll never break Church order right
[47:12] bride order super supersedes Church
[47:15] order if you see a a member a a long
[47:19] standing member a newcomer whoever it
[47:21] may be breaking Church order to the rule
[47:26] this is exactly what was happening the
[47:27] Pharisees says hey wait a minute your
[47:29] disciples aren't acting like the law
[47:32] said they should act you're the people
[47:34] in your church ain't doing it the way we
[47:36] do it down at our church and we believe
[47:39] in church order come on brother brothers
[47:42] and sisters Jesus said verse 25 and he
[47:46] said un them have you never read oh man
[47:49] nothing like taking it back to somebody
[47:51] they had confidence in right have you
[47:53] never read what David did
[47:56] when he had need and was hungry he and
[47:59] they that were with him how he went into
[48:01] the house of God in the days of abiathar
[48:03] the high priest and he ate the showbread
[48:06] right it's not lawful to eat but for the
[48:09] priest and he not only ate it but he
[48:11] gave also to them that were with
[48:14] him broke Church order yeah have you
[48:18] never read that David got out of line
[48:20] back there that David broke the order of
[48:22] the law he broke the Commandment he
[48:25] broke the the the defined definition of
[48:28] how the church ought to act yeah but you
[48:30] let a person get crosswise with the
[48:32] assembly you know what the first thing
[48:33] they'll Point as is church order y'all
[48:36] do this and y'all do that yall do this
[48:37] and yall do
[48:40] that we're all still looking for the
[48:43] perfect church right yeah right the
[48:46] perfect Church exactly do you think one
[48:51] exists the perfect church I got a little
[48:53] po you want to PO how many know poetry
[48:56] is good brother Jim read this years ago
[48:59] and I I I took it's on the internet and
[49:01] you'll find it there
[49:03] but this is called the perfect Church no
[49:07] perfect church is the title of this
[49:08] point and it goes like this I think that
[49:11] I shall never see a church that's all it
[49:15] ought to be a church whose members never
[49:18] stray beyond the straight and narrow way
[49:21] a church that has no empty pews whose
[49:24] Pastor never has the
[49:26] Blues a church whose deacons always deak
[49:29] and none is proud and all are
[49:31] Meek where gossips never pedal lie or
[49:34] make complaints or criticize right where
[49:37] all are always sweet and kind and all to
[49:40] others faults are
[49:42] blind such perfect churches there may be
[49:44] but none of them are known to me but
[49:47] still we work and pray and plan to make
[49:50] our own the best we
[49:52] can is't that the right desire to have
[49:55] right no perfect Church sorry to burst
[49:58] your bubble right we have church order
[50:00] to help and guide us but there will be a
[50:03] perfect Church come out of all the
[50:05] imperfection that we can muster up right
[50:08] because when he saw her walking on that
[50:10] straight highway and she began to wave
[50:12] her off to the side he screamed and said
[50:14] get back in line and it caught her
[50:17] attention and it got her back in line
[50:19] right amen and that's the confidence we
[50:21] have in the word here in the end time
[50:23] right that it's little B
[50:26] and blemishes of the record hit along
[50:28] the way that God will take care of that
[50:31] the first thing we do though is we ran
[50:34] run and get our church order book yeah
[50:36] we get our we get what brother brandom
[50:38] said right here and he said right here
[50:40] and he said right here and he said over
[50:42] there and we begin to play the church
[50:44] order over and over and over just
[50:47] because of of of a blemish of
[50:50] imperfection right we're not perfect yet
[50:53] brothers and sisters every one of us
[50:56] and I I try everywhere I go and as often
[50:58] as I can speak into
[51:00] congregations I I just want to ask you
[51:02] every day that you go to your job are
[51:04] you always on form that's what you know
[51:07] but we look at our dear Pastor he' been
[51:09] here what 40 Years 1972 I think you were
[51:12] telling me somewhere in there that you
[51:14] started the assembly here it why is it
[51:17] that we'll show up on our jobs sometimes
[51:19] and just be half there come on come on
[51:23] this ain't going to be fun is it this is
[51:25] my medling time put me off the clock
[51:27] right
[51:29] here why is it that we can show up down
[51:31] on the assembly line and not be on 100%
[51:34] form come on maybe we got a headache
[51:37] maybe we didn't get enough sleep last
[51:38] night maybe we had a scrap with the wife
[51:40] on the way yeah before we got to work
[51:43] and we're not on 100% form but yet when
[51:46] our pastor stands behind the pull pit
[51:48] day after day doing his job yeah it's
[51:51] always got to be exactly right yeah come
[51:55] on why is that yeah not fair right I'm a
[51:59] preacher I'm going to declare it now
[52:05] foul you don't know that maybe he's got
[52:08] a headache this morning maybe he kicked
[52:10] the cat on the way out the
[52:14] door it's not fair right you require
[52:17] that every time he's up here if he if he
[52:20] were to repeat himself from last week I
[52:23] know our folks at home will do it
[52:24] brother Jimmy already said that so
[52:27] what so
[52:30] what but we're required well you already
[52:33] preached that here while back we've
[52:34] already heard that move on to something
[52:36] else since when did you get to
[52:37] quarterback what God is
[52:39] doing and since when is he placed in
[52:42] such a pedestal that he's got to be on
[52:44] Forum every week give him a chance to
[52:48] have a bad
[52:49] day sometimes brother random had bubles
[52:52] and little blips on the radar right sure
[52:55] surely you remember
[52:57] 77,000 oh man he no more than got it out
[53:01] than they were already sitting in the
[53:02] question did you mean 77,000 yeah I got
[53:05] so tired of him having to correct that
[53:07] 77,000 did you it's we're all humans
[53:12] right we wake up like you do we we go to
[53:15] sleep like you do and some nights we
[53:17] don't get enough like you do like last
[53:20] night I see you all nodding out there as
[53:24] I get into my 4our
[53:28] sermon you need a 4-Hour
[53:32] sermon all I'm saying brothers and
[53:34] sisters is with the same Grace that you
[53:36] need give it to our brother here as he
[53:39] stands in the desk we don't come behind
[53:41] this desk every day in tiptop shape
[53:44] right we don't come here in perfect form
[53:46] we have headaches we have aches in our
[53:48] body we have groanings we have
[53:50] travailing we have things that are heavy
[53:52] on our mind like you do when you go to
[53:53] your job right so if he if he if a
[53:56] little blip on the radar shows up don't
[53:58] run and grab Church order and let him
[54:00] know that was too long this was too
[54:02] short the singing's too loud the music
[54:05] the preaching there's always going to be
[54:07] something that we maybe could do a
[54:09] little better right oh yeah we I could
[54:12] always do a better job preaching than
[54:13] what I do but give our brothers some
[54:15] Grace but this is this was a noticeable
[54:18] event in the disciples life it was not
[54:20] the regular routine right here Jesus and
[54:23] the disciples are going through the Cor
[54:25] and they're plucking corn and the
[54:26] Pharisees are like
[54:28] foul they're they're calling a foul on
[54:30] them what what are your disciples doing
[54:33] it's the Sabbath right he was bypassing
[54:36] the regular procedure right and rather
[54:39] than just say hey wait a minute I I just
[54:41] want you to know that I told them they
[54:43] could and so take that and put that in
[54:45] your pipe and smoke it because that's
[54:47] just the way it is yeah I'm afraid so
[54:49] much of the message preaching has gone
[54:51] to that this is what brother BR said and
[54:53] this is the way I see it and you just
[54:55] Believe it or else you're just lost oh
[54:57] come on you've had enough of those
[54:59] preachers come by I imagine in your life
[55:01] it's this way and this is the only way
[55:02] it can be and if you don't believe it
[55:04] you're just out you're not going to make
[55:05] it and Cults have rose up inside of this
[55:08] message preaching all kind of foul
[55:11] things and finding quotes to back it up
[55:13] churches filled with polygamy Believers
[55:16] believing that somehow brother Brandon
[55:17] thought polygamy was okay yeah polygamy
[55:20] was not okay it's not okay in our
[55:22] society you know old but they'll that
[55:25] quote up and brother and S I would
[55:26] rather America be a polygamous Nation
[55:28] than what we've got yeah so they're all
[55:30] saying amen that's exactly right yeah
[55:33] they forgot to go on read and he says
[55:35] now you know I don't believe in polygamy
[55:37] but he was just looking at it being a
[55:40] better alternative right I was having
[55:42] some fellowship here while back up in
[55:44] Ohio with a brother and his his daughter
[55:46] was was was liking a a man that was
[55:49] attending a polygamy Church the pastor
[55:51] was preaching the polygamy was okay and
[55:53] here this man's daughter is in it is is
[55:55] struck up a relationship with a boy out
[55:57] of there if I was the dad you know what
[56:00] I'd be asking I wouldn't even actually
[56:01] be asking any I'd be saying ain't no way
[56:03] this is going to be
[56:04] happening amen the answer was well yeah
[56:08] I attend this church and I I know they
[56:10] believe in polygamy and I really believe
[56:11] it but I would never do
[56:13] it come on right something's not adding
[56:16] up here I believe it I believe it but I
[56:18] would never do it yeah believe it but
[56:21] never do it that's fine when you're
[56:24] young and healthy and beautiful and your
[56:26] wife has not got no wrinkles and the
[56:28] crows feet haven't showed up you're
[56:31] believing it now but wait until you both
[56:33] get old and gray and you think that
[56:35] there's something out there for you more
[56:37] wild and wonderful than what you have
[56:40] brothers and sisters all I'm saying to
[56:42] you is that there's things that you can
[56:45] make the message say I was talking to
[56:47] this brother and you know what his
[56:48] defense was he took a quote where
[56:50] brother brandom said you men go on and
[56:52] live with your wives yeah you men out
[56:55] there go and live with your wives and
[56:58] they took that to be that brother
[56:59] brandham was enforcing polygamy he could
[57:02] have had two men sitting there with two
[57:04] wives that he was talking to right and
[57:06] the and the quote men entirely something
[57:08] different from that right but we've had
[57:10] 45 years now to take these quotes and to
[57:13] make them say things that they didn't
[57:15] say we we we've had an opportunity to to
[57:18] take the message and because of the
[57:20] computer and all of its wonderful help
[57:22] it can also be a curse because everybody
[57:25] can run and and and and try to find
[57:28] something Al alternately different y i I
[57:32] liked what our brother said last night
[57:33] Paul said if you got to preach it out of
[57:35] condition contention I'm glad that it's
[57:37] preached exactly but it's a whole lot
[57:39] nicer when it's not out of contention
[57:41] EXA all I'm saying to you brothers and
[57:43] sisters is that there is a church order
[57:45] there's a perfect way that everything in
[57:48] our mind we have decided it should be
[57:50] done but if it varies let's just believe
[57:54] that God God leads his dear children
[57:56] along if it doesn't measure up to
[57:58] exactly the way you think it ought to be
[58:00] yeah I went to a church I attended had a
[58:03] years ago when I was single dated a girl
[58:05] over in Arkansas at a church and every
[58:08] time if a if a sister had a little
[58:10] struggle in the faith or a young person
[58:12] or whatever and a girl would trim her
[58:13] hair they had questions and answers
[58:15] every Sunday morning yeah you let you
[58:18] let a young sister have a struggle and
[58:20] and maybe just trim off her hair a
[58:21] little bit or something there'd be the
[58:22] question on the pull pit what did
[58:24] Brother random say about a woman cutting
[58:26] her hair yeah they didn't they already
[58:28] knew what brother random said and the
[58:29] whole church already knew what brother
[58:31] random said but they just wanted that
[58:32] girl pounded on for a while and so the
[58:35] pounding would begin that's not what
[58:37] this gospel was to do if you see a
[58:40] brother overtaken in a fall amen pray
[58:43] for that man hold up for that man he is
[58:46] your brother he has claimed this body as
[58:48] a part of his assembly as a part of his
[58:50] place of worship believe in that man
[58:53] with him pray those young people through
[58:55] those struggles help them through those
[58:57] hard times that they go through amen
[59:00] unless you were never young and never
[59:02] had any Hard Times yourself right yes I
[59:05] I can remember my
[59:07] youth I know you're thinking that wasn't
[59:09] very long ago and that's true it wasn't
[59:11] very long ago not like the not like
[59:13] these birthday people over here I didn't
[59:15] know it was your birthday I I got you
[59:18] something you
[59:19] know there's the 26 you got time oh I
[59:22] got
[59:23] time
[59:27] all
[59:29] right bypassing here's our Point
[59:31] bypassing the regular procedure I don't
[59:34] know what 2012 is going to entail for us
[59:38] I don't know I you know I'll give you my
[59:40] little testimony about how I got to
[59:42] Kansas we were we were just tripping
[59:46] along in 2010 and everything was fine
[59:49] and and we had lived in Florida for 21
[59:51] years we had began to help brother
[59:54] Pinkston more in the ministry there I
[59:55] was more in Kansas it seemed like
[59:57] preaching than I was at home we had a
[59:59] desire in our hearts to move but really
[1:00:01] didn't have any unction to make it
[1:00:03] happen and so I'm down at Office Depot
[1:00:05] on January the 2nd of last year of
[1:00:08] actually 2011 which would be last year
[1:00:11] and I'm down there buying my yearly
[1:00:12] planning calendar because I sell life
[1:00:15] insurance and I keep a a desk calendar
[1:00:17] there on my desk and every day I write
[1:00:19] down what I should have done today and
[1:00:21] what I need to do tomorrow and and all
[1:00:23] those things as you should do have some
[1:00:24] kind of an organization to your life and
[1:00:27] I'm walking through Office Depot I've
[1:00:29] been renting a house from a man in
[1:00:30] Florida for 8 and 1/2 years and I'm
[1:00:33] walking through Office Depot with a
[1:00:34] calendar in my hand getting ready to
[1:00:36] plan out my year and my cell phone rings
[1:00:39] and my landlord says you know my
[1:00:41] daughter's got another baby now she's
[1:00:42] having a bigger family and I need you to
[1:00:44] move out of my house oh thank you after
[1:00:46] 8 and 1/2
[1:00:48] years of renting from this man we're
[1:00:50] friends we're buddies I'm just standing
[1:00:53] there with my calendar in my hand hand
[1:00:54] fixing to plan out my year and he says I
[1:00:57] need you to move out of the house I said
[1:00:59] wow Dennis how how much time have I got
[1:01:01] he said well you February 1st would be
[1:01:04] fine and this is January the
[1:01:07] 2 I put my yearly calendar back I got a
[1:01:11] monthly calendar because that was all I
[1:01:14] needed I didn't know on January 2nd I
[1:01:17] was going to be moving on February 1st
[1:01:19] right so then we're sitting there and
[1:01:21] then the choice has got to be made do we
[1:01:23] move into another house and just burn
[1:01:25] the road up between Kansas and home or
[1:01:26] do we move to Kansas and so now for a
[1:01:29] year I've been in Kansas if they put up
[1:01:30] with me one more month they've had me
[1:01:32] for a year now so that just shows we
[1:01:35] don't know what God has planned for us
[1:01:38] me walking through there I was thinking
[1:01:40] ahead I got to do this for my business I
[1:01:42] got to do that I got to keep paying the
[1:01:43] bills I got to work my rent up and then
[1:01:45] I didn't even need no more rent money in
[1:01:47] Florida that is
[1:01:50] so what timing did here I am and it was
[1:01:53] such a such a
[1:01:55] a sign to me here I am planning out my
[1:01:57] life with my very next year holding it
[1:02:00] in my hands fixing to go pay for it and
[1:02:03] just one phone call in your life has
[1:02:05] changed that's how we need to be
[1:02:07] brothers and sisters amen just just be
[1:02:10] pliable be be be bendable be moldable to
[1:02:14] whatever God would have for you right
[1:02:16] we've enjoyed our year out there the
[1:02:18] Saints are are are a blessing to be with
[1:02:20] if you ever get to travel and vacation
[1:02:22] we we we got to feed these guys while
[1:02:24] were out there we didn't we didn't get
[1:02:25] to sleep them we almost did but brother
[1:02:28] Chad stole brother Wade and and brother
[1:02:30] brother schroer took Brother Sam and and
[1:02:32] bunked them down but if you ever travel
[1:02:34] through we got we got our home open to
[1:02:36] you You' love our fellowship you love
[1:02:38] our the family there of the
[1:02:41] Lord but that's all I'm trying to say to
[1:02:43] you is as we go into 2012 if if a little
[1:02:47] blip a little something that's not the
[1:02:50] regular routine if we bypass the regular
[1:02:53] procedure maybe God is molding us a
[1:02:56] different way he's bending us a
[1:02:58] different way here Jesus is walking
[1:03:00] through the corn with the disciples and
[1:03:02] they're eating corn you can't tell me
[1:03:04] that he didn't know what the law said he
[1:03:06] was the one who wrote the
[1:03:08] law come on these guys weren't
[1:03:11] surprising him what are your disciples
[1:03:13] doing the law says it's not lawful for
[1:03:15] them the law says Jesus could have just
[1:03:18] throw back his chest and say I wrote the
[1:03:19] law why you telling me this but he said
[1:03:22] here's what the law really said that I
[1:03:25] am the lord of the Sabbath that the
[1:03:27] Sabbath was not made for church order
[1:03:29] but but the Sabbath was made for man and
[1:03:32] not man for the
[1:03:34] Sabbath the the son of man is Lord also
[1:03:37] of the Sabbath amen and you know what if
[1:03:40] you really want he says if you want to
[1:03:41] get really down to technicalities what
[1:03:43] about David yeah you know I shut him up
[1:03:46] you know go back go back to the source
[1:03:48] you you believe in David did you never
[1:03:50] read what he did
[1:03:52] yeah Church order vers bride order I
[1:03:55] believe brothers and sisters that we are
[1:03:56] entering into a bride order yeah I'm not
[1:03:59] going to say we're going to do
[1:04:00] everything perfect all the way through
[1:04:02] 2012 I'm not going to say we're not
[1:04:04] going to have a pothole in the road or a
[1:04:06] stump rise up in front of us isn't it
[1:04:08] amazing how them stumps can jump in our
[1:04:09] way sometime we're just driving down the
[1:04:12] road all a sudden there's a pothole
[1:04:13] there we don't know where it came from
[1:04:15] my wife can't miss any of them so I know
[1:04:16] they're all
[1:04:19] there
[1:04:21] there you man I'm glad I got some good
[1:04:23] Brothers here that'll agree with me on
[1:04:26] this I got the biggest amens out of my
[1:04:29] GPS sermon last night anything
[1:04:32] else I don't know why when she's driving
[1:04:35] my Buick she can't miss none of them no
[1:04:37] man I guess she just wants me to know
[1:04:39] the rose need repairing I don't know but
[1:04:42] it's not really that bad I hit one the
[1:04:43] other day and believe me I heard about
[1:04:45] it on the way here yeah let me not
[1:04:49] swerve quite far
[1:04:51] enough that's what legalism will do for
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:55] exactly she was preaching driveing
[1:04:58] order she had no Grace that's
[1:05:03] right bypassing the regular procedure
[1:05:06] here's what brother let me just read you
[1:05:07] a few quotes I am going to not use up
[1:05:09] much of your
[1:05:12] time he's what we were talking about
[1:05:14] last night he broke off the fish his
[1:05:16] fish growed out he broke off the bread
[1:05:18] every time he'd break it off another
[1:05:20] piece would grow on cooked fish already
[1:05:22] cooked fried and crisco ready to go
[1:05:24] ready grown what a person brother Rand
[1:05:26] says not break it off and raise up some
[1:05:28] wheat and go cook it and things like
[1:05:30] that he he says the regular procedure y
[1:05:34] he didn't do the regular procedure but
[1:05:36] he could bypass all of that right and he
[1:05:38] could just break off cook bread and hand
[1:05:40] it out to them with brown crust on it
[1:05:43] and said take it and eat it and you know
[1:05:45] there's such a lesson in that you know
[1:05:48] Jesus has got 5,000 men and all their
[1:05:50] women and their children sitting there
[1:05:51] waiting on food he could have spoke a
[1:05:54] mountain of bread into existence and fed
[1:05:57] them he could have spoke a mountain and
[1:05:59] they could have rushed it like a mad
[1:06:01] angry mob and gathered up all the food
[1:06:03] they wanted if he had chose to do it
[1:06:05] that way but he had a way that he wanted
[1:06:07] it to be done and it was that I will
[1:06:10] break the bread I will hand it to my
[1:06:12] Ministry and the ministry will then hand
[1:06:14] it to the people right I will break it
[1:06:18] the ministry will be handed every one of
[1:06:19] them's got a basket there's 12 12
[1:06:22] disciples there they all got basket
[1:06:24] right I'm going to break it off I'm
[1:06:26] going to give it to the disciples and
[1:06:27] the disciples are going to give it to
[1:06:29] the people come on brother can we go
[1:06:30] through the procedure again I'm going to
[1:06:32] break it give it to the ministry the
[1:06:34] ministry to the people I'm going to
[1:06:36] break it give it to the ministry the
[1:06:37] ministry to the people amen not the
[1:06:40] people get it for themselves right you
[1:06:43] do get it for yourself study at home
[1:06:46] learn at home read your books listen to
[1:06:49] those tapes amen but there's an Avenue
[1:06:51] that God has provided Peter and Andrew
[1:06:54] and Thomas and even Judas each one of
[1:06:56] those disciples had a basket one of them
[1:07:00] had fried one of them had boiled and one
[1:07:01] of them had babed but you take you
[1:07:03] wanted to eat from but there was
[1:07:06] something that that that God wanted us
[1:07:08] to understand the scripture says he
[1:07:10] broke it gave it to the disciples the
[1:07:12] disciples to the people and that pattern
[1:07:14] is still true today you are not going to
[1:07:17] go higher than your pastor the greatest
[1:07:20] mistake brother Rand let us know is when
[1:07:21] people want to go higher farther
[1:07:24] deeper y Lord help
[1:07:27] us but this is what brother random
[1:07:30] called the regular procedure he Bast all
[1:07:32] of that he just broke off cooked bread
[1:07:35] and handed it out to them amen with
[1:07:37] brown crust on it right in a message
[1:07:40] called at Thy word he's talking about
[1:07:41] the water he turned the water to wine
[1:07:43] now that water would have been wine
[1:07:45] someday perhaps but it'll have to go
[1:07:48] through the regular procedure of going
[1:07:50] up into the gra
[1:07:52] Vine coming out into of the grap being
[1:07:55] brought back and so forth like that but
[1:07:57] Jesus just bypassed all of that right
[1:08:00] because he was the god of nature right
[1:08:03] doesn't that ring true in our day that
[1:08:05] the god of nature was on the scene again
[1:08:08] Glory that the god of nature was on the
[1:08:10] scene you know there was a regular
[1:08:11] routine to get those squirrels on that
[1:08:13] limb there was a regular routine a
[1:08:15] couple of squirrels could have hooked up
[1:08:17] in the woods had baby squirrels of
[1:08:18] squirrels could have run out but there
[1:08:20] were no squirrels there right there was
[1:08:22] a regular proced that Abraham could have
[1:08:25] got a ram back in his day he could have
[1:08:26] went down to the farmer bought a ram
[1:08:28] offered the RAM on the sacrifice on top
[1:08:30] of the
[1:08:31] mountain but there was something
[1:08:33] Supernatural about this because when he
[1:08:35] had that dagger raised to to to slash
[1:08:38] the throat of his son he heard the ram
[1:08:39] hooked up in the wilderness over there
[1:08:41] right and you know the wonderful thing
[1:08:43] about it is Abraham didn't even have to
[1:08:44] chase the ram around he was tied up to
[1:08:47] the bush right I tell you brothers and
[1:08:50] sisters when God takes care of his
[1:08:52] people he takes care of his
[1:08:55] Abraham didn't get all worked up come
[1:08:56] here Ramy Ramy I need to have a
[1:08:58] sacrifice he's tied his horns are caught
[1:09:01] in the bush amen it's God providing the
[1:09:04] sacrifice I will provide I will be
[1:09:07] Jehovah gy
[1:09:10] amen that's why I get sideways with
[1:09:12] people they'll move 200 miles for a job
[1:09:15] M I got to feed my family and I believe
[1:09:18] God has given me this job and it's going
[1:09:19] to take me out of the church and I'll be
[1:09:21] 200 miles away but I believe that's the
[1:09:23] will of the Lord
[1:09:24] you need to think about that again why
[1:09:27] don't we find any people the way it was
[1:09:28] in brother Brandon's day moving to where
[1:09:30] the word was at right you know we fought
[1:09:34] all of them that wanted to move out to
[1:09:35] Arizona and brother brand tried to get
[1:09:37] them not to but I appreciated the fact
[1:09:39] that they even wanted to go right if he
[1:09:41] was if if you gave me a call and said
[1:09:43] brother R's preaching somewhere I tell
[1:09:45] you what I want to be in the meeting
[1:09:47] right I'm not going to just totally kick
[1:09:49] them to the curb because they were all
[1:09:50] trying to rush out to Arizona y I wasn't
[1:09:53] wasn't living back then I didn't have to
[1:09:55] make that choice but if brother BR said
[1:09:56] I'm going to be living in Arizona for a
[1:09:58] while I'd be packing up my car right but
[1:10:02] all we we we get sideways with all them
[1:10:04] folks that did that you know we do we
[1:10:06] well you know what's the matter brother
[1:10:08] stay where you are but here in our day
[1:10:10] we'll get people who say the lord gave
[1:10:12] me a job I need a better job it's 200
[1:10:13] miles away I ain't going to get to be in
[1:10:15] church I got to take my family out of
[1:10:16] church n and that's the will of the Lord
[1:10:19] that is not the will of the Lord I don't
[1:10:21] need to be spiritual or a prophet to
[1:10:23] tell you that the regular process would
[1:10:27] say yes that's a good job I need that
[1:10:29] job but I believe God can give you
[1:10:31] everything you need as you stay in
[1:10:33] Fellowship under the word as you stay in
[1:10:36] your home church as you support the
[1:10:39] assembly and as you are faithful to the
[1:10:41] post that God has called you to do we
[1:10:43] don't hear of anybody saying well I'm
[1:10:45] just going to quit my job and move 200
[1:10:46] miles so I can be in church no if we
[1:10:49] heard a guy testify that be like
[1:10:51] something wrong with that guy then quit
[1:10:52] his job since when did the job become
[1:10:55] more important than your spiritual life
[1:10:58] since when did your livelihood take
[1:10:59] preeminence over the serving the the
[1:11:02] true and Living Word that we have in our
[1:11:03] day it's because that's what leoa taught
[1:11:06] you to believe you got to go where the
[1:11:08] job is I believe God will bring the job
[1:11:10] to you you'll just sit still and believe
[1:11:13] and trust in him I've seen it happen I
[1:11:16] sold cars for a living I can relate to
[1:11:18] our brother's plight here selling cars
[1:11:21] i' I've stood in in a in a Ford
[1:11:23] dealership there in Florida when I first
[1:11:25] got there I ended up for most of my life
[1:11:28] selling GMS and Pontiacs and Buicks and
[1:11:30] praise the Lord for that I got away from
[1:11:31] those
[1:11:33] Fords but in the Ford
[1:11:37] store oh man I see that's medling Town
[1:11:40] take off the just a minute that's
[1:11:42] medling town right there but I was
[1:11:45] selling
[1:11:46] fors everybody say yeah I'll buy it and
[1:11:48] then you couldn't get a finance down at
[1:11:50] the Ford Store yeah I'll buy it we try
[1:11:52] to run the paper through and nobody got
[1:11:55] bought Buick and Cadillac store the
[1:11:57] folks come in they were a little more
[1:11:59] seem to be a little more better off I
[1:12:00] don't know why that is it just just
[1:12:02] lended itself to that but I've saw in my
[1:12:04] own life I stand there needing to feed
[1:12:06] my family got no groceries no no way to
[1:12:09] pay the bills 19 other salesman
[1:12:12] conglomerated smoking outside the door
[1:12:15] and I watch customers just weave their
[1:12:17] way right on through them and me sitting
[1:12:18] in my office moping and pouting yeah and
[1:12:21] coming in and say can you show me this
[1:12:23] car now here yeah it didn't didn't stand
[1:12:26] the reason they bypassed all the smokers
[1:12:28] and Drinkers and alcoholics and found
[1:12:31] me the day Jehovah of miracles on the
[1:12:35] scene amen and it would work out I don't
[1:12:38] know how it worked out but it just
[1:12:39] worked out because God will bring it to
[1:12:41] you brothers and sisters don't ever get
[1:12:44] in don't never let the dev tell that you
[1:12:46] got to go somewhere lead Church to make
[1:12:48] a living God will bring what you need to
[1:12:52] youen may not bring all everything you
[1:12:54] want to you bring what you need that's
[1:12:57] right yeah if we could ever get our
[1:12:59] wants hooked up with our needs we' be
[1:13:00] better
[1:13:01] off right bypassing the regular
[1:13:05] procedure Jesus just bypassed right all
[1:13:08] of that here in another message at that
[1:13:10] word brother R says this this is 1954
[1:13:13] same
[1:13:14] title just like at the beginning of his
[1:13:17] ministry he had went out and performed a
[1:13:18] miracle and turned water into wine
[1:13:21] brother BR says how I'd like to beat on
[1:13:23] that just for a minute to show what he
[1:13:26] will do in the resurrection right yep
[1:13:28] how many of you knew you could read the
[1:13:30] story about turning the water into the
[1:13:31] wine and you could find out how it's
[1:13:32] going to be in the resurrection right
[1:13:34] exactly how it eventually would have
[1:13:36] been wine it would have been wine all
[1:13:38] right and it went up through the vine
[1:13:39] and into the grape and out to the vat
[1:13:41] and it soured and fermented it come on
[1:13:43] out and was wine but he just bypassed
[1:13:45] every bit of that and he made it from
[1:13:48] Water to Wine s that's the way he will
[1:13:52] do in the res Resurrection right I won't
[1:13:55] have to live and be a 22 or 23 year old
[1:13:57] at my best again my being a be an old
[1:14:00] man shaken and broke down like that
[1:14:02] he'll just change it oh man I'll make
[1:14:05] everybody say Amen on brother he will
[1:14:08] just change it just bypass all that Mrs
[1:14:12] Brandon and Mr Brandon won't have to be
[1:14:14] constituted or anything involved in my
[1:14:16] birth he will just call me from the dust
[1:14:18] and I'll be just what I was at my best
[1:14:22] and so you amen I love the little poster
[1:14:26] the little artwork you've got downstairs
[1:14:28] there with those Saints pictures on
[1:14:29] there you know we ain't got to worry
[1:14:32] about knowing who they are when we get
[1:14:33] over there it's nice you got those
[1:14:34] pictures but brother BR says you're
[1:14:36] going to know who they are he say you're
[1:14:37] going to come up with your generation
[1:14:39] you know the one thing that there's not
[1:14:40] going to be in heaven
[1:14:42] introductions you're never going to have
[1:14:44] to hey who is that person over there
[1:14:46] you're going to know him brother Bren
[1:14:48] but I love that I love that little
[1:14:50] little little picture frame you got down
[1:14:52] there all those saints that have went on
[1:14:54] before that's right that's what brother
[1:14:56] Brown said he'll bypass all of that I'll
[1:14:58] be just what I was at my best Y and so
[1:15:01] will you that's it amen somebody say
[1:15:03] praise the Lord praise the Lord that's
[1:15:05] right I'm not at my best now right even
[1:15:09] at 19 I probably wasn't at my best I'll
[1:15:12] be honest you I don't think I've ever
[1:15:13] hit my best yet I I think the best is
[1:15:16] yet to come because I wasn't all that
[1:15:19] great at 19 or 20 or 21 whatever age you
[1:15:22] want to pick right I wasn't a real Prime
[1:15:24] candidate for for Resurrection then
[1:15:27] right but God's going to bring me back
[1:15:29] in the image that he saw me I'm just
[1:15:33] bypass and it is I be not afraid he was
[1:15:35] young he he's talking about John again
[1:15:38] John was saying I just can't understand
[1:15:40] how there was more baked bread if he
[1:15:43] would have had an oven and baked it and
[1:15:44] had the wheat and so forth I might have
[1:15:46] understood it but he didn't he bypassed
[1:15:48] the procession and the regular natural
[1:15:51] run of raising wheat and gring it and
[1:15:53] Milling it and sifting it and
[1:15:55] shortenings and salt and seasoning and
[1:15:57] putting it in the oven and but he just
[1:15:59] broke it and handed it out just broke it
[1:16:02] and handed it out that's
[1:16:04] right he bypassed all that it is it
[1:16:07] every time he broke a piece of bread off
[1:16:09] no sooner than his hand left there was
[1:16:11] another piece of bread
[1:16:13] am I want to ask you what kind of an
[1:16:15] atom did he turn loose not wheat but
[1:16:17] bread not wheat bread already baked it
[1:16:20] bypass the
[1:16:21] oven like he did his first miracle in
[1:16:23] can the water would have eventually
[1:16:25] become wine it went up through the vines
[1:16:26] into the grave crushed out become wine
[1:16:29] but he bypassed all of that right he was
[1:16:31] a Creator himself so in the great
[1:16:33] Resurrection he will bypass Papa and
[1:16:36] Mama and give birth to this he will
[1:16:39] speak and will'll come from the dust
[1:16:41] Glory like he did last amen that's what
[1:16:45] we're heading for Lord Amen brother
[1:16:47] random asked that question I didn't
[1:16:49] bring the quote but he asked that
[1:16:50] question he said How's God's going to
[1:16:51] find those those Gladiators and all
[1:16:54] those people that were eaten by the
[1:16:55] Lions those Christians that were fed to
[1:16:57] the Lions here they are scattered out
[1:16:59] over the face of the earth and the
[1:17:00] tongue of the lion how's God going to
[1:17:01] call that back but he said he will call
[1:17:04] it back he'll call and those Adams will
[1:17:07] reassemble themselves again and we'll we
[1:17:09] came from this Earth we went back to
[1:17:11] this earth and we'll be called forth out
[1:17:13] of this Earth again though the skin
[1:17:15] worms destroy this body and in my flesh
[1:17:17] shall I see that is exactly the truth he
[1:17:20] bypassed all the routines of nature he
[1:17:23] is God you fail to see who he is this is
[1:17:25] an unchangeable God he's the unchanging
[1:17:28] blood I've got I'm glad I've got faith
[1:17:30] in him tonight and someday when my life
[1:17:32] my body with it 16 elements will be back
[1:17:34] in the dust of the Earth right but he
[1:17:36] will say William brandom and I'll come
[1:17:38] forth he will breathe the breath of life
[1:17:41] into it and say there you are he'll
[1:17:43] bypass the birth through my mother and
[1:17:45] so forth at the resurrection he will not
[1:17:48] say Mr and Mrs brandom get married again
[1:17:50] and bring forth William but he will
[1:17:53] speak and I'll come forth amen that's
[1:17:56] him he's God Amen brothers and sisters
[1:17:59] this we say unto you by the word of the
[1:18:01] lord we which are alive and remain will
[1:18:03] not prevent or hinder them which are
[1:18:05] asleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:18:08] the moment in a
[1:18:09] twinkling somebody's going to be
[1:18:12] living I believe it 42 years ago when
[1:18:15] this message first came to me and I
[1:18:17] still believe it now those that have
[1:18:19] went on ahead of us they just given us
[1:18:21] something else to go and enjoy right
[1:18:23] brothers and sisters there's no
[1:18:25] discredit in death and there's no credit
[1:18:27] in living whether we live or die we need
[1:18:29] to be accepted of him is all that is
[1:18:31] matter this Resurrection is on its way
[1:18:34] it might be in
[1:18:36] 2012 I could have took a lot of time on
[1:18:39] the Mayan calendar for you this morning
[1:18:40] how many would rather had a sermon on
[1:18:42] the Mayan calendar I saw a good cartoon
[1:18:45] the other day just a few days ago while
[1:18:47] we've been on this trip two Mayans were
[1:18:49] standing there talking to each other one
[1:18:50] of them had his Mayan calendar all draw
[1:18:52] out
[1:18:53] and he said you know one of these days
[1:18:55] they're going to be disappointed to find
[1:18:56] out I just ran out of
[1:19:02] paper that's what the Mayans were really
[1:19:04] thinking when they wrote that they're
[1:19:06] going to be really disappointed to find
[1:19:08] out I just ran out of room at 2012 right
[1:19:12] we could discuss I saw a thing on the
[1:19:14] internet yesterday NASA has debunked the
[1:19:17] the 2012 Mayan calendar
[1:19:20] myth quit reading about the Mayan
[1:19:23] calendar we have got a better
[1:19:25] calendar we have got a word of the Lord
[1:19:28] that says it it's going to
[1:19:30] happen oh my believe it brothers and
[1:19:32] sisters we are in the change season I
[1:19:34] don't know what day it's going to happen
[1:19:37] you know brother Brandon we all want to
[1:19:38] go back let me grab a quote and I'll
[1:19:40] tell you how many there's going to be
[1:19:41] and when it's going to be y'all ever had
[1:19:43] any date Setters around here you
[1:19:46] remember the little purple book out of
[1:19:47] Jeffersonville you got to get old for
[1:19:49] this one now remember little by
[1:19:51] 1977 I me remember when that circulated
[1:19:54] through the message everybody had one we
[1:19:56] were reading them by
[1:19:57] 1977 it's because we just weren't in
[1:19:59] tune with what God was doing we were we
[1:20:02] were taking quotes and we were making
[1:20:03] them say something that maybe they
[1:20:06] weren't going to say but brother Bram
[1:20:07] knew exactly when it was going to be you
[1:20:09] I got the answer for you you want to
[1:20:10] know here here it is it's taking sides
[1:20:13] with
[1:20:14] Jesus we got to be looking for him right
[1:20:17] now we don't know it could be a hundred
[1:20:19] years from now yep how many remember
[1:20:21] this quote
[1:20:23] when is it going to be brother brand it
[1:20:24] could be a hundred years from now this
[1:20:26] was
[1:20:28] 1962 it could be 500
[1:20:31] years oh man we're getting disappointed
[1:20:33] now aren't we yeah A Thousand Years y
[1:20:37] 10,000 years I don't know y nobody knows
[1:20:41] but say for instance that we live each
[1:20:43] day that he was coming that day right if
[1:20:46] we live like he was coming this day when
[1:20:48] we awake if we sleep and we awake in the
[1:20:50] resurrection it will be just as fresh as
[1:20:53] if we had just fallen asleep and just
[1:20:56] woke up the trumpet sound the dead in
[1:20:58] Christ arise we which are alive and
[1:21:00] remain should caught up together with
[1:21:01] them to meet the Lord in the air so it
[1:21:03] will be just as fresh right but until
[1:21:07] that time until he comes we want to live
[1:21:09] each day like he might come the next
[1:21:12] minute because it might be the end of
[1:21:14] your life at that minute that's way too
[1:21:16] simple isn't it amen no I'd rather
[1:21:19] figure out what day it's going to be
[1:21:20] it's going to be October it's going to
[1:21:22] be this year it's going to be 84 it's
[1:21:24] going to be 89 it's going to be all the
[1:21:26] dates that we've had along the way but
[1:21:28] brother BR says I don't know and you
[1:21:30] don't know but here here's the remedy to
[1:21:32] fix it let's just live today like it
[1:21:35] could be today and if it is today we're
[1:21:37] not going to be surprised when it comes
[1:21:40] and if we go to sleep and we wake up
[1:21:41] we're going to be just like we're
[1:21:42] battling right on the W anyway it will
[1:21:46] be just as fresh that's one of the big
[1:21:48] questions when's it going to all end
[1:21:50] yeah you know I am a life insurance
[1:21:52] sales and I've done it for 20 something
[1:21:54] years now 1991 I got my license and you
[1:21:57] know what I did for all the Believers
[1:21:59] being a kind believer in this message if
[1:22:01] you buy a 20-year life insurance policy
[1:22:04] it's more expensive than a 10-year
[1:22:06] policy so back in the early 90s I told
[1:22:09] all my believer friends that were buying
[1:22:11] insurance from me I said just buy a
[1:22:13] 10-year plan it's cheaper and surely
[1:22:15] we're going to be gone by then
[1:22:19] yeah yeah see that's mixing business
[1:22:21] with the word ain't it
[1:22:23] I said surely we're going to be gone at
[1:22:24] the end of 10 years and you've been able
[1:22:26] to pay less this whole time and life is
[1:22:29] good and now they're all calling me my
[1:22:31] 10year plan is up right I've even got
[1:22:34] some now calling me saying my 20-year
[1:22:36] plan is up
[1:22:38] right yeah I don't know when it's going
[1:22:41] to be that's right but let's just live
[1:22:43] today like it could be today or tomorrow
[1:22:46] am Glory that's right the next big
[1:22:49] question we have in the message is how
[1:22:50] many is it going to be oh man that's
[1:22:52] that's a fun one cuz we can gather all
[1:22:55] the quotes and it looks like just so few
[1:22:57] and we think in that same message
[1:23:00] brother man we think about the coming of
[1:23:01] the Lord being a great thing the message
[1:23:04] remember there's a there is a
[1:23:06] predestinated group to be here when the
[1:23:09] Lord
[1:23:10] returns and it might not be over a dozen
[1:23:13] yep right see we don't know now remember
[1:23:17] he just said it might not be over a
[1:23:19] dozen see we don't know it might be aund
[1:23:22] million Y which way we going to take it
[1:23:26] a dozen that's quite a quite quite a gap
[1:23:29] ain't it right might not be a dozen
[1:23:31] might not be over a dozen it might be a
[1:23:33] 100 million might be
[1:23:35] 10,000 but if the predestinated will
[1:23:38] hear the message and believe it if it's
[1:23:40] God's if it's the message sin of God
[1:23:42] which we believe it to be the right
[1:23:45] number will be there that's I
[1:23:47] paraphrased that last part that's what
[1:23:49] brother random is telling us the right
[1:23:50] number right brothers and sisters we're
[1:23:53] not going to get down to the marriage
[1:23:55] supper of the lamb and find out that God
[1:23:57] didn't have enough chairs for us right
[1:23:59] right I am I just want to break that
[1:24:01] news to you now you know years ago I
[1:24:04] used to hear ddy Rambo sing that song
[1:24:06] Set another seat at the table because a
[1:24:08] child of God is coming home that song
[1:24:11] wasn't right at all now ddy Rambo I like
[1:24:14] some of her songs but that wasn't one of
[1:24:16] my favorites because I looked at the
[1:24:18] word and the word says if you are elect
[1:24:21] you got a chair for you
[1:24:23] exactly you're not going to get over
[1:24:24] there and find out somebody took your
[1:24:26] seat you're not going to get over there
[1:24:28] and find out that there was too many
[1:24:29] places and there's Empty Chairs there's
[1:24:32] there's if if God can look at Israel and
[1:24:34] say I'm going to get 144,000 of them
[1:24:37] then surely he can be numerically
[1:24:39] correct enough that when we get to the
[1:24:41] marriage supper of the Lamb we're all
[1:24:42] going to have a seat we're not going to
[1:24:44] have to push our brother aside so we can
[1:24:46] get in there that he has set just the
[1:24:49] right amount of places that God's not
[1:24:52] readjusting the dining hall when
[1:24:54] somebody else gets saved that's right he
[1:24:57] knows how many He Knows My Name
[1:25:00] brother oh aren't you glad for that this
[1:25:02] morning aren't you glad that the word is
[1:25:04] that true and real in your heart that
[1:25:07] you believe that when he does call you
[1:25:09] home there's a place for you I believe
[1:25:11] it let's stand to our feet if we
[1:25:13] can oh maybe our musicians will come
[1:25:16] we'll try to sing something for with you
