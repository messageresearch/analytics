TRANSCRIPT
========================================
number one good morning they look to God for the opportunity to be here again we're going to read this morning from psalm 42 and 43 you know how thinking we off to complain about the problems we got till we see somebody else's problem you know they said the man complaining because I didn't have no shoes till he's seen the man that had no feet his problem will not near as bad as he thought mr. pray Heavenly Father we are grateful this morning God just for this privilege an opportunity to come together to worship Lord we pray that your Holy Spirit has come in every heart father that we together Lord may by and Lord and draw you closer onto us Lord we ask as we read this scripture this morning but you were just revealed to our hearts Lord that would be meaningful to each of us Lord we ask you Father services there brother we would be bringing on to us God just touched you in a special way they'll be able to deliver his heart unto us God that we can receive that which he bring in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen some 42 as the hardpan is after the water Brooks so Paneth my soul after the Oh God my tears have been my me day and night while they continually say unto me where he is that God while thou cast down O my soul while thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet raise him for the help of his countenance deep calls unto deep at the noise of water spouts all the waves and our billows are gone over me I will say unto God my rock Wow has thou forgotten me why go I'm mourning because of the oppression of the enemy Wow thou cast down O my soul while thou disquieted within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my consciousness oh my god for thou art the god of my strength I do it thought yet why do thou cast me off why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy then will I go on to the altar of God under God my exceeding joy yet unto the harp will I praise the oh god my god why thou cast down O my soul and while thou disquieted within me hoping God for I shall yet praise Him who is there for my countenance amen joy unspeakable and full of glory wonderful day and good to see everybody house of the Lord you be seated for a second brother Ryan wants to kind of update us on where the little girl he is they've had to put her in to eccleston hospital so he can kind of upgraders and let us know do it and keep remember for sister Mary used to be Gabriel that your eyes are doing better so we appreciate that thank God for doing that first off I just want to thank everybody for their prayers for those who haven't heard maybe you became around midnight Wednesday night so thank you all and she got here everything normal and well with Gabe being the baby shortly after the delivery though they determined that her lungs weren't fully developed and she's slightly premature so they kept her in the NICU at Northeast Georgia now as of last night they said there's nothing else they can do for because you know she's just not improving with all their machines and things they've reached their limit so they sent her to eggleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta and there's a lot more that can do for their the outlook is really good and so I just want y'all to continue to remember her in prayer the reason I wanted to get up here and say this though is to show the devil that he's conquered because what I've seen throughout this I keep seeing the same thing daddy and I were talking on the way back from Northeast Georgia won one of the visits that we had with IVA and I said you know fear hath torment I told Gaby I said this is just torment it's tearing me to pieces inside I'm a human you know and so I thought of that scripture and I said Gaby we've got to have faith because faith is the counterpart to fear you know with faith we can you know God can work through faith but the devil works through fear and he holds us down with that so that was number one number two there was another instance where I'll just tore up last night the Bible study that's the first time I broke down during this because I had been looking at those machines in that room too much and looking at the circumstances and watching my baby curtain you know I gotta quit looking at the circumstances but so that's what was happening with me last night I began to worry too much and brother Wade said quit worrying and I believe that and I accept it that was number two of that same thing there's you know three is a witness the third one this morning about three o'clock in the morning at Egleston Children's Hospital i was doing my daily Bible reading just waiting on the doctor to come talk to us didn't go out of my way to find this scripture and I came across that very first fear hath torment number three okay three is a witness and that's the lesson I think God wants me to see out of this no matter what the outcome of this or any situation there's never a reason to worry you know you look back when have you ever looked back after a hard time a hard trial and said boy I'm glad I worried that really helped me a lot that's what got me through was all the worry no matter what there's never reason to fear so cast it down and that's that's really all the one to say just keep remembering Ava's she'll be fine where I stand together that have our brother back there with us and we always say yeah thank you for visitor come here one time your visitor two times you're part of us so just pray that the Lord would would bless you and be with you brother al said tell me yesterday that his mother came through the operation fine everything is great greater than what they even talked about it could be and she wound up with a little smaller spot that they thought they were gonna have to do a whole lot of work and you know it would be just it was just a small spot so you know just keep praying for her mr. Lord would be with it yeah we just done requested brother sister Mary the sister Mary dougherty is back in the hospital so remember her remember why she will be going the Lord willing and some time in August for her knee operation so we just keep praying that the Lord would bless and take care of everything you know doing that going because that's that's what we need right all hearts are clear we're ready to sister sister to see cutter hand yesterday and she didn't go to the doctor you know but wound up today having to go to the doctor with it so remember it's just a freitas sister remember that okay everybody ready to hear the word of the Lord no let's just sing open the eyes of my heart as brother William Moore Levon comes to speak the word of the Lord unto us don't we believe it right faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of the Lord Amen open the eyes of my and you seem to do an hour the eyes of my Amen god bless each and every one of you again it's so wonderful to be announce to the Lord this morning it's good to see everyone gonna fight y'all faces and like brother Dale said one time I guess second time family and I certainly feel that way I appreciate all that all the hospitality that I've shown and brother lay there and sister June and all of y'all we appreciate it so very much it's something because when he when he fellowship with a bride no matter where you go everybody's the same the true bride is the same no matter where you go because we all have the same father you know and I appreciate brother Ryan's testimony and his stand you know when our son Elijah was born he it was it was just a normal delivery and everything but I can kind understand what he's going through as far as because when he hit a trial the Satan will work on your emotions he'll work on your emotions and he'll use them emotions against you when our son was born my wife you know she got a little feverish they gave her medicine for the fever well then through the breast milk and somehow transfer to him and when he had a fever they started pumping with antibiotics and we ended up being in the hospital for several days you know got to put a little stint in his arm you know and it's hard it's hard and then you know when when the stuff like that happens it's just a normal trial and God is in control as our brother said he is in control and you know brother Graham said if I knew I was gonna die tomorrow morning what good would fear do fear has no virtue just like he said you know but he said faith can deliver me and God is in control and we appreciate that we appreciate that he knows all things and Satan cannot do nothing without God's allowance he couldn't even touch Joe without God allowing it so remember that all of our trials are for a reason we want to remember all these other requests because Satan is like a roaring lion but our God is in control because what when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against it and he'll be right there because it's not our battle it's his battle you know the key is to give our battle to him because he's the great general amen he's the great general we appreciated that Bible studies so much last night I mean how many - preciate of that you know we're talking last night about when God forgives he forgets and that's called justification you are justified before God himself so say and we'll use the five senses of our spirit like our memory and he'll bring that and use that against us but we have got to remember and remind him that we are forgiven and forgotten and only God can do that you know the Prophet himself he he you know he confessed he said you do some wrong against me I'll forgive you but I won't forget because we're human and when it happens it happens but he said only God can forgive and forget and that's most important thing is to be justified in eyes of God amen praise God we appreciate I appreciate every one of you my wife sends her greetings she really wanted to be here the little kid he's caught a little cold and it would've been a little hard on him and everything but she sends her greetings and wishes she was also here let's turn lets go to the Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 16 start verse one word of Lord says observe the month of Abib and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God for in the month of abiud the lower thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice to pass over unto the Lord thy God of the flock of the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there that's how he no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou mayst remember the day when now Came us forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of my life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coasts seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which they sacrificed at the first day at even remain all night until the morning thou may it's not sacrificed a passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even at the going down of the Sun at the at the going down of the Sun at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose and I shall turn in the morning and go into thy tents amen let's bow our heads before we see the DeMars gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful to you for your word with so thankful to you for your spirit we're so thankful to you for your mercy Lord and how mindful you are father Lord you said not a single sparrow falls without you knowing about it father and he said aren't you so much more than the sparrows father you know intimately what each and every one of us have need of this morning I pray O God that you helped me father just yield myself that you Father God with we may all be of service to you father we love you Lord we commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless you see you this morning I want to speak this morning with the help of the Lord on the revelation of the name of Jesus Christ and the importance of that name because as we read the text there several towns like two or three times God tells Moses that there's only one place where God will accept worship in the place where God chooses to put his name and we live in a day and in an age when anything goes there's no wrong as they say they don't want to be told no they don't want restrictions they call it you only live once and that's live the devil because there is that people like worldly people like the idea and the sinful nature of man likes the idea of living any way they want to and not having an answer for it they don't like the idea of responsibility they like the idea of living a sinful life being cremated scattered to the four winds of the earth and that's it that's that's what they think but it doesn't matter how many wins they're scattered to they will rise on the day of judgment and give a count for what they did so we live like I said in an age where people where anything goes and if you feel it do it that's a lie from the pits of hell because our first nature were born with we naturally do wrong do you know brother Branham say that Jesus was sinless by nature we're sinful by Nature no one has got to teach us to tell a lie no one has got to teach us to do wrong and no one had to teach Jesus to do right so the only way that we can become sinless is through Jesus Christ without that we're sin and we're sinners by Nature it doesn't matter if you're raised in the message in a godly home and you've never drank a drop of liquor in your life you're still a sinner the fact that you're born and coming to the world and breathe your first breath you're born and sin shaped in iniquity and you come to the world speaking lies and we need a Savior every single one of us so God has a certain requirement and he requires and he wants to be worshipped in a certain way and that is God's only provided way of worship you know they had these things that you see everywhere now these bumper stickers you might have seen them says coexist and each each each letter is made of a different religious symbol that's exactly what's happening they're wanting everyone to coexist but it's impossible it is impossible for everyone to co-exist like that so you have all these you know it's there's more find your path of enlightenment whatever makes you a better person that is what as long as we all get to one spot as long as you're a better neighbor it doesn't matter how you get there that's a lot that because see if say n can just muddle the waters he's got you people think that Satan don't want you going to church people when they are in church and in a religious form he's got you because when somebody's a sinner they can be under conviction and realize they're sinner but when someone is religious then it's hard Ram said that the religious spear is the hardest one to cast out a religious spirit because when someone is religious and has a religious spirit they think they're right and it can't be told otherwise unless God through God really has mercy on him so it's important that we have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ so god only accepts Jesus Christ he is the only he is the only accepted one so if we want to be accepted we've got to be in the accepted one so that is God's chosen place of worship we find in a very beginning in the book of Genesis we have a perfect example of Cain and Abel they both brought sacrifices and God accepted Abel's and refused Cain's now Cain didn't have a revelation like Abel did but God in His mercy even told Cain you do it as your brother and you'll be accepted God even broke it down to Cain on what to do and Cain came with God you accept it take it or leave it attitude and God left it God lets it so if we come with the attitude of Lord how do you want me to worship you where will I be accepted that God reveals it to you he will reveal to you his chosen place of worship because in the Bible there he says God says where I choose to put my name not where just where the name where you think the name should go he said where I choose to put my name because we find in the Old Testament every single feast day every single holiday absolutely everything pointed to Jesus Christ and He fulfilled every bit of it all the shadows all the types all the prophets were a part of Jesus and they were moved by the Holy Ghost to act in their lives and to do certain things by the Holy Ghost to reflect Jesus and they no doubt didn't necessarily know what they were doing but it was the Holy Ghost each prophet revealed apart each prophet revealed the lure part it was coming clear as it came on down closer to the manifestation of the Son of God it became clearer and clearer and clearer until there was God in flesh and he was absolutely everything that he that the Bible spoke of him you know last night in Bible study we're talking about when he when he beat all the money changers and things out of the temple you know even that the Old Testament prophesied that Mazda the seal of my house has eaten me up so he had to fulfill the scripture even down to the absolute letter he had to fulfill the scripture he had to die before they can go break his bones because that was the natural practice was to break the bones that the legs that would be the final thing but he had to die before that because that's what the scripture said and not one scripture can be broken so we find through the process of time throughout the Old Testament as he would lay his word down and he was coming and constantly just given a little shadow of what it was to come he was revealing himself in part when Jacob he wrestled with Almighty God and he asked the angel which was God himself in flesh a man he asked the angel what his name was but it wasn't ready to give that name yes he said why do you want to know my name Moses at the burning bush he came and he met with God himself and he asked him he said when they when I go into Egypt and try and deliver and they're gonna ask me who sent you who well what do I say he said tell them that I am that I am sent you I am that I am and we know that was Jesus Christ but that wasn't the name of God I am right it was a brother man talks about the unveiling of God how God changed his form because Jesus when he came he said before Abraham was I am in the book of Hebrews you have Paul talking about Moses and he said that Moses esteemed the riches of Christ more than the treasures of Egypt so Moute so Paul had the revelation that the burning bush was Jesus because Paul said that Moses esteemed the riches of Christ more than those of Egypt and Moses met God in the form of I am but it was still giving a little more part out he was given a little more part out and the message God's chosen place of worship brother Branham said here now in he what is his name first we'll have to name find what God's name is before we can find what it is he's putting in the place now we find out that he had many titles he is called the he was called father which is a title he's called son which is a title he's called the Holy Ghost which is a title he was called Rosa Sharron which is a title lily-of-the-valley a title Morningstar Jehovah Jireh Jehovah a57 compound different compound redemptive names all of them were titles none of them were names we're talking about where God chooses to put his name that is his accepted and provided way of worship he said but he has a name when he met Moses he had not a name yet he told Moses I am that I am and we see Jesus and when we see Jesus on earth speaking in Hebrews the sixth chapter I beg your pardon Saint John the six he said I am that I am they said why you're not a man over 50 years old and say that you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am and I am was the one the burning bush the pillar of fire that was in the burning bush back in the days of Moses the I am the I am when he would meet with the prophets he'd say I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob now Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the flesh died hundreds of years ago but he the Bible also said that he's not a God of the of the dead he's a God of the living when he said I am that's present tense because God changes his form he was God above us in the pillar of fire he was God with us in his son Jesus Christ and now he's got in us he brings it more personal you remember brother Branham talked about that he loved his wife so much he said sometimes I wish I could just pull her inside of me but he can't do that but God loved us so much that he wanted to live in us not with us wasn't good enough he wanted to live in us and lead us and guide us into all truth only God can come down and live in someone else we can't do it we cannot do it but God condescended himself because Christ is the mystery of God revealed all the mattre buttes all all the love that was then God from the beginning he poured into Christ Jesus Christ was an absolute expression of what God was when he'd seen Jesus walking you seen God walking but you didn't know it unless God revealed it to you so remember Jesus was God's chosen place of worship you know we find that even and it was Gideon when he was there and God was coming down and he was calling him and then an angel came forth and he told him down mighty man of Valor and Gideon said if God be witness and where's all the miracles so you see God seen a mighty man of Valor Gideon said all these Philistines around us where's the mighty man of what you know if God be with us where's all the miracles but God said you know be a good courage thou mighty man of Valor and an angel of God brother M said it was God in flesh again came to him and Gideon also wanted to know his name but he didn't tell him he didn't tell him his name because it wasn't the time for that manifestation yet because God was still dealing in parts he was still letting out a little bit letting out a little bit making himself known because remember everything as it was everything was coming in part and Jesus Christ was the capstone of the whole thing he was he was the very embodiment of God himself and spiritually I want to think spiritually this morning that all the church ages had a word in part but when the fullness comes is Jesus Christ made manifest again the same thing because you see that the ephesian church age would brother Graham said was a Garden of Eden all over again you see the Garden of Eden started Eve compromised on the word come out to the process of time God capped off in Jesus Christ there was a fullness ephesian church age all over again they started compromising on the word they left their first love of the word they came on up and there it is again in his fullness Christ in the bride oneness brother Graham said also in God's chosen place of worship he said now we find out that Jesus said also I come and my father's name and he received me not then the name of the Father must be Jesus that's right the name of the father's Jesus because jesus said so I carry my father's name I come in my father's name and he received me not then his name was Jesus and Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called his name Emmanuel which is God with us then God was manifested in the flesh in order to take away the sin of the world and in doing so he was given the name of Jesus so Jesus is the name and the name was placed in a man not a church not a denomination not a Creed but a man he chose to place his name in Jesus Christ now we find out then that he becomes God's place of worship where you worship Him ever before he was born his name was called Jesus it was so important it was gift to his mother by the angel Gabriel that his name would be called Jesus the Son of God what he was so after this time now it's time for God to fully reveal his name in Jesus Christ and this message if you get anything out of the message as a whole other than Jesus Christ you've missed it because this message points you to Jesus Christ this message is Jesus Christ and I pray that God will in your in your soul so fabricate the Bible and the message together that it will even together can never be separated because then intellectualism and reasoning will have no place because you can't you know like I said the message is a manifestation of the Bible so God must be worshiped in the right way it's not a set of rules it's not theology it's not a rules of do's and dont's is get to Jesus and he takes care of everything else and Jesus is the word so when Jesus when God was manifested in Jesus Christ the priests are still trying to worship Him according to the law of Moses and that was sin because Jesus God's chose the place of worship was right there in Palestine and Nazareth going around that was God's chosen place of worship so we must know and understand where God's chose a place of worship is it's always in Jesus but remember that Jesus is the word and God's chosen place of worship was to be in that Ark at one time and Noah's Ark you had to be there to be saved that was so to speak that was God's chosen place of safety of worship but the Ark is in Jesus Christ the art is a type of Jesus Christ so when the fulfillment of that shadow cane that was God's chosen place of worship so it didn't really change and what it was it just changed in the dispensation because there's a word allotted for each and every age that God allots and that's where God shows a place of worship is because we want to find out what Jesus is doing right now we don't want a God of history we want to lift him up out of history because in any church anyone that claims to serve God that packs a Bible can say that Jesus raised from the dead but they think of him as a historical sense we know Jesus Christ have now that heals the babies that heals that heals the young heals the old that's the God that we know now we appreciate what God did but what's he doing what is he up to we need to have a personal relationship with him so God must be worshiped in the right way you all know the story of this hair Phoenician woman when she came to Jesus there was a woman in the Bible she was a Gentile and Jesus was sitting there at the table and she approaches Jesus because she needs something her daughter needed some help and she approached Jesus and she said thou son of David have mercy my daughter she's grievously vexed with the devil and do you know what Jesus said to her the God the giver of every good thing the Prince of Peace the God of all love he said it's not meat for me to take the bread and give it to the dogs but then look what she did she didn't go off and run off and just you know and blaspheme she said it's true Lord but the dogs eat the crumbs that are swept from the Masters table and then when she approached him in the right way she got what she wanted because it's important to know that he was son of David to the Jews but not to the Gentiles so to try and approach Jesus the Sarah Phoenician woman as the son of David did not work because he was to the Jews the son of David blind bartimaeus he was blind and he's seen him going and he said thou son of David have mercy on me and that pulled that faith Jesus had no way of hearing him through the crowd all the uproar but Jesus felt the faith that he had in his heart and he pulled he touched the he touched the hem of His garment by faith he pulled on that gift in God and Jesus around and he said what will you do that you know what is it that you would that I do for you he said that I may receive my sight and he got his sight he said son of David but that but the Seraphin asian woman had to had to approach him in the right way he comes as in three ways and as the son of man son of God and Son of David son of man was when he was made manifest in flesh in Jesus Christ he was the son of man he kept saying the son of man must do this that you know the I the son of man who do you say that I the Son of Man am then he they killed the son of man because God cannot be killed and God is a spirit so he had to be manifested in the flesh to be crucified so he can suffer for us so after they crucified the Son of man he died he was buried and he raised again and he came in the office of the son of God and he became the Holy Ghost because remember in the beginning God was the pillar of fire in the Old Testament and all he did was he changed his mask all he did was he changed his form into something else the same God that was with Abraham that met him under the oak tree and discerned the thoughts of Sarah's hearts was the same God that was a pillar of fire it was the same God that came in Jesus Christ all he did was he changed his form you know brother when he talks about like the drama you know I'm not old enough to be a grandfather yet but all of you brothers that are for example or sisters for grandmother brother Dale here he's a grandfather he's a father and his son he's all three you know but but but his sister there doesn't have claims on him that's her husband but that's not her father but brother Dale is the same man so you see how all he does is whenever his grandkids come and he's happy to see him and he goes fishing with them he steps into the role of grandfather but he's still father whenever brother weight comes that's his son but it's still the same in he just changes his role but it's all the time brother Dale is still Jesus Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus of the new right so that is why and it's amazing because the doctrine of the Godhead is fought so hard against and as we come along I pray that the Lord will just quicken to where you understand why it's all about the name because God's chosen place of worship is where he puts the name so if Satan can deceive the world and to believe in that each three he's got him it doesn't matter how many churches they build he's got him because Father Son and Holy Ghost earn our names so we find that he's son of man when he became manifested he's son of God throughout the church ages as the Holy Ghost and he's going to be son of David in the Millennium amen there's a little secret that comes in there Luke seventeen thirty even thus shall a be and the coming of when the Son of Man is revealed again it's just a secret let's go to the unveiling of God remember because if you're still trying to worship Him as son of God as a God of what he did back in Luther's day you missed it he sent up man again and the unveiling of God we'll start with 68 notice now he came first as prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God God is a spirit he was the holy spirit son of God he lived through the church ages as son of God now in the Millenium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David now he says and it says and remember between the son of God in the latest year church age they put him out and in Luke that's Luke 1730 he said he would be revealed again as the son of man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it see the Scriptures tied together perfectly son of man son of God son of David what was it it was the same God all the time just changing his form in Marfa just change it it's a great drama to him he's acting it out because I said in each church age he's got a word that is allotted for each generation to keep the elect peer then he said for his acts he changes his form then he came the form of the Son of Man for the reformers age Wesley Luther and all down through then we find out that they got it so bundled up just like the Israelites did - when he does appear in the last days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy Spirit they reject it they did the same thing Israel did so what does he do now return a son of men and then from that son of David he said see how close we are and I want to point out something very interesting is that when Jesus came manifested as a first as the son of man the first time they crucified the Son of Man we're at the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ again in the office of the son of man because history repeats itself it's the same spirits history repeats itself so he is now revealing himself in the form of the Son of Man in the flesh of his bride amen and the flesh of his bride doing the exact same works doing the exact same things God promised he would do it God promised he would do it because in the Old Testament God was always veiled he was always hidden brother Graham said when the pillar fire went behind that veil and the Old Testament it wasn't seen again until on the road to Damascus when it struck Paul Saul who was then sawed off his horse so once the pillar fire went behind the veil of old badger skins it still took faith to believe that he was still there because of God because God requires faith no matter what age you live in you find in the Old Testament I was behind the veil of badger skins he was surrounded by 12 tribes of Israel right there were three on each side in every direction we find that that same pillar fire comes tabernacled in flesh in Jesus Christ and he's surrounded by twelve disciples because God guards his word and I hope this doesn't stumble you but God that holy place is only for the bride it's only for the bride because God is not just gonna just gonna give his word out and just have it miss handling everything that's what happened through the church ages but if brother Ram talks about how the Gospels how each one is a cherubim amen you got Matthew Mark Luke and John how ones one's a lion ones one's a man an ox and John's the eagle and he said that the Gospels guard the book of Acts the vegard because in Matthew how many multitudes of people this morning are preaching baptism in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost because of what Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 but brother Graham said that is guarding the truth of acts 2:38 because the elect can enter in there God has always failed the Word of God has always failed so we have to know how to approach Jesus Christ it's not complicated because it's not a set of rules it's not something you've got to know you get to Jesus and he will lead you and guide you into all truth it's not learning it's not it should not be overwhelming it's get to Jesus and he will lead you and guide you into all truth that's what it's all about you get to God because he is the word and he will reveal because if God will not reveal himself to you in the form of a word that's already gone by the Holy Ghost will not lead you and guide you and to Luther's truth he will lead you and guide you into the message of the day that's what he will lead you and guide you in because it's all truth let's go to st. John 17 I pray you have established in your hearts God's chosen place of worship brother and preached a lot on that you've got to come to God's provided place of worship his chosen place of worship st. John 17 these words spake Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou had sent that's life eternal is to know Jesus I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was before we go on let me remind you that remember the name of God is also the word of God because Jesus Christ is a manifestation of the word he said I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world then they were and now gave us them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine he's praying for us here in st. John 17 he's not praying for the Pharisees because he manifested God's name to them and they crucified Him but he's manifested his name to the elect and over here in verse 6 he said and they have kept thy word this is right before he goes to the crucifixion this is right before he gets to the Garden of Gethsemane he's praying for us that's how you have to look at it he is praying for you right there in st. John 17 he's praying for the elect that when the name of God is manifested the elect believe it that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost receiving the word for your day which is Jesus Christ not given this to someone and they take it and intellectually believe God sent a prophet but when it becomes a part of them when it's alive in them when it is in the very soul because we're coming to a very tricky hour in Matthew 24:24 Jesus said it be it be so closely to see the very elected impossible Pentecostal denomination can't deceive the elective and couldn't for years and years but it's right there right around the bride that's what Judas was Judas was not a Pharisee Judas was right next to Jesus the entire time the entire time and when did he make himself known right before the crucifixion he showed his colors riots time the crucifixion right then so we know that there's got to be a bonding of that Jesus said by the tears first they have to be bound first they're being bound now then that wheats to be taken to the garner just that thrashin time because remember everything that can be taken will be shaken to the very core that is why intellectual belief in this message will not hold that is why I'm saying you've got to weave such a revelation between the Bible and the message you can never be shaken Jesus say that I'll build my church upon this rock Peter didn't say I believe Lord that you're Noah he said others were believing in today you were Jeremiah and some were saying you were Isaiah and some were saying this that's what they were believing but Peter believed he was Jesus Christ the Son of God Jesus I mean brother Peter had a present-tense faith he understood exactly what day he was living in he knew exactly he recognized God's presence he recognized the message of his hour but you know it still took a Holy Ghost baptism because after when Jesus was led over there to be judged he denied Jesus so people can have now I believe Peter had a revelation but it had he still had to be feel what the Holy Ghost you can say well bless God I know I realize brother Graham is a prophet that's good but you're not there yet you've got to take it on to the Holy Ghost and then you'll know that Jesus Christ raised from the dead you'll know that you know the Bible says that no man can call Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost up until then it's an intellectual conception up until then you're believing unto it and you believe it you've been taught you read it and you're trying to apply your faith but when you become indwelt then you're a witness of it you're a witness that when you're in dwelled and you say I know he raised from the dead before it I believe he raised from the dead right I believe I'm believing because Jesus told Peter said when you are converted strengthen your brethren right brother I said that before you get the Holy Ghost you're not even converted you're just believing into it you're in you're on the way that's wonderful because you've got to be justified before you can be sanctified you've got to be sanctified before you can be filled with the Holy Ghost it's a process and you know even being born again as your baby you still grow there's still a lot of mercy on our lives when when you're born again when a baby is born there's no denying that the baby has life right the baby is alive it's breathing but it still Falls it still bumps its knees so don't beat yourself up over your mistakes because we still fall and as long as we're in these bodies we will always fall within ourselves but the important thing is to get up and not stay down when you make a mistake you quickly repent I'm sorry Lord I didn't mean to do that and there's not a single one of us that doesn't have to repent every day if the Prophet said he backs sides every day we backslide every day and he you know he people would mistake him for God he had that much of the presence of the Holy Ghost in his life and he said I backslide every day so don't think that you're the only one that makes mistakes don't think you're the only one that ever gets a wrong idea a wrong perception because the greatest matter that ever thought is in the mind because in the beginning the Prophet tells us that God chose a man's heart and Satan chose a man's mind that's where the battle happens where the RAM said you can't help crows flying over your your farm the farmer can't help that he said don't let him roost and that's where the problem is you know I mean if the crows fly they fly you dismiss it you repent but don't let them roost because when they roost what happens they lay eggs and you've got more crows than ever and it just multiplies it just multiplies amen so we have to remember Jesus was the only one that sinless by nature not a single one of us or because Jesus is never God don't send anyone to hell for being a sinner because you can't help being a sinner that's how he came to the world he sends people to hell well he don't send it people send themselves to hell by refusing the atonement by refusing the others think brother Brennan said that a person fights their way to hell because hell wasn't created for human beings it was created for the devil and his angels and he knows that's way he's going Satan does he knows he's got a short time so he's fighting harder than he ever has the devil knows where he's going what we need to do is remind him where he's going because the only thing that reasons against the word because you know a lot of times people can get conceptions in their mind and think they're thinking something when it's really the enemy here's a good way to think to discern and God give us all the wisdom to discern when it's the enemy because when he comes against the word and the promise of the hour it's the devil when he's trying to put fear in your heart it's the devil when he's trying to put doubt in your heart it's the devil because God is not an author of confusion he's not the author of fear he's the author of love and peace amen he's not an author of confusion so whenever something comes on to you or something comes honor that they get scared and and like I was saying earlier you know there will be a trial and Satan will use that trial and use your emotions against you I always use the emotions against you let's go on in Saint John 17 it's talking about keeping us in their name verse 7 now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for I have given unto them the words that thou gave us me and have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that's how to send me I pray for them I pray not for the worlds but I pray for them which thou has given me see it's not for the world for they are thine and all are thine and thine are mind and I'm glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are that was God's that was Jesus's prayer that was his intention is that we may be one with him as Jesus and the father are one oneness while I was with them in the world I kept them in their name those that I has given me I kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the Scriptures might be fulfilled so we'll stop there now see how many times Jesus keeps repeating that he has manifested their name he has manifested the name of God keep through thy name it's the name it's the name and that's what Satan always attacks is that name of Jesus Christ because Jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils and my name they shall heal the sick we're supposed to be baptized in his name live in his name be buried in his name everything in the name of Jesus Christ he said the Bible says whatever you do in word or deed be it all in the name of Jesus Christ everything is to be done in his name brother Graham said if you can't say something and this this preaches all of us you know don't think that when a preacher preaches he and preaching to himself - if it's true preaching he's preaching to himself hey man but he said don't say nothing unless you can say it in Jesus name don't do nothing except you can do it in Jesus name if you can't do it in Jesus name then don't do it if you can't think it and Jesus name then don't do it because remember he said that our thoughts are speaking heaven right right they're louder in heaven than our words are on earth our thoughts are right so we got to think in Jesus name and remember we still have the crows brother I said you blast them with the shotgun with the word that's what you blast them with get thee behind me Satan amen get thee behind me Satan in the name of Jesus Christ you rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus Christ he said rebuke he said that he's talking about the devil and he said that you know rebuke him and he'll flee from you resist the devil and he will flee from you resist doesn't necessarily mean it's just a one-time attack resist means it's repetitive and you know Paul you know you see him in the Bible and you see how the great revelation that God had given Paul to be able to separate law from grace and to be able to preach Jesus Christ out of the gist the Old Testament he laid it all out yet God allowed an evil spirit to constantly buffett Paul so that he won't be exalted above the revelation brother branham had trials and I remember him saying about you know he was talking about how he how he's got to wait on the Lord you know he said people come to him and God gives me a vision and I tell them what to do by the Holy Ghost and they go do he said but I've got to sit there and wait he said he's got to sit there and wait so the name of God is Jesus Christ and it's the Word of God and when you see Jesus and when you think of Jesus everything that God was he poured into Christ and that is a very nature of God and your name and the names have a lot to do with the characteristic of something that is why God is in the business of changing names you know there's so many example in the Bible with Jacob and before he rests with the angel he was Jacob which ments the planner and afterwards he became Israel prints with God you know Saul was changed to Paul and many others God will change the name because it represents the character then acts 4:10 he said be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him to this man stand here before you hold this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there's not none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved it's only in the name of Jesus Christ the prophet of God said if somebody's baptised in titles of father son Holy Ghost they're baptized into the Catholic Church so think of all these Protestant daughters that baptize entitles and they don't know what they're baptized right to the Catholic Church they don't realize it so the name God put his name where he wants to be worshipped so we've got to find out the name of Jesus Christ where is it how do we approach God you know in the revelation or the amount of word given for each age has to do with how much was let out because Wesley had a little more revelation than Luther did it was still the same thing whenever you plant a grain or a crop of corn you plant that corn seed in the ground but you don't know what the seed look like unless you're the one that planted it until it comes to fruition and when that corner or that wheat comes up to the top then you say that is what's in there in the ground so that's how the Word of God is because jesus said except a corn of wheat fall on the ground at abideth alone so put it in the ground it grew throughout the process of time church ages are simply a timeline they're a Gentile dispensation timeline that God deals with the Gentiles when you hear me refer to church ages God allows a lot is so much word as he was coming on up and there was a man of God who caught the word of the hour and he kept the elec clean for that age and they believed the word and they were saved by it that's what they would see the Holy Ghost by by receiving that word now these seven church ages which he can find we'll get there in a minute we can go internal they're revelations too I'll read it in a few minutes but there were seven churches and we were talking about names about how the reflects character and these seven churches were literal geographical churches that were scattered throughout Asia Minor and the Mary's but yet their names prophesied an age they prophesied a character of that age like Ephesus was a First Church age and that name means relaxed that's what the church meant that's what the name meant was relaxed and we find that in the church ages they got relaxed about the word semana means bitter Pergamos you can go and pull up that chart brother Joe just so they can follow along for those that aren't too familiar with it some Myrna Ephesus means relaxed see these are seven church ages those were the messengers that God sent to each and every age those were the ones that had the word for their day there are the ones that caught those were one of the Angels the Stars and Jesus his right hand there's seven of them amen and this is just the light that each age was given and God allotted to each age just like he did in the Old Testament you know like he had a know wall then he had a Moses and he's bringing it on down he had an allotment and then at the end is Jesus Christ made flesh God made flesh so emphasis means relaxed semana means bitter Pergamos means married and that is where the church and the state United they married tight IRA means dominating female that's when the Catholic Church had the Dark Ages Sardis means the escaped ones Luther called them out and they escaped Philadelphia means love of the Brethren and Lady of SIA means people's rights and we know that so true ain't it people's rights you see so much happened you know the voting of women and just civil rights and just rights rights rights that's what it's all about but you know what sheep gives up their right he just the she just lets the master just shear all that wool off you know the sheep is not does not manufacture that wool it bears it naturally from the inside out so we're not to manufacture the Holy Ghost because if somebody you know sticks peacock feathers and tries to make themselves a peacock or eagle feathers when they're crow eventually them feathers may be fresh for a while and they'll wither up and fall off because they're not genuine so let's go to revelations 2 and see what God did with the name revelations 2 we'll just read verse 3 he this is the first church age will start verse 1 unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil thou has tribe in which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted so see they had the revelation the word started fresh in the Church of the Ephesians right they had the word they had the power they had the works and it was coming on down and then in verse 13 I want us to watch in verse 13 this is the Pergamos this is the third age I know that works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and that's not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr which was slain among you where Satan dwelleth okay now that was the first three in the fourth Church age I want us to watch because there's no name mentioned in the fourth church age in the dark age in the Church of Thyatira you can read on that when you go home as no name mentioned and in chapter 3 of Revelations will start verse 1 and unto the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works and that thou hast a name that thou livest and our dead so we see brother Joe if you can pull up the church age chart they're the first church age had the name the second church H had a name and per the moats are still holding on to that name they held faster the name if I Tyra it disappears and Stardust they come out on the other side with a name that they live but they're actually dead and remember luther baptized in titles before they had Jesus name baptism then they lost the revelation of the name in Thyatira they come out on the other side and start us with the name that they live but they're dead so they lost the revelation of the name so that means God had a restoration to do he had to bring it back because there's power in the name of Jesus and Satan knows that so he can pull the wool over people's eyes he's got him but there's a restoration promised you can keep that up brother John I'm just gonna read a verse here in the Philadelphia NH and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth the no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name at the age of the open door brother and said that was in the Philadelphia Church H and he said that Philadelphia in church age overlaps he said the church ages weren't you know an abrupt start and an abrupt stop there was an overlap especially lady of seeing because in that Philadelphia Church age was a big missionary agent means brotherly love or love of the Brethren so there was a big missionary effort to spread the gospel so wasn't overlapping but jesus promised that he was set before us an open door and Jesus is the door and of course in the next one we find Jesus knocking he got kicked out in the message Ephesian Church age you can keep that chart up so I can just point to it now the first round the Apostles now we see this in the beginning Pentecost he's walking around the same great God the same great signs we're to take place all down through these ages because he walked among kids at each age blessing what his people that's assembled in his name I want you to watch this as we go through the church this church had Jesus name this church had Jesus name this church had Jesus name he said and this church lost it this church come out the Sardis this church come out of the Lutheran age with the name that you live but you're dead he said and goes right on down to the end of this age the Philadelphian in between this age of philadelphia and the lady of sia this age there's an open door set that brings back that name again to the church he said now watch and see if that is the truth after we get it here to the scriptures between the two ages so they kept the name then they lost it and that was a dark age because there's power in the name of Jesus and they lost the revelation of the name of who he was he said now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door to the Sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that revelation is opening up to bring a strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ bloomed out before us because God had a prophet on earth to reveal the true baptism to reveal the true name of Jesus Christ because real Ram says here what is that but a revelation of him that is what the revelation that is what the open door is it opens Jesus is the door and he opens the word amen he said yes we knew that he was God how else could he be our Savior but to know that he was only God or God alone and that he was the Alpha and the Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him the Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and Holy Ghost all one person that had been lost since the first ages but now we are seeing it again that's why God needed to send a prophet to restore everything that was lost to restore the name that was lost at the beginning of the ages it got lost I got motored up so God had us in a prophet to say this is what it is he said the revelation of who he was had come back indeed Godhead is not a three-person God with one personality for it takes personality to make a person and you'll see that if you go like two denominational Church websites when they have their statement of faith they'll say we believe you know in one God with three personalities and that's what he's saying here it's not possible to have a personality without being a person but they who believe in three persons have a three god Godhead in our guilty of breaking the first commandment that's why God had it to restore that's why God had to restore because the name was been lost and when that name comes back and that power comes back into the church brother Ram said he said you ought to see then he talks about was an Israel in the church here it is he says and I believe we're on the borderland tonight I was wondering about all these meetings all my meetings and things how I had to cancel him he said I truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have rapturing faith he said we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone rapture in faith he said got to have a faith that are changed and quickened this body and be taken away he said I believe there's a church on his Road tonight a power of the Living God that man will speak the word here and there little flash like lightning amen I believe that with all my heart you say well where is it brother Ram said that it's not so perfect now I said wait to them World Council of Churches get together and start persecuting the bride then it'll start because we're in dude with power really Jesus has the power and he's giving us the authority but when it's necessary to use he'll use it you know brother Joe gave me a quote about Joshua and what the prophets said about how he made the shadow of the son you know stay on the earth and that's how he was able to carry God's plan Joshua did not premeditate that he was in the line of duty fulfilling the word he said son stand still I need more time before they regroup before they they're all routed now I need more time to fulfill your word so if there comes a time and I believe there will be to where we need that quickening power it's there it's like a lion waiting to come out of a cage and as soon as that cage comes out there she comes there he comes because God has all power but we can't say things within ourself when brother bran was on the platform that maniac who ran in remember to try and kill him he said The ministers scattered off the platform he said I would have to but he felt that presence and then God took control he didn't pretty Maritain say you know he wouldn't do nothing without a vision because he's like Jesus you know when Elijah when he was over there on Mount Carmel he said as thou has showed me God had already showed to Elijah what was gonna happen we can't presume in Finch without authority but when it's God Almighty speaking it it's gonna come to pass because brother Graham said that when we put the Word of God upon our lips he said it's the same idea T speaking cuz that's how the bride is able to prophesy because she gets the word in her she eats the book you know brother Branham said that a seal is the sign of ownership and a mark is it's not a distinction when God mark Cain he was separated but we are sealed by the Holy Ghost to the day of redemption and God you know then seven seals God had in the back part of his mind they were his he owned him amen and he gave him to the bride he gave it to the Prophet who gave it to the bride Jesus Christ Himself descended from heaven and John who represents you and me when took the book out of Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ he owned him he loosed him and gave him to the bride and now the question is what are we doing with it are we eating it that's what we've got to put ourselves on the spot are we eating the book because revelations 10 once the seven is wonderful when it happened but now revelations 10 8 to 11 got to happen we've got to eat the book you are what you eat as the saying goes right so you feed on the wrong things you'll produce the wrong things you eat the right thing you'll produced you I promise you this you eat this and it'll produce the rapture you eat this and it'll produce a body change because that's what this word was sent for us to quicken the endtime elect to let us know what day and hour we're living in let's move on he's talking about the name how that open door was set that open door was set to restore a name and when that revelation is brought it brings about a name change it brings about a name change because with the name change comes the nature change when Saul became Paul he was no longer saw when Jacob became Israel he was no longer as a planner he was a prince with God so we see that Abram Abraham used to be Abram but God changed his name Sarah used to be Sarah but God changed her name and Jehovah Jireh number two brother Ram said notice after the appearing in this name of Almighty God and it was revealed to him to Abraham that he was the all-sufficient one he had no helpers he didn't need any any secretaries he was God alone God he was alone God he was God alone he appeared to Abraham in this name and when he appeared in this name and Abraham recognized who he was he changed Abraham's name now he's coming to the fullness of believing now see where the church has come I hope he can read between the lines come up to a place where he's revealed to him who he was and then he changed Abraham's name so the promise could be fulfilled didn't brother Bram say in the seals I'm gonna call you bride he's an uncultured he said what's the difference between a bride and a church a world of difference there's a world of difference between your wife and another woman huge difference and there's a huge difference between the Bride of Christ and the Church of Christ there's other good women but I've only got one wife right there's no there's good people in churches but God has one bride who stays true to him so it's time now that after the revelation of when God came down to Abraham and appeared to him in flesh Luke 17 30 he changed Abraham's name an expectation to chant to receive a promise son he said notice he changed his name here now from Abram to Abraham which means father of Nations added H am Abraham so he did this so that the complete promise could be fulfilled and the son now that had been promised so long could be seen or otherwise be revealed and when he changed his name and after he recognized who he was he might have been might have thought there were a party of them like lot but he recognized that he was Elohim God alone and when he did that then he changed his name he said now Abraham you're no more be called Abram but Abraham father of Nations I've made you Abraham now he is in the condition now he is in the condition after the revelation of who he was after the open door he is now in condition to see the Sun revealed after the revelation of who he was when Abraham got the revelation of who God was that he was God alone as he said here then he was able he was getting in condition to receive the body change and see the promised son and Abraham seed follows the same thing because there's a covenant that has to be confirmed God confirms his covenant covenant and agreement a promise you know in the old days to kill an animal they they what they would separate it and that's that you know they'd stand over and say let us be like this animal if we don't keep this covenant and that's what God did when he when he took his sacrifice his perfect sacrifice Jesus Christ he sent his spirit to the church he went up in glory so now that has got to be a ministry I don't have a piece of paper here to tear but there's got to be a minister that will dovetail just like that because it's his ministry and the bride's ministry has got to go like this and then that covenant is confirmed denomination is doing this don't fit right it's got to be like this remember the Chinese laundrymen it's tore in such a way they couldn't write a receipt when people came in the old days you know they could write and everything so they would just tear a receipt of center away and give it to you you had one piece there the other when he came to pick up your clothes it had to match oh you couldn't pick up your your clothes you know and I believe his brother Ram put it you know they left their dirty laundry there when they came back confirmed that covenant add a clean clean laundry right and that's what we do because our righteousness is as filthy rags before our works nothing don't do a single thing because if we did something then why is he why - he down the cross that's I hope this doesn't sound sacrilegious but that's like slapping God in the face to hear me sends his son to die for you and you try and do something right that's not how it works because we will never be good enough to be saved never be good enough to be saved now he changed Abraham because brother Graham said that ham was part of God's name when he came and Elohim h-i-m was part of God's name and he gave that to Abraham bridegroom is Jesus Christ we are the bride we share part of his name and when brother Ryan was preaching this he didn't say my name is Branham Billy Graham has six letters he said that but he didn't say Branham has seven he said Abraham has seven it's up to the we Heath trust the Holy Ghost to reveal that to the bride now some of you may already know this I did until recently but brother branham's name wasn't always spelled latm okay y'all knew that that's wonderful it was B ra n a.m. and we remember when his dad killed that man in the bar fighting everything and he had to change his name his dad was a sinner his dad was an alcoholic he didn't know nothing about this but he changed it to H a.m. instead of just you know B ra n a.m. he added to H to make it seven letters he didn't know it but God did remember brother Graham said that if you're not named right God will change it so don't say well my name ain't Brian oh my my last name only has six what brother branham is a bride and he represents us as the bride just like John represents us has the bride when you read about John's book revelations put your name there right so that God you know remember when Jesus in Luke 4 went to the temple and he opened the scroll the priest gave him the Bible look of Isaiah he read it he closed and gave it back to the priest the same thing happened with the Prophet when he memmer when he was preaching birth pains they came he that his wife gave him a Bible this is what I want it I want to mention this because I want you to realize I mean any of us do but I want to just edify let me put it that way I want to edify that this message does not come from man the things that are in here there's no way a man could have orchestrated this there is no way and just the name with Branham and H a.m. is a prime example now whenever he came and he was preaching birth pains his wife gave him a Bible and the pages were stuck together and he thought it was a misprint and he was looking forward and couldn't find it and there was a Catholic priest on the altar over there behind him and the priest gave her the brand the Bible because brother Ram said that the Pharisees in him they were though there were the order the religious order of the day just like the Catholic Church and they gave Jesus Christ the Bible he read it he closed it and gave it back and now all the congregation eyes were fixed on him and the Bible says that precious words proceeded out of his mouth so 2,000 years later God orchestrates the exact same picture now why didn't he do that in Luther's day right why did he do that in Wesley's day it's because his Jesus Christ all over again it's the fullness now it's the rapture time remember when Jesus was manifest to the first time Saints the Old Testament Saints went up with him he's manifested the second time the New Testament Saints we all go up so God changed his name he confirms his name he confirms his covenant rather the same ministry in the Bride Bible promised that he would get a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake and that life has got to come back into the bride that same oneness when brother Ram listened to that sermon oneness brother Ram is not talking about the Trinity he's talking about true oneness between the bride and Jesus Christ and that's what we have to be we've got to be whatever he was we've got to be because we are his body we are His Word and God made himself manifested he's come on down he's revealed to us the name we see now down through the church ages how they lost the name they lost the power they lost the word they got married to church and state that persecution that corn of wheat was in the ground but he said I will restore saith the Lord that is why we needed a restoration that is why we needed because without a restoration we'd be believing a word that's already gone by without a restoration we would be believe in the Jesus Christ of yesterday and that's sin when it's you know when it's presented to you and then you refuse to walk in at your sin because Jesus said had I not been made manifest you would not have had sin but once he became manifested and they rejected it it was sin and remember in the Book of Revelations remember Satan has a counterfeit for everything whatever satan cannot create so whenever there's he gets righteousness and he perverts it that's all he can do right allies just the truth that's just been perverted it's not quite the truth even if it's 99.9% the truth but one last it's a lie the whole thing is a lie so we see that Satan cannot create and in the Book of Revelations he's got names too but its names of blasphemy blasphemy esteems right which build around tells us the denominations it's not the people in the denominations it's the system we're not against anybody what we want to see is a personal relationship between Jesus Christ in an individual that's what we want to see but we want to see Jesus Christ and not something that passed by because jesus is alive remember he said I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Abraham Jacob Isaac and Jacob yes he's a God of the living and not a God of the Dead he's the great I am remember when in the manna in the wilderness whenever they left that manna it was canker the next day it had to be fresh it's spiritual food in due season it's got to be meat for the hour and as our dear brother read about in Psalms by the deep calleth unto the deep you know blessed is he that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled if there's that deep in there to call there's a deep to respond because God has created God was the one that created that thirst in us you know and many times we try and satisfy that thirst for something else but remember it's just perverted because we're given that thirst the Satan comes along and says this is which this was satisfy you this was satisfied and it never does here's only one that can satisfy I want to close with this quote in the marriage of the Lamb he said but you see first decisions made next engagement to then promise and then the ceremony that's when the bride brought takes the bridegroom's name she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name she's no longer a Church of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now I don't mean that by name I mean that by birth by nature by power of God by the revealed truth of God in the heart she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes a part of Christ when she does that she Christ injects into her his own spirit his own life and the Bible said to Adam and Eve there you are no longer Twain but one and when the woman church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one Christ in you amen that's it his life has been brought into you then you become the bride then you become the bride like I said it's not just he said over here it's not just like a you know it's not just an intellectual Lord I promise to do good is when he truly by birth become the Bride of Christ then it's his life living through you because no person can walk no person can live a Christian life it takes Christ in the individual to live a Christian life it takes Jesus Christ in us to believe the message that's what it is it's it's him in you believing his own word because we're a part of him we are a part of him so hope something this morning has helped you about the name about how it's been lost in the church ages and the importance of why God needed to send a prophet because it's become so common God sent a prophet and we know that but pray to God if you don't already have that revelation why God needed to send a prophet because God don't do nothing without he don't do nothing without a reason he needed to send a prophet to buy to all these mysteries up and the bride can be perfected by because he said the bridegroom call will come through this remember he said that the messenger on earth is so inclined to God that what the messenger speaks on earth God echoes in heaven and I believe the bride's coming to that state too because she is the body because it's not the thoughts of man it's the thoughts of God and the word is in the bride amen it's the church now we've got to eat the book and become part of it when we become a part of it then one day we'll just see our loved ones come up and when we see them we'll be quickened and I believe that'll be you know the last you know I believe we're already getting ready to just get out of here and God is just bringing us to a point of weakness and then once that point of weakness comes and his strength can be made perfect when our strength is gone you know and you take that all the way from your personal every day to the bride as a whole when you're weak when you're exhausted when you can't do nothing that's when he can move he said the greatest enemy I have is William Brown the greatest enemy you have is yourself a bears enemy I have is myself if I can just get myself out of the way no we're talking about gifts and things you know it's not necessarily mentioned is one of the one of the nine spiritual gifts and things but I believe it's a gift that God helps us get out of the way it's not just for ministers because everybody has a place everybody has a place you know and I'm just a little bitty gear but you know if somebody is not in the right if one little gears out then the other gears there's no big one there's no big people little people but there's people that have to have you know big here's little gears whatever but if say even the oil is not on the gear then the gear rust then the rust spreads and the whole thing quits working so everybody has got a place everybody has got a place so if we can just yield ourselves to that place God will have his way and that's a challenge for each and every one of us if we can just you know my prayers God helped me get to a place of weakness God helped me be so weak I can't do nothing because that's when he can that's when he can do everything any time we're trying to solve our problems we just mess it up anytime we jump the gun so called and as we just you know trying and just do things within ourselves it never works out but if we pray about it and put God first he will lead you every single time every single time they ma'am I'm gonna turn the service back to our brother Dale I appreciate y'all so much and again thank you for the opportunity to just share my heart I've been that's what I just felt like the Lord put upon my heart to share with you all and we love you so much and we're standing with you and we're down there Mobile believing the same word one day you know now we're just separated by geography and this and that but one day there'll be no separation we'll all be together we all have the same father just think about you remember brother Theo Erasmus I remember one time there's about a good point and he said you know he said his name is Jesus as Jes us and he said you take us out of it and said his name is Jess so if you leave the bride out of it then it's not a complete night his name is Chester that's a good point you just think is he cold we don't want to leave nothing out and what we are is what he has made us but you know I didn't choose that did you I didn't have anything to do it he chose me but he's got some reason for you something for you to do or whatever so just be whatever you are let's sing brother 668 let's sing a little bit and worship and just believe since Jesus thank God his name is Jesus right jeez it was a revelation they took the ride around I see another one true and living God and gave us a Trinity the Father Son and Holy Ghost by doing that they met missed everything the meaning of that night anybody else if you have a name that name is No see see that way that all the way down 2/3 her brother would bring it they could pronounce at night Jamie aids me no way to pronounce tonight Oh Lynette you out no we're putting fouled you call it back up with his family that could do it what he said one day like this my name was I never known see they cook top of that understand one day an angel I was referring to game called his name Jesus do you know what I love about that but his name Jesus would pronounce that was to be in immanuel god without you call his name Jesus that was that dude coming down or dead bhp for now human race I know his name but that was an angel for delivering it do you know what happened next first time to human all that name to another human Littlejohn and the world of it mother chuckle I proceed the name of Jesus I made yogurt pronouncing the name you could tell you when angle had no connection be able to make it manifest but it would be call that name Jesus do another he would be and the name of Jesus every knee should bow I did what are we gonna do with it that's why like a brotherhood say in a matter and we don't know the Father Son Holy Ghost ride we can prove to you by your own encyclopedias where the Catholic Church ain't that but that ain't no argument with nobody because you're not gonna believe it anyway you're gonna come up with your side of it we go back to the Bible he said in the name it didn't say the names of Father Son and Holy Ghost he said in the name st. Gera what is that name senior fathers none only goes Lord Jesus Christ we see with Catholic Church they took that because they knew they'd have to take away that name and that was the only way they could do it the way they done it was taking away the name not making it being a different name but took away the revelation Jesus was standing there one day and he said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sin well then he was either Almighty God or the greatest deceiver the world had ever had then what are we gonna do about it well I'll take what Peter says no you're taking what the Catholic Church says because Peters hid in the name singular of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost you mean that a man that you give him the keys he opens the keys to the kingdom Jews and Gentiles oh and he can't remember ten days in the time you tell him Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost no I didn't deny that that's in the Bible because it's hidden from the wise and prudent Napoleon this rock I'll build my church upon this revelation and Peter turned to renter and said they said men and brethren what much did he said in the name of Jesus Christ and Amanda couldn't keep it straight for ten days and he's supposed to be the leader of the church you mean he couldn't remember father son Holy Ghost for ten days that it's not even sensible is it we see it's the Word of God that's the word Jesus is that word let's sing another one for it it's gonna be a little bit for to get them ready downstairs and we we're not gonna be in no hurry we take a wild if I rather fish in the chicken and honey we want you to fellowship together we can do that outside and all we're gonna eat inside cause it'd be a lot cooler all right but then if you want to take yours outside you if some of the sisters was telling me this morning they didn't know how to eat fish I said we'll teach you how to eat fish yeah too many bones in them if you know how to eat it it's not no problems you're not gonna get a bone we'll teach you how to eat fish if you want to our brothers taught us how to catch fish right in the name of Jesus that's the way you catch fish let's go let's say he ain't God good old things are passed away make sure you die once you reach into magic we are and we are we are we are children you stay away from where they're cooking what they're doing nothing safe
