asked of you lord if we would just ask and believe lord we commit all things to you tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen ephesians chapter 1 and says verse 3 says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and hebrews chapter one let's go up there somebody's got the scripture mixed up there anyway hebrews chapter one is very familiar scripture and it says god who at sundered times and in divers matters spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power that he had by himself purged our sins when he had by himself purge our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they amen god bless you tonight you can be seated and i want to take a little thought called expression of the attributes of god and brother bran this is quote number one brother of the rem says in in christ the mystery of god he said now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had made a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be savior in him was to be healer and all these great attributes that we we see already expressed they were in god and so i and um the quote number two here is uh is the word expression and the definition here um the definition of the word expression i want to lay this out um it says the process of making one's one's own thoughts or feelings known making known one's thoughts or feelings i look of on someone's face that conveys a particular emotion a word or phrase especially an idiomatic one used to convey an idea an act process or means by putting something into words so i i want to look at something tonight about being about the expression of the attributes of god and you know it's so amazing sometimes when you when you read the scripture you know it's so amazing when you when you see where you came from and to where you are you know when you begin to read here in ephesians chapter one it it just it's so it's so amazing and you know you know the song says there's no other word for grace but amazing when you begin to see here he said bless and be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places so we know that he the heavenly places is a position that the believer has in christ and we know that you know that goes back to what uh broadway's been preaching on adoption having a position that god has placed you and you have a position to come to in christ and he has and he's blessed us to come to that place you're in a you're you're blessed to be in the place that you are today if you're in christ then you're an overcomer so you've been blessed to come to this place but you know there's a greater place to come to and you know that's the blessings of god and it says according as he has chosen us in him you know i'm so glad he chose me you know he made a way for me to come through in the great mind of god he knew the plan of salvation that he would choose me that that he knew that he if he brought the word in that i would receive it that he had made that that i was always a part of him and you know and you know as brother brown said you know he said if you receive eternal life you always were eternal you are always in the mind of god you're always a part of him and so we always that we we were a part of him that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you know there was a place that god called us to be overcomers before the foundation of the world god saw you as an overcomer before the foundation of the world for the foundation of the world and your faults and failures and your sins and your shortcomings you still knew that you had overcome and god looked down through time to see and they and here it knew that you would be in laodicea in in this in this spiritual wicked time but he knew that you'd be an overcomer and so sometimes when we see these things you know to realize who we are you know because i you you can't sometimes you just can't put into words what that means it means you know because i i get stirred up sometimes because you know we can we get so blinded to the things of what god is trying to convey to us or what god wants to tell us but to see who we really are what god has blessed us to you know who who who am i that that he that he would take that he would leave the throne of glory all of the all of his glory and splendor but he would come and and condescend to me and if there was nobody else to be saved he would come and he would do all of that to save me it's it's a glorious thing to know what god thinks of you you know uh brother adam was talking about you know he said if i had the literal blood of jesus christ you know how how i would you know watch over and protect it and you know he'd be so careful with it but he said you know it's it's more that that the purchased possession of that blood is is you and i we're we are the purchased possession of that blood so if we've been bought by uh by the blood of jesus christ if we've been bought by a price then you know what how much greater does he think of you and i than he did of his own life because he he came he came and he exchanged his life for yours when you go when you go to the store and you take money into a store to buy something and you walk in there and you see something then you value what the the va that item that you go in there and buy you value that more than your money so you have a value so you put a value to that so whatever you whatever you long for whatever you desire you put a value on that and you say that that is more valuable that means more to me than what i have so he did you know because he came to give his life for yours to know to know what would take place that it that he would come and pay the price for you and i right and how how wonderful that is to realize what he thinks of you and i man he said according to us he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will so he he called us to adoption amen so not just not just not just to be a a child of god but there's a place to come to so so it's not just you know because we don't just want to have have our children be our children but we want children to grow up and we want we want them to come to maturity and we want we want them to express these things that that are that are right and proper so when he come you know it was it wasn't that he just gave us eternal life but he called us to adoption but he made a way for us to come to the statue of fullness of christ that we can manifest jesus christ to make jesus christ known he said that we should be holy and without blame before him in love i'm so i'm so glad you know because what whatever whatever our our our sins are what whatever our shortcomings you know what there's still a greater blood there's still a greater covering for all that no matter what your what your sins are what are those though they'll be scarlet no matter what it is they're still away god's made because the the sea of god's forgetfulness is greater than all of that greater than all my sins greater than all all of my pain greater than anything he's greater than that he's greater than all that i'll ever face why he said he said who can separate me from the love of god paul said he said he said can death can nakedness can famine can all these things is there anything in the world no there's nothing the devil will try to separate you but you know what he's a failure he's always going to fail but you know he will try but you know what there's no way he's going to be able to separate you well because you've been engraved in the palms of his hands there's no way that he's going to lose you he said he said i've called my own and he said no one can pluck them from my hands well that's what god has called us to when we see it when we see ourselves in the word when we see ourselves we realize how how short below our standard we live we we understand how who we are but you know what he's still there leading us he's still guiding us he still loves us he said to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved see i didn't have to be accepted i was accepted in him in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which you have purposed in himself amen he made known to us the mystery of his will and i read i read christ the mystery there brother i'm talking about the secret mystery that god had that he had a purpose in that secret mystery you know and i don't i don't i don't want to sound funny but it it may it may sound funny but you know some people want one you know if you understand what a secret is you know if if i had something and nobody knew about it and i told brother boyd that you know what brother boyd and i have a secret but you know what they would it would be s it would be a secret to the rest of you but so when we say we have a we have a secret well really me and brother boyd know about it but y'all don't that's the secret that's the reason in hebrews or amos 3 7 he said that he would reveal his secret under the his servants the prophet see he was making known that secret by the unfolding of the word was coming through the prophets as they were building the body the ministry that they had that was the secret that was being made known but then in the in the last time it would it would become a mystery why because as it becomes as it begins to unfold then it becomes a mysterious thing now you know you know and and i i know some some people don't you hate you hate but some people don't though if you listen to them sometimes you wonder if if they think that brother branham come to it's like well you know what i was i was in denominations or i was in the world or wherever and brother branham come and he preached and and he come to preach to make us more confused than we were in organized religion and that was that was the mystery he's like he can't he come to confuse us and it's like that's and it's like no no no no no you you got to understand the the he said the unto no having made known unto us the mystery of his will i would you catch it he wanted us to to make known unto us the mystery well what is the finishing of a mystery it's a revelation so when you have a mystery see it had to become a secret first because if you if you've never seen anything if you've never heard of anything then it's a secret dude because you don't know it exists just when just when you know if you know what you you know you go to school and they they talk about certain things and you know you they start teaching you things well if you don't if you don't know anything about it guess what it's all a mystery to you just just like when lewis and clark went on their expedition and they had a black man in the group and the and the indians when they when lewis and clark went to the indians they had never seen the black men before they never they didn't know and they were so mysterious i mean it was so mesmerized by this man that they that they were you know just gingerly walking up to this man looking at him said they tried to rub the black off of him why they've never seen one before but so and it's the same way with us you know when god begins to unfold things it becomes a mysterious thing just you know when the first time that and unless you unless you always knew something well the first time if you grew up in a in a trinitarian background trinitarian church the first time somebody got up and preached on water baptism in jesus name in acts 2 38 and you might have read the bible up ten times you might have got a bunch of gold stars at church but you know when you read acts 2 38 it didn't mean anything to you you'd ran over and just skimmed right over and all of a sudden was somebody coming in and said baptize in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and then all of a sudden it catches your attention and it's like are we baptizing right then all of a sudden then it becomes a mystery why because it it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't hid it's always in black and white it's always been in the bible somebody had somebody had a piece of paper over in your bible and one day they just peeled it off oh there it is no it was always there but it but through god's grace he opened your eyes to that and then all of a sudden people's like well uh you know then they begin to think well is is that right then then it becomes a mystery was it why why why are they always reading matthew 28 19 and was acts 2 38 and then it's all like then all of a sudden you realize hey you know what matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38 it's the same scripture but they don't they don't see that all of a sudden no we got to take this scripture not that scripture no they dovetail it's like well you know because then that's that was a scripture that peter had on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost failed and the holy ghost started leading peter and he began to speak and they took that scripture and he said and this this promise is unto you and your children to them that's far off even as many as the lord and our god shall call well well i guess if god calls me i guess i need to take that scripture i guess he's calling me i guess that's the scripture that belongs to me but then somebody was like well no no well our church believes this our church believes this well that's why i was baptized and they stay right where they're at and so then they turn the word down because god's showing them what the truth is to show there's there what god has made known so he's making known the mystery of his will which is his word and it's a continue and it's not just one thing but it's a continuation to uh realize who you are and who who he is and what god has called called us to he said that in the dispensation of the fullness times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance oh now everybody likes the word inheritance we got we got something now see god being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will so he didn't he didn't come to give us an inheritance he come to bring us back to our inheritance why because we see that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world he had a place so he's taken us back to where we came from us to see who we really are where we came from not just not just living in in these three dimensions but god has something greater for us to know that where we came from and this is just this is just these things are temporal and all these things but there's something that's eternal there's a place to go to that's eternal he said in whom he said that we may that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted that after ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise i'm so i'm so glad that that i know the truth and i've heard the truth and you know and so many times you hear so many people and you know they talk about having a seed we know we had a seed of representation of predestination but you know paul said we had to hear the word you had to have the seed sown and the seed comes through the body and the word came and then we held on to that word and we were sealed by the holy spirit of promise so it was it was overcoming for us that we held on but we believed what god said and he come and he spoke to us he made known us the mystery of his will he made known his word to us and we believed and we held on to that and we were sealed by that holy spirit because that was the promise of acts 2 which is the earnest of our inheritance under the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory so we know that we have this inheritance god has called us to this this is what god wants us to have and god has it brother ram said he had that great mystery secret that he had before the world began and he wanted to express himself he said he had attributes that he wanted to be expressed and so he had so he set up set up a plan you know that he he set up a plan that would bring to pass all of these attributes you know he said everything in motion you know he he said adam and eve in the garden and and everything that set up everything that they had free moral agency that they ever they wanted to he knew what would take place but thank god that he that he knew what was going to take place and you know you never never catch god out of uh by surprise you know he never was worried about anything why because he already had a plan he already had a purpose he had already had a way made there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that would all take care of all of that so all of that was taken care of we didn't have to worry about any of that because god had a way mate and so when all of that was what was going on it wasn't that that god had to had to worry about or try to figure out some people talk about you know well adam and eve fell and god had god had to send his son no his son had already came it stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world before there was ever a molecule or an atom before there was anything before because of being the thought the eternal thoughts of god the lamb was already slain he knew what would take place and it was already made well sometimes you know people people you know as brother random said if you could you imagine a four foot pipe all the water in the world in the four foot pipe and the pressure that's in that pipe and god on one side of it trying to give you the holy ghost trying to deal with you and trying to bless you and and you stand under the lord will you help me lord would you give me the holy ghost he's trying to give it to you but the problem is is we can't get ourselves out of the way we can do we don't we can't get to the place where we can dial lord lord help my help my unbelief that i can get out of the way that you can bless me why because you said it was for me and so the problem is is if if god doesn't change and he's done it before and he keeps on doing it and he keeps on making the promise that the problem is not with god then the problem is with me it's my problem that i got to get myself out of the way i got to get myself on the altar and die out all 300 pounds got a lot of dying out to do but there's a lot but you know if we can we can just commit to god and we can submit to god and put our faith in that god can do the work many times everybody you know sometimes we we get so worked up and we're trying to do do's and don'ts and and and you know we're so afraid to walk around on eggshells and stuff and it's like you know the main thing is if you can pray through to god let god talk to you you know you know it's so amazing when when people talk about praying lots of times it's i'm praying i'm doing the talking and then when i get done i say amen and that's it he's like you pick up the phone and you talk to somebody okay bye that's all you get why because they do all the talking now some people think that's me but that's not there's been there's been several people i've i've talked to on the phone and i go mm-hmm and then other times [Laughter] wait and tell you that talk to him on the phone fall asleep snoring his ear wake up i've heard that lots not just behind the pulpit i've actually heard it on the phone but you know god has has a desire for us that he wants us to reach out and and and come to this place that god can bless us and give us what we have need here in here in in hebrews and i i don't i don't know how far i'm going to get with this tonight but uh i i just want to share a few things but here here in hebrews and and understanding who we are and what god has for us and what what he wants us to have us to see who we are and he said god and who in sundried times in endower's manner spake in times past by the father unto the fathers by the prophets as we were speaking earlier the prophets began to speak he revealed his secret through the prophets he said hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son and whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the power of his word when he had purged he when he had by himself purge our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and i want to i want to look at this this phrase and and some of y'all may remember me preaching a message a number of years ago on the essence of god and when you take the the ex the first phrase here express image one of the translations of this is the expression of the uh the essence of god and so you know many times you can see where they say um they'll say it's the representation of the essence of god or it's the uh the expression of um who god is but you know i i like that i like that where he said he's the translation where it says he's he's the expression of the essence of god and you know if you look at if you if some of you may remember me preaching on that when i talked about what the essence of something is and the essence of something is is the set of attributes or characteristics or qualities of something that makes it what it is without without those qualities or characteristics it's not what it is it has to have each one of those to be what it is and it has it and and the definition says it has it by necessity so it's necessary for him to have the this object or substance or whatever it has to have all of these qualities to be that and so when it has all of these qualities then it says it's by necessity so it must have them but it says it's not by accident he has all these qualities or it this subject and you know we talked about like we talked about like a chair and you know you look at a chair and the chair has a you know a seat it has a back and it has four legs on it but you know if you're talking about a wooden a wood chair well none of these none of these chairs would count because you know brother dale's always said if you start with a white dog in genesis you better end up with a white dog in revelation and whatever he started whatever was in the mind of god in the beginning that's what's supposed to be in the end that's he doesn't change because brother rhymes said he doesn't change in essence or behavior so whatever he started with that's what he's going to end up with so when you look at when you look at a chair when you when you look at that chair when you see that object then you know what characteristics it has because you know what a chair is but when we talk about well people well we're just talking about something to sit on well not necessarily because if it doesn't have the characteristics we're sure you can sit on it but it's not what the what the original word was now that we got we got well we got something that it's made out of wood over here it's this uh piano bench well it's made out of wood but you know what it's it doesn't have a back to it so it's lacking now these these these all i don't know there may be some wood inside effort cut the cushion off of it but you know what that's not that's not what the original word was so when we look at and you know there's the drum seat over there you know it has it has different characteristics but it's not exactly what the original word was so if you don't have what the original word was if you don't have the original characteristics then it's not what was the original and so you have to have the what those characteristics are those attributes that god has then he had he had each one of those and that's what made him god because if he did just like just like he said satan had couldn't be a creator but god could be a creator and he was and satan was just like god except he couldn't create so you know no matter how much satan said that that i will be like the most high and i'm gonna lift myself up you know what he'll never be able to take that place why because he does not have all of the attributes that god has he cannot so he so he'll never take that place but he'll try but when god has all these attributes just like just like when you when you speak of a chair or something all of those attributes that whatever the attributes that god has that's what he wanted to express now he could he could express he could have had children and been a father and and they would have been wonderful that he would that we would have he would have the children of god but he wouldn't have been able to express all of his attributes so he had a he had a plan and a purpose that he wanted to express all of the attributes that were inside of him he wanted he wanted to manifest everything and so when he began to express then then through a fall that he can be a then he can be a savior that he can be a healer and then not only just have the uh the children of god but that he can give that he can give eternal life to the fullest virgins he can he can give it to uh those that are good to to the bride there's other groups that he can give the eternal life to that that he wouldn't have that opportunity if if it was just straightforward hey i'm just gonna have children but there was a plan that so we can see that he is able to expand himself and he's been able to show more of himself to show that the greater attributes that he has and you know because brother ram said that the greatest attribute that you know the essence of god is love and you know you know i was i was talking to a man the other day and and he he belongs to a certain group and you know they uh they don't they don't believe that they believe that the jews are dying done and over with and you know god put away the jews and that was it and they're done and don't worry about it but you know the 144 000 are a bunch of gentiles that they're going to be called in and and he was talking to me about and and i i've never i never heard anybody say such stuff and you know i i you just try to talk to people and they want to talk and i'll just try to help them but you know it's like well what paul what part of the bible in revelation when he said there was 144 thousand he called 12 000 out of eight's tribe and he called them by name what part of that don't you understand i mean when when when you go back into scripture and you look at daniel 9 and you start laying out the plan that there's a message and when you talk about the the two witnesses that are coming there's got to be and the scripture tells us that the bride leaves there's the gentiles days are over with and there's a rapture and the word's got to go back to them it's like okay well then then how then if if that if it's like well please explain to me how this works and he said well you don't under you don't understand the two witnesses and i was like well i think i probably got a better idea who they are than you do but you know it's interesting that to hear people talking it's like well you need to understand what this means and you got to understand what that means like what you want me to do is is listen to what what your doctrine is on what the bible says not what the bible says but we're going to look at your doctrine and many times that's the way people are they want you to listen to what what they say it is not what the word of god says and so you know i i don't get to talk to him very all you know just every now and then but i just go by and i just try to give him a word here and word there and you know and i like to hear what he has to say because it's it's interesting to hear what other people what other people believe and and then you just try to sow a little seed here there you know brother brown says here he said this is uh from uh sir we would see jesus 1964. he said in the beginning god was not even god he was the great eternal and in there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he become a word like this and a word expressed he said well a thought expressed is a word a word expressed as a thought and then remember he said if you ever was in god's thinking you'll always be there if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age if not there is only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks is what god eternal you always was see in his thinking and he said it was in him to be a man to be man that's the reason christ was the expressed image so he was the he was the expression of the essence of god see now he was to be father he was to be son he was to be savior he was to be healer there was nothing there wasn't even an angel or nothing then he created angels then he became god he was worshiped then these are the manifestations of his thinking there is nothing wrong everything is going to turn out all right don't be scared god's big timepiece is ticking right along it'll be there it'll have a church without spot or wrinkle it was in his thinking the thing of it is the thing of it is am i in there and are you in there amen and here he was the great the eternal thought of god expressed into sonship oh my there was god emmanuel then notice then he was the word so we understand that before all you know that we were in his thinking we were a part of him and he thought of all things and as i was saying you know that that he knew that all things was going to take place and brother brown says you know don't worry about it because god already knew what was going to take place and god has a great time peace god has a time piece and he already had everything worked and so it was just going to work out just fine just perfect and we don't have to worry about all we got to do is put our confidence in him because we don't have to know what the future holds but we know who holds the future we know what the what is going to take place why because god's going to lead us i thank god that i can have some place to put my confidence and my trust because there's no other place in this world to be able to have confidence when you see the world and the condition that it's seeing and it's so so thankful that god has given us a word in our day to tell us what's going to take place so when people like my have you ever seen anything like this before can you imagine such things as this yeah god told us in his word it was going to take place yeah we knew this was going to take place why god told us it would happen this way well because he gave us i said to see that we would know these things so you know it's it's just right on time it's happening just the way it's supposed to thank god but we know what's going to take place yeah we we might have hard times and we might have hardships and problems everything like that but thank god before all this falls apart we're going to be out of here why because you know what we don't have to go through the wrath of god we don't have to go through tribulation we're going to be out of here there's a way of escape that's made for us this is from the smyrna church age brethren says the eternal thoughts of god he said let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal he said if you can see this you can see many things god is unchangeable and changeable in both essence and behavior amen he said we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his ability so therefore he is god must be omniscient he said if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge he said if he can add to his knowledge and he's not omniscient the best we could say that at some times he he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god he said thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are simply they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and a part of god so thank god that we know that his thoughts are more real than our thoughts than anything because that is what's going to take place that is what's real he said so then he doesn't have to worry about you know having a having a second thought or hacking a second opinion everything like he knows what's going to take place and that's what's going to take place and that's what we're living today and god knew what was going to take place knew that knew who would be here and who would not be here all of your problems everything that would you would take play everything that you would do in this life but thank god he knew that that we would come and overcome amen amen this is from john chapter 15 verses 14 brother rob says or the scripture says he said ye are my friends jesus speaking he said if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you he said ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you these things i command you that you love one another and if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you and if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you're not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you amen i'm so glad to know that he called us we didn't choose him he chose us and he called us to be fruitful well then guess what the scripture talks about adding to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and and and growing up the statue of a perfect man and he said he said if these things be in you and abound he said you'll not be fruit and fruitless that you won't be without fruit because you know what the thing is here's what he's called you too and it's so amazing because many times you know we we sometimes we don't realize what god has called us to you know because it's you know brother i'm talking about that little fish being in the in the water and he's he just barely sipping on the water out there in the ocean it's like well you know what i may run out of water before too long and not realizing the vastness of the ocean and out there well you know i don't know how long this thing is going to last and not realizing not realizing the vastness of god's plan or the god's love or his provision to us he's like well you know you know i will i don't i don't want to i don't want to bother god you know i i you know you know i don't know what to do you know what my my kids don't don't mind bothering me my kids my kids don't bother me you know they don't mind whatsoever and i can tell you what your kids didn't don't bother my mind bothering you either you know because he said he said ask and you shall and you shall fight seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you ask and it shall be given unto you you know i got my boys you know they don't mind something sometimes they get on my nerves because i've been there mama mama mama mama mama mama mama mama mama yeah and daddy daddy daddy hey daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy like would you just quit saying daddy and just ask what you want but you know they don't mind and even if you get upset and you can you be quiet i'm trying to do something okay they'll stand right there no way all right we waited 30 seconds daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy and he said he said if if your son asked you for bread he said would you give him a stone he said if your child asks you for fish would you give him a serpent he said he said if ye being evil know how to good gifts give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give good gifts to them and one place he said we'll give the holy ghost to those that ask so if you have if you have a need you have a request but then what it is well i don't i don't want i don't know you know what the ones that seek and press and keep pressing and keep pushing and keep clawing and whatever it takes and keep going forward you know what those are the ones that go overcome and get what they have need of so it's not it's not just going one time and well you know i didn't i didn't get one i didn't get what i wanted well it's the one that stays there just just like the the parable of the unjust judge you know he he said this woman wearies me she's there all the time and he said he said i don't want to do anything for her but because she pesters me so much i'm going to do something for her i'm going to help her in her situation why because i'm tired of dealing with her well the other thing is god doesn't have that same attitude but he has the same desire that you would seek because you know what sometimes god wants to see what you're going to do he'll come to the place well he said well i didn't get it the first time we'll get right i'm not going to ask anymore well you know what you're not going to get anything just just like when the uh what was the syrophoenician woman there you know and and you know hey you know she calls out son of david and you know what he's like ain't no ain't talking to you he don't even look in her direction he got he got no business talking to her don't care and then she and then she's you know trying to get his attention and calling to him he ain't listening but then when she says lord well he turns to her what what do you want lord i got a sick daughter lord i i want you to heal my daughter my daughter needs to be healed well let me tell you something you know a lot of people a lot of people would get upset when jesus said you know it's not me to give the children's bread to dogs i can't believe he said that to me but you know what it didn't matter what what he said oh anymore all she wanted was for him to heal her daughter it don't matter what you say jesus i don't care you can put me down you can say why because it's all true but you know what the dog's eating the crumbs of the master's table that's what i want i don't care what else he said if we can humble ourselves then we'll be raised up but the problem is we can't be humbled many times we get we allow things to get in our way and and hold us back because we we can't be humble and many times you know things will happen and you know people get so be uh so upset but things that have happened or things that people have said and you know the thing is it you spend more time worried about something that's so inconsequential in the long run somebody will make it make a comment and people will sit and and dwell on it for the longest time and it just eats them up and it takes up all their time why can't what is what do they mean by that what do they mean by that i can't believe they said that and then you know they spend all their time worrying about what that what that means and what what what what somebody else says about them i wonder if she told somebody else and in the long run you know some people some people when they when they after they dwelled on it for the longest time and it's took up all their time and worried and they get all upset about it you know what whoever said it sometimes i don't even remember saying it but you know what we we've got to we've we've spent all of our time wrapped up in things that don't really matter and so you know but if if we just stay on core if we stay where god has us rather than you know we receive what we have need of just lay all these things down i don't you know there's no need of carrying it around it it ain't it ain't it ain't profitable with me it ain't profitable to you guess what we're just gonna lay it down i'm just gonna put it behind me i'm not worried about it because i i just can't just can't worry about carrying on it and dealing with it but god wants us to be what god wants us to be to manifest this is from the future home and he says he says if if you have if you've got eternal life he said there's only one form that's god and he said you are an expressed attribute see he said if you're if you if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father has drawn him see which passes away all these old things but these things don't so it speaks of eternity the holy ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened see you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in god that thought of you and expressed you and he made a earth to take you out of and made you a human being and sin come along and perverted that what his way you come anyhow but he was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute and also redeemed this earth by the same same way then see his purpose rolls on see oh hallelujah oh that does me so good so much good think of of just what lies lays ahead so we know that god we're always in the mind of god and god come across your path and you became an expressed attribute and god always knew what you would be but you came into this earth and and through through the new birth you've come to this place to be an attribute of what god wants you to be and so many and he's like well what god what does god want us to be what god leads us to what the word says about us because the word is going to lead you and so many you know if people get so you know upset or they get worked up about things just trust god let god lead you and he'll show you what what needs to be what god wants you to do what god wants you to be many times you know people they they want to try to figure things out no don't get ahead of god let god work and god do the plan god will work the plan if we'll do our part well because it's a daily walk and if we just walk with him then you know what all things will run perfect you know you know we look brother man was speaking and he was talking about how nature he said nature runs in continuity he said nature runs in continuity with with the word of god he said you know so you know we don't have uh when he spoke and put all these things in in the world in in place you know the the rotation of the earth and and the earth orbit and all those type things all the things that take place you know god god spoke them and that was it and well you know we can and it's so perfect that when we go and look you know we can track the years and where all the planets will be and all of the asteroids and all kinds of things all the positions of all these different things in the future and in the past we know where all these things are one because we know there's a perfect pattern to all of it so when it all sets in when it all becomes set in order and it works in continuity then guess what you know there's not there's not one time where where one year that you know we're we're a short a few days or we're we're a few hours over no it it comes out every single year 365 and a quarter and we don't have to worry about it because nothing's out of cater but you know what we get so worried about trying to fit in or trying to figure things out but you know what if we just work in continuity with god and we put our trust in god then you know what he spoke it then guess what it's going to work then you know i i'm not i'm not trying to figure out what i need to do because you know i'm just going to trust god because let god speak to me then then it'll work exactly the way it needs to it all works in continuity you know when and we you see all these in in the scripture in different places you know brother i'm talking about how all all nature and all everything works in continuity and all things were were spoken by the word of god are they all put in place and they all have a purpose and they do exactly what they're supposed to do you know einstein when you know when brother brown always talks about you know einstein and all of his all of his theories and and all of the things that that he was able to do and brother brown said if if einstein could have put the spiritual with the with the natural application he said he really could have told us something you know when he began to when he began to look at all these things and you know in einstein being able to see all the things that he had saw and understood you know brother i'm talking about how how man had broke into god's laboratory and and you know all the things that he could he could talk about and he could see any you know brother uh brother i'm talking about einstein talking about the center of the universe and you know all the things that he could prove by science and knew what these things were and you know and then when when all of that was said and done when einstein had done all of the things that he had done and and studied and wrote about and all the experiments then then when he said how did all this come about wasn't one of the greatest being in the world one of probably one of the smartest men in all the world and there he stood and he quotes hebrews 11 3 that would that we know that the world the worlds were framed by the word of god so we know that the word of god is what brought it into pass and and all of on all of the the learning and the studying and all this stuff it only took one thing it was the word of god that einstein and all the things all of the studying and all of the learning and everything all of the experiments that he could do it took the word of god to put all this together why because no there's there's nothing he said so that the world the worlds were made by things which do not appear so all these things took place and and all the vastness and all that kind of stuff and then the one thing that he was convinced that it took a creator it took a divine power to put all this together and then you know when he said all this stuff and he made all this and put it all together and then this this was all of his expressed attributes these all each part come into place and then here he said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness so this is what god called us to to be to be like him to god made us and then and then we wonder why you know then we allow the devil to hold us back we're bound by by things that the devil has allowed us to be get in our way when we are to be an overcomer what god has created us to to be to be in this divine order if everything else runs in continuity and and has a has a perfect place then guess what you and i have a perfect place also god has called us into a perfect realm you know that we don't have we don't have to uh worry about what what's going to take place god's already made a way for us this is from the the seed shall not be air with a shuck he said that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be expressed this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day it's the same word same experience same life for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male male and female and then genesis 2 and on he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he became flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he never taken and made another thing but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ he said that's why the rapture of the royal sea will have to come first so we understand that when when god said all this in motion then then understand that you know as as he took from adam he was always in adam she was always a part of him but it became that had to be a time to be expressed and it was a time to be manifested and you know he said but she's born of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life brother i said it's the same spirit it's the same the same experience and so all these parts have come together and the same way with you and i that we were always a part of him that we come to be an expression of him that what he is that we express the same thing that we make known the same thing and you know because if he overcame then you know what you and i overcome also he said he said because i overcame he said you will overcome also but god has called us to a place that we understand how these things take place and what's to what's going to take place how things are going to unfold you know um speaking of of einstein and you know all of the great theories and the understanding that he had and all the things that that he was able to do you know if we understand when we look brother brahm said the natural types the spiritual when you look at the natural and you see how things work in continuity and perfect then guess what then you and i are the same way then you know what that's what god called us to that god has called us the bride is the same as him when when he began in the beginning when he said let there be light you know what he didn't have to worry if that was going to come to pass or not he said he said when he said let there be light he said he said he said he believed his own word and there was light then you know he didn't have to he didn't have to worry if it was going to take place why because he knew it would take place and it's the same way with you and i you know many times what we would get in our in our own way sometimes but understand that god has a wife for made for us and you know when we look at these things i i i want to share this this thought with you you know when we when we talk about physics and and all the things that einstein was able to prove and you know there was one thing that einstein had trouble with and and somebody and some of y'all may know more about this than than i do but i i just think it's it's a it's a fascinating thing but you know all things natural types of spiritual and you know einstein and other scientists you know some of y'all probably know what quantum mechanics is well it's it's a it's a it's a um a quantum is the smallest particle that can have an interaction with each other in space or in the world in the universe but anyway uh in quantum mechanics it's a uh understanding you know there was um in the 20th century there were several advancements in physics one of them was the theory of relativity to understand how everything nothing travels faster than the speed of light and you know how he said if you could travel at the speed of light you know einstein said you could have two objects approaching each other and they'd go right through each other and not mess either one of them up you could pass through each other and and so there was something that took place in and quantum mechanics was the other and there is a um a thing that takes place with two when you have two particles and they they become it and there's an interaction with these two there's a there's a connection that's made between these two particles sometimes electrons or whatever but usually it's two particles and they they have this connection that's made between them and science calls calls it entanglement and when you when you take these two items these two so particles and they they have this relationship and they become connected and there's a relationship between these two particles then you can take one of those particles and you can move it hundreds of light years in one way and you can put the other one 100 hundreds of light years in the other way and they're separated and what blew einstein's mind is because he's based on the theory of relativity what they proved by relativity that if this one's 100 miles away and that was 100 miles away then it would take the the that traveling the light speed of light would have to travel between those two particles but what in quantum mechanics what they were seeing was here's a particle and here's a particle and when one moves this one moves but it's instantaneous and so here's this one and this one is moving in complementary to this one and as this one moves this one moves so if this one's up this one's down or vice versa and einstein called it spooky action at a distance because he's standing there thinking if they're if they're so far apart then light would have to tr how do they how do they communicate how is that one communicating with that one and why is this one in complementary to that one neil niels bohr the danish physicist who uh we all know from the bohr model of the atom him and einstein had a debate they would debate on on these on these these and and nils finally told einstein he said he said the problem is you're approaching it the wrong way he said when you see those two he said they're not two he said because when they become what we call entangled he said now you're seeing one and he said it doesn't matter where this one is or where this one is this one's going to move in complementary to that one and no matter how far apart they are they they work in continuity and they couldn't figure that one out and even today dr richard uh feinstein who's an american physicist his great quote is if you if you think you understand quantum mechanics you don't understand quantum mechanics but science is they they're they can they look at something and how in the world the two objects can be so far apart these two particles but they've they've entered into a relationship there's something that's happened to them and really they don't understand how it happens but they can look and see the effects of it and all of a sudden this and neil's board told albert he said he said you're looking at it wrong he said that's not two objects that's one he said when you see the he said when you see one you see the other and jesus said when you see man you sing the father and here's one and here's the other and jesus said i he said what i said well i do nothing of myself but what i see the father do that through the son likewise and so when he's seeing one and they're moving in what jesus didn't have his own thought but he moved in complimentary to the father and he moved and he done what the father had for him to do and so we said we see all these great things and and we see how people are standing there trying to figure that one out why how does that take place he said well we broke into eternity and we're standing there looking at that and they can't figure that out and brother sisters i want to share with you one thing tonight if that don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl i hope so i i may be the only person in the building that feels that way but i i do but why because you know that proves that proves god and here's the bride in christ as one when he said you see one you've seen the other in the book of revelation you don't see one without the other one and so here's one he's like here's the other and science is trying to figure out how did that work one because it's one it's god right as it works as one and he said don't you understand that when when you move and you and you walk and the things that you do and all the things that you do that's the that's expression of the attributes of god when you understand who you are what god's called you to you're not you're not just when you understand you know i'm i'm not i'm not the son of dale and diane roberts but i'm a son of god then i understand that you know where i come from and that's where i'm going then you know what what god has called me to is to see where i came from and then you know what i work in continuity with him i'm working complementary with him the word has come to me to make the word manifest all that god was he poured into
