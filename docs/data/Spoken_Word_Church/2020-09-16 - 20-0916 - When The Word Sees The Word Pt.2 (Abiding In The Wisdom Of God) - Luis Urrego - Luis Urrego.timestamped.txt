[2:44] scriptures this afternoon i'd like to uh
[2:46] uh turn if you turn with me to first
[2:48] corinthians chapter two
[2:50] first corinthians chapter two
[2:53] and uh we're gonna we're gonna continue
[2:57] with a
[2:57] little thought that we we had last last
[3:00] time that we preached
[3:01] when the word sees the word this is part
[3:03] two
[3:04] and we're going to talk a little bit
[3:05] about the wisdom of god amen
[3:07] abiding in the wisdom of god and so uh
[3:10] this uh
[3:11] you know the scripture talks of some
[3:12] things here regarding the wisdom of god
[3:14] but it it
[3:15] uh it's very interesting very
[3:17] interesting what the word says about it
[3:19] so uh
[3:20] so let's just let's just go let's just
[3:22] go to the lord in prayer first and then
[3:24] we'll read the word
[3:25] our heavenly father we thank you once
[3:26] again one for your the opportunity to
[3:29] open back the pages of your word lord
[3:31] we would just ask you now father god
[3:33] that you would have your will in your
[3:34] way in this
[3:35] in this hour lord father it's our it's
[3:37] our lot
[3:38] lord to speak your word when we ask
[3:40] father that you would just use my lips
[3:42] lord to say
[3:43] exactly what the people need father god
[3:45] and not necessarily
[3:46] what i want to say but what you want to
[3:48] say lord anoint my lips
[3:50] so the lord god almighty you would speak
[3:52] exactly according to your oracles
[3:54] father uh bless those that are not here
[3:57] all the needs they were mentioned lord
[3:58] brother joe
[3:59] and and and richard's mom lord god and

[4:04] know all of them lord every detail
[4:06] father god you knew that even before the
[4:08] foundation of the world lord
[4:09] and so we ask you father that you'd come
[4:11] down and be with
[4:12] with meet these needs lord and father
[4:15] god raise those that need father god
[4:17] this special touch from you
[4:19] lord we commit the rest of the service
[4:20] now into your hands thank you father for
[4:22] all your blessings in jesus christ's
[4:24] name
[4:25] amen all right
[4:28] we're going to read this this this whole
[4:30] chapter and i'll just read it
[4:31] real we'll try to go real quick and then
[4:33] we'll be seated so
[4:34] um first corinthians chapter 2 and our
[4:37] brethren when i came to you came not
[4:38] with the
[4:39] with excellency of speech or of wisdom
[4:42] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[4:44] for i determined not to know anything
[4:46] among you save jesus christ and him
[4:48] crucified
[4:50] and i was with you in weakness and in
[4:53] fear
[4:53] and in much trembling and my speech
[4:57] and my preaching was not with enticing
[4:59] words of man's wisdom
[5:01] but in demonstration of the spirit
[5:05] and of power they meant that your faith
[5:08] should not stand
[5:09] in the wisdom of man but
[5:12] in the power of god amen that's where we
[5:16] want to be
[5:16] amen praise god how be it we speak
[5:20] wisdom among them that are perfect
[5:24] yet not the wisdom of this world nor
[5:27] of the princes of this world that come
[5:30] to not
[5:31] in other words that they they're not
[5:32] going to be all the wisdom
[5:34] all the books that you see in the in the
[5:36] library and everything eventually
[5:38] that will not come to be the only wisdom
[5:40] that will stand is the word of god
[5:42] amen praise god so how important it is
[5:44] to have that word in you
[5:45] already amen that's the wisdom that we
[5:48] want praise god
[5:49] but we speak verse 7 but we speak listen
[5:52] to this but we speak the wisdom of god
[5:54] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[5:58] which god ordained watch before the
[6:01] world
[6:02] unto our glory amen i like that
[6:06] which none of the princess of this world
[6:08] knew
[6:10] for had they known it they would not
[6:12] have crucified the lord of glory
[6:15] but that is it but as it is written i
[6:18] hath not seen
[6:19] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[6:22] the heart of man
[6:23] the things which god hath prepared for
[6:26] them
[6:27] that love him amen but god hath revealed
[6:31] them
[6:31] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[6:35] searcheth all things yea the deep
[6:39] things of god amen if you have the
[6:42] spirit in you amen
[6:43] you're going to want to thirst more and
[6:45] more for this word
[6:47] amen not just be satisfied with one
[6:49] portion
[6:51] you want the whole counsel of god amen
[6:54] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[6:57] save the spirit of a man which is in him
[7:00] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[7:04] but the spirit of god so you're going to
[7:07] know the things of
[7:08] of man because you're the natural man
[7:10] that's all he knows
[7:12] right but when you have the spirit of
[7:14] god in you amen it's going to lead you
[7:16] to the word
[7:17] amen praise god now we have
[7:20] received not the spirit of the world but
[7:22] the spirit which is of god
[7:24] that we might know the things that are
[7:26] freely given
[7:27] to us of god and remember it were given
[7:29] to us even on before the foundation of
[7:32] the world
[7:32] amen in him what
[7:35] which things also we speak not in the
[7:38] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[7:40] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[7:42] comparing spiritual things
[7:44] with spiritual but the natural man
[7:46] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[7:48] of god
[7:49] for they are foolishness unto him
[7:51] neither can he know them
[7:52] because they are spiritually discerned
[7:55] but he that is spiritual
[7:57] judgeth all things
[8:00] amen i think that's important but he
[8:02] that is spiritual
[8:03] judgeth all things in other words you'll
[8:07] have the wisdom
[8:08] to judge all things
[8:12] yet he himself is judged of no man
[8:15] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[8:18] that he may instruct him
[8:20] in other words who you do you know god
[8:24] enough do you know the mind of the lord
[8:26] for you to tell him what to do
[8:30] you see but now watch what watch what
[8:32] paul says here but we have the mind of
[8:34] christ
[8:36] amen praise god you may be seated amen
[8:44] now so
[8:48] we're just going to do just a little bit
[8:50] of review here but
[8:52] i wanted to i wanted to just uh
[8:55] just hit up on uh just a few of these
[8:57] verses here that we just read real quick
[9:00] verse seven but we speak the wisdom of
[9:02] god
[9:03] no actually verse six how be it we speak
[9:06] wisdom
[9:06] among them that are perfect amen so
[9:10] paul here we see that paul here was
[9:12] differentiating between the wisdom of
[9:14] man
[9:15] and the wisdom of god so there is two
[9:17] different wisdoms amen
[9:19] there is the wisdom that you obtain by
[9:21] studying by by
[9:22] by reading uh uh as far as natural books
[9:26] going to school and all these things
[9:28] which will lead you to to the things of
[9:31] the world in order for you to get a job
[9:33] and all
[9:33] and all these things nothing wrong with
[9:35] that as long as those things are not
[9:37] taking you away from god amen
[9:40] away from the wisdom of god nothing
[9:43] wrong with that whatsoever as a matter
[9:44] of fact if you can have the wisdom of
[9:46] god in your life the holy spirit in your
[9:48] life and be at school
[9:49] and be a a a witness to uh go
[9:52] go to school go go get an education and
[9:55] all these things
[9:55] i praise god amen i believe these
[9:58] colleges need it
[10:00] amen but but but most of most
[10:04] of the time what happens is that we so
[10:06] easily get
[10:07] called into the wisdom of the world to
[10:09] the wisdom of man
[10:11] and easily start forgetting about the
[10:13] wisdom of god
[10:14] now the reason why i'm talking about the
[10:16] wisdom in in in
[10:18] it's because i'm contemplating on on
[10:21] hopefully
[10:21] maybe doing a series maybe on the book
[10:23] of proverbs
[10:25] and the book of proverbs is amen is the
[10:27] whole book about wisdom
[10:30] amen and it's not it's not it's it's
[10:33] it's spiritual wisdom but this is what i
[10:35] want to try to lead to is spiritual
[10:37] wisdom in order to help you
[10:39] with natural wisdom as well it it leads
[10:41] you to think
[10:42] amen in a in a more wise manner but that
[10:45] wisdom is tied to god's holy spirit
[10:48] amen in other words you must have the
[10:51] holy spirit of god in your life in order
[10:53] to act wisely
[10:55] fool wisely amen you cannot do it
[10:58] without a spirit sure you can do it with
[11:00] the with the wisdom
[11:01] uh uh uh you can get get by with your
[11:03] own wisdom
[11:04] the wisdom of man but amen we must as
[11:06] christians have the wisdom of god amen
[11:09] in order for us to live out the
[11:11] christian life the way we
[11:13] we we should amen we can't do it without
[11:15] christ
[11:16] without him we can do nothing without
[11:18] him we
[11:19] think that we are going the right way
[11:21] there is a way that a man
[11:23] thinks that that is right that he should
[11:24] go the bible says
[11:27] every one of us have been that way but
[11:29] most of the time we always make the
[11:31] wrong decision
[11:32] and it leads us to death amen so we want
[11:35] to
[11:35] we want to go by the wisdom of god so
[11:37] howbeit we speak
[11:39] wisdom among them that are perfect amen
[11:42] are you perfect in this hour you're
[11:44] perfect that amen
[11:45] in your soul if you were born again amen
[11:48] so
[11:49] if it it that's who paul is speaking
[11:51] about amen
[11:52] so to us who are perfect that's who that
[11:55] wisdom
[11:56] resonates to amen it doesn't resonate to
[11:58] the world because the world knows
[12:00] nothing about that wisdom
[12:01] amen it doesn't it sounds like like a
[12:03] bunch of noise to them
[12:05] it makes them what it it it doesn't it
[12:07] doesn't concord
[12:08] a naturally to what the way they reason
[12:12] things out because it's foolishness to
[12:13] them
[12:14] as paul was here mentioning you see so
[12:16] to us
[12:17] though this we speak this wisdom among
[12:19] them that are perfect
[12:21] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[12:23] the princes of this world
[12:25] that come to not in other words you have
[12:27] to realize that everything that we see
[12:29] here in this
[12:30] we are living in satan's eden in this
[12:32] hour
[12:33] everything that's going on going on
[12:35] right now i was talking to brother joe
[12:37] at work this afternoon
[12:38] you see all these wildfires you see
[12:40] hurricanes you see coronavirus you see
[12:42] uh black live matters uh protesting and
[12:45] and all these things going on everywhere
[12:47] is
[12:47] just coming up on us on us more and more
[12:50] and more and more squeezing pressuring
[12:52] amen why because this is satan's eden
[12:56] amen and obviously the word of god needs
[12:59] to be fulfilled
[13:00] but this is satan's eden this is satan's
[13:01] playground
[13:03] so that's fine he's doing what he wants
[13:05] to do he's doing what he needs to do
[13:07] amen he hates the image of god which is
[13:09] in us
[13:10] amen he hates that so he's trying to do
[13:13] everything he can to destroy that image
[13:15] to mar
[13:16] that image amen he hates that
[13:19] therefore that's why we see the things
[13:21] that we are seeing in this hour amen
[13:23] amen so to us it's no surprise
[13:27] we're we don't you know we we're we
[13:30] don't fight against flesh and blood but
[13:31] against powers and principalities
[13:34] in the air spiritual powers that's who
[13:36] we fight
[13:37] amen but satan would want us to fight
[13:39] one another
[13:41] and look at each other as the enemy
[13:44] instead of looking at him
[13:46] instead of looking at spiritual
[13:49] spiritual uh
[13:50] uh demons amen what is that noise
[13:55] anyways boo devil
[13:57] [Laughter]
[13:59] amen i hear some some noise or something
[14:01] going on over here
[14:02] anyways so you see um
[14:07] so that's that's what we need that's
[14:09] what we need to be fighting in this hour
[14:10] now verse 7 says but we speak the wisdom
[14:12] of god
[14:13] in a mystery amen that's right you see
[14:16] this is
[14:16] this this wisdom is a mystery amen to to
[14:19] to the world amen
[14:21] amen and it's a mystery to you if you
[14:23] don't have god in your life
[14:25] it's it this wisdom is the word of god
[14:29] amen and and and to you when you don't
[14:32] have that word
[14:32] inside of you it's a mystery it's a
[14:35] total mystery to you
[14:36] amen but god i believe has opened this
[14:38] thing to us in this hour amen
[14:40] i believe that god it's open it's an
[14:43] open book
[14:45] so it's it's if you want to take it and
[14:47] read it and apply it but it's a total
[14:49] open book
[14:50] the seals have been open everything's
[14:52] open amen
[14:53] so there's no excuse in this hour for
[14:55] you not to receive
[14:56] amen glory even the hidden wisdom
[15:00] which god ordained before the world unto
[15:03] our glory amen
[15:05] amen that's the hidden wisdom now that
[15:07] wisdom amen was with god
[15:09] even before the foundation of the world
[15:11] the bible says we'll look into that here
[15:12] in just a moment
[15:14] amen but we know that what was with god
[15:16] before the foundation of the world well
[15:18] i mean we know that he's eternal life
[15:20] amen he is life he is light as we've
[15:23] been talking about lately and brother
[15:24] wade's been bringing out lately he is
[15:26] that light he is that light that that
[15:28] life
[15:29] amen he is all in all amen wisdom
[15:32] knowledge power
[15:33] everything is in there amen that's the
[15:35] reason why the world
[15:36] is the way it is amen
[15:39] all that and so that's why we want so
[15:42] we want to have that with that power in
[15:45] us that eternal life in us in order for
[15:47] us to
[15:48] partake of that wisdom amen that wisdom
[15:51] of god
[15:52] amen which is a mystery to the world
[15:54] right but it shouldn't be a mystery for
[15:56] the bride amen
[15:57] which none of the princes of this world
[15:59] knew for had they known it
[16:02] they would not have crucified the lord
[16:04] of glory
[16:05] amen had they known who christ really
[16:07] was
[16:09] the power that that that he was god in
[16:12] flesh
[16:14] that he was the one that they were
[16:16] worshiping
[16:18] that they would not have crucified him
[16:21] amen
[16:22] and sometimes do we know amen what we
[16:24] really
[16:25] who we really are
[16:32] the speak the
[16:37] right here
[16:40] by the stool oh okay
[16:45] there you go
[16:51] well we had to deal with something
[16:53] physical there but
[16:55] satan was over there rubbing that thing
[16:56] back in
[17:00] i knew i was lit hearing something thank
[17:01] you sisters
[17:05] amen praise god so
[17:09] um now where was i i lost my train of
[17:13] thought
[17:14] so we we see that this wisdom amen
[17:17] the god the the people would not have
[17:20] crucified
[17:20] jesus if they had known who he really
[17:22] was amen
[17:24] amen so now we and we can just read that
[17:28] we can read that you can read that uh
[17:30] again another time but that's a that's a
[17:32] very uh
[17:33] uh the rest of that chapter amen now
[17:35] let's look at let's look at this quote
[17:37] here the brothers can
[17:38] can bring this quote we read this quote
[17:39] last time and so
[17:41] um it's an excellent quote uh brother
[17:45] branham says this here in the church age
[17:47] book down through the centuries we could
[17:49] go
[17:50] we find a moses a jeremiah a john the
[17:53] baptist
[17:55] and each one of these were god's eternal
[17:57] thoughts
[17:58] expressed in its season
[18:01] amen they did their part they weren't
[18:04] speaking of themselves
[18:05] they were they were prophesying speaking
[18:07] of the coming messiah of the word amen
[18:09] that was to be expressed
[18:11] in other words what brother branham says
[18:12] building the body of christ
[18:14] amen and then he came forth
[18:17] later on but that word needed to be
[18:19] expressed by them first or needed to be
[18:21] be spoken amen then we come to jesus
[18:25] the logos he was the perfect
[18:29] and complete thought expressed
[18:32] and he became known as the word
[18:36] that is what he is and forever will be
[18:40] amen so uh that because he's the same
[18:44] yesterday today and forever amen
[18:46] now it says that he have chosen us in
[18:49] him
[18:50] jesus watch now now that he has chosen
[18:53] us in him
[18:54] and jesus before the foundation of the
[18:57] world
[18:58] amen before the foundation of the world
[19:02] now when was this wisdom ordained unto
[19:04] us
[19:05] before the foundation of the world right
[19:08] that means that we were right there with
[19:11] him
[19:12] in the mind see if we stop if we just
[19:16] stop right there
[19:17] right there with him amen you'll get a
[19:19] lot of glory hallelujahs by that
[19:22] people will be shouting jumping yeah i
[19:24] was right there with him but
[19:26] but brother brown said that you were not
[19:27] there physically
[19:29] brother branham makes it clear where you
[19:31] were at you were right there with him
[19:34] in the mind and thoughts
[19:37] of god before the foundation of the
[19:40] world but that doesn't that doesn't
[19:42] bring down the the power
[19:45] a man that lays within you when you
[19:47] receive a man
[19:48] that eternal life amen that that dwelled
[19:51] with god even then
[19:52] you see amen that doesn't diminish that
[19:55] power
[19:57] amen that's the same power amen
[20:00] it's the same eternal life
[20:03] that means that we were right there with
[20:05] him in the mind and thoughts of god
[20:06] before the foundation of the world
[20:08] now watch that gives an eternal
[20:11] quality to the elect amen
[20:15] that gives an eternal quality to the
[20:17] elect but you still came here as a
[20:20] sinner
[20:22] but that but the election had already
[20:24] taken place
[20:26] in the mind of god by foreknowledge amen
[20:28] predestination by foreknowledge
[20:31] amen that is what gave you that
[20:34] that that eternal quality amen amen
[20:37] praise god you can't get away from that
[20:42] there's no way that you can get away
[20:43] from that amen
[20:46] god saw it before the foundation of the
[20:48] world therefore you have to come to it
[20:51] you have to come to there's no way that
[20:53] you cannot god
[20:54] god makes no mistakes he's perfect in
[20:57] all his ways
[20:58] everything he knew everything that he
[21:00] knows everything that
[21:02] that he that he will i mean he doesn't
[21:04] learn
[21:05] nothing he just knows amen praise god
[21:08] and he knew what you needed amen he knew
[21:11] that you were going to come
[21:12] and receive this word amen at the
[21:15] particular time
[21:16] that you did receive it amen amen
[21:19] praise god not one minute less not one
[21:21] minute more
[21:23] amen amen praise god that's how exact in
[21:26] in in that he is praise god
[21:30] amen so that gives an eternal quality to
[21:33] the elect ephesians 1
[21:35] chapter 1 verses 3 and 5 blessed be the
[21:37] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[21:39] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[21:41] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[21:45] according as he hath chosen us in him
[21:48] before the foundation of the world again
[21:50] when was this wisdom
[21:52] also uh uh granted unto us before the
[21:55] foundation of the world amen
[21:57] praise god yeah i'll keep saying that
[21:59] because i want you to tie this wisdom to
[22:01] that life
[22:02] amen to that eternal life that we should
[22:05] be holy
[22:06] and without blame before him
[22:09] in love look at all these things that
[22:12] god predestinated us to be
[22:14] i'm just reading here everything that he
[22:17] saw about you
[22:19] but everything that you see when you
[22:20] look at yourself in the mirror and satan
[22:23] says to you the opposite
[22:24] you don't believe that you just take
[22:26] them back to the word and say this is
[22:28] how god saw me
[22:29] and this is how i accept it this is how
[22:32] i i
[22:33] see it and this is how i'm going to
[22:34] receive it and you just step right into
[22:36] it amen
[22:37] and you watch that manifest more in your
[22:39] life do you know that science says that
[22:42] whatever i mean just in the physical
[22:45] there's people that have been healed of
[22:46] cancer not even christians
[22:48] cancer and in in different diseases just
[22:51] by
[22:52] just by positive confessions
[22:56] by what you train your mind amen amen
[23:00] to to to to say about yourself amen
[23:02] that's right
[23:03] remember everything that's negative that
[23:05] and teenagers especially they they
[23:08] they battle with this they're in a very
[23:10] unstable area
[23:12] a part of their life and so satan
[23:15] uses that on instability to really
[23:18] attack them
[23:20] and so when they look at themselves in
[23:21] the mirror and see that pimple on their
[23:23] face
[23:23] or see the the the different changes
[23:25] that are taking place in their life
[23:27] that's when he goes on will you look how
[23:29] ugly you are
[23:31] oh look look at that nasty old black zit
[23:35] all along the tip of your nose
[23:37] and he just keeps hammering at you and
[23:39] keeps hammering oh it's so
[23:40] ugly you know now it's worse now because
[23:43] well at least i could cover it up with a
[23:45] mask now
[23:50] see but that's what satan that satan
[23:53] wants to do amen but
[23:54] you just take satan back to the word and
[23:56] he can't say nothing about that
[23:58] amen now you're seeing yourself like
[24:01] this right now amen but look how god saw
[24:04] you even before there was anything on
[24:05] the world
[24:07] before there was anything in the world
[24:09] god saw you perfect
[24:10] amen amen praise god take him take
[24:14] take i'd rather take what god said about
[24:17] me amen then what
[24:18] so anything negative that comes at you
[24:20] amen you can certainly
[24:21] you certainly know it's not from god
[24:24] any condemnation that comes in your life
[24:26] you can certainly know that it's not of
[24:28] god
[24:29] amen because there is now no
[24:30] condemnation to them that are in christ
[24:33] jesus
[24:34] to them that are in christ jesus amen no
[24:36] condemnation whatsoever
[24:38] praise god if there is that means
[24:41] satan's hanging around somewhere
[24:42] lurking around amen and you better watch
[24:45] you better watch
[24:46] amen according as he has chosen us in
[24:49] him before the foundation of the world
[24:51] that we should be holy and without blame
[24:54] before him in love
[24:56] hallelujah amen having predestinated us
[24:59] unto the adoption of children
[25:02] by jesus christ to himself according to
[25:05] the good pleasure of his will amen
[25:07] now how did he predestinate us
[25:10] i'm going to take a swig of water while
[25:12] someone says it
[25:18] yeah that's right for knowledge by his
[25:20] foreknowledge that's how he
[25:22] predestinated us amen
[25:23] because he knew therefore he could
[25:25] predestinate
[25:27] amen praise god not anything that you
[25:29] did
[25:30] there's nothing that you could have done
[25:33] no
[25:33] there's nothing it's because he knew
[25:36] that it was going to be therefore he
[25:38] could bring that word
[25:39] across in your life amen and he knew
[25:42] that that's what you would receive amen
[25:45] therefore you are where you are now have
[25:48] you ever stopped
[25:49] and thought about how it is that you got
[25:51] to where you are now
[25:54] amen i i think about my way the way the
[25:57] way that god
[25:58] just just led me to even even know about
[26:01] the message
[26:02] and one of the one of the things was
[26:05] when i was in columbia south america
[26:07] when i was a baptist at the time i was
[26:08] 19 years old
[26:10] and in 1999 which was when i was when i
[26:13] was 19
[26:14] i uh uh we we started
[26:17] we started uh uh uh visiting a message
[26:20] church there this was we're already
[26:22] living here but this was the first time
[26:23] i went back to south america
[26:25] to visit since i had come here to the
[26:27] united states i had not been
[26:29] back to the country in 11 years and and
[26:32] a brother gave us a a message book
[26:35] it was it was uh christ the mystery of
[26:38] god revealed
[26:39] and it was in spanish but i went in
[26:41] there in a little room in my in my
[26:43] aunt's house
[26:44] and started reading that little book
[26:47] and one of the questions that i had
[26:49] always had in my mind
[26:51] throughout my childhood throughout my
[26:52] teenage years and
[26:54] as as a christian nominal christian amen
[26:57] is
[26:57] lord why is it that we live here on this
[27:00] earth
[27:01] knowing that you you knew that we were
[27:04] going to sin
[27:05] you knew that we were gonna we were
[27:07] gonna come into this condition that
[27:09] mankind was gonna be in this terrible
[27:11] horrible condition that they find
[27:13] themselves in
[27:14] and why is it that you allowed it why
[27:20] and out of all the 1100 messages that
[27:22] that that i could have picked up
[27:25] i picked that one right because in that
[27:28] one
[27:29] is where brother branham talks about
[27:32] later around uh later on in that book is
[27:34] where he talks about
[27:35] that if there was no no uh if there was
[27:38] nobody to be saved amen
[27:41] then he could not present his his
[27:44] him being a savior or his attributes if
[27:47] there was nobody
[27:48] sick he could not show forth that he was
[27:50] a healer right
[27:52] and and when i read that i mean
[27:55] something just sparked in me i
[27:57] i got out of the bed i ran i said i
[28:00] cannot believe that i jumped out of the
[28:02] bed
[28:02] ran out the door and my mom was over
[28:04] there washing dishes
[28:06] or washing some clothes with my aunt and
[28:08] i was sitting there mom look what i was
[28:09] reading
[28:10] look what i read look what i read and i
[28:11] was trying to tell her i was so excited
[28:13] about what i just read
[28:14] and of course my mom you know she was
[28:16] kind of busy and stuff i said okay well
[28:17] forget it now just went back
[28:19] sat back down and continued reading
[28:21] glory
[28:22] and that right there just really sparked
[28:24] something in me it was the word that i
[28:26] needed a man to draw me to the word amen
[28:31] now brother branham spoke that not maybe
[28:34] not thinking
[28:35] you know that that would be in existence
[28:37] but he thought it
[28:40] glory the lord thought it and that is
[28:43] what i needed to draw me
[28:45] amen to this word from then on amen
[28:49] it was it was me after that you know
[28:51] seeking more what about what the message
[28:53] was about amen
[28:54] and i took i took it in wholeheartedly
[28:56] amen and i and i and i pray that
[28:59] god keeps me that way amen praise god
[29:04] but it was some it was something so god
[29:05] knew what you needed amen to draw you to
[29:08] this word
[29:10] he had that word prepared for you he had
[29:12] that exact word
[29:14] for you amen prepared for it
[29:17] so now let's read this this quote here
[29:20] uh
[29:20] because last time we talked about
[29:22] representation from predestination
[29:24] and let's just review that here just a
[29:26] moment let's read this quote here
[29:28] proving his word brother branham says
[29:30] this here he the here he's speaking
[29:32] about the
[29:33] the woman at the well the incident that
[29:36] took place there between christ and the
[29:38] woman at the well
[29:40] he says here why he said you've told
[29:42] you've told the truth
[29:43] see because you've had five and the one
[29:46] you now have
[29:47] is not your husband all right
[29:51] now see that is the word that she needed
[29:54] to hear
[29:56] she needed that word she needed that was
[29:59] what was going to draw her attention
[30:01] amen because
[30:02] when we look at the story we we we see
[30:05] that
[30:06] she said sir uh uh we know that
[30:09] when messiah cometh he'll tell us these
[30:11] things amen
[30:13] and of course jesus says i'm he that
[30:14] speaks with you so she knew she'd had
[30:17] the word already
[30:18] spoken to her because she said we know
[30:20] that messiah when he comes he'll tell us
[30:22] these things
[30:23] she had been told i think maybe brother
[30:25] branham might have said this i could i
[30:26] don't know
[30:27] but he might she might have she grew up
[30:29] her mom may be teaching her about the
[30:31] word and
[30:32] and and ta and they would hear the
[30:34] scribes
[30:35] and they would hear the priests and
[30:37] stuff get up and talk the words she
[30:39] had been taught the word but now here is
[30:41] the living word before her
[30:43] speaking the word that she needed to
[30:45] hear in order for that word amen to
[30:47] respond
[30:48] amen that representation amen
[30:51] and so brother obama says here see watch
[30:54] something happened see something took
[30:57] life now if it hadn't been
[31:01] in there to begin with
[31:04] let's see if we put a period right there
[31:07] it sounds like there was something in
[31:10] her
[31:11] physically that took life
[31:15] but that's not what it what it says it
[31:17] says now if it hadn't been
[31:18] in there to begin with watch if she
[31:20] hadn't have had
[31:22] representation from predestination
[31:25] and remember last time we were talking
[31:27] about it it's pr representation from
[31:29] predestination
[31:30] and the foreknowledge of god amen
[31:33] because that's where the predestination
[31:35] took place
[31:36] in god's foreknowledge amen so see
[31:39] in god's foreknowledge he saw that woman
[31:42] at the well
[31:43] amen responding to what jesus was saying
[31:46] to her there at the well
[31:48] therefore that if god could present that
[31:51] word before her and she could respond
[31:53] appropriately
[31:54] amen praise god aren't you glad that you
[31:58] serve a god
[31:59] that knows all things that's why he is
[32:01] the god of
[32:02] all wisdom so much different from the
[32:05] wisdom of the world
[32:07] and in the wisdom in the wisdom of god
[32:09] amen amen
[32:11] and that's why we need to look into the
[32:14] wisdom of god
[32:16] if she hadn't have had representation
[32:18] from predestination
[32:19] it had never took hold right that's
[32:22] right
[32:24] because god saw it
[32:29] therefore it must need it to take place
[32:32] amen
[32:34] and god doesn't make mistakes amen
[32:36] praise god
[32:37] their stood priests there said this man
[32:40] is
[32:41] above see no representation
[32:44] amen god didn't see that amen there was
[32:47] they god did not see them except in him
[32:50] when the word come
[32:51] can't come through now correct me if i'm
[32:54] wrong
[32:56] brothers but he did not therefore that's
[32:58] why they could not respond to that word
[33:00] amen
[33:02] now the priests those priests they were
[33:04] in the mind of god
[33:06] they were in the mind of god judas was
[33:08] in the mind of god
[33:10] cain was in the mind of god uh hitler
[33:13] was in the mind of god
[33:15] everybody was in the mind of god amen
[33:18] but only some amen were predestinated by
[33:21] his foreknowledge amen to come to the
[33:23] knowledge of this word amen
[33:25] see and so that's why that's why it said
[33:28] that i just don't want to be in the mind
[33:29] of god
[33:30] that's right because cain was in the
[33:32] mind of god
[33:34] judas was in the mind of god hitler was
[33:36] in the mind of god
[33:38] all these people amen they have
[33:39] committed atrocities amen
[33:41] throughout the world they're in the mind
[33:43] of god amen amen
[33:46] but there's a predestination of you amen
[33:48] praise god
[33:49] they were that god saw amen when that
[33:52] word my word comes across
[33:54] them they're going to receive it they're
[33:55] going to accept it amen
[33:58] praise god eternal life now watch this
[34:01] eternal life you always was
[34:06] see now you could take that a different
[34:08] way
[34:10] it's very easy see you see how people
[34:12] could say
[34:13] uh people in the message in the message
[34:16] ranks they could say you've always been
[34:18] eternal
[34:20] not you physically amen i don't know
[34:23] the eternal life has always been eternal
[34:26] amen the life has always been into god's
[34:28] lone life has always been eternal amen
[34:31] and if you were predestinated in there
[34:34] amen
[34:35] then yeah you're eternal amen when you
[34:37] receive the new birth
[34:39] praise god eternal life you always was
[34:42] see you have
[34:43] eternal life there's only one form of it
[34:46] that's god amen you were his
[34:50] attribute he thought of you
[34:53] and knowed you before the foundation of
[34:56] the world
[34:57] where in his mind
[35:00] amen in his mind amen
[35:03] not that you were there running around
[35:07] or that or that because then we'd go
[35:11] back to
[35:12] like pre-existence of souls and stuff
[35:14] like that
[35:15] that's that's a mormon doctrine saying
[35:17] that we had a meeting up there and
[35:19] and and that that something about satan
[35:22] was cast down we were the ones who cast
[35:24] satan down or some
[35:25] something on those lines in other words
[35:27] we were there physically and
[35:29] and so that's where it leads us to and
[35:31] we know that's anti-word amen
[35:34] that's anti-word it's not anywhere in
[35:36] the word therefore when you read these
[35:38] quotes of brother branham you have to
[35:40] make sure you take them
[35:41] back to the word they have to fit in
[35:44] with god's word
[35:46] they can't be they can't be just feel
[35:49] good things
[35:49] amen yeah it sounds so good yeah we were
[35:52] there
[35:53] amen predestinated before the foundation
[35:54] of the world running around and jumping
[35:56] and screaming and shouting
[35:58] that sounds so good that causes for a
[36:00] good uh
[36:01] meeting to jump run around
[36:04] as we probably have seen in the past
[36:07] but that doesn't bring understanding
[36:10] therefore doesn't bring
[36:11] revelation right now if you have the rev
[36:15] the right revelation about that and you
[36:17] jump and shout and scream amen praise
[36:19] god
[36:20] amen but just because amen sometimes
[36:24] uh if you know big name preacher amen
[36:27] brings those things and it makes you
[36:28] jump shout and feel good
[36:30] and scream amen without no real true
[36:33] revelation
[36:34] of what is said or what brother branham
[36:36] was really trying to say
[36:38] then then it's not it's not doing what
[36:40] what it's intending to do
[36:42] you see that's right amen
[36:46] and so we also looked at last time that
[36:48] the descript that the word
[36:49] representation
[36:50] means this is one of the best one uh
[36:54] uh meanings that i could find it's the
[36:56] description or portrayal of someone
[36:59] or something in a particular way or as
[37:02] being of a certain nature
[37:04] amen so you are and you're standing
[37:08] where you are amen because god saw that
[37:11] before the foundation of the world in
[37:13] his mind
[37:14] amen he knew that you would be that way
[37:17] he knew that you would
[37:18] be who you are amen and would be uh
[37:21] receive the word the way you receive it
[37:23] amen right
[37:26] because he he had it portrayed in his
[37:29] mind
[37:30] it was like he was watching a film amen
[37:33] in his mind about your life
[37:36] about how you were going to receive his
[37:38] word his eternal life
[37:40] amen praise god he knew all of that amen
[37:43] amen i invite you that if you haven't
[37:46] received that amen if you haven't
[37:47] received that word that eternal life
[37:49] amen in your life
[37:50] yeah praise god right now is the time to
[37:53] do it
[37:54] don't wait don't wait till the
[37:56] coronavirus stuff gets worse
[37:58] and and then when i see things getting
[38:00] worse and when i
[38:01] really i mean when i see things it could
[38:04] just be too late then
[38:06] don't don't my mom always told me my dad
[38:09] always told me
[38:09] don't wait to do tomorrow what you can
[38:11] do today
[38:13] because you don't have tomorrow promised
[38:15] amen
[38:16] i go back to you know you know telling
[38:19] you things
[38:20] uh as such but then also try to bring
[38:22] them the way that you can
[38:24] you can you can grasp onto them as well
[38:26] you see because
[38:27] uh uh you know sometimes we might think
[38:30] oh well
[38:32] this is just too too deep and too hard
[38:34] for me to
[38:35] amen but but in reality it's all tied
[38:38] into just
[38:39] having christ in your life to change
[38:42] your life
[38:43] amen to live a christ-like life
[38:46] amen it's christ in you the hope of
[38:49] glory
[38:51] that's what that's that's that's what it
[38:53] all boils down to
[38:54] and that's the mystery that satan
[38:56] doesn't understand
[38:59] he doesn't understand the mystery of the
[39:01] of the spirit of god
[39:04] living in a human being like you and
[39:06] doing the great things
[39:08] amen that he did he doesn't understand
[39:12] that
[39:12] that's why we were that's why brother
[39:14] wade and brother dale been speaking
[39:15] about
[39:16] how it's tying in to why satan
[39:19] got so mad and though and acted the way
[39:22] he acted towards god
[39:24] why because here he's he's uh and
[39:26] brother
[39:27] i like what brother dale was bringing
[39:28] about about michael
[39:30] here's michael we know that michael is
[39:32] christ amen
[39:33] and here's michael amen and he gets
[39:36] upset
[39:37] at that but then here comes and god
[39:40] creates amen the human being
[39:42] a man in his own image in his likeness
[39:47] satan's really really hating that image
[39:50] amen that's the reason why he's marring
[39:53] and hating the image of of humans
[39:55] even in this hour amen yeah
[39:58] and uh and and going from abortions to
[40:01] pedophiles and all these types of things
[40:03] that we see
[40:04] that's trying to destroy human life
[40:08] amen praise god
[40:13] all right so let's let's just read real
[40:15] quick genesis 1 26.
[40:20] and we all we all know the scripture
[40:23] genesis 1 20 says then god said let us
[40:25] make man in our image
[40:27] after our own likeness amen
[40:30] let us make man in our image
[40:34] after our likeness amen
[40:38] god is is god amen god is the word
[40:42] god is the logos god is eternal life
[40:46] exactly right and so if you if that
[40:49] eternal life is in you
[40:50] amen you were part of this man right
[40:52] there amen
[40:54] you're part of that man praise god
[40:58] that's why god said let us make man
[41:01] in our image it was
[41:04] that doesn't denote a trinity
[41:08] a lot of people think oh there's there's
[41:10] there's there's there's the proof that
[41:12] there's a trinity you know or or
[41:14] no amen it's just it's us
[41:17] in him praise god and us chosen in him
[41:21] amen praise god
[41:24] so when god made man amen when god
[41:27] brought adam into being amen
[41:30] and adam having that eternal life amen
[41:33] being an eternal
[41:34] eternal eternal being amen yes
[41:38] we could say that we were in there amen
[41:41] even then amen amen because we were part
[41:44] of that life
[41:45] you see so you have to see yourself less
[41:48] this way in the word
[41:49] you can't just see yourself over here
[41:52] and and god over there
[41:54] no you have to see yourself as part of
[41:56] the whole word of god
[41:58] even from the beginning amen
[42:02] and and when you see yourself that way
[42:04] it it makes you realize and helps you
[42:06] realize
[42:07] what kind of power lays into me amen
[42:11] that if i was there amen as in the in
[42:14] the and that eternal uh
[42:16] uh uh being of in that eternal life like
[42:19] adam had a man
[42:21] that same power amen that he had amen
[42:24] that could that could say anything i
[42:25] mean there was nothing that that could
[42:26] stop adam was supposed to be the god of
[42:28] this world
[42:31] take full control of the world god said
[42:33] of the earth amen and i'll and i'll
[42:35] guard heaven
[42:36] amen so how how much power lays in you
[42:40] amen
[42:41] praise god do you see what i'm trying to
[42:44] say
[42:45] with that same life it's not a different
[42:46] life that adam had
[42:49] it's the same life remember the example
[42:51] about the spoon
[42:53] the ocean water amen yes sir now we
[42:56] christ had that that that that fullness
[42:59] of the godhead bodily dwelled in him the
[43:01] fullness
[43:03] all of god amen we have it in measure
[43:06] but it's still the same quality
[43:09] it's still the same quality because it's
[43:11] the same elements
[43:12] you take a spoonful of the ocean
[43:15] amen you take that spoonful it has the
[43:19] same elements the same
[43:20] chemicals the same everything that the
[43:22] whole ocean has
[43:25] amen yeah therefore it could do just the
[43:28] same
[43:29] if you needed to if you need let's say
[43:30] for example ocean water
[43:32] kills toe fungus i don't know
[43:36] salt water amen you don't need the whole
[43:38] ocean to do it
[43:39] right amen just a little portion you see
[43:43] therefore amen it's just as powerful as
[43:46] if you had the whole ocean
[43:49] but the thing is that we could continue
[43:50] going and getting more and more
[43:53] in partaking of more and more and more
[43:55] and the word the more you partake of
[43:57] that
[43:57] ocean of the word amen the more of that
[44:00] ocean can heal you
[44:02] the more of that ocean can can save you
[44:04] the more that ocean can
[44:06] amen can just do all kinds can can
[44:08] impart wisdom to you
[44:10] you see amen praise god
[44:14] amen now let's let's touch up on this
[44:17] on this wisdom here real quick so that
[44:19] was just a little review of what we were
[44:20] talking about last
[44:22] last week amen for those maybe that that
[44:25] weren't here
[44:26] um let's look at this uh and going back
[44:29] to first corinthians chapter two verse
[44:31] six through seven how be it
[44:32] we speak wisdom among them that are
[44:35] perfect
[44:36] yet not the wisdom of this world
[44:39] nor of the princes of this world that
[44:42] come to not
[44:43] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[44:45] mystery
[44:47] even the hidden wisdom which god
[44:51] ordained before the world unto our glory
[44:54] amen praise god again god ordained this
[44:59] so god ordained us amen in him before
[45:02] the foundation of what god ordained this
[45:04] wisdom
[45:05] in amen to us before the foundation of
[45:07] the world
[45:09] amen praise god now um
[45:14] now wisdom the dictionary says about
[45:16] wisdom the the uh i don't have this here
[45:19] but
[45:19] uh but you can leave that there brother
[45:21] uh wisdom is the ability to discern
[45:24] inner qualities and relationships
[45:26] insight
[45:28] amen good sense generally
[45:31] or judgment generally accepted belief
[45:33] challenges what has become accepted
[45:35] wisdom among many historians
[45:37] accumulated philosophical or scientific
[45:40] learning
[45:41] knowledge a wise attitude belief of
[45:43] course or course of action
[45:45] the teachings of the ancient wise man
[45:48] when you look at this word wisdom in the
[45:50] new testament that paul was mentioning
[45:51] here in first corinthians chapter 2
[45:54] it's the word it's the word sophia
[45:58] oh
[46:01] and she's she's asleep so i thought
[46:04] maybe her eyes i was i was looking at
[46:06] that
[46:06] and i said when i would say sophia and i
[46:08] was just imagining her eyes get big and
[46:10] [Laughter]
[46:11] but but rachel you tell her afterwards
[46:15] i put her to sleep
[46:20] well praise god amen
[46:23] i did something
[46:24] [Laughter]
[46:26] amen it's the greek word sophia
[46:30] amen which is wisdom higher or lower
[46:33] worldly or
[46:34] spiritual wisdom amen amen so
[46:37] it's uh glory can be worldly or
[46:40] spiritual now
[46:44] so that means in in in different verses
[46:47] in the bible
[46:48] where it talks about wisdom if it's
[46:49] talking about the wisdom of man
[46:51] it could be the same word as well but
[46:53] then it could also be the same with the
[46:55] same word for the spiritual wisdom of
[46:57] god
[46:57] colossians chapter two let's read
[46:59] colossians chapter two verses one
[47:00] through
[47:01] four amen are you still with me amen i'm
[47:04] i'm gonna make sure i don't keep you
[47:06] too late tonight i wanna you don't get
[47:07] caught in the rain
[47:09] and and uh and all these things so yeah
[47:12] for i would that ye knew what great
[47:15] conflict i have for you
[47:17] and for them at laodicea
[47:21] so it's it's so interesting that paul
[47:23] here is speaking and talking about
[47:24] laodicea
[47:25] [Laughter]
[47:27] i have for you and for them at laodicea
[47:30] and for as many as have not seen my face
[47:33] in the flesh
[47:35] i just say that's you and me too you
[47:36] know i have not seen paul in the flesh
[47:39] amen and here we live in laodicea you
[47:42] know
[47:43] we know that our soul is not living in
[47:44] laodicea but
[47:46] we're here in this in our in the flesh
[47:49] that
[47:49] verse two that their hearts might be
[47:52] comforted
[47:53] being knit together in love and
[47:56] unto all riches of the full
[48:00] assurance of understanding
[48:03] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[48:06] god
[48:07] there he goes again talking about the
[48:08] mystery of god
[48:10] and of the father and of christ
[48:14] amen verse 3 in whom
[48:17] are hid all the treasures of
[48:20] wisdom and knowledge where are they
[48:24] hidden in
[48:26] amen where are those treasures hidden in
[48:29] amen amen
[48:32] that's why it's so important for us to
[48:34] be in christ
[48:35] amen and christ be in us amen
[48:39] because without that amen you would not
[48:41] have access to this wisdom
[48:44] amen and this wisdom is part of the
[48:46] eternal life of god amen
[48:49] everything amen everything is everything
[48:51] that that
[48:52] that is that is good that is just that
[48:54] is peace the power of god amen
[48:56] dwells in that eternal life amen and in
[48:59] whom our head all the treasures of
[49:00] wisdom
[49:01] and knowledge and this i say lest any
[49:04] man should beguile you with enticing
[49:06] words
[49:08] in other words paul's saying i'm telling
[49:10] you this in case a man somebody comes
[49:13] through and starts speaking to you
[49:15] enticing in his own and in his own
[49:17] wisdom
[49:18] amen try to entice you just as the
[49:20] serpent did with eve
[49:22] amen using his own wisdom use not
[49:25] used 99 word
[49:28] but it's that one percent that'll get
[49:30] you that's right
[49:32] that one percent lie that will get you
[49:36] a twist of the word because that's how
[49:39] satan can do is pervert
[49:41] he has he he's no creator he can't
[49:45] create
[49:45] he has to take what already is there and
[49:48] just twist it pervert it
[49:50] make it sound like make it sound good
[49:54] it makes it it makes it sound like it's
[49:56] something genuine
[49:58] and something oh my because it was so
[50:00] good it sounded good to eve
[50:04] made her act you see and that's how he
[50:07] gets us
[50:08] it sounds so good and so enticing and
[50:11] how could it be wrong
[50:13] it's the word but see you're seeing the
[50:16] word
[50:17] yeah but you're not seeing that one
[50:18] percent
[50:20] because you're so caught up in the
[50:21] emotion and you're so caught up in the
[50:23] in the jumping and the screaming in the
[50:25] shower you're not seeing that one
[50:26] percent
[50:27] right i remember one time i was at a
[50:30] tent meeting it was back
[50:32] when i first come into the message in
[50:34] anderson south carolina
[50:36] and uh we were there at a tent meeting
[50:38] and uh
[50:40] i had a brother's tent meeting there and
[50:43] they had a man from out west preaching
[50:45] and uh and he was just preaching
[50:49] i mean just saying things and now the
[50:51] church that i was going to at the time i
[50:53] knew that the brother didn't believe
[50:55] what they were saying at the tamp
[50:57] meeting but
[50:58] and they were just shouting and
[51:00] screaming i mean and there was people
[51:01] running up and down the platform and all
[51:03] kinds of stuff and i was
[51:06] i mean it sounded really good i mean i
[51:09] mean
[51:10] and that and my and my pastor at the
[51:12] time he was there
[51:13] and he was sitting like several rows
[51:15] behind me
[51:16] and he just tapped me on my shoulder and
[51:17] he said hey come here and he took me out
[51:20] outside and he said and he said he said
[51:22] you see all these people
[51:24] i said but that i said yeah i mean it
[51:27] sounds like they're having a
[51:28] wonderful great time i mean it i mean
[51:31] and things are taking place i mean even
[51:33] people are being healed and stuff like
[51:35] that
[51:36] but he was up there preaching contrary
[51:39] to the word of god
[51:40] i mean just just slap contrary i mean
[51:44] bring it
[51:44] you know just bringing uh you know this
[51:47] return ministry stuff
[51:48] and things like that you see i mean to
[51:51] the fullest i mean to the point of
[51:52] almost worshiping
[51:53] brother brandon right
[51:57] and and and i had heard you know i was
[52:01] i had heard that you know these you got
[52:02] to be wary of these doctrines and things
[52:04] like that
[52:05] but when you're in that atmosphere
[52:10] and you're not if you're not grounded in
[52:12] the word that one percent will get you
[52:15] it's so easy to get you amen now it's
[52:18] not for us
[52:19] amen to to act like we're better than
[52:21] them or
[52:22] or oh you know it's not that that's not
[52:25] the ad
[52:26] even the attitude that we should have
[52:27] amen amen but
[52:29] but you have to make sure where you are
[52:32] standing in the word amen
[52:35] before you say amen to something right
[52:38] amen
[52:40] you have to know i mean sometimes we
[52:42] just say amen because that's just what
[52:43] we're used to
[52:44] amen amen amen amen and the brother
[52:47] could be up there preaching
[52:48] anything and we're still saying amen
[52:51] because it's the church environment
[52:53] because it's it's it's
[52:54] the pastor saying it or or the preacher
[52:57] that
[52:58] that came for you know from another
[53:00] state to come i mean he's got to be
[53:02] right i mean he's
[53:03] he's well known around the world
[53:06] so we must but you see that's why
[53:10] you know i've i've i've learned amen
[53:12] that it's so important to
[53:13] listen amen right it's so important to
[53:16] listen and that's the reason why
[53:17] teaching is so important you see
[53:20] teaching is so important we need of
[53:21] course the evangelist to come through we
[53:23] need all those
[53:24] the five-fold ministry amen and some of
[53:27] those
[53:28] amen some of those will speak to us more
[53:30] than others
[53:32] amen but when teaching comes in amen
[53:35] usually when teaching somebody's
[53:37] teaching there's no jumping and shouting
[53:39] amen and going on
[53:41] why because we're trying to listen right
[53:44] because
[53:44] it's it's it's see satan was teaching
[53:47] eve
[53:49] right satan was teaching eve he wasn't
[53:52] he wasn't
[53:53] preaching amen he wasn't he actually had
[53:56] her in a chat room
[53:59] talking with her yeah had her in the
[54:01] chat room you know
[54:02] you know you know maybe uh facetiming
[54:06] her
[54:09] facetiming eve and uh you know just just
[54:11] chatting with her and uh
[54:13] or on a zoom call yeah
[54:16] yeah and just look just looking at just
[54:20] and he's teaching her and showing him
[54:22] showing her charts and everything
[54:24] i mean you see but she failed that
[54:27] little one percent
[54:28] that's right that little one percent
[54:30] yeah she she
[54:31] that the 99 he wasn't telling her
[54:33] everything a lie
[54:35] she she just she just fell that little
[54:37] one percent
[54:38] then put this this two and two together
[54:41] right here
[54:42] and it caused her to go to the downfall
[54:46] that we're in now
[54:48] amen so you be careful young people amen
[54:52] in your zoom calls and in your
[54:54] in your in your facetimes and in your
[54:56] facebook lives and all these things amen
[54:59] be careful the slicker could be in there
[55:02] amen oh my slicker is not uh
[55:07] brother brown called him the slicker and
[55:08] he wasn't he wasn't the ugly
[55:10] satan that brother wade has been saying
[55:12] satan is not a two-horned
[55:13] you know a long tail with a pitchfork
[55:16] and nothing like that
[55:17] he doesn't look like he doesn't look
[55:19] like uh uh uh
[55:21] you know some scary thing right no he
[55:24] looks like of somebody that's
[55:26] clean cut nice i mean dress is nice
[55:30] you know has might even have some
[55:33] sunglasses you know
[55:34] got some adidas on i mean he just looks
[55:38] cool man yeah i mean he just he looks
[55:40] like
[55:41] he fits in he always fits in
[55:46] he does it's not that he's he does i
[55:48] mean he fits in
[55:50] he knows how to talk to the girl because
[55:52] he knows how to talk to the guy to be
[55:54] able to
[55:55] amen to go with him or
[55:58] do things you see
[56:03] thinking's a slicker i don't even know
[56:05] how i'm getting to
[56:06] all this amen praise god
[56:10] but you know what i'm speaking about
[56:11] these things and maybe because
[56:13] uh you know proverbs talks about all
[56:16] these things
[56:18] you know but i wanted to delay kind of
[56:21] this foundation amen
[56:23] to show you that this wisdom amen right
[56:26] you have to have eternal wisdom in your
[56:28] life first before you can
[56:29] impart a mirror before that wisdom could
[56:31] come out of you amen
[56:33] has to be that wisdom of god amen
[56:37] praise god and this i say lest any man
[56:41] should beguile you with enticing words
[56:44] so there is a difference between earthly
[56:46] wisdom
[56:47] and heavenly wisdom all right look what
[56:49] brother branham says here
[56:51] in the message wisdom versus faith it's
[56:54] just a little
[56:54] small quote and so the wisdom that i
[56:57] want you to get straightened out
[56:59] on for before we start there is a wisdom
[57:02] of god
[57:03] a wisdom of god is stay with his word
[57:08] amen as simple as that state is his word
[57:12] but
[57:13] satan in his wisdom tried to twist the
[57:17] word
[57:18] so that's the wisdom i'm speaking of and
[57:21] so when brother brown was preaching that
[57:22] wisdom versus faith message
[57:24] he was he was he was speaking about uh
[57:28] kind of like what brother he's been
[57:29] bringing the two spirits
[57:31] you see the wisdom of man
[57:36] the wisdom of god amen versus faith
[57:40] amen praise the lord so there is a
[57:42] wisdom of god and the wisdom of god is
[57:44] stay
[57:45] with his word amen the wise man amen
[57:49] looks and sees the danger ahead amen
[57:52] sees when somebody is meant
[57:53] is off the word the the prudent man
[57:57] you see and takes and and
[58:00] takes note right amen
[58:04] but the simple just keep moving on right
[58:07] and just and just
[58:08] let themselves get hurt and then find
[58:10] themselves in a in
[58:12] a church or something like that right
[58:15] where they're just completely in a mess
[58:19] you see because why we didn't discern
[58:22] the word
[58:23] amen you see we didn't discern what was
[58:26] going forth behind from behind the
[58:28] pulpit
[58:29] we just took it because it made us feel
[58:31] good you see what i'm trying to say
[58:34] so important in this hour amen
[58:38] stay with his word so the word we know
[58:41] what is his word the word
[58:42] is jesus christ amen now if the word is
[58:46] jesus christ
[58:47] then that means this the he's the wisdom
[58:49] of god amen
[58:50] right the word is the wisdom of god amen
[58:54] amen so if you have the word in your
[58:56] soul
[58:57] by the baptism of the holy ghost it will
[59:00] impart wisdom to you
[59:02] amen you see amen

[59:47] we we think that we have the wisdom of
[59:49] god in our lives
[59:50] the holy spirit which is that wisdom
[59:54] the wisdom of god and sometimes we act
[59:57] and do
[59:58] foolish things that easily
[1:00:03] you know it's so easy amen that
[1:00:06] for us to to think that that we are
[1:00:08] right and and

[1:00:27] praise god we'll lead you to talk wisely
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:30] praise god
[1:00:34] amen so let's talk about solomon here
[1:00:36] for just a moment solomon we know that
[1:00:37] was the wisest man that ever lived
[1:00:40] on earth amen praise god he was he was
[1:00:44] the
[1:00:44] uh we know that god he was praying and
[1:00:47] and god uh in the bible and and god
[1:00:51] granted him and said
[1:00:52] ask what you wish and i would give it
[1:00:54] unto you
[1:00:56] now see solomon already had form of
[1:00:58] wisdom in him amen
[1:01:00] he was wise amen that's why that's why
[1:01:02] that's why the bible says jesus said to
[1:01:04] him that hath he will be given more
[1:01:07] you see but to him the hath not what he
[1:01:09] has will just be taken away from him
[1:01:11] you see but solomon had a form of some
[1:01:14] form of wisdom already
[1:01:15] enough to say he didn't ask for riches
[1:01:18] he didn't ask for
[1:01:19] for a nice uh uh castle or or anything
[1:01:23] like that
[1:01:24] he just said lord i want to have the
[1:01:27] wisdom to be
[1:01:28] able to lead these people because they
[1:01:31] are
[1:01:32] so many to be the the king
[1:01:35] that i need to be before them
[1:01:39] and you know what that pleased to god
[1:01:43] to answer that way just like it pleased
[1:01:46] jesus christ amen when the seraphim
[1:01:48] woman came asking him
[1:01:50] my daughter is so sick and and can you
[1:01:52] come and heal her and he called her a
[1:01:54] dog
[1:01:56] he said th this this bread is not for
[1:01:58] you
[1:01:59] gentiles but for the children of of of
[1:02:02] israel
[1:02:04] and she replies with one of the best
[1:02:06] statements i've ever heard
[1:02:08] because why she wasn't gonna leave there
[1:02:10] without a blessing
[1:02:13] she wasn't gonna leave there without
[1:02:14] getting something from him
[1:02:16] getting what she wanted and she said
[1:02:17] lord even the dogs eat from
[1:02:20] the crumbs off the master's table
[1:02:24] so in other words whatever benefits that
[1:02:27] bread has
[1:02:28] those crumbs come out of that bread and
[1:02:31] i have i can receive
[1:02:32] just the same benefit from that bread in
[1:02:34] other words the ocean and the spoon
[1:02:37] amen amen amen if you can just give me
[1:02:39] the spoon lord
[1:02:40] yeah with that hey man i i'll have the
[1:02:43] whole ocean
[1:02:44] that's what she was saying
[1:02:48] he said he even jesus was was was
[1:02:51] was uh uh astonished you know at the uh
[1:02:54] and he said daughter do you know what
[1:02:56] she said go receive your faith have made
[1:02:58] you whole or
[1:02:59] received amen he didn't even have to go
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:03] amen he said just go she's going to be
[1:03:05] fine
[1:03:07] amen praise god so here solomon was kind
[1:03:09] of doing the same thing
[1:03:11] responded responded the same remember
[1:03:14] hattie wright
[1:03:15] when when when god told her ask what you
[1:03:18] will
[1:03:19] as brother branham told her ask what you
[1:03:21] want and it'll be given to you
[1:03:23] she could have asked for a better home
[1:03:25] her her sister was sick
[1:03:27] she could have asked for her healing she
[1:03:29] could ask but she said she
[1:03:31] she asked for the better thing and that
[1:03:33] was the salvation of hers
[1:03:35] of her sons you see she asked for the
[1:03:39] better thing
[1:03:40] how many of us would have asked for that
[1:03:42] how many of us would have
[1:03:44] or would we have asked for the riches
[1:03:48] and the better house and the better
[1:03:50] truck and the better
[1:03:52] uh you know motorcycle or something
[1:03:59] if you did then god can't entrust you
[1:04:02] with
[1:04:03] with with you see but he could entrust
[1:04:06] here solomon when he asked for wisdom
[1:04:08] so the wisdom that he received was from
[1:04:10] god
[1:04:12] but watch now it was not enough to give
[1:04:14] him
[1:04:15] the new birth so really in a sense it
[1:04:19] was limited wisdom
[1:04:21] amen think about that i mean
[1:04:25] he was the wisest man in the world but
[1:04:26] it was limited amen
[1:04:28] we know eventually even with his wisdom
[1:04:31] the way he the way he ended
[1:04:33] he made unwise decisions later on
[1:04:37] with all the wisdom that he had
[1:04:40] he still made unwise decisions
[1:04:43] you see when the spirit of christ
[1:04:47] amen is in the believer amen
[1:04:50] he will lead you and guide you unto all
[1:04:53] truth
[1:04:54] amen and so that's the wisdom that we're
[1:04:56] talking about amen
[1:04:58] the wisdom of god amen just give me just
[1:05:00] a few more minutes amen
[1:05:03] maybe we might continue this next time
[1:05:05] yet the rulers
[1:05:08] the rulers around solomon including the
[1:05:10] queen of shiva
[1:05:11] the queen of sheba traveled three months
[1:05:13] to see about this wisdom
[1:05:16] and it and it changed her life
[1:05:19] you know when you read those messages
[1:05:20] that brother branham preached about the
[1:05:22] queen of sheba
[1:05:23] amen she traveled three months to go to
[1:05:27] church
[1:05:28] [Laughter]
[1:05:31] three months to go to church and
[1:05:34] sometimes we can't travel 30 minutes
[1:05:37] to a service
[1:05:42] we can't travel man 15 minutes
[1:05:45] to go to a service amen
[1:05:49] she because she wanted to see about this
[1:05:51] wisdom
[1:05:52] this wisdom that that man had
[1:05:55] a man that this man had she wanted to go
[1:05:58] see it
[1:06:00] and she received from it amen
[1:06:03] she received from that wisdom she saw
[1:06:05] greater things that she had never seen
[1:06:07] before
[1:06:08] that's the same thing that's the same
[1:06:10] attitude amen that we should have
[1:06:11] whenever we
[1:06:12] come to the house of god just kind of
[1:06:13] bringing it down you see
[1:06:15] right when you come to the house of god
[1:06:17] amen what attitude do you have when you
[1:06:19] come to the church
[1:06:20] amen what attitude do you have about
[1:06:23] church in general
[1:06:24] is it just a lodge to you is it just a
[1:06:27] meeting place to kind of is it a club
[1:06:31] like you know how the shriners they meet
[1:06:32] together or how the uh
[1:06:34] the uh uh you know all these different
[1:06:37] clubs that they're out there you know is
[1:06:38] it a club to you
[1:06:40] or is it life because
[1:06:43] the word of god which is the wisdom of
[1:06:46] god which is life
[1:06:47] which is eternal life is being is is
[1:06:50] coming forth from this from
[1:06:51] from this pulpit amen
[1:06:55] and so do you see it that way or is it
[1:06:58] just a club
[1:07:00] amen i'm afraid that some of us kind of
[1:07:03] see it that way
[1:07:06] we see it that it's just something that
[1:07:07] we could just do every now and then
[1:07:09] or whenever we want to whenever we want
[1:07:12] to and it doesn't work that way
[1:07:15] you will not get ahead of in your life
[1:07:17] amen when you when you see
[1:07:19] come into church like that that's right
[1:07:21] right i guarantee you
[1:07:23] amen you will not get ahead in life
[1:07:26] amen but when you see coming to church
[1:07:28] as a priority
[1:07:30] above anything else worldly amen
[1:07:34] above anything else there's a blessing
[1:07:36] in your life
[1:07:38] amen there's a blessing in your life
[1:07:41] amen
[1:07:42] and it will be it will show forth it
[1:07:44] will show forth
[1:07:46] amen we can't we can't even hardly
[1:07:48] travel 30 minutes to come to church
[1:07:50] sometimes
[1:07:52] and then we say that we have the spirit
[1:07:54] of wisdom in us
[1:07:56] amen see if if solomon's wisdom
[1:08:00] changed the queen's life how much more
[1:08:04] now us now with the wisdom of god
[1:08:07] imparted through us
[1:08:08] through the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:08:28] i want i want to be more of that
[1:08:30] sometimes i sometimes we
[1:08:32] just get so carried away with our own
[1:08:34] with our own selves and
[1:08:36] we forget amen where we've come from
[1:08:40] you see and where and where we need to
[1:08:42] be so that we can go where we need to go

[1:09:38] there was a little there was a little
[1:09:39] story that that i read uh about
[1:09:42] about and with with this i might finish
[1:09:44] up or we'll read a
[1:09:45] last quote here but just kind of it's
[1:09:48] kind of
[1:09:48] uh make you uh make you all smile just a
[1:09:51] little bit
[1:09:52] or i wouldn't be able to see your smiles
[1:09:56] but
[1:09:56] [Laughter]
[1:09:58] but there's a little funny story that
[1:09:59] that i read about a
[1:10:01] a little a young man who went to
[1:10:03] socrates
[1:10:05] the the the philosopher i think and was
[1:10:08] he went to him
[1:10:08] and he said he said socrates mr socrates
[1:10:12] i want you to
[1:10:14] to impart to me wisdom and knowledge
[1:10:19] and he said it to him with a smile like
[1:10:22] can you do that
[1:10:26] so socrates was looking at this boy and
[1:10:28] he's like
[1:10:29] man this is chump
[1:10:32] you know it's a chump he thinks that he
[1:10:34] could just get wisdom and knowledge just
[1:10:36] like that
[1:10:38] he said okay you want wisdom and
[1:10:40] knowledge all right
[1:10:42] let's go over here so he takes him over
[1:10:44] to the sea
[1:10:45] they live there next to the ocean and he
[1:10:47] takes them over to the sea they walk to
[1:10:49] the shore right there
[1:10:50] and they get into the water about about
[1:10:52] chest high
[1:10:54] and so and so socrates says what is it
[1:10:56] that you want again
[1:10:58] say i want i want wisdom and knowledge
[1:11:02] so socrates with his strong hands takes
[1:11:04] him and
[1:11:06] takes him puts his hands on his shoulder
[1:11:07] and just buries him in the water
[1:11:10] for about 30 seconds counts all the way
[1:11:12] to 30
[1:11:13] and then lets me out and he comes out of
[1:11:16] the water
[1:11:18] what is it that you want again i want
[1:11:21] wisdom
[1:11:23] so socrates looks at him again and he
[1:11:25] pushes him down again this time he
[1:11:26] leaves him down for 40 seconds
[1:11:29] counts to 40. brings them back up
[1:11:35] what is it that you want i want
[1:11:37] knowledge
[1:11:38] so socrates go okay brings him back down
[1:11:42] again
[1:11:42] this time he leaves him in there for 50
[1:11:44] seconds
[1:11:46] amen and he says
[1:11:49] and then and then after the 50 second he
[1:11:51] lets him out and he's really
[1:11:54] breathing really hard what is it that
[1:11:56] you want
[1:11:58] i really want knowledge and wisdom
[1:12:02] and he said if if you really want it
[1:12:04] that bad
[1:12:05] if you really want it that bad the way
[1:12:07] you're you're grasping you're
[1:12:08] you're gasping for air now amen because
[1:12:11] what he said was i really want air
[1:12:13] now that's what he said he said i really
[1:12:15] want air
[1:12:16] that's what i want he said the way you
[1:12:18] want air amen and that's if
[1:12:20] that's how you really want knowledge and
[1:12:21] wisdom amen then you'll obtain it then
[1:12:24] you see the way you need that air amen
[1:12:27] coming out of the water
[1:12:29] so the way you want amen the holy ghost
[1:12:31] to move in your life amen
[1:12:32] you will be desperate for it exactly
[1:12:34] right you will not be
[1:12:36] you know just just you know in your own
[1:12:38] way

[1:12:41] thinking that you're going to get by
[1:12:43] amen you're going to be desperate
[1:12:44] for it and doing it the right way
[1:12:48] doing it according to the word seeking

[1:12:52] and according to the message amen you

[1:13:12] take the place of god in our life amen
[1:13:16] if you could seek god that way you will
[1:13:18] get
[1:13:19] very far with god let me read this quote
[1:13:22] real quick and we'll finish with this
[1:13:25] and we'll just continue this maybe next
[1:13:27] time because there's something here i

[1:13:48] and cannot die now the word the bible
[1:13:52] is eternal because it is god in word
[1:13:55] form

[1:15:06] in his mind a word is a spoken thought

[1:21:26] decision about
[1:21:27] about maybe going this this november or
[1:21:30] december
[1:21:31] to central america but the things that
[1:21:33] the brothers are telling me i mean
[1:21:35] there's still so many restrictions and
[1:21:36] things i mean
[1:21:38] there's an invitation that invitation
[1:21:40] that i have to costa rica
[1:21:43] that i had from last december and the
[1:21:45] brother i talked with him the other
[1:21:47] there and
[1:21:48] the other day and he said brother he
[1:21:50] said honestly
[1:21:51] churches are not even open right now
[1:21:54] there's there's really i mean if you're
[1:21:55] going to come
[1:21:56] and then you're going to you're going to
[1:21:57] face the all these restrictions and all
[1:21:59] these different closures and all these
[1:22:01] different things he said
[1:22:02] and then if you do come and get through
[1:22:04] you know through the airport
[1:22:06] you're just going to be ministering
[1:22:07] through a zoom through zoom you know
[1:22:10] he said honestly maybe just re-double
[1:22:12] think it so
[1:22:13] i guess that was my answer for the to
[1:22:15] not go this at least to costa rica but
[1:22:17] there's still an option there for
[1:22:19] nicaragua and honduras again
[1:22:21] nicaragua doesn't have hardly any
[1:22:23] restrictions whatsoever churches are
[1:22:24] open there
[1:22:25] everything is just kind of pretty much
[1:22:27] the same and so uh there's some things
[1:22:30] that
[1:22:30] i would love to be able to help out with
[1:22:32] them over there but
