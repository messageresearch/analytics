Genesis chapter 2 and read verses 7 to 10 then we'll skip to verse 15 and read to the end of the chapter it's a great privilege to be here we mentioned last night we've known some of you for quite a long time brother Bob Black was one of my first friends I gained when I began to serve the Lord there in the late 90s and so it's good to see him and his family and also to hear that he's been ministering the Word of the Lord that's wonderful and I certainly appreciate all the supporting ministries that are here at where the Bob may be brother Joseph even brother Wade I know what it's like to serve my father in ministry and help in a church and so all of you are necessary and important and I just wanted to acknowledge the different ones that help lift up the burden of the word with brother Samuel brother Samuel has a good testimony among the brothers I always heard he's a tremendous teacher and I love a teaching ministry and I'm so I know not to try to compete with the teacher we just do our part and lift up the word of the Lord I'm very very glad to be here with you and we bring greetings from our pastor brother berry coffee and the Saints there in Hickory North Carolina Hickory Bible Tabernacle we moved there from Fort Worth this past December so we haven't been in the South too long so just be patient with me if I'm if I don't have the correct mannerisms for a southerner we're just we're just learning them and I'm an old dog so it just takes me longer to learn these learn these new tricks but we send love and greetings to you and very very happy to be here Genesis chapter 2 and we'll start with verse 7 and it says the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and that that sentence contains so much he planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and I just it comes in my mind as I read this every tree that grew out of the ground was good to eat so God's not trying to trick him if they grew out of the ground it's okay to eat it so this tree that you partake in that would cause death must not have grown from the ground so we know it's not just by the plain language of Scripture we know that there's a mystery there in the original sin and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into foreheads and we'll just skip for time to verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat why those trees that grow out of the ground you may eat out of but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die so it must not have grown from the ground and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call him and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air into every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of the ribs one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed a man we desire God bless the reading of the scripture you can be seated my title this today is fulfilling the original fulfilling the original and I want to use the statement from power of transformation that is serves as my inspiration and just what we'll be building from today as the Lord gives us Liberty and brother branham says there was Adam and Eve walking in the garden every seed bringing forth it could never do nothing else it never could do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way and so brother Branham is actually describing the condition of Adam and Eve at the end of Genesis chapter 2 and in some ways he's describing to us what would be the silence between Genesis chapter 2 and Genesis chapter 3 because after this scene has been set in Genesis chapter 2 immediately we come into Genesis chapter 3 where the fall comes so brother Bram is describing what would be the silence between these two chapters Adam and Eve walking in the garden every seed bringing forth he says it could never do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way and brother man once he describes this scene which he as a prophet he's describing it but yet it's not outlined that way in Scripture you're not read not reading from Genesis to 26 or anything like that he's just describing what it must have been like and he makes this statement oh how I'd like to stop here just a minute to say see there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word that's a remarkable statement and it just really grabbed me how he says this he's describing Adam and Eve walking in the garden each seed bringing forth and he says that is what we're facing I want to stop now he says and I want to point out that we right now are facing the completion of that word that word that signified they're in Genesis chapter 2 we are facing the fulfillment he says the completion has to bring something to fulfillment we're facing the fulfillment of that word so I want to just expound upon that today on this subject to fulfill in the original because there must be a restoration of the original in order to complete the fridge the original in order to fulfill God's original and ultimate purpose there must be some restoration of these elements of Adam and the woman walking in the garden each seed bringing four and we know that brother branham makes many remarkable statements about purpose and how that God has a purpose for you and Satan cannot take you till God's purposed is finished so yet God's purpose becomes something that's the overriding power over our lives because Satan is unable to touch us until God's purpose is finished and so a purpose is the intention of something or the goal the aim that something has and it's the combination of the prefix pur which is to put forth and pose which is to put or to place so there's a placing you set something forth you place it you positionally put it with an intended design or for it to do something so when you purpose something as a verb you design it in a particular way so the purpose relates to the the intention of something the design of something placing up in a particular position in order for it to accomplish a very specific goal and brother Bram says all at the church only knew its position right he knew what he was putting her forth for if he knew why he was positionally placing her by the word he says it will one day set off she only knew it and Christ is the mystery God revealed that silence lifting from that Seventh Seal oh she only knew her purpose which is revealed under that Seventh Seal she only knew her purpose he says oh she will one day it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is so this is the power in purpose this is the power in understanding our purpose the purpose of God is such a great force one of the most important things his intention his goal and his design even for us and so what we're facing brother Bram says what we're facing is the completion of that word what we're facing today is the fulfillment of God's original purpose we're facing the completion of what God had in his mind from the very very beginning brother Branham says in question and answers the very creator that the earth for a purpose he created the earth for purpose he said Satan defiled him what Satan defiled was the earth and in defiling the earth he interrupted God's plan because he cannot destroy God's purpose but he created the earth for the purpose brother Bentham writes in the church age book the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so God's heart purpose that means his very central purpose the very thing at the very center of God what gave him essence and meaning and purpose of existing was to take a bride of his own choosing but RAM says in the message paradox God made the earth he made it for purpose what are we all here for why did God make the earth he says to take a church out of it a bride says and that's the most important job in the world so when brother BAM said the very creator that created the earth for purpose the very purpose of the earth was to get a bride out of it from the very moment that God formed himself in the logos he was moving himself towards fulfilling this purpose because if you think about it if God did God bless you better Lewis didn't mean to leave your name out I don't know who all the preachers are here so if I left your name out I'm sorry I'm only going by the ones I've met and you can meet me afterwards and set me straight and I'll remember to remember to acknowledge you next time but he God in the very beginning has this purpose in his heart to have a bride of his choosing had he just created a bride she just would have been okay God God and fills all time and space there was nothing else but God and if he just would have created some thing she'd just been there like okay Here I am but God wanted to have a bride of his own choosing so it first forms himself into the logos and from that very moment that God becomes expressed in this logos he's working towards this ultimate desire of having a bride of his choosing so he made the earth for a purpose to get a bride a Bateses and that's the most important job there is in the world he brights in the church age book chapter seven he says first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose so that he says that the purpose of God stands in election he's in it that's a drawing from Romans chapter nine in these different things he says it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose now this is brother branham bringing it down to a very singular goal it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride this is God's purpose so then you can see how brother Branham can make a statement that what we're facing today is the completion of that word and when he says that he's pointing to what was happening in Genesis because in Genesis we see the beginning of all things and that's the beginning of God now is expressing his divine purpose and introducing us to his goal of having a bride of his own choosing so if we look back to Genesis we can see God's pattern we could see God's purpose things God's doing to foreshadow his ultimate desire of having a people likened to himself that would be a word bride to have a bride of his own choosing that purpose was in himself I love that a people like unto himself someone co-equal something that had lightness God lightness God equality and so this is I want to begin to look into Genesis because it's the beginning of what we're finishing it's at the beginning of what God is wanting to fulfill and in Genesis not only do you see the beginning of God's purpose being made plain but you also see Satan's attempt to stop it and to fight against it billa Branham says in marriage and divorce Genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the Bible I apologize if I'm going fast and if it seems like I'm going fast I think I'm going even a little bit slower than I normally do I get I get nervous when I preach and then I just preach faster but the bad part is is when the pull when there's no pull and it's really dry that's when you preach your fastest because you just want to get it over with so if I slow down and and go long it's your fault so it says Genesis is the seed chapter 2 every question in the Bible and you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of seed is in the field to find out what your crop will be so this is why we'd go back to Genesis and lose fellowship in it Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and chapter 3 today because it's the scene chapter where the man says it all come up in Genesis it's the seed he says you start in Genesis you get says you'll get your picture straight so if we want to know what we're facing the completion of today you go back to Genesis and you'll get your picture straight we'll know what to expect we'll know what God is doing and so brother Branham is just want to keep repeating this phrase he says there was Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth he says there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word so we're facing the completion of something that Adam and the woman did not finish we're facing the fulfilment and the bringing to the climax and the product which God envisioned in the beginning when he sold those seeds in Genesis so Genesis of the seed chapter of every question in the Bible go back to Genesis that's where the seeds were sown so if they were seed sown in Genesis what we're facing today is the perfection and the full harvest of what God showed in the beginning my what an exciting time to be living that even a seed that he sowed in Genesis those intentions he had that are going to come to fruit in this hour and we're going to be the expression of it his brother Branham says there was a three-fold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve so he makes that statement there was a three-fold purpose of God we know that the language that he uses to express himself in Christ have premise and the bride restored back to the Garden of Eden will read some statements from Christ as the mystery to expound upon that but he make when he makes this statement the threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve so his purpose was a mystery that was hidden the very manifestation of the man and the woman the threefold purpose was manifested in Adam and Eve but there was a it was a hidden mystery that a prophet now is bringing out to us and if I could say this the purpose of God is fulfilled or completed by fulfilling what God started in that manifestation of Adam and the woman I says in Christ as the mystery of God revealed what's his threefold purpose because what we're seeing in the manifestation of Adam and the woman God was foreshadowing something there was a type thing because Satan thought he came in marred martyred the whole thing but in doing so Satan only worked right into God's plan to express redemption to express his purpose in his ultimate plan so he says what what's his three-fold purpose manifests himself in Jesus Christ that's the first of the threefold manifest himself in Jesus Christ that expresses the bridegroom that expresses the last Adam and so this is the purpose threefold purpose of Christ to meta name so God wants to manifest himself in Jesus Christ and then to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence so by Jesus Christ and if you wanted to even back up and with the the cross of the shedding of blood and the sacrifice of the life brought for us is by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he can come into the body and have the preeminence and who is the body it is the bride it is the last woman and you can see all these things foreshadowed in Genesis 3 and the shedding of blood and even in these things that take place in Scripture and so that's the first fold the second fold have preeminence in the bride to restore back in that's the third part but he has to do this he has to restore back Eden bring back that which lost and that's that's a real good summary statement where Birnbaum is identifying these three parts the threefold purpose of God manifested in Adam and the woman and we see that there was a bridegroom there was a bride and there was a condition that existed them together he says it this way in that sermon now through that the Tree of Life he brings forth the bride tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him it's gonna come back to God she says as a husband and wife in the Garden of Eden so now this is God's expression back to husband and wife in the Garden of Eden by the same word in the same God that made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again so we know that the tree of knowledge of good and evil produced Satan's Eden and it brought to pass what we look out in the world today to see the climax of the pinnacle of Satan's plan and Satan's devices and that's come by the way of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but now by the tree of life by that he brings forth the bride tree which is The Tree of Life restored back to the expression of a husband wife God made manifest as husband and wife the bride tree back again he says continuing and now on his way back to the original Eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride and I'm and I'm just I guess maybe it's cherry-picking or peach picking maybe is what we do here just just to kind of take these statements out where he's identifying that it's back to Eden in the Garden of Eden back to the original Eden in the Garden of Eden this is a language he's using in Christ as the mystery so this mystery that was in the back part of God's mind which is now unfolding to us by the open of the seals which only a prophet could bring it forth he's bringing to us this great mystery this thing's been the back part of God's mind and you were the thought in God's mind because you were the heart purpose so when he preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed he's not so much just talking about Jesus the man who walked the shores of Galilee but he's actually bringing forth the bride because Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride is the mystery of God finished and it's always bringing these thoughts to us out of the Garden of Eden because this is where God's plan was first hidden he's there in the Garden of Eden so he says it's a revelation it's as eternal as God's Word is eternal this is still in Christ the mystery look the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's not just maybe a location uh with certain amenities and and and maybe a certain landscape or sort of things growing but it's a condition back to the original condition in the garden I mean there was a Garden of Eden condition that God has to restore back to you so in fulfilling the original there has to be a manifestation of the full maturity of the original spoken word and that spoken word seed which was sown in the beginning because you got to have to fulfill this purpose right so when we see when even when we believe and we hear it taught that this message is restoring us it's a restoration and it's a restoration back to go back to the original it's a restoration of that image and that condition that existed in the Garden of Eden because when brother Branham was restoring us back and this is a restoration message it's not just back to Pentecost and even back to what that first church was in the beginning but it's actually fulfilling the purpose of what that first church was for and we will get into that perhaps later as we continue today is this was this is actually this message restored just all the way back to the very beginning of the Garden of Eden that's what this message restores us back to an image and a condition that is expressed in the Garden of Eden now and it's wonderful to be able to minister to people who are taught well because you don't feel like you have to read a dozen quotes just to substantiate what you're saying so I can make this statement and and know that you'll just pick right up where brother Ben taught these things but the first masterpiece was adamant the woman in a perfect Eden brother man have called it a masterpiece family so the it's important to understand this part the first masterpiece was not Adam it was Adam and the woman the first masterpiece was a family brother man it says in the masterpiece for nearly 2,000 years God has been making him a masterpiece he says he struck Adam so now he's pointing us to what's happened in this hour because that's what we're facing yet today the completion of that word and so there's something that that word signified a represented so he says he struck Adam to get a part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him so the the image that brother Brandon brings up before us is that here at first was Adam and that he took a piece of Adam and made the woman and that was a masterpiece then he raised up Jesus Christ who is the last Adam and then he takes a piece also off of him and that is to be the bride and now you have the masterpiece coming into expression again so in it's wonderful language he says he's got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all well if I'm gonna be at that's all that's all I want to be it's just the New Testament so there's this is a great mystery because now the bride is the fulfillment of the New Testament he says he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled it's important to understand the Old Testament contained prophecy that has expressed perfectly in Jesus Christ and now the New Testament language contains prophecy that is expressed in you they look at Old Testament New Testament they say well that's it this is the complete word but the Old Testament was made perfect in the flesh of Jesus Christ now the New Testaments made perfect in your flesh he goes see the new and the old is husband and wife and it take it took the old to foreshadow the new Christ come to masterpiece to fulfill that the old now his bride and this is really maybe a thesis of what I'm trying to share today now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpiece isn't making a lot because you have the bridegroom revealed to the bride in order to have a masterpiece in the making there has to be an expression of a perfect bridegroom and there has to be an expression of a bride that's been brought face to face with that bridegroom because in the beginning he brought her unto the man so there has to be a coming together in a recognition and an acknowledgement of the bridegroom and the bride to come back to a completion and the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament says another masterpiece isn't making so the bride fulfills all the hope all the promise and all the potential of the original New Testament church this message and I share this with with great caution and take great care with my words because I'm in no way trying to talk down on anything that God has done this message restores us back to the faith of our Pentecostal fathers it restores us back to that Pentecost in order to achieve what that one didn't and I say that with great care because I wouldn't want to disparage at all but if we have time to get into this brother BAM teaches very plainly that all the promise and all the potential and what that church stood for the glory that could have come from her it didn't because Satan's work against it and defiled it but we are predestinated to not fall out so brother so you could take these images of the original woman in the original Church and begin to see how brother Bentham is expressing this in the masterpiece he says Michelangelo could not reproduce that again now as he's describing Moses and this is a great a piece of art that it was chiseled out of stone and as he struck that the knee there of Moses and told it to speak and that piece broke off he said he couldn't he couldn't reproduce that work he could replicate it he could maybe try to do another one but that one could never be restored says he could not put it back but God is going to do it he is going to bring this little bride that smitten right back to the side of the original word now that to me implies that there's a union that takes place during whatever has been ripped apart whatever has been torn whatever has been rented it's brought back into perfection again he says and there he is there's the masterpiece the family back in the Garden of Eden says how is this bride going to do this how is this week going to do this Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back restored back like the beginning whatever was lost through the fall is brought back whatever was expressed and the man and the woman God's going to be stored back because God's going to put that family back together again I'm gonna take this little bride though she's smitten it's gonna be right back to the side of the original word he says this in Satan's Eden says having faith in all his word his seeds he speaking of God brought an Eden of holiness love and eternal life so God had faith in his own word why because he's not gonna ask you to do something that he hasn't done already God practices what he preaches and so in order for the word seemed to bring forth God had to have faith in his own word so when he tells you to believe his word he's telling you to do what he's already done and look what it did for him it can do the same thing for you God with faith in his own word seed it brought forth and Eden of holiness and love and eternal life he says that's what God's Eden produced holiness and it brought an Eden of holiness of love understanding perfection and eternal life brother Branham described how they had perfect love around him no death around him describes his perfection there in Eden he says that's what God is planting his word his seed that's what his church will be at the end it will be the same thing now brother Branham has has connected the condition of the Garden of Eden the holiness the love the eternal life the understanding the perfection he's connected it with the what the bride will be now so he's connected what the bride is now to the original condition in the Garden of Eden why because this word is to restore us back to the condition of the Garden of Eden so while he's preaching Satan's Eden he's describing God's original Eden and how that God has already sold a word seed that Satan's Eden could not destroy and God will in the midst of sayings Eden restored back the image of what was in God's originally praise the Lord he says that's what the bride the church will be at the end she'll be the same thing that that garden was holy perfect having understanding holiness the bride that will be a manifestation of his planting because he says this is God this is what God is planting there's gonna be holiness love understanding perfection no death around her at all so there's there's an image that's expressed in this original garden that God plants that signifies and represents the bride so if you look at Genesis chapter and in verse seven he's formed the man now he hasn't created him again but he first makes him supernatural spiritual which is in the image of God and in verse seven he actually forms him not creating forms a body that he puts this man I had quickens him to life in this whole body now becomes through that quickening this this this flesh which came from the dirt it becomes one person body spirit soul another it becomes a living soul the soul in man living animating spirit animating body and this is of the perfect man here is Adam in the beginning Ana the very next statement is verse eight Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed now this is a beautiful beautiful picture God God has in this verse just laid out his plan of redemption and his plan even up to the very end and I hope just to amplify this for the remainder of our time this morning and then whatever I do in the afternoon beginning at noon we might just change change the subject but it and that doesn't mean I'm gonna finish this morning I would just continue under the evening or maybe and while to do that we'd have to preach a long time because the next service starts at 2:00 I'm mindful of them but he's laying something out here which is quite remarkable now the man is perfectly expressed and then he says the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden this threefold purpose manifested in the man of the woman so now you have the man and now you have the garden but this garden represents something because it isn't there he put the man he had formed and God is foreshadowing something about this endtime he says the Lord God planted a garden eastward that means in the beginning so it's not so much a geographical location well that's in the East part of Eden but also means symbolically and literally that God had planted a garden already at the beginning of so when God formed Eden at the beginning he had planted a garden when he formed Eden there was already a seeds have been sown of a garden and Eden means his delight so God had planted a garden eastward at the beginning Eden so in his delight there was a garden that he had formed he had planted and brother Bram says when Adam and Eve had their children in Eden he says not in the Garden of Eden because they've been driven out of the Garden of Eden but they were still in Eden and the Garden of Eden laid east in in so this was something special that God had planted in the garden or planted in Eden this was a special place in Eden so that Adam and Eve after the fall before the fall it's Adam and the woman after the fall it's Adam and Eve and so because if we were living in a perfect condition the bathrooms that say Adam and woman but since we're in the fall to have the faults Adam and Eve hey does it says this in a number of different places and not just in this one instance where he's identifying the Garden of Eden as a special place within Eden this is something that God had planted a garden this is very specific God plants a garden eastward in Eden Reverend says there was a Garden of Eden that laid East in Eden someplace special now brother Adam says it this way in Satan's Eden when he got it all made finally arrived with its headquarters of the earth and a beautiful spot lane East of Eden called the Garden of Eden so it was a Garden God made the world headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right at the at the east end of the garden was the headquarters and over the whole situation now he's describing this Garden of Eden condition he put his son and his son's wife over all of it and when he's preaching Satan's Eden marriage and divorce and godless evil age he he says some very strong things about the woman and the fallen woman but he also says that in the beginning the woman and the man were coequal and he says he put his son and his son's wife over all of it so and when he establishes this Dominion he's not saying that Adam had this dominion over the woman we find that the rule that he has over here comes after the fall and there and then needed that because even the woman had to be told now your desire has to be to your husband before it didn't have to be told there was a perfect love that they had one for the other he says he put his son and his son's wife over all of it that's what God did he put them in full control they could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow they could speak to the tree and it would move from here to there think about what this message is trying to bring us to not to a place we say Oh God do this oh God do that but when you speak that's the power of the third Pole when you speak that's what this message is trying to bring us to where the bride has thus saith the Lord where she speaks the word she it's God fulfilling his word the way he wants to do it and he does it for you as you think about Adam there at the beginning and the woman brother Graham is saying that they put it in their control where they could speak and brother Branham at the end is trying to declare that the bride she must speak it's not even all honey oh dear would you do this but now it's the bride could speak and that's exactly what brother Branham is manifested in those five temporary manifestations of the third pole and there's one that stands out to me is very extraordinary when he created those squirrels he didn't say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't call it upon the Lord he just said let there be and there was and that would perfectly Express Adam and the woman there at the very beginning Adam didn't say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the power given to me by God Adam just spoke it and said move here do this and do that and it did it and now here's a prophet standing there in the wilderness speaking the word and by his own authority it comes to be what is it that's God speaking I don't say this to embarrass anybody but it's amazing how people can sleep why somebody's screaming young people these days right those earbuds have just they they they it's in their ears they reduce their hearing down to a preacher can just scream his lungs out and they don't hear it maybe we should pass out earbuds he says he put them in full control they could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow they would speak to the tree and it would move from here to there the lion and the wolf fed together and the lamb laid down with them there was no evil it was perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection and when God had it under his control he had his world he had it all in operation he had everything coming this is the word that began this is what God loved this is a this is the world that God loved this is what God looked to and and thought was so wonderful and then saying this now and I may be getting it in a little bit what I want to get to later when the Bible says for God so loved the world this is the world God loved because that's what he sent his son to redeem is this world not the cosmos we see around today but this is the world God loved and it's the way you resolve the paradoxes the Bible says if you love the world and the things of this world the love of the father's not in him so when you have to understand the world that God loved this is the world that God loved for God so loved this world that He gave His only begotten Son to redeem this world but if you love that world then the love of the father's not in you perfect everything's perfect had everything under control everything eating eating vegetations nothing to die nothing to be ruined nothing to be spoiled it was just perfect and over all of it he placed his beloved children his son and his daughter a husband and wife to control it this is this is how brother Branham describes the word that we're completing God is foreshadowing the bride of the perfect Eden God's foreshadowing what his ultimate desired objective is and in this very language that God uses in the the Lord God planted a garden in Eden the word garden is figurative of a spouse it is figurative of a Brian because it says the Tree of Life was also in the midst of the garden brother Benson's gonna be by that tree of life when this bride comes back it brings back the tree of life again and so there's a tree of life also in the midst of a garden he says in verse 10 and the river went out of Eden to water the garden so you can see that this garden is figure to them even the bride the Tree of Life and the midst of her and how even the river of life running running to it to water the garden and you see these very things expressed in Revelations at the end in this New Jerusalem which is the bride because what does brother branham teach us we know the future home they're described in Revelations 21 in those places how it's describing the New Jerusalem of future city but it's first expressed in you because brother Brennan says when a man chooses a woman he's choosing her based upon what he wants his future home to be so the choice of a wife reveals what the future home will be when a man chooses the woman she holds the mystery of the future home when God chose the bride she is the revelation of the mystery of the future home you hold that so you're the first expression of that New Jerusalem the City of God and that's why there's maybe John said I'd you want to see the Lambs wife and he's shown a city then he's gonna see the city and he and he just he sees the Lambs wife what is it he the way he's described it's the same thing first expressed in the flesh of God's people his bride and so this garden is represents the bride in the very beginning when he speaks he planted a garden eastward in Eden Eden and there he put the man he had formed he's actually foreshadowing you I want to look at Scripture Hosea chapter 2 verse 23 we're identifying what was being foreshadowed in the garden this hidden mystery the completion the word that we're facing the completion of and Hosea at 2:23 there's a great mystery hidden this I will sow her unto me the earth this is a mister of the Gentile bride he says I'll have mercy upon her that had not obtained a mercy and I will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god so this is actually Hosea 2:23 is a prophecy of a Gentile Briony the body of Christ which we be made up of Gentiles who were not a people of God before regardez heathens and reprobates and people of no promise and and but God had identified himself with Israel and they were the God of Israel he was the God of Israel they were the people of God the children of God but now he prophesized that a people that before he had not had mercy on people that were not his people before he was going to reveal that they were in fact his people I never say that weren't my god and it all begins with the seed I will sow her unto me in the earth the Lord planted a bride at the beginning of Eden before say never got to the woman God had already planted the bride I will sow her a bride a body for me unto me in the earth it's already there just as you said the Lord planted a garden at the beginning of Eden I will saw her under me and the earth here's the seed already started the beginning everything sown by the spoken word all seeds were sown in Genesis brother mem says and he's planted a bride in the beginning and he gets to foreshadow that bride through this garden Song of Solomon chapter 4 verses 12 to 16 says the garden enclosed is my sister my spouse the garden indicates a wife it's a spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed my plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits Kemp fire was spikenard Spiker and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices a fountain of gardens a well of living waters but the tree of life is in the midst of the garden a Rivard way out of Eden to water the garden he's describing these things the continuity of scriptures beautiful and streams from Lebanon verse 16 awake o north wind and come thy south blow upon my god that the spices thereof may flow out so this is this is now the word coming to the bride let let her fruit be known let it be expressed and then the bride speaks now she says let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits so now you have a garden which is the spouse but now he's won the the brightest income Lord coming to your garden and in Chapter five it begins as the scripture continues verse one I am come into my garden my sister my spouse why is it my sister this is bone in my boat flesh of my flesh it's another description of what happened in the Garden of Eden the Lord planned to the garden the beginning of Eden and there he put the man he had formed but now prophecies going forth about the bride oh my sister my spouse you're a beautiful garden and the Brice's let my beloved come into his garden he says I am come into my spouse I've gathered my myrrh with my spice I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my wine with my milk eat o friends drink a drink abundantly Oh beloved this is a fellowship this is this is a feast this is the bride's secret feast I believe the sister sang a song about Esther and you know that Esther there here's a in the end almost a reverse type here's a Jew named Hadassah myrtle tree roots earthbound and she's raised up to be Esther a star married to a Gentile King it's a mirror image of this bride this Gentile bride who begins earthbound but it's raised up to be a star to be a queen married to the bride of the Jesus Christ the bridegroom and it what is it that Esther doesn't that time she's called to the kingdom for purpose what does she call a feast and her and her husband feast in the presence of her enemies very one is instigating this conspiracy against the Jews against her people and here we can see foreshadowed this prophecy of the bride's feast Song of Solomon I'll come into my garden mice and he says I am coming to my garden wife husband and now the feasting begins she says Oh drink abundantly my beloved Oh drink and joy and joy your creation and says in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 and Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it listen I hope you're putting the pieces together yourself this is exactly what's happened in this end time just as though he had planted this garden now he puts the man in the midst of the garden to dress it and to keep it so that it will bring forth fruit to perfection so that it she'll fit shall fulfill her purpose and as they at 27 verses 2 to 3 in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine so here's the song to her this is a why she's a vineyard she's a planting of the Lord a vineyard of red wine she's fooled the stimulation of Revelation oh what a beautiful prophecy of the bride in that day singing to her a vineyard a planting of the Lord the garden of the Lord hide the Lord to keep it I will water it every moment less teeny hurt it I will keep it night and day I will come into the midst of her I will water it I will dress it I will keep it that she might bring forth fruit to perfection to bring the full manifestation my purpose it will serve its purpose just as he put the man in the garden to dress it and to keep it God prop the sign of you I the Lord will keep it in water at every moment lest any hurt it I will keep it night and day this is very mystery that Paul picks up on an Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 32 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word this is the language now he's using to sanctify and de cleanse I the Lord do keep it watered every morning the man was put in the midst of the garden to dress it and to keep it that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish and whose job is that the husband's say says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church and he realized in that statement he's perfectly referring to Adam in Christ because in those two in there their wives they were their flesh so he says no man ever yet hated his own flesh that's Adam who when his wife sinned he didn't hate his own flesh but he acted quickly under one marriage covenant not a double covenant but under the original marriage coming to acted to restore her and redeem her because he didn't hate his own flesh she was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and now Christ the same with his wife which was fathered he does not put her away and start over but he works to redeem her because those are that's the first man in the last man and no man the first nor the last ever hated his own flesh why because his wife was his own flesh it's beautiful and you were commanded as a man to love your wife that way says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones think of the language he's describing hi in the very beginning Adam says this is bone of my bone flesh of my flesh and now he's saying that we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones he's drawing from the original marriage covenant he's drawing from this original proclamation of Adam and the woman was brought to the man see now quotes almost verbatim from Genesis 2 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined under his wife and they two shall be one flesh it's remarkable how the statement is made by Beth's prophecy and in it it expresses the perfect masterpiece family he says for this cause shall a man leave father and mother even though now all you have expressed as man and woman it expresses the purpose of the divine that the seed must come forth and as he described this a man shall leave his father and mother shall be joined and his wife and they too shall be one flesh we see the image then the perfect expression of God how he desired not just to have a family but to become a family he said God loved fatherhood they said to become a father he had to become the son of man so if God wanted to be a daddy he had to become a son and so in order to be a husband he had to become a wife is the expression of God and he says the two shall be one flesh that means the husband is expressed in Christ now Christ is invisibly United to his bride and the two become one flesh he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church I'm not talking about the men and a wife because that would be a mystery how a man Here I am I'm here with my wife and I believe we're one flesh but yet you can say there's Aaron there's Elizabeth and then we just have these all right whether it's mental gymnastics or whatever it is we just somehow imagine them as one flesh and there wasn't flesh even though there - and maybe that's the mystery with the great mystery there though is the oneness of Christ and the bride and this invisible unit where they're going to come back into perfect harmony again and I'm not sure how far I'll get tonight and I don't mind maybe mission in it now this afternoon as we come to the services afternoon we know this union that's coming together if something that brother Branham says was incomplete in the garden and incomplete in the first church but we're now fulfilling the original it's now complete this is a great mystery he says concerning Christ and his bride what's a mystery then becomes fulfilled now it's not just the mystery built it's the finished mystery why because it's in this last days the mystery of God is finished so Paul is preaching from his revelation of the mystery in the Garden of Eden and when he instructs husbands to love their wives he's drawn from Genesis chapter 2 so he's preaching from his revelation of this mystery in the garden the original three fold purpose of the of Adam and the woman and brother ben says there is where we're facing yet the completion of that word what a brother Bram say about Paul's revelation his revelation then was prophecy for today so what brother Branham preached the same gospel Paul preached amen every bit but he also brings the fulfillment of what Paul preached because brother Branham when he preaches the same gospel Paul preached he's just not repeating what Paul preached you could almost say in one sense up to the time he has that vision of going beyond the curtain of time there before they opened the seals and I can't remember now if it was 61 or what the exact date was when he gives that and I apologize for not being a perfect student of the word but when he gives that when he gives that declaration going on beyond the curtain of time and he expresses these things he says and he says then I will Paul be judged he says yeah he'll be judged as this people says I preached the same gospel Paul preached so he's preaching the same gospel but now at the open of the word he's no longer repeating but it's fulfilling he's actually bringing to pass what Paul would Paul saw and desired to see come to pass because listen Paul wrote to the Hebrews and said I started talking about Melchizedek and he goes you know what there's a lot of things I want to say about Melchizedek but I can't say it because you become like children again and you should be teachers but you become like children need to be taught again you can't endure this strong meat so the things I want to say about Melchizedek I can't say brother branham came along so I'll just take the who is this Melchizedek and I'll preach it at the end time the things even Paul couldn't speak part of Paul's gospel that remained prophecy or mystery this message today is the fulfillment of Paul's revelation in prophecy and so to be completing the original fulfilling what that word represented this restoration back to Eden will try to end on this thought here this restoration back to the original requires the full manifestation of the bride whereas it says and in the midst of the garden there he planted a garden and now this garden represents a wife then we see there in in Song of Solomon and Isaiah and Ephesians 5 the dress in the keeping the sanctifying the cleansing him is a husbandman keeping this vineyard dressing this garden this garden represents a wife and then it says in Genesis that there the Lord took the man and put him into the garden what are we having this endtime we have her Christ The Tree of Life comes down into the midst of her United one with the Tree of Life brother Branham says and does God change his mind he says now Jesus came in three names now I'm really biting off a mouthful here and this is things I know you're faithfully taught so you can immediately begin to connect all the the dozens of places or so where brother Mehmet uses this teaching he came in three names son of man which is a prophet the son of God which went through the church age so he says the son of God is the Baptist although goes to the Holy Ghost through the church ages so he manifested him or revealed himself as the Son of God through church ages now I'm just gonna use this language for you to ponder so that if you reveals himself as son of men then that's a special dispensation that's that that's your exit out of Laodicea that's why we're in a bride age anybody says layout to see is over all right well it is for the bride but all you got to do is look out there and know it ain't over lael to see it exist around us but what are we calling people out of label to see it too - a bride age to a place of safety a secret place a secret feast so he teaches us very carefully he says then son of David which would be the Millennium and he says but in between the Son of God and son of David according to his own word and according to Malachi 4 in many scriptures he is to return back into his church in physical form in the people in human beings in the way of being a prophet oh he's the return back it's the son of man in his people again the son at the revelation the son of man is the invisible union of Christ to his bride that's what the revealed of the Son of Man is it's Christ United with this bride repeating the Ministry of the son of man not just one man it came by way of a prophet a son of man revealing the son of man but now the bride becomes the final voice of the final age because there's been an invisible union with her head the revelation of the capstone is a vindication the raptures at hand it's the uniting between the bride and Christ that's this is the promise of the revealing of the son of man not the denominational conception of a 900-foot Jesus that splits the sky and Janes will start digging out graves and airplanes are crashing and there's just a great catastrophe and a big mess but here is the secret of the revealed of the Son of Man he's returned back into his bride and now he's in physical form because that's one of the big stumbling blocks for this is the form he takes on he's in physical form he is in the physical form of his bride in human beings in his people because the corporal body of Jesus Christ the one that was shed for us the body that's given for us it won't take a step foot on this earth until he returns back with his bride in the Millennium so now he's returned back in you listen I believe this expression of his coming this this coming to the son of man is just as peculiar as the first one look at Jesus all the rumors surrounding him illegitimate child of his some young teenage girl and could it be a Roman soldier but that Joseph look how much older he is and heard all these things all these rumors swirling around but yet there's God in flesh and here it is again today God in the flesh of his people this was always what was in God's mind so here is he's returned back into his bride and to me it just gives great clarity to this prophecy of revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice I will open the door and open the door I will come in to him here it is in the end of Satan's Eden what is it that God does at the end of Satan Neath Eden there he puts the word there Christ comes down puts him in the garden that he's been bringing up through seven church angels put some right in the midst of her again I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me he comes into his garden again for feast should I preach it again when I preached last night the big good that big good foundation for the bride's secret feast that's what we're living and that's what we're enjoying because right there right there and I shared this is just burning in my heart I haven't I think I've only gone an hour at this point brother BAM said you could set hour after hour I'm in the after hour and the very beginning here's God's perfect Eden and I just had a few more statements to read before we close she in God's perfect Eden Satan immediately knew that God has a plan God God and he knows God's doing something and God got us for shut all these types and shadows that are laid out but he hides the mystery of Satan his head Satan known what he was doing he would have never done it because the same thing expressed in the in the last Adam had they known that it was God's purpose that he come as a lamb and be crucified Paul said they would have never crucified the Lord of glory and it's the same thing the same language brother branham uses about the seventh seal in about the third pulp the devil could ever get a hold of it he would do great damage that's a paradox because it's been made known unto us but he's saying if the devil could ever get a hold of it the Word of God the true fulfillment of it he could have done great damage in the same way that had the devil fully understood that he was a land to be sacrificed he wouldn't have done it so it's very very intriguing up the language of Scripture and brother Rams language it lines up in these things but here Satan now knows that there's something that the goddess have for chaton that God's doing and he wants to interrupt God's program and he wants to institute his own because we understand he wanted to exalt himself above the stars of God but Satan could not create and then this is where I would love to expand upon this more and I'm by no means asking to be invited back but God says that only God could dwell in human flesh he said he reserved that right to himself alone so Satan could not inhabit the woman same could not Rhian habit the man but he could inhabit the serpent and by inhabiting the serpent he took a hold of the serpent and by dwelling in the form and flesh of that serpent he preached a message to the woman that caused her to fall and receive seed and in doing so it brought death and then brought forth the son and a child which was perverted and now Satan couldn't well that and immediately he does but he could not dwell in perfect Adam or the perfect woman he could only in dwell hybrid flesh so he couldn't even get in the side inside of Abel he could only get inside this this hybrid flesh and so that's what Satan wanted he couldn't create a kingdom he couldn't create a people he could only pervert and that's how he got access to humanity and that's why you kids even see that the spirit it that same spirit that possesses the the serpent that same spirit can possess the swine there why because he could inhabit the serpent to begin with but it's through the high breeding the mongrelized of the blood that's what Gabe's saying access to hybrid human but the perfect man that's reserved for God alone hallelujah thank God for a new birth thank God for the sealing of the womb thank God for the raising up of a super race but the very weight and this is where God's plan is so perfect it takes some six thousand years to build a perfect Eden there's the man there's the woman and a perfect Eden everything bring it forth of its kind and Satan comes down right there and gods eaten inhabits the form of what would look like a man and upright beast and he preaches a sermon to the woman that causes her to receive his seed and bring forth death after six thousand years and what was what was God allowing to happen a preview after 6,000 years Satan's got his eden a perfect evening just exactly the way he wants it all his perverted seeds bringing forth of its kind and right there in the midst of Satan's Eden God comes down and inhabits the flesh of a prophet who preaches a word to a woman who received seed and brings forth life and will not die God oh how this would end hey man maybe just hold some of that for this afternoon so brother Branham says in Christ revealed in his own word seed down to the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come up through the feet Luther come back out then through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips so now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence does the bride have the mind of Christ yes she does that means he has stepped down into this the intelligence has come what the I brought the intelligence he says it's God himself just skipping now it's God himself it's be coming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through through the churches it's been his government then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning whoa praise the Lord that's what we're facing today the completion of that word why because we have the bridegroom revealing we have the bride coming on the scene brought back together again in a perfect union brings us back to that part of that original condition in the Garden of Eden man and woman no wonder he said it's come to an age of the astronaut so it's called an eagle age he says we find over in the Bible we find in Malachi four that were promised that in the last days he likes it likens his profits to Eagles he calls himself an eagle he is the great Jehovah eagle and he calls you Eagles says he is able to achieve to himself a bride he is going to in the last days be able to get a brine that with the ministry that so exactly like a man and his wife becomes one when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one that's the time we're living in it's the invisible union but not just the invisible union the indivisible union cannot be broken up cannot be separated the invisible union the marriage of Christ his bride it is the continuation of the book of Acts but it's not only the continuation of the book of Acts it's the consummation of the book of Acts because we will complete we will fulfill everything in this New Testament that's what he says about this church the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament as we read in the beginning about the purpose of God and put that before you I want to close with this we can invite the musicians to come is that okay to invite the musicians to come he says I join with Joe this is in my Redeemer liveth I joined with job of old I know my Redeemer liveth and at the last day he shall stand on the earth I could see him now the last day staying in the form of his bride the complete body of Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of a bride he says that the purpose that God has I must serve this purpose my whole life must be brought into his purpose and to his program he says each of us is that way could we say that in our hearts today as you stand with me say it in your heart I must serve this purpose because it must serve its purpose it must come to its perfection it must come to manifestation and here we are the bride in the last days fulfilling the original completing the original purpose of the woman and this bride will fulfill all that's in the New Testament oh I thank God that he saved us for this last day that he's raised us up in this last days for this what a great privilege let's bow
