[5:09] thank you for all things and we praise
[5:11] you Lord now just come and speak to us
[5:13] on what to say this afternoon Lord and
[5:16] let your love be with us remember the
[5:18] sick among us you said you would send
[5:20] your word we believe you've done that so
[5:23] now the healing comes forth from the
[5:25] word we love you and we thank you have
[5:27] your way in Jesus name amen
[5:31] Romans 8.
[5:36] and we know that all things work
[5:38] together for good to them that love God
[5:40] to them who are thee called according to
[5:42] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[5:45] also did predestinate what now to be
[5:48] conformed to the image of his son that
[5:50] he might be the firstborn among many
[5:52] Brethren more for whom he did
[5:54] predestinate then he also called and
[5:56] whom he called him he also justified in
[5:59] whom he justified them he also glorified
[6:01] what shall we then say to these things
[6:04] if God be for us who can be against us
[6:07] you may be seated the Lord had his
[6:09] Blessing to the reading of the word
[6:13] now I hope you
[6:15] will
[6:18] you know go over again and listen to
[6:20] what we was trying to say this morning
[6:22] I don't want to back up much
[6:24] but
[6:26] you know I believe that was a
[6:28] point that we needed
[6:31] where we were talking about the morning
[6:32] Stars
[6:33] you know saying together and the sons of
[6:36] God shouted for joy
[6:37] and we found that
[6:39] the prophet said that was in God's
[6:41] thinking that was in heaven back before
[6:44] anything whatsoever that was even before
[6:48] the Angels were created before anything
[6:51] came into being
[6:52] that was in God's mind that he saw
[6:56] but now being in God's mind
[7:00] he saw all the way down
[7:04] to the end
[7:06] he saw where we're at
[7:08] he saw all of the journey
[7:10] now we're going to this afternoon kind
[7:13] of start
[7:14] dropping downward to be able to uh come
[7:19] back down to where they were at you know
[7:22] if you're up flying in an airplane uh
[7:25] you know after a while you're gonna uh
[7:27] you you've if you're gonna land you've
[7:29] got to start descending you know and and
[7:31] getting ready and uh you know you start
[7:34] flying little breaks or at least letting
[7:36] off the gas so you know we're going to
[7:38] try to begin downwardly
[7:41] toward where we're at and I don't know
[7:44] how many services it will take but uh
[7:47] what does it matter if we preach from
[7:48] now to the Rapture uh I think it's a
[7:51] very good thing
[7:53] and I hope you caught the point that I
[7:55] was stressing at the end I know I spent
[7:57] I spent a lot of times
[7:59] too much time in the background I guess
[8:02] and not enough time in the actual of the
[8:05] point of what I'm wanting you to see and
[8:08] uh you know I pray that the background
[8:10] does that to set us up
[8:13] but see I believe that actually by being
[8:16] a part of God
[8:18] the eternal life now that we received by
[8:21] New Birth
[8:23] we did not come into the world with
[8:24] eternal life in our soul I do not
[8:26] believe that
[8:27] I believe you must be born again to be
[8:30] able to receive eternal life if not
[8:33] Jesus Christ died in vain see there
[8:36] wouldn't have been any doings we didn't
[8:37] need him if we already had eternal life
[8:39] but you know
[8:41] without getting back too much into the
[8:44] message part but see I believe then that
[8:46] that eternal life
[8:49] was a part of God
[8:51] and that before the world he could in
[8:53] his mind
[8:54] the not just look down and see so when
[8:59] we we start with a message here we're
[9:01] going to start with a point of saying
[9:03] something like this that and you'll hear
[9:06] me when you get to it that brought
[9:07] around and said God knew we'd fall
[9:09] wait but now when I get to one quote in
[9:13] here you got to hold on real tight
[9:14] because see because he said the original
[9:16] creation couldn't fall
[9:19] right so we're going to have to come
[9:21] down correctly
[9:22] to be able to get to the place to where
[9:26] that we can can see it what I believe is
[9:28] correctly
[9:30] you know and and God can help us all
[9:32] right but see being a part of God then
[9:36] if God saw the Plan of Redemption
[9:40] would it be any problem to say that we
[9:42] as a part of God the Eternal life that
[9:45] we have
[9:46] now by the new birth
[9:49] that that eternal life that we have in
[9:51] us actually
[9:53] knew the plan
[9:57] that's why that we've we've got to get
[9:59] to the word redeem
[10:03] you know that's what I'm saying I've got
[10:05] a long ways to go and I don't want to go
[10:07] too fast because sometimes I click over
[10:09] too far and telling you it doesn't work
[10:12] out but we've got to get to the word
[10:13] redeem
[10:15] and redeem means to go back where you
[10:17] came from
[10:19] all right
[10:21] see then we've got to have a place to go
[10:23] back to
[10:25] or you can't cover the word Redemption
[10:28] well see this just to go back as
[10:30] something God thought of
[10:35] just as a thought in you know God just
[10:37] taught us something he thought of a
[10:39] people
[10:40] you know
[10:42] well you know that would be as far as we
[10:43] could go
[10:47] and that wouldn't be redeemed
[10:51] right you understand see there's a lot
[10:52] of things that we've got to cover I say
[10:55] a few things to make your thinking go
[10:56] ahead but then you know you have to back
[10:59] up and and begin to think on about these
[11:02] things and to seeing where we're living
[11:06] and to see that actually what we were
[11:08] saying this morning that
[11:10] Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain
[11:12] before the foundation world the prophet
[11:13] said that would be when they would begin
[11:16] to see the Plan of Redemption
[11:18] but that was not an actual happening
[11:22] that was not a physical part
[11:25] it would be in God's mind
[11:28] all right
[11:30] that he could see these things and and
[11:33] know that it would happen before
[11:36] you know
[11:37] but he would actually see now let me say
[11:41] this and I'll try to get away from
[11:42] to me now to to think about an attribute
[11:45] of God
[11:46] he wanted to display his attributes all
[11:49] right uh
[11:51] that would be his thoughts his thinking
[11:54] about it and it would be more than just
[11:56] him thinking about it
[11:59] you know we get it in that we're
[12:01] thinking about something but see God
[12:03] doesn't have to think about it
[12:05] his first thought was perfect
[12:08] so then if he ever had any thoughts
[12:14] of being a father
[12:17] that thought would be eternal
[12:23] okay
[12:26] and see if these thoughts eternal
[12:30] then those who make him a father
[12:33] would they not be as Eternal as he is
[12:39] so then
[12:40] we in him
[12:43] and not in no other way
[12:45] we in him
[12:48] was not just his something he thought of
[12:53] I'm trying to get that part to you over
[12:55] and over
[12:56] we are not just what he thought of
[13:01] that would cause us to have a beginning
[13:06] if we have a beginning we can have an
[13:08] ending
[13:11] but if we're of the very thought that he
[13:13] had
[13:15] and that is us
[13:17] not just flesh not this part here
[13:21] but the eternal life that's living in US
[13:28] then if God
[13:31] now I'm questioning it to you
[13:35] if God knew the Plan of Redemption
[13:40] and we'd have to know he did you know
[13:42] right
[13:44] well you see when we was a part of him
[13:48] would not give us a contact to him more
[13:51] than we could ever think of in life
[13:54] we'll get around to it where the Prophet
[13:56] said
[13:57] you know and I quoted the other day he
[13:59] said
[13:59] you know and everybody else was going
[14:01] out and just Raising Cane and doing
[14:03] things said there's something about you
[14:12] even as we were saying this morning of
[14:14] what did Hebrews 14 or Hebrews 1 14.
[14:19] where those angels are ministering
[14:22] spirits to ministers to the hours of
[14:25] salvation
[14:27] I believe that when you come into the
[14:29] world as a baby
[14:32] that you that would ever be born again
[14:34] that God right there would have
[14:36] everything right in motion
[14:37] and he'd make sure that that come out
[14:39] right
[14:43] he said no he doesn't have to do that no
[14:44] he doesn't have to do that but he sure
[14:46] loves to do it
[14:47] he didn't have to go down to Sodom
[14:51] right but what'd he say he said I've
[14:54] come down to see if the things that are
[14:57] told me now who told him him things
[15:02] he said to see whether it's right or not
[15:06] that's why I love him so much he's not
[15:07] going to stay up in heaven
[15:09] he'll never once him attributes started
[15:12] coming this way that's what I read to
[15:14] you this morning he'll never be alone
[15:16] again
[15:21] once he in his mind if you want to just
[15:23] say it
[15:25] it's all the morning stars singing and
[15:27] the Son of God shouting for Joy he will
[15:29] never be alone from then on
[15:35] because he's bringing into being
[15:39] his people
[15:43] eternal life is more than just a thought
[15:45] or a talking for me
[15:47] it's a person
[15:49] and that person is almighty God
[15:52] now living in you and I you know
[15:55] multiple membered body which means that
[15:58] we only get a part
[15:59] right that Jesus had it all but all of
[16:02] our parts go together and make him
[16:06] see it then if we do then
[16:09] God had attributes he had thoughts
[16:14] he had within him the attribute of
[16:16] Savior healer and Redeemer
[16:19] he had done already
[16:22] because he knew what he was going to do
[16:27] and we get to it in a minute he knew we
[16:29] would fall
[16:30] oh but brother Dale I can't fall that's
[16:34] where the people of the message I'm
[16:35] sealed in Satan's sealed out I can't
[16:37] fall
[16:40] don't Crow too much
[16:44] right
[16:48] don't grow too much
[16:49] God just might let us know where we
[16:52] stand
[16:54] but just think about it now
[16:56] he wanted them attributes to be
[16:58] displayed
[17:01] right
[17:04] and wanting them attributes to be
[17:06] displayed we are now seeing
[17:13] right now come on
[17:15] now we we talked about salvation right
[17:19] we talked about being born again we
[17:21] talked about being Christians right
[17:23] but now since you've come into this
[17:25] message what has the whole thing been
[17:26] especially since you've been at Lula
[17:29] let's I decided to put it that away
[17:31] because I ain't nowhere else
[17:33] what's always been our thought around
[17:35] here
[17:36] Redemption
[17:39] salvation
[17:42] revelation
[17:47] until we become intellectual
[17:49] know-it-alls
[17:52] right
[17:54] right well just leave them alone darly
[17:56] just a bunch of intellect well all right
[17:59] at least we still got the same thought
[18:01] we've had 40 years
[18:04] I want to get out of here don't you
[18:10] all right
[18:11] then I believe we are now seeing the
[18:14] Plan of Redemption coming into view
[18:17] that I've ended up this morning saying
[18:19] see even at Calvary even up to their
[18:22] Pentecost
[18:23] the best Paul and him could do was
[18:25] prophesy of a time to come when the body
[18:29] would be changed
[18:32] there was no way to go into that
[18:37] he could only be a prophecy of a future
[18:39] event
[18:40] but a prophecy to Paul
[18:45] he could look down and see somebody
[18:47] being changed or something right
[18:50] well what's the difference in that and
[18:51] Paul and God looking down
[18:56] and seeing us redeemed
[18:58] seeing us shouting in our Redemption
[19:04] to realize we're redeemed
[19:07] I love that Psalm don't you I'm redeemed
[19:10] my love divine
[19:13] Glory Glory
[19:15] Christ is mine
[19:17] see under him I just put everything
[19:20] all right
[19:22] but now listen this is the thought I
[19:24] want you to keep in mind
[19:28] we are now seeing the Plan of Redemption
[19:33] all right
[19:35] now not just because we read about it
[19:39] and talk about it
[19:40] but being a born-again experience within
[19:43] our soul
[19:45] it's more than just being a
[19:48] concept
[19:50] you go down don't throw off on nobody if
[19:53] you go right over here and he may be
[19:55] preaching on chains in a moment a
[19:56] twinkle of an eye
[20:01] right
[20:03] but do they know what they're talking
[20:04] about or is it just
[20:06] knowledge
[20:08] that they have received
[20:11] we're not may not know much about it
[20:13] ourselves but somebody
[20:15] knows a little bit about that somewhere
[20:17] but it's going to take place one of
[20:19] these days and I just contend we're part
[20:22] of it all right
[20:24] now and if we're seeing now the complete
[20:27] Plan of Redemption
[20:30] yeah
[20:32] I know this is a funny way of saying it
[20:34] and I know I'm funny
[20:37] and I don't know anything about music so
[20:39] forgive me
[20:42] but the first church age would only sing
[20:45] their part
[20:49] you understand
[20:52] we just come through the church ages you
[20:54] know the second Church of age could just
[20:56] sing their part
[20:58] Satan got in and it went to going down
[21:00] right
[21:02] but when Luther came out he preached the
[21:04] just shall live by faith he was singing
[21:06] the song of redemption
[21:10] and that's what God saw in his mind
[21:12] before the world
[21:16] us singing
[21:20] but what about a group that winds up to
[21:23] be able to sing the complete plan
[21:25] of redemption
[21:28] I know Sister Gail don't mind me saying
[21:30] that but she used to sing in Atlanta
[21:31] Christian choir
[21:33] and they got where they're singing
[21:35] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[21:38] she just just lift hers out you know
[21:41] then she just finally quit
[21:44] why because you just learned it that's
[21:46] not right
[21:49] see it's the Plan of Redemption
[21:52] being made known
[21:54] all right
[21:56] now here's one I want you to lock in
[21:58] write it down or whatever
[22:03] God
[22:05] is we'll cover knew that we would fall
[22:10] but he couldn't just start off in any
[22:12] way
[22:14] to let that be he couldn't throw a
[22:17] sinner on the Earth
[22:19] and then say I'm going to save him
[22:23] he couldn't do it that way
[22:27] now the old argument of which came first
[22:30] the chicken or the egg
[22:33] you've heard that argued you know
[22:37] well now God never made eggs
[22:41] he made chickens it doesn't say that he
[22:45] made an animal you know he made eggs and
[22:48] they all hatched out to be chickens
[22:52] he made full-grown chickens
[22:56] all right
[22:58] so when he started the human race
[23:03] I want you to write this thought down in
[23:05] your mind
[23:06] he never started the human race with a
[23:08] bunch of novice
[23:10] little baby kids
[23:13] to grow up
[23:16] he started with Adam
[23:18] a full-grown manifested Son of God
[23:25] because no creation of God starts with a
[23:28] baby
[23:30] he said well it did when now come on
[23:32] with
[23:33] you receive the earnest that's a baby
[23:35] right why because we're in the fall
[23:43] see we're in the fall but when he
[23:45] started the human race
[23:47] he started with Adam and we'll get back
[23:49] to him after a while in the message
[23:53] and Adam was God's
[23:57] example son
[24:03] right
[24:05] he would love for all of his sons and
[24:07] daughters to be like Adam
[24:12] then when Jesus came he was the real
[24:13] promised son the real example
[24:17] all right
[24:19] write that down or think about it
[24:23] and just consider the point
[24:28] and you'll see when I get on the end of
[24:30] the message just a little bit you'll see
[24:32] why I'm emphasizing that
[24:36] because
[24:39] you go back to the morning message
[24:44] that eternal life that you have
[24:47] never had a beginning
[24:52] so did he start with children
[25:04] I'll let that Coast a little
[25:09] Adam was full grown
[25:14] Adam was his example son
[25:18] the fall brought babies
[25:26] right
[25:28] so then
[25:33] thinking about
[25:36] Redemption
[25:38] you wouldn't want to go back to a baby
[25:43] right
[25:47] just dropping little thoughts in for
[25:50] about 10 sermons down the road somewhere
[25:52] maybe
[25:55] you want to go back to a full grown
[26:02] so then Adam would have been his example
[26:04] son Jesus Christ was him
[26:10] but then in the point of thinking about
[26:12] being a part of God
[26:17] not thinking about peoples
[26:20] that's where we want to get to all this
[26:21] thing we want to get this ego we want to
[26:23] get this thing into being you know
[26:27] the eternal life that we have
[26:31] there is no such thing as a baby form of
[26:35] eternal life
[26:41] there's people who receive eternal life
[26:43] that all of us are babies
[26:45] right
[26:48] but you don't have
[26:50] and even apart
[26:52] is we'll get to it and keep on having to
[26:55] say
[26:57] brother said one little speck of
[27:00] eternal life is
[27:03] eternal life
[27:05] just because you call it apart
[27:10] if you understand why did John what did
[27:12] he do when he went to Patmos
[27:15] he represented the bride right
[27:18] one man
[27:22] with a part of God
[27:25] whatever the part does
[27:28] right she's gonna do
[27:33] are you with me
[27:35] giving you things to think about
[27:44] what you see Church
[27:47] nothing is pulling anything over on God
[27:53] and he knew all of this before by his
[27:55] foreknowledge
[27:58] all that would ever take place on Earth
[28:01] I had for knowledge
[28:03] he would know that
[28:05] remember what we said foreknowledge was
[28:07] knowledge before of something that
[28:10] transpires
[28:13] so if we were shouting in the mind of
[28:16] God
[28:17] it means we would have to come forth to
[28:20] be shouting in the physical
[28:24] right
[28:28] just little thoughts
[28:30] all right
[28:32] now let's begin just a thought this
[28:34] afternoon
[28:40] we've maybe re-read some of these but
[28:43] you know what we've quoted on most of it
[28:45] and we've been through it
[28:49] God couldn't make a man a sinner
[28:54] and then save him
[28:57] he couldn't make him a sinner so that he
[28:59] could come down to save him
[29:02] what would he make it out of
[29:06] how would he make a sinner
[29:10] he can't make a sinner
[29:17] he he wouldn't at all be saved
[29:21] right
[29:23] but he knew
[29:24] what would take place
[29:27] all right so let's think about this now
[29:29] as we start coming downward a little
[29:31] from the eternities
[29:36] and coming down to like he says on
[29:38] Christ the mystery God reveal
[29:40] that God had a plan and a purpose
[29:43] we've been over that
[29:47] he had a plan and purpose in order to
[29:48] let himself be expressed
[29:53] all right
[29:54] pull that nut brother
[29:58] I guess where the Bob's on it today
[30:00] okay
[30:02] pull number one up because I want you to
[30:04] read something
[30:06] try not to read all and do everything
[30:08] but
[30:09] he had a motive and going to the back
[30:12] part of God's mind we've been over that
[30:13] he had a motive into it in order to let
[30:15] him be expressed then when the moon it
[30:17] wouldn't start he wasn't even God he was
[30:19] actually actually wasn't God at the time
[30:21] because God is an object of worship in
[30:23] his great mind he wanted these
[30:25] attributes to be expressed and in him
[30:27] was loving him was to be father in him
[30:29] was to be son in him was to be savior in
[30:32] him was to be a Healer and all of these
[30:34] great attributes that we see already
[30:36] expressed they were in God all right
[30:39] think about it now
[30:41] so to my opinion the first thing he's
[30:43] made was uh let's see go on
[30:47] roll it up
[30:49] the other way somewhere up or down one
[30:53] paragraph 105 is what I'm wanting us
[30:55] there
[30:56] Earth 104.
[30:58] background 104. that's what we want
[31:00] all right there wasn't no sun no moon no
[31:03] start or nothing
[31:05] and he asked Joe
[31:07] where was you when I laid the foundation
[31:09] of the world
[31:10] now my point
[31:12] is to think
[31:15] in a prophet getting a revelation from
[31:18] God about the Plan of Redemption the
[31:20] doings and right in the point that he's
[31:23] explaining the mind
[31:25] he's explaining the back part of God's
[31:27] mind he's explaining that God is eternal
[31:31] he's explaining that he had a motive in
[31:33] doing it to be his savior healer loving
[31:36] he turned right back and goes to job
[31:43] where was you when I laid the foundation
[31:44] world when the morning started staying
[31:46] together the Son of God shouted for Joy
[31:48] where was you that was way back before
[31:50] the Earth
[31:52] all right
[31:54] God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery
[32:02] so think about what it was
[32:06] paragraph 106 wrote it on up let's get
[32:08] that
[32:11] 105 excuse me
[32:13] God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery
[32:16] that's what I want to speak on to the
[32:17] church this morning the hidden Mystery
[32:19] of God that he had in his mind before
[32:21] the world ever begun
[32:23] and how that it's unfolded now if it's
[32:25] the Plan of Redemption what I just
[32:27] unfolded itself right down to this
[32:29] present time
[32:30] that's what I'm saying
[32:33] the first church age could only sing
[32:35] what they could sing
[32:36] this Plan of Redemption is a seven full
[32:39] Glory of his person for each one of the
[32:42] ages to sing their part
[32:44] all right
[32:46] unfolded itself right down to where we
[32:48] are
[32:49] roll up number two look at it paragraph
[32:51] 168 Christ of Mystery
[32:54] oh the great revelation
[32:58] now now to restore back his kinship
[33:03] to bring back
[33:05] now he he had to let them get lost
[33:09] you understand it
[33:11] he had to let them sin
[33:15] they'll think about what we're doing
[33:17] put them on free moral he could not make
[33:19] them sin and remain God he didn't punish
[33:21] them for something
[33:23] he made them do
[33:27] but what he put man on partnership with
[33:29] him
[33:30] and he didn't let him act as a free more
[33:32] Legion
[33:33] the same same thing he's got you at high
[33:35] on today
[33:35] acting well you want to you're a free
[33:37] moral agent
[33:39] but it's free moral agents
[33:43] to give you a choice
[33:46] all right
[33:48] then
[33:50] it would be necessary
[33:54] that if it was going to be a people that
[33:56] fall
[33:59] for him to come and pay the price
[34:03] he can't make us fall
[34:06] he couldn't make Adam and Eve fall he
[34:08] made Adam perfect
[34:12] his body wasn't eternal
[34:14] but it so was
[34:17] right
[34:18] made him perfect
[34:21] nothing couldn't be added to their
[34:23] beauty their doings or whatever
[34:29] and as he done that he gave them a
[34:31] choice
[34:34] and by giving a choice
[34:38] if I don't get back to it
[34:40] would have ran them on marriage and
[34:41] divorce he said see there see that's why
[34:44] the woman was not in the original
[34:45] creation
[34:49] because she was the first one to
[34:51] exercise her choice
[34:54] she was the first one to exercise her
[34:56] Fremont agency
[34:58] to choose wrong
[35:01] but then Adam chose wrong
[35:04] we don't blame Eve all together we just
[35:06] know that that's where it started
[35:10] but did he make her sinful
[35:15] you got a problem if he made her sinful
[35:19] but these are the words of the prophet
[35:21] he made her in a way
[35:23] she could do what she done
[35:26] amen
[35:27] right he knew she would do what she
[35:29] would do
[35:33] he knew if he left Adam in the garden
[35:36] there would be no sin
[35:39] all right
[35:42] so he gave him a help meet
[35:45] and that caused the fall
[35:48] all right
[35:50] but now what's the point I'm kind of
[35:53] here and then we're going to drop over
[35:58] because I want you to think with me a
[36:00] little I'm setting up the thought to
[36:02] where when we get to the way Adam was
[36:04] created first
[36:06] all right
[36:09] how was he created first
[36:11] a spiritual being
[36:13] so but we're over here getting lined up
[36:16] where you won't misunderstand me
[36:19] all right
[36:21] because I believe we must understand
[36:26] that God could not create us wrong
[36:30] he said well we just go to the creation
[36:35] I wanted it into your mind to stay in
[36:37] your mind
[36:39] that God couldn't create us wrong
[36:46] create
[36:52] Eve he made her beautiful made her right
[36:56] had she stayed with God
[37:02] there would have been no fall right
[37:04] right
[37:08] but there had to be a way for God to get
[37:10] this to going and how could he get it
[37:12] going
[37:16] and we're going to drop over and see
[37:17] what really happened
[37:20] we're going to talk about Adam in a way
[37:21] maybe that you hadn't thought about him
[37:29] but you see
[37:31] Adam couldn't fall
[37:36] it was the helpmate
[37:42] it was the bringing forth of Eve
[37:45] and now I'm telling you I believe it I
[37:48] believe Eve had eternal life in her soul
[37:52] and that's why I warn people oh if I got
[37:55] eternal life I can't fall you're right
[37:57] in the death trap of the devil to get
[37:59] you
[38:02] I say it this way by God's grace I won't
[38:05] fall
[38:10] he'll keep me
[38:13] and if he can't keep me he'll take me
[38:15] off the scene because he ain't gonna let
[38:18] me marry his name
[38:20] all right
[38:22] but it may be an odd way of thinking
[38:23] about it but
[38:26] you'll see in a minute when we pick up
[38:28] and you'll see this morning's message
[38:30] come right into view
[38:34] because you couldn't start with Adam
[38:37] as being a baby
[38:41] he was God's first creation
[38:45] if you want to call him he was God's
[38:46] first son
[38:51] come on you want to quote
[38:53] let everyone said Adam was God's first
[38:55] son he said Jesus was his begotten
[39:03] the Adam
[39:05] even though he had eternal life he was
[39:07] not God
[39:10] but Jesus was
[39:13] now
[39:14] so get the point
[39:19] he would have to give
[39:23] this creation
[39:28] the choice of free more agency
[39:33] and not make a way that Eve would fall
[39:40] he made her perfect
[39:45] he made her the most beautiful of all
[39:50] but he knew by making her
[39:53] she would be the one that would cause
[39:54] Adam to fall
[39:57] that's no problem is it sisters
[40:00] that's not degrading you
[40:03] you know why because on the other hand
[40:05] you're a top of the bride of Christ
[40:07] which is the most beautiful woman in the
[40:09] Bible
[40:13] so don't think I'm throwing off on you
[40:17] it's just the truth of what happened
[40:22] if Eve had not have been in Adam
[40:25] you could change things around
[40:28] but Eve was in Adam
[40:32] but when she was taken from Adam
[40:36] is when the possibility of the Fall came
[40:38] into being
[40:40] now
[40:45] but you think about it
[40:50] God knew we would fall
[40:54] now
[40:57] let's don't get on the wrong thing
[40:59] that's what I'm trying to say it huh
[41:02] we think well he made that woman over
[41:04] there but that's what he made the fall
[41:05] right there
[41:07] no
[41:15] he didn't make her that away you got it
[41:16] all messed up
[41:20] he can't make her that away he's God he
[41:22] can't make something wrong
[41:25] but yet he knows that's the only way
[41:28] that it could come into being
[41:31] that he would be a redeemer
[41:34] A Healer
[41:41] and if we were there in a part of him
[41:43] like we were talking about this morning
[41:44] then we ought to know ourselves
[41:48] that there was no other way he could do
[41:49] it
[41:52] he couldn't make anything wrong
[41:57] and be God
[42:02] but he knows that if he made us
[42:06] now that's a strong statement
[42:09] that sounds like he's predestinating us
[42:13] that's the reason I'm trying to get this
[42:14] out of the way before we get to Genesis
[42:16] 1.
[42:17] if I just preached this evening on this
[42:19] I'd be all right we'll get Genesis one
[42:20] Wednesday
[42:27] how would it be that God would know we
[42:29] would fall
[42:33] but not predestinators to fall
[42:37] there's a difference in you
[42:39] because predestinating with me
[42:41] determining it he would be making you
[42:43] fall
[42:44] that's the point I'm trying to get
[42:46] across this afternoon
[42:49] God never made us to fall
[42:53] he made us perfect but he knew we would
[42:58] and I like to put it this way don't run
[43:01] out there now and say I'm saved it don't
[43:04] matter what I do
[43:12] I wouldn't want a child like that would
[43:14] you
[43:17] but you see for him to know what we
[43:20] would do
[43:22] is different from him making us do it
[43:31] take the Holy Ghost away from you right
[43:33] now or me either one we're nothing but
[43:35] an animal
[43:39] oh no I would do it
[43:43] that's where you're in a trap of the
[43:44] devil
[43:48] you'd be like the lady was that right
[43:49] around spoke of you know that used to
[43:51] dance and think oh I used to do that but
[43:54] I don't want to do it but I'll just sit
[43:56] down and listen here a little bit you
[43:57] know and I'll just stay right here and
[43:59] I'll listen a little bit
[44:01] well you know I can witness to them
[44:03] about Jesus
[44:05] you know what
[44:07] first thing you know she's in a man's
[44:08] arms
[44:12] I didn't go and see because I didn't
[44:15] care but
[44:16] you heard a lot of stories about the
[44:18] lady that
[44:20] used to do striptease Acts
[44:24] and then she went and sat down and
[44:25] talked to everybody about the Lord
[44:31] now what are you being saved from you
[44:33] know
[44:34] but you get the point
[44:38] so think with the idea of what I'm
[44:41] trying to say
[44:43] by giving us a choice
[44:47] he knew we'd take the wrong choice
[44:51] but now listen
[44:56] the part of God
[44:58] that we spoke of this morning
[45:03] never made the wrong choice
[45:11] okay
[45:12] the part of God we were talking about
[45:14] this morning
[45:16] the sons of God shouting for joy
[45:19] you can't make that make a wrong choice
[45:29] but if you can put that in flesh
[45:34] and let flesh go through a lot of
[45:36] problems
[45:40] like I said
[45:41] you take the Holy Ghost out right now
[45:46] and we'd be killing each other in an
[45:47] hour
[45:51] right amen
[45:56] no no brother I'm just making that a
[45:58] point it might be true
[46:01] right
[46:05] now see God knew we would fall
[46:11] they couldn't make us fall
[46:15] but he knew we would
[46:20] but he knew also
[46:24] that if he didn't bring us into being
[46:28] no matter what he knew we would do
[46:33] he knew
[46:35] that he would never be a savior
[46:40] right
[46:45] so come on he knew that he had to permit
[46:48] us
[46:49] to come into being
[46:57] so take on this now let's get a little
[46:59] bit of let's just read about these
[47:01] things look look at number four brother
[47:03] let's go to that one
[47:08] because that's all I want to get in your
[47:09] mind maybe this today
[47:14] we'll go come back to number three
[47:16] excuse me
[47:19] which is taken from
[47:21] water baptism preached 1961 1119 E36
[47:26] and as God in the beginning knowed that
[47:28] man would fall
[47:31] therefore he could put him on free more
[47:33] agency
[47:35] knowing because he would display his
[47:39] attributes to be father
[47:43] he knew it fall
[47:46] but that was the only way he could be
[47:47] father to be son to be healer to be a
[47:50] savior
[47:51] how could he save that something's lost
[47:54] and then God was the attributes
[47:57] before there even was an angel or a
[47:59] molecule or anything
[48:01] God was by himself alone but he wasn't
[48:03] God because
[48:04] God is an object of worship there was
[48:06] nothing to worship nothing to worship
[48:08] him but his attributes his attributes
[48:10] displayed something and made an angel
[48:15] then he was God
[48:17] then he made a man give him three more
[48:19] agency
[48:21] he's just playing it the angels
[48:26] how would they be an attribute
[48:29] because he created them
[48:34] hold your point
[48:37] they were not attributes as the
[48:39] attributes of God they were only the
[48:41] thoughts of God
[48:45] Judas was a thought of God right
[48:48] are you with me
[48:50] but he was not an attribute of God
[48:55] come on
[48:57] he was the thought of God
[48:59] the Angels were thoughts because they're
[49:01] not redeemable
[49:05] those one-third that fell after Satan's
[49:08] lie can never be redeemed
[49:13] angels are not human beings
[49:16] they're an attribute because they made
[49:18] him a creator
[49:22] because he created the angels
[49:25] but like I said you show me now in the
[49:27] Bible the message where he created me
[49:29] and you
[49:33] oh now I know he created us in His image
[49:35] and I know that so we're going to get
[49:36] down to that later but I'm just making a
[49:38] point what did he say
[49:42] now he also knowed that there had to be
[49:44] a lost people
[49:47] and to save people
[49:50] at the same time he knew that we would
[49:52] fall
[49:55] he knew he would redeem us
[49:59] but he knew some people
[50:01] would never be redeemed
[50:05] right
[50:07] okay going back to his infinite
[50:10] all right
[50:12] going down now to number four
[50:14] this is uh Revelations chapter 5 61 6
[50:18] 18.
[50:20] God knowing that man would fall yet he
[50:23] could not make man fall God knowing man
[50:26] would be lost though he did not want
[50:28] anybody lost
[50:30] but to order that he the great display
[50:32] of the attributes of God might be
[50:34] manifested to all men that he could be a
[50:37] redeemer he could be a savior
[50:40] man had to fall
[50:46] it was in him to fall
[50:51] right
[50:54] then it was in God to redeem him again
[50:58] that's the we have to have not time to
[51:02] display you say well
[51:05] he had to fall
[51:07] it was in him to fall
[51:11] see once he put us into the world
[51:15] he knew what was going to do
[51:18] right
[51:21] not being carnal in our wrong saying but
[51:24] he made Adam and Eve
[51:28] the way he knew
[51:30] he he didn't make them with parts shy
[51:35] and then made them with other parts to
[51:37] make the fall
[51:39] right not being too wrong on it saying
[51:42] it
[51:44] he made him go they knew what it's going
[51:45] to do
[51:47] right well why didn't he just keep them
[51:49] from doing it
[51:53] because he could have never been a
[51:54] savior
[51:58] right
[52:01] so his attributes required
[52:03] something to be lost
[52:07] so he could display that one
[52:13] then he would have to make
[52:16] man
[52:19] in the right condition
[52:23] if you move in any form from that right
[52:25] condition of making man you're going to
[52:28] make him one way or the other
[52:30] you'll be wrong
[52:34] he said well why didn't he just sleep
[52:36] well he could have left Adam by himself
[52:42] he could have done that
[52:45] but now remember
[52:47] it was in him to fall
[52:54] now you know that I preached a little
[52:56] bit different most preachers who you
[52:58] just got to put up with it
[53:02] we blame Eve as I said while ago for the
[53:04] whole thing
[53:06] that byproduct you gave me
[53:15] can I quote a quote and then seemingly
[53:17] tear it apart
[53:19] original creation can't fall
[53:25] but Adam did
[53:33] you going to argue with me
[53:36] you can't argue the point right
[53:42] so it was in Adam
[53:49] it wasn't something wrong with Adam
[53:53] it wasn't something wrong with Eve
[53:57] see you're making them
[53:59] do something and that's not in God
[54:07] you can argue how children would have
[54:08] been born had there been no fall you got
[54:10] a hypothetical point to talk about and
[54:13] it's totally hypothetical because it
[54:15] didn't happen
[54:16] right so it never was going to happen
[54:24] but you we say Eve then well Eve was it
[54:27] Eve had the ability to fall Adam
[54:29] followed her
[54:36] amen
[54:40] so Brothers
[54:43] don't run down to the nearest Honky Tonk
[54:46] to talk to the naked women about the
[54:48] Lord
[54:53] is that blunt enough
[55:00] amen right why
[55:03] because you're a man
[55:06] Adam was a man
[55:11] the reason the prophet would say it that
[55:14] the original creation can't fall is
[55:16] because there was no ability for Satan
[55:19] to be able to get into his mind
[55:28] well brother Lee Vale used to preach you
[55:30] know life about it and how much I know I
[55:32] don't know where it's true or not I
[55:33] remember that but
[55:35] he had a he had a male Serpent and a
[55:38] female serpent
[55:40] and some of you may have heard that
[55:42] and he had that old male serpent dancing
[55:45] around Eve and he had that female
[55:47] dancing around Adam
[55:49] was the adamant now no perversion
[55:55] he wasn't exercising free more agency
[55:59] and his flues had not been stopped up
[56:02] do you understand what happened to Eve
[56:06] Satan began to reason in her mind
[56:13] until he brought her into a condition
[56:16] but you know what
[56:19] after Eve done what she done
[56:22] some way she got Adam to do what he done
[56:27] and there was two kids born
[56:29] one from the Beast and one from Adam you
[56:32] got no argument
[56:37] that's why I'm blunt
[56:39] because you don't argue points then
[56:42] well it could have been
[56:44] no it couldn't have been because that's
[56:47] what took place
[56:51] Adam was there in a position or
[56:53] condition
[56:56] he could not be tempted
[57:01] let's put it this way Jesus was in that
[57:03] condition
[57:04] you agree with that
[57:06] he could be tempted but not sin
[57:11] Adam was a human you might could talk
[57:13] about him ability to be tempted by a
[57:15] female serpent or whatever you don't do
[57:18] but he wouldn't sin because his flus was
[57:21] not stopped up
[57:22] see Satan knew exactly how to get to Eve
[57:26] it wasn't Eve was made so uh you know
[57:30] until she just
[57:34] grabbed the Beast
[57:40] no he slowly
[57:42] planted within her mind
[57:46] you fathers you see them boys hanging
[57:49] around them girls
[57:50] you watch them
[57:52] they start acting different
[57:56] no boys making an inroad
[58:04] trying to be a pastor without being
[58:07] vulgar
[58:10] listen trying to preach Redemption
[58:14] we're trying to find out what the fall
[58:16] was
[58:19] because when we get over to Adam
[58:24] we're going to have Adam and Eve
[58:27] in the garden
[58:31] with no ability to fall
[58:45] you see where we're going next
[58:55] because Adam and Eve and theophany
[58:56] couldn't fall
[59:00] okie dokie
[59:02] you see where we're going
[59:05] just want to get this point though the
[59:06] word that we don't think about
[59:08] but I can't fall
[59:10] I'm a born-again Christian
[59:15] you're still living in a human body
[59:18] you can still think still think wrong
[59:19] and do think wrong
[59:22] no my thoughts are all pure
[59:25] well pray for me
[59:28] maybe the devil ain't got after you yet
[59:34] we're all human
[59:36] you know what I mean what is it I walk
[59:38] up and I say
[59:40] brother Carly once Wade got against you
[59:43] ah forget it I didn't mean nothing by
[59:47] that you're gonna go and worry about
[59:48] what it is
[59:51] right that'd be the deceiving part
[59:53] right we're all human
[59:57] right nobody run you off the road you
[59:59] don't say praise the Lord Do It Again
[1:00:04] after a while you learn to say
[1:00:06] okay peace
[1:00:09] just don't do it the second time
[1:00:13] we're human right
[1:00:17] so what did he say
[1:00:21] God knowing that man would fall yet he
[1:00:24] could not make man fall
[1:00:27] knowing that man would be lost
[1:00:30] we did not want anybody lost
[1:00:34] me all right
[1:00:37] but in order to be that great display of
[1:00:39] the attributes of God let me manifested
[1:00:42] to all men
[1:00:43] it could be a redeemer it could be a
[1:00:44] savior it could be a Healer
[1:00:46] okay
[1:00:47] go to the next one
[1:00:51] look what he starts off on Christ and Mr
[1:00:53] God reveal paragraph 184 predestinated
[1:00:57] there's the mystery
[1:00:59] all involved in it
[1:01:01] he before Christ or anything else was
[1:01:04] ever on Earth you see his great mystery
[1:01:07] that he chose the bride
[1:01:10] he said when you said this morning he
[1:01:12] didn't choose us
[1:01:15] he also preached two sermons on how you
[1:01:18] were chosen
[1:01:20] now anybody care to answer how we were
[1:01:23] chosen
[1:01:24] in him okay
[1:01:26] so he's not contrary right
[1:01:30] that he chose to brought what knowing
[1:01:32] Eve would fall
[1:01:34] from disbelieving the word
[1:01:37] knowing that she would fall when he
[1:01:39] would choose a bride that would not fall
[1:01:43] a hold of that word
[1:01:45] why because now we have the song to sing
[1:01:50] I'm redeemed
[1:01:53] my love divine
[1:01:56] we got it right now we got to plan a
[1:01:59] Redemption
[1:02:00] go on to the next
[1:02:02] I just want to get a couple of these
[1:02:06] he could not be just and make a man to
[1:02:09] fall he had to put him on equal basis
[1:02:12] a free moral agency
[1:02:16] don't choice but knowing he would follow
[1:02:19] Nikki he can't be a savior unless
[1:02:21] there's something lost he can't be a
[1:02:22] healing this or something sick these
[1:02:24] things had to be that way
[1:02:26] God made them to us so that his great
[1:02:28] attributes could be displayed if there
[1:02:31] wasn't that he he'd never he'd have
[1:02:34] never been a savior
[1:02:36] but we know he was and he is so what has
[1:02:39] it been there had to be something lost
[1:02:40] how is it going to be
[1:02:43] if he takes and loses it just in order
[1:02:46] to save it
[1:02:48] then it isn't Justice on his judgment
[1:02:51] he couldn't send a man to hell and be
[1:02:54] just he's kind gentle true honestly
[1:02:56] great judge
[1:02:58] he'd be working against himself
[1:03:00] so we had to put a man out there
[1:03:02] and make him on three more agency
[1:03:05] so he he would
[1:03:07] knowing
[1:03:08] would fall and the man in his own image
[1:03:17] stopped
[1:03:20] how could he fall
[1:03:24] you see daylight
[1:03:29] you see in daylight in other words your
[1:03:31] eyes opening
[1:03:33] so we had to make a byproduct
[1:03:37] something out of the original creation
[1:03:41] what happened
[1:03:43] knowing it was fault it was put over
[1:03:45] into the hands of Satan
[1:03:46] for a vessel Of Dishonor all right
[1:03:49] now
[1:03:54] three more agency
[1:03:57] knowing it would fall
[1:04:00] what's that and the man in his own image
[1:04:03] how could he fall
[1:04:07] hold your point
[1:04:10] this ain't the man he's talking about
[1:04:16] this ain't the image of God this is an
[1:04:18] image of animal
[1:04:20] you still want to get this out of the
[1:04:21] way and where we can float through
[1:04:24] when we get into the creation of man or
[1:04:27] the bringing of man forth
[1:04:30] we get you to think
[1:04:32] see we're thinking
[1:04:34] and the man in his own image could not
[1:04:36] fall us men couldn't fall
[1:04:39] he's just the more women it fell
[1:04:43] we've made an image of God now wait just
[1:04:45] a cotton picking minute
[1:04:50] what was the image he was made in
[1:04:56] oh
[1:04:58] well I got a quote she was made in the
[1:05:00] image of man thank goodness you read
[1:05:02] so what was the image of Adam
[1:05:10] I'm trying to get you to think
[1:05:16] this is not the image of God
[1:05:19] Adam's standing there in flesh was not
[1:05:21] the image of God
[1:05:23] the Inside Man couldn't follow
[1:05:26] didn't say the outside man couldn't
[1:05:31] okay
[1:05:32] does that click contrary to your
[1:05:34] thinking
[1:05:36] so we got a lot more contrary clickings
[1:05:38] to happen I guess
[1:05:43] and right around him said in a man in
[1:05:45] original creation couldn't fall
[1:05:47] but you didn't think that Adam couldn't
[1:05:49] fall
[1:05:52] was that what you thought
[1:05:54] that was what I thought
[1:05:59] Adam in the image of God can't fall
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:03] Adam and animal image did fall
[1:06:07] all right
[1:06:15] you see we're talking about
[1:06:18] God and his children and
[1:06:21] we're trying not to make us so big
[1:06:25] and whatever we are let him make us what
[1:06:28] we are
[1:06:30] it is he that has made us not we
[1:06:31] ourselves right
[1:06:34] so think about it
[1:06:37] knowing that it would fall
[1:06:42] man and his image couldn't fall
[1:06:47] and it looks it's exactly like he said
[1:06:49] but he made the woman
[1:06:51] and she fell
[1:06:53] Adam did fall
[1:06:58] but the inside of him never failed
[1:07:06] the one that was created in the image of
[1:07:08] God did not fall
[1:07:10] the one that was created an image of
[1:07:12] animal fail
[1:07:16] as I said Adam was made
[1:07:21] but yet he was not seduced in his mind
[1:07:23] his mind had not been perverted
[1:07:26] so it was displayed from his inward body
[1:07:29] out into the outward part of him
[1:07:35] he finally got to him
[1:07:40] Satan got to Eve
[1:07:43] uh what is it right around on is it
[1:07:46] Blasphemous name where he said Satan
[1:07:48] stopped up her flus
[1:07:53] you know he got into her spirit realm
[1:07:55] reasoning memory conscious affections
[1:07:56] Etc
[1:07:58] well don't you think that it eventually
[1:08:00] got into Adam's memory reason conscious
[1:08:02] affection
[1:08:04] because he had a child by Eve
[1:08:08] all right
[1:08:09] it had to be within 24 hours so
[1:08:13] no
[1:08:14] right okay
[1:08:17] free more agency
[1:08:20] going to the next one
[1:08:25] God's gifts always find her places 63 12
[1:08:28] 22.
[1:08:32] he had to make him in his image make him
[1:08:35] something like him
[1:08:38] all right now we'll get to that later so
[1:08:39] what was made something like God
[1:08:42] inward part
[1:08:44] all right
[1:08:47] and put him who
[1:08:51] the man
[1:08:53] is being
[1:08:55] on three more agents he didn't let him
[1:08:57] act any way he wanted to
[1:08:59] he could take his choice
[1:09:01] and he knew that man by giving him this
[1:09:03] choice would fall
[1:09:05] so being that he had to do that he turns
[1:09:08] back around and makes the man a partner
[1:09:11] to him
[1:09:14] we'll get to that eventually I hope so
[1:09:16] and does nothing except he does it
[1:09:19] through a man right
[1:09:21] you're listening to somebody preach
[1:09:25] he's turning back around using it right
[1:09:30] are you listening
[1:09:35] look at the next one thy house
[1:09:38] we'll just get this part we'll we won't
[1:09:40] get into the
[1:09:42] creation
[1:09:43] it makes you die house 1961-808
[1:09:46] e66. he come down making man and all the
[1:09:49] animals till he come down to sin
[1:09:51] but he could not make sin
[1:09:53] because he cannot be righteous and the
[1:09:55] father of righteousness to make sin so
[1:09:58] you know what he done
[1:10:00] he made abandoned his own image
[1:10:04] okay
[1:10:05] and knowing that he would fall
[1:10:09] put him on a basis of free moral agency
[1:10:12] now the inside of Adam never fail
[1:10:18] the soul of Adam the eternal life
[1:10:20] couldn't fall
[1:10:23] I know I know people oh you we're just a
[1:10:27] triple part we just Body Spirit and soul
[1:10:29] why does everybody want to divide it
[1:10:32] how many sermons have I preached to you
[1:10:34] in the past even a year
[1:10:35] about do you sin with your body or do
[1:10:38] you sin with your spirit or your sin
[1:10:39] with your soul God if you sin with your
[1:10:41] soul you're lost
[1:10:43] you remember that
[1:10:45] so your body and spirit can still do
[1:10:47] wrong
[1:10:49] okay
[1:10:51] he'd put him on a basis three more ages
[1:10:53] he said now don't touch your street
[1:10:56] he knew he was going to touch it but he
[1:10:59] couldn't
[1:11:00] him to touch it because he said touch
[1:11:03] this tree and you live and touch this
[1:11:05] tree and you die any new man would fail
[1:11:08] but yet he couldn't make him fall
[1:11:11] he had to do it on he had to do it on
[1:11:16] himself
[1:11:17] so what makes God righteous you see
[1:11:21] man fell himself after he made him so
[1:11:25] close to himself
[1:11:27] he put him on the basis of three more
[1:11:29] agency and therefore there is where he
[1:11:32] fell by his own free moral agent act he
[1:11:35] failed
[1:11:37] all right
[1:11:39] free moral agent
[1:11:42] made it to where he'd fall
[1:11:49] let's go one more then we'll just preach
[1:11:51] a second and quit
[1:11:53] one more does God change his mind
[1:11:57] 64 427.
[1:12:00] you're talking about his attributes on a
[1:12:01] display now to be a savior that has to
[1:12:03] be something lost and God cannot
[1:12:04] purposely lose anything and then redeem
[1:12:06] it
[1:12:07] wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and
[1:12:09] his great judgment
[1:12:11] would he put man on three more agency
[1:12:12] knowing that man would fall and in that
[1:12:15] then he became man himself in order to
[1:12:18] redeem Batman that fell
[1:12:21] that's the reason that Jesus was
[1:12:23] Emmanuel if God sent down another person
[1:12:25] besides himself then that wouldn't be
[1:12:27] just God had to come himself and take
[1:12:30] and take place and God could not be come
[1:12:34] down in spirit and take place he had to
[1:12:36] be made flesh
[1:12:38] In the Flesh of his own creative son
[1:12:41] and he show he showed here in the
[1:12:44] beginning that his perfect will was
[1:12:47] to create Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:12:50] Earth
[1:12:51] but you see he permitted sick to be
[1:12:53] brought in
[1:12:55] perfect will
[1:12:56] it was to be created
[1:12:58] physically
[1:13:00] out of the flesh
[1:13:02] let me close or
[1:13:04] speak just a minute
[1:13:07] make sure you understand me
[1:13:12] as we'll cover winds through the inside
[1:13:13] of Adam could not fall
[1:13:19] because it was in the image of God
[1:13:22] but the outside of Adam this flesh man
[1:13:26] he knew if he put us in flesh
[1:13:29] we'd fall
[1:13:32] don't think just because you're a
[1:13:35] Christian
[1:13:37] that that flesh don't control you
[1:13:41] right
[1:13:43] don't think that spirit inside of you
[1:13:45] don't control you
[1:13:51] we're not trying to talk about something
[1:13:53] like that or sinless perfection
[1:13:57] we're talking about a man in the garden
[1:14:01] that would be created
[1:14:04] and made the perfect way
[1:14:08] could not make him wrong and judge him
[1:14:10] for being wrong
[1:14:12] you made him perfect
[1:14:16] he made that inside part of him
[1:14:19] to be eternal
[1:14:22] but the outside of him was a mortal
[1:14:24] flesh
[1:14:27] Eve that devil went straight to her
[1:14:29] spirit being
[1:14:32] he had to pervert her mind first
[1:14:40] that's the way sin enters the picture it
[1:14:41] has to enter through our mind
[1:14:46] he could not make us wrong
[1:14:49] and judge us for being wrong
[1:14:52] so he had to make us right
[1:14:55] that's what I wanted to get this out of
[1:14:56] the way I thought I'd get into the other
[1:14:57] part but we'll just leave it on that
[1:15:01] he knew if he created us we'd go wrong
[1:15:05] yeah but brother Dale you don't you
[1:15:08] don't understand I thought she was
[1:15:09] talking about this morning how eternal
[1:15:11] that part of God is that's right
[1:15:15] that part of God can't fall
[1:15:20] if you're born again Christian you can't
[1:15:22] sin enough to be lost
[1:15:25] but if you're born again Christian why
[1:15:27] would you want to be lost or why would
[1:15:29] you want to sin
[1:15:35] if you'd like to Prophet explaining he
[1:15:37] said if I go overseas he said
[1:15:40] my wife and I he said
[1:15:43] if I went over and said I told her some
[1:15:46] woman run up to me he said I believe
[1:15:48] she'd forgive me
[1:15:51] right
[1:15:54] but he said how would I do that
[1:15:56] knowing that she was at home
[1:16:01] taking care of the kids and all she's
[1:16:03] done
[1:16:05] God knew we would fall now I'm going to
[1:16:08] make it blunt
[1:16:10] all right
[1:16:12] we blame Adam and Eve
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:18] if they had done what would they done we
[1:16:20] wouldn't be what we do
[1:16:25] oh
[1:16:27] I'll do it this way
[1:16:31] so
[1:16:32] um
[1:16:33] not anybody here by the name so we'll
[1:16:35] use it
[1:16:36] so we made uh
[1:16:38] Jim Jones
[1:16:42] Jim Jones is the first man
[1:16:45] we'll get off of that and listen to what
[1:16:47] I'm talking about
[1:16:48] we're trying to be such a smart alec
[1:16:53] if Jim Jones was the first man he'd fall
[1:16:59] because the first man did fall
[1:17:05] but the first man never fell in his
[1:17:08] inner being
[1:17:13] he fell in his physical being
[1:17:16] so God knew if he put us in a physical
[1:17:18] being
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:23] the physical being would override the
[1:17:25] spiritual being
[1:17:28] now you tell me it don't now I'm going
[1:17:30] to tell you to pray for me
[1:17:33] because you know sometimes I get hungry
[1:17:36] and I want something to eat
[1:17:41] when I need to go read and study
[1:17:45] but you know what I wind up going to get
[1:17:47] something to eat
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:54] you know that a lot of times when I come
[1:17:56] in from work and I need a bath
[1:18:01] instead of praying and studying I'm
[1:18:05] going to take a bath
[1:18:07] maybe not for myself but for everybody
[1:18:09] else around me
[1:18:12] my point
[1:18:15] when God made the flesh man
[1:18:20] he made the ability to go wrong
[1:18:25] he didn't make it wrong
[1:18:27] I've tried to say that over and over 40
[1:18:30] years I've said that
[1:18:32] when he made the flesh
[1:18:35] he made the ability
[1:18:37] as long as he was in Adam there was no
[1:18:40] way Satan could get to her
[1:18:45] but once she was removed from him and
[1:18:48] put it in her own body
[1:18:54] brought about the ability
[1:18:57] because the human body
[1:18:59] is the problem
[1:19:01] now come on I know the scriptures I know
[1:19:03] the prophets all right so don't
[1:19:05] Judy chatter around with me
[1:19:08] the body without your spirit is dead I
[1:19:10] know that
[1:19:12] so I'm dealing with that second realm at
[1:19:14] the same time I'm dealing with outside
[1:19:16] so God when he made man he made him
[1:19:20] see tastes feel smelling here
[1:19:23] that would be dealing with life in their
[1:19:25] doings
[1:19:28] but he also made the inward part of man
[1:19:30] memory reason conscious affections Etc
[1:19:36] so what's our problem today Spirit Realm
[1:19:41] and Flash realm flesh is displaying what
[1:19:43] our spirit does wrong you know things so
[1:19:47] we even her spirit went wrong
[1:19:50] he got to the only place he could not
[1:19:53] walk up to Eve and do the wrong Act
[1:20:00] come on that wouldn't have been wrong
[1:20:05] I believe a girl goes out and the boy
[1:20:07] rapes her that that's not her problem
[1:20:08] she's still a virgin
[1:20:12] I know you don't like my talk but plain
[1:20:14] language you argue with me about it then
[1:20:16] she's raped she's still a virgin
[1:20:21] not still restoring any virginity just
[1:20:23] telling it like it is it wasn't her
[1:20:25] fault
[1:20:26] in the Bible he don't kill her you kill
[1:20:29] him
[1:20:35] but you see we were made then
[1:20:38] just mortal beings
[1:20:43] subject to these
[1:20:45] life
[1:20:48] given a spirit
[1:20:50] that is not eternal
[1:20:52] amen
[1:20:55] thereby Satan could get to Eve
[1:21:02] come on
[1:21:03] but you know what he finally done
[1:21:06] where do you want to say Adam was a type
[1:21:08] in Christ or whatever you want to try to
[1:21:10] make it
[1:21:11] steel Adam done wrong
[1:21:16] because he was Immortal
[1:21:21] Eve was able to do what Satan was not
[1:21:24] able to do he was able to enter the
[1:21:26] spirit realm of Adam
[1:21:28] you know what I mean she was able to
[1:21:30] attempt Adam
[1:21:33] and tell Adam I'm all about it didn't
[1:21:35] she tell him
[1:21:37] didn't she give him the fruit didn't she
[1:21:39] tell him about it
[1:21:41] well
[1:21:45] so now when we get into creating the
[1:21:48] Kingdom in God's image just remember
[1:21:49] that the man in God's image can't fall
[1:21:55] but the man in the image of animal
[1:21:59] he is in a fallen condition
[1:22:03] the best you can do with the old bodies
[1:22:05] that we look at you know
[1:22:07] they're gone they got to be redeemed
[1:22:11] my soul is not redeemed I mean my soul
[1:22:14] is redeemed but my body is not redeemed
[1:22:16] page 49 the future home
[1:22:19] waiting the Redemption of the body
[1:22:25] don't dilly dally around with these old
[1:22:27] flesh they can get you in trouble
[1:22:30] oh that don't bother me
[1:22:33] yeah
[1:22:35] you're right in the middle of all of it
[1:22:38] I told you about it I never did drink in
[1:22:40] my life never did care nothing about it
[1:22:43] I never didn't use vulgar I mean you
[1:22:45] know we were kids we used to but I'm you
[1:22:47] know what I'm talking about I never just
[1:22:48] used a lot of vulgarity
[1:22:53] and you know after becoming a Christian
[1:22:54] you know one day I was around somebody
[1:22:57] that was was drinking nothing
[1:23:00] I wonder what that tastes like
[1:23:03] I thought well what in the world am I
[1:23:05] wondering what it would taste like I
[1:23:06] didn't even want it when it was a center
[1:23:10] well you know I could have kept on what
[1:23:11] did it taste like I wonder what it
[1:23:12] tastes like sort of look good knowing
[1:23:13] you know what I would have done I'd went
[1:23:15] and bought one
[1:23:17] oh no I wouldn't do that
[1:23:19] the only reason you wouldn't do it is
[1:23:21] because you're afraid you get caught
[1:23:22] going into the liquor store
[1:23:25] huh
[1:23:28] be like I was going in one day looking
[1:23:30] for some rock you know some some whiskey
[1:23:32] to make cough syrup because the doctor
[1:23:33] told us that there ain't nothing you can
[1:23:35] do for the kids just get you some whisk
[1:23:36] ain't no whiskey and some rock candy
[1:23:38] when I told her I didn't know that beer
[1:23:40] and wine store didn't sell whiskey
[1:23:44] I go in this beer and wine store I'm
[1:23:45] looking for some whiskey
[1:23:50] we don't sell whiskey
[1:23:52] I wonder what he was going after you
[1:23:55] know because he turned around to go get
[1:23:56] it he said we don't sell whiskey I said
[1:23:58] okay would you mind telling me where I
[1:24:00] can get some
[1:24:01] he said you got to find a hard liquor
[1:24:03] store to buy I didn't know
[1:24:09] and see I never would cussing or nothing
[1:24:12] but then I'll be talking to somebody by
[1:24:13] that time something
[1:24:15] you know you have to keep from saying it
[1:24:18] he said oh well brother Dale I'm not
[1:24:20] messed up like I'm glad you ain't messed
[1:24:22] up like me
[1:24:24] I just tell that you don't
[1:24:27] I'm honest
[1:24:30] so you didn't have to say God forgive me
[1:24:32] for even letting a thought enter my mind
[1:24:35] that wouldn't even enter my mind when I
[1:24:37] was a sinner
[1:24:38] why because brother Reynolds said you
[1:24:40] put on that code of a Christian he said
[1:24:43] the devil will turn every gun he's got
[1:24:45] on you he said because he's going to
[1:24:47] make you prove what you are
[1:24:50] well you know what we're here for
[1:24:52] we're here to prove he's wrong that he
[1:24:54] can't get us
[1:24:55] let's stand let's talk think on it
[1:25:01] these bodies these things that we're
[1:25:03] living in
[1:25:04] they're subject to the Fallen condition
[1:25:09] with the soul within us
[1:25:11] by the new birth is eternal
[1:25:15] don't give us a right to go out and do
[1:25:16] wrong
[1:25:18] no
[1:25:20] it shows when we do wrong we're going to
[1:25:22] automatically repent in a hurry
[1:25:24] why because we
[1:25:27] we're the children of God
[1:25:31] I want to make sure you understand that
[1:25:32] before we start a condition because why
[1:25:35] would you need Redemption if you didn't
[1:25:37] have a fallen condition and what was the
[1:25:40] Fallen condition
[1:25:42] not God making us wrong
[1:25:46] he made us perfect
[1:25:49] but Satan knew how to pervert what he
[1:25:51] made
[1:25:52] and to be able to contact us
[1:25:55] that way I don't blame Adam and Eve
[1:25:57] right do you what do we got
[1:26:02] number 87 anybody have a need
[1:26:05] just think on it
[1:26:07] God knew we'd go wrong
[1:26:22] understanding
[1:26:31] every day with
[1:26:35] blood as I walk with the heaven
[1:26:39] leader let me go on the white with a
[1:26:44] shot
[1:26:46] feel my way anybody have a knee
[1:26:50] just think about it
[1:26:53] he knew it'd fall
[1:26:55] but he knew what he's gonna do
[1:27:01] he would go to college staff
[1:27:05] the Salvation not made on anything but
[1:27:08] an eternal God
[1:27:13] he knew what he was going to do
[1:27:20] he don't thank us for going wrong no God
[1:27:25] he didn't make us wrong
[1:27:29] but by Falling we could God could bring
[1:27:32] forth his attributes
[1:27:40] if we realize
[1:27:43] there is a God to take care of all
[1:27:45] things
[1:27:47] see as the king all the way
[1:27:53] every day
[1:27:58] every day
[1:28:15] with love
[1:28:20] think about him
[1:28:25] he didn't go somewhere else and wait on
[1:28:28] us he come down
[1:28:32] he's gonna make sure everything goes
[1:28:34] right
[1:28:41] gonna make sure
[1:28:42] that everything goes the way he wants it
[1:28:46] Lord
[1:29:05] praise the Lord
[1:29:11] praise the Lord right
[1:29:15] praise the Lord
[1:29:18] let all God's people praise the Lord
[1:29:24] shake them off
[1:29:27] Heavy band
[1:29:34] praise the Lord
[1:29:39] called wine because we're
[1:29:41] just his offspring right
[1:29:44] so let's end it up with ain't God good
[1:29:46] brother that'll it'll go right
[1:29:55] good
[1:29:57] give us
[1:30:02] what we are
[1:30:06] yeah we have to thank him
[1:30:10] a little more today
[1:30:19] ain't God good you believe it
[1:30:26] to redeem us
[1:30:29] to make a way
[1:30:34] give us a choice

[1:30:40] wrong choice three more agencies when
