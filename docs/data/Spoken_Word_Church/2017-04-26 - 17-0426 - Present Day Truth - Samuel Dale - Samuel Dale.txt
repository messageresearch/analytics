1st Corinthians 11 then we're going to second Corinthians 13 first Corinthians 11 the second Corinthians 13 and thank everybody again for the time that we had we had a real good time Saturday there at the festival and it was great the food was wonderful and you know in doing and and we had a good time fellowship in together and had a excellent opportunity for weather-wise everything was just perfect with it we didn't have to worry about nothing it was all great and we really enjoyed it and enjoyed brother Chris long being with us our ministering Sunday I really enjoyed him and just appreciate the brothers that have always done told you I believe that there's others around the world that you know that are trying their best and striving for on things that I have hammered at it and hollered about it for 40 years you know and I'm glad to be able to make contact with anybody that I can see a desire in their heart for them to try to get the word to the people and get us all into good shape and all and get ready for the rapture for somebody to just talk about it in thrills my soul because that's always my desire and now this time I'm just playing I say it like this you say what do you agree with everything you hear no I don't agree with everything I hear I don't even even agree with everything I believe is that strong enough or is that plain enough to dis be honest and this straight you know I've always had an opportunity to change what I believe you know if somebody just showed me the truth you know that's the main thing to me but I I really appreciate the brother poured out his heart pray for him he's travelling around kind of in the area before going back alright remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday and May over at brother pageants the 3:30 so we'll be living here in a neighborhood of one we don't have to be too early we won't stop and eat we may stop and get a little snack on the way but make sure if you're going you know and to invest with the van make sure you eat before you you're ready to go God won't be like we're having to do for all the others nanny took her test our Monday she will not know about it until she goes back to the doctor so just pray and believe and we think everything is going to be alright I talked to Danny a moment there I go about his testing things and and we just gonna believe everything's gonna be all right those we're not going to accept anything else cause like I told him the way this system is setup and the doctors and all now 98% of the people go into a heart doctor's office they got heart trouble 90% goes into order you call the orthopedic surgeon they got something needs to be operated on right and you know you never get I I appreciate the doctor telling me like Tony said whatever you're doing just keep doing it but you know he still wants his little hand in it he gets paid for telling me that that's just less that's what I mean if you you go to the kidney doctor 90 percent of people are gonna have kidney problems no that's just the way the whole world set it up you know but we do appreciate all the things that they do and just keep praying for somebody to be like Danny and come through all of the things he's come through he's got a legal bona fide right to be sitting down somewhere in a wheelchair and letting somebody be taking care of him you know and rolling him around but he doesn't do that so that's the kind of my guy I like that I don't like somebody that just gives up and you know and just quit I like to see somebody that fights okay any other announcements missing brother Prakash will be with us the Lord willing on the I believe it's the fourth of November but it's the first Sunday in November I mean nope June June I just got to keep my months it's just somewhere this year he'll be here don't worry about but it is pray for me be traveling about you know ok first great anything else first Corinthians 11 and then we'll go to 2nd Corinthians and just try to get a little thought tonight and just move on in to what we've been talking about we're trying to do it it was just one I call them one-shot messages and all like that and that's not derogatory to anyone else a lot of people do that but I'm not based that way it'll strike and I'm like the old dog on a rabbit trail once I get on it I'll just keep running but I have to find a rabbit trail so we do that ok father we thank you for all of your love and your grace and to us thank you for everything father that you've given unto us and we know and realize that without you there would be nothing within any of us of mankind or anything any work they would be worth anything but yet you've taken our people that was worth nothing and you make a people out of them for your honor and your glory and we love you and we thank you bless each one remember the sick ones among us to the different things the requests that were given in tonight because we believe in we thank you and just have your way with us forgive our sins cleanse us Lord and cleanse our thoughts or ideas or all it would be anything contrary to You Lord just have your weight in Jesus name Amen 1st Corinthians 11 very familiar but I love this scripture not just because it is the communion Scripture but I love it because it's a wonderful thoughts and great ways to understand verse 26 see we come down through the cup into different things and says for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord now this is the point but let a man examine himself now it doesn't say in the Bible for us to examine everybody else right there's no scripture to examine everybody else it's always to examine ourselves all right now but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily see and examine ourselves right right he does then drink of damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body all right we know what happens beyond that and the thoughts but let's go to the 13th 2nd Corinthians 13 to just pick up the thought for tonight and it says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves now we'll get to that in a minute no you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates but I trust that you should shall know that ye we are not reprobates you may be seated the Lord that is blessing through the reading of the word now it says examine ourselves so we read in Corinthians you know we are to do that and before we take communion we always stop and give an opportunity maybe not verbally say if anybody's got anything to say or whatever you know but we give an opportunity to give a few moments of silent prayer to you know pray and to do and to try to get ourselves into the right order all right now I'm studying on a thought and I know it's gonna take a lot of dealing with it but I've been studying for months just letting the mind run this is thinking you know don't even have not one note just kind of pondering a thought of what is it really like to be a Christian you know is it a person who walks perfect you would only find one that be the Lord Jesus Christ didn't we turn around and condemn him because he took a wilt and run some people out of the temple one day and you see where my thoughts is running what is it really to be a Christian what is your thoughts about just being a Christian we know for certain - one thing that is not being perfect because we can't do that so that solves that problem you see where I'm where I'd be headed into the thout and it's just it's building up in one of these days I'll get on a other thing and take off with it I guess but now think about it Paul says when you come to the table of the communion he doesn't say to do this or do that he simply says examine yourself not to examine anything else not to examine you know this part or that part or try to examine anybody else or look at somebody else and say well they're not worthy I have a situation when done happened and I asked some people about it and and one brother said I won't set in the congregation with that type of a person I guess that's your thoughts but I said you sure not gonna set around here because it's not going the way you say it it's going away the Lord tells me to go it's not gonna be what you say now to examine yourself well what what do you do when it comes to the communion part I want this in every culture of the thoughts running with the message of a true Christian but what do you do when it comes to the community you know time of the communion and like I said we take a moment and this have a silent prayer now I wrote a random we can give the quotes of what to do and what does he say he says you pay pray for your pastor he said he prays for you a lot now if you don't pray for me during that time you know that's your end of the deal because I do pray for you now I don't pray 1 2 3 4 5 you know I pray a one lump sum Lord you know Lord come and make us all worthy to take this communion all right see that I'm not saying that you know for this Saturday I'm just saying we say well the Prophet said for us to do it that way all right so we we examine ourselves and how do we examine ourselves now watch the reference as we move over to the next message because it gets into proving your sale all right and then we'll pick it up a little higher on examine yourself you know I mean we don't have to sit down in and really what we do a lot of times is we we try to make oh I don't know what you would call it oh we make a situation that we let back into the hands of the Lord that's okay go we say Lord if I've done anything you know you forgive me is that a repentance or an examining of ourselves you know and we do when we come to the communion like I said we say Lord make me worthy admitting that I am not worthy or why would I ask for him to make me worthy right good it's not like sister was telling us other day that I went to this church and you've heard me tell it before somebody else did to that you know there's a group of people and they take the communion well they passed the plate they passed the bread among the congregation but nobody takes it well then they pass the wine among the people but nobody takes it because they're not worthy but there is selected special people of high ranks or whatever you would call them leadership etc they can take the communion well I think that's kind of a yeah well like a words that's a dirty way of doing things no because you're showing that nobody Dyer is worthy no well if we admitted it that's true but it's not God determining who's worthy it's mankind in that situation determining who's worthy I wonder what they would do if I walked in and sit down and they passed the communion and I I would probably get tossed out you know that would you know because they're serious about it and that we could go in to name in those type of groups but you know a lot of them things is heavenly group in earthly groups and all this that any other but yeah the point is when you're standing there to take the communion we're having to depend upon him anyway so we all admit that we're not worthy but we're not trying to pick out one among us that would be worthy and put them up and let them take it and rest ever sit there and look at him no we ask God to cleanse us to forgive us I think that should be our prior before we come to the communion table if she just simply asked the Lord to make us worthy well you know what he does it in a simple matter of the fact that he's already done it and he makes us worthy to do it and see what you're doing you're not examining him and in the communion you're not examining the situation we'll get to just a minute you're not examining necessarily whether you're believing the word your you're dealing with examining yourself as to you know ourselves as to where we are guilty and we need to be forgiving not that's why I read the Corinthians because see that way it goes on to say you know some take it you know and some are asleep because they take it because they won't examine themselves and see then they won't say well Lord you know I'm sorry I'm guilty would you forgive me that's the easiest way to take communion you don't have to make it a long lengthy prior you know how to go through all of the things and brother mote used to have a good way of saying it he said if you stole the man's horse you need to take the horse back but now what if you get it to the communion table and it would be good I am I'm not I'm I'm fine brother branham to say you know lay it down and go make it right okay but if you're honest and sincere in your heart and you intend to take the horse back the next day what would be wrong with taking the communion because you've made it right with the Lord that's my point not trying to deal with him to compromise or or anything just saying Lord now you know I'll do it so forgive me so he makes you worthy all right now you get that side of the situation out of the way well see then we go over into the second Corinthians and it says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith right now if we went down to the baptist today and we said well now what is the faith they give you a definition or a run-through of understanding of what the Baptist faith is and and you would say well well right now who do I need to examine myself by you know and they say well you need to examine yourself by the badge of faith you know you know they doubt their point well you go to the Methodists they would say well the badness ain't right let's imagine it's a right so we're examining ourselves according to the method it's dr. Pentecostal doctrine or whatever we are yeah but what about examining ourselves to see whether we be in the faith according to the Bible in Ephesians 4 and verse 5 the Bible says there's one Lord one faith one baptism what now he said yep yep it says many rewards in these many faiths and there's many baptism no there's none now Paul in his effort in his point to the people in Ephesus he knew that there's water baptism and this Holy Ghost baptism so what do you go you go to the total apex of the whole event and you're talking about dire one Lord that's all there is one faith one revelation and one baptism veteran said Holy Ghost baptism now looks like he'd be did and he said well now you got the baptisms written you got the baptisms let's see Paul's not saying it thataway Paul is saying put it to the apex put it to the top put it as far as it can go there's just one Lord yet we can read it in the Bible but the Lord said unto my lord that's in the scripture but that doesn't make two Lords right humanly speaking you can look at the word Lords and define that that's not what Paul's saying Laura saying I don't care what you think about all these Lords and all these things there's just one Lord right all right he says now I'm not talking about it because we all know and understand that we have water baptism and we have Holy Ghost baptism but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about Paul would say the top apex of it all is to call it the Holy Ghost baptism and then that would cover your water baptism because you ain't gonna get the Holy Ghost unless your baptism is correct right if you know now come on they we're human if you know you know the truth and won't follow it your God not gonna give you the Holy Ghost all right now then if that be true of one Lord and be true of one baptism well now how many face are they well you ask the Baptist and they've got their faith you guys the Methodist they got your faith you ask the Pentecostals they've got their faith which means their revelation of what they are you ask the people of this message and what do they go to you ask the two Lords and they've got their faith come on people in the message you got these doctrines all right you you go to you know any doctrine to sold anything to Lords you go to any kind of a doctrine and they call that their faith well now what would be the faith that would cover the whole form of faith as you would be covering the whole form of one Lord yet speaking of Lords and as you would take it to the baptism and we know this Holy Ghost baptism there's many feelings of the Holy Spirit many baptisms that away there's a water baptism uh-huh but yet we finalize it by coming back to the Holy Spirit baptism well we got to do that with the word faith or either we were not following her same line of thought right to examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith then there was a time down through time that Martin Luther he started out with the right point of the just shall live by faith and that was his faith right turned the world upside down through that faith now what hmm what's the wording what what point could we put as an apex as we would talk about the as we did about the Lord's you know as we did about the baptism what would be the apex are talking about your faith you realize then that we must believe what Martin Luther taught because it was the truth not everything he told right because he was a Trinitarian he was still hooked up with that but there was just one faith now if your faith will not compare with the faith of Martin Luther no I need to keep going over and over it we're understand we're human Martin Luther had a lot of things a lot of problems a lot of teachings he taught her Trinity he probably taught eternal hills and and everything he baptized wrong he had all kind of things but yet God talked so much other what are you doing until he put that anchor there of the just shall live by faith you realize then if our faith would be any different today Ramar ting Luther's faith we're making more than one faith John Wesley stood on what Martin Luther taught and brought the message for his day which would have been the faith of that day a sanctification you see why then that we as Christians and why brother Branham would emphasize it so much he realized that we're still anchored to that justification it's not the with you oh we don't need that anymore we're beyond that now where are you beyond it how are you gonna keep it one faith one Lord one baptism you got to find a position that will fit all things and see there's where this message comes in there goes it gives us the answer did brother Branham do not dilute there's message no he made it a foundation just as the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul comes over in his writings and he talks about the wild olive tree the time holly tree the different things right and he says now listen we were we would say we don't want nothing to do with him o Jews all says now you better hold it he said because they are the roots and if you glory in anything you glory in the roots yeah but look at all they done look what all loser done look what all Westray done look what all the Pentecostals done but it was God's move of the hour right see Paul in his a defining Israel he was saying they are the roots you realize then we're grafted in to them without them there is no hope of Christianity oh we just we just by faith where's your revelation mo said there's just one thing but as I said you go anywhere and try to find out and everybody says you got to come to our church in our thoughts and our doctrine because we've got the faith well you know if that's true we better go right so now what are we going to define faith indulge well we're to examine ourselves and improve ourselves it's just as much in the proven as there is in examining are you with me Paul's reading we'll get to it as I said then Paul says don't you boast in that you are something said if you're going to boast boast in them roots back there yeah but they killed Jesus I'm not see those for you you're not following it are you gonna take out Paul's writings about that are you gonna dismiss that and rip it out of your Bible it Paul is saying our roots are Jewish no but brothers that we're the bride we're going to be a bride without their Jewish roots see one faith one revelation we said well that's a revelation of Jesus Christ amen in the revelation of Jesus Christ his ribs on the roots and we're grafted into it and remember what Paul says to show he's right he says you both did initially both that we said you just remember one thing there's coming a day then he's going to turn back to them and then you'll really realize the true faith of Abraham you'll find in the true faith but what I was looking at Abraham about because remember that's the roots he's a bit protective Oh fuse I'm gonna it's not all them all Jews is its the ones who had the faith right don't you want to be anchored to Abraham without that there's no hope but remember Jesus Christ comes when the seed of Abraham what by faith by revelation huh but then what are you getting at I'm getting to the one point of one thing how would we examine ourselves today as I said we've got all kind of doctrines around the message and you know that every one of them says they have the faith right and they say you got to come to their thoughts and their ideas because they are the ones it's got the faith what you know if that's true we need to tack up duds and leave I guess don't we I mean if it's true but why is it you don't believe all of those doctrines and ideas who is me and you the right to think about who's writing is wrong because it's mortal human beings wherever one wrong dunno how are we going to examine ourselves I get tickled about it and I'm not throwing off on it now but I you know I didn't come up to Pentecost but I come up with a lot of you that was come through Pentecost and and and I said listen that's he talked you know or did and you know in a they say well it's tried other spirit you know but what's the biggest definition of most people trying somebody spirit oh look I'm writing I'll try your spirit by looking you in a you just blanked I got you spirit see know how do you try spirit right how do you try spirit to see where that's right spirit or not well if it's good if it's loving if it's kind if it's wonderful no you got to try it by the word right are you with me you try spirit by the word huh but now by whose word I always did back there I mean I'm honest back in the bad person time I had a lot of thoughts that a lot of people didn't like talk about because my thoughts words for how they could be one Bible and so many different beliefs you know I didn't have to come in this message to find that out I found it out back guard you know that there was a lot of different beliefs and how could you do it with one Bible no no what you see what about examining yourselves let's read the rest of that scripture to examine yourselves see whether you be in the faith and he didn't just leave it dire he says prove your own selves no you're not your own selves now that Jesus Christ is in you except you'd be reprobate now how do you know Jesus Christ is in you what is the evidence to be able to anchor to word that we don't have any problems what was the evidence the Prophet had when he said the Holy Spirit had to straighten him out on his point of the even the evidence of the Holy Ghost right and he came down to the evidence of the Holy Ghost as to being whether or not your spirit would agree with the word see now then we have something to talk about because if we examine ourselves the correct way well see by that examining ourselves we're going to prove ourselves is that what he said and by proving ourselves we're gonna know that there's only one way to be in anything and that's Jesus Christ being in us or else we're going to be reprobates we're gonna be outcast we're gonna be then goes in there's only one way to try ourselves okay not trying one another but try ourselves [Music] now let's put it this way then Martin Luther had the truth we believe that see whether you realize it or not you you're an examining yourself that's what I'm getting at do you're examining yourselves to see whether or not you agree with Martin Luther will you take all of the bad parts and I don't think we won't agree with it in here so then what do we do we prove ourselves he says one brother branham would always that always would get me until say like the future home I remember first time reading that and thinking of what he said about 15 16 explains but he's going to tell you about a future home right and what does he say he said we want to get this part here right about the new birth and then he said something to the degree of it doesn't do us much good to know about a future home if we can't look at what we have now we can't examine ourselves by the Bible terminologies of how that it would be that the future home would come how that it would be that the world had to be justified the world had to be sanctified justified in the days of Noah through the washing sanctified through the blood of Jesus Christ dropping upon and said one day it's going to receive a fiery baptism and he said our new birth is the same way so now see we're examining ourselves to see if what we believe will compare with all of those messengers through the ages right and we believe in Luther's justification we believe in Wesley's sanctification we believe in the baptism of the holy spirit they can move the day on the Zeus's Street see that way we're we're examining ourselves to see if our doctrine is that have you ever heard of message we're bread around them I'm the truthful you know one of me there's probably haven't never read a message yet they brought around didn't explain justification sanctification the baptism logos right I mean the truth you might be able to find one you know what I'm getting that the majority of every message he's basing it on justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Spirit he's proving the token by justification sanctification baptism he's proving Christ mister of God revealed by justification sanctification empty is one hold ago what do you do when he got into the seals he says now listen he said none especially I'm overcome in the back of the seventh seal he said now especially when this comes up tonight the way we're looking at he said just remember you got to go on with the same simple message what is the same simple message justification sanctification the baptism of the holy God that's the same simple message the that message fits every age and every thought now listen in the days of Martin Luther that message of the just shall live by faith you know if you didn't believe it the way Martin Luther taught it even in the age that true your salvation was not dark because he was the one that brought the way right all right now if we can't bring that over here now the title of the message is examine yourselves but there's a subtitle placed opponent that you know it's like this whether you're in the present truth or not you realized then why it says in in Hebrews 11 40 he speaks of Old Testament New Testament speaks of the whole thing they say without us cannot be made perfect that means somebody some work is coming to a present tense gospel and it'll be just like it was in the days of Martin Luther no no no see that's where you're not getting the simplicity of the gospel is it true that they was a bride in the days of Martin Luther is it true there were people that were born again or are you gonna say oh no there wasn't oh no them listen I've told you I've heard people say it you know pick people that claim they couldn't preach ever stand and say them Pentecostals was false me sitting there crying in my hearts and Lord keep me from getting up don't let me get up and say anything go that brother he's honest and sincere and that's his way of seeing things he said well what about a present-day truth you realize every age yeah my point ever age had a present-day truth and Mirat no matter what age is seeing it was a present-day truth something was present at that time which was God himself see God is the only one that could justify the lutheran sanctify the methodist no quoting brother branham baptized the Pentecostal and said in order the coming of the Lord only the holy ghost can do it though they were right back where we started that is one faith one Lord one baptism if we don't have the same Melissa if you Luther didn't have the same baptism when the Holy Ghost you got then he's got something different what you got there run now let me say it this way and let it just be plain blood if that Holy Spirit that we have is not the same as Luther had then we don't have God's Holy Spirit we're not in the person they truth cuz the other way you don't reject Luther right come on I keep saying it over and over cousin oh this goes out and I know it goes out in your mind too Luther had a lot of problems the God didn't look at his problems he looked at his revelation of a present-day truth and came on the scene and saved the world John Wesley moved a little higher but he anchored what he had and like I say in the other day he was anchored in John in Martin Luther's message then he seen that God was opening doors the Pentecostals all we think about his gifts and it's out of the other that's why I hammer it so hard and brother Ron said there was no messenger to Zeus the street he said cause the Holy Ghost came himself he said in the fullness of the baptism and called it another great prophet then ain't brother Branham the heat comes the end of the age mm-hmm but how are we gonna try anything what is our standard or what we do first message I preached in this church was going beyond man's camp and all I said was this one thing I said forgive us for pulling apart and moving on because this was July 2 4 1971 I said because your cabbage anon it and you're doing the same thing the Prophet said so we're just gonna move on cuz we're going on beyond man's camp we see we've got to go beyond man's count to go be where God is right no problems with anybody but trying to move on in God and trying to stay with a present-day truth trying to stay with the truth that will tie to ever church age he never born again believer goes that I just quoted the probably said to only goes to justify the neutered the same old ago sanctified the messages same Holy Ghost the old the Pentecostals CS whatever horse just gifts and dice you better go study a lot I've tried to say it lately to get you to think about it later Branham was not the first one that come forth baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they were already doing that before he came on the scene now listen and then you you argue with me of us whatever young to that's your business those oneness people that come to that doctrine of the oneness was the present-day truth at that time you know and were closer to the truth than the ones baptizing in the Father Son and Holy Ghost did a name had to be restored see there was a day when the Baptist was God's present day truth there was a day when the Methodist was God's present day truth there was a day when the Pentecostals was God's present day truth there was a day when believing that God sent a prophet who is the present-day truth which there comes a day that we must move on not leaving the prophet if you think that is you didn't bad shape the way that I teach it and we're bringing it because I read everything with a present-day truth I'll get to it the Lord within and Sunday you know where the way brother Branham would talk he said revivals are over no more world wide sweeping revivals the delights big revival was Azusa Street we didn't need stop and he'd say but this revival that we've been inside all of them life stood not three and a half years when he said this revival we've been in has been going on for 15 years I said it's dying down he said people looking for a great we're alive flippin revival he said that's the Israel after we're gone but didn't he stops and he says but the bride hasn't had a revival yet now what's he doing he's telling you the truth he was in the present they truths right the president they truth would they're not gonna be more no more world wife's we've been reliable but he said the bride hasn't had a revival yet all right were we at then are you expecting a revival I'm quoting from the man you claim to have the present-day truth but do you believe what he's saying present-day truth let's just read something know what he says about this examining ourselves go ahead were number one brothers let's read a little bit questions and answers on the seals if you look back down examine yourself with the word and see whether your see where you're at well brother Dale we just floating along now we just kind of got into a slump and we just floating along where's there present-day truth to that I admit that's where most people are at well that still there's no problem that's I'm looking for a present they true and you women you got short hire let her grow if you're wearing shorts take them off act like a lady if you men are still smoking cigarettes and run to pool hall stop it I don't care how much you profess if you're still holding that organization and saying this is it and this is it you better stop look down and examine it with a word now like this one we're getting plumb out of we ought to live above the short hair and all this aids now we're back into something that God's revealing the hidden mysteries that's been put on the book before the foundation of the world what's he saying you realize there was a day when you were hearing about you close your dress you're higher in men those things of our lives you know our doings you know that was a present-day truth but then he said we need to move on or something move into what the revealing of the hidden mysteries Justin put on the book before the foundation of the world those who have obeyed in these small things will catch it in these other things if they haven't it'll go over the top of your head as far as the East is from the West because you're not recognizing the president they truth that's simply what I'm talking about but showing what he would say as we asked to start with how do you check spirits how do you check things how do you know of a present-day true you check it by the word right but just remember now what if what you're checking it with is not the present they truth well horses decide God in his word a present-day truth look at this one now for leadership go to number two you're talking about coming down to being a real Christian instead of that being impersonator sometimes you know not just examine yourself by the word by the message you see work church we're different from all the other people in this basis we at least claim to have had a prophet and if we need if we have a question we go to the Prophet to the Baptist Methodist not like that you know they got to go to the higher-ups in their groups or the fella that knows more this one does that or some Pentecost will come up with a prophet over here or this that or the other and checking it out the if we're checking it by the word and the word is the message you see why that when you ask me about something I say I'll show you what read around and said it I was well taught that from the beginning most of you know brother mo appreciate God putting us into that position to where he would anchor me into that place because if brother mote said brother Brown believed in one God he read it to you huh anybody remember that we used to ride the country and I'd memorized all of the books by color and brother mo had on every one of them in the back of his car sitting in boxes in volumes mine is still into this at home all of us in volumes and he'd say future home I didn't scramble and look I just reached in and got a blue book cause that was blue then and I just gave it to him if he said let's see what he's got of this evil a doubly on green either that or which one was it and you know I could just pull them up by colors because I'd read so much we'll see what he was he doing he was showing that brother branham said it not quoting it like I say a preacher gets up in the pulpit I'm not against anybody that you don't have to read quotes and everything hell you just preach if it's true God to him the words right or not but I do like to know where you got it from especially if it's something a little bit controversial line you know I do like to know work come from but I got anchored in that to work that but it's examined yourself by the word and he says by the message then why would he say by the word and then by the message no it's just what I'm describing to you we have a message but thank God is not just saying one guy come out and he'd say Martin Luther said so himself I heard him the other one come up and say no he didn't he said so and so cuz I heard then you had arguments with each other right let's see now you can say brother Ron said showing so he said well show me worse headed see we were instantly on a computer we could pull up those things at least to find the answers what about a present-day truth you understand what I'm getting in you realize the church the benefits and the opportunity that we have in this day to be able to ask a question and get an immediate answer well you just got the one you own it well okay bring the yours and let's see if they fit and the problem a present-day truth let's watch this one go to number four well I'm against organized religion now the church is predestinated to meet God without spot or wrinkle now if we are in that church we are predestinated with that church now examine yourself by the word then you can check up how far alone we are how far along are we I don't know we're just in a message we just believe how far along are we what are you expecting 50 years ago he said rather than what are you expecting I'm expecting an outpouring of the Holy Spirit to fill every fiber of my being and take me in the rapture because that's what the prophecy I'm expecting a great revival among the bride of Jesus Christ the God will do in 1 year or what theologists try to do in 2000 because the Prophet said it what are you expecting I don't know I just can't figure it out cuz I thought we'd be out of here in 73 and a half or 73 or 73 and a high 75 77 I sure was gonna be gone what 77 I know we couldn't make 2,000 and many people sit back there books and things 77 didn't take place but what about it he said if we examine ourselves by the word then we can check up how far along we are their words know right where we're at is that it that did that change what he said in you we'd know right where we're at by checking ourselves with the word do you really believe that just you live my faith as Martin Luther told it I said the truth now ain't there talking about all the ideas and opinions and ideas that mankind placed upon all of these things I'm saying there was a present-day truth and without you believe in that present-day truth you would miss it repeat we went through the church ages trying to describe just recently how the messenger comes in the age and what would happen and how did it fail and how that the messenger would always come at the end of the age not at the beginning it started it was start from there and all in explaining that Pentecost had failed the Orthodox Church and then he brought his message to a Gentile dispensation and seeing that in this last days it would be a very special day for the lysed because that holy ghost that would that came on a Zeus's street it's your prophet called it the holy ghost the prophet they call it the fullness of the baptism do you believe that because if you don't you're not in the present-day true because you you gotta go back and get that straight brother said one time to me he said what do you think about these people of the message brother Dale what are you talking about he's telling nobody didn't have the Holy Ghost like the book of Acts he said what do you think about the people this message I said I'll tell you the God's honest truth biggest portion of know how the baptismal oligos well here was my definition cuz it wouldn't be that much jumbled up mass right he's any problem with that with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we got problems but he's not gonna leave us in problems so we're to examine ourselves what a number five recognising your day in this message no nope just to the lice you can read the whole message part and look if you're hot-headed here you beyond hit it there if you're a doubter here you'd be a doubter there men and women it's time to shake yourselves and to examine yourself and see where we are standing or death does not change it if we're down here we'd be a doubter liar but if we're in the present-day truth now and we examine ourselves and prove ourselves didn't will be no doubters that right come on he's over brother Bramblett said you'd be a doubter doc now you know yourself what he's saying now this don't play with me and I don't play with you because that's all right you know we got a message but we know what the messenger was in his thoughts you know he wasn't saying they wouldn't we get to heaven there's gonna be all kind of doubt or sitting around now you know better damn so forget it he's making a statement or a thought or a concept to us that whatever we are here we're going to be that dire because death don't change other than our dwelling place present-day truth listen what he says here on number six letting off the pressure he says examine yourself take inventory see have I bypassed his word I know the Bible says that but I don't believe it that way be careful you're not dead yet if the Holy Spirit was in there he'd say Amen no now come on if you got the Holy Ghost in you and I read you something run around says and you can't Amen that then you don't have the Holy Spirit within you because remember the Holy Spirit's always been in the present day truth no matter what age but what's going on listen but I believe the days of miracles are pipes you do in the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe that the signs of March 16 or for another generation you do when he said these signs shall follow them that believe how far to the end of the world no I'm with you always and the works that I do shows you do also how long to the end of the world all the promises of the prophets that's in this evening time the Prophet said there be a day it wouldn't be called day or night it'd be dismal you know he's talking about East and West and civilization we're on the west coast not physically the gospel wives is one across the United States and he ended it up right the next would go back over and it would fall back to Israel right alright so then there's got to be some water we don't have to have any problems in ideas that's where the trouble is you see we've we know enough of the message to be very destructive with it yes but he also said that was about a 1967-68 quote right that you could say anything and they'd come back but he also said in other words making a contradictory and trying to show how smart we are trying to show how dumb the Prophet was that he couldn't keep it straight but he also said do you know what he was doing with that definition right he wasn't making it that the Bible says this but it also says he wasn't making it some contradictory Oh something wrong here right here or whatever he was telling the truth God said so and so but he also said if you took a certain line in the scriptures with a concordance you can prove that the oneness idea our concept is true what if you take your own concept or thought from it you can prove the Trinity is right to your own thinking we see we're not supposed to take our thinking why that's the profit what the answer is if you don't want the answer you're asking him to say what you want him to say right and then when somebody says but he also said present day truth exam when ourselves to see right where we're at where are we brother that we're on early we're right on time we're right on time what is that song and God may be four days late but he's always on time you realize you and I have the opportunity of studying the Bible as no one has ever had we don't have to say what is your input you know what is your thoughts but you see we're so smart ethically because when you say something the mind says but you also say it well all right are you making it contradictory oh no no I'm not doing that I'm just saying just saying what brother Branham said he said he also say it now according to my understanding he said the concept of the trinitarianism was wrong according to my understanding of what he said he said the oneness concept of God was wrong now that's not it he said but he also said that's he's showing you both of them drunk and he says in between dire he said I pulled in the vision or whatever a limb off the oneness and the limb off the Trinity and stuck it down into a tree or whatever you know and it grows into a gray tree what not - this hi friend he right he did not leave running out over here we're oneness and then was running out of yeah where Trinity he's showing you that by the Holy Spirit within him God gave him the truth both of them had truth but they didn't have the truth examine yourself what are you expecting Billy Graham made a statement one time outstanding that's probably I before even heard the message I guess but he said something like this paraphrasing it maybe but he said in the morning I'll get up looking for him and say if you don't come in the mornings that I'll be looking the next morning paraphrasing it I guess I missed it a little bit but his thought was what he was looking for the Lord according to the Bible he'll only come for those who are looking for him right so let's examine ourselves with the Bible and for heaven's sake we don't want to be like the one brother branham's listen to another day there that guy you know and I won't call his name cousin Anita but he said that Bible's been changed so many times and ain't even nothing just for good reading nothing to live by that's his concept you know what he has a great following around the world probably out of that concept that to him is a present-day truth what is your present they truth what are you expecting well really I don't know what to expect according to the Bible when I talk about visions like the according to the Bible it says without a vision they will perish as this message brought a vision to you that's not talking about seeing visions and a lot of people to say well I've never seen a vision so God would be disrespectful t-that's that's not what he's talking about right what is your vision or what is your thoughts about this day you see the reason I like to quote right around him is just the one else quoting wanna go he says God can do in one year what theology astir whatever you call that word in there is done in 2000 they didn't stop that's where we quote that was quote that one decided he said what he's doing it now he realized the person who walks out with this earth will really know what justification truly is and that's the way Luther called it oh not the doctrine the ideas or the end outs or what did this doesn't ever mm-hmm no he taught to just deliver faith you realize the one who walks out of this earth will be one who is following of the best that can do as human beings John Wesley's teaching of sanctification but I can show you in his own writings you know what he calls sanctification you ever notice brother Brown said he didn't say it about Luther but he said about Wesley he said Wesley at the new birth of sanctification you realize what Martin Luther tell me what John Wesley taught I'll be glad to bring you the book he taught that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit Martin Luther talk to him you know what John Wesley then must have taught that justification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit he was right Zeus the street with the baptism with the Holy Ghost oh it's just gifts you're you're you're not reading or listening what is the present-day truth how you said see what are you in the word or not prove yourself I thought the Bible spoke of proving ourselves not just in that scripture all when he would come out there and bring that message and stand there and declare the truth we only look at it as God doing this for that or the other as proof in signs but you know Paul couldn't do that because he told us the tech can't be running right away he tied everything he had why do you think he spent three and a half years the backside of the desert now listen then while quoting brother branham why did he go to backside to dead now listen why did he go to Peter James and John he went with him he went home he was with him it was right in these they were okay but he left there and went right by yourself with what not a book P eroding but with the Old Testament Scrolls Marah three and a half years a man studying the Old Testament Scrolls one time he used that after fourteen years so you can live flop but it's three and a half or whatever up taking the Old Testament Scrolls to see if what happened to him was right all right he was proving his experience come on we're supposed to be in today that we believe the prophet in billing the prophet then we must believe that Paul was teaching anointed ones just like easties anointed ones and Paul said there's got to come a falling away now let's get a present-day truth just for a minute Paul said there must be a falling away oh no I just take this over here where he said the Lord Himself said forever yeah boys for an archangel trumpet Agard no he said there's got to be a falling away come before that can take place you can't fall unless you're out place to fall look what happened when the Prophet left the scene oh they wouldn't our say the things they say today while he was here huh oh no after he left the scene he started a falling away well because we had reached a position where we could fall from because we had the message all said examine yourself to see if you've fallen away examine yourself listen to see whether your reprobates I see today it doesn't make no difference the people of the message they just accept everything coming and going you see why did it thrills my soul to hear a man preach some things I know it's true you see that's what I'm listening for and searching for we may differ in her ideas and approach in wordings and thoughts and ideas because that's the human element that's not present truth he said well how do you gonna prove that what Paul and Peter and little problem not our doctrine now come on nowhere the way Peter was behaving itself then what Paul done he just proved him a little bit think about it did Paul do that intentionally or did God do it I thank God led Paul to just kind of help straighten the old boy out and you know Peter never said another word oh you rebuke people to this message to tell them they're wrong and but they're not gonna speak to you from now they're gonna have nothing to do with you Peter he's just lined right back up why because he knew the man that had to present that truth is it right even though Peter opened the door to the Gentiles steal Paul brought the present-day truth you see we've had a message to come all the way down in this age to bring us the present-day truth and tell us what to expect you see most people are only expecting a a warmer than the White House oh that's well and good rush you're coming after all all that's well and good but has he spoke to you from this message they'll let you know where you stand present-day truth one day the Lord spoke to me out of the scripture he says you'll be there with your offspring Bible says tell it like it I'm just telling like it is but you know what I had never referenced a thought about that other than and I explained it to some brethren and they said you mean your children gonna be saved because they're your children I said you don't know what you're talking about I'm saying it never believed no such thing he never talked no genealogies or whatever I said my kids are gonna have an experience of their own not my experience my wife has to have her own experience not my experience he said well what brother do you mean you think all of your children gonna be saved why wouldn't you think your children could be safe now heaven help us come on heaven help us to try to think that if they're not good enough to get saved or to get changed cuz I'm gonna remind you you came from some water I ain't gonna play no games with you I'm gonna ask you where you came from what hole you got duck out of present-day truth well your experience hold you can you say it's brother branham said they said right around it you keep it a religion he said no it kept me we like being a Christian what about a man he got so down-and-out he climbed the fire pole one day and took his gloves off he was going to take his own life that's true what about a man that would take a gun to put his head oh we're not talking about the Prophet like that what about a man had come off the field not just because God took the gift away from him but he was a nervous wreck for what four or five years you came off the field he was a human being but he had the present-day truth least another day where he said had a burden all for years and years and years but then he relates it to when he spoke about the growth on his wife you know and the things and how it was gone he said that burden has left me you think he didn't examine his self every day of how many years was it that his wife carried that growth is he hurted for years it wouldn't even knock because it didn't appear for a long time think about it you think he didn't pray and cry out to God regard to deliver her for that God wouldn't hear him many of us would have ever DISA stayed with it kept on going but one day then God stepped down in a present day word a spoken word president talked and said now you say it he didn't say yeah you've been right you've done good you've live good I'm gonna take that away I think brother branham believed in the present-day truth because you know he wasn't looking for tomorrow or looking back to yesterday come on brothers he was standing in a present that truth can you say that what you believe is present day you're going to be tried right I'm out Ryan never been tried you ever looked at you baby and the doctor told her there's no way they could leave something happened but now let's say something about how he proved himself how many of you would have your baby laying in a I don't know what you'd call it comatose almost eight or whatever it was in in the hospital in the ICU unit yet we were having Bible study he left his baby laying in the hospital even his wife came to church Sunday services never Minister one I don't want to be tried like you I'd fail well you know how much confidence knowledge astray I'd stay like it is most of you can't get here because you can eased or done something you know anything you didn't make ever service cut some little bad cold or something's you know I'm talking about a present-day truth you know what happened to that little baby he said well are you trying to tell us we need to just leave our kids in the hospital see why would you say that I never told him to do it I told him he ought to be there with his child I told his sister sitting up back here or 20 years longer than that if she drove but for 20 years or more I told her I said don't you drive down here every Sunday from Charlotte North Carolina 250 miles down or something like that 250 back I said don't you do that I said I wouldn't do it I said don't do it let's get the tapes we'll send you the tape come down once a month and take communion you know what she's so stubborn she wouldn't listen to me she kept coming it might be that we're proving ourselves I hope you get the point we should have examined ourselves by the word see whether we're in the faith or not but then prove ourselves by the way we live about it but you know after all of these years she'll tell you the truth gonna hurt another sister what I'm talking about they would come down and go back but you know God struck my heart I believe one day and I told him from the pulpit I said don't you go home and you drive five hours or four hours to get home and you walk in your house and your husband say I need some supper let's go I'm tired I went to church I've been serving the Lord you want something Nico get yourself oh he would have ever justifiable right to say that right I mean truth that's it don't you do that I said he might not believe what you believe but you'll never win him into the gospel by being that kind of a person and he asked for something to eat you go get him something to eat go see you prove yourself do we prove whether we're in the faith or not by the way we live but how do you live good know sure don't I'm glad there's an advocate I'm glad there's an advocate but we can't live work nothing the best we can do ain't worth anything well then if it's that way I'll just live it away you will anyway won't live like a devil because that's what you are so you're not proving yourself to whether you be in the faith see if you're in the faith you're gonna be proving what you are you realize we're proving every day what we are before the world is seeing us your sister's going out to Walmart it'll brother wait hey I don't look at us they'll see you walking around they'll see you would you're along higher in your dress isn't it tight and not just seeing you one time they see you weekend we go they don't see you one day with it up another day with it down and whatever they just see you you know that's gonna be a great witness my wife I don't know what it is but everybody wants to make her a singer everywhere she goes first thing people say it not how are you what you sing I guess you must have the looks of a singer you know I believe she can but my point is what people look at you and they see thing in your proving what you are by the way you live where you act even hotter one God water baptism no eternal health surface seat you can hover all the gospel you want to the one to probably say your life is so much I can't see I can't hear your voice Stan well we got rid just a little thought examine yourself if you're in the present they true see if your gospel is present are you having to look back [Music] are you happy to look forward [Music] are you looking straight at what it is now said thank you Lord the combi either that easy [Music] I usually look at that word the Scriptures don't like a combat and the Prophet we talked about it a combine one day he said this he said I hear the coming of the combine he said the World Council of Churches I better examine something right here they called daddy what I've been thinking you know there wasn't a lot wrong with what I was thinking except for one thing I had wrong idea oh you know what that combine does that combine gathers the wheat puts it into a place same combine shoves them stops and tusks and thanks throws it out the other way joy did the World Council of Churches [Music] they're gonna put us in the place we are looking forward to a persecution not tribulation your prophet said it [Music] don't come a persecution [Music] I like waiting do what we've done brother I said the other day said brother damn I can't find something he says me and brother mark talking about had him bomb dissolving or something said we talked about something small relation [Music] he said I I just can't find it brother Dale give me a little time shut down the founders is it even like Cuba or Haiti some small nation could start a nuclear war we want to look at Russia China he said once they push that one button he said everybody else is gonna start pushing their butter he said it'll be over [Music] what am I getting at this message has a right answer we may have to call on one another to teach you certain things in just a little illustration brother right he picked up when I talking about how to search the message [Music] how to do it with that sign computer that mankind uses to destroy the world with we can use that same computer to search this message and realize if we're examining our sale [Music] it's not examining somebody else this examining ourselves [Music] let's forget about ourselves a couple trade on here and worship let he go forth believe in it God's gonna work it all out in the name of Jesus Christ we send these prayer cloths it's been proven if we believe understand you might get some advice so now you work out all of their problems now it'll be well in Jesus and when you're saying holy bang advice let's check our sail [Music] not look around in other people what I get some goodies anybody then ain't go to my let's look at ourselves [Music] I guess being pastors a little different from other things but I've always tried to get you to look at something the Lord allowed me and you've heard me tell this before but he allowed me to stand one day and look at somebody and to explain it there's no way to explain it all at once I went right back inside you know I was looking out like tunnel vision no standing looking at that person and what I'm getting at is at one part when I saw the person that's the natural I was condemning the person maybe had ever gospel rock - okay the when he brought me back into that tunnel and showed me the way he saw the person he's changed my whole outlook I don't look at people anymore thataway I don't look at them as a kind of condemnation I look at it that they're a human being the Lord just let me walk back in just whatever you doing don't ask me I can't explain when I come out of that thinking a whole lot different about everybody but brother damn it just rep rippln to pieces with that word see you're the person if you're thinking like that you're the person it's not examining yourself you're examining everybody Alex you're trying to make this thing run according to you and it's not gonna do it he's gonna run it according to his word just remember the Bible says never how you meted out was it say you'll be measured back to you that's perforated with his clothes front it'll be measured back to you so whatever you look at somebody else just remember that's the way God is looking at you know brother told me when time were told in a group they said brother Branham said brother said for more you staying where I stand he said everything you do is wrong but he said the more I stand were God stands he said everything I do is wrong you've never had a man to try to make some kind of a big show heavily it's what caught me was an honest and sincerity of a man and I remember when he made that statement our phrasing is pretty close but he said do you think that them staunch Jews and how well they were would any of them writers ever wrote of David and all of them and their problems they wouldn't road it said but God made them ride it that's a great way to looking at things in it father we just ask you to let what we've said to not just dwell in our hearts the Lord that we examine ourselves quit examining everybody else and examine our own selves and then it would look to you and did we prove what is that good and acceptable things that God wants make us to believe Lord and to see where we're at because no matter what we look forward or backward we've got to look at the present tense and see where we're standing because only then can we move forward is to know where we're standing be with us on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey let your loving grace be with each one of us in Jesus name you dismissed woman in the Bible days are less being almost gone that's an Elijah take his word no said woman don't you worry God sent me today and before you even ask him help was on the way
