[4:52] still a trooper still standing right
[4:53] there amongst
[4:55] all that that's going on and
[4:58] we will pray that the lord will continue
[5:01] to be with him i want to address one
[5:02] thing
[5:06] i i hate rumors and you hate rumors too
[5:08] and i hate rumors especially when
[5:10] they're lies
[5:11] so there was a rumor started yesterday
[5:14] that sister um
[5:16] frieda duncan
[5:17] had or freda roberts sorry
[5:20] had coveted well that's that's not true
[5:22] that's a lie so
[5:25] i want you to consider the source
[5:27] i don't like rumors anyway but
[5:30] when it comes to this disease or this
[5:32] virus
[5:33] if that gets out in the airwaves
[5:36] everybody goes ballistic i hope she
[5:38] don't have it because she's sitting in
[5:40] my house today
[5:42] right now with sister jim watching the
[5:43] service but she looks very well from to
[5:45] me she's been checking her temperature
[5:47] and just make sure
[5:50] uh but there was a rumor started
[5:51] yesterday and uh wherever the rumor came
[5:53] from was
[5:55] a lie
[5:56] and we don't need to start rumors that
[5:58] we don't know
[6:00] now if if i come out here and say sister
[6:02] dale's got coven then you can we can
[6:04] agree that that's not a rumor that's the
[6:06] truth but when you start rumors that
[6:08] somebody's got something and they don't
[6:10] have it
[6:11] and that goes with everything you need
[6:13] to
[6:14] um
[6:15] there was a there's a wonderful
[6:17] philosopher
[6:19] that was on tv a long time ago
[6:21] and i always use his statements
[6:24] andy nip it at the bud
[6:30] for those of you that don't know that
[6:31] that was
[6:33] barney five
[6:34] he's always saying andy nip it at the
[6:37] bud
[6:38] so nip it at the bud don't go starting
[6:40] rumors that you don't know nothing about
[6:43] especially with this virus because it
[6:46] gets people nervous
[6:48] that we shouldn't have been
[6:50] so so let's let's um be cautious
[6:54] all right be cautious about what we do
[6:56] and
[6:57] and
[6:59] and you know
[7:02] if you don't know it don't say it
[7:05] if it's not the truth all right so it
[7:06] was not the truth since frida does not
[7:08] have coven 19.
[7:10] she's fine
[7:12] like i said as far as far as i could
[7:14] tell last night when she came to the
[7:15] house and then this morning she's fine
[7:17] everything's okay but just keep praying
[7:19] that that we will
[7:21] that this thing will be done away with
[7:24] and that um we'll get back brother uh
[7:27] when i got a message i know some of you
[7:29] know brother howard carroll he's in his
[7:31] 90s he's
[7:32] been in the hospital with it but they
[7:34] say he's on the mend and
[7:37] ready to come back home so we praise god
[7:39] that
[7:40] that um that brother howard there
[7:42] at that age
[7:44] is able to fight that thing it's a fight
[7:47] life is a fight i think yesterday you
[7:49] know everything's a fight
[7:51] you fight off disease your body's
[7:52] fighting disease every day and you don't
[7:54] even know it
[7:56] some things come across through the air
[7:58] through the food how many times have you
[8:00] asked god to bless your food you should
[8:02] every time you put something in your
[8:03] mouth why because there may be something
[8:05] in that food
[8:07] that will affect your body but if you
[8:09] pray to god that that thing will destroy
[8:11] it the demon before the virus before it
[8:14] gets to you so but we still want to be
[8:16] cautious we still want to do the phase
[8:18] one we still want to wear a mask
[8:21] as we leave and downstairs
[8:24] talking make sure you wash your hands
[8:26] and stay
[8:28] six feet apart unless your family
[8:29] members which you hadn't been six feet
[8:31] apart
[8:32] at your house so um but we thank god
[8:35] that um
[8:36] he's give us an absolute
[8:39] and that's jesus christ and that's what
[8:40] we're going to talk about today on this
[8:42] day of atonement
[8:43] there was two goats
[8:47] one is released on the day of atonement
[8:48] and one's killed
[8:50] and we'll see what that is in just a
[8:51] little bit so god bless you um i know we
[8:55] all have unspoken requests again that we
[8:57] have in our heart that whole list like i
[8:59] said brother david siler brother daryl
[9:01] ward
[9:02] um
[9:03] brother richie douglas is coming out of
[9:05] it and his wife
[9:07] all the different ones so it's not just
[9:09] we're not just uh singled out
[9:12] it's all over the country i talked to
[9:14] brother claude last night and there's
[9:16] some brothers in new mexico that really
[9:18] got hit hard and they've had to shut the
[9:19] churches down so
[9:21] so it's it's it's going through but we
[9:24] pray that it goes through
[9:26] and then leaves us right right
[9:29] and that's the way we want to look at
[9:30] today in this day of atonement let's bow
[9:32] our heads dear heavenly father thank you
[9:34] lord for this day
[9:35] thanks for the opportunity that we have
[9:37] to come back to service lord
[9:39] this is truly a feast and it's the feast
[9:42] of the lord and we come to these feasts
[9:43] lord and
[9:44] uh not per se so much as israel would do
[9:47] but lord we go through all these feasts
[9:48] in our life of the passover and the
[9:51] unleavened bread
[9:53] all the different ones lord
[9:56] we live through them as christians every
[9:58] day
[9:59] and now the prophet
[10:01] spoke and told us lord that we are now
[10:03] feasting under the feast of tabernacles
[10:07] which lord is an indwelling lord of the
[10:09] holy spirit
[10:10] in the lives and hearts
[10:13] and the very soul of an individual
[10:15] this is not just a
[10:17] festive good time lord but as we come
[10:19] now
[10:21] to this day of atonement we see that
[10:24] you even told us to afflict our soul
[10:26] all the way down to the very heart of
[10:28] man
[10:29] you haven't required that before in the
[10:31] feast but lord today
[10:33] in this day of atonement you have
[10:34] required it lord
[10:36] and we want to see
[10:38] lord you
[10:40] being our atonement or our ransom or our
[10:43] sacrifice
[10:44] lord you're the
[10:46] ultimate sacrifice you gave your life
[10:50] so you could do away with sin and do
[10:52] away with all these heartaches and
[10:53] troubles that we have
[10:55] lord we're
[10:57] dependent on you to come today and speak
[10:58] to the people be with the ones that are
[11:01] sick the ones that are not here the ones
[11:02] that are here
[11:04] lord we pray that you'd be with us and
[11:06] lead us and guide us by your holy spirit
[11:08] in jesus name we pray
[11:10] amen
[11:11] um feast of the lord we'll talk about
[11:14] today the day of atonement this will be
[11:16] number six
[11:18] it's kind of strange how number six
[11:21] comes into the feast of atonement
[11:23] and it shows right after the feast of
[11:25] trumpets
[11:27] and we'll see that maybe
[11:29] i want you to be able to see
[11:32] and we'll go back
[11:34] later on with i think about last night
[11:36] we're going to go through the plan of
[11:37] redemption because the plan of
[11:38] redemption the seals of the plan of
[11:40] redemption if there's seven seals
[11:42] there's seven trumpets seven vials
[11:44] this is the day of atonement this is
[11:46] number six
[11:48] where israel is going to realize
[11:52] what they did
[11:53] all right
[11:54] and they're going to in symbolic form
[11:56] god told them to do these things so
[11:58] let's read in leviticus 23
[12:00] verse 26 and the lord spake unto moses
[12:03] saying
[12:04] also on the tenth day of the seventh
[12:05] month now we went from the first day
[12:08] a blowing of trumpets now we've come to
[12:11] the
[12:12] seventh month
[12:13] on the tenth day so ten days later there
[12:16] shall be a day of atonement it's one day
[12:19] it shall be in holy convocation unto you
[12:21] and you shall afflict your souls
[12:26] how deep is that
[12:28] you shall afflict your souls
[12:30] and offer an offering made by fire unto
[12:32] the lord and you shall do no work on
[12:35] that same day for it is a day of
[12:37] atonement to make an atonement for you
[12:40] before the lord your god
[12:42] for whosoever soul it be that shall not
[12:44] be afflicted on that same day he shall
[12:47] be cut off from among his people
[12:49] and whatsoever soul that be that doeth
[12:51] any work on that same day that soul will
[12:53] i destroy
[12:56] from among the people
[12:59] listen
[13:00] on that day between christ was put on
[13:01] the cross it was one man
[13:03] he did all the work he's not required
[13:05] that you do any work
[13:09] you just got to believe what he done
[13:11] you shall do no manner of work it shall
[13:13] be a statute forever throughout your
[13:15] generations in all your dwellings
[13:18] it shall be unto you a sabbath of rest
[13:21] and you shall afflict your souls in the
[13:23] ninth day of the month and evening
[13:26] remember it starts at six o'clock from
[13:28] even to even or evening to evening shall
[13:31] you celebrate
[13:33] your sabbath you may be seated in the
[13:34] lord as blessing
[13:36] to the reading of his word so now this
[13:39] is the day of atonement if you will pull
[13:41] the chart up please
[13:42] and we'll kind of put this in pres in
[13:44] perspective
[13:46] and
[13:50] look at it real quick and that way i'll
[13:51] show you exactly where what we're uh
[13:54] where we're at
[13:58] everybody have a good week
[14:00] amen it's been a good week
[14:03] it's been a trial but it's been a good
[14:04] week we made it to church
[14:07] and
[14:08] it was there
[14:09] now it is okay
[14:11] all right
[14:12] so now
[14:14] we are now on the day of atonement which
[14:16] is right here
[14:18] which is a fault one of the fall feasts
[14:21] we'll go back and talk about trumpets
[14:22] just a few minutes because these two tie
[14:24] together
[14:26] and this is your last one here
[14:28] so we're going to take the trumpets but
[14:30] this is one day on the 10th day of
[14:32] tesory which is october
[14:35] we're going to see
[14:37] that god told him one day
[14:40] i want you to i mean go all not just not
[14:43] just afflict your body i want you to
[14:45] mourn i want your soul
[14:48] to know what i did for you
[14:51] because what it's doing is looking back
[14:52] on the day of atonement you're looking
[14:54] all the way back
[14:56] to when it began right here because
[14:58] without this passover lamb being killed
[15:01] you don't have anything to atone for
[15:03] there's no atonement unless you've got
[15:05] the lamb that's killed all right does
[15:07] everybody understand that so that one
[15:09] day of atonement
[15:11] is an important day it is one of the
[15:13] most holy days
[15:15] in
[15:15] all of israel all right so now let's go
[15:18] to and back up now remember the feast of
[15:21] trumpets was on the first day of that
[15:23] month of october
[15:25] october the 1st the 10th and the 15th
[15:27] right in there you got a lot of things
[15:29] going on and it is our what it is our
[15:31] fall harvest month
[15:33] most of our crops even our crops are
[15:35] harvested
[15:36] in october and november somewhere in
[15:38] there so it always coincides with that
[15:42] with that even in our calendar but
[15:44] remember
[15:45] because it's going to be important in
[15:46] just a minute
[15:48] this is the first month of the what
[15:51] religious calendar this is the first
[15:53] month of the jewish religious calendar
[15:55] and it goes 12 months
[15:57] now the civil calendar or the calendar
[16:00] that the jews day by day go by
[16:03] their daily calendar like our daily
[16:05] calendar starts
[16:07] in october
[16:08] all right so that's their civil calendar
[16:11] goes from here to here
[16:13] all right
[16:14] their religious calendar goes from here
[16:16] all the way around to here and it shows
[16:18] these feast days why because the feast
[16:20] days need to be lined up you can't have
[16:24] the spring feast start over here
[16:26] amen
[16:28] and obviously you can't have the fall
[16:30] the fall feast starting over here so god
[16:32] set it up but now remember man said
[16:35] october the 1st
[16:37] god told
[16:38] moses we've read it many times
[16:41] that this is the first month for you
[16:43] when they were coming out of egypt when
[16:45] they were there in the book of exodus
[16:47] god said this is the first month
[16:50] this is the first day of the month this
[16:52] is what's going to happen
[16:54] then on the 14th of that same month
[16:56] we're going to have a passover all right
[16:58] everybody got that say amen
[17:00] all right so we've been through this so
[17:02] passover is what they killed the lamb
[17:05] and they were leaving egypt a type of
[17:07] you and i
[17:08] leaving the world and starting our
[17:10] journey all right now what we're going
[17:12] to do is is we're going to i want you to
[17:14] just kind of
[17:16] put this in the back of your mind
[17:19] that this all coincides with your new
[17:21] birth
[17:24] okay
[17:25] how many you got you got how many stages
[17:28] you got justification sanctification
[17:30] what's unleavened bread cleaning the
[17:31] living out of your house sanctification
[17:34] baptism of the holy ghost you connect
[17:35] these two together the word comes the
[17:38] trumpet blows you come to the message of
[17:40] the hour if you're born again today and
[17:41] you hear the message of the hour you got
[17:43] to come
[17:45] now this is not the holy ghost
[17:49] okay
[17:50] the message is not the holy ghost the
[17:52] holy ghost you can get and receive
[17:55] by listening to the word of god or
[17:57] repenting of your sins and asking god to
[17:58] forgive you and you go through
[18:00] sanctification and then you go through
[18:02] the bat then you come to church and god
[18:04] quickens something in your heart or he
[18:06] brings a minister to say one little
[18:08] thing
[18:10] then then you get the new birth but as
[18:11] you but when you get the new birth it's
[18:13] going to turn you then
[18:16] you're going to hear a what a gospel
[18:18] trumpet you're going to hear the last
[18:21] trumpet
[18:24] you're going to hear the last trump
[18:26] because this is the last trump we're
[18:28] going to talk about that in a minute
[18:30] then you're going to realize to me that
[18:32] day of atonement it makes me realize
[18:36] that that's now in me
[18:40] and then the tabernacles is when we're
[18:41] going to leave all right everybody got
[18:43] that that's the change of the body for
[18:45] us and it will be the change of the body
[18:47] for the jews and when they go in their
[18:49] rapture all right
[18:52] all right
[18:54] so don't fall asleep
[18:57] we'll be all right so let's go to the
[18:59] trumpets because i i we still didn't get
[19:01] finished with the trumpets the other day
[19:03] let's go to
[19:04] leviticus 23 verse 23
[19:08] and the lord spanking to moses saying
[19:10] speaking of the children of israel
[19:12] saying in the seventh month and the
[19:13] first day of the month shall you have a
[19:16] sabbath
[19:17] a memorial of blowing of trumpets and
[19:19] holy convocation
[19:21] you shall do no servile work therein but
[19:23] you shall offer an offering made by fire
[19:26] unto the lord now let's go to isaiah 58
[19:29] 1 because remember
[19:30] the bible speaks of trumpets being a
[19:34] voice
[19:35] being that there may be a natural
[19:38] trumpet sound as we were talking last
[19:39] sunday there may or when yeah last
[19:42] sunday that there's a natural trumpet
[19:45] sounds but there's a voice behind that
[19:49] i mean there's something that even tells
[19:51] you to retreat to move left to move
[19:54] right all the different sounds of a
[19:55] trumpet
[19:57] but we know that the trumpet that's
[19:59] sounding now is not a
[20:01] to do to do trumpet
[20:02] it's a trumpet that is voiced out
[20:05] because watch cry loud spare not lift up
[20:09] thy voice like a trumpet
[20:12] and show thy people their transgressions
[20:14] in the house of jacob their sins that's
[20:16] where uh that i
[20:18] received my commission i believe
[20:20] to minister the gospel was right there
[20:21] in that one scripture
[20:23] and uh because that's what you're doing
[20:26] we all hate it it's a trumpet but listen
[20:28] we're all trumpeters but we can't be
[20:30] blowing
[20:32] c note over here and d note over here
[20:34] and f this and e flat and all these
[20:37] different things you got to be
[20:39] in the same mode of music you got to be
[20:41] able to to
[20:43] we hear luther's trumpet
[20:47] but now luther's trumpet is not my
[20:49] trumpet to take me up that's right amen
[20:52] wesley's trumpet is a trumpet and
[20:55] there's a group of people heard that
[20:57] trumpet they rejoiced under that trumpet
[21:00] and they went up under that or they're
[21:02] going up under that trumpet now they're
[21:03] all in the grave now but they're going
[21:05] up under that trumpet of martin luther
[21:07] john wesley pentecost and now
[21:10] the message of the hour
[21:12] is the last trump
[21:14] it's the last trumpet it's the last
[21:15] thing you're going to hear but now it's
[21:17] not the last thing that israel is going
[21:19] to hear because those trumpets are going
[21:22] to israel
[21:24] to not sound a different sound
[21:27] all right they'll be okay with that
[21:29] all right let's go to ezekiel 33 and
[21:31] that's what we were looking at
[21:33] sunday
[21:36] son of man speak to the children of thy
[21:38] people
[21:39] and say unto them when i bring the sword
[21:42] upon a land if the people of the land
[21:44] take a man of their coast and set him
[21:46] for their watchmen so we're talking
[21:48] about ministers we're talking about
[21:49] fivefold ministry we're talking about
[21:52] now you remember it's not an actual
[21:54] watchman in a tower it's somebody that
[21:56] watches after hebrews
[21:58] 13 tells us is somebody to watch after
[22:01] your soul
[22:03] okay we're preaching to souls today
[22:06] not preaching the bodies
[22:08] that's happened a lot of times they beat
[22:10] you to death and make you do this and
[22:11] make you do that and make you not
[22:13] sisters not cut your hair and your men
[22:15] not do's and don'ts but if you ever get
[22:17] that soul born again
[22:19] now don't say there won't be no worries
[22:22] there will be worries and there'll be
[22:24] troubles and trials but you won't fight
[22:27] what the bible says
[22:29] you won't fight it when it says not to
[22:31] do this and don't do that all right
[22:34] so the watchman is set to do what when
[22:36] he seeth or understandeth the sword come
[22:40] upon the land or the word
[22:43] he blows the trumpet and warns the
[22:45] people then whosoever heareth the sound
[22:47] of the trumpet and taketh not warning if
[22:49] the sword come and take him away his
[22:51] blood shall be upon his own head
[22:55] brother dale's responsible for your soul
[22:58] but
[22:59] if you don't do anything about that
[23:02] it's your problem at the day of judgment
[23:05] it's your problem at the if you don't
[23:07] you understand we can just make a long
[23:09] list it's it's your problem but now
[23:11] remember though if you
[23:13] have a watchman that's not right
[23:17] all right who's ever here at the sound
[23:19] of the trumpet takes not warning a sword
[23:21] come and take him away his blood shall
[23:22] be upon his own head
[23:24] he heard the sound of the trumpet
[23:28] and he took not warning
[23:30] his blood shall be upon him but he that
[23:33] taketh warning shall deliver his soul in
[23:35] other words it won't be on the pastor
[23:38] it'll be on you but if the watchmen see
[23:40] the sword or the
[23:42] false word coming or the enemy coming
[23:45] and blow not the trumpet and the people
[23:48] be not warned
[23:51] that's why we're still here right
[23:53] 50 60 years after the prophet we have
[23:56] not been warned by a proper trumpet
[23:59] and i'm not saying there's not one this
[24:00] is not a one-man job
[24:02] you understand what i mean brother
[24:04] branham was one man we
[24:05] got filtered through him he was a
[24:07] trumpet and we heard what he said but
[24:10] now there are many trumpets
[24:12] but they got to be sounding the same
[24:14] music that's right amen but if the
[24:17] watchmen see the sword come and blow not
[24:19] the trumpet and the people be not warned
[24:22] oh it's all right you can do what you
[24:23] want to
[24:24] if the sword come and take any person
[24:26] from among them he is taken away in his
[24:28] own iniquity iniquity is what knowing to
[24:31] do right or not doing it
[24:33] but his blood will i require at the
[24:36] watchman's
[24:37] hand so it will be
[24:39] that's why there'll be many people
[24:42] we read the scripture where the bible
[24:43] tells us
[24:45] that many will come in that day and say
[24:47] lord lord have i not
[24:50] cast out devils have i not
[24:52] spoken tongues have i not done these
[24:54] great mighty things
[24:56] and you know what god's going to tell
[24:57] them he's going to say look
[24:59] you were the wrong trumpet
[25:03] you were sounding your own message or
[25:05] you were sounding this and that and the
[25:07] other and you were not proclaiming
[25:09] my message and we see them now they just
[25:12] leave the message they don't proclaim
[25:13] the wrong trumpet they're just leaving
[25:15] their people are throwing the trumpet
[25:17] down well they never had the right
[25:18] trumpet to start with
[25:20] they never had the right trumpet to
[25:22] start with if they had the right trumpet
[25:23] this trumpet takes us to the body change
[25:27] this trumpet we're sounding today
[25:30] in the message of the hour around the
[25:32] world will take us to a body change it
[25:35] will not take us
[25:38] to false doctrine right
[25:41] amen
[25:43] so in the feast of the trumpets it was a
[25:45] blowing
[25:47] of trumpets but now remember don't get
[25:49] it wrong with the seven trumpets of
[25:51] revelations eight because they will
[25:53] sound with seven different angels
[25:56] sounding trumpets that's not to us
[25:59] don't worry about that we're not gonna
[26:01] be here remember brother branham was
[26:02] gonna preach the feast of the trumpets
[26:04] he are the seven trumpets seven vials
[26:07] seven plagues and then god told him said
[26:10] you preached him supernaturally what in
[26:12] the sixth seal which what is the sixth
[26:14] seal two prophets going to israel taking
[26:17] them the message and then the plagues
[26:20] falling on the earth but we're gone
[26:23] we're not here that's why brother brown
[26:24] said they're not to us
[26:26] the trumpets of revelation 7 but now
[26:28] this feast of the trumpets is to us
[26:32] that feast of the trumpets that you've
[26:34] got to hear that trumpet sound every day
[26:36] and you've got to determine by your
[26:39] filter
[26:40] whether it's right or wrong
[26:43] whether it's the right sound or the
[26:44] wrong sound
[26:46] all right let's read here
[26:48] first corinthians 14 verse 7
[26:51] and even things without life giving
[26:53] sound whether pipe or harp
[26:55] except they give a distinction
[26:58] in the sound
[27:00] how shall it be known what is piped or
[27:02] heart
[27:04] in other words how do you know that what
[27:05] i'm saying today is right how do you
[27:07] know that what brother branham said was
[27:09] right how do you know that
[27:11] because that trumpet gives a certain
[27:13] sound and a certain tone or a certain
[27:16] ring and what it rings inside of you
[27:20] as we were talking before
[27:22] last sunday
[27:23] you'd be sitting in a congregation and
[27:25] and this preacher gets up and he's
[27:27] preaching all these false doctrine and
[27:28] all these people are shouting and
[27:29] praising the lord and you're just
[27:30] sitting there why there's something
[27:32] about that sound you're hearing that's
[27:35] not right
[27:37] amen we've all been there
[27:39] if not get ready that's right you will
[27:42] experience it somewhere in your life
[27:48] for if the trumpet given uncertain sound
[27:52] who shall prepare himself to the battle
[27:56] now the whole deal with the watchmen
[27:57] here
[27:59] the whole deal with that watchman
[28:01] he don't just go up there
[28:03] and blow through a horn
[28:08] he's trained
[28:10] he's trying to give you the note give
[28:13] you the sound
[28:14] the sound of retreat is a certain
[28:16] cadence the sound of charge is a certain
[28:19] cadence but you know what you got to
[28:20] learn that before that happens
[28:23] you don't learn on the day of battle
[28:24] brother don he was in the military some
[28:26] of you were in the military you didn't
[28:27] learn now that was a lot of things you
[28:29] learned on the fly that's for sure but
[28:31] if you were out there in the heat of
[28:32] battle they trained you before i like
[28:34] what brother harris said brother harris
[28:35] said
[28:36] that drill instructor
[28:38] i hated his guts and he said i was
[28:41] physically
[28:42] so he said i so hated the man he said i
[28:45] wanted to survive vietnam and come back
[28:47] and kill him
[28:51] he said the drill instructor said that's
[28:53] exactly what i want you to do
[28:57] survive
[28:59] if you want to come back and kill me
[29:00] it'd be me and you
[29:02] but he made him survive out there
[29:05] with a will to live to get back home and
[29:08] that's what's happening with all of us
[29:10] with all this going on with all these
[29:12] uncertain sounds going off
[29:14] there is a true sound folks it this is
[29:17] not something that god was
[29:19] caught off guard he knew this was going
[29:21] to happen he allowed this to happen
[29:24] i always go back to job here's job
[29:26] living the life of a king on earth
[29:28] everybody loved job job was a great man
[29:32] god said um hey devil
[29:35] you ever considered that guy over there
[29:39] he said well now god you've got some
[29:41] prayer cloths over the doors
[29:45] and all jobs cars or donkeys whatever it
[29:48] was in what cars was it
[29:50] you've got a hands around him you got
[29:52] all these
[29:53] he said okay i'll tuck him away
[29:57] i'll take him away
[30:00] he trusted job right so much
[30:04] until he lifted it up just a little bit
[30:06] so that the devil could get in but you
[30:08] know what it done it gave glory to god
[30:11] not the devil because the devil lost
[30:13] that battle
[30:15] there's no doubt the devil lost that one
[30:17] amen
[30:18] because what did job do he got restored
[30:20] double what he had before
[30:24] seven children in glory and seven
[30:26] children on earth
[30:27] fifteen thousand or whatever it was of
[30:29] cattle that he had only seven or eight
[30:31] thousand he had double that so
[30:33] in the end job was more blessed than he
[30:36] was in the beginning but now while
[30:38] listen while we're going through this
[30:40] and while job was going through this job
[30:42] probably
[30:44] probably
[30:46] in his humanity thought man this can't
[30:48] get no worse than this
[30:51] and i don't that's why he said he then
[30:53] job pops up and he says oh that i was
[30:55] never born
[30:57] that i never that i died before i took
[30:59] one breath
[31:01] from all that's coming on me but you
[31:03] know what elihu comes on the scene and
[31:05] he just tells job stand up
[31:09] get off your heat stand up and i'm going
[31:12] to tell you what god's going to do for
[31:13] you
[31:15] job says i know my redeemer liveth and
[31:17] you know also
[31:18] job says in job 30-something i think it
[31:21] is job says
[31:23] i found a ransom
[31:25] well you know what ransom means
[31:27] atonement we're fixing to talk about
[31:28] that ransom me in other words job had
[31:31] found an atonement for what he had done
[31:34] and the things in his life so okay we'll
[31:36] get to that i got a little ahead of you
[31:37] first corinthians 15 verse 51
[31:40] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[31:43] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[31:45] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[31:48] at the last trump
[31:51] for the trumpet shall sound now we've
[31:53] heard that
[31:55] that is a gospel trumpet that we are
[31:57] hearing now
[31:59] we're not going to go out in the grave
[32:01] and all get horns and go
[32:05] no there's going to be a sound let's
[32:07] think about this there's going to be a
[32:08] sound that that sixth dimension has
[32:10] never heard in this dimension before
[32:14] something's gonna sound and say hey
[32:17] death has been destroyed in a group of
[32:20] people
[32:22] don't be afraid to come over here
[32:27] oh come on people
[32:29] that's as true as
[32:32] god's won
[32:34] that'll happen we're looking at it right
[32:36] here we're not looking for well we're
[32:38] going to just we're going to bank on
[32:40] brother branham's trumpet being part of
[32:44] no it was the last trumpet
[32:48] and the trump
[32:51] the trumpet that the last trump
[32:54] brother branham brought us to trump
[32:57] to shout the voice we saw we'll see that
[32:58] in a minute for the trumpet shall sound
[33:01] where is it sounding
[33:03] in the people
[33:06] columbus trumpet sounded in the people
[33:10] luther's trumpet sounded in the people
[33:13] the prophet's message is sounding he
[33:16] said rapturing faith lies in these books
[33:19] and tapes
[33:20] we've just got to get all the uncertain
[33:23] sounds out of the way
[33:26] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[33:27] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[33:30] shall be changed for this corruptable
[33:32] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[33:33] must put on immortality so when this
[33:36] corruptable shall have put on
[33:37] incorruption
[33:38] and this mortal shall have put on
[33:40] immortality then shall be brought to
[33:42] pass the same that is written death is
[33:43] swallowed up
[33:45] i like that death is swallowed up
[33:48] in victory
[33:51] because we caught the last
[33:53] trumpet's message
[33:55] and we not only just heard it
[33:58] we became it
[34:00] that's our whole deal we've got to
[34:02] become that
[34:04] because watch this revelations 4 verse
[34:06] 1.
[34:09] now we know revelations 1 john was
[34:11] standing he heard the voice of the
[34:12] trumpet and when he turned what did he
[34:14] see he saw the bride
[34:17] in the church ages
[34:19] one like the son of man with his hands
[34:21] out like this with the church ages which
[34:23] is what in bride form gerd about the
[34:25] paps
[34:26] now here's another trumpet not a
[34:28] different one
[34:29] but this one that makes a sound for us
[34:32] to leave the place
[34:33] after this i looked and behold a door
[34:35] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[34:38] i heard as it were of a trumpet
[34:42] talking to me
[34:44] which said come up hither and i will
[34:46] show you these things which must be
[34:48] hereafter immediately i was in the
[34:49] spirit behold the throne was set in
[34:51] heaven and one said on the throne so
[34:53] john was caught up
[34:55] in a voice like a trumpet
[34:58] which was no other trumpet than the one
[35:00] you're hearing now
[35:02] the one that we're hearing now that
[35:03] we've come in under this last trump
[35:07] for the trumpet shall sound
[35:10] time shall be no more for me and you
[35:14] but now remember we were reading the
[35:16] commentary now just for a second
[35:19] and you don't have the one for the feast
[35:20] of the trumpets
[35:22] because i want you to remember something
[35:27] there is a trumpet
[35:31] that is connected
[35:33] to the day of atonement so just hang on
[35:35] just a minute
[35:36] but the feast of the trumpets begins 10
[35:39] days of consecration can you pull the
[35:41] chart back up please
[35:43] begins 10 days of consecration and
[35:45] repentance before god
[35:48] so when that trumpet blows
[35:51] it's not just that well we're we're done
[35:53] we no there's 10 days
[35:56] that goes by that they're blowing that
[35:59] trumpet
[36:00] and there's 10 days because you know
[36:02] that on that tenth day
[36:07] listen
[36:09] god required on that tenth day
[36:12] a day of atonement not only
[36:16] to reflect but you couldn't
[36:19] eat
[36:21] you had to fast
[36:26] you couldn't do no work
[36:29] you couldn't even go into your wife
[36:32] no relations that whole day that day was
[36:34] an affliction of your soul that you were
[36:37] going to reflect on what god has done
[36:40] for you
[36:41] and we'll read that in just a minute
[36:44] but on the feast of the trumpet see
[36:48] so we've come through justification
[36:50] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[36:52] we've got into the word and what we're
[36:54] hearing now
[36:55] a trumpet
[36:57] a trumpet has sounded and you and i have
[37:00] going we are heading toward the day of
[37:02] atonement
[37:04] just like israel we're going to see that
[37:06] too
[37:07] we are in type they are in
[37:10] reality
[37:13] even one of the commentators says that
[37:16] israel now
[37:18] does not like the day of atonement
[37:21] see they have no sacrifice to make right
[37:24] so it's just a day that they can't do
[37:26] anything
[37:27] and even nominal jews are not supposed
[37:28] to do anything and they don't like that
[37:31] why well they're not born again
[37:34] they don't know god they think their
[37:36] god's coming
[37:37] all right they think they've got to go
[37:38] way back over here that's why that when
[37:41] the two witnesses go to israel and they
[37:43] sound their trumpet
[37:45] it's going to bring them to the day of
[37:46] atonement we'll read it in just a few
[37:48] minutes
[37:49] then they're going to take a tabernacle
[37:51] change and you and i are taking a
[37:53] tabernacle change to me i think now
[37:56] i was thinking the other day
[38:00] what greater time
[38:02] to be under the day of atonement
[38:05] i know we're feasting under the feast of
[38:06] tabernacles we're feasting
[38:09] but what about a day of atonement where
[38:11] we have all this sickness and we have
[38:13] all this trouble going on in the uh just
[38:16] in our ranks
[38:19] why not have a solemn day right why not
[38:22] have a solemn fast
[38:26] don't declare it remember don't like
[38:28] brother don't declare oh i'm going fast
[38:30] for the no
[38:32] just silently
[38:34] one day
[38:36] take you a day
[38:38] doesn't matter what day it is
[38:41] but afflict your soul
[38:43] because my
[38:44] soul sure my body hurts i'm getting
[38:47] older
[38:48] but my soul grieves for the people
[38:51] that are in the hospital for the people
[38:52] that are in this message that have tried
[38:55] their best to serve god we've tried
[38:58] together back together it's done uh
[39:00] people's having weddings and people
[39:02] having meetings
[39:03] and this thing has come back among them
[39:05] and you're wondering what in the world
[39:07] but i always go back to the thing with
[39:09] the prayer cloth
[39:10] we were protected and then all of a
[39:12] sudden god says all right devil
[39:14] let's see how they'll react
[39:16] you see how they'll react because
[39:19] i know how they're going to react
[39:20] because i know the end of the story
[39:22] the devil does not know the end of the
[39:23] story
[39:24] that's why he keeps fighting but on this
[39:26] feast of trumpets it's the beginning of
[39:29] 10 days of consecration and repentance
[39:32] before god now when is it though it's at
[39:35] the harvest time
[39:38] we're not supposed to be getting more
[39:40] likes folks we're supposed to be getting
[39:42] more sincere
[39:43] we're supposed to be heading towards
[39:45] something that i'm telling you when
[39:47] brother branham said cancer would be a
[39:49] toothache
[39:51] compared to what's coming
[39:53] it's here
[39:55] right it's here
[39:57] cancer is bad but they've had a lot of
[39:59] progress in cancer but if this thing
[40:01] ever gets you and it doubles on top of
[40:02] something you're in trouble
[40:05] a pre-existing condition you understand
[40:07] what i'm saying
[40:10] but listen
[40:11] this means a shout
[40:13] or a blowing
[40:16] it commemorates the end of the
[40:17] agriculture and festival year so now
[40:19] we're coming to the autumn of our year
[40:23] we're getting ready to be harvested
[40:25] jesus said hang on don't harvest right
[40:28] now
[40:29] wait till they mature
[40:31] in the harvest season and then you'll
[40:33] know the difference between the wheat
[40:35] and the tares
[40:36] because really when you first start your
[40:38] garden
[40:39] i was thinking yesterday when i was up
[40:41] there pulling up corn in the garden
[40:44] you start out and
[40:46] truly weeds look the same as plants when
[40:48] they begin
[40:50] because you don't know which one to cut
[40:52] down
[40:53] and i've inadvertently cut a few plants
[40:55] down
[40:56] hoeing my garden
[40:58] but if you let them get on up a little
[41:00] higher
[41:01] let them mature a little more you'll
[41:03] start seeing the difference between a
[41:05] weed
[41:06] and wheat or the weed and a piece of
[41:08] corn i also yesterday talk about you
[41:11] talk about multiplication
[41:14] just getting off of this for a minute
[41:15] but i
[41:17] we got close to 800 ears of corn off of
[41:20] our off of our garden and
[41:24] believe me
[41:27] i know there's that many we counted them
[41:32] but i was up there and it's probably
[41:34] what t twice the size of this room maybe
[41:38] the just where the corn was at
[41:41] and i pulled them stalks up the other
[41:42] day and i pulled all of them up last
[41:45] night
[41:45] yesterday
[41:47] day before
[41:48] then big old stalks that already took
[41:50] the ears off of it and there's piles
[41:52] this high
[41:53] of corn stalks i'm making a point here
[41:57] you know what that came from
[42:00] all those 800 ears of corn we put up
[42:02] giveaway sold and done everything else
[42:04] with we've got all that food in our
[42:06] freezer in our refrigerator
[42:08] we've got all these stalks that the corn
[42:10] the cows are going to enjoy once we give
[42:12] them to the cows there's there's about
[42:14] three piles no three piles this high and
[42:16] one pile this eye
[42:18] what's my point every bit of that
[42:22] all of that
[42:25] came from one seed
[42:28] and let's just put it more like this
[42:31] all that
[42:32] poundage
[42:34] hundreds of pounds
[42:36] i bought in a bag of seeds to plant the
[42:38] whole garden about this big
[42:41] so see spiritual multiplication is the
[42:43] same identical way god can take nothing
[42:46] he can take one seed
[42:49] he was what he was the first fruit the
[42:51] first seed to come to maturity which
[42:54] meant there was more of us coming
[42:57] that you and i come to maturity because
[42:59] of that one seed because remember that
[43:01] one seed is who christ and then you and
[43:04] i if we have christ inside of us we're
[43:06] that one seed
[43:10] and think of think of brother danny if
[43:13] we took all them 800 ears
[43:15] and let them dry out
[43:18] how many hundreds of thousands of seed
[43:21] we would have off of that one off that
[43:23] one little bag of seeds so see spiritual
[43:25] multiplication is the same way you've
[43:27] got to hear the trumpet you've got to
[43:28] get under
[43:30] you've got to get under the sun s-o-n
[43:34] you've got to get the rain
[43:35] former ladder rain
[43:38] so that's what we're coming to we're cut
[43:40] we're not coming now look
[43:42] some are here some have just received
[43:45] the baptism of the holy ghost they're
[43:46] that 11th hour worker that's going to
[43:49] get paid just as much as the ones that
[43:51] started all the way back here a long
[43:53] time ago amen thank god for that
[43:56] thank god for that parable that people
[43:57] are not left behind
[44:00] i don't know why in the world you would
[44:02] make a christian
[44:03] movie called left behind
[44:10] think about that one
[44:12] we don't leave nobody behind
[44:14] god's not gonna leave him god's not
[44:15] gonna we're not gonna take a rapture and
[44:17] god's gonna go
[44:18] missed one no he's gonna take everyone
[44:22] but it's up to you to get ready
[44:25] and we're going through these feasts
[44:26] listen folks we are in the evening time
[44:30] we are in the harvest the evening time
[44:33] we're we've we've been through all this
[44:34] and some are coming through this but
[44:36] you're going to come to it fast
[44:38] we've heard the trumpet we're coming to
[44:40] the day of atonement and now we're
[44:42] feasting under the feast of tabernacles
[44:44] which is god
[44:45] tabernacled
[44:47] in human flesh the commentator says here
[44:50] there was an alarm of sorts and can be
[44:51] understood as a call to introspect and
[44:54] repentance
[44:57] in the new testament we see the lord's
[44:58] second coming will be accompanied by the
[45:00] sound of a trumpet now most of the world
[45:03] thinks it's going to be
[45:05] the sound of a trumpet
[45:09] no
[45:11] the gospel trumpet you're hearing now
[45:13] this is the only sound
[45:15] this world is going to get unless
[45:17] there's two witnesses going over the two
[45:18] witnesses this is it there's no other
[45:21] sound and thank god for the for the
[45:23] different ones the you know you got
[45:25] hagees and all the different ones out
[45:27] there that are trying their best to
[45:28] preach the gospel but they do not have
[45:31] this last gospel trumpet you and i are
[45:35] the recipients and the hearers of this
[45:38] last gospel trumpet all right amen i'll
[45:41] clap myself too because thank god
[45:44] because you take a you take a tape and
[45:47] and you take a tape to some of your
[45:49] buddies and you you let them listen to
[45:51] brother branham and and what happens to
[45:53] us when we when we press play which is
[45:55] okay to press play
[45:57] but what happens we turn our attention
[45:59] to that we know that sound
[46:01] we know that voice but more than that
[46:04] brother kern we know what's behind that
[46:06] voice
[46:07] it's the voice of god
[46:10] now the hagies and i'm i'm saying it but
[46:12] john hage you know they do the best they
[46:14] can they're trying their best
[46:16] but they are not the last trumpet
[46:18] they're not one of the seven stars
[46:20] they're not one of the seven spirits
[46:23] they're just not that now they could be
[46:25] anything else
[46:27] uh like um um
[46:29] a billy graham and oral roberts they had
[46:31] a trumpet they went down to sodom and
[46:33] declared brother brown said they blinded
[46:36] those sodomites
[46:40] that's their trumpet
[46:41] but now i can't feed off oral robbers
[46:44] trumpet
[46:46] we can pick things out of it yeah we can
[46:48] pick things out of billy graham
[46:51] but that's not our trumpet folks
[46:54] but now listen this is what i'm leading
[46:55] up to because when we realize that god
[47:00] as brother dale's talking about being
[47:02] we've chosen in him before the
[47:03] foundation of the world our names were
[47:05] written in the lamb's book of life
[47:06] before the foundation of the world
[47:08] because of god's foreknowledge knowing
[47:11] you would hear that trumpet sound
[47:14] and you would respond different
[47:17] right than your neighbor that's right
[47:19] amen amen
[47:22] because see they may hear the hagies and
[47:24] the different ones
[47:27] and and and gravitate to it
[47:30] copeland's not you know all the big name
[47:32] guys and they may well now i don't
[47:38] i don't i don't search out
[47:40] to listen to these folks now they do
[47:43] good for the people that hear them now
[47:44] don't get me wrong
[47:46] okay but because there's a lot of
[47:48] foolish virgin out there there's a lot
[47:49] of people that's going to come up so
[47:50] high and not go any further but remember
[47:53] they're not part of this harvest
[47:57] they are not you are the only ones
[48:00] that's a part of this harvest right here
[48:03] and see when i do that it doesn't make
[48:06] me feel
[48:08] so high and mighty it puts me right here
[48:13] then i mourn
[48:15] for those that can't hear it
[48:17] and i mourn
[48:19] because god you chose me
[48:23] you know i would hear that sound and the
[48:25] way i would respond
[48:28] you've done all this for me
[48:32] see that puts me that afflicts my soul
[48:35] that goes all the way down deep
[48:37] when you know that how many times
[48:39] brother zach how many times listen just
[48:41] walk through the world
[48:45] they hear no sound except politics
[48:49] talking heads
[48:51] this talk show
[48:53] that talk show
[48:54] all their rapper stars and all their
[48:56] movie stars you see what satan has just
[48:59] he's expanded his kingdom and he's given
[49:02] you so much noise
[49:07] noise
[49:09] that's right and that's what he's done
[49:12] god has given us the trumpet amen
[49:15] for us to respond to satan has given a
[49:17] trumpet to the world and whatever it is
[49:19] rap
[49:21] rock and
[49:22] country and all these different he's
[49:24] just throwing it out there
[49:27] but let me tell you something folks
[49:30] you being a crowd of people
[49:33] you let danny fountain
[49:34] get separated from ellie
[49:36] in in a crowd
[49:39] and they might be screaming they might
[49:40] be shouting they might be
[49:42] uh you know
[49:44] cursing and yakking and talking and
[49:47] screaming
[49:48] but you let ellie say
[49:51] what she call you
[49:52] granddad grandan
[49:55] what
[49:56] he don't hear no other noise
[49:59] right
[50:00] i can tell deanna's voice from anybody
[50:02] don't even have to look
[50:04] same way with god that's right
[50:06] all this noise brother zach was going on
[50:09] this whole world there was noise going
[50:11] on and all of a sudden you decided
[50:15] you decided
[50:16] to say father
[50:20] i need some help
[50:21] i don't believe god he never heard any
[50:23] other voice
[50:25] there was no other voice he heard
[50:28] but zach black's voice now what about a
[50:30] god that created the universe brother
[50:32] boy created this everything and all of a
[50:34] sudden he goes what do you need
[50:38] what do you need
[50:40] to me that's the atonement
[50:43] what do you need
[50:44] right
[50:45] i'm here for you and you go
[50:47] god what's the first thing you say i'm
[50:49] not worthy
[50:50] that's right all right huh amen
[50:53] god i'm not worthy
[50:56] to be counted among god i'm not worthy
[50:58] because my sin has piled up and piled up
[51:01] and piled up
[51:06] but god says i hear your voice
[51:08] you've heard my trumpet
[51:10] and not only has he saved your soul
[51:13] he's brought you to an endtime message
[51:16] he's brought you to the very last trump
[51:19] that only will bring a resurrection
[51:24] only
[51:25] the others will not bring a resurrection
[51:27] this will only bring a resurrection
[51:31] oh
[51:32] what a day of atonement
[51:35] where you just and yeah we ought to be
[51:37] happy but you ought to be inside you you
[51:40] want to thank god
[51:41] why me
[51:47] and i'll promise you he'll tell you why
[51:50] he'll tell you why
[51:55] because john knew that voice of jesus
[51:56] and when he said it said it sounded like
[51:58] the sound of a trumpet he said when i
[52:00] turned and looked
[52:01] i didn't see jesus
[52:04] i saw jesus in bride form
[52:07] so the bride was connected
[52:11] to him amen so you and i
[52:14] are connected
[52:16] listen we're the body
[52:18] we're the body he's the head we're the
[52:20] body right
[52:21] the whole bible tells us we're the body
[52:23] of christ
[52:24] so he has no body without me and you
[52:26] that's right amen well what a day of
[52:29] atonement but let's let's get into the
[52:30] day atonement real quick
[52:33] leviticus 23 26.
[52:36] i want you to think about these trumpets
[52:38] now hold on just a second for 10 days
[52:42] they're going to sound for 10 days
[52:44] working up to this one day
[52:46] where everything's silent
[52:50] silence in heaven
[52:52] silence a day of atonement no work
[52:55] you can't even cook
[52:58] can't go anywhere with your family
[53:01] nothing
[53:03] one day
[53:07] to reflect
[53:09] on what god's done for you
[53:11] day of atonement leviticus 23 26 let's
[53:14] read it
[53:15] excuse me
[53:16] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[53:18] also on the tenth day of the seventh
[53:20] month now remember that's the tenth day
[53:22] there shall be a day of atonement it
[53:24] shall be a holy convocation unto you and
[53:26] you shall afflict your souls
[53:29] and offer an offering made of fire unto
[53:31] the lord and you shall do no work in
[53:32] that same day for it is a day of
[53:34] atonement to make an atonement for you
[53:38] before the lord your god all right and
[53:40] we're going to read what's going on but
[53:41] let's look at the hebrew lexicon
[53:43] and see what this word
[53:45] atonement means
[53:48] to cover
[53:50] to purge
[53:51] make reconciliation the bible tells us
[53:54] oh let me tell you something about
[53:55] atonement
[53:57] it's mentioned 70 times in the bible
[54:01] 69 of them in the old testament there's
[54:03] only one time
[54:05] in the book of romans the bible talks
[54:07] about why
[54:09] you don't need a day of a day of
[54:11] atonement once christ died you don't
[54:13] need that day anymore
[54:15] there was a day of atonement
[54:17] but you don't need that day ever every
[54:19] year remember in romans 8 it says the
[54:21] sacrifice being made every year would
[54:24] make the comer there and two perfect you
[54:26] don't need to sacrifice again if it
[54:27] makes you perfect but it only covered
[54:30] but then paul talks about a ministry of
[54:33] reconciliation to reconcile us back to
[54:36] christ
[54:39] to cover over with pitch
[54:42] you can ask noah about that
[54:45] what carried noah over was what he
[54:47] pitched
[54:51] um
[54:52] to cover over pacifi pacify propitiate
[54:56] to cover over atone for sin
[54:59] make atonement for so something has got
[55:02] when you come to the day of atonement
[55:04] atonement means that we're going to
[55:06] cover over now remember that was in the
[55:09] old testament
[55:10] it covered your sin
[55:12] right
[55:13] that blood of that animal
[55:16] and the blood of that goat whatever it
[55:19] was it at the time
[55:22] it atoned for your sin you were covered
[55:26] but your sin was still there
[55:28] but now when christ come
[55:30] takes it completely away all
[55:32] right to cover over a tone for sin
[55:37] and like i said before
[55:38] uh the other definition
[55:40] is ransom
[55:43] see because remember brother brown said
[55:44] you got yourself put in a pawn shop
[55:48] now to get something out of a pawn shop
[55:50] what happens you got to pay a ransom
[55:52] or you got to pay a fee
[55:54] but it's a ransom because what it does
[55:56] it redeems
[55:58] what was taken to the pawn shop
[56:00] so that's what god does he went in and
[56:01] paid your ransom
[56:03] he made an atonement for you
[56:06] he didn't just to cover over he atoned
[56:08] in other words he took your place
[56:10] because what we're going to see is in
[56:12] just a minute what happens
[56:14] on the day of atonement all right so
[56:16] let's read now
[56:18] uh this is
[56:20] kind of what we've been we've been
[56:22] staying with the
[56:23] uh questions in the bible or or
[56:26] gotquestions.com
[56:27] and it it seems to me to be really close
[56:31] to what the uh
[56:33] what we want you to see so watch this
[56:34] right here
[56:37] i'll get out here when i read it the day
[56:38] of atonement leviticus 23 is also known
[56:41] as yon
[56:43] kippur now yam
[56:45] means day
[56:47] and kippur means like first of the year
[56:49] so this would be like i said before this
[56:51] is the first of the year for their civil
[56:54] calendar you got to remember that
[56:55] because i'm going to read you something
[56:56] in a minute that's going to help you
[56:58] with
[57:00] um
[57:01] leviticus 25 8 all right
[57:04] seven sevens 49 years
[57:06] was the most solemn holy day of all the
[57:08] israelites feasts and festivals
[57:10] occurring once a year on the tenth day
[57:12] of test read the seventh month of the
[57:13] hebrew calendar which is october for us
[57:17] on that day the high priest was to
[57:19] perform elaborate rituals to atone for
[57:21] the sins of the people
[57:23] now what happens is
[57:25] is as we read this
[57:28] aaron
[57:29] when he goes in
[57:31] daily or weekly and does the sacrifices
[57:35] he's got on the epod he's got on the
[57:37] colorful things when he goes in on the
[57:40] day of atonement it's pretty much all
[57:41] white clothing
[57:43] he's just plain
[57:45] okay
[57:46] he's approaching god
[57:48] because he's instead of god and really
[57:50] he was he went for the people but now
[57:53] he's going in not just to make an
[57:54] atonement for israel he's going to make
[57:57] an atonement for himself
[57:59] and make an atonement for even the holy
[58:02] place or the altar watch
[58:04] the most solemn holy day on that day the
[58:06] high priest was to perform elaborate
[58:08] rituals to atone for the sins of the
[58:09] people described in leviticus 16. if you
[58:11] want to read that save time the
[58:13] atonement ritual began with aaron our
[58:15] subsequent high priest of israel coming
[58:18] into the holy of holies
[58:19] the so
[58:21] the solemnity of the day was underscored
[58:25] by god telling moses to warn aaron to
[58:27] not to come into the most holy place
[58:30] whenever he felt like it
[58:33] see now i'm talking about old testament
[58:34] now that's not us
[58:36] you and i now are to come boldly because
[58:38] the thing has the the curtain's been
[58:40] pulled back
[58:41] but it had to begin somewhere in type
[58:44] all right
[58:45] this olympus olympia the solomon entity
[58:48] of the day was underscored by god
[58:50] telling moses to warn aaron not to come
[58:52] in the most holy place whenever he felt
[58:53] like it he could only come on this
[58:55] special day once a year lest he die this
[58:58] was not a ceremony to be taken lightly
[59:01] and the people were to understand that
[59:04] atonement for sin was to be done god's
[59:06] way
[59:08] before entering the tabernacle aaron was
[59:10] debated and put on special garments then
[59:12] sacrificed a bull for the sin offering
[59:15] for himself
[59:16] and his family first all right
[59:19] me and my household
[59:21] the blood of bull was to be sprinkled on
[59:23] the ark of the covenant then aaron was
[59:25] to bring two goats now here we come
[59:27] we're going to read what brother brown
[59:28] says about this but there's two goats
[59:30] one's a goat this sacrifice and one's
[59:32] called a what scapegoat all right
[59:36] the other goat was used as a scapegoat
[59:38] but whatever its blood was sprinkled on
[59:41] the ark of the covenant the other goat
[59:42] was used as a scapegoat aaron placed his
[59:44] hands on his head confessed over it the
[59:46] rebellion and wickedness of the
[59:48] israelites what about all that
[59:50] aaron
[59:52] was transferring that to the
[59:54] animal
[59:55] as a covering though not to do away from
[59:59] because you know what he's going to do
[1:00:00] next year he's got to go back in and do
[1:00:02] the same thing
[1:00:04] all right
[1:00:05] but christ does not have to get back on
[1:00:06] the cross
[1:00:08] he's done he's finished he doesn't have
[1:00:10] to do that we've just got to look in our
[1:00:13] day of atonement and look back and see
[1:00:14] what he'd done for us
[1:00:17] aaron placed his hands on the head
[1:00:18] confessed over it the rebellion and
[1:00:20] wickedness of the israelites and sent
[1:00:22] the goat out with an appointed man
[1:00:26] who released it into the wilderness
[1:00:29] the goat carried on itself all the sins
[1:00:32] of the people which were forgiven for
[1:00:35] another year the symbolic significance
[1:00:37] of the ritual particularly the
[1:00:39] christians is seen first in the washing
[1:00:41] and cleansing of the high priest the man
[1:00:43] who released the goat and the man who
[1:00:45] took the sacrifice animals outside the
[1:00:47] camp to burn the carcass because
[1:00:48] remember jesus was crucified where
[1:00:50] outside the camp all right israelite
[1:00:52] washing ceremonies were required often
[1:00:54] throughout the old testament and
[1:00:56] symbolize the need for mankind to be
[1:00:58] cleansed of sin just like you and i we
[1:01:00] have sins that we have daily sins as
[1:01:02] christians we ask god to wash us not by
[1:01:04] natural water but by spiritual water
[1:01:06] washing of the water of the word
[1:01:08] but it wasn't
[1:01:10] until jesus came to make the once for
[1:01:13] all sacrifice that the need for
[1:01:15] cleansing ceremonies ceased the blood of
[1:01:18] bulls and goats could only atone for
[1:01:20] sins if the ritual was continually done
[1:01:23] year after year while christ's sacrifice
[1:01:26] was sufficient for all the sins of all
[1:01:29] who would ever ever believe in him when
[1:01:32] his sacrifice was made he declared it is
[1:01:34] finished he sat down on the right hand
[1:01:37] of god and no further sacrifice was ever
[1:01:40] needed the sufficiency and completeness
[1:01:42] of the sacrifice of christ is also seen
[1:01:45] in the two goats the blood of the first
[1:01:47] goat was sprinkled on the ark ritually
[1:01:49] appeasing the wrath of god for another
[1:01:51] year
[1:01:52] now what did the second goat do they had
[1:01:54] to have a second goat because
[1:01:56] christ just christ died and took away
[1:01:57] all the sins of the world right
[1:02:00] but there has to be a daily atonement
[1:02:01] still even us remember brother brown
[1:02:03] says the world is covered in the blood
[1:02:06] of jesus christ and god can hear us
[1:02:08] through the blood even as christians
[1:02:10] right
[1:02:11] the second goat removed the sins of the
[1:02:13] people into the wilderness well they
[1:02:14] were forgotten
[1:02:17] that person whoever led that goat into
[1:02:20] the wilderness had to take it so far
[1:02:22] away
[1:02:23] that he couldn't make his way back
[1:02:27] what a job
[1:02:30] the second goat removed the sins of the
[1:02:31] people into the wilderness where they
[1:02:33] were forgotten and no longer clung to
[1:02:35] the people
[1:02:37] sin is both you know what about an
[1:02:39] israelite in that day you had no way to
[1:02:41] clean yourself you could wash in water
[1:02:43] or tons of water if you were an adult or
[1:02:45] you were still an adulterer
[1:02:47] you could wash yourself in holy water
[1:02:49] whatever you want to do
[1:02:51] but
[1:02:52] me as a person as a devout israelite
[1:02:56] i'm standing there at the door of the
[1:02:58] temple when that guy leaves that goat
[1:03:00] leads the goat out with the blood all
[1:03:02] over him
[1:03:04] and as he's leading him out if i'm a
[1:03:06] devout christian
[1:03:08] or israelite of the day
[1:03:11] what a day of atonement
[1:03:13] knowing that my sin whatever it was
[1:03:18] in symbolics now this is just in
[1:03:19] symbolics
[1:03:22] what about now with the blood of jesus
[1:03:24] christ taken away and eradicating sin
[1:03:26] but i'm standing there you know talk
[1:03:28] about a joyous time
[1:03:32] because i'm believing
[1:03:34] my high priest
[1:03:36] has done his job inside that holy of
[1:03:38] holies
[1:03:40] and that blood that's on that goat there
[1:03:42] had to be a goat dye
[1:03:44] to put that blood on that goat
[1:03:46] and then that man and you just keep seed
[1:03:49] until he just he disappears over the
[1:03:51] horizon
[1:03:52] there goes my sin
[1:03:56] i don't have to deal with that that sin
[1:03:58] no more
[1:04:00] but what about god though because there
[1:04:03] could be a chance that that goat might
[1:04:05] find his way back into the into the
[1:04:07] congregation
[1:04:09] but not with jesus christ
[1:04:11] he said as far as the east east to west
[1:04:13] there is no pole from east to west as
[1:04:16] far as the east is from west he said i'm
[1:04:18] not just
[1:04:20] covered your sin
[1:04:23] out there in the horizon there's a sea
[1:04:28] there's a sea of forgetfulness
[1:04:31] that that thing will never
[1:04:34] never
[1:04:35] amen in no way
[1:04:37] will it ever be brought up against you
[1:04:39] again
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:45] what that man did for us
[1:04:49] but look at the symbolics that we can
[1:04:51] see
[1:04:52] now the israelites depended on this
[1:04:55] you and i don't depend on this
[1:04:57] written word we depend on what christ
[1:04:59] has already done for us and we don't
[1:05:01] have to go through this ritual once a
[1:05:02] year we don't have to what if we just
[1:05:04] had church service once a year that's
[1:05:05] kind of what they did they had this big
[1:05:07] thing one time a year and the priest
[1:05:09] would go behind the veil and he would do
[1:05:10] all the things he would come out and he
[1:05:11] said your sins are forgiven. well man
[1:05:13] they just went off and you know the
[1:05:14] whole year they did something else went
[1:05:16] through these rituals
[1:05:19] that's why
[1:05:20] god finally said they're stinking my
[1:05:22] nostril your holy days you've all just
[1:05:24] made it a bunch of feasts you've made it
[1:05:26] just
[1:05:27] um something to you have to do not
[1:05:30] something you want to do
[1:05:32] he said but i'm coming
[1:05:34] i'm coming i'll write all this and i'll
[1:05:36] make this will be a type
[1:05:39] but everything you're doing
[1:05:41] i'm going to take it all away
[1:05:43] sin is both perpetuated and expediated
[1:05:46] god's way only by the sacrifice of
[1:05:48] christ on the cross perpetuation is the
[1:05:50] act of appeasing the wrath of god while
[1:05:53] expiation is the act of atoning for sin
[1:05:57] removing it from the sinner both
[1:05:59] together are achieved eternally by
[1:06:01] christ when he sacrificed himself on the
[1:06:03] cross he appeased god's wrath against
[1:06:05] sin taking that wrath upon himself what
[1:06:08] that scapegoat
[1:06:10] he put that sin on top of him now
[1:06:13] there's many people if you'll read some
[1:06:15] of the commentaries they they talk about
[1:06:16] that second goat being the devil there's
[1:06:18] no way that i put
[1:06:20] that he's going to do away with my sin
[1:06:23] no
[1:06:24] but have christ be that second goat that
[1:06:26] that goes off and puts it in the sea of
[1:06:28] god's forgetfulness
[1:06:30] never to be when he sacrificed himself
[1:06:32] on the cross he appeased god's wrath
[1:06:33] against sin taking that wrath upon
[1:06:35] himself since we have now been justified
[1:06:37] by his blood how much more shall we be
[1:06:39] saved from god's wrath through him
[1:06:41] romans 5 9 the removal of sin by the
[1:06:44] second goat was a living parable
[1:06:46] of the promise that god would remove our
[1:06:49] transgressions from us as far as the
[1:06:51] east is from west that he would remember
[1:06:54] them
[1:06:55] no
[1:06:56] more
[1:06:59] and jews still today celebrate the day
[1:07:01] of atonement which falls on different
[1:07:03] days each year september and october
[1:07:04] traditionally observing this holiday
[1:07:06] they have a 20 they take a 25-hour
[1:07:08] period they take a 24-hour day and add
[1:07:10] an extra day extra
[1:07:12] hour just to make sure
[1:07:16] intense prayer jews also often spend
[1:07:18] most of the day
[1:07:19] in synagogue
[1:07:21] services
[1:07:23] now let's go to
[1:07:26] leviticus
[1:07:28] 25 8 real quick
[1:07:32] 11 30.
[1:07:34] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[1:07:36] years unto thee seven times seven years
[1:07:39] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[1:07:41] the years shall be under the forty and
[1:07:42] nine years now
[1:07:44] we've been over this
[1:07:46] time and time again this disconnects in
[1:07:48] with daniel 70 weeks
[1:07:51] and it connects him with the
[1:07:53] year of jubilee which listen the year of
[1:07:55] jubilee has never been established in
[1:07:58] israel
[1:08:02] but this is what they were supposed to
[1:08:03] do
[1:08:04] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[1:08:07] jubilee to sound own
[1:08:09] the tenth day
[1:08:11] of the seventh month which is the day of
[1:08:13] atonement there's supposed to be a
[1:08:15] trumpet blow
[1:08:17] in the day of atonement and shall you
[1:08:19] make the trumpet sound throughout all
[1:08:20] your land
[1:08:22] they just didn't do that
[1:08:25] they didn't have a they didn't have a
[1:08:26] 50th year what was happening is on that
[1:08:29] 49th year
[1:08:30] on the 10th day of the 7th month
[1:08:34] which is the beginning of their year
[1:08:36] civil year
[1:08:39] this is the this is the jubilee year
[1:08:41] you're going free they never did that
[1:08:43] because that jubilee trumpet sound
[1:08:46] everything went free all debt was
[1:08:48] cleared everything went back to zero
[1:08:51] and as i've told you many times before
[1:08:52] even in many commentators
[1:08:55] they'll tell you that it was never ever
[1:08:58] ever
[1:08:58] the year of jubilee was never
[1:09:00] established in israel because
[1:09:03] a jew ain't gonna give his money up
[1:09:05] and if you owed you 50 i don't care if
[1:09:07] it's 49 years you're going to pay my 50
[1:09:10] i'm talking about natural
[1:09:12] but spiritually see we the jubilee has
[1:09:15] sounded for us
[1:09:18] we're not in a 49 anymore because the
[1:09:21] 49ers seven seven seven sevens that's
[1:09:24] time
[1:09:27] you and i are in the jubilee year we've
[1:09:30] heard that trumpet sound
[1:09:32] that's right on the day of atonement
[1:09:37] and make it sound throughout what all
[1:09:39] your land
[1:09:41] listen i'm proclaiming today i'm free
[1:09:44] when you got the baptism of the holy
[1:09:45] ghost you became the freest person on
[1:09:48] the face of the earth
[1:09:50] because let me tell you something you
[1:09:52] can talk about slavery and all that
[1:09:53] stuff you and i everyone are slave we
[1:09:55] are all in bondage unless we're in
[1:09:57] christ
[1:09:58] every person i don't care who it is you
[1:10:00] are enslaved you were i was all of you
[1:10:04] were you were enslaved by the devil
[1:10:08] but you heard a trumpet sound
[1:10:11] amen on that day of atonement you said
[1:10:13] thank you god
[1:10:15] listen how many of you really
[1:10:18] believe
[1:10:21] that god can do that
[1:10:24] how many of you really believe that god
[1:10:26] can take every sin you ever committed
[1:10:30] put it on that scapegoat and not just
[1:10:33] send it out there in the desert but push
[1:10:35] him off over in
[1:10:37] the sea of god's forgiveness never to be
[1:10:39] remembered again
[1:10:41] he can't remember what you did
[1:10:45] but you got to believe that that's right
[1:10:47] because the devil don't
[1:10:49] he shows up
[1:10:51] he shows back up and says
[1:10:54] yeah you did it here's where you did it
[1:10:56] here's the day you did it and you
[1:10:57] probably still got pictures around the
[1:10:58] house where you had on your shorts and
[1:11:00] your long hair
[1:11:05] it's a lie
[1:11:08] i don't care if you got physical
[1:11:09] pictures
[1:11:11] it's a lie
[1:11:13] devil that ain't me no more
[1:11:17] that's what you did to me
[1:11:19] but when i accept what god did for me
[1:11:22] brother brown said god took a picture of
[1:11:24] you before the foundation of the world
[1:11:27] that's the picture i'm depending on
[1:11:31] listen you can forget you can put on ten
[1:11:33] tons of stuff to make your hair look
[1:11:35] different
[1:11:38] have all kind of facelifts
[1:11:42] we still old
[1:11:44] but in god's eyes
[1:11:45] we never got past that 18 years old
[1:11:49] because i believe
[1:11:51] when my soul was redeemed and i received
[1:11:53] the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:11:55] turned me back
[1:11:56] to a young man
[1:11:58] now that thing inside of me is 18 years
[1:12:01] old
[1:12:02] it's not fit 60.
[1:12:04] it's 18 years old
[1:12:06] because i'm born in the image of him not
[1:12:08] in the image of my mom and daddy
[1:12:11] that came because of sin
[1:12:14] but it came to fulfill the glory of god
[1:12:16] because there's no redemption if we
[1:12:17] weren't didn't come that way
[1:12:19] there's no redemption if we came already
[1:12:21] eternal
[1:12:23] we came lost we came dead
[1:12:28] joke says all that i do not took a
[1:12:29] breath
[1:12:31] he realized that i was born in sin david
[1:12:34] said shaping an iniquity
[1:12:37] man had 500 wives he ought to know what
[1:12:38] he's talking about
[1:12:42] boarding sin shaping and iniquity spouse
[1:12:44] in my mother's womb a liar
[1:12:48] doomed and on my way
[1:12:51] to hell
[1:12:52] not in hell on my way to hell
[1:12:54] but something happened
[1:12:58] there was an exodus day
[1:13:01] there was a day that god said you're
[1:13:05] getting ready to leave egypt
[1:13:07] that's right
[1:13:08] the passover lamb was killed for you 2
[1:13:10] 000 years ago
[1:13:12] all you got to do is accept it
[1:13:14] all you got to do is is come to my feast
[1:13:17] of unleavened bread where you getting
[1:13:19] out the
[1:13:20] line and the
[1:13:22] bad temper and all the
[1:13:28] come on people you say i got born again
[1:13:29] i know i'm born again because i don't
[1:13:31] have a temper anymore i don't mean
[1:13:32] nothing
[1:13:34] i don't mean nothing
[1:13:37] why is that temperance up there for
[1:13:38] that's right
[1:13:42] that's why i'm telling you one more time
[1:13:44] and i'm going to shout this again
[1:13:45] sanctification is a good place to be but
[1:13:48] it's the worst place to stay
[1:13:50] you understand what i'm saying it's a
[1:13:52] good place to be
[1:13:53] worse place to stay
[1:13:56] because then the devil come back with
[1:13:57] his other seven amps and they'll say oh
[1:14:00] you beli
[1:14:01] you press play don't you
[1:14:03] you read quotes yeah but you live like
[1:14:05] the devil
[1:14:08] remember your life
[1:14:12] is ten times
[1:14:14] more loud
[1:14:16] than your trumpet
[1:14:22] day of atonement
[1:14:24] to realize
[1:14:26] truly realize that god almighty
[1:14:29] in human flesh
[1:14:31] died for you
[1:14:35] you can't get over that
[1:14:37] brother brown said you can't forget
[1:14:38] calvary if you're a christian there's no
[1:14:40] way you can forget calvary we can talk
[1:14:41] about seals and plagues and vials and
[1:14:42] all these different things but if you
[1:14:44] forget calvary then you're done
[1:14:47] to me the seven seals turns me to
[1:14:49] calvary
[1:14:50] shows me what that man did
[1:14:53] what he redeemed and how he did it what
[1:14:56] we're doing here and where we're going
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:59] you love the lord
[1:15:02] all right let's read all right we're
[1:15:04] finished with that
[1:15:05] let's go to romans five this is the only
[1:15:07] time in in the book in the new testament
[1:15:11] but it's referring back to the old
[1:15:13] testament says much more then being now
[1:15:14] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[1:15:16] from wrath through him
[1:15:18] for if when we were enemies we were
[1:15:20] reconciled to god by the death of his
[1:15:23] son much more
[1:15:26] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[1:15:28] his life
[1:15:31] many people know jesus died on a cross
[1:15:36] a drunk can tell you that you believe
[1:15:38] jesus is the savior of the world a
[1:15:40] prostitute can tell you that
[1:15:43] that's why brother brown says it says
[1:15:44] talks about some people can't get christ
[1:15:47] off the cross oh he died for me two
[1:15:48] thousand years ago and they see him
[1:15:50] hanging up there i like the empty one
[1:15:54] i like these empty ones
[1:15:56] even the two thieves because they went
[1:15:57] somewhere but i believe that that
[1:15:59] thing's empty the same way as the tomb
[1:16:02] the tomb is empty
[1:16:04] for if we when we were enemies we were
[1:16:06] reconciled by god by the death of his
[1:16:07] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:16:10] be saved by his life and not only so but
[1:16:12] we also joy in god through our lord
[1:16:15] jesus christ by whom we now have now
[1:16:17] received the atonement one time
[1:16:21] not every year
[1:16:23] but you and i as a christian should be
[1:16:24] in a perpetual atonement
[1:16:27] every day should be an atonement for us
[1:16:29] to realize
[1:16:31] what god did for us so let's read a
[1:16:34] couple of quotes let's go to making away
[1:16:37] 1956.
[1:16:39] then we'll get to the part on daniel 70
[1:16:41] weeks make it away we find out on the
[1:16:43] day of atonement
[1:16:45] god in time foreshadowing what he would
[1:16:47] do in the antitype when he came which
[1:16:49] was christ the high priest would
[1:16:52] was commanded to take two goats little
[1:16:54] goats take them in for atonement an
[1:16:57] offering and a bullock for his own
[1:16:59] family
[1:17:00] and many of you read us here in studies
[1:17:01] of the bible know
[1:17:03] now just how that the atonement was but
[1:17:06] then one goat there had to be a lot cast
[1:17:09] a lot fell on one goat it died
[1:17:12] then the blood of this goat was placed
[1:17:14] upon the other goat with the hands of
[1:17:16] the high priest confessing the sins of
[1:17:18] the people upon the living goat and then
[1:17:21] a man who was worthy
[1:17:23] couldn't be just somebody that walks out
[1:17:25] there about halfway out in the field and
[1:17:27] goes
[1:17:28] shugo no
[1:17:30] got to take it far away
[1:17:32] a man who was worthy taken the living
[1:17:34] goat under his arm and went way out into
[1:17:36] the wilderness where the goat would have
[1:17:38] to perish and go into an isolated out of
[1:17:41] the way place never no more in that
[1:17:43] state to come back into the family of
[1:17:45] his own again but to be isolated forever
[1:17:48] bearing the sins of the people away now
[1:17:50] i know many scholars perhaps are sitting
[1:17:52] here and especially adventists they say
[1:17:53] that one goat was christ and the other
[1:17:55] was the devil now brethren i have to
[1:17:57] differ a little bit on that
[1:17:59] we can't sacrifice to the devil
[1:18:02] okay
[1:18:03] pre-plane
[1:18:04] that one sentence proves it all
[1:18:06] but watch
[1:18:08] both goats represented christ both of
[1:18:10] them was christ christ is or he bled for
[1:18:13] our sins and he bore them himself away
[1:18:16] devil can't bear my sins christ is our
[1:18:19] sin bearer get it straight then your
[1:18:21] faith won't move christ is our sin
[1:18:24] bearer and the sins of the world christ
[1:18:27] was the dying animal on the cross the
[1:18:28] lamb slain from the foundation
[1:18:32] of the world now let's get into this
[1:18:33] real quick because i want to
[1:18:35] i want to bring the chart back up when
[1:18:37] we get finished with this because this
[1:18:39] is this is now let's switch gears you
[1:18:42] and i
[1:18:43] this is in the six-fold purpose of
[1:18:45] gabriel's visit now what's the six-fold
[1:18:46] purpose
[1:18:47] is god is going to take this six-fold
[1:18:50] purpose and redeem who israel not us
[1:18:53] israel everybody got that say amen
[1:18:55] just a few more minutes
[1:18:58] a six-fold purpose
[1:19:00] and this is in zechariah i wanted i was
[1:19:02] going to read zechariah and i come
[1:19:03] across this quote i'm going to let the
[1:19:05] prophet read it to you and let him
[1:19:07] explain what's going on
[1:19:08] oh we got to stop here just a minute now
[1:19:10] look we've left the earth
[1:19:12] because remember the daniel seven of
[1:19:14] weeks is not to the to
[1:19:16] the gentiles just to the jews right
[1:19:18] everybody got that say ma'am
[1:19:19] okay all right 70 weeks of daniel and to
[1:19:22] finish the 70 weeks of daniel there's
[1:19:24] got to be a six-fold purpose because
[1:19:26] daniel 70 weeks is not to redeem us
[1:19:29] it's to redeem the jews that's right
[1:19:31] everybody got that pretty simple we're
[1:19:33] gone we're already gone we're already in
[1:19:35] the glory we've already heard our gospel
[1:19:37] trumpet

[1:19:41] all had a body change according to
[1:19:43] thessalonians and corinthians and we
[1:19:45] have went into another dimension
[1:19:48] away from this world because this world
[1:19:50] is fixing to get plagued they've got the
[1:19:52] sixth seal coming up they got the two
[1:19:54] prophets they got the seven trumpets the
[1:19:56] vials all these different plagues
[1:19:59] i'm telling you again thank god the
[1:20:01] revelation that you and i don't have to
[1:20:03] go through that because most
[1:20:05] christian world out there believes we've
[1:20:07] got to go through those
[1:20:10] no
[1:20:11] we're out of here
[1:20:13] now the foolish virgin
[1:20:15] the sinner
[1:20:16] and part of the jews they got to go
[1:20:18] through it why for cleansing
[1:20:20] you and i have already been listen
[1:20:22] they're they're they're pulling their
[1:20:24] goat back
[1:20:27] everybody understand what i'm saying
[1:20:30] see they we don't we got a free goat
[1:20:32] that just goes
[1:20:34] to the sea of god forgetfulness
[1:20:36] and all they're doing is yeah they're
[1:20:37] fishing in the wrong sea right thank you
[1:20:39] brother boy they're fishing in the sea
[1:20:40] of god's forgetfulness that's what
[1:20:42] rumors and all are but they're wanting
[1:20:44] to pull him back and go through a
[1:20:45] tribulation period no please let it go
[1:20:50] our trumpet gives us 100
[1:20:53] deliverance amen oh we got to stop here

[1:20:59] turn with me now to the book of
[1:21:00] zechariah the 12th chapter of zechariah
[1:21:02] maybe i'm taking a little too much time
[1:21:04] starting to preach on this but i hope
[1:21:05] not i want you to get it so bad
[1:21:07] zechariah let's get the 12th chapter of
[1:21:09] zechariah and see what it's going to say
[1:21:11] now when we stand before his brethren
[1:21:13] when he stands before his brethren now
[1:21:15] this is the scene is we've left the two
[1:21:18] witnesses and i'm going to tell you a
[1:21:19] little story about that and it's really
[1:21:20] exciting brother claude told me about it
[1:21:22] last night and i finally found it
[1:21:23] the two witnesses are over there and
[1:21:25] they have declared
[1:21:29] that their messiah had already been
[1:21:30] killed and it's not come he's not coming
[1:21:32] he's already died
[1:21:33] all right so now

[1:21:40] the siege of jerusalem the beasts and
[1:21:43] the armies is took away and so forth all
[1:21:46] things are become to the end now this is
[1:21:48] almost to the millennium fixing to start
[1:21:51] the millennium

[1:21:54] fold purpose is redeeming israel and
[1:21:57] redeeming the city so you got three
[1:21:59] end of sin reconciliation for iniquity
[1:22:02] and then bringing everlasting
[1:22:03] righteousness seal up to vision and
[1:22:04] prophecy north the most holy boy
[1:22:06] sometimes i get them all mixed up but
[1:22:08] thank god we're right here toward the
[1:22:09] end he's getting ready to what and i
[1:22:12] will pour upon this is the scripture and
[1:22:13] i will pour upon the house of david

[1:22:19] spirit of what grace

[1:22:25] daniel's holy city remember is to
[1:22:27] restore the people and the city
[1:22:31] pay attention watch the spirit of grace
[1:22:33] and the supplication and they shall look
[1:22:35] upon me
[1:22:36] whom they have pierced now jesus is not
[1:22:38] standing there
[1:22:41] but they hear the voice as the sound of
[1:22:43] a trumpet like john did they didn't turn
[1:22:45] to see a bride they turned to see christ
[1:22:50] they shall look upon me whom they have
[1:22:52] pierced
[1:22:53] and they shall mourn for him
[1:22:56] as one what afflict their soul on the
[1:22:58] day of atonement
[1:23:00] as one mourneth for his only son and
[1:23:02] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[1:23:04] that is bitterness for his firstborn
[1:23:06] listen what a morning they'll be not not
[1:23:10] early morning but mourn what a morning
[1:23:12] there will be when he stands there
[1:23:14] making himself known to them like joseph
[1:23:16] did
[1:23:17] what the two prophets through the two
[1:23:18] prophets and in that day shall there be
[1:23:21] such great morning in jerusalem as the
[1:23:23] morning of
[1:23:24] hadadorima in armageddon and in the land
[1:23:28] shall be mourning every family apart
[1:23:32] what i just say
[1:23:33] the day of atone the natural day of
[1:23:35] atonement you afflict your soul you
[1:23:37] separate yourself from your wife you
[1:23:38] separate from your children you separate
[1:23:40] from your job you separate from your
[1:23:42] eating all right
[1:23:44] and then the land shall be mourning
[1:23:46] every family apart the family of the
[1:23:48] house of david departed and their wives
[1:23:50] apart and the family of the house of
[1:23:52] nathan department their family is a part
[1:23:53] of the house of levi their wives and
[1:23:55] families apart and simeon and theirs
[1:23:57] apart all the families that remain every
[1:23:58] family and their wives apart they'll be
[1:24:01] so ashamed of their self when they stand
[1:24:03] there and see that that very one that
[1:24:05] they crucified in the night
[1:24:07] standing there their own precious joseph
[1:24:10] there'll be such a mourning they'll say
[1:24:11] where did you get those scars
[1:24:15] those two prophets are going to preach
[1:24:16] so real jesus christ
[1:24:19] just like
[1:24:21] you realize
[1:24:23] christ died for you
[1:24:24] you didn't see the scars but you realize
[1:24:26] they're there
[1:24:28] okay you didn't physically see jesus
[1:24:31] but through the preaching of the gospel
[1:24:33] christ became so real
[1:24:35] to us that we accepted him in our heart
[1:24:37] we accepted what he did at calvary
[1:24:39] he said where in the house of my friends
[1:24:43] see what i mean to make an end of sin of
[1:24:45] unbelief that's what he's coming
[1:24:48] for
[1:24:51] now i didn't understand this
[1:24:54] until brother claude made this clear to
[1:24:56] me
[1:24:59] now
[1:25:00] go back to the to the chart please just
[1:25:03] for a second we'll be done musicians get
[1:25:04] ready to come
[1:25:07] okay we're right here
[1:25:10] you and i have took a rapture we're gone
[1:25:14] but the two witnesses come back and they
[1:25:16] preach what christ remember i said
[1:25:18] christ fulfilled all these right
[1:25:21] but they missed it the jews don't
[1:25:23] believe any of this happened right the
[1:25:25] nominal jew the orthodox jew they're
[1:25:28] looking for their messiah they're
[1:25:30] looking for their messiah to come
[1:25:33] we've already seen it we've been
[1:25:35] raptured so take us out of the picture
[1:25:37] but two prophets come on the scene
[1:25:40] and literally on this day of atonement
[1:25:42] listen to what happens
[1:25:49] you've got the da you got the sounding
[1:25:50] of trumpets and then that day is silent
[1:25:52] all but one time
[1:25:56] once in the morning
[1:25:58] and once in the evening
[1:26:01] there's two
[1:26:02] special
[1:26:04] silver
[1:26:05] trumpets
[1:26:07] made out of the same material
[1:26:11] sound in the morning
[1:26:13] and sound in the evening
[1:26:16] two prophets to israel
[1:26:18] two special silver trumpets
[1:26:22] the two witnesses sound
[1:26:24] on that day of atonement
[1:26:27] and it tells them what happened and they
[1:26:29] go all the way back and said where did
[1:26:30] you get those cars he said
[1:26:33] in the house of my friends this is where
[1:26:36] they crucified jesus christ right here
[1:26:38] the two trumpets two trumpets literally
[1:26:41] the shofar is sounded shorter there's a
[1:26:43] shofar sound shorter and two special
[1:26:46] silver trumpets announce the sacrifice
[1:26:50] oh hallelujah about about throwing my
[1:26:52] phone out in the yard when claude was we
[1:26:54] were talking about that
[1:26:55] but there's god you there's nothing said
[1:26:58] about trumpets in the bible but if you
[1:27:00] read
[1:27:01] uh look up shofar
[1:27:03] s-h-o-f-a-r and you'll get this very
[1:27:05] quote right here when the trumpet sound
[1:27:07] the signal all the people
[1:27:10] who were within the sacrifice
[1:27:13] prostrate themself
[1:27:16] stretching out flat face down
[1:27:19] on the ground
[1:27:20] where did you get those scars and he'll
[1:27:22] say in the house of my friends and
[1:27:24] they're gonna mourn and weep and say we
[1:27:27] just like when they told joseph they
[1:27:29] said oh we remember joseph's brothers
[1:27:32] all said oh man he's still alive
[1:27:35] we we thought we killed him remember
[1:27:36] they throwed him in the pit joseph in
[1:27:38] the pit joseph said oh don't worry
[1:27:41] it was done to preserve
[1:27:44] life
[1:27:46] you two witnesses come on the scene
[1:27:48] right here to tell israel
[1:27:51] not that christ has got to come and die
[1:27:53] again
[1:27:54] but on that day of atonement those two
[1:27:56] silver trumpets for three and a half
[1:27:58] years they're going to stand there
[1:28:00] morning and evening
[1:28:02] and they're going to declare
[1:28:04] the day of atonement
[1:28:06] and then what's going to happen with 144
[1:28:09] 000
[1:28:10] they're going next right
[1:28:13] god's going to give them the baptism of
[1:28:15] the holy ghost
[1:28:16] and then they're going to exit the
[1:28:18] building just like we did
[1:28:20] but two trumpets why two
[1:28:23] why two special trumpets that are silver
[1:28:25] not gold because we're gold silver
[1:28:28] trumpets made out of the same material
[1:28:31] moses and elijah
[1:28:33] because they preach the same message
[1:28:37] oh thank god
[1:28:39] magicians come
[1:28:48] day of atonement
[1:28:52] if you're a christian you've been
[1:28:53] through the day of atonement
[1:28:55] if you haven't you sure need to
[1:29:01] try it sometime
[1:29:04] have a fast fast for a few days fast for
[1:29:06] a day fast for three days

[1:29:11] normally wouldn't do without
[1:29:14] and see and do it for the lord don't do
[1:29:16] it for everybody around don't sound the
[1:29:17] trumpet jesus said he said don't sound
[1:29:19] your trumpet and say
[1:29:20] i'm better than that guy over there i

[1:29:24] tithes remember jesus told him he said
[1:29:27] you worse off
[1:29:29] than that woman that gave all
[1:29:31] right so let's don't sound our own
[1:29:33] trumpet we're not here sounding if i
[1:29:35] sound my own trumpet you don't listen to
[1:29:38] it
[1:29:40] but if god sounds that trumpet
[1:29:43] and it gives a certain sound
