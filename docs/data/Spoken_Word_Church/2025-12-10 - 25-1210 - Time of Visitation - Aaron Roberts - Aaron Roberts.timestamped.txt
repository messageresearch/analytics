[0:02] When I wake up in the morning and when I
[0:07] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.
[0:16] I am blessed
[0:20] through the sun shine and rain.
[0:25] Even sorrow
[0:27] and pain,
[0:29] Jesus still
[0:32] is my comfort
[0:35] guide.
[0:39] And his love comforts me.
[0:43] And his grace has set me free.
[0:48] And someday
[0:50] I shall stand by his side.
[0:55] Oh, what a glorious thing. I am blessed.
[1:02] I am blessed
[1:06] every day that I live.

[1:21] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.
[1:29] I am blessed.
[1:34] I have shoes for my feet.
[1:38] I've got plenty
[1:41] to eat and a home
[1:46] in heaven. I am my
[1:52] brothers and sisters on this earth. They
[1:57] are my my new birth. And someday
[2:04] we shall stand
[2:06] by
[2:10] hopeless.
[2:15] I am blessed.
[2:20] Every day
[2:24] I am blessed.
[2:29] When I wake up in the morning and when I
[2:35] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.

[2:45] more time. I have shoes. I have shoes
[2:50] for my feet.

[3:48] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.
[3:57] I am blessed.
[4:04] Wonderful thing it is to know that we
[4:06] are kept by the Lord Jesus.
[4:09] And you are here because he's kept you
[4:12] all this time.
[4:15] Some of us a little longer than others,
[4:18] but he still kept you. And if he wanted
[4:21] you to go, whatever time, that dangerous
[4:25] moment that you had,
[4:27] you would have gone right there and
[4:29] then. But there's a plan for you to
[4:32] fulfill. And you're not going to go
[4:34] anywhere until you fulfill that plan.
[4:36] Amen. So, I'm so thankful that he has
[4:40] everything under control.
[4:44] All things work together for good to
[4:47] them that love God, right? And I believe
[4:50] that we all love him here. Amen. Praise
[4:52] the Lord Jesus. Brother Thomas, do you
[4:55] want to help us take up our offering?
[5:06] Thank you for blessings.
[5:21] Amen. As he passes that around, let's
[5:22] sing. The more that I surrender, the
[5:25] lighter my load.
[5:27] The more that I release my cares,
[5:30] the more he takes control.
[5:33] How many have felt that way before? So
[5:35] that when you just can't take it
[5:37] anymore. Amen. He said cast our burdens
[5:40] upon him for he makes him light.
[5:45] Actually, he takes them. And so if we
[5:48] just cast everything upon him. Amen.
[5:50] Because he cares for us.
[6:04] The more that I surrender,
[6:09] the lighter
[6:12] my Lord.
[6:15] The more that I release my cares,
[6:20] the more you take control.
[6:26] The more that I can humble myself,
[6:31] the more you lift me up.
[6:35] And every day I live. Lord, I love you
[6:42] more. Sing that once again. The more
[6:45] that I surrender. Oh, the more that I
[6:50] surrender,
[6:53] the lighter
[6:55] my Lord.

[7:04] more you take control.
[7:09] The more that I can humble myself,
[7:15] the more you lift me up. And every day I
[7:21] live.
[7:23] Lord, I love you more. And it gets
[7:27] easier to understand.
[7:30] Oh, and it gets easier
[7:33] to understand.
[7:36] It's wrong. Traveling down
[7:40] for no wing
[7:44] or wondering
[7:47] standing on solid ground.
[7:52] And I know I'm headed to my future home.
[7:57] And the voice I hear is yours alone.

[8:59] had. One yesterday

[9:29] Every day I live,
[9:33] Lord, I love you more.
[9:38] The more that I surrender, the more that
[9:42] I surrender,
[9:46] lighter
[9:48] my Lord,
[9:51] the more that I release my gifts,
[9:57] the more you take control.
[10:02] Oh, the more that I can humble myself,
[10:08] the more you lift me up.
[10:12] And every day I live,
[10:16] Lord, I love you more. Let's sing that
[10:20] second verse again. And the problems I
[10:21] had,
[10:23] oh the problems I had on yesterday
[10:29] are a step
[10:32] to a higher place. The trials that seem
[10:37] so awesome to me.
[10:41] Now my banner of victory
[10:45] and I can go
[10:48] into it to my future home.
[10:51] The voice I hear is yours alone.
[10:56] Every day I live.

[16:37] Okay.
[16:41] What was it? Brother Wilson Henry said
[16:42] that time talking about AM.
[16:45] AM was amplitude modulation and FM means
[16:50] to follow me
[16:55] if you keep up. If not, just clap your
[16:57] hands.

[20:29] Amen. We'll practice that some more, but
[20:32] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Did you sing along?
[20:38] Yeah.
[20:39] That's an old old song.
[20:44] Praise him anyhow.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that we can tell the
[20:47] world about what Jesus done for us.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; I can tell the world about what what
[20:53] happened to me.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; You know, just not
[20:58] as I was listening to somebody the other
[21:00] day. It's like, you know, we're not
[21:03] making just accusations or or
[21:08] statements. It's like we're giving
[21:10] testimony. It's a testimony. It's
[21:12] something that we experience. We live
[21:13] through
[21:15] not what anybody else know. We can tell
[21:17] our own testimony. What our own
[21:18] experience was
[21:20] &gt;&gt; and we know we know what happened to us.
[21:22] If you know what happened to you, you
[21:23] you know what you went through, where
[21:25] you came from to where you are today.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad that we know what
[21:29] Jesus done for me.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; And you can say the same thing for you
[21:34] that you know what God where God brought
[21:36] you from.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Took me out of the miry clay of the
[21:40] world. the sin of the world
[21:41] &gt;&gt; and set me on a rock,
[21:43] &gt;&gt; a firm foundation.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing at.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; And praise God that it ain't me that's
[21:53] holding me.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; It's him holding.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; You know, they asked brother Brandon
[21:59] about that time like, you know, when you
[22:01] went lost your wife and your daughter
[22:03] and all the things you've happened in
[22:04] your life, you know, did you keep your
[22:06] religion? He said, no, he kept me.
[22:10] I can't keep myself,
[22:12] &gt;&gt; but he does. He keeps us.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[22:17] let's we'll look into the book of
[22:19] Jeremiah,
[22:21] chapter 10.
[22:29] We're going to begin at verse 10.
[22:32] Read very familiar scripture, which I
[22:34] believe all of it should be familiar to
[22:37] us.
[22:39] and just look at a few things tonight.
[22:43] Jeremiah chapter 10, begin at verse 10.
[22:46] And uh I want to look at title this a
[22:51] time of visitation. And in the book of
[22:53] Jeremiah when you look Jeremiah talks
[22:56] about a a time of visitation. And he
[22:59] talks about an hour of visitation
[23:02] and uh some of the other minor pro other
[23:05] minor prophets Hosea and different ones
[23:07] they talk about this time of visitation
[23:11] and you know you you see this comes up
[23:14] even Jesus we'll read here a little bit
[23:17] you know even Jesus talks about there
[23:19] was a time of visitation to in Jerusalem
[23:22] to the children to Israel you know and
[23:25] they missed their hour of visitation.
[23:29] And we see that, you know, today is the
[23:31] same thing that's happening
[23:33] &gt;&gt; that we live in a day that people don't
[23:35] see the hour.
[23:38] But God is speaking to each one.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And you know, God speaks to you where
[23:43] you're where you're at.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; He knows where what you're where you're
[23:47] at in your journey. And God comes and
[23:49] speaks to you. And you know, he doesn't
[23:53] speak to all of us the same because
[23:54] we're not all at the same place. But you
[23:56] know, God knows what you need
[23:58] &gt;&gt; and he comes and speaks to you and
[24:00] &gt;&gt; and opens things to you and and it's
[24:03] whether you want to accept those things
[24:05] or not and you want to walk with God in
[24:08] a in a greater way or in a further walk,
[24:11] but you know, he's a gentleman, but he,
[24:13] you know, you can't say that he hadn't
[24:15] offered it to you.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Salvation is is of the Lord and he
[24:20] offers it and you know, then you have to
[24:22] decide whether you want to accept it or
[24:24] not.
[24:26] But I'm so glad it's a free gift. And
[24:27] all we have to do is accept it.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's not anything where
[24:31] people always talk about trying to get
[24:32] good enough to do something. You don't
[24:34] ever have to get good enough to do
[24:36] something to accept God's favor or God's
[24:40] forgiveness.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you will just
[24:46] accept it and you just yield yourself to
[24:49] it, then God will do a work.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's so wonderful. Realize
[24:55] that you just give it to him.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just all bow our heads.
[25:00] We'll read the scripture. Heavenly
[25:01] Father, we thank you for this tonight,
[25:02] Lord Jesus. We thank you for all those
[25:04] that have come in your house, Lord
[25:07] Jesus. We thank you for this time, Lord,
[25:09] that we can gather around your word. We
[25:11] just pray that you bless each one that's
[25:13] here, Lord, that's made an effort. And
[25:15] we know there's many that are tired in
[25:16] their bodies, Lord, may be sick,
[25:18] whatever the situation is. Lord, we just
[25:20] pray that you just come and touch them.
[25:22] And Lord, those that couldn't be with us
[25:23] tonight, whatever the need is, Lord, we
[25:25] just pray that you be with them and
[25:26] touch them. Lord, those that are
[25:28] watching in now and later, Lord, we just
[25:31] pray that you be with them and touch
[25:33] them, Lord, give them what they have
[25:34] need of. And Father, just bless the word
[25:37] as we read it tonight. And Lord, just
[25:39] help us get ourselves out of the way and
[25:40] that you may be able to speak to us. And
[25:43] Lord Jesus, we we find something that it
[25:46] in this scripture tonight, Lord, in the
[25:48] word that Lord, that we can grab a hold
[25:50] of, Lord, that that will feed our souls,
[25:52] Lord, that will anchor us, Lord Jesus.
[25:54] That will be an encouragement to us,
[25:56] Lord. That when we go and go into these
[25:58] battles and this journey, Lord Jesus, we
[26:00] have something to that will sustain us,
[26:03] Lord Jesus, that'll carry us, Lord,
[26:05] that'll keep us, Lord. But we just
[26:08] commit ourselves into your hands, Lord.
[26:11] We just thank you for all your blessings
[26:13] on us, Lord. We can't can't thank you
[26:15] enough, Lord, for all things. We just
[26:19] yield ourselves to you at this time in
[26:22] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:25] Amen. Jeremiah chapter 10 and beginning
[26:28] at verse 10.
[26:30] And it says, "But the Lord is the true
[26:33] God. He is the living God and an
[26:36] everlasting king. At his wrath the earth
[26:39] shall tremble and the nations shall not
[26:42] be able to abide his indignation.
[26:45] Thus thus shall ye say unto them, the
[26:48] gods that have not made the heavens and
[26:51] the earth, even they shall perish from
[26:53] the earth and from under these heavens.
[26:59] God made the earth by his power. He
[27:02] established the world by his wisdom and
[27:04] by his understanding and skill stretched
[27:06] out the heavens.
[27:10] And it says when he uttered his voice,
[27:12] there is a multitude of waters in
[27:14] heavens and he causes the vapors to
[27:16] ascend from the ends of the earth. He
[27:18] maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth
[27:20] forth the wind out of his treasures.
[27:23] Every man is brutish in his knowledge.
[27:26] Every founder is confounded by the
[27:27] graven image. for his molten image is
[27:30] falsehood and there is no breath in
[27:32] them. They are vanity and the works of
[27:35] error in the time of their visitation
[27:38] they shall perish. Amen. God bless you.
[27:41] You may be seated tonight.
[27:44] And you know here in the here in the
[27:46] book of Jeremiah
[27:50] um you know this scripture this
[27:52] scripture is is known for for one uh
[27:56] this time of year. A lot of people like
[27:57] to quote this chapter 10 gets gets read
[28:01] a lot. Um
[28:03] and uh I uh have tell a story. I worked
[28:08] with a man years ago and uh I didn't
[28:11] know I didn't know the man believed
[28:12] anything. I know well I knew that he
[28:15] believed in God but he didn't believe in
[28:16] organized religion. He didn't believe in
[28:18] a whole lot of things. U he didn't trust
[28:20] corporations.
[28:22] Um he didn't trust governments. There
[28:24] was a whole there was a whole lot of
[28:26] things that he didn't he didn't agree
[28:27] with and uh he and
[28:31] he uh was a little bit of a um a
[28:35] contentious person and uh he just kind
[28:37] of told you what he thought and uh he
[28:39] liked to say things sometimes just to
[28:42] say what how people would react to what
[28:44] he had to say and um I never I never
[28:47] knew you know I talked to him some but I
[28:49] mean you know he he just didn't trust
[28:51] anybody and and if you know if If you
[28:54] didn't uh if you ever said you you know
[28:57] you promised anything, he just expected
[28:59] you know if you didn't just give it to
[29:01] him right then you know he he didn't
[29:02] trust nobody further than he could throw
[29:04] them as the old saying is but uh one day
[29:08] people were talking about Christmas and
[29:09] he come along and then he started he
[29:11] started quoting Jeremiah 10. I didn't
[29:13] even know the man could quote the
[29:15] scripture and he started quoting about
[29:17] it. He said, "Why is it why is it this
[29:19] time of year everybody goes down there,
[29:21] you know, puts up a tree and they're
[29:22] decorating it and everything like that?"
[29:24] And he was quoting the scripture and
[29:25] he's like, "How does that fit in?" He
[29:26] said, "The Bible says it's a heathen
[29:28] thing." And and he was going on and I
[29:30] was like, "Darl, I didn't even know you
[29:32] knew the Bible.
[29:34] I never knew that you knew anything
[29:35] about the Bible."
[29:37] Uh but you know it was always something
[29:39] that you know people always say those
[29:40] things that they they bring these things
[29:42] out but it was always interesting how
[29:45] you know it was something that was
[29:46] always this contentious thing but you
[29:48] know here in the in the book of of
[29:50] Jeremiah in chapter 10
[29:53] that when you started here in the in the
[29:56] beginning of the chapter we just we'll
[29:57] just read the first five verses here and
[30:00] it says
[30:02] Jeremiah chapter 1 it says hear ye the
[30:04] word which the Lord spake taketh unto
[30:06] you, oh house of Israel, thus sayeth the
[30:09] Lord, he said, learn not the way of the
[30:11] heathen, and be not dismayed by the
[30:13] signs of heaven, for the heathen are
[30:15] dismayed at them. You know, Brother
[30:17] Brandon talks about that, you know,
[30:18] because one of the times when brother
[30:20] Brandon was talking about that
[30:21] scripture, he's talking about the uh
[30:23] investigating angels, judgment coming in
[30:26] even in our day where where they're
[30:28] seeing those things. He said, "Because
[30:29] the heathen are dismayed by them." But
[30:32] the scripture tells us to look up
[30:34] &gt;&gt; because the things that take place in
[30:36] the heavens are signs unto us just like
[30:38] it was unto Israel that the those were
[30:40] signs to us to see the day and hour in
[30:42] which we live. He said for the customs
[30:44] of the people are vain for one cutth
[30:47] tree out of the forest the work of the
[30:49] hands of the workman with the axe. He
[30:50] said they deck it with silver and with
[30:52] gold. They fasten it with nails with
[30:54] hammers that it move not. They are
[30:56] upright as the palm tree but speak not.
[30:58] They must be born because they cannot
[31:01] go. Be not afraid of them. For they
[31:03] cannot do evil, neither also is in them
[31:07] to do good.
[31:09] So we understand that when you when you
[31:12] go to the scripture and there's multiple
[31:15] places in the book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah
[31:17] is rebuking. He rebukes more than one,
[31:19] but he rebukes Israel for one thing
[31:22] because of their idolatry. And this is
[31:25] the one scripture where he goes to and
[31:27] what he's talking about is they're
[31:30] carving out their own gods. They're
[31:32] making their own gods. And he said, "You
[31:35] go out in the wood and you cut this
[31:37] thing down and you make your own idol."
[31:40] But this idol can't do anything for you.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; And so that's the reason when we read
[31:44] the scripture, he said, "You have to
[31:46] fasten it." But he said, "It can't do
[31:47] evil. It can't speak to you. It can't do
[31:49] good or evil. There's no power in this
[31:52] thing." And then and then the scripture
[31:54] we were reading earlier, the the first
[31:56] passage there, see it talks about the
[31:59] God of heaven created all these things
[32:01] and all of your gods can't do any of
[32:03] this.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; There's no power in your God. So here
[32:07] you are when you're looking at this,
[32:08] he's talking about their idols, their
[32:11] idolatry, and really it goes back to
[32:14] their beliefs but really to their
[32:16] unbelief because they do not believe
[32:18] what they've seen because God spoke to
[32:20] them. God done things before them to
[32:22] show him his power and they refused it
[32:26] &gt;&gt; and they created their own their own
[32:29] idol, their own doctrine, their own
[32:31] creeds and they held to them
[32:35] &gt;&gt; and they built and they built their
[32:37] their great uh temples or or whatever
[32:40] and they set up these things in front of
[32:41] the people to look at but in reality
[32:45] there's no truth in them at all.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; There's no power in those. And the
[32:50] reason is when God begins to speak to
[32:52] them to try to show them, all they do is
[32:54] look at their idol
[32:56] &gt;&gt; and they're missing the whole plan of
[32:57] God because they're looking at an idol.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; And so they've miss they miss the whole
[33:03] plan of God and all that God is trying
[33:05] to do with them. Now when we look at the
[33:08] word the word visit the first time that
[33:10] we actually see where God comes to visit
[33:12] somebody where we see that there is a
[33:14] promise made to God coming and he's
[33:17] going to visit somebody in a time in in
[33:20] the future that it was going to take
[33:21] place is in Genesis chapter 50 and it
[33:24] talks about Joseph sees the children of
[33:26] Manasseh and Ephraim. He sees their
[33:28] descendants and he sees his great
[33:30] grandchildren and he's coming to a place
[33:32] and he's coming to the end of his life
[33:34] and he's there in in Egypt and he begins
[33:36] to speak to the children of Israel and
[33:37] he tells them listen God's going to come
[33:40] and he's going to fulfill the word that
[33:41] he gave to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and
[33:44] he said when he carries you out of this
[33:45] place because this is not the place
[33:48] where you're supposed to be. This is not
[33:49] your final destination. There is a place
[33:52] because God in the beginning he gave he
[33:55] gave our father Abraham the promise of
[33:58] going into the promised land and he said
[34:00] he gave it to Isaac and he gave it to
[34:02] Jacob and we're here only by the by the
[34:06] providence of God for sustaining of life
[34:08] and God has blessed us here but this is
[34:10] not our final destination. This is not
[34:12] our final home. And God is going to
[34:14] bring us to that place. And he's going
[34:16] to come to you and he's going to show
[34:18] you the way that's going to lead you to
[34:20] the place that God wants you to be. The
[34:22] place that God has promised to you. And
[34:24] he said he's going to take you there.
[34:25] And he told and Joseph told the children
[34:28] of Israel, he said, "You're going to
[34:29] have to make a promise to me that when
[34:31] you go out and you're going into that
[34:33] promised land, he said, "You take my
[34:35] bones out. You carry them out of this
[34:37] place." He said, he said, "Because I may
[34:38] not be able to see it, but he said,
[34:40] you're going to take my body, what's
[34:42] left of me, my bones, and you're going
[34:43] to carry them into the promised land
[34:46] &gt;&gt; because you know all this that he that
[34:48] he went through, God showed him these
[34:50] things." But he said, "I'm going to be
[34:52] in that pro promised land because when
[34:54] the Messiah comes and he fulfills all
[34:56] the scripture, he said, "My body's going
[34:57] to be there."
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Because when the when it comes a time
[35:00] when there's going to be a resurrection,
[35:02] my body's going to be in the promised
[35:03] land. Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; And he was so he was so adamant about
[35:07] that that he did not want to stay even
[35:09] though he lived and God blessed him in
[35:11] the land of Egypt. That was not the
[35:13] final resting place. That was not his
[35:14] final destination. HE WAS GOING TO GO TO
[35:17] THE PLACE that God had promised him
[35:18] because he's going to go there and he
[35:20] wants even it was just that it was just
[35:22] his bones. But praise God, he knew when
[35:24] God was coming back and there was going
[35:26] to be a resurrection, he was going to be
[35:28] in the promised land.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, that's the way
[35:31] it is with us. Because if God has given
[35:33] us a promised land, if you want to be in
[35:35] the resurrection, then we're going to
[35:36] have to get in the promised land, which
[35:38] is the word of God. Because this is the
[35:40] only place that you can be that you're
[35:42] going to come to the place THAT YOU'RE
[35:43] GOING TO COME to a resurrection. Because
[35:45] you're going to see that resurrection
[35:46] inside of you before you come to that
[35:48] place.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to see that we're already
[35:51] resurrected and sitting in heavenly
[35:53] places in Christ Jesus before we're
[35:56] going to see the dead saints come out of
[35:57] the ground. And they're going to see
[35:58] we're going to be able TO SEE WHO WE
[36:00] ARE. AND we're going to call for them to
[36:01] come to be where we are.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have received our day of
[36:11] visitation.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And you got to be steadfast in your
[36:18] belief.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; That you know where you stand.
[36:23] No matter where all the winds of
[36:25] doctrine that blow this way or that way,
[36:28] that's all right. You know where you're
[36:29] standing. Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; You know what what the word is to you
[36:32] and what God has given you.
[36:36] Just like just like the you know you go
[36:38] through the Old Testament, we see how
[36:39] God spoke to so many and give them a
[36:41] promise. And when he began to visit like
[36:44] Noah when he began to speak to him and
[36:46] tell him, listen, there's a way that's
[36:47] made for you to get out of this.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; You see all of the all the sin and
[36:52] immorality and all the things that have
[36:54] went on, but there's a place there's a
[36:55] way made. But there was something that
[36:57] Noah had to do. And the first thing Noah
[36:59] had to do was accept the word of God
[37:00] that it was that God had spoken to him
[37:03] that there was a way to make to get out.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; And God gave him a commission to do. And
[37:08] he had to take that commission. And
[37:10] whether anybody else believed it or
[37:11] anybody else did anything about it,
[37:12] there was something that he agreed with
[37:14] and said, you know what? This is my
[37:16] commission. This is what God called me
[37:17] to do. And whether nobody else goes with
[37:19] me, that's okay. But I'm going to build
[37:21] the ark.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; I'm g and you know, you go through all
[37:25] the things. You look at Moses being out
[37:27] there and all the things that he had
[37:29] went through in his life. But you know
[37:30] what? Moses had the light.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; The word of God has shined upon him. God
[37:35] opened his eyes and told him that,
[37:36] "Listen, because of what took place back
[37:39] then, there is now all of these people
[37:41] that are in the land of bondage. But you
[37:43] know what? I'm bringing these people
[37:44] out.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm It's time to come out."
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Well, here here was Joseph speaking to
[37:52] them down there. Listen, there's coming
[37:54] a time you're going to come out OF THIS
[37:55] PLACE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; This is not your home.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; When everything got where it got so
[38:03] uncomfortable, nobody wanted to be
[38:04] there. And they began to cry for a
[38:06] deliverer when the deliverer showed up
[38:08] and he was standing there in shoe
[38:10] leather speaking to them. They could not
[38:12] follow him. They could not believe what
[38:14] he was saying to them. That's right.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Instead of just stepping behind the
[38:19] prophet as he began to speak the word of
[38:21] God and take everything that the prophet
[38:23] had to say as thus sayeth the Lord and
[38:25] walk with them, they began to murmur and
[38:27] complain and want to make their own
[38:29] theology.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; They had to have their own creeds.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; But it was thus sayeth the Lord.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And the only ones that went in were the
[38:39] ones that actually followed what Moses
[38:41] told them.
[38:45] See, he said, he said, "I'm going show
[38:46] you." He said, "I'm going to take you
[38:48] out with a strong hand." He said, "I'll
[38:50] show my power in Egypt."
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to show what what I
[38:56] can do
[38:58] &gt;&gt; and show all the p all the gods and the
[39:01] deities and everything that they had in
[39:03] Egypt was powerless." Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Well, they they had because Pharaoh had
[39:10] his time and they they looked at Pharaoh
[39:12] as being a god. Well, he had his time to
[39:15] do what he was going to do. But there
[39:18] came a time when Pharaoh's reign was
[39:20] over with.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; When he when everybody thought he was
[39:25] God to the people, then all of a sudden
[39:27] he was going to become powerless.
[39:32] that everything that Moses had said
[39:36] was going to be thus sayith the Lord.
[39:38] And there was no way of changing that.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Listen," he said, "Let my
[39:43] people go."
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, we're not. We're going to follow
[39:47] my plan. You go I'm I'm I'm God down
[39:50] here. Well, there's a new God in town.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; You're God. You You're You're not in
[39:56] You're not in control anymore.
[39:58] the I am
[40:00] &gt;&gt; that I am has come
[40:02] &gt;&gt; has come down and he's beginning to
[40:04] speak to you
[40:07] &gt;&gt; and you know what you you can you can
[40:08] let all this take place or you're going
[40:10] to have the wrath of God you're going to
[40:12] face judgment
[40:15] &gt;&gt; and it's like well you can either follow
[40:17] what what he says do or it's death
[40:22] &gt;&gt; and even even to the children of Israel
[40:25] when they were down there they had to
[40:26] follow exactly what Moses said or it was
[40:28] death to them
[40:31] &gt;&gt; when it when it came time after they
[40:33] went through all of the um plagues and
[40:36] everything that went they had went
[40:37] through. Yet when they come to the time
[40:39] that they had to take the lamb and slay
[40:41] it and place the blood on the door and
[40:43] get prepared and eat the lamb and take
[40:46] and eat the unleaven bread and all those
[40:47] things and get ready because tonight is
[40:49] the Passover and now you're going out
[40:52] because now is a death sentence has
[40:54] passed by. But you know what? life has
[40:56] come to you if you accept it.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And so the thing is is the same thing.
[41:01] If you will take the lamb, the word of
[41:03] God, if you will eat the lamb and take
[41:05] the blood, the provision that's made,
[41:07] then you know what? In the midst of all
[41:08] the death and all the destruction and
[41:10] all the uncertainty, there is a way made
[41:13] that you've come out and you'll go out
[41:14] in victory.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Because they didn't know where they were
[41:17] going, but there was a ma way made and
[41:19] all they had to do was follow exactly
[41:21] what God told them to do.
[41:24] And it's the same way with you and I
[41:25] because everybody, well, what's going to
[41:27] take place next? What's going to take
[41:29] what's going to happen here? What's
[41:30] going to happen there? You know, we
[41:31] don't have to worry about those things
[41:33] because you know what? We don't have to
[41:34] worry about tomorrow because we'll worry
[41:36] about tomorrow when tomorrow gets here.
[41:38] But all we got to do is worry about
[41:39] today and what God's doing. Because if
[41:41] God is speaking unto us today, because
[41:44] today is the day of salvation. If God is
[41:46] speaking to us today, if he's speaking
[41:48] to us today, then all we got to do is
[41:49] accept what he said and then just follow
[41:52] it. And you know, then you can rest your
[41:53] soul upon that and you can you can
[41:55] rejoice in the fact that God has spoke
[41:57] to you and told you what to do.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm so glad to know where God has
[42:05] placed us to know what God has spoke to
[42:08] us to know that God has given us a
[42:10] five-fold ministry that he's given a
[42:12] ministry
[42:15] &gt;&gt; because you know we know that we we're
[42:17] thank God that we received a a a
[42:19] ministry. We received a prophet in our
[42:21] day. We we received the word, the
[42:23] opening of the word in our day. But
[42:25] praise God, he give us a a way to follow
[42:28] that.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; There there is a there is a
[42:33] a hierarchy.
[42:35] We could say that, you know. So So
[42:37] there's leadership that's made and we
[42:39] follow that. Praise God that God has
[42:41] given us one that we can follow that we
[42:44] can get behind. And you know what the
[42:45] problem is? is if you don't if you're
[42:46] not completely sold out to to that then
[42:49] you you got to go somewhere else. You
[42:50] got to you got to find where you can
[42:52] anchor your soul.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; I mean because you know somebody I
[42:58] mentioned this before and somebody was
[43:00] talking about you know things happening
[43:02] and and everything. Hey,
[43:04] we have never never never been been
[43:07] following a man.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; This this church been here since 1971.
[43:12] You know what? We ain't never followed a
[43:13] man.
[43:16] It's been the Holy Ghost.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; When when brother Mo began to speak to
[43:23] brother Dale about the word, that wasn't
[43:25] that wasn't some man was some man's
[43:27] intellectualism speaking to him. That
[43:30] was the Holy Ghost.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; But what was it that spoke to brother
[43:33] Dale all those years ago when he began
[43:36] to read the scripture and began to see
[43:38] that there had to be an end time
[43:39] prophet? Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't understand all of those
[43:43] things, but there was something there
[43:44] that began to stir inside of him that he
[43:47] began to dig into the word and he wasn't
[43:49] waiting on somebody else's idea. He
[43:51] began to read it for himself to find out
[43:53] what the scriptures said. And he began
[43:55] to look and began to pray that God would
[43:57] begin to speak to him to open the word
[44:01] &gt;&gt; because you know what? We don't all get
[44:03] around and read all and have some
[44:05] council that we have to go to and
[44:06] everybody stand around and say, "Well,
[44:08] how many people are going to vote on
[44:09] this and how many people are going to
[44:10] vote on that?"
[44:13] You know, I mean, it it's ridiculous how
[44:15] many people, you know, because they they
[44:17] just want to hold on to what whatever
[44:19] came in the past or whatever and they
[44:21] and they miss God because God begins to
[44:23] speak to them.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? If God speaks to
[44:26] you and there's a pathway for you to go,
[44:28] GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE NOT GONNA follow
[44:29] somebody else because their path is not
[44:32] your path.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God that you know what? We
[44:35] had people that were that were Baptist
[44:37] or whatever, you know, and they were
[44:38] great people and they led us to a
[44:40] certain point and now the other people
[44:41] came along and they led us to a certain
[44:43] point and then we moved on from that.
[44:44] But you know what? They may have stayed
[44:46] there, but praise God, you know what?
[44:47] God led us to a certain point. Now it's
[44:49] time for us to move on. God begins to
[44:51] open things to us and show us greater
[44:53] things that they never saw.
[44:56] But I don't I don't I don't I thank
[44:58] thank God for the people that he put in
[45:00] my pathway that begin to show me the
[45:02] ways of God. But you know what? I'm
[45:03] still not back where they are.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; They were an encouragement to me. They
[45:08] were a blessing to me. I thank God for
[45:10] all of them. But you know what? I'm not
[45:11] going to follow that
[45:13] &gt;&gt; because if God brings me to this place,
[45:14] then I'm going to follow what God
[45:16] because it's the Holy Ghost that's
[45:17] leading me. Well, if it's the Holy Ghost
[45:19] that's leading me, then I'm going to
[45:20] continue to follow the Holy Ghost.
[45:23] If it's the same as say brother Brown
[45:24] I'm talking about brother Charlie Cox
[45:26] the same one that told you to turn
[45:27] around going to take you all the way.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; He's going to call you up. It's the same
[45:32] one that started you on this journey.
[45:33] He's going to lead you all the way.
[45:35] Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I was telling brother
[45:40] Wade before church and some of y'all may
[45:42] have may have seen some of this this uh
[45:47] uh ch u Kirk Cameron about the uh
[45:52] about the uh whether where hell's
[45:54] eternal or not. And you know uh some of
[45:57] y'all probably know who Kirk Cameron is.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; You know some of us from the 80s
[46:03] remember him way back when.
[46:05] uh
[46:06] &gt;&gt; BC. That's right. Praise the Lord.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; But you know, he's uh you know, he's
[46:12] he's had a podcast and he's made movies
[46:15] and different things and you know, he
[46:17] took the time and I really appreciate
[46:19] him. I don't I mean, I don't agree with
[46:21] all of his all his stances, but the one
[46:23] thing I appreciate about him was he
[46:25] actually sat down and him and his son,
[46:27] they have a podcast, they begin reading,
[46:29] had a book somebody give to him. So he
[46:32] began to read this book and he began to
[46:34] study and and it had to do with the
[46:37] words called annihilationism. And that
[46:40] means that when you when those that are
[46:42] cast into the lake of fire there the
[46:45] term that they use is eternal
[46:48] conscious torment.
[46:51] When you go to the lake of fire you will
[46:53] be conscious eternal torment. That was
[46:57] that's the term that they use. And he
[46:59] was like, well, this man wrote about
[47:01] annihilationism saying that there's a
[47:03] period of time. And he said, this goes
[47:06] along with the character of God that
[47:07] somewhere along the way all these former
[47:09] things will be passed away. You may go
[47:11] to the lake of fire and you may go
[47:12] through this, but at some point in time,
[47:14] all this will be done away with. It's
[47:17] like because the judgment of God is
[47:20] eternal, but the punishment of God's not
[47:23] eternal.
[47:25] And so the way he was way he was
[47:27] explaining this well I mean there's
[47:29] people boy I tell you what they have
[47:31] just strung him out to dry.
[47:34] I can't believe that. And this one man
[47:37] he was writing and he was like all of
[47:39] Christendom for all these thousands of
[47:41] years we've all believed that hell's
[47:43] eternal and you're going to go to hell
[47:44] and you're going to go through this for
[47:46] eternity and this is what the church has
[47:48] always taught. you go back through and I
[47:50] was thinking, okay,
[47:54] um, this is the same this is the same
[47:56] church history, the same people that
[47:58] were in in in the past. And if we just
[48:01] want to base it on that, it's like,
[48:02] okay, well, number one, this is the same
[48:05] group of people that believe that
[48:06] magicians
[48:08] made a deal with the devil and that's
[48:10] how you could do cheap magician tricks.
[48:15] That's and it's like you know it's all
[48:16] about slight of hand and misdirection
[48:18] and all this stuff and you can go to the
[48:19] carnival and you can get books and
[48:21] reading how to learn how to do magic
[48:22] tricks but you know years ago the church
[48:24] actually believed that you made a deal
[48:26] with the devil and they were going to
[48:27] burn you or hang you or kill you because
[48:29] what you done
[48:30] &gt;&gt; now that's that's the same church now
[48:33] this is this is the same church the same
[48:36] church history that burned Jonah of arc
[48:38] at the stake for being a witch because
[48:42] they didn't agree that she could have
[48:44] that God would speak to her and show her
[48:47] visions and told her what was going to
[48:48] take place.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And this is the same church history that
[48:53] we're talking about that wouldn't
[48:54] believe in didn't believe in medical
[48:56] science.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And now all they said was everything
[49:00] everything was all all of the devil and
[49:02] it was all good and it was angels and
[49:04] everything like that. And it's like,
[49:05] yeah, but you know, we came we came a
[49:06] long way from there. Thank God for
[49:08] medicine.
[49:10] Yeah.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden, you know, like we
[49:12] had all these people dying and different
[49:13] things like and all of a sudden we
[49:14] learned, you know what? You need to cook
[49:16] your food properly. You need to wash
[49:18] your hands. If you're sick, stay away
[49:21] from people.
[49:23] Amazing how all this stuff works.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; But it's the same but it's the same but
[49:29] it's the same idea that the church
[49:31] taught.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And it's like, well, this is what the
[49:35] church has taught. Well, at some point
[49:37] in time it at sometimes you need to take
[49:39] a step back and think about what did the
[49:41] church teach us
[49:46] &gt;&gt; because it's the same church that sat
[49:47] out there and they said the only
[49:49] scripture that you can baptize is
[49:50] Matthew 28:19. That's the only scripture
[49:52] in the Bible that talks about baptism.
[49:57] And you get over in the book of Acts.
[49:58] Well, we just got to skip that whole
[49:59] chapter. We don't don't even read that
[50:03] because somebody might see that you need
[50:04] to get baptized in the name of Jesus
[50:06] Christ
[50:08] &gt;&gt; because the scripture when Peter's and
[50:09] and the 11 are up there said that same
[50:11] Jesus that you know he said he's was
[50:14] made both Lord and Christ.
[50:18] So when we baptize, we name we we
[50:19] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:21] Christ
[50:24] because this is the because the other
[50:26] scripture tells us that Jesus tells them
[50:28] to do that. But when they come out of
[50:29] the upper room and filled with the Holy
[50:31] Ghost and began to preach, then he comes
[50:33] back and Peter stands there and tells
[50:34] them he said this is the scripture that
[50:36] has promise.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; He said because if you do this, he said
[50:41] this, you shall receive the gift of the
[50:43] Holy Ghost.
[50:46] because he said, "This scripture is unto
[50:49] you and to your children and to them
[50:51] that are a far off, even as many as the
[50:53] Lord our God shall call."
[50:56] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WILL STILL baptize that way
[51:00] and they've been holding on to it for
[51:01] the forever.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; But if you actually just take the
[51:06] scripture and actually just say, "Well,
[51:09] I'm going to step back and I'm going to
[51:10] sit here and I'm going to read." Because
[51:11] how many times did the prophet say,
[51:13] "Now, now I know this goes against your
[51:15] doctrine."
[51:17] He said, "No." He said, "Now listen." He
[51:18] said, "But turn the tape off and get
[51:20] your Bible and read. Write these
[51:22] scriptures down when you go home. Read
[51:24] this. Read the scripture."
[51:28] How many times go back into scripture
[51:30] and read and pray about this.
[51:35] Oh no,
[51:37] my preacher told me this and my preacher
[51:39] told me that.
[51:43] What do you know for yourself?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; What did you learn for yourself?
[51:49] &gt;&gt; No, I got I got a little pamphlet from
[51:50] the from the back the rack at the back
[51:52] of the church and it says, "These are
[51:54] the things that we believe."
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And then we just put our blinders on.
[52:00] It's like, "This is what the church
[52:01] taught me."
[52:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what? and they go and they
[52:05] go no further than that because they
[52:07] never have a true experience for
[52:08] themselves because they never can get
[52:10] beyond what the church taught them.
[52:16] But if you but as he was as as Kurt
[52:18] Cameron was talking about you know he
[52:20] actually sat down he began to read these
[52:21] things and he began to study these
[52:24] things and now everybody wants to
[52:25] crucify him because it's like well
[52:27] listen this is and he took the time to
[52:29] read it
[52:30] &gt;&gt; and I was like well you know I may not
[52:32] agree with everything but at least I
[52:33] appreciate the man actually standing up
[52:34] and reading the Bible and praying about
[52:36] it
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and he's like I can see where this
[52:39] doesn't fit the scripture. here. He said
[52:42] when you go to the Old Testament, you
[52:43] look at all the old the the groups in
[52:45] the Old Testament, all the tribes and
[52:47] everything like that. And he talks about
[52:48] even when when you look at when he talks
[52:52] about Egypt and a lot of the u old
[52:54] testament prophets when they begin to
[52:56] talk about all these Babylon and
[52:57] different things like that. That's a
[52:59] spiritual understanding. That's a
[53:00] spiritual kingdom. Not always natural.
[53:02] It's a spiritual kingdom that he's
[53:04] talking about. But he's talking about
[53:05] them being done away with, annihilated,
[53:07] perishing, all those type things. there
[53:09] is they're doing away with them. They're
[53:11] not. And he said the same thing we with
[53:13] because you look at it your sins your
[53:16] sins are being done away with. All those
[53:18] are annihilated. They're forgotten.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; But you're receiving God's life.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And so then when you don't receive that,
[53:26] then you're cut off from God and you're
[53:28] going to perish just like that.
[53:32] And I was like, man, I appreciate
[53:35] somebody actually sitting down because
[53:36] it's like, well, this is what this is
[53:37] what I've always been taught. Well,
[53:40] let's let's actually just take the time
[53:41] to actually thank, you know, thank God
[53:43] that God came by our way and began to
[53:45] speak to us because some somewhere along
[53:47] God began to speak to us because we had
[53:49] our own ideas. We had our own confusion
[53:51] and lots of times we just held on to it.
[53:55] We were still confused, but that's all
[53:57] we knew
[53:58] &gt;&gt; until God came came along and began to
[54:00] speak to us and and praise God, he began
[54:02] to show us things
[54:05] &gt;&gt; and bring us to a place, hey, I
[54:06] understand these things. I see these
[54:08] things in the scripture. Not everybody
[54:09] sees that,
[54:12] &gt;&gt; but that's all right.
[54:14] See, he sent somebody our way to show us
[54:16] these things
[54:18] &gt;&gt; that we could see these things. Just
[54:20] like just as Moses, you be going down
[54:22] there and you know here they began to
[54:24] cry for a deliverer. They're in Egypt.
[54:28] Well, you know what? God came along told
[54:30] Moses, "Guess what? You're the
[54:31] deliverer.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Your mama and your daddy been praying
[54:37] and seeking God that they want to
[54:39] deliver. All these people out here that
[54:41] have been under these task masters are
[54:43] looking for a deliverer, somebody to.
[54:45] And you know, he's like me.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:52] God called you to be the deliverer. The
[54:56] commission's given to you
[54:58] &gt;&gt; and oh, I can't do this and I can't do
[55:00] that. Well, you know what? You've been
[55:02] through all the struggles and the
[55:03] problems and the trials that you've been
[55:05] through because it makes you who you
[55:06] are.
[55:09] And lots of times we have we receive
[55:11] that same commission.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; We're not a deliverer, but you know
[55:14] what? We're a child of God and we're
[55:16] we're to overcome the world.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; We're we're to overcome. We're we're
[55:20] we're here to show Jesus Christ walking
[55:24] in human flesh that you and I are God's
[55:27] hands. We're God's eyes. We're God's
[55:29] mouth. We're God's feet
[55:32] &gt;&gt; to reach to reach the world. You are the
[55:34] one that they're looking at.
[55:37] and he's like, "Well, I can't do this."
[55:39] You can be what God called you to be.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You show you show God in the way that
[55:44] God wants you to show him.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; God will put words in your mouth that
[55:48] you you'll be amazed sometimes when
[55:50] you're standing there talking to people
[55:51] and you're thinking, "This ain't me."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; How many times have you began to speak
[55:58] in a situation and somebody asks you a
[56:00] question or say something to you and
[56:02] it's like,
[56:04] "Well, you know what? I'm just enjoying
[56:05] this myself cuz it ain't me.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden, you get the
[56:09] uncction to speak.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And he begins to speak through you.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; He brings to your remembrance the things
[56:16] to say.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm amazed sometimes, you know, and
[56:20] then other times you get done and you
[56:22] walk away. It's like, I should have said
[56:23] this. I should have said that.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what? God give you the word
[56:28] to speak in that moment. Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; He'll give you what you need, what needs
[56:34] to be said in that moment to those
[56:35] people.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; So, he brought the the people. He sent
[56:42] Moses down there to bring the people
[56:44] out. And all they had to do is follow
[56:46] that the message that came to them.
[56:48] Here's the message that came. And he and
[56:50] he came through every situation that the
[56:53] children of Israel as they were going
[56:54] through every situation that came
[56:57] through, he brought them through that.
[57:01] Every situation
[57:03] when they came to the Red Sea, he was
[57:05] the delivery. He gave Moses the word to
[57:08] speak. Why are you crying to me? Speak
[57:09] the word and go forward.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; You've been given the commission to go
[57:13] forward. You're going in the promised
[57:15] land.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Why are you looking behind? Why are you
[57:18] so worried about what's behind you?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Well, here's here's the Egyptian army
[57:25] coming and got this great water. That's
[57:27] all right.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; You've been given the commission to
[57:32] speak.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So, when you when you come up to a hard
[57:36] place in your life, what do you do? You
[57:38] speak the word of God.
[57:41] All you got to do just like just like
[57:42] brother Ryan his sister Gabby when all
[57:44] the problems come and you hey there
[57:46] there's no good word you don't get a
[57:48] good word from nobody. Guess what? My
[57:50] Bible's full of good words.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible's full of it.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; I don't have to take what the doctor
[57:57] says
[57:58] &gt;&gt; just like they did. You just say praise
[58:00] God. The word said he calls us a healer,
[58:03] a deliverer, a comforter, a guide.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Well, whatever comes, you know what? I'm
[58:09] g I'm I'm gonna dig right in this in
[58:11] this treasure trove here and I'm gonna
[58:13] dig out the things that that fit my
[58:15] situation. And you know what? I'm gonna
[58:16] feast on what God said.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Then all of a sudden
[58:20] when you come to church and you praise
[58:22] God because you know what? God gives and
[58:24] God takes away. God delivers whatever he
[58:26] comes. We're going to worship God. We're
[58:28] going to praise God for what? His
[58:29] goodness to us. And we may not
[58:31] understand all these situations, but God
[58:33] is still in control. He's still sitting
[58:35] on the throne. And he's always going
[58:37] going to be in charge. And whether it
[58:39] comes or goes, whatever, whether we like
[58:41] it or not, praise God, it'll always work
[58:43] to our good.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; It'll always be to our benefit.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Well, then all of a sudden, when you
[58:49] trust God and you follow what he had to
[58:51] say, then all of a sudden then all all
[58:53] of a sudden these things begin to
[58:54] change. When it looks like it's your
[58:56] darkest hour and it don't look like
[58:57] anything's going to change, all of a
[58:59] sudden, you know what? The angel of the
[59:00] Lord comes by and he begins to touch
[59:02] that situation. It begins to change and
[59:04] all of a sudden it's like, "That wasn't
[59:06] man.
[59:08] That wasn't medical science.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; We don't know how that took place. Well,
[59:12] we do.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; The God of heaven came down in this
[59:16] situation. Now, we allowed him to work.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; We give him the we because lots of times
[59:22] we get in the way.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; It's like, well, you know what? We just
[59:26] follow the Lord. We just Lord, just have
[59:28] your way.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to trust you because this is
[59:32] what the scripture says. Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Well, every situation that they went
[59:37] through, God brought them all the way
[59:38] through.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; When it looked when it looked
[59:42] impossible, God was the God of
[59:44] impossibility.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; He's the God of possibility and
[59:48] impossibility.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And he brought them all the way through.
[59:51] when they didn't have anything and they
[59:53] were standing there murmuring and
[59:54] complaining that they didn't have
[59:55] anything. God was the God of supply and
[59:58] he met every one of their needs and he
[1:00:00] led them all the way through and began
[1:00:02] to encourage them and lead them all the
[1:00:04] way and began to speak to them and show
[1:00:05] them what was going to take place. And
[1:00:07] it's because of their unbelief that they
[1:00:09] stay out of the promised land. Yeah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; stood there and told him, he said,
[1:00:13] "Listen," he said, "your children, who
[1:00:15] you think are going to be a prey, that
[1:00:17] they're going to be killed in this
[1:00:19] wilderness," he said, "They're going to
[1:00:20] go in.
[1:00:23] They come out."
[1:00:26] Oh, if God God done all the miracles to
[1:00:28] bring you out, then praise God, he doing
[1:00:30] the miracles to bring you in.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And they got out there and going around
[1:00:35] in the same circle. Oh, got in the rut.
[1:00:40] down there in the rut of doubt and
[1:00:41] despair and everything like that and God
[1:00:43] trying to get them
[1:00:45] 40 years in the same mess when they
[1:00:47] could when they could have got been down
[1:00:48] there in two weeks.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we wonder why God don't
[1:00:54] come. Well, you know, he's the God that
[1:00:56] delivers. Well, the problem is is we
[1:00:57] like to stay in the rut.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we battle the same thing.
[1:01:02] We've been battling it for years and
[1:01:04] years and years and we wonder why we
[1:01:05] can't get out. Well, you know what?
[1:01:06] Because we ain't allowed God. Because we
[1:01:07] hadn't surrendered.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; We hadn't fully surrendered and like,
[1:01:15] "Well, Lord, I'm not I'm not going to do
[1:01:16] anything. We're just going to follow
[1:01:18] you." And it's like, but we get stuck in
[1:01:19] a rut,
[1:01:21] but praise God, God kept his word
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; and he brought them all the way through.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; He brought them all the way through into
[1:01:29] the promised land. Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a you you see all the
[1:01:34] way through when he brought them in and
[1:01:36] there they were outnumbered, outmanned,
[1:01:42] but you know, every time he turned
[1:01:43] around, sent the sent the 12 spies in.
[1:01:45] Hey, the land's exactly the way God said
[1:01:47] it was going to be.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Here you got everything that you have
[1:01:51] need of
[1:01:53] and well, we can't we can't go in. We're
[1:01:56] like grasshoppers in their sight.
[1:01:59] But you know, as soon as they go in the
[1:02:01] land,
[1:02:03] soon as they get in the land, they get
[1:02:04] over there, but you know, the spies were
[1:02:06] over there previously.
[1:02:09] And you know, they met a lady named
[1:02:10] Rahab, but when they went over there,
[1:02:12] they were talking to Rahab. You know
[1:02:13] what we heard when Goded the waters, you
[1:02:16] know what? Our hearts melted. You know,
[1:02:17] we just didn't have no fight in us.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; We did. We knew that it was over with.
[1:02:22] We knew the enemy knew that it was over
[1:02:24] with before the start fight ever
[1:02:25] started.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But you know what? The children of
[1:02:29] Israel, the one that had the promise,
[1:02:32] that were more than conquerors, they
[1:02:33] were afraid to fight
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and not realizing the victory was
[1:02:37] already theirs.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You're fighting a defeated enemy.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; You're you're fighting a defeated foe,
[1:02:45] but many TIMES WE DON'T WANT TO GET in
[1:02:46] the fight.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; We're afraid to get in the fight, but
[1:02:52] he's already defeated. Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, they rose up and
[1:02:57] they went into the land
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and took their possession.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You and I, we have the same we have the
[1:03:04] same opportunity to face the great the
[1:03:07] great enemy.
[1:03:10] But you know what? We're more than
[1:03:11] conquerors through him that loved us to
[1:03:13] come through and receive exactly what we
[1:03:16] have need of
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; and receive what God has for us.
[1:03:20] You know, there's many in this in the
[1:03:22] scripture where we see that that went
[1:03:24] through all these things and you know
[1:03:29] the the next person that you know I want
[1:03:32] to I want to look at here and when we go
[1:03:36] beyond the children of Israel but you
[1:03:38] you see them in the land and you know
[1:03:40] God's still bringing to pass his word
[1:03:43] the promises that he made and told him
[1:03:45] he was going to because Isaiah made a
[1:03:48] promise God spoke spoke to him and he
[1:03:50] began to speak that he was going a
[1:03:52] virgin shall can save and bear a son.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You know because still even from the
[1:03:58] beginning that God was going to come to
[1:03:59] the place that even Joseph was looking
[1:04:02] for that God was going to come to the
[1:04:04] promised land.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He was looking and they and so all you
[1:04:07] look at all the way through the land all
[1:04:09] through history they're promise they're
[1:04:11] looking to those promises and they've
[1:04:12] heard them well they some people they
[1:04:14] just got to the point where it was just
[1:04:16] fairy tales. It was just words. Yeah.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; But you know, there was still people
[1:04:19] that were reading the scripture and
[1:04:21] still believing that that God was going
[1:04:22] to fulfill that.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; And you know, you see here in the
[1:04:27] scripture where brother Ram was talking
[1:04:28] about the great scholar Zachcharias,
[1:04:30] you know, here he is and having the word
[1:04:33] come and the angel Gabriel coming to him
[1:04:35] and began to speak to him and tell him
[1:04:37] what was going to take place that, you
[1:04:39] know, his that him and his wife that
[1:04:41] couldn't have children, but God was
[1:04:43] going to come on the scene and they were
[1:04:44] going to bring forth a son named John.
[1:04:46] That's right.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; And he's going he's going to fulfill the
[1:04:49] scripture that he's going to be the
[1:04:51] forerunner to the Messiah.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; And you know, here's Zachcharias. Well,
[1:04:57] he can read the scripture. Well educated
[1:04:59] man, a scholar. He knew what the
[1:05:00] scripture had to say. He knew all about
[1:05:02] it. He knew what the prophecies were
[1:05:03] that was going to take place. But he
[1:05:05] couldn't believe that God was going to
[1:05:07] come on the scene and and do what he
[1:05:09] said he would do.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; But here's here's here's another Mary
[1:05:14] standing there.
[1:05:16] Brother Brandham said that Zachcharias
[1:05:18] could see in the scripture that what
[1:05:20] took place before was going to take
[1:05:22] place to him and Elizabeth.
[1:05:25] But what Mary had to believe never
[1:05:27] happened before.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; But she said, "Be it unto me according
[1:05:32] to thy word."
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; She didn't understand how it was going
[1:05:36] to take place. But you know what? When
[1:05:38] the angel began to speak the word to
[1:05:40] her, she's like, "You know what? That's
[1:05:41] mine.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm because I'm just going to
[1:05:45] take it at what what he said.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to figure it out
[1:05:50] because the Holy Spirit's going to
[1:05:51] overshadow you. You're going to have a
[1:05:53] son.
[1:05:55] It's like don't have to try to figure it
[1:05:57] all out.
[1:05:59] I just believe what God told me. Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; You out of out of all the millions of
[1:06:05] women that are in in Egypt, all the all
[1:06:07] the virgins that are down here, all the
[1:06:09] virgins all through history, God would
[1:06:11] pick you.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? That's God's
[1:06:15] election.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; You know what? That don't make me
[1:06:21] anything.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That makes him everything.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't pick it, but he did.
[1:06:30] Well, I'm not going I'm not going to
[1:06:32] argue about it. I'm just going to accept
[1:06:33] it.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; What'd she do? She began to she held on
[1:06:40] to that word
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; when nobody else believed that,
[1:06:46] you know,
[1:06:49] and here's Joseph trying to trying to
[1:06:51] believe this same thing that here here's
[1:06:54] the word she trying to believe. He's
[1:06:56] trying to believe this. But God showed
[1:06:58] him in a dream what this was going to
[1:07:00] be. Began to speak to him and he's like,
[1:07:03] "Well, you know what? Nobody else is
[1:07:04] going to believe any of this."
[1:07:07] But you know what? It's her faith and
[1:07:10] it's his faith that they're walking in.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And and and until
[1:07:17] time came along, you know, the 28 days,
[1:07:20] she'd have she'd have no proof.
[1:07:24] But you know what? in time they began to
[1:07:25] see something that began to take place
[1:07:28] in her body and she began to notice hey
[1:07:30] you know what something's taking place
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; it's
[1:07:36] shame shame shame see them people
[1:07:42] well you can believe whether whether it
[1:07:43] was of God or not but it was
[1:07:46] but you know what she carried that
[1:07:48] reproach but you know what she knew what
[1:07:49] was what took place inside of her
[1:07:52] because you know what nobody else had
[1:07:54] that angel experience.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Had that angel visitation.
[1:08:00] It's the same way with you and I. You
[1:08:02] try to tell people about having the
[1:08:04] visitation of the Holy Spirit to you and
[1:08:06] the Holy Spirit began to speak to you.
[1:08:11] Well, we just come down to the altar and
[1:08:13] we shake hands with the preacher and we
[1:08:15] make a decision
[1:08:19] and it's just like going up to just like
[1:08:21] going up to the buffet and deciding
[1:08:23] where whether whether I want chicken pot
[1:08:25] pie or beef tips and I just decided I
[1:08:29] just wanted the beef tips
[1:08:32] and whether I wanted whole kernel corn
[1:08:34] or cream corn and I made my decision
[1:08:39] whether I want banana pudding or
[1:08:41] chocolate pie. I just made a decision.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; When those people that received the word
[1:08:48] from Jesus when they went into the upper
[1:08:51] room, he said, "Try ye here
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; until you be endued with power from on
[1:08:56] high."
[1:08:58] And they just didn't walk out the door
[1:09:00] that way going,
[1:09:02] "We made a decision today.
[1:09:06] We received the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:11] And it was wonderful.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Think we'll go get some coffee now.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; No, they stayed there till something
[1:09:19] took place in them.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And when when they left, they were
[1:09:26] different than when they went in that
[1:09:27] room.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; They were a bunch of cowards that went
[1:09:30] into that upper room. When they came
[1:09:32] out, there was something that was
[1:09:33] burning on the inside of them that had
[1:09:36] zeal that was overflowing from them that
[1:09:38] you know what? They were sharing it with
[1:09:39] everybody and they didn't care who knew
[1:09:41] what they had.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; So when when they had these things take
[1:09:48] place, you know, she knew what was when
[1:09:50] Mary knew what was taking place. Well,
[1:09:51] she began to walk in that, she knew what
[1:09:54] was what she had experienced and she
[1:09:55] began to walk in this and she began to
[1:09:57] talk about it when she went to Elizabeth
[1:09:59] and and began to speak to her cousin.
[1:10:01] Listen, hey, God has overshadowed me.
[1:10:05] We're gonna we're going to see the
[1:10:06] fulfillment of scripture.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's like, well, you know what? God
[1:10:09] spoke to us and we're going to have a
[1:10:11] son, too. And you know, John been laying
[1:10:13] there for six months, hadn't moved,
[1:10:14] hadn't done nothing, but at the name of
[1:10:16] Jesus, all of a sudden, he jumps in his
[1:10:18] mother's womb and sees a miracle take
[1:10:20] place.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Well, here she is going through all of
[1:10:24] that. But you know what? When when and
[1:10:26] all the things that they were going
[1:10:27] through, and then here she is carrying
[1:10:30] this childhood. Well, guess what?
[1:10:33] The government tells us that we got to
[1:10:35] go to Bethlehem.
[1:10:37] We got to pay taxes. And you can't just
[1:10:40] pay now. You can't pay online. You got
[1:10:43] to travel all this way
[1:10:46] to put it in the coffers
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; because you know we don't do anything
[1:10:51] convenient,
[1:10:53] but it had to fulfill scripture.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And here they are going on this journey.
[1:11:00] But you know long time before that God
[1:11:03] began to speak to the magi when they
[1:11:06] began to see the sign in the heavens and
[1:11:09] they began to journey.
[1:11:13] She didn't know that. Joseph didn't know
[1:11:15] that.
[1:11:18] But God was on the back side
[1:11:21] on the other side speaking to those men.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; They began to see the signs in the
[1:11:26] heaven. Oh, look.
[1:11:29] The Savior's coming. The Messiah is
[1:11:31] coming.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; The King of the Earth is coming.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; The ruler is coming. We can see it by
[1:11:39] the stars. We know what's going to take
[1:11:41] place.
[1:11:42] And here they become to journey
[1:11:46] carrying gold, frankincense, and myrr.
[1:11:49] And here's this whole, you know, humble
[1:11:51] little girl with her husband to be going
[1:11:55] all this way to pay taxes
[1:12:00] and not and having to go through all of
[1:12:02] the things that they had to go through.
[1:12:06] Here here's here's the God of heaven
[1:12:08] coming to be born in a stable,
[1:12:11] you know, having having the least of
[1:12:13] everything,
[1:12:15] having having nothing. No comforts of
[1:12:18] home because you're far away from home.
[1:12:20] There's nothing. You don't Who does she
[1:12:22] who does she know in town?
[1:12:25] Maybe nobody.
[1:12:28] We don't know. We don't know what We
[1:12:30] just know it was her and and Joseph. We
[1:12:32] don't know who else was there.
[1:12:35] But here she is around all them stinking
[1:12:38] animals. Maybe they maybe they went over
[1:12:40] and cleaned out a little spot for her to
[1:12:41] lay down
[1:12:45] for her to have a baby.
[1:12:49] But you know when when he came on the
[1:12:51] earth he went straight to the angels
[1:12:54] came to the shepherds and began to
[1:12:56] proclaim
[1:12:57] that the king of kings was born. The
[1:13:00] fulfillment of the scripture.
[1:13:03] And the shepherds came to see.
[1:13:06] It's like,
[1:13:08] who knew that they were in town? Who
[1:13:11] knew that they were having a baby? Who
[1:13:12] knew any of these things?
[1:13:15] And it's all of a sudden hear all these
[1:13:16] people. It's like, well, they should be
[1:13:18] in the fields or whatever, you know? And
[1:13:19] all of a sudden, here's all these
[1:13:20] shepherds coming along and it's like,
[1:13:23] well, why are they coming?
[1:13:26] And it's like, well, you know, I'm sure
[1:13:27] they didn't just sneak into town
[1:13:29] because, you know, I mean, if I had a
[1:13:31] heavenly host come singing to me and
[1:13:32] telling me that this was going to be
[1:13:34] this has happened, the King of all glory
[1:13:37] has come and now we're seeing this is
[1:13:39] the fulfillment of scripture.
[1:13:42] I may not even be walking straight.
[1:13:45] You know, all of a sudden, it's like,
[1:13:48] the rest of y'all see any of this?
[1:13:51] We saw this. You know, it's like these
[1:13:54] people that, you know, I hate to say it,
[1:13:56] but you know, you you see these people
[1:13:57] that talk about seeing UFOs and they're
[1:13:59] all like, and it's like, I think you're
[1:14:06] we have we have a nice little room over
[1:14:08] here that's padded.
[1:14:12] We we have we have a nice little
[1:14:13] medication for you to take.
[1:14:17] It's like, oh no. Every time we have a
[1:14:20] gathering with the government,
[1:14:22] those that are a little bit not so
[1:14:25] stable show up.
[1:14:28] And here they are in Bethlehem.
[1:14:32] But it's God showing.
[1:14:36] And here they are,
[1:14:38] Mary and Joseph going all this time. And
[1:14:40] here comes the Magi come into town.
[1:14:44] Where is he born king of the Jews?
[1:14:47] when they had went through all of that
[1:14:49] and nobody and not realizing that God
[1:14:52] had those people coming, the magi coming
[1:14:55] to talk to show and brought the gifts
[1:14:59] here. He is deity dedicated to death
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the scripture and they
[1:15:07] thought, well, you know, nobody else
[1:15:09] sees that. But you know what?
[1:15:12] It was seen by them.
[1:15:15] It wasn't for everybody. It was for a
[1:15:18] selected few.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; But it was confirmation to the word that
[1:15:23] Mary held.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; It was a confirmation to their faith.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; That God was beginning to do these
[1:15:30] things.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Here's the fulfillment of the scripture.
[1:15:33] When everybody else thought it was
[1:15:38] ridiculous,
[1:15:40] idolatry, whatever. Oh, here you are
[1:15:44] making yourself something, thinking that
[1:15:46] you're going to bring forth the Messiah.
[1:15:52] She's just following what the word said.
[1:15:56] You got to watch these people.
[1:15:59] You can't you can't have you can't have
[1:16:00] good You can't have good people in your
[1:16:02] neighborhood. You got to watch them. You
[1:16:04] just We don't We don't want these people
[1:16:05] in our church. They just bring the
[1:16:07] church down
[1:16:09] and not realizing that God is speaking
[1:16:11] to them.
[1:16:14] That was the That was the visitation of
[1:16:16] God.
[1:16:18] How many pe How many people walk past
[1:16:20] Mary and Joseph on that journey and not
[1:16:24] realizing that they're fulfilling the
[1:16:26] scripture?
[1:16:29] People reading the scripture and then
[1:16:31] walking past and they're the fulfillment
[1:16:33] of the scripture.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; People reading the scripture not
[1:16:38] realizing that you and I are the ones
[1:16:40] that's fulfilling the scripture.
[1:16:44] God's what what's God doing today? What
[1:16:46] you know, I I wish I could see the move
[1:16:48] of God
[1:16:49] and they shake hands with you.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; They rub shoulders with you
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; and you begin to speak to them and they
[1:16:56] don't realize that that's their time of
[1:16:59] visitation.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; God is speaking to them. God's showing
[1:17:03] them and they miss it.
[1:17:07] when they came into when the when the
[1:17:09] magi came and here here's Herod when it
[1:17:13] you know when it when they come into
[1:17:14] town and you know he didn't even he
[1:17:16] didn't even give them um a serious
[1:17:21] thought
[1:17:27] because he didn't he didn't understand
[1:17:29] that what the scripture said it's not an
[1:17:32] earthly kingdom
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; it's a spiritual kingdom
[1:17:37] But what do you Oh well well let let me
[1:17:39] know where the Christ child is born so I
[1:17:41] can come worship him too.
[1:17:44] And then what what's the next thing he's
[1:17:45] doing? When when was he supposed to be
[1:17:47] born?
[1:17:49] When did all these things take place?
[1:17:52] We got to do some investigation.
[1:17:54] Oh, two years. Hey. Well, all the boys
[1:17:59] two years and younger, take them out.
[1:18:02] we're going to get rid of them.
[1:18:05] And not realizing
[1:18:07] the same God that spoke this into
[1:18:10] existence, that overshadowed Mary, that
[1:18:13] spoke to the magi, that spoke to the
[1:18:15] shepherds,
[1:18:18] led them to the to Bethlehem to be the
[1:18:21] fulfillment of the scripture where Jesus
[1:18:24] was to be born. Oh, you don't you don't
[1:18:27] know that God was going to speak to them
[1:18:28] and tell them to leave.
[1:18:32] Hey, time for you to get up and go. And
[1:18:35] where'd they go? They went to Egypt. Oh,
[1:18:37] to fulfill the scripture.
[1:18:40] Out of Egypt, I've called my son.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? He had to be in Egypt
[1:18:46] to come out of Egypt.
[1:18:50] Well, there was a fulfillment of the
[1:18:52] scripture
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and not realizing that that was his day
[1:18:56] of visitation
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; and he didn't look at it seriously
[1:19:01] enough that he missed his day of
[1:19:03] visitation
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; that the word of God came to him and he
[1:19:09] turned it down.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; He missed his day. And brother Ram said,
[1:19:14] "See, it's the same way with us."
[1:19:18] He said, "Don't let that be to us." He
[1:19:21] said, "This is our visitation time."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's remember Christ that
[1:19:26] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:28] forever."
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8.
[1:19:32] He said, ' Don't wait till some regions
[1:19:34] yonder in the damned in that dimension
[1:19:37] where you cannot go into the presence of
[1:19:39] God and your time is up on earth in the
[1:19:42] nightmare of horror. You'll remember you
[1:19:44] had your opportunity and you turned it
[1:19:47] away.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the young people take
[1:19:50] notice to this. Let let all take notice
[1:19:54] to it."
[1:19:58] See, it's our time of visitation.
[1:20:01] God's speaking to each one of us. Our
[1:20:02] now is our time to receive.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; We always need to make sure that that we
[1:20:09] have received what we claim
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; that we that we have what what God
[1:20:14] requires.
[1:20:18] See, this is this is to us.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; The word of God came in our day.
[1:20:26] Praise God. We received a message.
[1:20:29] And just like all of those, it's not to
[1:20:31] the world.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Many people turn it down. They don't
[1:20:36] believe it.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, they they oh, they oh, they've read
[1:20:39] it and they've studied it. Many of them
[1:20:42] have actually claimed said, "Oh, this
[1:20:44] this is the truth." And you know, I I'll
[1:20:46] bank my soul on this. And you know what?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; They they ain't within
[1:20:52] They wouldn't touch it with a 10-ft pole
[1:20:53] now.
[1:20:57] you know, after after they've been
[1:20:59] through so many things and oh, I I'm I'm
[1:21:02] sold out to this message
[1:21:05] and now and now they they wouldn't be
[1:21:07] within 300 miles of it
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and not realizing they had their day of
[1:21:12] visitation.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But praise God, he spoke to us.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; God has given us our day of visitation
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the scripture.
[1:21:25] And when he give us this day of
[1:21:26] visitation,
[1:21:28] what is it to do? It's for us to bring
[1:21:30] forth Jesus Christ
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; just as Mary did to show the world Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Here I want to I want to finish with
[1:21:40] this. This quote is from the message the
[1:21:42] uncertain sound. Musicians can come if
[1:21:44] you if you will tonight.
[1:21:47] Brother Brandham's in the message
[1:21:48] uncertain sound. I love this quote. He
[1:21:50] says, "Heavenly Father, I pray the
[1:21:52] prayer for them with all my heart." He
[1:21:55] said, "I give them to you their trophies
[1:21:58] of the message. They're trophies of your
[1:22:01] visitation."
[1:22:02] Being here tonight, he said, "Seeing you
[1:22:05] walk among us doing works that never
[1:22:08] have been done since the foundation of
[1:22:10] the world unto these days, here they
[1:22:12] are. They're your children." He said, "I
[1:22:14] commend them to you, Lord. You give them
[1:22:17] to us and then we give them to you in
[1:22:19] the name of Jesus Christ. He said,
[1:22:21] "Watch over them and raise them up at
[1:22:23] the last day." He said, "I may never be
[1:22:26] able to shake their hands on this
[1:22:27] earth." He said, ' But when the battle's
[1:22:30] over and the last trumpet has sounded,
[1:22:32] and the dead has risen from the grave
[1:22:35] and the live has been called up together
[1:22:37] with them to meet the Lord in the air,
[1:22:39] then may I have fellowship with Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ and them through around the
[1:22:44] throne and through the eternal ages that
[1:22:46] is to come. He said, "Grant it, Lord.
[1:22:48] They are yours in the name of Jesus
[1:22:50] Christ." Amen.
[1:22:53] I thank God
[1:22:56] for my day of visitation.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to say I'm a trophy of this
[1:23:02] message.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a trophy of his visitation.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That we've received a visitation from
[1:23:12] him.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; The world can pass by whatever can
[1:23:16] happen, but praise God, I'm anchored.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; I can't be shaken. I can't be moved.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; I love I love that song that Brother Joe
[1:23:27] sings sometimes.
[1:23:29] I'll stand for Jesus
[1:23:31] and let the world go by. Why? He stood
[1:23:34] for me.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He stood for me and took my place.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; And brought me to this place and put me
[1:23:44] on a firm foundation.
[1:23:48] The world is full of of idols that
[1:23:52] people have set up. Oh, they they they
[1:23:54] read the message and and they and they
[1:23:56] and they say, "Oh, brother Brown,
[1:23:58] brother Brown's a prophet. God sent a
[1:23:59] prophet." But you know what? They've got
[1:24:02] their idols set up.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Are we holding on to things that's
[1:24:10] unpleasing to the Lord?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to hinder me.
[1:24:16] And I don't want to be a hindrance to
[1:24:18] you.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But thank God what he's done for us.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing a song, brother.

[1:31:37] Father, we thank you once again for the
[1:31:39] opportunity that you've given us to be
[1:31:40] in the house of God. We can truly say,
[1:31:42] Lord, it's been good, Father God, to be
[1:31:45] in your presence, Lord Jesus. It was
[1:31:48] good, Father God, to hear from you, Lord
[1:31:50] Jesus. And so, Father, as we leave this
[1:31:54] place, but Lord, never your presence,
[1:31:56] Father. We ask, Lord Jesus, that you
[1:31:59] would be with us the rest of this week.
[1:32:01] Strengthen us, heavenly father. Lord,
[1:32:04] let us just have faith and confidence,
[1:32:06] Lord God, that you are working all
[1:32:09] things together for our good, Lord
[1:32:11] Jesus, and that you are, heavenly
[1:32:13] father, in control, and you're in
[1:32:15] charge, Lord Jesus. And Father, you
[1:32:17] would lead us the rest of the way.
[1:32:20] Heavenly Father, we just love you. We
[1:32:22] commit ourselves now into your hands.
[1:32:24] Protect the saints as they head back to
[1:32:27] their respective places.
[1:32:30] protect those that may be traveling,
[1:32:31] Lord, this week, Father. May you just
[1:32:34] watch over them and we just commit
[1:32:36] ourselves now to you. We love you. We
[1:32:38] thank you. Give breath to Brother Aaron
