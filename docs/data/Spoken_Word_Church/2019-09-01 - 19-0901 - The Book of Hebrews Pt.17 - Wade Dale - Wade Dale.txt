========================================

one less yet who did the last we need to laugh you didn't laugh yeah I'm gonna turn it Louise police would be doing it nothing I like it I don't meet brother Tim hems in two weeks or so not this coming weekend Burroughs Matthew Braille be here and then we're at also pranks right we're having our youth thing Saturday so I remember that we're getting it started special well look got star something about yeah well Joe you got directed to everybody brother you can't just you can't you involve can't be said there'll be no but you got to you got to Lane everybody's name Wayne hey OH you take Joyce [Music] that girl bro when we all will be ready all right let's go we got where Hebrews 11 and I want you to also remember like I said we'll be at Tim hems in two weeks remember us there but then also remember today we're starting on day of 70 weeks so we're gonna do a lengthy pan out where today we're just gonna be Bible we're just going to go do the Bible remember we've done it down here like two years ago again and we're going to look at it through a Jewish perspective because anytime you say Daniel 70 weeks what's the first thing you do well there's contention between three and a half and seventh is that three and a half years left or seven well that's not - that's not Daniel 10 - wait that man's idea right that's man interjecting so we're going to go into the Bible and let the Bible prove it but we're gonna have to take it from a Jewish perspective because Dan seven new weeks it's not to Gentiles it is only to the Jews we were interjected and I'll show you the chart later a long time from now but we were in projected because to get a Gentile bride if not that same would have been dry here together than when the middle church ages they wanted to be no menu that would have just been the Jewish all the way through and then they would it took the rapture - prophets would have come but no that's not the way though the Bible said the Gentiles will be in possession are grafted in the Gentiles will be grafted in for God to take a bride because we're going to look today where we'll see where Jehovah divorced Israel right and then in Jeremiah tells you that you if once your wife is polluted with another man you can't take her back so he couldn't take Israel back as a while again he took her back as serving far as remnant or ever now you want to call it but we're going to read in Jeremiah because remember Daniel starts off I know about books so what was the book he was reading he would read Jeremiah and it talks about the captivity and why they went into captivity see you got to understand that once you understand that then you'll understand the rest of Daniel seventy weeks it really doesn't have anything to do with three and a half and seven but to line it up it had everything to do with putting the scripture together so that the scripture can tell us what's going on right and I believe there is there is a big thick tension still and then maybe we will try to smooth it out a little bit but you gotta go by the Bible I'm gonna tell you this after a minute remember one thing just like brother George Quinn scripture cannot be broken scripture has to be fulfilled brother Brown didn't come to change the Bible he never changed one worse or whatever he says that you may think is different you're wrong right the Bible is not wrong the probably God according to what he preached is not wrong if it's wrong left then then truly we do need to find somebody else maybe there is somebody that has truth but no that's not that's not it we know we have Detra is not a lot of people have a tradition and it will show itself later on but you're going to have to bear with me because we're going to start back in Jeremiah today we're just going to read scriptures so you better to keep your Bible well read probably about thirty scriptures but that's how Daniel understood right he read by he understood by books what he read Jeremiah because Jeremiah was commissioned to write there was another boy I can't remember his name he wrote what Jeremiah said he was described and they rolled it up and put it in white yeah that's his name and he wrote it and put it in what bathroom and put it in a the vessel this man preached on it before the oh nothing he'll remember that and they put it in an earthen vessel then they found them in and around all right so just keep us in prayer if we need them you know it's getting cold in town where everything's kinda but there should be no contention in the message that maybe contention in the world the Lord this thing should be smoothy it should be where you have no question where if somebody questions you on anything you have an answer and it's not just your opinion right all right so we're gonna go through the Bible look to it in a Jewish paralyzed and then I think it would clear stuff up well it won't clear itself but we'll clear ourself up the Bible doesn't need clarity the title the Bible is clear that's like you know you like brother Brown said you just don't need a revelation to reach this baptized and they can you describe them just really don't think a revelation you just read in the book but there's a contention there though when Jesus you know how many people he told that to and they said well I'll take what Jesus said well he was saying the same thing to Peter oh you got two different gods which they do to agree so see what I mean we need to be established in what program did present-day tree present-day revelation not a no revelation present a revelation Luther's revelation was preached to him but it sold us you can get in the body of Christ was looted now you get a revelation with the jokes girl lived my faith but you add to that all right same way with this Hebrews 11 I was hoping Wednesday night Louise was talking about the number 11 the number 11 Hebrews 11 the faith chapter of the Bible Hebrews 11 have you ever done that though it took like something just few people corner here take Hebrews 13:8 go read revelations 13 they go go through the Bible and read the thirteenth chapter in the eighth verse all through the Bible get almost all of it relates to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever same way with Hebrews 11 and different ones where the man who preached on the number 17 you take the number 17 and a number 50 if you want and all these different things happen brother Graham says the numerix of the Bible are correct I mean it's not some strange thing it's not something though like they you know you look at something I was researching something on YouTube and this guy I mean he he tastes like the fourth word and the third letter and puts the code together and got Barack Obama and got this and that the other it lasted about five minutes and I lasted about two minutes so that was a that was kind of fun to read but I'm not in that in depth to that you know I revelation is good but that's not revelation that just somebody think it word now you can make anything say what you want insane if you pick the numbers all right let's go Hebrew that isn't Hebrews 11 in heaven because it brings in food Sara the woman through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who they promised no we don't hear a lot about this in Sara in Genesis the account of Genesis you got Abraham Abraham laid with him you've got Sarah and attempt on the laughing in her heart am I gonna have pleasure will my husband again you know one more time or whatever and then God rebuked her but she has have a - this is the pride when I see women in the Bible you have to look at pride of what the bride is doing alright Sarah was Abraham's bride and we've been the Bride of Christ what we've got to receive strength we've got to take a body change to receive the seed Word of God you've already cooked that body change on the inside so you're receiving the Steep Word of God has a potential to your body change the makeover that go Sarah the same way now Sarah had we're all adults if she'd received seed all her life from Abraham little seed and there was no child pretty so she had to have a not just in the outside body chain she had to have her womb had to be redone same way with me and you you wound is gonna have to be redone so they've got you what so you can receive we perceive we've received as Christians we received seed all of our life if you came up badness methods gonna call for whatever whatever ever you've received seed word that may not be the right one it may be a little bit off you know badness Methodists need to eat word but now you you were seeing what Abraham even tried for a long time to produce what was going on right with natural seed but he can do it because God had never told him at first he said you go have a child Oh Sarah now when he comes to meet him and changes him to Abraham and Sarah not said riah Abraham knows then that he's going to produce that child with Sarah and I hate that the the quote keeps coming back to me who brother Graham said they've been Brides brides churches churches Brides churches he makes this big long quote he said what they'll come one Sarah was one she was the one that was gonna bring the promised son not Hagar not cateura now remember Abraham had three wives well I don't think our I guess you wouldn't consider her a wife she was a concubine but you had hagar sara and then when she died yanked the Torah which could mean all kind of types in the world but but you can think you got to take Sarah type of us because we that was the promise the Toro at the cross that was a natural group of people hey Garo Abraham have a little bit weird revelation and thought he could do it with Hagar to get the child he didn't get a child because remember Abraham said all of the dishes when they walk before you he thought God you should know I'm gonna have a son and there is well that's not the right one though the right one was Isaac and it had to come to Sarah that's why you have to boy you watch them through the Old Testament you go how in the world can God and do what he did through no I'm not through faith Rahab ran with the harlot you the whole that's preaching on this last Sunday doesn't choose the prostitute she had a most every man in that in that City of Newark but when all of her accusers died when she had no more accuser I wanted this the rent is rarely general matarese her which she shouldn't have done but Christ had to marry a Gentile bride he went boasted he spoke to many Israel but to bring us in he married this woman that him she was no version by no me but now remember here come Jesse here come over here come David right out of that natural lineage that you would think would be not very pure and in same way he'd go to daily you go to David David could have had any heat probably in his life had thousands of burdens and I mean thousands because you think popular of the kids thousands of the virgin but he wanted that one girl but if I brother brown said you can say what you won't do about it Solomon was gonna come through that woman not all these other ones so so that's the way you look at us you look it up Gentiles it isn't still things for dogs till things were unclean we do unclean things according to the Jewish tradition of the earth or the chill where the children of God they keep saying that where the children done Messiah is coming to us well they missed part we came to us but if they would look you see how blinded they are if they looked in the Old Testament see the tops you've got a Gentile Brides interjected all through the Old Testament and they can't see that but they know the Gentiles are going to come in for what it is they flip-flopped and said we're going to save one of them side come we're going to introduce him you well it's just going to be reverse of that but because they rejected him when we read in jeremiah today where he said I had to put you away and give you a writing of divorcement because you went after other gods so through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful to the promise so she had to believe also okay because when she woke up that morning she had to go through a process to change her body she had to believe something she didn't sweat just laying there going no something clicked inside of her during that time that male candidate was talking to Abraham and it is true that member Tim you were talking about this and I'm gonna preach a little bit on it when we get up there he said actually asked me about it cuz everybody's putting everything on the man all Abraham was this great guy ain't Adam was this great guy these all these great guys the Bible says and out of all that what wait just like a preach that couple Sundays ago or whenever was same way with Sarah there's no way Sarah didn't just all I just believed Abraham no you got have revelation for you son do you got any on Revelation okay so the bride of Jesus Christ it's gotta have a revelation now we know who our husband is and then we know that the child is going to come to us but work on what we're doing we're producing Jesus Christ remember Boaz and Ruth had a baby and they gave it to Naomi which is Israel the old Israel don't array her gave it to remember in the Bible is a hand and who well that's what we're doing we're going to produce the bride and Christ is going to produce Jesus not a baby though we're gonna produce a repro grown man but we're going to introduce that full-grown person the Jews [Applause] her body was on fire because here one must have been dead when she was six down here oh no no no I mean it's it's not something she eats up she believed she had like said she'd been having relation with Abraham since they were 16 years old produced nothing so either he was we know for a fact he wasn't there was anything wrong with his personnel personal try not to be something graphic you know they went wrong with he can produce a child because of Hagar they had a baby and then when Sarah died hey Brandon what seven more kids with the Torah so it was an Abraham see look it's not Dutch problem God's not the problem he's got the original sheet work it was the bride then had a problem so she had to be changed and when you're born again it changes the wound with your line right man so you can receive what the right seed word put it in the right place and it produced the right product okay so when I said that I meant you had to go Jeff D throughout food or anything like that she just had to believe not only not only did she just when when when Abraham let me get to my point when Abraham met Melchizedek Sarah was there heard the whole conversation I don't believe she was out in the pasture right remember she was in the tent they were sitting in front of the tent she must have been right up against the ten kind of things I like the world's going on and when that man spoke and said because he did Abraham don't have a time alive you know what I mean she dumped him out of 28-day cycle so heat but he told Abraham he said in that 28-day cycle no worse this time cycle of life you have a child so it's Tara knew that she would she had to be changed back as I'm sure she was not having periods at ninety years old so see she had to get a revelation and go this is it you see the bride's the same way the bride's got to have a revelation got to hear from what dot in human flesh and then and then believe for herself that she got she one perceived what strength now wasn't it Saturday and put on her jogging you know jogging dress and go jogging and no it was her faith she said okay finally remember she was there when she was the one that said let's try the tango come on oh I can't produce we've been having relations from you know 40 50 60 years and nothing's happened but Hagar here you take her remember she gave Hagar to Abraham great room and then she got mad he got mad why because she could conceive how many time to be read in history where that's happened even with Solomon's time where the one produced the child but the other one stole it it's happened to me even even in modern times the woman can't have a child but she winds up stealing one from the hospital or something so a woman gets kind of jealous if she can't produce basically when you got a Abram standing there going you know I chosen of God God's talking to this man you know and leading them through this journey but she comes to a place here though where it narrows down that's what we're doing now we're narrowing down there's only one bride there's not there's not a bride out there there's a bride and that's the bride of Jesus Christ under the message to the out under Malachi 4 message under the Malachi 4 new birth according to Malachi 40 new birth according to Melancon 4 is this message what might allow on your heart yeah sure what takes the nervousness away it takes all these Tibetan but you you you know you're born to be a mother and thank God we still got them don't hear the other day that the population of the world is going down because of two things one is famine and nothing was what homosexuality there's so much rampant homosexuality till there's no there we gap of the generations because kind of go home you're right they won't be none left they don't judge him faithful to that promise alright so she believed that's a woman believing God you and I are all women in the body of Christ so we are the same as Sarah see that's the big thing one though Tim and I were talking about you know especially in the message we separate this thing you know you're dog meat because brother Brown said you love me he didn't say you have done me he said their dog me and bro friend was a well I was listening to him the other day and man he said you know he said the only woman that put on makeup maybe was talking to what were you hearing him I think what word was I'm listening he said you know think she got eat my dog now if you see a woman with makeup whom you just walk up to her and say oh you don't see them thank God that was way back when you never told me I would say last week I was talking to my friend but you gotta remember listen brother branham probably regretted saying that in his humanity but remember that he will have the spirit of Elijah and that spirit of Elijah cording to want to preach to you a while back about the the lives of ministry was to two women he knew how to handle two women he like a lot said John the Baptist brother Brown and the two witnesses they're gonna deal with two or what two different churches and that's exactly what brother Brown had to do with he was dealing with the bolts and the tree he was trying to get the boss to see the tree mm-hmm jump dear someday but to say that that was the Elijah spirit because look at look at Elijah and Elijah all the things that they called down on people why did it Elijah go run back in the cabin and hide itself I'm getting the Bell when he condemned her really he condemned her but we remember brother Brown said when that I'm not and lifted off of him he goes back into cave you know Jezebel said I'll cut your head off another word well that's the same way we aren't but the anointing you can say some things even brother Dale says something though the cloth said one time he said man I just heard everybody's head roll and before me brother Dale said something it just you know kind of a tent off these and I heard something hit the floor and roll he said it must have been people hey it but you just have to say things like that because we're listening were sheep why does the sheep Shepherd have a shepherd's hook why didn't he just do this no he's got a staff and that hook is to reach and grab them around the neck and pull them out on the street or wherever they're at and take the other end and whack them in the head with it so we're sheep we have to be laying all over them and therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead from a hurry for him see Road children Abraham Abram and Sarah Sarah I had zero children but I promised them told Abraham said look down can you count the grains of sand look up can you count start said your people what is that big listen when he sat down as many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable right these all died in faith not having received the promises now what is the promise is that this is where we get into another contention of people believe in the people in the Old Testament has a new birth there's no one promise and the promise of the Holy Ghost can be in your soul acts 2:38 the Pentagon I've named you Jesus Christ for the making you Cynthia showers you can get the gift of the Holy Ghost for the walk the promise is to you all right so they didn't receive the promises they were under an anointing in the Old Testament not a new birth for David would have done when he did he was a murderer and an adulterer Darnay wipe that out same way with even great everyone have quality even Solomon did one of the greatest man that ever would both wise man in the world at the end of his life he led two women turning into idolatry so because they didn't have a new birth when God's anointing lifted off of them they were just Moses killed an Egyptian he did a lot of things wrong according does but when God looks a boy on my justification these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off never brother Brown said every prophet desire to see this day this day you're living in right now even all the Old Testament prophesied of this day Jeremiah specially seen many times he talks about the latter day and I think I got one for we'll read he talks about in the latter day you'll understand these things so they were all looking toward and in but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them what knowing that we would come knowing that we would fulfill these promises and embrace them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth what a great thing they died under the blood of bulls and goats but knowing that somebody is going to grab this thing and resurrect them out of the ground right but they are they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country all right no no not a integral business you understand United States now there's one thing for sure we'll try to get into a little bit today maybe maybe part two of this foundation you got to remember two things about that seventy weeks never forget this it says to thy people and thy holy city two things not just two people God's promised them like brother Brown said right there where Abraham took communion with Melchizedek is where the new thing I don't know about the new city not the millennium that's temporary the new city is right I was right up under their feet and it's gonna push up and the bride's gonna sit down on it on the future in the future so there is the land part that God thanks so much of that place we're going back to it all of us are we're all going to Jerusalem do you ain't end up all right so remember 970 weeks you got to cover the people and the city so there's got to be a people restored and a city restored or physical theory if they say that such things declare plainly that they seek the country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to that turn now you gotta remember it's not just the physical place from them me and you we got to remember where we come from where we take this land because when c21 a new birth comes the true new birth wipes out your old birth now done well we went through it oh you sisters are going to do what no you had the baby but once you had that baby and once you got reborn or rebirth you that's not your kid anymore your God stop right because they've been mindful attention from whence they came out they might have that opportunity to return but now they desire a better country that isn't heavenly so it's not a not unearthly part in songs or heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city where in the Millennium which will be to the Jews there will be a city there because remember the walls had to be even rebuild gird Ezrin kneel by the physical city was rebuilt then it was poured out again by in eighty seventy by titus and they were dispersed again see there's several dispersions of israel not just one we're going to talk about one today we're going to disperse them to let the land rest well he did in AD 70 he promised even Daniel 9:25 he said the French will come in other words desolation and he'll just tear the place apart alright so we're gonna look at that and see that what but see what's God doing even your brother Brown see God's bringing them back to Israel right under Eichmann and Hitler those two hundred thousand thousand demons were reigning them back to the Israel why because he's not going to deal with them he promised him he'd deal with them in their homeland only not or else he's not doing with Israel in the nation in America no he's going to deal with them when they all get back to what a physical city but remember I still going to be even our future home as a physical city it's not some fairy tale and as ego 42 44 is the Millennial temple was going to be built a true temple because you got to restore the people and the city right but now they desire a better country that isn't heavenly where our God is not ashamed to be called their done for he has prepared for them a city then we go to Abraham by faith Abraham when he was tried now this is after the promise he got of the Sun he got the Sun here then God said go take him out and kill him now remember I even had a lot of wisdom he didn't tell Sara any 11 he was very wise by not telling Sarah that by faith Abraham Lee was trying to offered up Isaac and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten Son then went with Christ gave His only begotten Son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called see paper hell didn't have a quote book or a Bible to read he had to believe what God told him at first and he stood on that and said hey if he give me this child he changed my body he changed my life buddy he changed her womb and he gave me this child killing her not he's got a raised something he's not bring something back to fulfill fulfilled the promise all right something Abraham just walks up there and he grabs a knife and he said okay good but remember what happened he's a mistake of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up I think understood now even from the dead from whence also he received his in a figure by fate's Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the things to come by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph did their bringing a lineage down both the sons of Joseph in worship they didn't want the top of his saddle now who was the both of the sons of Joseph there from the Monessen right excuse me now it's the two sons of Joseph excuse me and worship leaning upon the top of the staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel that hurricane not gonna hit Florida you know we got some money we got some new guys well the new Hunt Club that we're in a lot of them live in Central Florida they're all lineman's they works with Lu houer company and they were they call they call the Senate tax and there's even guys they're not Christians at all by domain but they were just telling the team Anna that maybe a month before they can start hunting because they I think time to cross Florida at a category-5 the way they thought it was it was going to go right Florida and it would just they'd be working from Christmas so what we done was is I just didn't look I'm gonna pray the job will be safe and you'll have you know how to not have that many problem what I didn't realize then it just I was working yesterday but no day for yesterday I driving down the road and the thought comes to me there's believers down there on the East Coast we're going to ganged up and I just started calling brother jacked up brother let's go brother smiley and deep brown and then that church in Jacksonville that y'all are going to to preach out that's all on the East Coast I said god I forgot I'm sorry I forgot about your children I said just turn that thing and I said turn it side you know and I want to be honest with you I said turning south because that's Key West and down that way I really I mean you know you just you said I said that typically think about the last word nothing well no or how it just you know direct that thing away I didn't even think he was gonna turn it right turn Clyde and take it right up the coast and they ain't I mean that thing went like this and it's both flew across Florida this thing now it's turning and going straight up 175 my line when you made me to bet his coat the Florida a lot of people would die being way sometimes it did die he knows what we need we may say things immense every once in a while but he knows I didn't even think about turning them out into the Atlantic Ocean then just let it fill the way out so [Music] he's in Florida see they didn't know about that something so God's a good gun he's going to turn that thing in if they hit some it's just going to be a little bit of water and ten and everything will be okay yeah oh my goodness lady they need to just they're on the other side of them if they from Fort st. Joe on the other side but you know what I was thinking you know what the devil's a song you can't stop that hurricane nobody nobody nobody can stop a hurricane I said heavenly they I thought saying he created you he created the ground we walk on and that God all he has to do is say peace be still and you know one day category five hurricane would just be really pretty clouds and it would be distributing just speaking water so you speak the word sometimes I can't think about humanity but think about the believers think about the believers that were in that ma'am go jacked up it was gonna hip West Palm Beach and I mean that would be a direct hit here up there with Long Beach do anyway just think about that God's mindful always thing that we asked for but you know what sometimes you get desperate though when you start asking you think God please not though believers right there on the cover you know much less the ones that are handling you know romantic statement and I'll live there on the other side I would just talk about the ones coming in from this side if everything hit was 175 mile an hour winds they said environment is just gonna wipe it off so if he's got believers in the Bahamas Lord we pray that you will turn that thing again and give it away ice only God week there's only one God to serve they can take that away all these other guys are totally inferior we have accounting that God was able to raise him up well let's go down here by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Ephraim gave commandment concerning his bones the Joad of dead one what did Joseph or Joseph was a perfect type of Christ he wanted his bones carried to Jerusalem he might have died in Egypt but he wanted to be buried in Jerusalem comes like brother Brown said several times he said Joseph knew where the Christ was coming he knew the resurrection was going to come in through something he wanted to be later where he could be resurrected not out there somewhere else all right that's really good so let's get right here but my faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child in other words he wouldn't know better than that rest but there was a promise between Joc abandoned homes dr. Banton that was two up anyway they were not afraid of the Kings commandment but though I came to him and told him they were going to have town three months of his parents because they saw that the proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment what was the king's commandment kill all the babies under two years old right by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter the same way with you and I you you refused to become what Pharaoh was Egypt that's the world so we are not anymore by the new birth we are not anymore children of Egypt are children of Pharaoh Pharaoh being the devil any more be born again choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season that's what we come out of and listen you need to be careful that that last part in that spirit part don't lean you back toward and it will they don't you pray for me that will lead you back to the world every day but remember you had better suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for season why would you want to be complicated with believers if there's not something inside of you that knows that if you're in a crowd of grumps and Clare serves and whoremongers and you want to be there with them sometimes we have to walk through but if you want to go be with that group you need a new birth if you're not if you're not comfortable if you're not comfortable with the people of God you got a problem you're not born again just remember I'm real comfortable with my family my other family members that's right okay I don't get nervous when I preach the reason I don't get nervous cuz I'm freaking to my family members okay so it just it helps me to know that that I've talked into my family yeah I'm not talking to strangers oh we might not know each other personally from humanity but in our in our inside I will talk about this this past weekend but inside of you there's a kindred spirit the Bible talks about a kindred spirit now I mean Bob may not have a kindred spirit though he don't like the mutton I do so man him can't sit there and calm about deer hunting but when I say God stands he he we all perk up because see that that's something that wasn't the inside mammals we talked about I kind of so much said one time said what he's saying is something you don't like if you don't like the hunt pillow Saturday go and all of that but in mama deer hunter are you people in doha y'all standing y'all doing something wrong let's see what i'm and so saying is something you don't like you don't like that's why that's why we need to be careful and y'all shoulda listened to what Louie said and what brother George plan and then we're talking about criticizing so many people you know why you criticize them cuz there's something you don't like you don't mean it's wrong you know that is correct and we talked about that this weekend - we have a situation where we kind of all got together Sunday after church between the two churches that are up there Kentuckian and God are talking about and one girl spoke up and said well I I'm just going to tell it like we should stay at Google said then she said I can't bring my friends to church because every time I bring them to church she's a schoolteacher and they have short hair and their rings and probably put on some makeup Brenda her friend does yeah no not the other girl she's a real good godly little girl but she's trying to bring the church she said every time I bring them to my turn she said the preacher preached at home hey are you asking close I said you bring them to Lula you will that won't happen I've seen many times my bad at tape the Lord take my dad and just weave it over there and talk to them people and then we come right back and talk all of us and we write back and never never make a never may Idaho and don't let them feel left bring people here and make them feel left out or feel isolated now listen don't come to turn to your seat Suites from that that's right okay I like that I like that statement self-timer of church from Nanjing got married says coming to you are they ought to put a sign down there though that says but don't leave as you were so you come as you are you and you gotta they got start somewhere because you don't want so did you so they come as you are but listen let's don't beat them that fire but not me out that's kind of strange that that happens now that we're supposed to be up here with some kind of brotherly kindness it still happens it and we've said been setting in beans and I'm gonna okay you want to commune the preacher was but preacher told me personally there's a woman came in it was a fellowship meeting she said now in the front row shouldn't sit somewhere else but she got there early short hair she was a Pentecostal lady a real short hair and that preacher everybody could have just left he said her he told me he said now God would not what do you think God wouldn't be pleased if I didn't speak on that I thought you know dude yeah you're wrong buddy wrong bad wrong oh I didn't tell you to do that okay so just throw that out for a little tidbit somebody comes in but they feel welcome right man so we'll get it next week or two weeks yeah I don't next week we'll be here we'll talk about by faith Moses when he come here for views with the Carlos underbarrel as part of our journey but I said I'm not the son of Charles an elf or any of you they'll be reborn
