the lord amen brother dale you want to go ahead and come up i think that we have a baby dedicated so we're going to go ahead and amen great thing to dedicate a baby yes because you dedicate them to the lord but you dedicate yourself to help raise the baby that's the main thing right put it all there all right what if we would if the brewer family and the gabriel family we'll come on down to the front and we'll have the baby dedication just come on down now both sides all right what we're going to do is going to be hey there hey beautiful going to be a little bit different come on wait come on it's going to be a little bit different because you know we all love brother ray and everybody in the church always loved and praised brother ray and you know so we just want somebody to stand in his place today is that all right to where we can say okay we're all a part of the body of christ amen but we're just glad to be able it's a hard time and all that we know but yet still it is a time that we can take the time and we can this do this that they would have been months maybe years before they could ever got over to our dedicated because we've been looking forward to this little one we always like to get those little ones to the lord as fast as we can because that way then we have you know we can take take pride and honor in knowing that all is well and god can take care of all things amen so that's what we want to do we want to bring the little one bring it to the lord so let's just sing that bring him in and we'll bring the the little one and we'll just dedicate her unto the lord now remember what we do here we're just a little bit different i guess in all of our doings but you see everybody in the building today is dedicating this baby not just me not the family on both sides we're all gathered together to dedicate this little one all right because we are to live before this child a life that the child can look up and see and won't follow after i want to do that because that way you can dedicate then see you dedicating yourself to live before this child that it would have an honor and glory to look back at the lives of the christian saints that's gathered and that way the families that dedicate their lives to live before this child a life that christ can come down and live in the family and do that all right okay so let's just dedicate the little one little let's see i better make sure i get this right now my wife said you make sure and get that right little violet ray [Music] wow you're heavy the lord jesus christ father we bring this little one into our hands you and your word there you talked about it they brought their little ones to you and you dedicated them you committed them to god that's what we're doing today we just committed with this little one back into the hands of mom and daddy grandmothers and things to raise the child for your honor and your glory we love you and we thank you thank you for an opportunity little babies lord as long as they're little babies they've got a right to heaven in your ways we love you father and we thank you we commit it all down to your bring the little [Music] oh i need to turn it on how's that that good good thank you sir always good to get a thumbs up from the back row good to be in the house with the lord good to see each and every one of you here lord i mean that how many's downstairs a few rhymes you'll feel your youngest downstairs you can bring them up here anytime you want to good to be here today good to have that service there with uh good to see mary and lord we remember them when they were just uh babies themselves and downstairs if y'all want to look at some of the older stuff in 2001 there's two um scrapbooks downstairs where in 2001 we had a we had a youth meeting here a youth weekend and it went quite well shaving cream got everywhere boyd's hair was white because of shaving cream and uh some of the younger ones are there if you want to look at it you can see even sister trudy mcmillan we have she here oh you ought to see it sister look good with shaving cream all over your head but we had a good time and it just reminded me that everybody's grown up i mean amy was a lord amy was a little young teenage girl where does that time go that's that's been 20 years ago from 2001 to 2021 that's been 20 years ago that we did that but uh thank god that that we can still talk about it and we can see each one still here and we see the fruits of of maybe the labor that that brother dale had a burden for the young kids at even at that time and have a burden for them now so god bless you remember after the service we'll have cake and ice cream downstairs after we get finished and brother bob will be speaking wednesday night may the first we're going to start back with bible study that will be may the first at six o'clock i know some of you are going to be gone but we will have a bible study starting may the 1st and then may the 9th which will be the following sunday we will have our sunday school classes back together again downstairs like we usually do okay is everybody all right with that 9 45 we'll start with our sunday school classes at 9 45 on sunday morning amen also remember june the 17th 18th and 19th we're going to have i didn't announce this but let me announce this now since we're leaving on wednesday to go up there we're going to have church on tuesday the 16th i think that's i think that's right but anyway the tuesday of that week we'll be having sunday service on tuesday afternoon or tuesday evening and not our wednesday night because we're going one day extra this year give the kids more time to fish and play and get muddy and dirty and all those other things that they do so and brother chris long and brother ronnie long will be here we'll have service on sunday we'll be coming back saturday about lunch and they'll be speaking for us on sunday also remember july 3rd and 4th will be our 50th anniversary meeting brother joel forney will be preaching saturday evening and brother mike ulti will be preaching sunday morning and we'll have a catered dinner after that amen so and also remember and i know that um they've already posted it marrying them on facebook and on the different things emails that you know about brother ray's memorial service will be next saturday i think the service actually starts at 1 30 but you can get there a little early and have some some time of fellowship and and and sister mary i i'll have to find out tomorrow if i can be there saturday i had originally took off tried to take off yesterday but since it's going to be next saturday i don't know the guy the lady i subbed for she's got a wedding that saturday so we'll see so you just pray but brother dale's doing the funeral anyway so y'all just show up just be there amen and support for the family we love them with the love of the lord we miss brother ray and we miss uh i miss he's got he has one phrase that always he said you know what i mean he'll just be talking away and he's saying know what i mean at least most of the time we didn't know what he was meaning some people say that and you really don't know what you know what i mean no i really don't the brother ray you knew what he meant he loved the lord and he loved this message he loved the church here love brother dale and you know what we're going to talk a little bit about that like as we did last wednesday about perfect love so we'll start with the this will be the plan part 15 today we're going to look at the chart a little bit to show us where we're at and i'll be giving those out but brother joe will be putting it up on the on the screen so we're going hebrews 9 11 9 verse 11. let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father thank you for this day that we're living in the hour that you give us to be here lord we pray now that you would be the active participant in this service lord you do the speaking you're the only one who can do the revealing father because without you here lord it's just a meeting lord as the prophet said that denominationals have just come to where it's a meeting of a lodge lord we don't want a lodge meeting today we want a meeting with the power of the holy ghost being in each our of our lives and if someone is not empowered with the holy ghost we pray that today during this service that you'll drop down as in the book of acts while the word was being preached the holy ghost fell on the people we pray that you would heal the sick lord sanctify us for this journey that we're on it's been a long journey lord but i believe it's coming to an end and father i pray that you would be with each one lord it's not here be the ones that are sick brother danny sister joyce sister hope the different ones lord fighting the covet we pray that you'd be with them lord all the older ones that are not here today too we pray that you'd be with them just touch each one of us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit bless this day lord in jesus name amen hebrews 11 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place and here's our thought that we've been known for now 15 sermons having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord as blessing he has obtained eternal redemption because remember in this plan of redemption jesus christ was almighty god but he was living in a body that was not eternal he was living in a body that was brought here by god but once it came into this dimension it had to be our brother he had to be able that flesh had to be able to die for our sins because we couldn't have a spirit die for us because spirits don't die amen spirits don't die so we had to have a man but that plan started before the foundation of the world and we've been talking about it and we'll read it in just a minute in ephesians again but let's go to first john 4 verse 16 because we're heading toward this part of perfect love and uh i hope you enjoyed wednesday night i enjoyed and sometimes you enjoy preaching things and sometimes you don't and i know ministers know that but i enjoyed wednesday night myself and i know a lot of you did because you get good comments from it you know you give the handclap to the lord because he's the one that gave it to you amen but watch this and we have known and believed the love of god that one more time believe the love that god hath to us now remember there is no lesser form of love in god except agape love right everybody got that there is no less reform god does not have filial love because filio love he'd be wishy-washy and agape love is you say oh see we have we have traded agape love with greasy grace and you can get by whatever you want to because god's a good god you got to remember one thing god is a judge he is a righteous judge he does not do things frivolously he does not make decisions that are wrong so to be a righteous judge though this love that he has for us this agape love is not what you're feeling towards your wife and towards your family and even towards your pastor that's feel your love agape love the only way you can really experience agape love is to be born again no other way you can't understand it because that's what's happening now is the world as bob and i were talking a few minutes ago the world has traded all that though for do you know if you're if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul if you don't have the new birth today you do not have agape love you're just living under filial love so the denominational world anybody that's not born again anybody that's even a foolish virgin has not experienced and never will experience agape love only the bride brother brown talked about the quote and i didn't bring it before brother brown says only the bride will have what true faith true true faith which makes perfect faith makes perfect love so the bride will only be the only ones that know and you say well how how do you know that well even the bible tells us the saints will judge the earth now listen you're going to judge the earth by perfect love that you have you're not going listen by filial love if you walk to the white throne judgment with filial love everybody will get in right nobody's going to see you see how the devils took that though and nobody's going to hell anymore they can just do away with it because nobody's going to hell everybody's going to heaven because they're all good people yeah hell's going to be full of good people i would say a lot of message believers but i'm not going to go there and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us look god is love and he that dwelleth in love now look dwelleth not just know about it every once in a while not just to think about it every once in a while but if you dwell in love you dwelleth in god and god in you or him talk about me us you herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of what see that word judgment you have to bring judgment into agape love amen you see there in the boldness and the day of judgment because there's only way you can be a judge is to have agape love right because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment now we've been going through this whole world about a year's worth of just people being scared of their shadow people being scared to come to church scared to even breathe when are we going to get out of that he that feareth is not made perfect let me read that one more time he that feareth is not made perfect in love i'm just reading bible and that's not my quote that's not brother brown's quote that's the bible all right that's the bible we love him because he first what predestinated by foreknowledge that we would love him he loved us first that's what we've been talking about that before the foundation of the world god by foreknowledge knew who would and who wouldn't love him so he made a place and a way for us to get to this direction for the ones that don't love him to get to this direction and i'll read you a scripture here in a few minutes where jesus says depart from me i never knew you oh have i not cast out devils have i not preached this message have i not oh i've done all these i i i me me he said depart from me i never knew you and that word new is not just k-n-e-w like i knew this brother right here no we'll get to that in a minute there's no fear and love but perfect love castes out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first love us so you see he had to project his love first because all we knew all we know down here is filial love that's all we know is feel your love as a human being everybody got that because i remember i read you that quote until the sunday i mean wednesday night read it real quick and then we'll get back to it brother brown says what is that well i'll get to it in a minute but remember he says you don't love you can't have agape love with your natural body your natural body has filial love your spirit realm is where you love memory reason conscious affection imagination that affection in that second realm is not godly perfection i mean whatever you want to call it love right or affection inside the soul then though is dot is not filial love it's either agape love or it's lust unbelief inside your soul you say oh i don't lust after that hang on a minute i'm telling you these people that preach the gospel heal the sick cast out devils raise the dead and they're going to hell because they didn't get perfect love in their soul they got it on their spirit realm so much until they thought that was the holy ghost that's why that we contend in this church and and as many as i know the fellowships with us we believe in getting born again amen we believe in a life-changing experience we believe that the things i used to do i do them no more amen why you've been made perfect in love now sure you're gonna have a fight outside you're gonna have a fight in that sec in that second realm i didn't say it was all pieces and cream no that's where you're gonna have your fight but listen if you're born again today your soul has no fight it has already been victorious and it's not it's not it's not the it's not the love of god yet it is but it is god it's not i love my no it is god if god is love read it right there god is love and that love where's god at today if you're born again he's not a second or third person of a trinity he's only one person and he is by the baptism of the holy ghost he has him morphine himself into you to give you that perfect love and that's where the fear should be cast out let me read you a quote now they don't have this one but i'll watch this right here you don't have to look for it and here you hear him though in 1956 brother brown said see salvation is not based upon what someone else thinks it's what you think of him divine healing isn't based on what the critics say or what the church says it's based on your perfect faith he didn't stop your perfect faith in the inspired word of god so you've got to hear an inspired word of god to even have faith as brother they'll talk about this morning we need apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists because god saw that that's what we need god saw that that's what we needed an inspired word of god coming from a fivefold ministry and i know we all believe that and then brother brown says look it's based on your perfect faith in the inspired word of god and how you're inspired to believe it that's what brings the results is your inspiration by the word so what are you based on feeling emotion gifts no you're based on the word then it brings all those things it's like we were talking about this about wednesday night you know i think the problem with that we've still been here is is because of one thing we have majored brother brown said on a miner we've majored on a minor if you want to to help you understand that like i was saying before if you want to be a doctor if zach's going to become a doctor just for those of you that weren't here and those of you that were asleep wednesday night at least you'll wait for a little while right now praise the lord so anyway so you're going to be a doctor all right now what courses you're going to have to take well i need to take woodworking i need to take electricity i need to learn how to crayon in between my lines i need to learn sports uh now that's part of the curriculum but that's not gonna make him a doctor he can do some of these elective courses that's fine but his core courses are gonna be biology chemistry anatomy of the body how to cut somebody open how to sew somebody up that's the same way in the message of the hour we majored on all these minor that's it folks that's why we've been here 50 or 60 years we've majored on the electives and not majored on what the prophet told us he said it would take those seven unknown thunders it would take the seals to be open for us to even understand anything the real message of the hour now listen when i say the real message of the hour there's not that's not saying that the rest of it's false but you have to build now listen those electives have to be there and they will help that person but it will never get zach the degree now what is my degree in your degree a body change our degree is not by and by i'll see you because i got to die ours is standing on earth and literally death the prophet said would crawl up your sleeve and you would say no reverse the process you will say no way that's not going to happen to me so but then you you say well now all right zach you want to be a doctor i don't care if you do or not just say yes you want to be a doctor now i got this hurting right here in my back you want to come in here and cut me open and now he's going to be a doctor why can't he do that he's going to have the experience he's got to have some experience behind his belt that's what we've been having for 50 years we've been having but listen they put all their experience on this over here yeah and there was a time when we needed that we needed that like brother they were talking about the hair and the dress and living right and but you know what if you're born again if you're born again of the spirit of god a preacher should never have to tell you how to dress they got it all wrong yeah i'll clap myself they got it all wrong they're over here beating you up trying to get you to line up when if you got them born again by the prophet of god tells me that a holy ghost-filled woman will never put on never put on a pair of pants holy ghost-filled woman never cut her hair the bible tells you that it's an abomination for you to cut your hair so why do i have to keep rehashing all that read your bible but if you get born again something inside of you then your spiritual rudder is going to take you away from that oh i don't know if i can get to church or not i don't know didn't brother brown say christians went to church but filio love says well my cat's sick i'm gonna say that one more time my cat's sick filio love says i need to stay home with my kitty hmm or you know put whatever you want to in there you know i got to stay home because of because and i've seen people you know and i i'm going to tell you one more time we got people that you know my kids you know hannah was here a few minutes ago praise the lord at least maybe she got a little something y'all should have sprinkled something on top of her while she was here but i'm not going to compromise what i have and stay home because she's home i'm not going to have my kids come in and dictate what i do in my house as far as going to church june's dad he now it was probably the devil motivating him but a lot of times he'd show up on a saturday night or show up on a friday night you know and hang around for a little while and but you got to set an example i don't know why i'm going here but i'm going this way anyway but you got to set an example you got to say i'm going to church if you want to meet me you either go to church with me or you can sit right here and play with my dog until we get back toby will take care of that he'll take care of you and we'll come back but see they're they're waiting to see what you are going to do about it and a lot of times we fail should be church first beyond anything else should be your should be your like i tell you before i i know sister brewer and and and little sister brewer um they know the message so i'm not preaching to them but you know you get somebody walking in the door that's brand new and they come in and you know they haven't been around a message because what it shows their fruit show but brother dale's up here just hammering away and then all of a sudden he goes down that little pathway about water baptism or or god sent a prophet or or something like that and we just sat around like we're like stones on the river yeah right but you know what that's going to project to that person that person's going to say that i don't believe what he's saying and then people must not either no you should more try listen try your best to get out of nod for a little while and at least brother dale or somebody preaching up here and a new person walks in you ought to say that ain't nothing but the truth that's what we live on that's what we survive on we don't survive on a trinity we don't survive how in the world can we do that how can we survive on the trinity knowing what you know now how can you survive on uh you know what you got inside to use the third person of a trinity how can you do that you can't do that not if you're born again i'm telling you again one more time let that thing out you got people let it out and even if you're demon possessed let it out get get the holy ghost and then let him out let him work listen he ain't you'd say why not here you go giving away the holy ghost now you're never going to do that you're going to try to i try to give my eternal life to everybody i see that wants to listen amen because you're not going to be able to give it away if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen that's pretty powerful that's why there's a lot of people have this projection of what god is and what he looks like and what his purpose is and it's false he's not the third person of the trinity he didn't create an eternal hell he didn't tell us to be baptized in the name of father son holy ghost you understand what i'm saying but now all the world is over here under this filial love because listen anything you hear that is contrary to the word of god is comes under filial love you can't preach a false doctrine and it be agape love so if you're preaching a false doctrine or you believe in a false doctrine you have not received that perfect love or that agape love because that is the love of god that isn't the love of god now the bible says projected but remember it's not projected like on a screen when god projects his love he takes his love and puts it inside of you and then that reacts to what he is that's why you sit here in a church service and you don't react maybe there's nothing to react with try it sometime try to react sometimes you've tried the other way long enough nobody's went out the door yet so we're good i said yet if i do and we'll get aaron to go stand he can p he can cover both doors god pulls a lot of weight in this message ephesians 1 verse 4. he's the only one i can say that to and get by with it okay according as he has chosen us in him let's go to the underlying part before the foundation of the world that's what we've been talking about this whole plan of if it was an eternal plan of redemption it wasn't developed just well i got to do something no god before the foundation world this has all been settled he knew you were going to be here today and he knew that if you weren't going to be here and people look at me cross-eyed sometimes when they say i really enjoyed your sermon today and i said i really enjoyed you being here to enjoy my sermon today because there's a lot of people wanting here to enjoy right accordingly has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love then we talked about predestination unto the adoption of children now brother dale's been on adoption we're going to read a quote here on that i'm going to read from the adoption series so there must be a call that we were talking about something the other day and listen sure there's a call to be born again there's a call these different calls are going out but the call in this end time it narrows down the prophet to god says it's a narrow and that narrow way is adoption we're never going to come to the body change without someone somebody some not group individual coming to a place where death is destroyed in that person while they're still alive that's what our call is yeah it's our call to to preach on this and to preach on the holy ghost and preach on how to get it i believe we've been doing that but there comes a time where zach is going to be a a surgeon now he's going to take four years of college two years of extra stuff and another four years of internship yeah okay and then when he gets to the last part of his internship and he gets ready to take his test to be a doctor he's gonna say i forgot to learn how to spell i i got to go back you see what i mean no he learned how to spell he has went through the development stages he knows and has when he gets that certificate that certificate is what it shows that he has took a required course now our certificate is the message of the hour the head teachers already come and give us what we need to get that certificate what are we doing with it esther got a certificate the other day good girl take your hand go out like this go you did good that's great she did to be a dental hygienist right huh then what's this stuff yeah well did you just get they just sent you that right i mean you don't have to do nothing for it what did you pay a couple dollars huh oh i worked hard for that thing well guess what pretty adamant about that wasn't she you studied long hours you went to church you read your bible you prayed everybody got what i'm saying shifting it over to us being christians how in the world can be we be christians and not know who our father is not know what to do and what to look at and what to read right see that goes back to why would i want i wouldn't want a surgeon come in they said boys the best surgeon ever was here but this dude can't read what do you mean he can't read how did he become a surgeon well he just paid a couple hundred dollars and we showed him how to cut up a cat and we're he's ready to go well that's the way we've been if you're not born again if you've just been playing around with this message all this time and you're not went up the statue of perfect man and you're not showing any kind of any brotherly kindness or anything else that's exactly what you've done you've bought yourself a degree under filial love not agape love yeah because under agape love god will take you and teach you through apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists and you sisters talking to your other sisters and each one talking to us each other about the word of god that puts us in line for this adoption because if you're born again you're all in line for adoption but it's not immediate everybody got that well there's already been listen you received the spirit of adoption inside that spirit that you get there is a way a prescription a curriculum that will get you there but now what does brother brown say he says now looking look if you grieve the holy ghost now you're not going to lose him that's right but he's going to go out on a limb now listen you're not going to do something wrong and god's going to go no i don't think i'm going no you know what he does he just lets you suffer a little bit he lets you go through some dry places every once in a while he lets you go god where are you you know what he's going to do he's a good god he's going to say you know what he said um you said a certain thing to this brother one time i'm talking about experience i said something about this certain brother one time and you need to get that took care of them now listen you can either get that took care of or you're gonna meet that on the other side and you're never gonna move past that spot right there that's why i called that brother up i said something about him and i call him up and apologize to him i was wrong yeah you know what that done like a revival phone call didn't cost a dime and it wasn't but about 15 minutes and after we got done he said well brother wait he said you've come up this way we go that way to illinois he said just call me and come preach preach for me any time see what i mean but that thing see it wasn't on him it was on me i'm the one that said it right so you be careful about belittling people and yakking about people and yeah be careful you'll never you'll never go past that point right trust me you'll walk around in dry places for a while why because the holy ghost says well you're still my child now listen i'm in adoption right you're still my child but what brother brown said he said oh but your child is acting up remember the holy ghost he's telling examples that the holy ghost goes to the father and says now not you but your child is acting a little acting up you know what he's going to do he's going to make you pay for it because brother dale says you know if bastard child can't take correction well the bastard child was born on the filial level bastard child is not born under gothic love agape love has nothing to do with sex desire has nothing to do with how we got here nothing to do with any of that that's what got us in trouble because we stepped over into filial love which rolls like a ball down to lust and all them other things we're going to read it in just a second but listen to this real quick get off that for a minute bro bob you don't talk to me tomorrow adoption series let's go well we've read this before we have redemption listen thank god for redemption listen thank god for grace and it's not greasy grace see greasy grace is a grandpa that lets you get by amen diana uh-huh she's shaking the head or if you only knew but in whom we have redemption through his blood what the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now what is grace given to us for grace is not given to us for stuff we're fiction to do right it's for your past amen because if you say it's for what's in front of me then you just go do to the go to the priest in the catholic church and say forgive me father for i'm going to i'm going to sin tomorrow i'm going to kill three people. that's why the mob loves to be catholic they're going to forgive and he'll just do the whatever he does and they're forgiven well you can't get forgiven for something you haven't done yet right that's not grace but listen what about a god though that will check you before you do it if you got agape love he's obligated to do that right he's obligated to put that little pen in your heart that says bear not go that way but now of course sometimes we do anyway so let's go to the next quote quote number one now he said this is from adoption because remember back in ephesians we saw where um i'm going to read it don't go back to it that we that what has having made known unto us the mystery of his will all right so this age and this end time is the only time that we know the full mystery of the will of god the full mystery of redemption not just as we're saved and we're sanctified and we're filled with the holy ghost and we're going to live a good life and we're going to pass away but we know where we're going and we'll be back and and all those things that's fine but i thought adoption had something to do with authority where you have authority over things all right so listen so now he made known unto us the mystery get the holy ghost on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes this afternoon i had all about 30 minutes to study just to look the lesson over maybe not i'm not i'll say half of that 15 minutes and i got to run it and i thought the mystery how mysterious and the scripture packed me back into the old testament then back over into the new testament tied something together see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together us not another age we've already seen all that's not a mystery anymore that mystery is history we know what martin luther came under we know what john wesley came under we know what the pentecostals came under but do we know what we came under see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together remember it cannot be caught in any seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world look waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god listen tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now listen there's been great things happen but a lot of that's been happening like see if under luther and under wesley they were still denominational i mean they weren't denominate listen they didn't denominate but their message was not fully complete their the mystery of the will of god is not that he's a trinity that's not the mystery of god the mystery is that they call it a trinity and he's one they the outside world the denominational world that's a mystery now look when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever a time in the history that this manifests the time to deliver all nature nature nature itself groaning waiting for the time of manifestation they're talking about now if you read them if you look on youtube and pull up some kind of earthquake i can't remember the name of it but this is one that's going to destroy california in about half of the united states they're already predicting it they're saying it's about 100 years overdue it came several thousand years ago and it's getting ready to come why is it always they always talk about california we had a prophet to tell us that that's exactly where that was going to happen amen so we already know what's going to happen we don't need somebody to give us a projection we know what's going to happen but it's going listen all nature anything that happens in nature i believe is that something's happening spiritual in the people do you think the natural is going to happen before the spiritual can't happen something in the spiritual world's got to happen first and then the natural will happen look why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation now let's stop right there just a second there couldn't have been manifestation in the old testament now let me let me caution you what brother brown is saying remember because there was manifestation in the old testament there was healings there were signs there was wonders but that was for them that was for them to get through their journey for them to get through their life that was for them to come to a place to where god could put them in paradise as we were talking about waiting but there's nobody had the whole package deal like we have they did not have the new birth in the old testament amen so they were working under an anointing of the agape love i said anointing of that agape love because that agape love couldn't go inside of them but they had manifestations but not like the one brother brown was fixing to talk about why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there that couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time why because we've got everything right we should have already been done with our electives we should know how to read we should be into our core classes and getting ready to graduate it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of god coming back in the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so he said them not we know brother brown was but he's gone off the scene he brought us what we needed he's gone off the scene so men ministers laity also don't throw it all on us we got a job to do but so do you the bible didn't say study to show your pastor approved this study to show yourself approved and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry now jesus christ didn't bring us let me rephrase that he brought us everything we need but when he preached those seals he sealed that thing back up until the end time so there's no way nobody could get it he preached the six seals in matthew 24 but nobody understood it he died at calvary come back on the day of pentecost but then there has to be a growth development i'm reading what brother brown said not in the old testament and not him in the early because they don't have the headstone shaping up to a headstone which is what the head message the headmaster is on the scene now the the one that the super surgeon that can teach you every little thing you need to know amen he's not just a one-year doctor this guy we're talking about is an eternal doctor until their ministry would be so close like christ till the what it'll join him and his church together that's not filial love has nothing to do with filial love it's all agape love it'll join him and his church together now remember we're going to skip through this but for the sake of the visitors let's look we know that for knowledge let's go to number two that we always in the message you hear people preaching that you always was eternal and you always was this and you all in the mind of god you sure were but down here you were not you were born in sin you were a huckleberg you were dead you were born dead like i read that scripture that it that we're supposed to joy at the going home of a saint and cry when a baby's born we get it totally backwards why cry when the baby's born because you're looking at death brother brown said that and he said you're looking at death when the baby's born because that person if not he's going to go through life and going to die because that's what our that kind of birth but now thank god for the new birth that was real weak thank god for the new birth damn that's the best thing you should ever had how can i take a cuckleberry and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it it's impossible for you to save your kids it's impossible for the pastor to save your kids but you can get them under the fountain enough and be enough of an example that they want i listen i wanted what he had he's my daddy i've got his characteristics i've got his dna running all through my body that's not what i wanted i got that whether i wanted it or not yeah you can prick your pick your friends but you can't pick your family so i was born in the same way born again of the spirit of god when you get born again spirit of god god can't deny you you're his child you have his dna but you still got to grow up you got to grow up so that somebody that died will be proud of us for the things that we do correct the only way it can be is because inside that cuckoo bird has been transmitted from a from a kokober wheat or a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life then you bury that kuckerberg and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in that kuckleberg you've got to be born again you can't just sit in a message church i'm going to read you a quote in just a few minutes you can sit here you can sit here forever and say oh i love brother branham and i love this message just sounds so good oh come on now that's greasy grace so god's going to give me eternal life just because i lack or our filio love him no that's not what he's after he's after he's after his own love his own life and so we we i don't want to go through the dimensions again but we know that we come up here to the sixth dimension so let's go all the way if you don't mind brothers to where it says perfect love number seven so we won't be here so long we can have a fellowship downstairs bring it take it to number seven brother joe please where it says perfect love quote number seven you're gonna have to skip you're gonna have to go through five to four dimensions to get there five dimensions so there you go now he said i believe i was caught up to the sixth dimension looking back there could see back see the sight isn't exactly the eyes it's earthly but sight is a greater than that the sight that they have their contact is far beyond contact that our natural senses would contact we can't imagine that but listen if you get a revelation from god you're pretty close because it doesn't do anything for these eyes it does your spiritual eye it opens your spiritual eye into your soul that teaches you how to go up that statue of perfect man that gives you revelation that the trinity is not right and then see we should that should be all gone we should now see a revelation to where yeah sure we always was eternal but when a preacher preaches it like we didn't have nothing to do with it and we just was pulled through a tube and you know we just got to believe the message and i saw the prophet and i saw this one and i fished with this one and i read 12 books and i've read 2 000 books and i've read the bible 300 times see what all that does is just paul said you can do all that and not have charity and you're a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol all those great look at caiaphas he stood there and i guarantee you caiaphas he knew he was a man of the hour because he was the he was the high priest he high priest meant he was the highest guy that could religious god on the earth at the time and he couldn't see that jesus christ was the son of god why because of the teaching that he'd come under the traditions didn't jesus tell him he said you've made these this tradition it's just tradition see if we made this even going to church if we made it just a tradition you know i said a minute ago you should be at church every time brother said every time a door opened you should be in church just saying but now you're saying well we don't have to go to church that's not what i'm saying you don't have to have a physical building to have a communion with god but you do need to come to church to have a better relationship with god everybody got that say amen wake up the ones beside you so they can say it too let's go to number eight i can't explain it this is when he went across the curtain of time let's go down there where it says and i said i don't understand this and the voice said this is perfect love said isn't that what you spoke the holy spirit was i said yes and this is perfect love where was he he was in the sixth dimension what did everybody in the sixth dimension have in common now remember they were blackheaded they were brown-headed they were they were blonds he said they were short they were tall he said the men had shaggy hair women had hair you know and had the robes on so that made them different right but they had one thing in common they had the new birth without the new birth you don't go into that sixth dimension so it doesn't matter see what i mean about all the electives and all the peripheral that doesn't matter until you get the new birth when you get the new birth that puts you in that place when god gives you the new birth he comes out of his dimension he's in the seventh right he comes out of his dimension and he gives you the new birth and that connects you with at least the sixth dimension because where's perfect love it resides in that sixth dimension and then what he just read this is perfect love so if you got perfect love that's what's connecting us with those people in that sixth dimension listen that's the reason that's the reason that even the bible without the bible i can see by revelation that somebody with perfect love is going to stand on this earth in a human body doesn't matter what the doctor says about you it doesn't matter what how age in the calendar you are doesn't make any difference they're going to stand on this earth and say death has been destroyed in this body because without that listen when jesus resurrected i like what somebody said and they preached a sermon on it and i can't remember who it was maybe danny steven a long time ago he said you know the resurrection message was not to dead people and a dead person can't give you the resurrection message a resurrection message has to be preached or spoken or shouted or trumpeted by a live human being in this dimension amen in this dimension not over there so we can't all get over there bob we'd be trapped somebody's got to have that same perfect love right here and listen folks that's the doctor that's the diploma you're looking for and you can get it because somebody's going to right right i like what my old football coach he said you either lead follow or get out of the way so i contend we got leaders and followers and we need to make sure we know where that's at but there's somebody who's going to bring us we know it's god almighty but he's going to bring it through the ministry because i just read to you what brother brown said a menace a group of people ministering the same message that jesus christ himself ministered on the face of the earth right amen it was so close to brother brown's time they thought he was god he said boy that's bad because i said well i told somebody the other day i said that's not too bad has anybody ever said you look like you god they said he's lived so close to god now we know he had a prophetic gift that you and i don't have but you know what we do have part of it he didn't take it all away i thought we were messiahs i thought we were little eagles i thought he connected us with that now it was in one man now send many people but how many somebody walked up to you anybody said well you remember that woman walked up to brother brown said brother brown said you forgive them people they're sin says you you acting like god he said wasn't too far from the truth he didn't say no no no no no he said wasn't too far from the truth so how we going to destroy death that's been the biggest question and it's just like i told you wednesday night somebody answer this how do you eat an elephant one piece at a time nothing special one piece at a time that's what we're doing we're chewing this thing one piece at a time we're going to make it this is perfect love now let's go down to number nine because we know what happened we know we went across the curtain of time and he said are these all branhams they said no they're your converts now let's go to number nine the hebrew series now watch the first is perfect love that's god's love pure and unadulterated the next coming there is filial love that's love that you have for your wife and your children the next drops that is lustful love the next is ungodly love and just goes on down till it's filled keep going on perverting and perverting he said everything has a beginning has to have an end listen felio love had a beginning lustful love had a beginning all agape love never had a beginning that is always eternal never will not be eternal agape love because listen the love of god is why this plan is eternal it's the love of god that he did not let us just go ahead and just the whole the whole world just die and just go off into oblivion and never to be remembered again he could have done that but he did not he knew there'd be a group of people that would yearn and groan and and burst the doors open if they had to to get in the church but see you can do that with filial love but if you bring that together and take it back up to agape love see agape love's not you know i love june as much as i i i more than i love anybody else but that's filial love because she's not born and i'm not born again there's no agape love if you're not born again amen that's why we can fellowship under agape love and it doesn't turn into that's why you see and and i'm just going to make it plain that's why you see many ministers even in the message and even out in the world they get caught with women and all these different things brother brown said money women in popularity were the three things you had to watch out for he knew that why because there was a spirit carried with each one of those and being a minister i was hoping dad would cover it this morning but see as a minister you have to be careful yeah because you are attractive even though ugly as we are we're attract the people bob don't laugh so hard you couldn't you didn't have to amend that nobody had amen now you get a looking kid though you got a problem with it but you understand though there's there's things comes with that there's an anointing there's a pull there's you don't want to you don't ever you know you don't want to be that's why when brother dale or any of us talk to you as a sister there is either our wife in there or something the door's open you understand what i mean because see that felio love gets so close to that agape love and then all of a sudden it it agape love can't go downward feel your love can go downward it can take you into lust and i just read it ungodly acts and all these different things so there is an anointing to that that you're born with but it's how you use it right didn't brother brown say they talked about pat boone he talked about uh elvis presley had an anointing on them but they took that anointing and sold it to the world and man i'm not gonna as like brother dale said he said um and and the analogy to this is is you know you you go to family reunions or something and and somebody's become a doctor and everybody's like oh man they're a doctor they've achieved something well what do you do well i'm a pastor of church okay no that's the highest office there is in the world er way past the president way past the senator way past a a stupid television personality a youtuber yeah a tick tocker deanna what's tick-tock i thought that was a clock no it's not i found that out see how that perverted though so you watch everybody all you watch because it starts going downward if you don't have agape love everything rolls downward and man so you and you're where you're getting further away from god not closer to god so be careful if you just live under feel your love that's my whole part just don't live underfield your love just make sure you get the baptism of the holy ghost that will hold you and will keep you in the time of trouble let's go to number 12. i'm going to skip a few of these if you don't mind and we'll uh want to look at this chart real quick then we'll go downstairs and eat some ice creams go to number 12. adoption see we're still an adoption series brother brown said look he said thus sayeth the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place he's talking about the sixth dimension for that's all there was there no matter how much how much religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of god till you can love those that hate you i wrote myself a note i said look don't misrepresent that love with greasy grace don't rip misrepresent that love for just having affection because i'm going to tell you something if you're a child of god and you do something wrong you're going to pay for it you're going to pay for it and if you don't take the correction you know what it shows that you never had to start with you never had nothing to take you back to the correction because you're a bastard child and a bastard child is not a part of the family amen number 13 from this time on columbus falls oregon and i looked and people was coming from everywhere and i said what is this that voice now from no one the same voice that spoke the room is still with me says this is perfect love i've always taught the evidence of the holy ghost is perfect love see i believe in speaking in tongues sure but though i speak with tongue of men and angels wow and have not charity i'm nothing he's quoting scripture i am nothing become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so when you speak with tongues and got love with it that'll show now see that's where he puts everything back together he's saying well i'm not throwing tongues out i hope we start and you know the nine spiritual gifts that brother dale's talking about when you say when i say nine spiritual gifts you go to two yeah most of you cannot give me the other seven yeah right i'm just gonna put you on the spot most of you can't don't look in your bible don't cheat what's another one thank you what's another one faith wisdom was the next one huh discernment there's a few more and i can't really name them all but everybody says oh we got to have the nine spiritual gifts speaking in tongues and interpretation major not a minor that's the last two what about we do have gifts of wisdom in this church we do have give gifts of faith of knowledge and all the different things in this church working in this church but you say well you don't got no gifts because you don't have tongues and interpretation that's just part of it that's not all of it it's the nine spiritual gifts maybe if you'll read them it'll be easier for brother they'll preach next time yeah amen look at number 14. just remember i'll say this with the faith that i have in that vision whatever it was i'll speak in the name of the lord except you have that perfect faith you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it look your spirit would be out of place there now let me ask you a question if you're born again today your spirit is out of place to the world amen your spirit is out of place in this world if you think when you go home today there's i was watching people in the airport the other day we were going to arizona and i was watching people and a man and his wife and two kids come and sit in front of us they were discussing things and you know i don't know exactly but here's the way i see the conversation you know they're going snowboarding they're going to phoenix because they can snowboard you know there's a big mountain there you can still snowboard off of so they're going to snowboard and then they're going to do this and then they're going to do that he gets on the phone and she goes and does her and i know they're not believers i mean they all had on shorts and you understand what i mean so i know they could be nominal christian but what were they doing their spirit was familiar with the world their spirit and i'm not saying you don't need to do that i'm just saying their spirit was so familiar though that if you would say hey we're gonna have church service sunday and you're gonna be right there in flagstaff just come and have service with us it's only going to be maybe 20 miles from your snowboarding event well then look at you and what do you mean we're out here to snowboard we're not here to have fun we're on vacation what are you asking us to go to church see but if what if it had the same spirit that gave it right what if you'd had the same spirit that gave it right if you got the same spirit that gave it then it will react and say oh there's a church there 20 minutes away i mean the first time and we were thinking about going hunting in illinois i searched high and low i called brother larry harry i called it a lot brother joel forney i called everybody i knew that knew where these little churches were spread out and southern illinois is a is it they're dead they ain't a messy church within two hours of their that place but we knew brother byler was there when you brother richard hyatt was there right on the way up and right on the way back so we made our journey based on that because you know what my my spirit now listen i don't have a i don't have a problem with hunting on sunday if i'm way off somewhere i don't now brother dale's made a pact with god that he wasn't going to do that but now brother brown said if you were far enough off so you understand what i mean i'm not so dogmatic but if you're around somewhere that you're you're free you're familiar spirit like one day brother dale and then were in colorado and couldn't well they weren't a message church where they were at anyway him and brother mike and a couple other brothers they met in a cafe and just had a little church service why they was familiar their spirits were familiar they wanted to go to church they wanted to do things you know birds of a feather flock together and all those different things but look if your spirit your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there'd be no way for it to come how many people have you seen come into this church sometimes think they're gonna go to that one they get real nervous and they leave pretty quick when the service is over or they look around and they realize they're in the wrong church i'm not saying anything i'm just saying that maybe that familiar that spirit they have is not familiar with the spirit that's in here or vice versa you understand what i'm saying your spirit you say no that's for them people in the sixth dimension listen if you ain't got that same spirit you ain't going there because the spirit you got is not familiar with that place but if you'll get the baptism of the holy ghost say look no more than it would be for a grain of corn to raise up out of the ground without a germ of life in it it'd be horrible to see corn up this tall out in my garden and not one ear on it yeah we'll see but look that's not the characteristics of the corn unless it's been i guess unless it's been the gene's been but it's got a german life in it it's got to produce what it is same way with me and you your german wife will produce listen and in this day and time you can't hide it this is not the hiding time you cannot hide this at all let's listen watch this next one way of have fellowship 1955 number 15. listen to this i'd rather have a church listen just a moment i'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ now if you cut it off right there you say well brother brown didn't believe in spiritual gifts what he's saying is we're not going to hold on that that's what christ is but watch all right i'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound hard on a pentecostal group but i would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there's gifts they'll bring confusion now he's talking about the gifts they were talking about where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love now watch you'd have perfect gifts so he's not doing away with the gift he was doing away with what they thought the gift was see that whole group of pentecostals was sitting there saying if you don't in their mind all right little man if you don't tell these people that speaking in tongues is the evidence you're wrong that's what he was picking up the spirit of the other people he said no you can speak in tongues all you want to you have all that kind of gifts but if you've got a gothic love look and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts that's the way to do it right there get to get the new birth get the perfect love then that brings fellowship and fellowship will bring the gifts what it'll bring the right gift now let's look at number 16. this is christ revealed in his own word that laodicean church is naked blind miserable don't even know it see it's that anointed anointed with the real spirit see that holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word see how i don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets to the spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love god and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right jesus said many would come in that day that word is what settles it number 17 perfect faith sorry bob and when we were sinners i'm going to read the quote anyway you might read it too he said he's going to preach on perfect faith wednesday night so and when we preachers can't get together and talk to each other about nothing we'll get each other's well anyway and when we were sinners alienated without god pretty awful isn't it in the world in that muck of mud have i hit anybody yet should have been the whole congregation especially those of you that are asleep as i talked about this morning god come to us god sought you you never sought god no man can come to me except the father draws him first and god came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you not with a not with felio love can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word not a confidence in the gifts and all that confidence in his word now the word listen gifts is part of the word but if you don't get the giver first if you don't get the perfect love first and the perfect faith first then you will what brother brown said the pentecostals they cabbage down on what just those two gifts exactly and it didn't go any further there was all that other to go to and they they what they turned it down because they didn't have a confidence of course it wasn't a word for them we should have confidence real genuine love will create a confidence in his word i'm gonna read these quotes right here real quick matthew or matthew 7 verse 21 they don't have it and then we'll look at the chart for a minute and then we'll go downstairs matthew 7 verse 21 says not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day now he didn't say one or two many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works matthew 7 verse 23 says and then i will profes profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now that word new is not like i knew this brother right here or this sister right here that new goes back to where adam knew his wife eve in other words they had an intimate relationship he's telling the people you loved me with filial love right but you never entered in and and loved me with agape love you loved me so far but you didn't go any further you didn't you didn't seek me so much to where everything i give you is agape love listen to this be certain of god sometimes faith will do great miracles and still doesn't come from a spiritual heart oh my goodness do not our lord say many will come in that day and have not done this and done that i will confess to them depart from me what is iniquity is something that you know to do right and don't do it i never knew you he will say and we're living in that day so he penned it right here queen of sheba 1959 what a disappointment it's going to be a judgment when men who thought that they were all right because they had faith to heal the sick they had faith to operate a gift and had great meetings great evangelistic services and one soul let that sink in and one souls in other words god used them to bring somebody to christ and they didn't have christ in them themselves jesus has forewarned us of these things many will come to me in that day and say lord have i not cast out devils and your name done many mighty works then he would then he said he would confess depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than joining a church it takes the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls and unite us together as one great christian body moving for one objective one objective and one goal and that's the body change but remember don't jump up and get that diploma right off the bat ain't going to happen you got to go through listen this message was given to us to give us the opportunity to take a body change it gave us all the others too it gave us everything else the spiritual gifts he like brother brown lined everything up for us that was the elijah spirit where he lined everything up remember the elijah in the old testament the prophets of baal they jumped on the altar so much till they knocked every stone off of its place and what the bible say elijah restored the altar in other words that spirit of elijah took the pieces those stones those revelations that they didn't get and he what he rebuilt that altar when he rebuilt the altar what happened god came down and vindicated that prophet he didn't just consume the sacrifice he consumed the water that was in the hole around it amen so now joe if you want to pull up that real quick we'll be done right here about five minutes we hadn't been talking about this some of you have around there or you can get one of these right here we've been talking about right here this is what we've been on is redemption and we did this a long time ago and and uh brother joe found it again so we got it so the world as we know it is light life and matter which is the first three dimensions then here's the adam and eve and the creation see remember they were not down here right genesis 2 16 17 luke 3 38 adam and eve fell in genesis 3. well where'd they fall they fell down to time nobody got that say amen they failed a time this is the timeline this is where time where we've got days and weeks and months and years this is a timeline that goes all the way from when they fail the fall that's why they call it a fall because they fail they fell to time but now see god still had to what he then death came on the scene there had to be a here's paradise abel genesis 4 8 abel went into paradise we already read who all went into paradise because look jesus christ hadn't died yet they were covered under the blood sacrifice of bulls and goats but it didn't do away with sin it only covered their sin we read that so nobody in the old testament had the new birth even john the baptist did not have the new birth now he had the holy spirit on his spirit not in the soul because the kingdom started right here on the day of pentecost here's the seventh dimension listen god never came out he's still he can get he's in that sixth seventh dimension you got that now watch what happened we're gonna go right here and then we'll quit because i want to go to right here before we preach and then we'll start next next sunday so the first person to die was abel so he went into a place called paradise now look those who turn god down though there is a fifth dimension look how long that fifth dimension is jesus preached to the ones who turned god down in first peter 3 18-19 we read that see they're never going to live until the white throne judgment right they're going to be in a place of like a complete nightmare then the second resume resurrection is going to happen this is the white throne judgment everybody got that now me and you we drop down here into time this is us church ages holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost it's been what putting people in the body of christ then we're going to take a rapture so we're going to be all up here safe because this is all going to be destruction down here because also remember paradise was emptied out when jesus came up when he died went down preached to people in hell come back up on resurrection morning everybody got that now we'll stop right there you still got it still paradise though was emptied out here and become the sixth dimension now remember the six dimensions gonna be emptied out on the right in the rapture of the bride that six dimension is going to be totally emptied out and you're not going to see it anymore because what are we going to do they're going to come here walk 30 or 40 days then we're going up in a rapture up into this dimension where there's there's no sixth it's all seventh because see where we're going to meet god we're gonna meet god where in the air he's gonna take us up to a wedding supper and he's gonna be there amen he's gonna be right there with us the whole time if you want one of these you can come get it there's some in the back back there but that's where we're going to get to we're going to talk a little bit about the 7th dimension next sunday and then continue down our line but but it took 15 sermons to get us to about right here to get right here where the birth of jesus is but everybody understand what i'm saying we place this this is all part of redemption glory even the fifth dimension there's got to be dimensions inside of dimensions because we know the sixth dimension was everybody got that the six dimensions got dimensions in it because brother brad said where's where's paul well if he was in the sixth dimension and we know paul made it to the sixth dimension but like the angel told brother branham he said you'll be gathered with your people the bible tells us he goes back into where jacob and i've been reading in the kings and in first and second samuel every time a king died or every time a good one died like solomon and david they were gathered with their people and they're put into it into a holding place so same way brother branham is waiting now brother ray is in that place he's not he's not conversing with martin luther he's not conversing with john wesley he's probably still hanging around brother dick so but you know what thank god that's more real than we are that has substance to it this you're saying oh this is this is hard this no that's got more substance than anything that's eternal there's no part of that not eternal here we are here we're now eternal in our soul but we're still human in our body we have a cocklebur that we're living in but we're going to another place we're going to contend that this kuckerberg is going to be changed into a wheat right here in front of the devil in his playground in his eden in his place of worship this is satan's eden right this is satan's place of worship it's just where he's wanted to be because he wants to deceive as many as he can let's stand our feet musicians come but eternal redemption that's right started before the foundation of the world and never will end you know what when we get over on the other side we keep running into eternity we're going to know that that man named jesus died for us and he didn't have to he's our father he's our brother he's everything to me y'all seen that song didn't you he's everything he's everything to me you don't have to say whatever you want to say here is the original life oh sure let's sing that give a give a give a page number out we're going to sing that page 376. um can i borrow this key of f [Music] 376 if you don't know what we're going to sing this he'd hear what he said this one brother ray's favorite song you know what he became a part of that original life that's why he's over in that other dimension [Music] all right god's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age we have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message and we know [Music] the original sea the original world is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original [Music] this is what the scriptures say and our names are seen within religion [Music] [Applause] the original light the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seven [Music] the original light it's the original i think the original sea the original world is [Music] glory hallelujah [Music] is what i believe the son of man it's revealed of 17 minutes until the original life is the original life [Music] is [Music] amen we are called into adoption full authority and power sleep in saints will wake and join us for translation in that hour you know all this when you first come in the message or you first come to the lord a lot of things are they're not fairy tales but it's something that you say well i don't know if i can attain to that or not well see that'd be the first thing zach would do if he went down here to to emory university and walked in and said i want to be a surgeon they'd walk him through and they'd watch him do an operation or watch him do some something you know in science and it'd be overwhelming wouldn't it real overwhelming wasn't it but you know what that guy that was operating on the table was sitting in the same place he was sitting in six or eight years before that so what am i saying it takes that time it takes that responsibility number one to say hey i'm gonna be a surgeon i'm gonna be a doctor so all right if you're gonna be a doctor this is what you're gonna do all right so if you wanna take a body change this is what you got to do eat the elephant one bite at a time but if you fall off and don't do what the word says then you know you have to stop for a little while you may you may have to uh you know we always talked about uh skipping grades and and then some were unfortunate enough to get held back a year why because they didn't understand all the teeth that's not anything to say you know derogatory but the same way in the word of god [Music] it's what you eat it's what you feel that's important because that can put his whole life into going to school and and become a wonderful surgeon or he can go down there and he can party and he can you know understand what a man you can part of your way through school well you ain't gonna graduate yeah okay same way with the word of god you say part well you know a lot of times if you don't have agape love i'm telling you if you don't have agape love you will head toward filial love and it'll start rolling downhill every time because satan loves that filial love because he wants you that's why it's called filial love because it feels good agape love most of the time don't feel real good when god's hammering on you and trying to get you straightened down trying to chisel them pieces off of you listen i don't think it's chiseling time folks i think brother brown where brother brown said now it's time that you got to just take the sandpaper with michelangelo he beat them big pieces off of that statue and there was big chunks laying on the floor but when he got ready to do his detailed work he used little fine sandpaper and he got right down there close and he he'd sand this part and sand this part none of this big knocking off we've been through all that we've been through that let's get down to the fine points the honey brother brown said this is the honing age well that what honing is not chopping big chunks off honing is getting what your knife real sharp it's honing it down to a razor's edge so that we can get uh are they ready okay all right well god bless you we love you with love with lord we're gonna go downstairs and eat cake and ice cream and when we dismiss just head on down there and if you don't want to get too crowded inside it's a beautiful day outside you can go sit outside if you want to do a little social distance then because you can't eat cake with that thing you got on your face right so you'll have to eat with your mask off so go downstairs and just kind of separate a little bit and enjoy brother dale's birthday 81 years old so we're going to uh there's some gifts down there for him um just love on sister mary and uh loving sister kathy and the family brother micah and both both grandmas and the sister but love on them with the love of the lord we love you anything we can do for you you just feel free to ask and uh we pray that um pray that you had a good day in the lord today i've had any day that i can come to church and meet my brothers and sisters i've had a good day amen amen let's bow our heads the heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray now as we go downstairs lord and honor our pastor with his birthday that you'll sanctify the food that we're about to partake of lord that you'll give it to us for the nurse of our bodies be with us on the highways on the way home be with the ones that are sick that weren't here today not be able to come i pray that you would lord sanctify us for this journey even those with the baptism of the holy ghost we ask for a sanctification again lord to keep us clean a daily sanctification where paul says i die daily lord just bless us and take care of us be with us until we come back together on wednesday night give brother bob lord the words to speak to us because we know they'll come from you father if he'll just yield itself to you lord we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you're dismissed god bless you god's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last stage
