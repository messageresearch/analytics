[0:00] okay
[0:01] this is probably the last one on
[0:03] knowledge we're gonna
[0:05] let bread around them give us some
[0:09] Insight on
[0:11] knowledge because we we see the first
[0:14] thing we we look at
[0:19] but looks the first thing I said was
[0:21] what was it that we were looking at
[0:24] um
[0:26] discernment what's the first thing he's
[0:29] what is what is discernment the judge
[0:32] that's what judging is
[0:34] so the knowledge and the statue of a
[0:37] perfect man
[0:39] is to be able to judge or discern right
[0:44] from wrong
[0:49] right
[0:52] okay okay hello
[0:56] hello
[1:11] it's not working
[1:13] let's see let's see if we can make it
[1:16] work just hang on just a second you know
[1:18] this technology
[1:21] hello hello
[1:28] oh well it'll pick it up on that it
[1:31] should okay all right let's read what
[1:34] brother Randall says about knowledge all
[1:36] right it says and then thirdly brother
[1:39] Brown says in the Statue of perfect man
[1:41] paragraph 160 and thirdly you add
[1:44] knowledge knowledge now that don't mean
[1:46] worldly knowledge because that's
[1:47] foolishness to God
[1:48] but knowledge to judge judge what right
[1:52] from wrong how do you judge it then if
[1:54] you've got Christian knowledge
[1:57] with your virtue and Faith you judge
[2:00] whether the word is right or wrong
[2:03] and if you can lay aside all your creeds
[2:07] and all your unbelief everything that
[2:10] you claim you've done then you have
[2:12] knowledge to believe that God cannot
[2:13] allow that every word man's being a word
[2:15] be word be alive but mine be true
[2:19] now you're getting knowledge that
[2:21] Supreme knowledge
[2:23] you don't have to have four degrees in
[2:25] some college or something like that to
[2:26] have it because all these virtues were
[2:28] given to you by God the place upon the
[2:30] foundation of your faith that you might
[2:32] come to the full statue of a real living
[2:34] man of God yes sir add knowledge because
[2:36] knowledge of his word you must believe
[2:40] it in this way such as you should
[2:42] believe today that accept that the days
[2:44] of miracles did not passed knowledge
[2:46] that what God Said God is able
[2:49] who perform Abraham believed that and
[2:51] with 100 years old he stagger not at the
[2:52] promise of God through unbelief look how
[2:55] ridiculous that word looked here's a man
[2:57] 100 years old looking for a baby
[3:00] could be born into his home by a woman
[3:02] 90 years old
[3:03] almost 50 years past Baron lived with
[3:06] her since she was a young girl and
[3:08] teenager
[3:09] and here he is his life stream was dead
[3:11] and Sarah's womb was dead all hope was
[3:13] gone as far as it was hope
[3:15] but yet against hope he believed in Hope
[3:17] because he had knowledge that God was
[3:19] able to keep everything
[3:20] that he promised now when you got it
[3:22] like that then add it to your face so
[3:24] here we go back to what we were talking
[3:26] about add to what you believe add to
[3:29] what your faith is
[3:31] knowledge all right when you get true
[3:33] birth you added to your faith when you
[3:35] can walk out here on the street live
[3:36] like a Christian act like a Christian be
[3:38] a Christian add that to your faith
[3:41] when you have knowledge you say well I
[3:43] don't know now whether this scripture is
[3:44] just right now here's Acts 2 38 then he
[3:47] goes through that because you haven't
[3:49] got knowledge enough to know of God yet
[3:51] that the Bible doesn't contradict itself
[3:53] leave it alone don't say no more about
[3:54] it see leave it alone
[3:56] but when you can see that the scripture
[3:58] is not contradictory
[3:59] and let me say when you can see that the
[4:01] message of the hour is not contradictory
[4:04] all right like they're trying to say now
[4:05] that brother Brown was right here and
[4:07] around here well that's not
[4:10] Holy Ghost knowledge all right so that's
[4:12] the knowledge of man
[4:19] because I think that that you know these
[4:21] virtues have been impartiality but
[4:23] they've they're coming into full
[4:24] manifestation now
[4:27] um
[4:28] you know you you take
[4:30] now and you say now as far as long as we
[4:33] are that brother random was wrong here
[4:34] and right here and all these things and
[4:36] he he said this wrong whatever I you
[4:39] know you
[4:41] there's no excuse for that that's right
[4:44] see there was an excuse for Luther if
[4:46] you say excuse me Luther had a Luther
[4:48] had a knowledge but now remember his
[4:51] knowledge only took him so far
[4:54] in the word the judge shall live by
[4:56] faith
[4:57] but he was a trinitarian
[5:00] he was the Catholic but he baptized in
[5:03] the name father son Holy Ghost say God
[5:05] winged at that ignorance of the man
[5:07] but he had enough enough little bit of
[5:10] knowledge just a little bit of knowledge
[5:11] to say that just shall live by faith and
[5:13] God built his church on that then Wesley
[5:16] and then Pentecost and now we're coming
[5:18] into the full manifestation of the word
[5:20] we can't be saying that the prophet of
[5:24] the hour
[5:25] just brought part of the word
[5:28] that's what I said you know Wednesday
[5:29] night I I want to be able to know what
[5:32] brother Brown said after 1965. right
[5:35] amen and like brother Joe Canada he came
[5:38] in he said you know what he said I want
[5:40] to know what Jesus said after his
[5:41] Ascension yeah
[5:43] yeah same thing
[5:45] because before it is Ascension
[5:48] you get father son Holy Ghost baptisms
[5:50] you get all kind of isms and schisms
[5:52] even when he was here
[5:54] God in human flesh walking around they
[5:56] called him all kinds of things they said
[5:57] his Doctrine was wrong they said this
[5:59] just like they did Brother brown but
[6:01] after the Holy Ghost came back onto
[6:02] their Pentecost when Peter walks up what
[6:05] his first name Peter does say repent and
[6:07] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[6:09] so I want to know what brother Rhymes
[6:11] that after 65 and what Jesus said after
[6:13] his Ascension
[6:15] because that to me is
[6:18] the perfection
[6:20] of a perfect man
[6:22] is knowing we have been given a message
[6:25] but take that message and then apply it
[6:28] in its pure form not partial in its pure
[6:31] form
[6:32] in the end time that's why brother Brown
[6:34] said we had to have the full restoration
[6:36] of the word because they had pieces here
[6:38] and pieces here
[6:39] but that knowledge in the Statue of a
[6:41] perfect man that knowledge now to get us
[6:45] to the Capstone Revelation has got to be
[6:48] the perfect knowledge of God it has to
[6:50] be the absolute Mind Of God because Paul
[6:52] said we have the mind of Christ in life
[6:54] we were preaching Wednesday night
[6:56] if you have the mind of Christ you are
[6:58] able to understand what he said because
[7:00] if you got his mind
[7:02] but what brother Brown was talking about
[7:03] he said we put our own Creeds into it
[7:05] what we bring our own knowledge in we
[7:07] bring our own thoughts and ideas and
[7:10] that's what they're doing in the message
[7:10] now they're bringing their own thoughts
[7:12] in surely they've got quotes
[7:15] Jesus had quotes
[7:18] remember you remember
[7:20] Nicodemus and gamalia
[7:24] they were conversing
[7:27] and remember Camellia or one of them
[7:29] said well you know wasn't there a guy
[7:30] come out here and led
[7:32] 100 and something in the desert or 70 or
[7:34] 80 or whatever how many amount it was
[7:36] then he come by and said he was a
[7:37] messiah and he led these people out in
[7:39] the desert
[7:40] and Camellia or one of them said hey if
[7:42] it be of God it'll approve itself in
[7:44] other words if it's not of God it'll be
[7:46] just like that well see they were
[7:47] they're showing that there was people
[7:50] I've always said there was there's many
[7:51] jesuses during Jesus time there wasn't
[7:53] just one man named Jesus
[7:57] but there was only one man named Jesus
[8:00] Christ
[8:02] all right because he was born Lord to
[8:04] Christ there was his identification
[8:06] Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the
[8:08] sin of the world now now probably John
[8:11] knew a bunch of Jesus's but there's no
[8:12] way he could say that about that person
[8:14] because that person was truly identified
[8:17] remember what they told John John
[8:20] whoever you see the spirit
[8:22] fall upon and remain
[8:25] John being a prophet he could see the
[8:27] Spirit fall on people prophesy like
[8:29] campus and then the spirit leaving well
[8:32] he knew that wasn't a messiah
[8:34] right but when that Spirit came on that
[8:37] River Jordan and it remained and and
[8:39] John saw the manifestation of what was
[8:42] going on
[8:43] he said there's one
[8:45] that's the one that's that's the Messiah
[8:48] and uh
[8:50] his name was Jesus Christ
[8:52] that identifies him with what we were
[8:54] talking about in that Genesis 1 that
[8:56] Christ
[8:57] in Genesis 1 26 has now come down into a
[8:59] man
[9:00] and he come to save us because we can't
[9:02] save ourself we had to have a man come
[9:05] save us all right but that's we're
[9:07] worldly knowledge and people's knowledge
[9:09] of of what brother Brown said listen
[9:12] knowledge of what he said not a
[9:15] revelation of what he said
[9:16] all right
[9:17] because truly every Doctrine in this
[9:21] message came out of the message
[9:25] it didn't come from James Dobson and
[9:28] they're not quoting these people out
[9:30] here they're quoting brother Branham
[9:32] so that's where the that's where the
[9:34] fallacies are coming from they put in
[9:37] their own idea into one quote or a
[9:40] series of quotes or a set of quotes that
[9:43] they see that it's over on this side
[9:45] they put their own idea to it that's not
[9:47] godly knowledge
[9:50] brother Brown says but when you can see
[9:52] that the scripture is not contradictory
[9:53] well when you can see the message is not
[9:55] contradictory
[9:56] all right that you can say that and can
[9:59] see that by the revelation of God
[10:03] now watch what he says
[10:05] the whole word is wrote in mystery
[10:07] that's right
[10:09] the prophet's message is written in
[10:11] Mysteries
[10:13] he was probably the most misunderstood
[10:15] man that ever lived on the face of this
[10:16] earth right
[10:18] right besides Jesus Christ right
[10:20] I mean look what they've got I mean
[10:22] they're picking his life apart now
[10:25] so what big deal he's human
[10:27] he was a human man he had human desires
[10:30] he had wife he had children you know he
[10:32] could have he could have been a maybe I
[10:34] was working now he could have been a
[10:36] monk and just he that's what he wanted
[10:38] to do remember he went he said God I
[10:39] want to go up in the mountains
[10:41] be like Elijah grow me a beard and run
[10:43] out and say thus death the Lord and go
[10:45] back in he said no that's not what you
[10:47] were made for you were made to live
[10:49] among your people
[10:53] but the whole world word is wrote in
[10:56] Mysteries and only the knowledge of God
[11:00] okay I'm revealing
[11:02] only not the knowledge of man because
[11:05] that gets your ideas
[11:06] but only the knowledge of God can reveal
[11:09] it
[11:10] and then when you get in say punctuate
[11:13] every word of God with an amen then add
[11:15] that to your faith
[11:18] now look then add that to your faith
[11:22] not it
[11:24] per se added to it first
[11:26] you got to grow in Grace and knowledge
[11:30] and then somewhere you've got to come to
[11:32] that knowledge that's why this true
[11:33] whole the knowledge and the statue of a
[11:35] perfect man it's not just partial
[11:37] knowledge because Luther had partial
[11:39] knowledge and he wasn't adopted he
[11:42] didn't get up here
[11:43] he had his for the day
[11:45] but he wasn't a manifested Son of God
[11:48] like me like we need in the end time
[11:51] and only the knowledge of God can reveal
[11:54] it then when you get and say punctuate
[11:56] every word of God within amen then
[11:58] add that to your faith
[12:02] oh you're getting to be a pretty good
[12:03] man right now see you're coming up see
[12:05] what with with faith virtue than
[12:07] knowledge see how it's building this man
[12:09] there's no what's look at that you can
[12:12] see there's no way escaping it
[12:15] this is the way
[12:17] to become to the full statue of Christ
[12:19] yes sir
[12:21] to judge judge Wright judge whether it's
[12:24] right or wrong to believe God's word
[12:25] judge whether it's right or wrong
[12:27] whether I should serve a Creed or serve
[12:29] God judge whether it's right or wrong I
[12:31] should be born again or join a church
[12:33] then you begin
[12:35] judge Wright when the preacher says the
[12:38] days of Miracles the past the Bible says
[12:39] Jesus Christ same yesterday damn forever
[12:41] now what you're going to believe
[12:42] when you say I'll take God now you don't
[12:45] say that just to say it
[12:46] well I take it just from your heart but
[12:49] something in you
[12:52] something in you
[12:55] your faith pushes out there
[12:58] there you are your faith says I know
[13:00] he's the same because remember it's not
[13:03] wrong to
[13:06] listen to me now it's not wrong to
[13:08] question God's word
[13:09] Abraham questioned God's word
[13:13] he did he laughed at God right he said
[13:16] me and Sarah said me here take Hagar
[13:20] so there you know but you come to the
[13:23] end time now where our faith says I know
[13:26] he's the same
[13:28] I've witnessed him the same there's
[13:30] nothing can take it away from me I know
[13:32] he's real amen then add that to your
[13:35] faith
[13:36] see to me knowledge is not just whatever
[13:38] all of a sudden you're just going to get
[13:40] knowledge
[13:41] that's what I said before it's got to be
[13:43] a birth it's got to be something even up
[13:44] through the statue of a perfect man all
[13:46] the way up to to Divine love
[13:49] you're going to have to grow in Grace
[13:52] and knowledge you're not going to get it
[13:54] all dumped on you at once and sometimes
[13:56] you know you you uh you preach into a
[13:58] congregation and you see the eyebrows
[14:00] and their furl their eyebrows go down
[14:01] like this or they start scrambling
[14:03] through their Bible and like Daddy said
[14:05] about the brother that
[14:07] that when Daddy said to give ten
[14:09] thousand dollars you know the new
[14:10] brother you know we're sitting back
[14:11] there and said I'll give you ten
[14:12] thousand dollars if you can find where
[14:13] anybody would baptizing them follow us
[14:15] on Holy Ghost
[14:17] here we go
[14:21] do you know what he done he closes the
[14:23] Bible laid it down right because it's
[14:26] not there
[14:27] well see that was Holy Ghost knowledge
[14:28] talking to somebody with partial
[14:30] knowledge
[14:33] knowledge of a father son Holy Ghost
[14:34] baptism that he'd never heard anything
[14:36] else before all right
[14:38] so we come to him we got to come to a
[14:41] knowledge number one you do come to a
[14:43] knowledge that you're lost
[14:45] you come to knowledge that you're lost
[14:48] then you get Faith and that Faith what
[14:51] does it do it doesn't stop your
[14:52] knowledge it expands expands your
[14:54] knowledge it makes your knowledge
[14:55] greater right like I told you many times
[14:58] before when brother Harris was preaching
[15:01] and I'm looking at predestination of it
[15:03] has some I have some human questions
[15:07] one question in the word I was
[15:09] questioning how to put it together
[15:13] and it's just like I was watching
[15:16] brother Harris preach but all of a
[15:18] sudden it wasn't it wasn't words on page
[15:20] and it wasn't a book popped up but it
[15:22] was like a book comes up in front of me
[15:24] and it just starts doing this well when
[15:26] it starts unfolding it's not like it was
[15:28] written on there and I could read it it
[15:30] was what my intelligence
[15:33] I believe it was the Holy Ghost speaking
[15:35] to me
[15:36] showing me and it was running through my
[15:38] brain going back to the scriptures going
[15:40] back to the prophet's message we'll see
[15:42] to me that's Holy Ghost knowledge when
[15:44] you see that and you can put it in there
[15:46] and it lays right on top of each other
[15:50] then you know one thing for sure
[15:52] now it doesn't mean I knew everything
[15:53] about
[15:55] predestination either but he sure
[15:57] answered the question I had on
[15:58] predestination
[16:00] and then you know brother now preaching
[16:01] on foreign always just made it even
[16:03] greater
[16:05] to me that to me I tell you to me that's
[16:07] probably one of the greatest
[16:09] Mysteries that's been solved
[16:14] you can grow me or not if you want to
[16:16] that's one of the greatest Mysteries
[16:18] that's been solved in this church is
[16:20] bringing the the mystery of foreign
[16:25] been there the whole time been laying
[16:28] there the whole time we've been reading
[16:30] it we look and we even read we uh you
[16:33] know those who before knew he did
[16:34] pre-estimate we just keep reading right
[16:36] on through that those before then you
[16:37] take somebody that looks and says hey
[16:39] those he foreknew
[16:42] that's got to be first
[16:43] he did predestining so foreknowledge is
[16:46] first so if you take foreign
[16:50] knowledge foreknowledged to me satisfies
[16:52] every quote and every scripture that
[16:55] seems I said scenes in our head
[16:57] contradictory
[16:59] I said scenes contradictory it's not
[17:02] contradictory but there's got to be an
[17:04] answer brother Brown said if you've got
[17:06] a question got to put a man in the
[17:08] Pulpit to give you that answer all right
[17:09] yeah
[17:10] to me to me the revelation of
[17:13] predestination makes a late Pride
[17:17] the people who feel that they can be
[17:19] here
[17:20] that's correctness
[17:24] and to know when you realize it there's
[17:27] no right
[17:29] they take away all
[17:31] they take away all the attributes of God
[17:34] as far as a savior a redeemer coming
[17:37] here to give his life they take all that
[17:39] away
[17:40] so it's just like I've said it if I'm
[17:43] wrong or brother Dale's wrong
[17:46] then you know just let it stay that way
[17:48] because to me I'd rather know I've lost
[17:51] and that God found me and I responded it
[17:54] was my choice to respond I was I was you
[17:57] know what I was doing I was just playing
[17:59] my godship
[18:01] I was just playing my godship because
[18:04] brother Brown said God will not go
[18:05] override your free moral agency override
[18:08] God won't override your choice
[18:11] he's not gonna make you do anything if
[18:13] not then he's not just he's not a just
[18:16] God all right just like we were talking
[18:17] about wings tonight okay if you haven't
[18:20] heard Wednesday night service you need
[18:22] to listen to Wednesday night serving
[18:23] whether I preached it or not it just was
[18:25] a good it was something good that you
[18:27] can that you can sink your teeth into
[18:29] yeah what do you think what did they do
[18:33] I I you know I've heard him preach it
[18:35] but I've never heard of it
[18:37] what what what's their answer for
[18:42] Christ's dying for you if they think you
[18:45] come here with that Eternal seating what
[18:48] what's their answer for that the only
[18:50] thing I want to ask them I just want to
[18:51] ask them one thing I wanted to explain
[18:53] to me justification sanctification in
[18:55] the baptism Holy Ghost that's all I want
[18:56] to ask them I don't want to go into
[18:57] anything else explain to me how you get
[19:00] Justified explain to me how you get
[19:01] Sanctified explain to me how you get the
[19:04] Holy Ghost and you always love you
[19:06] colonel
[19:07] brother Brown said the unclean Spirit
[19:09] goes out it's sanctification where was
[19:11] that unclean spirit
[19:12] it was in you
[19:16] so God won't dwell in unclean see the
[19:18] guy it's just a two Soul message wrapped
[19:19] up in a different package they're saying
[19:21] you got two Natures in there two Souls
[19:23] right
[19:25] right and then God you what happens is
[19:27] this one dies and you realize this and
[19:29] always was there
[19:30] all right
[19:31] it's a new training then where's the
[19:35] Salvation issue
[19:36] I just I'm sorry I don't know well both
[19:40] of them don't dwell in their goodness
[19:43] no no no no no but anyway you know what
[19:46] though it's just like you said it's a
[19:48] fleshly manifestation they want to feel
[19:50] good like Trudy said if you have a
[19:53] partial knowledge of predestination your
[19:56] head can swell this big
[19:58] I always was this God I never this and I
[20:02] never was saved on any certain day and
[20:04] well you know what that Genesis 1 26 man
[20:06] never was saved on any certain day all
[20:08] right
[20:09] I think Genesis 126 and I know it
[20:11] shocked some of you because some of you
[20:12] I saw your face Wednesday night Genesis
[20:14] 1 26 don't need salvation
[20:16] right that is your salvation that's
[20:18] right
[20:20] it don't need it
[20:21] that man never fell
[20:23] did he that man never fell Christ Ever
[20:27] Fall if he fell then he needed
[20:30] Redemption I don't want to start
[20:31] preaching him all right this will be for
[20:33] a later sermon we'll we'll take it up a
[20:35] little bit in depth but that Genesis 126
[20:38] that scripture to me just it satisfies
[20:40] everything predestination foreknowledge
[20:44] Redemption salvation
[20:48] because you have to watch what brother
[20:49] Brown says he says you always was
[20:53] eternal he's not looking at that person
[20:55] and saying you always was eternal
[20:57] because even in the churches book he
[20:59] said it's not the part in other words
[21:00] it's not the person I'm looking at that
[21:02] was predestinated eternally from God but
[21:04] the seed or word or may I say the
[21:06] Genesis 1 26 and 27 man
[21:09] the theophany of God that you have at
[21:11] the new birth not at your first birth at
[21:14] your new birth
[21:15] uh it wouldn't be a new birth if you
[21:18] didn't need it
[21:21] Nicodemus poor thing all he had to do
[21:23] was say I believe the message of the
[21:25] hour
[21:26] that seed would just come right to life
[21:29] but anyway
[21:30] but see that that's man's ideas with a
[21:33] bunch of clothes
[21:34] and brother Brown does give you quotes
[21:36] you always was your cologne you never
[21:37] were born only in a certain date yeah
[21:39] that Genesis 1 26 man never was
[21:42] there's not a day in that Genesis 1 26
[21:45] man's life that he ever said one word to
[21:48] sin
[21:49] but you did down here that's why you had
[21:52] to come down here you bypass that we
[21:55] read last time not this past time but
[21:57] the time before who there's no kind of
[21:58] that you bypass that now what's bypassed
[22:01] me you went around it you didn't come
[22:04] straight from God's theophany form Jesus
[22:07] came straight from God's theophany form
[22:09] because he was always here he comes here
[22:12] he comes here born Lord the Christ you
[22:15] weren't born Christ right you become
[22:18] Christ
[22:19] at your new birth right that's right you
[22:23] weren't born Christ
[22:25] you were born in sand shaping iniquity
[22:27] I just like it that way if I'm wrong I
[22:29] just like it that way I'm just just
[22:31] leave it alone
[22:32] I once was and now I ain't you know I
[22:34] once was dead now I'm alive
[22:36] because Paul even said we were dead and
[22:38] trespassing sin dead
[22:40] now we're something live about something
[22:41] dead
[22:44] I was told by a person that Calgary just
[22:47] brought them
[22:49] to the realization that's what they're
[22:51] saying that's what they set out in out
[22:52] there where I was at they said that
[22:54] Calvary just brought you to a
[22:56] realization that you always was a son of
[22:59] God
[23:02] obviously not
[23:04] what I think they're trying to do is
[23:06] they're trying to say that number one
[23:09] I've heard people say that brother
[23:10] Branham changed his doctrine of the new
[23:12] birth he used to teach justification
[23:14] sanctification about them long ago but
[23:16] when the third pull came into
[23:18] manifestation
[23:20] excuse me the opening of the word that
[23:23] that brought us to a realization that we
[23:25] didn't need all that that we always was
[23:27] eternal and that we had it all the time
[23:30] but you know
[23:33] and that was after the seal that's what
[23:34] I've always said they said well that was
[23:36] before the sale after the sale well in
[23:38] 1964 whenever he preached when he
[23:40] preached after that one too and when did
[23:43] he preach to Future home it was a 64
[23:46] right or two it was after the seal
[23:49] he said
[23:50] justification the world goes through
[23:52] justification just like you did the
[23:54] world goes through sanctification just
[23:55] like you did he said thank God he said
[23:58] I've come this far in other words and
[24:00] I'm still preaching the same three works
[24:02] of Grace right well now that's 1964 or
[24:05] 65. he's preaching us into the future
[24:07] home and still preaching on
[24:09] justification sanctification about them
[24:11] all goes now let me explain something
[24:13] real quick and we'll stop right here and
[24:15] we'll I think we've got enough of
[24:16] knowledge everybody kind of knows
[24:19] what's going on with knowledge
[24:23] but what I feel is
[24:26] they just got it out of order
[24:30] they just got it out of order it's just
[24:32] out of order
[24:33] I think the picture just like I said
[24:36] program didn't make that illustration
[24:38] just to say something funny they got the
[24:41] cow
[24:42] they got the grass and they got the tree
[24:44] now if you got the cow eating grass
[24:46] under the tree
[24:47] yeah you're doing great but if you got
[24:49] the cowing grass on top of the tree what
[24:51] their Revelation is
[24:53] is their Revelation is is that it all
[24:57] happened at your natural birth
[25:01] so they said you come here always
[25:03] eternal
[25:04] now we take the same quotes the same
[25:06] scriptures and everything else and apply
[25:08] it after the new new birth
[25:11] if I understand that because they're
[25:12] just saying the new birth brings you
[25:14] just to a knowledge that you always was
[25:15] when I look
[25:17] it does the new birth brings you to a
[25:20] knowledge that you always were right
[25:23] so as now I'm on this side of the
[25:26] Salvation issue
[25:28] okay I'm born again I'm over here I can
[25:32] look back
[25:34] and see that Genesis 1 26 man and know
[25:37] that that man is what's in me now and
[25:40] that's where I was that's my
[25:42] identification
[25:44] I heard from that theophany
[25:47] right I heard from that and then now I
[25:50] can look back and see absolutely I
[25:52] wasn't born on any certain day
[25:57] I never did begin first thing I always
[25:59] was eternal all those Quotes come right
[26:03] in line if you say now I have the new
[26:06] birth and then this happens to me and I
[26:08] receive the Life of Christ I've got I've
[26:10] got a stack of quote This Tall I have
[26:13] been pulling I just went in put new
[26:15] birth and then put in eternal life and
[26:17] put in Primo agency and I had like 3 600
[26:21] quotes and I read through about half of
[26:23] them and I printed off the ones that we
[26:25] needed brother Brown never changed his
[26:27] view on having a free choice or a free
[26:29] Mole agency or free will
[26:32] he said you're still on free more Legacy
[26:34] today well now you can't change if
[26:35] you're on free moral agency today then
[26:37] it's your choice
[26:39] that does the language or nothing I'll
[26:41] just ask later
[26:43] okay but remember
[26:47] without Holy Ghost knowledge
[26:50] you'll make brother Brandon say it's all
[26:52] right to have polygamy
[26:54] it's too soft to you you got two Souls
[26:57] you got seven thunders of the virtues of
[26:59] God you've got brusia everything comes
[27:03] out of from 47 to 65.
[27:09] I'm familiar with the doctrine you're
[27:11] talking about
[27:12] and about the Statue of America
[27:15] they just say once you come to the
[27:18] realization
[27:19] you just seek the holy ghosts
[27:22] so what does that make you do sit down
[27:25] on your death and not do nothing
[27:28] right a lot of kids are out in the world
[27:31] that's why they live worldly lives
[27:32] that's why things happening in in our
[27:35] life if we get dilatory
[27:38] our life too we're not immune from a
[27:40] little bit of it right but when we do
[27:42] come to the knowledge of God
[27:44] that what he said in that message
[27:48] that these
[27:50] uh virtues are required so it's a
[27:54] requirement for us to get this up to
[27:58] even where the apostles work and for
[28:01] this Capstone to come down on us you
[28:04] must have Holy Ghost knowledge
[28:07] not man's knowledge this has nothing to
[28:10] do with man's knowledge we read it he
[28:11] said that's not worldly knowledge
[28:13] it's the knowledge of God and you know
[28:16] what if you don't understand something
[28:17] just say I don't understand it don't say
[28:19] I don't believe it because you know what
[28:20] when you say I don't believe it that
[28:22] puts a little barrier right there
[28:25] right you can't get any further than
[28:26] that just say look I don't understand
[28:27] that to this point and that's the best
[28:30] thing to do because you know what if you
[28:31] have a desire that you know at this
[28:33] point you're not understanding if you
[28:34] have that desire God will put a Man In a
[28:36] Pulpit he'll explain that answer he'll
[28:39] answer that question and then what
[28:40] you'll do is you'll move on to something
[28:42] else
[28:43] add to Europe
[28:51] very much
